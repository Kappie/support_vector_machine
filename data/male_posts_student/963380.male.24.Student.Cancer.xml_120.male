Perhaps an explanation is in order; I love movies, I adore the cinema, I detest distractions that are completely out of sync with the film. In the packed house I was seated towards the front of the auditorium. As the film began, from one aisle and one row back, noises began to erupt. The laughter of a small child, altogether unusual, unexpected, and unwelcome in an action movie flowed forth from the seat behind me. "Great," thought I, "betcha this goes on for the whole movie!" As if prophesied by me the disturbance did continue. Through the din and the cussing, the violent gunfire and the calamatous explosions, and sadly even through the ghostly calm the giggling and crying continued. The nature of my ire was exhibited only through the gentle twitch of my right cheek; it's the cheek that indicates "you're making me angry - you won't like me when I'm angry". I quelled my rage and focussed instead on the pleasant carnage that ran rampant on the screen - a herculean feat, to be certain.  As the film ended and the lights rose, I stood and turned to examine the source of my discontent. As per my expectations I saw a father with his young son and daughter. The young girl was clearly the culprit! I turned to berate her father and... my cry of retribution died in my throat.  The young girl was mentally handicapped.  The split second decision that I made lasted just slightly longer than eternity. I closed my mouth, turned and exited the theatre. I'm not sure if I did the right thing.  Terminator 3 is a movie for adults. It is rated AA, which in Canada is a great way to say "It's an R film that we'd like to make more money from - BRING THE WHOLE FAMILY!". There was nudity, coarse language and violence in so grand a scale that even I was impressed. Is this appropriate entertainment for children, let alone a child whose mental faculties may be diminished? It seemed to me that the young girl was there mostly because dad wanted to be there and was too selfish to wait a few weeks until their presence would be less of a disturbance. I felt guilty for thinking this - after all, is it my place to say when anyone can enjoy anything?   There indeed is where my dilemma falls. I want my money back, not from the theatre, but from an inconsiderate dad.
