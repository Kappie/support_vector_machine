I can't stop thinkin bout the gurl ..... :-\ Im jus so damn happy she's comin back soon. Oh, seein as Becky and some chick named Tina have no idea what I meant by "#16" ... refer to her blog (if ya can) ..... the survey thing.   seriously, I feel like a mushy lil whore. It's gettin harder and harder to stay focused on shit, and I can't help but wonder how you are, what you're doing ... and if you miss me as much as I miss you. The only thing I think about as much is how Id love to in Aaron's shoes.   So what's the word for people like me right now? ..... smitten? Oooooh boy... damn teen years. And I'm just gettin started.
