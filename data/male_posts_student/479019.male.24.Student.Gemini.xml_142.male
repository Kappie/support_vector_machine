I think it's because I put some thought into the content of my work, rather than just make something cute or funny. After that I went home for a nap, and then went to work. Work was long, but cool. Julia, George, Samantha and I all joked around and watched the Laker game, which made the night more bearable. Afterwards, I made it to the short film festival at UCI and met up with Naomi, Julia ( a different one ), Steff, and Janet. Now I'm at home sweet home ready for some relaxation.  ***
