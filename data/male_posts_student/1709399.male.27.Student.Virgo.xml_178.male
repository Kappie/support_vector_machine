Mexico’s President Vicente Fox said that Mexico’s relationship with America has its ups and downs. That’s right. Their people come up here and our jobs go down there.  3. Boy that Britney works quick doesn’t she? She parties with a guy, decides to marry him, goes through with the wedding, gets a lawyer, gets out of the marriage, all in like 50 hours. She’s like J.
