My grades haven't exactly been to hot, and this bieng like the most important year, i have to shape up.  Um, well, it's that, and the fact that i'm just lazy...no, really.  And, um, and prolly cause i had no material, i mean, what am i going to do, just describe my day, everyday? (wait a minute...) Well, anyway, ya, i've got some new shit to share, but before i continue, i have to say, i woke up at like 6 this morning, so i'm  seriously  tired....but i'll do my best to share what i so foundly call....my thoughts....o, and ya, im tired, so sorry about the typos.   yeah, um, i'll start with today.  O man.  Forget it, i mean, it's nothing special, i can't really comment on anything important other than the fact that today is Prom....well, it's a banquet, but everyone is treating it like a prom.   Basically, everyone's there right now, as i'm typing this.  Now,  Why didn't you go steven?  well, there's exactly 5 reasons why i didn't go.    1. I was Confused:  Ok, so i had NOOO idea when it was, like, no idea.  and i didn't feel like asking anyone cause i thought they wouldn't know, and even if they did, i  probably  wouldn't go.   2. By the time i Found out, it was to late: ok, so when i DID find out, it was too late.  Like, i knew i wasn't gonna have anytime to do anything.  The limo's, in all there splender were probably all taken, and even if they weren't, i wasn't gonna pay it all myself.  And all the people that i probably could have had, already had planned out what was gonna happen...and, well, that leads to number 3...  3.  No dates:  Like i said, it was already to late to do anything, cause everyone had already made thier plans, including  dates.  So even if i did go, i would have gone with someone i didn;t really like, which means i wouldn't enjoy myself as much as i know i would.  4. Already going to an   Actual   Prom:  If you didn't know, me and Steph (a freind from antioch, more on her below) are going to her Senior prom.  And unlike the Junior-prommers tonight that have NOTHING to do, my evening on that night is suppose to be awsome..so let's hope...Ya, and because i'm already going to another prom, it leads to my last, and final exuse...  5. Don't wanna spend more cash for nothing:  I gotta pay for a lot of shit dammit!  And my hispanic ass ain't about to go dish out some cash for two things at once, especially if i know one isn't gonna be worth it...but why don't i get a suit like the other guys, and just do it..?  HELL NO, i gotta do my shit right, ok? I go the whole 9 yards when i play dress up, NOTHING is over looked...when u see me, i'm gonna make u say "holy shit", and NOT in a bad way...i ain't about to go wear a fucking 100 dollar suit when i can roll up in a jaw dropping tuxedo.  And shit, i technically wouldn't even be paying for it! My dad will, and he's spent way to Much on my mercedes for me to be asking for more...so THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!   ok, yeah, there you go, those are my reasons.  So instead of going to the prom, i go watch Kill Bill Vol. 2 with David, Rob, Benny, and Robs dad, who drove us...i must say, it was quite the change of the "usuals"...david hardly ever joins us, and Benny is usually with the "d" side of my freinds.  So yeah, pretty cool.  We didn't talk as much..perhaps cause we were soaking in that great film and all, but what ever, good times.  Randomly in the middle of this like, slow, "stalking" kinda scene, this random guy yells "OH DEAR" and the whole damn theater cracks up...very comical.  But yea, nothing special after that.  We sit through ALLLLLLL of the credits, which is like, literally, fucking 20 minutes, and watch the little snipit thats at the end....and it's like, all of 2 seconds....definitly not worth it, but hey, atleast now we can say we saw it...but yeah, here i am, NOT at Prom.  I guess i should just describe what everyone else is doing right now....  Mike V.:  He's at Prom.  He's sharing a limo with Kornhauser, and acouple other people tonight.  He said they got a jacuzzi in there, but i'll belive it when i see it.  He went with emily.  Um, i have no idea what there doing after the prom...prolly just chilling, but thats just a wild guess...  Sabby: Prom.  His date with some chick Natalie came through, so he's happily over there.  I have NO idea what he could be doing, cause he didn't mention it, but he's prolly chillin with the jock crowd, or the WAY-TO-HISPANIC crowd.  Healy: No idea.  He was like the only other person we knew wasn't going to prom, but rob mention he was going somewhere.  No idea where he is...he could be dead for a we know, and we would NEVER KNOW!!! MUAHAHAHAHHAHAA!!!! (...)  Jones: Prom. (?)  Yea, i have a question marl for many-a-reason.  You see, if u didn't know, him and sheel broke up, for good now so i hear, so my, and i'm pretty sure everyone else's thoughts were that he, well, WON'T go to prom.  Well, just the other day, while i mention aloud that he's one of the free guys tonight, he corrects me saying he is, in fact, going!  i immediatly ask who, because i mean, i don't know!  You see, lately, Rob and andreas feel he's separating himself from the "krew"  I whole hartedly diagree, but in any sense, NONE of us really know what he does.  But yeah, he tells us, and it ends up being Katie, of the Nalven Kind.  And let me be the first to say  AWSOME!  I think thats the PERFECT date from him.  Hes always told me how they were freinds, and how she's like the one he can talk to about everything, so off the bat she's awsome, BUT, from all i hear (which isnt bad at all) she's always like, the life of a party, which is awsome!  I think they'll have alot of fun tonight, and even if they don't, SOMETHING is bound to happen.    Jorge: At the Ms's.:  Jore headed over to good ol' Eastchester today.  Here's how the plan was suppose to go down.  He's going up there to see Judith's (thats her name) play at school.  Scott is going too.  (Her and Scott are good freinds, and knew each other before Jorge and her started to go out)  Now, from what i hear, it ends late, and i don't know if thats the reason for this or not, But Jorge is sleeping over!  isn't that awsome?!! O man, this is soo crazy, like, everything were used to is changing! it's a fucking revolution!  Like, jorge was always seen as the "ugly, skinny, shy, self-doubting" guy, but NOW look at him! He's fucking going out on dates, SLEEPING OVER GIRL's HOUSES?!?! i mean, holy shit!! whats going on!? lol, but no, i'm really happy for jorge, i think he needed a loving relationship with someone like he's in right now, so ya, i wish him the best of luck with him and Judith.  Well, anyway, ya, here's probably there right now, doing they "dirty", (haha) but ya, thats where he is.  Hernie: Prom.  I have no idea what he's doing, but from what he told us, he's at the prom too.  Andy: Work.  Andy's handeling his business right now, so i don't think he was going to the prom.  But yeah, he's working right now, and will probably head home soon.  Everyone else: Most likely at Prom.  Giving that i'm tired, i can't really remember everyone else, but i do know their most likely at prom.  *If what i said happend, DIDN't Happen, sorry, i only typed what i heard...*  so yeah, acouple of things happened during typing this..andy got back, and Hernie came only, which means he's home..or atleast, someone is using his s/n.  but yeah, all this talk about prom has got me thinking about the one i'm going to, the one with steph.  Now, here's the thing with steph.  everyone seems to think were gonna go out and shit, but lemme be the first to tell you, i doubt it's gonna happen.  now, don't get me wrong, i love her! she's awsome! she's great! but, i juss don't think she's my type.  And no, it's not physical, so let's not go there.  I mean, i need someone out going, fun, i mena, i juss want someone...i dunno....i acutally don't know what i want.  Maybe i don't know her enough, but i mean, from the looks of it, it's not going to go anywhere past best freinds.  I dunt call her enough anway :d! lol, no, i've called her, but like, only twice, and like, they were on the same day, and both about getting a ride to antioch....so yea, kinda bad.  And from *a little birdy* i think she kinda likes me....which is kinda bad for me.  And i know it's kind of my fault.  You see, when i get confortable around people, i tend to  try  and flirt with every girl.  ANd it's totally subconscience by the way.  So i think i've been doing that alot, which is stupid, considering my position on the whole thing.  Well, i haven't spoken to her in a while, so i'm gonna call her tomarrow.  I was suppose to call her today, but i flat out forgot (like always).  And juss for the record, i'm not scared or anything, if thats what people think, i honestly forget.  Anway, you see, when i dropped off Andy, he told me she got back from her restreat thing, and told me to call her...so i was like, sure, i will.  So i turn on my computer to get the number, check the mail, you know the deal...but then, i start doing the astrology thing, playing video games and shit, and completly forget...then i go to my parents bed, and sleep till like 5:30, when rob calls, saying were going to the movies.  So, then, i was there till almost 11, and here i am now....so yeah, i'll call her tomarrow...i am her date anyway right?? lol, ya, and plus i gotta tell her about my tuxed situation.  So tomarrow will definilty be a talk day.  Well, ok, the time is now 12:15, and i have NOOOO more left in me to type.  All i can say is thnx to dave for letting me borrow his copy of Akira.  I'll watch it as soon as i can.  And, um, thanx to whoever read this whole this.  Well, i'm gonna go off and try to have a Lucid dream...bye bye  (Kill bill Vol 2 was FUCKING AWSOME by the way..you should go see it...)
