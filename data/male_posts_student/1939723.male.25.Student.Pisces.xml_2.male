Maybe I'll put my summer tires on my car now :)  Yesterday we went to one of our many ponds and had a nice afternoon in the sun. Unfortunately the water was still so cold, that only our feet got into the water.   Listening to Moses Pelham's new song "Ein sch√∂ner Tag" would have completed this wonderful day, but it's not yet for sale. One of my favourite tunes for this summer.     Luma    Today I fixed some bugs in  urlLink Luma  and it should be ready for a new release. SASL support is new and lots of the user interface was cleaned up. I'll put up a new tarball on my personal webspace for testing and if no further bugs appear, the next release will be in two to three weeks. This should be enough time for translators to finish their stuff.
