Uncle Patrick was asking the worship team to play some songs that have "Curtis fingerprints" on them. And one of the songs was  Welcome To Our World  by Chris Rice. Curtis seemed to do that song every year for worship around Christmas time...and I heard it about 2 years ago. At first I was struck by how meaningful the simple lyrics were. And then it hit me: CURTIS IS LEAVING. This immense sadness struck me. As the youth director of our church for so long...and the only one I have ever known, Curtis has become almost family to, I'm sure, the entire SFCAC community. I can't believe he's leaving...and how much I'll miss him. He's made a huge impact on my life, in more ways than one. From Sunday School to BAAYF and then to LIFE 2004...he's been all over with us SFCAC youth. I'll miss him. I'm sure everyone else will. I'll miss his Sunday School teaching. I'll miss his stories he recycles for sermons. I'll miss the movies he works into them. I'll miss his jokes that seem to always fit in. I'll miss his advice. But most importantly I'll miss Curtis himself. Gosh I must sound idiotic to miss a guy this much...but if you know Curtis...you'll know what I mean.
