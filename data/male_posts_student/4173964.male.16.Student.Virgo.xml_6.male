Alright so maybe the Mary Jane girls weren't that great of a contribution but still....He will always be the man.  Secondly I guess it reffers to myself. Lately I've just been very off and I think it's because I've been trying to get stuff off my chest but won't because I'm trying to not piss people off. I've decided to stop pussy footing and to say what U want to. If it pisses someone off or offends them in any way they can go fuck themselves.  ...Funny thing is now I can't think of what to say or where to start....  Ok... I'll start with my father. I've been working up the courage to talk about him for awhile now and I guess might as well do it now. Where to begin. I guess I'll do it chronologically so I don't have to go off on tangents.  At age 6 My parents get divorced. My father moves into the house next to my grandparents which happens to also be the house my grandfather grew up in as a child. My dad lives there for 4 years. During this time he meets and impregnates another woman. He eventually moves in with her in a house in the same community as me. He claims it is to be closer to me and my older siblings but in truth I begin to see less and less of him. My step-mother out right says in front of me if she had her way I wouldn't even be in their lives. My half brother is born when I'm 10 and I'm immediately labeled the baby sitter as neither of his parents are willing to put any kind of effort into his upbringing duringthe school year. During summers they pretend they're the perfect parents, taking him to birthday parties and movies and always dragging me along so they can talk with their friends and I watch the kids. At 13 I steal $90 dollars from my step-mother. I am caught and forced to go to couciling with my father. It's all a sham and is provided free by the school board. She's not even a real coucilor but my father is utterly convinced that I am a basket case and could blow up at any minute due to my "cry for help". This coming from the man whole thousands of dollars from my mother and grandfather during the divorce. During that summer my father sets up a bank account for me that he will deposit i think it was 20 dollars a month to prevent me from stealing again. The catch is I have no access to this money. Only he can get to it. I ask him for the money and he blows. An argument ensues (of coarse) and I don't talk to him for the next month and a half. Eventually things are smoothed out and for Christmas I buy him some Yanni cd or something like that. Some new wave shit because he thinks he's sooo deep. A week before we get in to another argument and while he is out I take back the cd. On boxing day he finds out about this from my grandmother (who's probably clinically insane) who also tell him she paid for it. He flips out and says I'm stealing and yadda yadda. On top of this my step mother threatens to phone the police and say they were robbed due to my actions. I tell her to go fuck herself and my father kicks me out of the house. He says completely out of the blue that I was the cause of the divorce and that he's always happier when I'm not around. Since that night we have passed a few letter back and forth. Mostly me asking for my things back and him saying no. I've seen him once or twice and always he's been a cold hearted fucker. I realize I'm not completely innocent and he's not completely at fault. Ya just gotta meet the man and you'll understand. He's never shown the slightest bit of affection to me. I dunno. It's alot bigger than this little paragraph. It's 17 years of bullshit. How do you boil down every little event into this one space? There's a shitload more to it I just don't feel like typing nor do I even feel like telling. Somethings should remain personal. Actually upon re-reading this all these problems seem rather trivial to me. I dunno. Don't all think I'm some kind of pre-madonna who flips at the drop of a hat.  What more can I say about Vanya? I'm just throwing this one out there maybe it wasn't even about me but I'm assuming it was because i'm an overly paranoid freakazoid. I wasn't trying to be creepy and know everything about you or something like that. I just honestly happened upon you blog mcblooger thingy (whatever ya call these things) and didn't mean to offend you in any way by doing that. I wasn't trying to be creepy and I'm sorry if it came off that way. I realize I'm probably still coming off creepy cause I went back. In all honesty I don't know what to say here. I'm sorry if I upset you in any way, shape or form. That was the furthest thing from my intentions. In fact I didn't have any intentions when writting this stuff other than to get it off my chest. I didn't think you would ever read any of my entries nor did i honestly want you to. I realize telling Christine was probably the biggest mistake I could have made. No offence by the way Christine. Whatever I hope ya can forgive me for...whatever it is I did and just put all this weirdness behind us. If there even is any. Maybe i'm just being like I said overly paranoid. but then maybe I'm not. Bu then again, and i truly mean no offence to you in saying this, you are as everyone knows moving to Norway at the end of the month. Do you really think any of this bullshit is gonna matter over there? You probably won't even remember my name. That's not some kind of pessemistic comment towards myself. It's just what happens. Anyhoo I don't know if this really had any point I just thought if it needed throwing out there I'd do it. And if not HEY more weirdness oui?    I dunno what else to write about so I'm just gonna throw myself to the dogs and send this one out.
