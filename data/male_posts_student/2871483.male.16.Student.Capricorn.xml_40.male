Actually, it really wasn't that bad.  -  For anyone who is still confused, I was blue for Spanish Class.  -  Update:  Wei is a G7. Felix is a Bm.  -  I've been stuck doing manual labour at Grandparents' house.  Not so bad.  Get's my arm strength back, and I'm getting paid for it pretty well.  -  After doing the Reading WASL the other day, I have decided to seriously train now.  Not just for track anymore.  I want to run the Boston Marathon when I'm 18.  I'm going to have to train really hard, but it will be so worth it.  -  4.7 seconds, man!
