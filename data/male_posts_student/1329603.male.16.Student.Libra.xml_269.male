BUT (and this is the big smegger) the piece I can play really well and was going to do is actually 4 minutes too short for me to do it. Words cannot describe...  Only got 3 GCSEs left. I am suddenly struck with a deep sense of forboding. Ahhhh. What if I managed to screw up every exam I've done? I've only got 3 left, and so that's a lot to have smegged up. Um... oh dear. I'm sure I've done OK... am I?  I really can't think of that much to blog! Hence me not blogging before. Oh, the experiment is going... well, it isn't. If anything, it's going slower than a snail pulling a supertanker. And supertankers are quite big in comparison to snails.  Also, Lisa is as close to my webdesign idol as any can be. Put simply, she does what I want to be able to do. Basically, her site is accessible easily on my connection, but still looks good. Adam, however, seems to think that all websites should only be acessible for people on broadband, and while his websites look stunning most of the time, I have to say I prefer the ability to actually load a webpage. Well done Lisa.  Quote of the day: "On with the motley, The paste, and the powder. The people pay thee, And want their laugh, you know!"  From   On With the Motley   From Leoncavallo's opera   I.
