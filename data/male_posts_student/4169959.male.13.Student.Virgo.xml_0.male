Shine on you crazy diamond. Now there's a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky. Shine on you crazy diamond. You were caught on the crossfire of childhood and stardom,  blown on the steel breeze. Come on you target for faraway laughter,  come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine! You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon. Shine on you crazy diamond. Threatened by shadows at night, and exposed in the light. Shine on you crazy diamond. Well you wore out your welcome with random precision, rode on the steel breeze. Come on you raver, you seer of visions,  come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!   "Welcome To The Machine"   Welcome my son, welcome to the machine. Where have you been? It's alright we know where you've been. You've been in the pipeline, filling in time,  provided with toys and Scouting for Boys. You bought a guitar to punish your ma, And you didn't like school, and you know you're nobody's fool, So welcome to the machine. Welcome my son, welcome to the machine. What did you dream? It's alright we told you what to dream. You dreamed of a big star, he played a mean guitar, He always ate in the Steak Bar. He loved to drive in his Jaguar. So welcome to the machine.    "Have A Cigar"   Come in here, dear boy, have a cigar.  You're gonna go far, fly high, You're never gonna die, you're gonna make it if you try;they're gonna love you. Well I've always had a deep respect, and I mean that most sincerely. The band is just fantastic, that is really what I think.  Oh by the way, which one's Pink? And did we tell you the name of the game, boy we call it Riding the Gravy Train. We're just knocked out. We heard about the sell out. You gotta get an album out, You owe it to the people. We're so happy we can hardly count. Everybody else is just green, have you seen the chart? It's a helluva start, it could be made into a monster  if we all pull together as a team. And did we tell you the name of the game, boy we call it Riding the Gravy Train.   "Wish You Were Here"   So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain. Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail? A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell? And did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?  Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze? Cold comfort for change? And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage? How I wish, how I wish you were here. We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year, Running over the same old ground.  What have we found? The same old fears. Wish you were here.   "Shine On You Crazy Diamond (VI-IX)"   Nobody knows where you are, how near or how far. Shine on you crazy diamond. Pile on many more layers and I'll be joining you there. Shine on you crazy diamond. And we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph,  sail on the steel breeze. Come on you boy child, you winner and loser,  come on you miner for truth and delusion, and shine   Many people will always say that after a band's greatest album, that the band will never meet their standards from their greatest albums. Many have quit or just gone down hill, but not  Pink Floyd . No, they came back  bit the music business in the ass!   Now the music business music is small, narrow,  arrogant. They don't know anything, but what they want to know  what they want to think.  Wish You Were Here's  two great songs  Welcome To The Machine    Have A Cigar  are both about how impersonal the music business is. They are so impersonal that they tell you what to wear, hear, know, want,  need. Those fucked up old hags were always wrong  they just needed somebody to tell about that  shove it their ass.   Syd Barret  is a very big deal about  Pink Floyd . The band's co-creater  first lead guitarist  lead vocals. The album's songs  Shine On You Carzy Diamond Parts 1-5, Wish You Were Here,  Shine On You Carzy Diamond Parts 6-9  are about the memory of  Syd Barret   how he was forced to leave because of tripping-outs from drug abuse  the future for the band. He was forced to leave, because he wanted to put in saxephones  female back-up singers. -Richard Dasher
