Just click on "settings" then "members" and scroll down. You will see that Stick was obviously invited to join the blog.  2. Pyka loves to talk about how he part-owns the bakery. It is kind of like a cooperative. Sounds rich.  3. I am returning to the Chi around the 16th of August but leaving for Philly around the 20th. I hope that some of you are around so we can kick it wicked haadcore.  4. Clement for Garciaparra? I say: No way, Jose.  5. It's no surprise that Landon's hair is sweet. What is surprising is that I didn't talk about Penn the entire post.  6. (O)(U)(T)(S)  7. Can someone at least mention Graz in their next post? Give him a shout out or something? This blog has gone far too long without a Graz mention.
