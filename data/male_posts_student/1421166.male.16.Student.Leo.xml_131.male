Sometimes we're just full of fervour about things, yet other times, we can't really be bothered with anything else except keeping ourselves alive physically. It is part of our lives and there's no point controlling this 'phenomenon' too much. This 'phenomenon', I would say, is completely natural. But Christianity tells me something else. A Christian should always seek a life full of fervour for God and His work. This, that Christianity suggests, is completely unnatural then? Yes. No doubt it is unnatural. The Christian life cannot be natural, it is supernatural! It is a spiritual life. And I particularly like it in C.S. Lewis' term, the  Zoe.       Oh, life is so full of different phases. Last year, I have dwelled so much into emotions. But this year, I'm somewhere else. I'm in the area of 'practical-ism' and planning for the future. Though I currently stand in this position, I am fully aware that my position is very wrong. This is what life is about. Rongcai calls this the 'ding-dong' philosophy. But in my own words, it would be the 'living law of the oscillating pendulum'. We all know that when a pendulum is set in oscillation, it moves from one end of a certain direction to the very end of the opposite and repeats the sequence with less and less momentum so that it eventually stops in the middle. This theory very much applies to many areas in life. When life begins, we are like pendulums set into an oscillating motion. In life, we seek a perfect life by 'swinging' to different extremes. And each time we try an idea and realise that it fails, we move closer to the perfect life or knowledge. It is simply learning through experience.   Remember Russia? Russian peasant oppression was terrible during the time of Tsarist andaristocratic ruling. People sought to change this. Russians for the people like Lenin lead the Russians in 'swinging' to socialism. And for many years, Russia was under socialist rule. People saw that this ideology for the society was not working and they led yet again another revolt to realise a better Russia, the deocratic Russia we see today. Of course, it is not yet perfect. In fact, not all moving pendulums eventually stops. We need forces like gravity to slow down and stop the pendulum eventually. And in life and culture, this is God's hand.   Yes, as I was saying, I've thought alot more about my future this year. I had to anyway. And here's the news. I would very likely be moving on to the States for my tertiary education next year. It would be New York or Ohio I guess. Of course, things might not go as planned, but this is what is planned. But at the same time, it doesn't mean what I say now doesn't count. You get the point.   To enter an American college, I really need to do well for my SAT I. The problem is not my mathematics, but really the verbal section. So I'd be trying to widen my vocabulary. Strangely, I've been having this interest in Chinese. Sometimes, I feel like it is a calling to Chinese ministry in the future. It seems like a hint, and encouraging me to start preparing now. So, not much time, many subjects, SAT I and an interest in Chinese. Some other things have to go really. But come to think about it, there's not much of anything else to rid except 'nothing'. I meant idleness. Oh, that'll be an easy yet hard task. No more procrastination, that's hard. But actually and factually, I just have to keep myself occupied.       I'm ready to fly    I'm ready to soar    I'm ready to leave this world behind    I'm ready to open up the door    I'm ready to fly    I'm ready to spread my wings    Across the sky     There is something in the future for me. It seems like I've gotten it all sorted out. I see my future. But is it really an oasis in this life of mine? Or is it just a mirage? Will Ifind something different when I'm there?
