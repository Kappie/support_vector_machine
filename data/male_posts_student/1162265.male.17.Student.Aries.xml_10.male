It allowed me access by my computer to all the Baha'i holy books (Their are quite a few), and other important writtings.  It also had the Bible, Apocraphya (spelled that wrong), Letters of Saints and other important writtings.  To make it even better it had four translations of the Qu'ran, and numerous other Islamic writtings.   It is such a great program, I'll post the link for it in my next entry.  I really hope they can add the Zoroaster books, Hindi, Buddhist and maybe some Gnostic books (I guess some of the Jewish writtings are arranged differently, but to my knowledge most of the supplementry works of the Prophets found it's way into the bible).    I found a very interesting bit of knowledge from Abdul'l'Baha in "Some Answered Questions" one of the most interesting religious texts I am sure.  He explains numerous things about his beliefs, and how to logically apply many of the principles.  This quote I am posting is about why newer messengers are sent down, because of religions becoming corrupt, I couldn't help but agree with it.  "Again, consider how much the principles of the religion of Christ have been forgotten, and how many heresies have appeared. For example, Christ forbade revenge and transgression; furthermore, He commanded benevolence and mercy in return for injury and evil. Now reflect: among the Christian nations themselves how many sanguinary wars have taken place, and how much oppression, cruelty, rapacity and bloodthirstiness have occurred! Many of these wars were carried on by command of the Popes. It is then clear and evident that in the passage of time religions become entirely changed and altered. Therefore, they are renewed."  	(Abdu'l-Baha, Some Answered Questions, p. 166)  Wow, it even puts the writter and the page number for you.... That's convient.  I'm still quite iffy on considering converting, I really would need to read more, being the odd Christian I am.    The way I'm talking, it'd seem like I didn't even return from vacation today and did anything in school.  School was quite interesting today, it was perhaps the perfect day, because everything went how it was supposed.  I didn't go to far with anything, or get to bored, it was great.  I guess, perhaps most importantly, getting a 20/20 on the Cotter paper, that I thought sucked made my day, but who knows.  I'm just glad the day went so well, and I was able to crack a joke about the Black History Month Assembly being the most angry one of the year.   I'm such a strange person, I really need to be socially active after 4:00 (especially on a Friday).  I noticed how (crap I'm still talking) I always talk about doing stuff, but never do anything.  I guess I really am a person who is all talk but no movement, which really isn't that much of a suprise to me.
