Not only does it support AIM, it supports ICQ, MSN, Yahoo, IRC, Jabber, Gadu-Gadu, and Zephyr networks as well.   urlLink gAIM  is available on Windows, Macintosh, Linux, Qtopia (Sharp Zaurus and iPaq) operating systems.  It is advertisement free and is fully customizable with many free plugins.  It also has the ability to use @mac.com emails as screen names.  Some of the features include:  * Tabbed IMs * iChat like buddy list * Plugins * Themes * Buddy pounce * IM encryption ( urlLink using plugins with other gAIM users )  I highly recommend gAIM if you are looking for something new in place of AIM or any other instant messaging providers' software.   urlLink It is well worth a download .
