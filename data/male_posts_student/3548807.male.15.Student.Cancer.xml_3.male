( i might have already said this) and when we were on the blanket i just wanted to lie down next to her and hold her hand... but no. then when i was leaving i felt like i had to do something but i couldn;'t do it at the door (lest my dad see us) so i said "thanks for a great time" and i hugged her...but ohh i wanted to hold on forever.  and enough with that...i can't believe it but it was practically my birthday party...they had decorations and everything...and who can forget the wild wild presents!. let's see there's tattoo's. aphrodesia smelling incense, a nurse barbie doll...that doubles as the chick with the eyepatch from kill bill...men's toite underwear...lady's frilly underwear. a cheesy romance book "you, my little fox, will be my mistress". 3 t-shirts, pickle party, eager beaver get's the job done, and the american eagle one that emily got me. and all the great cards!. especially tamsen's "well sam it's been fifteen years and we're still together. Love, Yer Cratch  Sam
