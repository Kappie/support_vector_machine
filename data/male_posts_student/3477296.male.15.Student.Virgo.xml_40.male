Went to dinner right after chem last night so didn't go on the internet. chem as usual was amusing. michael caristo is much better at teaching but as kiz pointed out, scary because he picks people to answer questions. the most amusing thing at chem this week was the prediction that zbaras would say "ill go if you pay for me" in the context of the  yr 10 formal . kiz asked him and he said exactly that...tsk tsk, zebs you cheaparse. *sigh* besides that, chem was a bore for we did not mention the word  wig . >. today has been extremely boring. woke up at 10 --- the  latest  in a long time. spent whole day doing my jap powerpoint when i figured out my completed copy was left at school yesterday --- i  forget  to take out my floppy disk! ARGH!! besides that...the usual boring stuff. my ankle is better now which is good. and we are still very much stumped for what to do on monday. cant go to adro's or stevie's house. jt's house=music day=NO! and so we are stumped. damn shrek isnt out till thursday. *sigh* AGAIN
