And the fact that I didn't really need a website for something that everyone else has. Then again, Quentin DOES rule.  To people reading this:  Most of you know me. To those who don't... My name is JD. That's all you need to know. I also ask for people to refrain from using my real name *leers at them all*. Ahem. Well, as my description says... I DO have a soap opera in the works. It's kinda weird though... Yeah. It'll set around a firehouse. With firefighters and all. In NYC. After 9/11 I suppose. Yeah. It should be pretty cool. Look for that. Oh, and also look for blogs I suppose. Hah. I find that they can be quite humourous. So there's something to look forward too.  'Till then. Z-ya.
