More in the sense of effect inevitably catching up with cause and rears its (in my case)ugly head in one way or another. Serious wake up call tonight/this morning. Still shaken from the experience which was very surreal. So much so that my brain is having a hard time manipulating my fingers to type this...Or was it the handcuffs?...Whatever the reason, I am shaken. Aside from that, all I really feel is stupid and disappointed. This merely affirms my complete lack of good judgment. I don't think the part of my brain that controls anything in the least bit involved with common sense is existent and/or functional. Although the "myopia lobe" seems to be in working order. I can't believe all I was thinking of was if was a vampire that knew kung fu with the ability to shoot lasers out of my eyes .Effing fuck...I'm horny.  p.s. I apologise to all of the zero people who read this blog for its appalling spelling/grammar/tense agreement.
