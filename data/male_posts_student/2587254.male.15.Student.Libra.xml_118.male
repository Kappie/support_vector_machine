I mean back in grade 7, 8, and even 9 everyday after school.....I'd push homework to very last priority and drum, chill, snowboard, or do whatever from 230-9. These days though......life's been a bit more difficult. I mean school I'm trying to gun my average up, and theory.......oh boy dreaded theory. Mrs. Mitsis is going to kill me soon lol. I'm gonna try typing this blog up a bit quickly, as by the minute I'm missing the Colorado Vs. Dallas game for playoffs. NHL playoffs kicked off tonight....and at the moment Colorado is winning 2-0. WHOO! So yeah this blog will hopefully be decent length.  Today like any other Wednesday I woke up at 630 for band. I got decent sleep though.......I actually felt well slept when I woke up at 630am today. Headed downstairs, quickly ate b-fast and then headed out the door for another morning of band. Gr. 10 band seems so easy now ever since I headed up to senior. I can sight read pretty much anything now. I just hate hitting really low notes on t-bone. Today we managed to go through a full repetoire for rehearsal. That's.......new. Lol VERY new. Usually we play through 10 bars and work on those. So I was amazed when we managed to go past 20 bars. NO WAY!  So after a grueling 1 hour band rehearsal.....I head to history class. WWII went by quickly. In a week and a half we are already done the war lol. Covered how Hitler lost the war, and how next day we are going to be starting up the Holocaust. Got propaganda assignment back too.....20.5/21. *Shrug* my marks going up at least =P. Hmm......yeah nothing exciting ever happens in history or civics, especially on band days. Too tired to pay attention.  Civics class I typed up my essay on JFK. What? Do I have to say more? TYPE TYPE TYPE TYPE TYPE. *TAK TAK TAK TAK TAK TAK TAK TAK TAK.* ZzzZzzZzzZzZzzZzzZzzzZzZzZzz.  Lunch time. Today headed out to Galleria. Subway.......haven't had it in a while and it still tastes good =P. Too bad Canadian Subs closed.....that place was actually pretty good. Cheap too.....closed down though wonder why. So ate that....then headed back to school. No homework or anything today too lazy to do any...I'm really tired today.  Math: FINALLY WE START TRIG! I don't get it at all........something about similar triangles and stuff and making lots of lines. Why does trig look so dumb? I have no clue...but it looks really stupid. Pythagorean theorem at its dumbest. I hope Mr. Gilbert doesn't screw up his teaching like last unit....vertical compression and stretch he flipped around. *sigh* You wonder why 3/4 of my class is failing math. I don't blame them....Mr. Gilbert isn't the greatest teacher. He's cool...but he REALLY needs to look over his notes.  Programming........hmm not much. Surfed net mostly today. Turing is getting pretty funny with graphics. My animated dude kinda walks properly. He walks better than Finlan already though. At least he can walk more than 10 centimetres without complaining about being gimped =P.  Badminton practice today.....I REMEMBER WHY I DON'T PLAY SINGLES. I'm HORRIBLE at it lol. Played Pokan today.....got murdered by him 11-4. Ouch. Yes this is why I stick to doubles. We also did badminton conditioning today. We actually did DRILLS. HUH? Yeah I thought badminton was lazy sport apparently they have drills for us too. Strange. But practice was fun. Played a few games....though I'm doing horrible for badminton last few days. Don't know why.....lack of sleep? Maybe.  Bused home then.....got home around 5. From then till 8 I drummed, did theory, ate, and then slept for a bit. Then theory class.  Managed to finish a thing or two.....shweetness =). I'm not as behind as before.  Got home....and did homework. Right now still watching hockey game. Apparently it started at 10pm.....Calgary and Vancouver started at 1030. WHoops so when I turned on TV Avs were already winning 2-0 lol. Right now.....9 minutes left in 2nd. SO yeah this blog took a while to type with procrastination and stuff. So yeah gonna finish watching game then head to sleep. So yeah today......wasn't bad of a day....I mean I got stuff done, and even fit in a short nap. So yeah I'm out for the night. Later.
