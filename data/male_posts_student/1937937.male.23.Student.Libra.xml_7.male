This one is easy: we'll just point out that a bijection between B and B exists, and because B is contained in A, that bijection is also an injection into A.  Since there's an injection from an uncountable set into A, then we know that A must also be uncountable.  Define  f  : B -> A by  f(b) = b .  This is obviously a bijection, and since all  b  in B are also contained in A, this is an injection into A.  Thus, A is also uncountable.    [10/8.2]    Using  urlLink [10/8.1] , we show that if A is uncountable and C is not the empty set, then A  C is uncountable.    All we need to do is demonstrate there is an injection  f  : A -> A  C.  Because we know that C is not the empty set, we let  c  be any element of C by  urlLink the axiom of choice : thus, define  f  : A -> A  C by  f(a) = a  c , and we're done -- this function is obviously an injection.    [10/8.3]    If f : A -> B is surjective and B is uncountable, then so is A.    If there exists a surjective function  f  : A -> B, then there must exist an injective function  f -1   : B -> A.  We'll call this function  g , and define it rigorously by stating that for all a i  in A, the intersection between g(a 1 ) and g(a 2 ) is the empty set if a 1  is not equal to a 2 .  Now, since this function is a well defined injection from B -> A, and B is uncountable, we can now say that A must be uncountable.    [10/8.4]    On the Cardinality of the Power Set    The following is not my work, so it's probably correct.  We're going to look at the power series of a set.  We denote the power series by P(A), where A is any set and P(A) is all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself.  Let us see why there is no surjection from A -> P(A) by looking at the set of positive integers.  Let P(Z + ) be all subsets of Z +  (A such that A is a subset of Z + ).  There is no surjection from Z +  to P(Z + ).  Suppose  g  : Z +  -> P(Z + ).  We show that  g  is not surjective.  For each n an element of Z + ,  g(n)  is a subset of Z + .  Let B be the set of  m  such that  m  is an element of Z +  but not of  g(n) .  We show that B is not in g(Z + ), the image of  g , by the following:   n , our element of Z + , is in B, our subset of Z +  not in  g(n) , if and only if  n  is not in  g(n) ; this is true if and only if  n  is in Z +  and not in  g(n) .  Sounds redundant, but it demonstrates the following:  If B is the subset  g(n 0 )  for some  n 0   in Z + , then  n 0   is not an element of B (our subset of Z + ) if and only if  n 0   is not an element of our function  g(n 0 ) ; however, if  n 0   is not an element of  g(n 0 ) , then it is in B.  This is a contradiction; therefore, P(Z + ) is uncountable.  Now, the reason we discussed  urlLink [10/8.4]  was so that we might discuss a more general proof:    [10/8.5]    For any set A, there does not exist a surjection of A to P(A) = {all subsets of A}    Let define the function  f  : A -> P(A), thus, for each  n  included in A,  f(n)  is a subset of A.  We know that in order for this to be a surjective function, for every element  m  in P(A), there must be a corresponding element  n  in A such that  f(n) = m .  So let the set B indicate all elements  m  such that  m  is contained in A -  f(n) .  Thus, B = A -  f(n) .  We see that  n  is an element of B iff  n  is not an element of  g(n)  iff  n  is an element of A -  g(n) .  But if  g  is surjective, there must be some  n 0   such that B =  g(n 0 ) ; however, in that case,  n 0   can't be in B, but that's iff  n 0   is an element of  g(n 0 ) , in which case  g(n 0 )  = B.  This is a contradiction: thus there is no surjection from A -> P(A).
