So if we did go out and you ended up like hating my guts then you would never have to see me again. If it was a good thing then we would have a nice few months and we would keep in touch. Even though you leaving would suck atleast we tried it out right? Well I wish you would give me atleast a chance, eh? Think about it! Bye. Oh and my parents said the concert would be ok. Yay!
