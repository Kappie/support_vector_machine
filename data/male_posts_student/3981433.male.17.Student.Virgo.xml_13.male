I found out that the school newspaper has been delayed because of a bureaucratic fuck up....this means i've gotta work my nut off reviewing new films, writing articals and copy editing...  ...Great!  plus i've gotta read a bunch of books for A level studies...i need to redo an essay, and do a new one for bloody english too...classical poetry can have a couplet with my arse for all i care... in what exact way is this ever going to be practical?  But on the good side - its summer. time of sun, sand and sea...or sex as the case may be...time for plently of excercise relaxation and a social life.
