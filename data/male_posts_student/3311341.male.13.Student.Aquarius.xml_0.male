I asked if they would take me Circuit city, a while ago... They still haven't. And they said the would take me today, on Monday. So, my "mother" asked if I was expecting them to take me, and I answered her with a "no". She said "Alright."   I then asked her later, and she said "I was basing my decision on whether you had expected me to. So, she gets her way, again. I only have four more years of school(if I drop out, which I need their permission to) so it's a lose-lose situation. *sighs* My dad is slowly progressing on our catacombs... erm, basement. It still looks similar to our septic tank. But, yeah. He's a grouch, and stubborn, and I keep offering to help, and he tells me "Stop picking on my stuff. Go away." He's starting to get annoying. I'm not sure if I would rather be independent, instead of living in this family. It's pretty much the same business.  I'm not sure if I want a portable dvd player, still. I have a ton of money that I could go buy one. BUT, the one I wanted went up by $130. I'm extremely disappointed. So, now I could probably buy a car... Lol. But I'm not old enough to drive it. I don't know anybody anymore. Not even God. I've drifted away from life itself. And I'm pretty much depressed. Neopets has taken a huge chunk of my life away. And I'd rather be engulfed in that, rather then the life of my family. I hate it all.
