It's been a while since I've blogged, but then I haven't had much to blog about...seems like I can't compare to the amount of blogging Rei and Shu have put into it...*looks around* o.o' Oh well, I hope to have a new design up soon and I am currently working on something for Jade  and  Rei-chan. ^-^ I doubt I'll get it done before the school year starts though...*pouts*...    As to my comments towards the blackout, I too found it an interesting experiance...well, if I had  flashlights  it may have been a bit more interesting...^-^; But oh well, otherwise I think it really woke people up to how dependant we are on it....hm...    Well, seems like I'm stumped out of words and I don't have much left to write...o.o' er...so..yeah...*looks around* *curses and dissapears*
