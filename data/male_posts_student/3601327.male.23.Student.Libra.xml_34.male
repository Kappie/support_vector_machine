Basically, there are lots of folks who go sans clothes at places like the Verde Hot Springs.  At the time of the debate, I didnt really mind the nudists at Verde and I still dont.  The subject stirred and incredible amount of controversy      I was just thinking to myself the other day what a perspective changer it is to be over here in Germany.  There are naked people everywhere.  No one seems to care or even really notice for that matter.  It's just part of the deal.  I guess I kinda feel sorry for the folks that experience a gut wrenching feeling when ever they see someone naked.  I wonder if it is a big deal to you????    I am going to try to post the picture of a fairly typical billboard from over here.  I would also like some opinions on that.
