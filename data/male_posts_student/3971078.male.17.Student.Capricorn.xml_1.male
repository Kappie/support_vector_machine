This is going to be what seems to be more the mature way of writing, i.e. observations: Thoughts about what's around me, but not about me.  So I'm talking things such as  there seemed to be a lot of good-looking girls in Derby today. Perhaps it's just because it's a gorgeous day and the weather's rubbing off on the ladies, or just making them wear as little as possible while still maintaining a touch of dignity. - I didn't think Derby was particularly notorious for it's attractive women-folk.     Speaking of Derby, I saw an interesting notice outside a church, something along the lines of  "Half the world's worry is caused by trying to make decisions when not enough information is known to make the decisions."  It made me think a little more than the usual crap on the front of churches, yet it does seem just a little bit presumptious...  __________  Something that made me chuckle yesterday, and seems to increasingly so is the amount of archived camera footage on the news (BBC is what I'm talking about, but I'd guess it's the same, if not more so, on other networks):   "Fifteen people were killed in Iraq today in fighting between multinational forces and armed rebels. A helicopter was shot down..."  *Cue (what I can only assume to be an) archive shot of an apache flying.*  But this wasn't the example which really made me laugh. There was better in the summary in the closing seconds:   "The Bank of England has raised interest rates by a quarter of a percent."  (That's right, right?) And whilst this was being said it just showed a clip of a highstreet. I guess there's not really much you can show for a story like that, but still, it did make me chortle.  These examples clearly aren't as good (bad?) as what happened a couple of years ago when Fox had some story or other involving the New York skyline, and the current skyline miraculously still had the WTC sticking up like... a sore thumb (or something a little more obscene)?
