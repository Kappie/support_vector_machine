FLCL  stands for  Film Language Critique League , but the people who made the name for the club took the initials from an anime series (FuriKuri). Basically, the club meets every other week to watch and discuss a different film. So far, we have watched   urlLink THX 1138  ,   urlLink Amelie  ,   urlLink Dr. Strangelove  , and currently,  urlLink  Grave of the Fireflies  . Mostly, the same seven or so people come to the club on a regular basis, but lately we have been growing. I know, I'm a dork for being in a film club, but the club allows me to see movies that I wouldn't normally get to see, and I have become increasingly interested in filmmaking.   I will now post the links to the movies that I have recently seen, both inside and outside the club, under the "now playing" section of my sidebar. Plus, as you may have already noticed, I am putting a different movie quote at the top of my blog each week.
