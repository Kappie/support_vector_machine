I really don't want her to be bitter at me, and I'm trying my best not to be bitter with her. Things are hard these days. Everyone has been telling me they're worried about me, they're saying all these nice things about fate and thigns. I don't believe in fate. I don't believe in the fact that there is only one person for everyone. She says she's moved on, and honestly, I'm doing my best. There are things she did that nobody will ever be able to replace, but it's not the end of the world, it's not the end of my life, either. I've decided I need some time to be single, just do whatever. Find out what I need.  I was listening to my Bailey's Car CD today, and I heard a song that almost moved me to tears. I'm not sure why. Here's the lyrics.    Away From You  © 2002 Bailey's Car Written by Cam Stephens   It's not your fault,  It's what they've made you  That makes you unattractive to me  I'm not willing to commit what you want  To give up what you want me to.   You were my life I found myself in you  But now it's time to say goodbye It's time I found out who I am  Away from you.   It was fun while it lasted  But now I don't love you like I did before  Two hands full with one fist was too much  All or nothing you said  Well nothing.   I will always carry the memories  You were more to me than you know.  Regrets, I may have some  But sooner or later  We'd be at this point again....     Yeah. That's that.  Anyway, Crystal. I know you have me blocked. I'm sorry you felt you needed to do that. I would love to talk to you, if you're willing to talk to me, that is. Tell your mom I say hello and pat your dog on the head for me.
