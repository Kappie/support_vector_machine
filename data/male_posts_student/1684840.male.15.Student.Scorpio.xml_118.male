I couldn't go to James' Barbeque because it felt right to go and see my Nan because I haven't seen her for ages.  The drive there was tiring.  The sickness I get from travelling is terrible.  It leaves me nauseated for a while afterwards.  At Grandma's we had a big dinner with trifle and cake afterwards!  I had two helpings of trifle then couldn't eat another thing when the cake came :(  Had a fun time with everyone and the day went quite well.  I got some fudge from when Grandma and Grandad went down to Cornwall... YUMM!  (It was gone within minutes of opening it at home).  I've been playing the new Avril Lavigne album over and over again because it's so great!  I got it about 2 days ago and ever since I've been engrossed in the cool music.  I'm about to go to bed now because I'm being picked up at 11am to be taken to Stoke again to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and the Odeon and have a McDonalds... EUGH!  I suppose on fat-filled food won't harm me, unless I have one of the new crap McDonalds salads (their desperate fight against the health scientists out there saying McDonalds is crap).  They will probably cost a bomb anyway due to their exclusiveness.  What a big step from those tiny little fruit bags in the Happy Meals hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha... *cough*  Anyways, better get off to bed.
