If you haven't already inferred, someone got caught copying my work.  The worst thing about it all was that the person that caught the copycat was the Maths Dean. Anyone in 3.16 would know that the maths dean can be one hell of a bitch. Oh yes... Did I mention that she was a close friend of my mother's? Well I was relieved when my maths teacher told me I was "almost" called up, which meant that I wasn't called up. But what happened was even worst. The Maths Dean made a personal call to my mom, telling her to "keep a closer eye on him." Oh... And you know what she told my mom? "He was involved in a copying case." Wow! That's specific enough... My mom actually thought I copied in my maths test, cause I was struggling with a question the day before. And I'll bet she'll get suspiscious should my results come out perfect.  What a bitch... I really should get my maths teacher to clear this matter up. Call my mom then... Tell her that I'm getting my work copied instead of me copying... Now that will solve everything, cause she won't really care if I get As for everything while the rest of my class fails... HEHE!
