People talk about how the film suggests that a few seconds within a 20 minute time span can have massive reprucussions. I think it also suggests that events in reality have a chaotic nature as well, specifically in the realm of human emotion. For example Lola and her father's emotions varied dramatically, that is in the first "part" her father doesn't give a shit about Lola, yet in the third "part" they have a touching moment in the ambulance. Essentially what I'm talking about the trajectory of human events and how the course is erratic. Like Marx says in the 18th Brumaire, "Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please."  I think I'm all packed except for toothpaste and razors for NY. The change of scenary will be nice.  ***
