No one is going to learn anything about religion in a classroom that will matter in their lives. Anyhow, today's topic was focusing on war and religion. Specifically the conflicts between Israel/Palestine and between Islam and civilization.   The format was to have students present a topic, give their views, and then we discuss it in a orderly fashion. Order was maintained, but sometimes rather poorly. I of course am the 400 lb. gorilla in the room, with cogent and well-articulated views on all things.   The first presenter painted a picture of the Palestinians as poor, oppressed victims and the Israelis as modern fascist oppressors. I took umbrage and informed the class that the Palestinian's plight is a result of their fellow Muslims refusing to open their countries and take them in. Countries like Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, etc. Instead they fuel the hatred at an "unjust" situation. I also remarked that this situation is voluntary because they could just stop fighting and join all their fellow arabs already living as full citizens of Israel. Those pearls of wisdom were met with disbelief and suspicion. The professors in charge of the class did acknoledge the truth of my claims, but they forwarded the position that "the cycle of violence has to stop." I did not get an opportunity to offer my solution to the cycle: allow total victory for one side and total defeat for the other. It is the only way to truly end any conflict.   After this were a trio of women presenting. They talked about religions motivating people to kill other people. Kamizaze, Timothy McVeigh, and suicide bombings/ 911 were discussed. We focused mainly on what can justify killing and specifically why the USA is hated around the world. All 3 of the women had foreign accents, and one said she was from "another country." The general consensus of the class was that America was evil, we had no business being the world's policeman, and that we were wrong to try to force our values and society on other peoples. They asked the class if any of us had something, some idea that we would die for. Amid the chuckles, my voice could be heard: "For my country." After further chuckles and head-shaking I amended my statement: "Well, maybe not for some of YOU, but I would for my country."   We all moved along right over that little outburst. It did make me realize that I would die for my idealized country. Until I said it, it wasn't real for me. But now I am fully aware that the idea of America is worth dying for.   From there we moved into discussing Iraq. In general, the class members remarked that it was unjustified, and that we were being bullies and oppressing people around the world. A Lebanese woman told us that the opinion of the US in her country of origin was that of a selfish, greedy thug. I almost went insane at that instant. I didn't get a chance to inform her that if we were truly greedy and thuggish, that she would know it in an instant.   I put the professoress in her place though. She tried to play the game of moral justification with us. "Why did we go into Iraq and not Rwanda?" I fired back: "So you're saying that unless we can help everyone we should help no one?" She said then "But it seems we only invaded Iraq to help ourselves. If there wasn't oil there we wouldn't be there."   "So what? Gas prices are only going up. If it was for oil then why aren't we getting oil cheaper? Besides, it only makes sense for us to help where we gain something by doing so. Helping with only gain for one side is worse than helping people and gaining benefit from it. The Iraqis are better off now than they were under Saddam. We're better off now than we were before the invasion."   "But how are we going to get out of this? How can we put an end to it?" This is a paraphrase unfortunately. I don't remember her comment at this point.   "To answer that, I might be saying something offensive but its the truth: We colonize them. We force them to conform to our values and that way we can leave."   At this point the subject was changed by some classmate. But I know I was right. Unfortunately, most of those present sided with the professor. They remained convinced that America was bad, our motives suspect, and that suicide bombers are justified because they are defying our oppression.   An atheist Jew classmate, who talks with me occasionally, summed it up best: "What a bunch of f-ing idiots."
