Well, I have a prayer request for all the Christians out there, but it needs to be unspoken for now. It's a thing at school that's testing my faith. The song I use for encouragement and direction is SCC's "Bring It On." The chorus is inspiring! I have the lyrics and a link to hear it after the signature.  Oh, and in Spanish, there was a nasty old casserole with onions and stuff in the back of the room but we couldn't smell it because it was air-tight. The class decided to open it in the hallway. It smelled! So they put it in ther trash can out in the hallway. It smelled so nasty! Mr. Medley was laughing away: "Ba-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!" as loud as can be. When school was dismissed, everyone smelled it, and moaned and covered their mouths with their shirts... It was sooo funny!!!  Anyway, blog ya later!  In Christ, Mike >    Bring It On  :  urlLink Hear this song!   I didn't come lookin' for trouble And I don't want to fight needlessly But I'm not gonna hide in a bubble If trouble comes for me I can feel my heart beating faster I can tell something's coming down But if it's gonna make me grow stronger  Then bring it on! Let the lightning flash, let the thunder roll, let the storm winds blow Bring it on! Let the trouble come, let the hard rain fall, let it make me strong Bring it on!  Now, maybe you're thinkin' I'm crazy And maybe I need to explain some things 'Cause I know I've got an enemy waiting Who wants to bring me pain But what he never seems to remember What he means for evil God works for good So I will not retreat or surrender  Now, I don't want to sound like some hero 'Cause it's God alone that my hope is in But I'm not gonna run from the very things That would drive me closer to Him So bring it on!  Bring it on! Let the lightning flash, let the thunder roll, let the storm winds blow Bring it on! Let the trouble come, let it make me fall on the One who's strong Bring it on! Let the lightning flash, let the thunder roll, let the storm winds blow Bring it on! Let me be made weak so I'll know the strength of the One who's strong Bring it on! Bring it on!  -"Bring It On" by Steven Curtis Chapman, from  Declaration
