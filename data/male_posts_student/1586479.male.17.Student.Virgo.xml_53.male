But it would be in Java. Which sucks. It's possible to write a program in Java and compile it into a Cocoa application (for Max OS X, which I wish to eventually code for), but I read that doing so isn't so great. They are slow (thanks the freaking JVM memory hogging), cumbersome, and rather confusing (because some commands work, and some don't). AAAARRRRGGGHHHH! I want to learn Objective-C in class! Ideally learn it using Xcode (Apple's development utilities), but since CCDS is completely anti-mac, that's extremely unlikely. Guess I'll have to learn it on my own. But then there also aren't any books that teach objective-c as applied to Xcode. grrrrrr....  Ugh, the geekiness.
