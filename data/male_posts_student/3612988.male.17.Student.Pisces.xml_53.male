NDP days. Soccer. raping. joking. stripping. SEC 2-7.all sorts of rubbish we did together.  haha i din cry cause got girl girl beside me. how can throw face right?haha tim though cried. his face was really wet lor. i think the school really meant alot to him. to me. to everyone who graduated from year 2003.          catholic high....thank....
