I have this assload of homework, I can't wait til soccer practice and this weekend's state cup although we are playing a national league team first and I'm starting, of course. School is biting my ass I am going to fuck around so much this summer and have so much damn fun you cannot imagine. Fuck school and all it represents, but what does it really represent except a dark hole of depression and anger for everyone who has ever been there. I dont think I'm getting a yearbook because I dont care about our hell hole of a school. So many of these fucks that run around all day being hyper or sad or whatever the fuck, and well yeah. I think I might get bored this summer (notice how I just changed my mind in a matter of 30 seconds) wow I am just ranting arent I. So in conclusion I quit life for the second time in a minute.
