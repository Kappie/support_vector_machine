Advice I would give to a friend in my shoes would be that every moment that you live, you are learning and therefore redefining who you are and where you’re headed. I would say what you want in life now will evolve, so just go with the flow. However, that doesn’t solve the problem of my future near and far being so devoid of clearly identifiable objects.   I feel so displaced; I don’t know where I belong physically, intellectually, and emotionally. I have no sense of home, I have no idea about my career, and I don’t know how I feel about life in general. Nothing is bad, but nothing is good either. It’s an annoying feeling.  The only thing in my future that I’m pretty sure about is that I’ll get my phd; however, what does that mean? Will I find a job? If I do where will I live? And what does this mean for my relationships with friends and family? What will all this mean to me as an individual?   I’ve gone on rants about trying to figure out who I am before, so I’ll leave it to the archives to do all the work. Something different about how I’m feeling right now is this concern for my current liminality and the prospect that it’ll never go away. I remember when I visited my cousin Kathy and her husband Eric and their friends talked about the nature of academia. Things like moving around a lot, long distance relationships, money issues, politics and career decisions scare the shit out of me.   I don’t like thinking that I won’t have a sense of home until I get tenure somewhere, which might not even be a place amenable to my personality. I don’t like thinking that it’ll become harder and harder to hang out with close friends. I don’t like thinking that my love life past, present, and future would be very different if I chose a field that didn’t have me all over the place. I don’t like thinking that I will have to play political games to ensure financial and career stability.  It’s the potential of things not really changing, and me never escaping the confines of my rut.   **
