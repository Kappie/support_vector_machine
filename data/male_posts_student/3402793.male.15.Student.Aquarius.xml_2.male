You're probably wondering about it, and don't worry, it does make sense. While doing a creative writing for English, my friend Alex, the girl with a poet's soul, wrote one of the best things I've ever heard, but it had no title. So, I gave it the title "(untitled...thus far.)" This turned out to be a new era for my life. Those three little words and ellipses soon began to title nearly everything that was in association with my life. I know you are probably thinking I'm a freak, and I am. I don't care though. So many people think odd things of me, and I'm used to it. I am an active member of the National FFA Organization, and am going to nationals for the Parlimentary Procedure competition. Yeah, well, I'm really boring. As for me, I am 15, and live in Oxford, CT. My name is Pat, and I go to school at the Ellis Clark Regional Agri-Science and Technology Center. Well, now you know me, or so you may think. Take these next words as you will, for they may bring joy, sorrow, anger, or no emotion at all.  "Embrace the end as a beginning, and the beginning as an end, then your life will follow it's true course, and end up where you don't want it to go."
