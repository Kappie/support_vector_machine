I talked to him for a second, then got confused because i was actually TALLER than him, and left.  Second, in about an hour and 10 minutes, it'll be my birthday. Whoopee. I haven't even planned for it, and only Alex said "happy birthday." Thanks again.  Ooh, so guess what? Bush has decided to go back to the moon! Wheee!  Uhh... this will help us... how?!?! I bet he's gonna ask for money to do it quicker. The jackass. I hope he dies.  In fact, here's a list of some people lately who I really think need to die.  -Orlando Bloom(he's a white nerd just like me, but he is rich and has more fans. what gives?)  -Ashton Kutcher(The man-whore, he's filming a really serious movie, but it will be impossible to get into it because he looks so f@(#ing goofy all the time!)  John Ritter.  Oh, wait.    (P.S. i just said that about john ritter because i needed the name of a dead guy for that joke to work. I love john ritter, I think he's a badass.)
