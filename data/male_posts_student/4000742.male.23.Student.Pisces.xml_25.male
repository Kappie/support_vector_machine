Today was the Final, featuring hostels 3  4 on the one side (that is our side, I am in hostel 3) and hostels 11 12 on the other. We ultimately lost 1-0 in an extremely closely contested match, although the second half was very much dominated by the opposing team. Some of the players in all the teams are really good and can make up a reasonably good institute team. However, we don't participate in any inter-institution or inter-college sports meet, so the talent remains confined to this campus.
