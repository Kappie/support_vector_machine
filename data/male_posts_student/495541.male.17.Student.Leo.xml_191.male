No wait..  right.  On a serious note... mosquietos suck.  Literally.  What's interesting about them, from my research is that only the female mosquetos suck your blood.  Interesting, I guess.  Further proof that women suck... (thahahhah... pun intended).  Other research points out that there's over 2500 different species of mosquitoes around the world.  But only around 200 of those are in the US.  If you didn't know... these motha truckas look like this:    But another interesting fact is that they have their own magazine.  It's called "Wing Beat."  Funny eh?  Right.  So most of the time I'm playing basetball.  Like this weekend, just today we went up to Iowa City West and played a few scrimmages.  And tomorrow, we're going to Cornell for a tournament.  Should be cool, I think.  We'll see.  I am listening to: "Clocks" by Coldplay
