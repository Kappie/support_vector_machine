When he got released he decided that he needed to dedicate himself to finding a lawyer and getting out of his situation.  This he decided would take a couple days a week for the rest of the semester so he dropped all his tues and thurs classes (yet another bad decision).  THen he just sat around on his ass and watched TV and slept untill Sat night when he decided to go out and get hammered again and Walk home from the Hawk (What an Idiot).  Ohh well I guess some people never learn but as for me I have been sick but I did manage to buy my sister Toby Keith tickets for her birthday (there went 100$) and I slept and tried to get well.  Right now I'm off to take a picture of the damamge JP did so I can send it to everyone so they can all witness the destruction first hand...  I will leave you now with some words of hope... "when the gunsmoke settles, we'll sing a victory tune and all meet back at the local saloon"  Well at least it's hopeful to me..  Let the love of Willie Nelson grow in all your hearts...
