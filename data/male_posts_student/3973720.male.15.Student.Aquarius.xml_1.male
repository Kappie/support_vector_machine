I wrote two poems for her called, The Prayer, and Before You...She said she liked them but who knows maybe she is just being a girlfriend...But I truly think she is the one for me...One day I said i love you to her...and my hole world changed...i look at life diffrent, she is always on mind or i am talking about her....jus ask around to see what I mean...I am so happy that it bothers me sometimes...and for once i have everything i asked for in a girl...But know I am the most happiest perosn in the entire world becuase I am with Tiffany!!!!!!!!!! :D
