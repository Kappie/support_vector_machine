Put in 2 nickels, and found out someone lowered the credit intake to two nickels (10 cents for 3 stages, mmmm). Anyways, best DDR night of my life... I passed Ska A Go Go, Kamukei, Tsugaru, Tsugaru Apple Mix, Saints Go Marching In, and Orion 78 Amero Mix on heavy (9 footers).  My cata count is now up to 8. Sweetness.  Catas passed: Break Down Dead End Ska A Go Go Kamukei Tsugaru Tsugaru Apple Mix Saints Go Marching In Orion 78 Amero Mix  10 footer passed Bag Sakura  All in 7 months.  Shit, thats good.
