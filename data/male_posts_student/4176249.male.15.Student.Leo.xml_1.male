I think that this can go many ways. I *do* believe however, that this is truthful. As I mentioned before, our will to love, and to to survive, is an energy that keeps us as we are now, and in this form. After we die, this energy is combined into something known as a spirit, and waits for it's own time to reattach itself to this world of the physical once again. When this happens, all that is needed, is a form of life. This form of life can be anything. A tree, an insect, or even the air we breathe. All these are the most likely selections for the spirit, because most spirits are not powerful enough to become an embodiment. The only way to become a human once again, is to lay dorment inside of the early stages of a human child, at the exact moment that a soul would be selected to rest inside of it. However, this requires a powerful, and very wise soul. Once this is done, the child is born, and they grow into an adult. One of my very best friends was talking about people becoming elementals, meaning they obtain the power of one of the seven elements. These Elements are known as Air, Water, Home, Fire, Soul, Story and Sound. I believe this may very well be that best way to go about this. One might obtain an element, by being the reincarnation of a very powerful and wise spirit, whose life was lost to one of the elements. As such, a person who dies in a plane crash, might be bound to the skies as a spirit. If they are a weaker spirit, they might become an eagle, or a falcon. But if the soul is stronger, they might actually become the wind itself, creating jetstreams in the vast and endless skies in their own honor, until it is time to become a human child once again. This child would then become very in tune with the element of wind, and would make the best of pilots, or perhaps a great astronomer. On another note, someone whose life was lost to a terrible lie, or took a beautiful story to the grave with them, might be reincarnated into a beautiful wirter, or perhaps a famous inventor, as a Story elemental. You see? Anyone or anything around you could be the reincarnate form of someone who was lost to this world long ago, or even yesterday, and has returned to the world of the living once again, to claim a spot in life for themselves.....
