I do care about you people ya know It upsets me off to see part of the group unhappy with the rest of the group It seems all the people that really aren't involved in whatever the fuck kind of conflict this is, I don't know, nobody has even really told me about it yet, I don't want to know anyways.. oh yeah I was in the middle of a sentence, my bad.. It seems all the people that are not involved in this feud are the people that want it settled the most You guys should take care of it, if not for your sake, for  ours
