Spying the upside down American Flag and the black and red Anarchist Flag that I had sewn onto my shirt, he told me to "get a job and trash your fucking chaos." Well, I would have stayed and debated politics with him, but I didn't feel like being arrested, so I ran. It seems that the American public has a very skewed view of Anarchist theory. Well, though I doubt the angry truck driver will read this, I hope this will clear up many people's misperceptions about Anarchy.     1) What is Anarchy?     First of all, to all those Hot Topic idiots out there with your coroporation-made Anarchy t-shirts, you're gonna be dissapointed. Anarchy is not chaos and destruction, it is not Nihilistic. Anarchy is a peaceful political philosophy based on the belief that human kind, being social animals, does not need to be ruled to function properly, and that government only serves to widen the schism between rich and poor and to make life chaotic. An Anarchist society would be a peaceful, autonomous and (most likely) small collective, which makes decisions in a purely democratic way, by the popular vote. No one's actions would be discouraged unless they were harmful to others. Property would be publicly owned, and economic barriers would be removed. Instead of a boss making production decisions, the workers would collectively make these choices. There are no police, because since all property is public, there is be no reason to steal or to kill. People would be encouraged to find ways of dealing with personal disputes on their own, but if neccessary, a public meeting is held and the matter is resolved through the popular vote. (Please keep in mind that this is very brief, and there are many different ways an Anarchist society can be structured. If you are interested, the internet has countless resources on this subject, a good starting point would be  urlLink infoshop.org  or  urlLink flag.blackened.net .)   2) But aren't Anarchists violent and brutal at  protests?   That depends whether or not you think that property destruction is violence. We Anarchists do not believe that the elimination of corporate brainwash in an attempt for peace can be considered violence or brutality. And as far as hurting innocent civilians at rallies and protests, I think you will find that it is the police (the tools of the State) who are responsible for the injuries of civilians due to the use of pepper spray, rubber bullets, billy clubs, tear gas, and tasers. Most people fail to realize that Anarchists are responsible for many peacful orginizations, such as "Food not Bombs", and "Schools not Jails".   3) Wouldn't an Anarchist society be a breeding ground for a  militant government takeover?  It is true that early human history saw the development of government, not for protection but to steal resources from more peaceful societies. However, we feel confident that such a hostile takeover would not be aloud in a modern anarchist society because human society is much more complex and human beings have become socially superior to the early man. Because of public ownership, it would be very unnecessarry to steal from another community, as one would merely need to ask and what could be spared would be gladly given him or her.  Well, I hope this sufficiently cleared up at least some of your misperceptions. If you have any questions you can research them at the websites listed above which also contain a great resource of anarchist/radical links, or you can email me @  urlLink X_AugustSpies_X@hotmail.com    Smash the State!
