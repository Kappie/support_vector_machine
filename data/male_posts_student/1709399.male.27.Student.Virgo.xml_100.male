But during my visit last week , I was really glad to be amidst the warm sultry weather of madras which was a great contrast to the Gloomy Cold Delhi . They say things are relative in life. One never appreciates things until he has seen the worst or the other side of the coin.                                 Madras is at its best in Nov/Dec/Jan . The Weather is wonderful  the air vibrates of Music  religion culminating in the Carnatic music season  maargazhi utsavams  Bhajans. Tourists flock the city for the music concerts which creates a Vibrant ambience that is Intellectually  culturally stimulating. The choice of Artistes  concerts during the season is mind-boggling. Oh gosh..I really miss being in Chennai.
