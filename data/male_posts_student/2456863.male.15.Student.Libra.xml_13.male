Speaking of hayward, if anyone's ever been to the candy shop there it is VERY good!! ah i remember that one time when we were at the cabin and boomer started chasing the ducks down the shore and he was like 500 yards away before we caught him.  He loves the water.  but he hasn't figured out how to jump in yet.  lol.  if he's sitting on the dock and you throw something for him, he runs to the beach, then swims out for it.  Its hilarious!  anyway i'm goin to spencer school forrest in like half an hour to go skiing with my dad and boomboom.  So see you guys at winter carnival then.
