Today we visited  The World of Coca-Cola , a museum that houses an unparalleled collection of over 1000 memorabilia tracing the rich heritage and global reach of the world's most popular soft drink. We were really quite amused to find that Pinoy's represent at Coke - a Coca-Cola Philippine jeepney was on exhibit in the International Gallery. Knowing that it would make for excellent blog material, I made my poor husband take on  the squat pose  in front of the jeepney to up the truly pinoy factor (much to his dismay).  Another interesting aspect of the tour was the opportunity for guests to sample various Coca-Cola products sold in foreign markets and not available in North America. My favorites were the apple flavored soda sold in China and the lychee flavor one sold in Thailand. I certainly won't be rushing out to stock up on the bitter tasting soda sold in Italy. And in case you're wondering there wasn't an adobo flavored soda from the Philippines. But you'll be happy to know that Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines Inc. is one of the largest Coca-Cola bottlers in the world and employs more than 19,000 Filipinos.  Mabuhay Coca-Cola - truly fobilicious!
