You know, just the usual stuff Trotta and I do, trying on suits at Brooks Brothers (he picked suits out for me that would look good on me and I did the same for him), looking at all the new shirts that the Polo store offered, sharing a pretzel, and had a wonderful discussion regarding women.    It was totally like a Sex and the City episode.  Good times.
