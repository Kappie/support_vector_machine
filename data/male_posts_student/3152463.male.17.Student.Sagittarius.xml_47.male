The package was *very* well packed; two layers of bubble wrap, two plastic bags, two Jiffyâ„¢ bags, and yards of duck tape featured heavily ... Plus a 'Buddist-clipart' sodden 'thank you' note ... with a PS - 'Please leave positive feedback' (Hmmm ... [But only if I leave them feedback, will they provide me with positive words of praise, they say] )
