I love you more than anything and you know it.  You should know it by now, at least.  I love you.        I woke up and I was with you.  That, quite possibly, is the greatest thing in the world to me.  I woke up and you wrapped your arms around me.  I could die in that moment, darling, you mean everything to me.        Since my last real depressing post, that I wish I would have never written, not much has happened.  But... I'll fill you in, anyway.        Me and Brice watched  Shattered Glass , which turned out to be really good, and  Igby Goes Down .  The latter was a poor attempt to exploit Salinger's classic,  The Catcher in the Rye , but it was a good movie, none the less.  I liked it.        We saw THE bug that night, and decided to sleep upstairs.  You would have, too.  Trust me.     I told my love I would come to her house early... well, I overslept.  I overslept alot.  It's all good though, she still loves me, I'm sure of it.        I spent a few hours with her, then I drove to Pomeroy and ate with Jamin and John-Pat at Pizza Hut.  I always have a good time when I'm with them, we can talk music, politics, and life.  It's all good with the Riley's.  (Don't get me wrong, Jamin, you're still pretty gay)      Then, I drove home and talked to my parents for a few minutes, got a shower, and lied to them.  I told them I was staying at my cabin.  We both knew that's  really  not where I was going to stay.  Oh well, they can get over it.        I got to stay allnight with the one person who holds my heart in her hands.        We stayed up nearly half the night, then we woke up at six.  I woke up a few more times until I left, each time staring at the love I held in my arms.  I thanked God for you, I felt your skin against mine.  You're a blessing.  I'm in love with you.       The damn cleaning lady came 45 minutes early, so I guess our little secret is out.  You say, it's alright, so I'm going to believe you.        I took Brice to get a hair cut and then we went and picked Jamin up and ate at Dairy Queen.  Now, I'm killing time until I can see Jami again.        I'm out for now people, I love you all.  Wait, no... I don't.  :)      Keep cool my babies.
