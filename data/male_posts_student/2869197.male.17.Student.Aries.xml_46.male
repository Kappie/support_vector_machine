I just hope I can continue reading it after June 1 (the return date) because it shan't be finished by this time.  Another delightful trip to Mr. Givinetti. I really ought to write down all the stories of this man's life. They are so numerous and witty and insightful, but, alas, I am lazy, slothful even. Perhaps another day.
