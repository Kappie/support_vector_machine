It bothered me in how Bush used words like terror(ism), freedom, economic liberalism, etc. His words reminded me of this poem: Take up the White Man's burden-- In patience to abide, To veil the threat of terror And check the show of pride; By open speech and simple, An hundred times made plain, To seek another's profit And work another's gain. It's no wonder people say this was a urlLink  colonial war . I was telling some friends last night that it sucks that a vote for Kerry won't necessarily change this foreign policy. We're stuck dealing with Iraq, and it'll loom over American international politics for a long time.  I went out for a jog and lifted weights this morning, but I was fatigued for some reason. I think it might be due to a week of crappy eating.  ***
