Zider's office to tickle Carla and then she goes," Whoa I didn't think I would see you here today." and when she was walking off she goes its good to see you again. and gave me a hug. I wanted to say " Well.. I wish I could say the same about you." (HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA). But Brandi I think the best reason for today was to to see your pretty little face. Could have lived without the smartass attitude but.... I'm just playing you know thats what I love about you. Well I'm going to sleep so talk to you tomorrow. Love Ya much.
