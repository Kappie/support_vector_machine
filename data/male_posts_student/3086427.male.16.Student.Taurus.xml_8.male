With this,it finally goes off for printing.                            Preface    Here’s a quiz book whose time has come - India’s heritage, looked at quizzically by a young enthusiast, fired by a sense of discovery.    As it happens, this was the subject of my very first quiz book, Inquizitive, published way back in 1989. And as I noted then, this is an area where there’s so much more waiting to be discovered, full of questions waiting to be asked, and answered.    Indian heritage can be a slippery area to the seeker of facts. With all the claims and counterclaims of conflicting histories, and disturbing tendencies to prefer myths and legends to proven histories, truth can be a big casualty. And what are facts but truth, and what’s quizzing, if its not about facts ?  So, it’s terrific that Akash Bansal ,an accomplished quizzer on the schools circuit, with a winning track record in heritage quizzing, were prompted by Principal Shyama Chona to write his own quiz book. He waded into the challenge, went beyond the bland over-simplifications of prevailing textbooks, scoured through tomes and volumes in  libraries, and trawled through the net, to come up with a sizeable set of questions, covering various facets of India’s heritage, in a variety of question formats.    Over the years, DPS, RK Puram has earned for itself a reputation for the excellence of its quizzers. Its an outcome of the sort of commendable pro-active support that they’ve extended to the student authors of this book.   This book of questions should whet the appetite of the curious, to find out how much they know, tell them about things they did not know about, test what the book tells them, and encourage them to find out more, for themselves.  In all these years of conducting quizzes, I’ve found that the key to the right answer is the right question. Well, here’s a bunch of probing questions, to set you off on a discovery of India.
