Aside from my self-admiration, this is the update for tonight.  I don’t have much to say tonight but I do want to say I had a good day today.  It was interesting.  It felt good to go home and not have anything to do as far as homework and stuff.  I got it all done in school.  I really like that feeling and hope to keep up in my work so I don’t have to do much homework at home.  I don’t know exactly how all my time disappeared this afternoon and tonight.  I guess a lot of it just disappears because of TV.  I remember Moran telling about how he challenged his other class to go without technology for a week.  I think I might like to do something like that for fun to see how much extra time I have.  But right now I think I’m going to go take a shower and clean my room.  It’s pretty messy from the trip back.  I emptied my backpack all over the floor.  The following is a picture from my recent trip to California.     Night.
