He goes to everywhere, meet nice people, the Tv chanel gives him the best clothes, pays the best hotels, and he doesn't even choose the place he wants to go. This world is so unfair, I'll have to work for about 2 or 3 years to get less than 5 thousand dollars, and the guy travels and gets tons of money.   I just got back from gym - i took shower, don't worry- and is so funny see the peoeple's face, HAuHAuHAuHAuHAu... they bite their tongues, close their eyes, get red, and some guys breath, out and loud...What people do for get beautifull for the society is wierd.  A doubt is killing me: what is the plural of human being? It could be human beings, but being is the verb Be in gerundy, and it could be humans, but the plural of man is men, the pronounce does not change. Hummmmmm........ Why am i waisting my time? :$
