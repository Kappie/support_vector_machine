Damn, I really shouldn't have gotten myself into that...  Anyway, here's a short summary what's been happening today: I practiced the guitar, I woke up really late, I watch Wimbledon final, found out my friend is a liar (It was harmless, don't worry), and will be pruning the trees in the yard today. I also have to catch a bus, ride a train, and walk to a RadioShack to buy some batteries and some adapter cables. I am so stupid for not having brought those from LA.  Long-ass post to come about everything over the past few days in detail tonight. I bet it will top a couple thousand words.  That is all. -- Feanor
