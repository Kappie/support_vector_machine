The recordings were from 12 August when the Liberal and Labour parties were about to agree to a guillotine motion on debating the Marriage Amendment Bill before it was passed*. This meant that the Bill would be debated for only 3 and a half hours. Given that there were 19+ speakers, this was clearly not enough time, and the time that was available had already been allocated to multiple Second Reading Speeches by those in favour of the Bill. Basically, opposition to the Bill would not be heard at all.   [Greens' Senator Nettle's speech on the matter can be downloaded  here .]  Even more distressing, this farce of a democratic process occured  after  it was decided -by the Labour party- that the formation of a Senate Committee Inquiry set up to report on the substantive issues of the Bill, both legal and social, was required before the Bill was re-entered to Parliament. That Committee had finished recieving public submissions on the 30th July, and was working on its report at the time of this debate. The guillotine motion made the Committee's actions utterly moot, and I can only assume that it was abandoned.  The Democrats and the Greens were outraged. I was absolutely LIVID. My initial shock at the government's move to legislate against same-sex marriage (even before the issue was in motion among the greater gay and lesbian community in Australia) had been lessened when Labour decided the matter should be debated more fully by the creation of the Senate Committe Inquiry. I saw it as my chance to participate in the democratic process, and submitted a 7,000 word legal research paper arguing against such legislation on the grounds that the maintenance of such a conservative satus quo, in any jurisdiction, was possible only where basic human rights were not adequately protected, as is the case in Australia. This mitigated the ability of lesbians and gay men to appeal to any binding legal principles.   Given the extraordinary  prima facie  presumption in favour of basic human rights, such as equality, by liberal minded people (and this is, supposedly, a liberal democracy), this is a real problem. The situation begs the questions: is anything that is legal therefore morally defensible, and is anything that is not enshrined in the law necessarily unworthy of our consideration?  So in the face of the Committee, and therefore my participation, being ignored, I sent my submission directly to Mark Latham and John Howard. The following note preceeded it:   Dear Mr Latham/Mr Howard,  It is difficult for me to describe the feeling of being so completely, deliberately, and unnecessarily silenced in the sham of a democratic process that led to the passing of the Marriage Amendment Bill. I therefore submit to you the document I had submitted to the Senate Inquiry you, in your arrogance, decided was not worthwhile. Please read it - you cannot pretend that you don't need to listen to gay and lesbian complaints against the Australian political and legal system and still believe you adequately represent all Australians.  I urge you to respect the differing opinions of the thousands who took the time to be involved in the democratic process of the Committee and read some other submissions received by the Committee that you have also ignored.  Sincerely, James R K Griffiths    * Full Hansard of debates on the 12th August is available  here  if you wish to read everything that was said on the matter. If you have never used a Hansard document before I will soon be adding a "How To" section on that very matter, but in brief, approach the body text with the search function in Acrobat Reader, Word, or your browser (depending on the format you choose to download), looking for, in this case, "Marriage Amendment". Don't just start reading it and hope to come across what you're looking for; individual Hansard documents are hundreds of pages long and most of it will bore you to tears and possible apoplexy ... in this case the debate begins on page 26,105, which is page 167 of the pdf you will be able to download. WARNING TO GAY MARRIAGE SUPPORTERS: I suggest any controlled breathing technique to remain calm while reading this document.
