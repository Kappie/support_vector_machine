Anyways just gives me more reason to look forward to tomorrows, or does it? I haven't decided the task yet and it can't be too big because I'm working 9-6 :-(. So what to do, what to do, what to do???????? Check it out:          The Fifth Task          Tomorrow I will making a campaign poster for Nadia to win Big Brother 5, I will have between the hours 7 and 8 to complete this task. The campaign poster will be displayed in my bedroom window! And I'll also put it on this for you guys!          TTFN, James
