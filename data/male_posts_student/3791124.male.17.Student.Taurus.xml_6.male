It's about Ragnarok Online, which is a MMORPG (Massive Multiplay Online Role-Playing Game), and covers pretty much every aspect of the game. Or at least it will, once it is officially finished and launched.          I'm leaving for S. Carolina tomorrow for a week. I'm verbalizing my blatant disapproval of the choice of  where  it is we're going, but I'm secretly anticipating it. It's not too far from Myrtle Beach, and... I would say I'll go to the clubs there, but it just won't happen. What's the appeal of a club anyway? Incoherent, sweaty bodies having the sensations of their life. I don't belong there. Looks like baking in the sun on the beach is where I'll be.
