Yup, the wondering is done. It was a nice day. It was a 9.5 of 10. It was great. Windy breeze,not alone, and most of all school stress free. My ex came over and we hung out watched a movie. Itwas nice, it was calm, it was good. I guess, well, um, I dunno. He saw his entry in my phonebook. I think he was shocked. I named him:  The 1 that hurts . But hey, I'm guessing. He got on the bus around 9 P.M. We had a cool time, you know. Hanging out, chillen. Went to KFC and we went to see my pal Christina who works at Papa Johns! (If you see her there, just say AJ sent you and annoy her like hell!) Lucky her she only works Friday and Saturday. I think she was a little ovewhelmed and shocked to see me. It was good though.   Here's the log song,  Drop In the Ocean  .    "Love took me by the hand Love took me by surprise Love led me to you And love opened up my eyes  And I was drifting away like a drop in the ocean And now I realize that  nothing has been as beautiful As when I saw heaven's skies In your eyes In your eyes  And every time I drift away I lose myself in you And now I see I can be me In everything I do  'Cause I was feeling as small as a drop in the ocean And now I realize that nothing has been as beautiful As when I saw heaven's skies In your eyes In your eyes  Love took me by the hand Love took me by surprise  And I was drifting away  like a drop in the ocean And now I've realized that nothing has been as beautiful As when I saw heaven's skies In your eyes In your eyes"    *iT waS A GreAT StarT 4 aN EvEnTFuL 3 DaY WeEkeND*
