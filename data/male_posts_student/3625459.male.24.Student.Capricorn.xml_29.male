I grab my phone to see what time it is and to see if shes called or sent a text, though deep inside i do know the answer. The times roughly what i think it is  atleast i know when its 7o clock, 9'o clock or whatever the time might be. Lie in bed knowingthat she asleep, probably dreaming and getting much needed rest.   They say that loves something thats suposed to make you feel happy. All the forms of love that i've had have never given me happiness. " There no one there to catch you when you fall, It's survival in the city - Eagles".   It aint easy trying to forget sone one you care about, as much as i want to forget and move on i find it difficult to do so     Joel: Why do I fall in love with every woman I see that shows me the least bit of attention?   I couldnt have asked for a better  movie in my life at the time i watched it.
