I actually feel physically sick at the thought of knowing I'm not gonna see her for the next few days. It's kind of odd too because with past girlfriends I would be really angry at the thought of her being in another country sharing a room with a friend who happens to be a guy but I can honestly say I trust Mandy and know I have nothing to worry about. People are probably wondering why I am saying stuff like this after quite a short time? Well, I've never had feelings so intense for anyone so soon before. And I know what I feel. I can't wait until Friday morning because I get to see her again. I'm probably gonna spend most of this week sleeping or keeping myself busy so I don't upset myself too much. Wow... I have an emotional side...
