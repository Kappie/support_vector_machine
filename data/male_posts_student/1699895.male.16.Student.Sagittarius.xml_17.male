ITS AWESOME!! I won't say anything in case you haven't seen it yet, but it is highly suggested that you should go.    I saw it at noon today and got home at 3:30, and slept till 6....I'm still in daze mode, but I can still type =).  I think I'm goin go run out and purchase some things for my printer, something I was supposed to do yesterday, but since I'm just a big fat shit, I slept some more! lol. so I'll see you all later!
