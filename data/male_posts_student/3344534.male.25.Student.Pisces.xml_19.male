Bells On , Sloan  While I'm at this funeral  You're in New York  I've been dividing my grieving  You're sleeping with a mutual friend   I dreamed that I kissed your mouth  And you thought about me  Over Christmas  Oh, you might know who I am  But I know who you are  Your heart is in your art  And mine's in New York   I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve  You're sleeping with a mutual friend  And I want to be with you again  And again  And again  I've thought about you a lot lately  So flash me your metal smile   I'm thinking about you  You're thinking about  New York  Though to you your friend was hurt  To him I owe him money  Will you pay back the thirty dollars  That he thinks I owe him?  But I don't owe him anything   If you had a funeral  I'd be there with bells on  La la la la la...   If I had a funeral  Would you even care?  Would you wear your silver dress?  Would you actually wear lipstick?  Would you lie upon my grave?  And be there with bells on  So you could ring me from this life?  From this life  From this life  So you could ring me from this life  people of the sky  is i think one of the few andrew songs that's on my favs list... and it's on this album.  as sloan has progressed... i think andrew songs have become more wordy and annoying.  hey... aug 7th @ 1pm... sloan playing "hot august night" concert on olympic island in toronto with a couple other bands.  $40.50 CDN includes ferry ride over to the toronto islands from the harbourfront.  ok i'm out.
