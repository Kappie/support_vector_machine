Today I went out and bought myself some speakers for my CD player, Â£20.00, not too bad. I don't know why I write on here, I already have a diary, on...err...what's it called again...? Oh yes. Paper. Very quaint. Authentic too. So..other things to say... I'm listening to my Monty Python CD, track 10 'I'm So Worried' - genius song. I'm just waffling now, so I'll shut up.
