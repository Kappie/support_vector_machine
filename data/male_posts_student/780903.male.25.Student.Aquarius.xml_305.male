I think the point is to make us see that legal arguments -- like optical illusions -- can be framed in different ways, and that our job as lawyers is to fraem our legal issue in the way most favorable to our side.  So the judge sees the young lady instead of the old woman.  Actually, if the justification we get us in class tomorrow makes even half as much sense as that, I'd be surprised.  Instead, I'm expecting to hear something like, "yeah, we had you look at optical illusions because we want you to see that sometimes things aren't clear.  Like the law.  Yeah.  That's it.  See you next week."
