Coz 30 mins before I crashed into the pillow I was thinking that it has been a while since I met my advisor, a trepid thought creeped in and said if I don't stay in touch often enough with him that might significantly affect his reco letter. Its this guilt feeling that manifested in the form of a streak of light underneath his closed door.      Who were the people who scared me in the lab ?    The guy who offered me a ride who appeared familiar to me was one of my frnz, a couple of days ago aided by a bit (??) of intoxication we were talking like crazy and both of us were sharing a joke with an african american lady. At that time I was thinking that I shouldn't be doing this and probably I had carried on this feeling for a couple of days.      Who and why were the guys skating in the hallway ?    Whenever I go to the CS dept labs I find a group of people haranguing when instead they should be busy with their assignments and stuff like that. At their sight I always felt that they were having a smooth time in the grad school while I was slogging (self-pity maybe!).      Why that fast food joint in the hallway ?    The sight of the fast food joint seemed so similar to the one me and my frnz used to hang out oftentimes in my undergrad days. since I hit the bed hungry, the place where I used to devour delicious food made an appearance in the dream.      Why PR and that gorgeous woman ?    My frnd PR had called me and I did not return the call yet. But why that girl and why him fliriting I don't know. She was Konkani, but why Konkani ? I guess that evening I was reading a debate about influences of Sanskrit on Dravidan languages but I remember the article was talking about Kanada, Tamil and Telugu not about Konkani.      Why am I making a furor over a mere dream ?    Coz this is one of the dreams for which I can concretely attribute events that occured in the past few days and its really surprising that many a days when I have tried to make sense of a dream I was almost always unable to explain certain mental images.
