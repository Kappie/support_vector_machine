But I got ice cream cake and presents, so I was pleased. In other news, Lance Armstrong is still winning the Tour de France!  This, of course, is of international importance - well, it ought to be.  And a hurricane is going through Texas - I think its name is Claudette.  I'm still somewhat befuddled as to why we *name* our hurricanes, so if someone would care to explain it? I also got an email from one of my best friends earlier today saying something about  1984 , the book by George Orwell, and it's relation to society today.  I've never read the book, but the comparisons were interesting.  It was talking about making English *perfect*, aka politically correct.  It brought up the way textbooks are being written today, and how information can be parceled out in just such a way as to paint a completely inaccurate picture about the way things were.  I'm not sure I understand why this would be done . . .well, on a logical level, maybe, but . . .I don't know.  Later.
