I guess it's all good, I don't really want to go anywhere tonight anyway. I am in one of those,  keep to myself  moods. I never get much of those because I am so outgoing, but it's nice to have a break from all the wildness.  My day went good today. The hospital visit went awesome, it was good to see everyone I worked with this past semester. I am currently working on a schedule to volunteer there with some kids. I loved the placement so it'll be no sweat getting my community hours in order to graduate :)  Work also went well today, was fairly busy until around 6:30, when the call volume dropped considerably. So I sat around talking to some buddies at work, all "computer" talk. I swear, this guy I work with is so smart with computers, he makes me seem like an idiot. He's so talented at his web design and what not. He also designs computer games so I agreed to be a beta tester for one of his games. I am looking forward to doing that :)  I am still pondering whether or not I still like my ex-girlfriend. It seems like the connection is still there between us, but I am not sure, and I am not jumping to any conclusions because I don't want any hurt done. I would prefer to get to know her better once again. I don't know whether or not I will be able to commit to it though. I love the whole relationship thing, but I want to figure out if I want  this  relationship or if I want to seek out someone else.  Life can be so confusing at times. I try to be optimistic about it, however. I guess it's like a test though, and a challenging one I might add. I am just thankful that my life has turned out as good as it has. (As I see it) I feel for so many people in this world, and it's sad. I feel almost selfish at times because I have it so good, living in Canada and what not. There are people out there without a roof, without rights, and it's not right at all. I then shift to my perspective  "Everything happens for a reason"  and the whole  fate  ordeal. All of the shit that goes on this world must happen for a reason, life is a test. A test of how well you cope with certain things, and how you act in certain situations.  Fuck, I vent a lot, eh? I swear this journal is an asset to me. Even if I had nobody read it, I would still feel better deep down because I got my thoughts out. I am so intellectual now, unlike my previous self. I am done with the normal teenage attitude on things. I can't help it anyway; if I feel more mature than I used to,  then all the power to me.   I love the outlook I have anyway. I just wish others could see life from my perspective. I suppose it's neither positive, nor negative. It's just a perspective. Neutral. Mediocre. The way it should be.  Well that's my piece for now.  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site   Talk to you all later.
