That's about it ^^   Addendum: that's odd... for some reason, my blog post keeps disappearing after awhile... =\ i have to re-publish it. In other news, thx sis for the card! ^^ wow... so much effort, it is much appreciated! ^^   Addendum: yay gift from keane is a rabbit inside glass ^^ cool! looks pretty =P   ~Chronos
