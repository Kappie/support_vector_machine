You have to spend the entire weekend fixing it and yet STILL lose your web page...grrr soo well while I was fixing I did some optimization so that once everything is back in order you guys (should) see some speed increases (oh god I hope so)   pictures will be back proxy may be back when I get some time (I'm gonna customize it ^_^ ) yes I'm geeky enough to know some Perl and the documents I had on here...Well maybe depends on whether my history teacher really  wanted to see them that badly
