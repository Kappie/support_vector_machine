It's a 3 bedroom so we best get crackin'. She's staying here for a few days because I don't feel like being alone right now. Her boyfriend Saul is at this studio making a sculpture for the balcony outside my room. I have piles of paperwork to fill out. I'm applying to Yale, Brown, Cornell, Dartmouth, Columbia, Harvard, PENN, Stanford. It would be idea if I got into Columbia so I can stay in New York.
