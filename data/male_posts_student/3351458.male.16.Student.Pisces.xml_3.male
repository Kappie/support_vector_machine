Dad's half-Malay half-Chinese, Mum's full Chinese...guess that makes me three-quarters Chinese,  eh ? So, I guess it's understandable why so many Malay people raise their eyebrows when they hear my name. " Hah? Itu jer? Tak der Mohamad kat depan ke? " Sweet.  I'm 16, born in Ipoh on the 16th of March 1988. Can't speak a damn word of Malay...well, can  lar , but damn lousy. Used to speak Cantonese well, but now...can understand but don't want to speak for fear of making mistakes. Used to speak Hokkien well, but now...can understand but don't want to speak for fear of making myself look like an idiot. So, perhaps now anyone reading this blog will understand why a perfectly normal Malay guy is using English...  Studied in Sri Lanka for a period of three years. Two of those years were horrible years in which I grew fat, had lots of problems with girl classmates who were obsessed with the Spice Girls, but managed to learn how to swim, do lots of tricks in the water, learn the initially boring but interesting cricket game and improve my English and experience life as a House Captain. The last year there was definitely the most memorable one, where I spoiled my eyes completely by reading a whole stack of novels in near complete darkness every night, grew even fatter but managed to become Head Boy.  It was those years which has shaped me the way I am today. Mostly blur. Partly blind. Still quite fat. Can't kick a football straight. Have a poor command of the Malay language.   And that's all you need to know about me.  That's who Khael is.......
