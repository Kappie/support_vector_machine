Shower of Sparkles  Upon the break of dawn on the day of the thirteenth birthday of Gwendolyn Elena Welch, the ecstatic youngster leapt out of bed and ran down the stairs shouting "YIPPEEEEEEE". This woke up her family, the pets, and possibly a neighbor or two. Gwen, as she was called, barged into her older brother's room, ripped the blankets off of him, and pulled him out of his bed. Her brother was a tall lanky boy with brown hair and blue eyes. He usually had a weird sort of half smile on his face, and he was a very friendly, yet somewhat shy boy. Gwen wasn't very much like her brother at all. She had blond hair and brown eyes. Gwen was very outgoing unlike her brother. They were both very friendly and kind, though. "Hey, what'd ya do that for?" asked her brother Philip. "Don't ya know...? It's my birthday!" exclaimed Gwen. "That's NO reason to yank a guy out of a really good dream," replied Philip. Gwen answered him saying, "But, this isn't just  any  birthday. This is my  thirteenth  birthday." "Good for you, wanna cookie or somethin'?" Philip responded. Starting to become frustrated, Gwen asked, "Don't you remember...?" "Remember what," said Philip. "Your promise! The one you made when I turned nine and you were fourteen. You told me that when I turned thirteen you would take me on a hike through the woods to the key keeper's cave to search for the secret passageway to the lake," stated Gwen putting emphasis on the words 'you' and 'your'. "Okay, okay...hold your horses...we've got all day" he said. "But you said we would make sure to get an early start..." "We'll leave at eight. Deal?" "Deal." Gwen left, but not soon enough. Her dad was stomping down the hall in anger and she happened to bump into him on her way out of her Philip's room. "What is the meaning of this, young lady," shouted Mr. Welch. "Huh?...What'd I do?" "You were shouting way too loud! Tweezer started yelping and your mother was frightened half to death," yelled the furious father. "Ya know what, I'll let you off the hook THIS time, but only because it's your birthday, but don't go around screaming like that this early in the morning anymore" he said after calming down a bit. "It wasn't that loud..." she muttered under her breath. Her father didn't hear her, which was a good thing for her because if he had then she could forget the adventure with Philip. She later realized that it would be unpleasant to wake up to someone shouting like that so she apologized and was forgiven. Gwen then went and celebrated quietly the beginning of the day by herself while fixing a bowl of cereal for breakfast. Philip had gone back to sleep, as well as Gwen's parents. Tweezer, her dog, started incessantly barking at something outside. Tweezer was a young yellow lab who was very friendly, and rarely barked at anything. Then, there was a knock at the door. Tweezer was usually very friendly with strangers, so his barking at a person seemed very odd.  Who would knock on the door this early in the morning, and why would tweezer bark so much , Gwen thought.
