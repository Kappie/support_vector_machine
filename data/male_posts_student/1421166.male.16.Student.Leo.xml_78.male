Well, I hope I am. Cause I just realised that I'm pretty much not having all the fun that I should be having.  It's been quite boring these days. Not that I have nothing to do, but I really just feel like getting out of the house and hangout. Though the fact, is that there won't be anyone to hangout with. Only strange thing that everybody else is probably at home thinking about the  smae thing. Either way, Singapore is so small! Where can I go? At least there's YF tomorrow. So I can like take the chance to get out of the house a little. Only problem, that I now realise that I only have 8 days to prepare something to be done next Saturday! Arrr!!! Oh no...I'm really not in the mood to sit down and think these days. In fact, I think I'm trying hard not to be so indoors all the time. Why can't I be like really out going. Think that would be much more fun. OK...hope my old school friends would call up soon and decide on a day to hangout. (not to forget that it had better be on my free day, I haven't managed to join them for any since we left primary school)  Tried bowling a few days ago. Kinda cool. Although I lost the second game terribly with only 56 points. But I guess it's like that if you don't really play the game. Maybe I can go play bowling sometime again. (though my hand still hurts from the previous game) So, my class won third placing Inter-class Basketball Tournament. And guess what, I was in the team, when I didn't even touch the ball. Cause I lent my  PE attire to someone, so I didn't play. But who cares, at least I get a medal. *hehe*  Recently, I noticed too, that there are so many of my friends about my age with all the MSN nicks about love and stuff like that. Example: 'Loving you...it make me happy.'  and 'cos the way I feel when we're together, I know that's the way, I'll always feel for you...' Even my little sister typed something about love used to being everything. Thus, my hypothesis is that this is common in adolescents! (oops...I just declared it upon myself too.) But it's just real I mean, although someone already said it before I did, I never thought it would be so real. But it can be sweet, especially scenarios on TV. Wait...what am I saying! Well, you see, it's real. I mean it gets into me too.*blushes* Oh well, who cares...it'll be over...right? *hmm...*  Cool, this is getting a bit more sixteen year old. Make things sound so much interesting. I remembered this song sung by Mandy Moore called '17'. If only I had enough talent to write my own called '15 turning 16' But don't think I would be able to. I even gave up guitar without really trying.I have little perseverance. Maybe I should just stick with my clarinet. Then one day, I shall start a music revolution with classical crossovers to more pop, and maybe even rock!*haha* Impossible at my current pace.  Ok...I should go. I've got lots to do. Even though exams are over, I shan't be too lazy.
