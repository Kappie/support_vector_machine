Here, you shall read rants and raves about 'dem dum-dums who either are 'fraidy of dogs, plain dum-dum, idiotic, or just overly illiterate that they shouldn't be in charge of businesses or public places.  Also contained in this blog will be posts about our daily lives, links to the ADA, service dog sites, and any dog related websites.  and we shall begin with a quote...  "People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion." - Albert Einstein
