In big casebooks.  Enough to fill up a library.  Or so the reasoning must go.  This is just background so the song makes sense:  "Langdell Reading Room" (to the tune of “Margaritaville”)  Started on Monday That was a fun day  Signed into Lexis and found me a case  But then I saw her I couldn’t ignore her And spent all the day staring right into space  Wasting away again in Langdell Reading Room  Searching for the thesis statement to write Some people claim that there's a woman to blame  And there is  And she’s a librarian  I came back on Tuesday  A gave-me-the-blues-day  Because my librarian wasn’t around   She's a real beauty  A researchin’ cutie Finds all of the cases that need to be found   Wasting away again in Langdell Reading Room  Searching for the Supreme Court case to cite Some people claim that there's a woman to blame  And there is  And she’s a librarian  I saw her on Friday Yeah, that would my day I needed her help and she came to my aid  Wearing that short skirt And I looked down her shirt I wasn’t to get any work done all day 	 Wasting away again in Langdell Reading Room  And now I’ve got just three hours to write Some people claim that there's a woman to blame  And there is  And she’s a librarian  Some people claim that she don’t even know my name... And she don’t Cause she’s just the librarian….
