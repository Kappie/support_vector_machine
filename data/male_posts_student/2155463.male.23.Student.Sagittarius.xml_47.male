I think that stifling joy kills it, and repressing anguish leads to melancholy, and I think that one can only really appreciate these feelings by sharing them with others.  I mean, I don't have anyone to express my pure emotions with - it just seems like there isn't anyone who I'm close enough to (or who wants to be close enough to me) that I can actually go and tell them how I feel.  Albeit, for the most part this would probably mean expressing my seemingly perpetual doubts and fears, but every once in a while I have something happen where it just seems so wrong to have no one to share it with, to have no one who will be just as happy about my joy as I am.  And I think that these times when I am at my lowest or at my highest are when my deepest injuries are inflicted - not in the normal sense where someone inflicts them upon you, but in the simple absence of anyone else to share the experience with, someone to validate the experience as real.  I think that it is these times which have inflicted my pervasive sense of loneliness, a sense only punctuated by brief periods of belonging which come along ever-so-infrequentl
