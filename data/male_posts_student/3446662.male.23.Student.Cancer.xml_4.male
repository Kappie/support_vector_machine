As my ex boss say, i am easily distracted from my goals and objective... and that is pretty true this few days.. i am pretty affect by this lost of th usage of my left leg.. and it is hampering any effort to study for exam..  wow one sem is almost over...somwtime i wonder man, what is wrong to have a relationship from someone with a different religion or same sex.. in the last couple of months i have discovered from observation, that love is Really blind, love sometime cannot go beyond religion, marchim like the story River Between, where Wahyaki of old tribal religion falls in love with numbura, of christian convert  Is there really no space for extremes to become mormality?... can we just like what we do in statistic, whenever we have a skew left or right curve, we just log it to look symmetry?..  what is wrong with this freaky ...  anyway just wanna say that the Doctor taht attended to me, Dr Anne-Mary, was a very nice Doc, who went all out to explain things to me and also reassure me that things are not that bad..... i'll give a 9/10 for professionism  as for the exams.. dont wish me luck.. i dont want it i want hard work to paid thru.
