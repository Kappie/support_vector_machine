I am really starting to get worried about my move - my BIG up and coming life change. One way or another, I will pull it off, but it is an unknown adventure that could crush me.  I didn't have enough to eat this morning, that will adversly affect my workout - I will be a big pile of ooze when I'm through. MiMi is off work today, I am gonna go home at lunch and hang out with her for a while. It's cloudy atleast and that makes for a pleasent break from the heat that I will have to just get used to for the next few months.  I havn't read a book since I got back from Cancun - I'm sorta pissed about that. Again, it's one of those things that no one can do anything about but me. There are several books that I would love to jump into - it just seems like I spend my free time cooking, cleaning, and stareing at some sorta screen.  I feel like a zombie - it's time to stop the EVIL cycle. This happens to me every summer - I just don't like to go out for a walk as much as I do in the winter. To me there is nothing inspiring about summer. Winter has this magic about it that makes me think and feel more positive.   This is a re-occuring topic for me, I apologize.  I was hoping to get the bump today but I found out that it looks like it will be a couple of days. bummer. I really need to either get my money back from the bank or get my paycheck so I can pay my rent. UGHH!
