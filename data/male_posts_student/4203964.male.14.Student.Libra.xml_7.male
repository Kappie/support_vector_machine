I guess the most exciting thing that happened today was when a kid from my neighborhood thought he was being attacked by a snapping turtle while swimming in the lake today. It turns out that there was no turtle which meant that there was no reason for him to run out of the water yelling. Yeah. Today was pretty dull. I did manage to figure out that my boat's engine needs new spark plugs. I sat there wondering why it wasn't starting for like 10 min. Yup. I sure hope everyone else's days were more exciting than mine.  Joke of the day: What happens if you throw a red ball into a blue lake?  (I sure hope that tyou are intelligent to get this one cause i wasnt)  It gets wet!!    yeah it was that sort of day. I invite anyone who has something interesting to share with me to please do so. Sorry for not entertaining you. SJD
