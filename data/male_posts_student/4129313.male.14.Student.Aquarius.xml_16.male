First period was boring as usual, nothin much to talk about. Second period I read my book the whole time, but I heard on the very brief announcements, the words "Photoshop" "Illustrator" "Dreamweaver" "F10" and "After school" so I asked the teacher to read me back just that one part after the speaker was done rambling, and got a bit of the scoop. So I went down to F10 afterschool to see what it was all about, and some tall dude pointed towards the door and told me to get the fuck out. I was all like "WTF?" so I tryed to say something, and before I could get a word out he repeated himself, wich I think is VERY annoying, and tryed to say something about it, and before I could say anything else he started yelling at me for not getting out. So I slamed the fucking door just before I called him a stupid ass fucktard, and went home.  Fourth period was exactly the same as always: Teacher bitchin, students talkin, Teacher bitchin bout talkin students, I should have done summerschool or something. Next time I'm doing PE in summerschool. Only five weaks, and since its so hot durring the summer the state would say we can't do much outside so we'd spend the 5 weaks in the gym shootin hoops or something.  Fifth period was extremely hot, so we had to go inside again to play Bball, so I'm very relieved that I didn't have to do the stadium bit, but I know it'll come one of these days.  Lunch I had another salad, and a coke. Now I have to pay back my friend Raul for the coke.  Sixth period I finished my final draft of the sentances I had to write. I think I'm pickin up german prety quick.  Back to school night is tonight at 6, I'm not sure if I'll go or not. I still want a notebook computer so I can blog at school and stuff. If your willing to buy me one email me at my gmail account ;)
