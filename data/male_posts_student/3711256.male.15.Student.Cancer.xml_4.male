That's the only big thing going on right now, but enough whining!   Okay, so I was actually starting to get a pretty good tan going, but for those of you who know me, I'm very white and lose tans quickly. So for these first few days of summer, I was spending my whole day outside. Then it goes and gets cloudy, and I lose 2 weeks of sunburns in 2 days. Great.   Okay, sorry, that was more whining. So my whole thing today was just whining. Aw geez, I'm still whining! Alrighty, I'd better leave while I still have some self esteem. As before, expect more tomorrow.
