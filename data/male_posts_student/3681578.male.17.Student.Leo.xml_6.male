Doc Mara (the dearest ancient wizard on the magic of numbers and functions) gave us homework...which, humility aside, I found quite easy... I still have to prepare for the dreaded July 5 though, the day when first stringent test in his field of numerology will happen...I do mean prepare...  2. Mark Cayanan (our witch-like warlock on the literature) gave us two stories to read plus a reading on the plot for monday...he even hinted on the possibility of having a surprise quiz...  and still more ka-OC-han on my other subjects...
