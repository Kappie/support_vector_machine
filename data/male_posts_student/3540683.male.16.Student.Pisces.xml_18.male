To you bitching at my poor writing - You write at 3 AM you jackass. To you bitching at me being sarcastic - You need to realize that I am in fact, being sarcastic, not serious. (que poor writing) To you bitching at me because it was the middle of the night and I was sober and horny - you've been there too, admit it. To you being sarcastic - I like your style... To you who dissed Yakov - He is a cool Russian when he isn't on stage, and may I add, you never met him. To the person who made the second comment which I accidentally deleted - WTF were you talking about there at the end?!  Before I continue with the rest of the blog, I would like to point out that I am an incredibly sarcastic person when I do write these in the wee hours of the morning, even though it is hard to convey it through writing.  Today: Woke up at about 11:45, got my hair cut, its to short and it sucks...I miss my old hair.  After that I went to the Festival of the Four States, got myself some bitchen BBQ and listened to my parents Zimbabwean music band, Kufara, play. Considering it was the hundredth time I had seen it, and the fact I have been to Zimfest three years running so I know what a real marimba band sounds like, it was pretty good. I jacked around at the festival for a few hours, then went home and got ready for work, at work I stood around for 4 hours and made 35 bucks.  After work I quickly drove to the Russian party, but got lost since I wasn't given good directions, after searching for half an hour I finally got there, it was pretty cool, you cant really go wrong with 25 drunk Russians.  I met up with my old friend Susha there, (who is now 21), and we reminisced about old times when I was 6 and she was 11 and we hung out together in Russia. After talking to her for an hour or so, I snuck my way to the cooler and made off with a bottle of vodka and some other stuff, most of which I'm saving for a good time...after that some friends and I watched Finding Nemo and just hung out...  Latest news: Summer weights program starts monday, at 8 AM......SHIT!  Susha invited me to visit her at Berkley this summer to party and smoke weed, do I dare accept?  I found the zebra moth lying dead on the floor of my room, I buried it in my moms Aloe Vera plants, which I subsequently used on my sunburns.  Many people in this world are dickheads  George W. Bush is a fucking  dickhead   My buddies Maher and Marsh sent porn to people from my email address, I need to remember to log off messenger when I'm not home.  Everyone needs to play the Bush game http://www.bushgame.com   until next time peace and prosperity
