I closed my eyes for a few moments and wheezed in blackness.  I don't like the feeling of not being able to breathe.  When I opened up, a few girls were standing around and I skated it off.  Then I had to sit in jail...I've been downing asprin 4 at a time throughout the day.  Hope this doesn't negatively impact that big Ice skating test on Wed...   Oh yes, I got all the classes I wanted.  Now I just have to find a professor who wants to work with me on a Senior Thesis.  I think I'm beginning to see the light.
