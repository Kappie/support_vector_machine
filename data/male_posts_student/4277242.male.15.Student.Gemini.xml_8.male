Incidentally if you'd keep a thing simple two more things will end up botched up.  Today I have decided to take a righteous action to the school canteen, which sells mostly useless trash they call food, like potato topped with "sour cream", a vile suspension that looks like wet plaster and tastes like stale yoghurt, and "munchies", a lethal object even the crows would fly away from (proven by an experiment performed by Lenard). Past crimes involving rotten food in this canteen includes a sandwich of a mysterious inedible pink paste, a tray full of tasteless pasta, a tray full of tasteless hokkien mee, and (lots more).  I am boycotting the school canteen! I will go to HCJC forever to eat lunch and will come down to the school canteen only for the odd tuna sandwich (which is not mysterious), curry chicken rice (too genuine to be suspected as something else) and drinks. HCJC canteen sells tasty and energy-replenishing roti plata there, and the HC students sure look happier than us for now!  Blunderbusses at the ready --  Shoot down the Western Food stall! Shoot down the Western Food stall! Shoot down the Western Food stall!  I also announce that the condition in which a blogger starts to enthusiastically publish articles on obscure songs be named "The Second Day in Dunmore Cave Syndrome." If you want to use it you have to cite sources.
