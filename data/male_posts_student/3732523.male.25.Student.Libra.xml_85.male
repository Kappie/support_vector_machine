    
      Finally, finally I have managed to get myself on the Blog.  Due to various hitches a) my lack of proficiency with anything remotely technical and b) the fact that I have a distinct feeling that Blogger doesn't like me anyway as it killed my last account...  I am here!  Unfortunately I don't actually have much to say, other than hullo again folks :)
