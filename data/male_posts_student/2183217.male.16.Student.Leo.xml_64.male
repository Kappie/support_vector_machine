Im So angry! When my mom brought me to the store to shop for my family, i picked up a paper weight for my grandfather in an attempt to HURRY  THE HELL OUT OF THAT HELLHOLE! and my mom yelled at me cuz i spend a gagillion dollars on my friends present and then try to buy my grandpa a .99 cent paperweight. Whatever, it's not like he deserves something better, like what i got him last year... GIRLS BUBBLE BATH! yeah , i got him pink peach bubble bath so he gets less presents and my grandmother gets more. Fuck Christmas. Also, today i took the whole dinner for the family , covered it in ketchup and brought it to my room. I ate half of the caserole out of the thing and put it back in the fridge with a fork in it, covered in ketchup. Take that, whoever made that stupid dinner. OH and another thing, one of lindz christmas presents from me this year, was a MOTHER MARY figurine, with an attempted decapitated head, and a burnt off face. I needed to take some anger out.  Ninjas; 0 Christmas ; 1
