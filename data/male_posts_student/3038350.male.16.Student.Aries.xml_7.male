I went earli to walk around the park but they were soo slammed that I clocked in and worked.. I dont really like to close, b/c I am done at 8 alright? well I dont even get to start my cleaning til about 7:45 and then when it is all done and I am done with my drawer (counting the money and paperwork) it is almost 9.  but I get paid $6 an hour so hopefully it will all be good in the end. I got home and I looked at mom and Danielle's pictures that they got developed.  I was ready to cry and I am still ready to because for 1 I saw pictures of Nicky when he was 1 day old when we had him, and 2 b/c I KNOW that I took a bunch of pictures of Nicky that day, and Mariah (the dog) when she was a puppy, and Lily and Diamond (the rabbits) when they were kits (baby bunnys) and I went the other day and got all the film that I could find developed and I didnt get any of them back.. makes me really sad! I had a hard day and I wanted to go through the park and see my little baby goat.  but I didnt get a chance to b/c I was running really behind, and my boss is really kewl, but he dont really help out at all, he was flirting with these 2 girls that come in 3-4 times a day.. if and when they come Mike becomes useless! other than that he is really kewl and stuff and he really helps you out.  I got a POUNDING headache and I am ready to cry.. I miss my Nicky soo bad!!! ok I am back now.. I needed to go to the bathroom and clean my face.. it got kinda dirty cuz I actually started to cry for a minute there.. sorry.  I really need to talk to my Edzo but he is at a birthday party and he said he will be back soon.. I hope so.. I am going to find something to do for awhile and then I might get off the computer and go lay down!  that is all I really know what to say right now.. ttyl! ~Donna~
