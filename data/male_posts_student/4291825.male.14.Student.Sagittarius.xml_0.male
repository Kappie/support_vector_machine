I accessed th einternet using some hair clippings, a zip-zap, and a pile of sticks. Today they made me eat my own shit and then hawl ass up to the highest mountain in maine at gunpoint. I had to clean the bathrooms with a spork, and they tied my legs to by back and made me dance for small scraps of raw meat.  Why hasn't help come yet? Hasn't anyone called the police or SWAT teams yet!! MIchael was close to picking me today, and who knows what will happen in th enext three hours. I cant stand this. Imagine being in the Texas chainsaw massacre and house of a thousand corpses only pultply that by how many times you have to go to school each year and thats how horribleit is here... PLease send help.. oh no there coming.....    TRANSMISSION DISCONNECTED
