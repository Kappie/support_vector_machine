It went off without a hitch, even in the face of advertsity.  Last minute changes modified plans and ruined some of the best inside jokes.  Because the poetry cafe was both a poetry reading/book release party and a fashion show, there were intervals between readings where the characters of the Alice in Wonderland-noir-glam show would come out, do a small dance or something of the sort, and then sit on stage.  I was Tweedle-dee, Aidan was Tweedle-dum, and Sloane (a colleague from SOTA for those of you who don't follow my story) was Dinah the Cat.  Aidan and I were supposed to walk around in matching noir detective suits, looking at everyone on stage suspiciously, and take our seats.  At a different interval, Sloane was supposed to come out, adjust her fishnets suggestively, dance around Aidan's seat, play with his hair, seduce him, and then sit on his lap.  Would've been a cantankerous laugh riot.  And it got cut.  Instead, Sloane walked out ahead of us, sat down, Aidan and I did our thing, we go to leave, Sloane pulls  me  down into the chair, and Aidan sits beside us.  A classy joke that would've had such relevance to the mentality of my associates got turned into an irrelevant sleu of awkwardness.  Superbowl - New England wins, Janet flashes nation.      As a finale to the halftime show, Justin Timberlake accidently pulled off Janet Jackson's breast plate, thereby having her breast exposed to everyone watching the Superbowl.  I mention this for the fact that February 1st marks the beginning of Black History Month.  What's the most dignified way for a black entertainer to kick off the month?  Why not have your tittie exposed by a freaky, beatboxing white boy?  (Note: This will most likely be the only time that Justin Timberlake and/or Janet Jackson is mentioned in this blog.  That is, if I ever post again.)
