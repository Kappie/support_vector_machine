Not even a good reason...hahaz (playing playstaion 2).  So had lunch at home, and after i went with my dad, to go choose some plants for my balcony. It was really boring actually all the plants look the same and the one i really wanted was to big. So in the end i settled for some other plants.  So soon my balcony would be boasting four types of palms, could you imagine! i was really tired and bored that i just chose four plants from about the same place, so it turned out to all be palms just different types but anyway they do not quite look the same apart from their leaves...soon i would be in horticulture!  Digressing, talking about plants i was trying to study for bio test and i realised that plants really are quite facinating, i mean if they were sucking up water due to evaporation how come trees in cold places are so tall? should it not have much transpiration since it sheds it's leaves? so not much water should be able to reach the top should the tree not just die?...ok. Enough of pretending to actually think of such rubbish.  So as i was driving back home.(dad was driving not me) I saw the this van which had such a perculiar name. "WTF bed and linings" so well gross isn't it. I mean wtf stands for what the fuc# and then bed and lining! i could not help but laugh at the strange name, maybe it was actually a prostitute buisness..My mine is wandering abit here hahaz.  Ok, i hope everything when well with the principal and all and i too am surprised she had time... did the tree heads sit in? (tree for wooden, blur, stupid, thick!) I hope everything when well, no council member knows about my blog right? Just ensuring.  good night now, or morning rather it's really late/early so i had be going to bed have not been sleeping well the past week.  Love to you
