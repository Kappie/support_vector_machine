He immediately tells me it isnt, y'know because he is an expert at Mini's. I copy and paste from their webpage and he tell's me they're wrong. And then he laughs at me because Mini is made by BMW. By this point I'm fairly irritated so I make my usual call that BMWs are better than Audis (Which Australia's two main auto magazines, Wheels and Motos, seem to agree with), With the exception of the A8 which is supposed to be better (I'm not sur eby how much) than the BMW 7 series. Deon tells me that Audi owns Lamburghini (Or however it's spelt) so that automatically means they're better. Well for one thing just because one company owns another doesnt mean thatget ALL of their technology, Audi still does most of their own stuff, or shares it with VW (VW is the parent company of Audi, Bently and Lambo). But according to VW Lamburghini is run as close to being a seperate company as possible to keep the same feel etc within their cars. and unless that has changed fairly recently im pretty sure im right.   But i mean that's not all that bother's me: The fact that I get a new car and he implies its crap He goes offline repeatedly so I can't rebutt he throws a whole bunch of semi related links which arent written by professionals and then thinks these few loosly related amateur sites are the truth  Tehres mroe but im far too irritated
