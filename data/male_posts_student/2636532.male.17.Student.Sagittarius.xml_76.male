As all of you know, tomorrow is halloween. and as some of you may know i hate halloween. it's a completely useless day of the fucking year! seriously, it's only for young kids, it pisses me off to see people my age that still go out trick or treating...seriously grow the fuck up! i swear this year if i see anyone my age come to my house i'm gonna dump a bucket of water on them and then slap them! and those little punk shits that try to egg my house will get it too, little fuckers! on another note, i discovered that web forums are very addictive. i can truthfully say that me not blogging can fully be blamed on the fact that i got hooked on them. but it crashed so here i am my little pretties, back and bigger then ever to blog to my hearts content. on that note...good night! -Matt
