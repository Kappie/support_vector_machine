I hate that i cant even talk normally to my best friends, they are not allowed to talk to me so when we talk is in secret or very disguised, i hate that i cant just call them whenever i want. Two of my other best friends are on vacation right now, so i cant talk to them either. Im so bored right now, i have a lot to do but i dont feel like do it by myself. I want school to start already. At least i found out that im going to have phsicology with Susan! men that's good news for me. I want to fall asleep and wake up and find out its Monday already. Is not that i really wanto to go to school, its just that i want to see people and i want to finish high school already, so maybe i can go to europe and study industrial design, or architecture.
