Now, I was only 5 at the time so I was like, "Gwandmaw, can I make some biscuits pwease?"  And she'd be like, "Yeah sure William Alexander Teat!"  So she'd make some dough and I'd play with it, put a little extra flour in it cause I liked the taste of flour, and "would shoot em in da' pan".  After they were done, I'd eat them.  "Wow gwandmaw, I did vewy good dis time wight?" I would say.  "Yes William ALexander Teat, you did".  I loved making those biscuits - they were so good!  Even the dough was good!  Everything was good!  I love my childhood, I love you, also.   That's how we do things round herrrrre.  I'm Will - see ya'll later.
