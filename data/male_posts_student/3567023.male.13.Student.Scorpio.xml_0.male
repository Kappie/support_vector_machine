What's the fondest memory you have of me? 05. How long do you think we will be friends? 06. Do you love me? 07. Would you hug me (please say yes.)? 08. Do you wish I was cooler? 09. Give me a nickname and explain why you picked it. 10. Am I loveable? 11. How long have you known me? 12. Describe me in one word. 13. What was your first impression? 14. Do you still think that way about me now? 15. Do you think I'll get married? 16. What reminds you of me? 17. If you could give me anything what would it be? 18. How well do you know me? 19. Do you think I could kill someone? 20. Do you think our friendship is getting stronger/weaker/or the same? 21. Do you feel that you could talk to me about anything and I would listen?
