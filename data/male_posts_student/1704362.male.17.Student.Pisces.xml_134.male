I dug a large hole with  urlLink Sam  on Long Beach Island. In the true American spirit, we outsourced the task of filling it in. I am listening to disco. I am very sick.   Many throughout history have mistaken the fundamental purpose of democratic government. It is commonly and idealistically believed that the purpose is to ensure self-rule and the expression of the "will of the people." I purport that people lack both the aformentioned "will," intelligence, and moral consistency to rule themselves. Rather, the most successful republican governments attempt to create a system of government that overcomes our shared human flaws.   Why not, then, completely remove the human flaws, and by extension, the humans, from government?       info.link:  urlLink http://www.rense.com/general37/char.htm   [Listening to: Car Wash -  urlLink Rolly Royce  (03:32)]
