I have a big project where I have to interview a person in a sales field and I'm going to interview Toms' dad but I need to get on it and have been procrastinating.  It's rough to do all this stuff without a car.  I also had a very good night on tuesday and then ended very roughly.  Basically it ended with me sitting at the wheel and Fat Anne Walden talking mad shit on everyone I know.  Screw that bullshit.  I am going to get drinking right now and enjoy this great day as it were.  Then I will finish my weekend which should be great.  I'm going to see OAR and Guster tommorrow night which should be cool but Sunday I'm going to Columbia, MO to attend the Stephen Covey Institute Seminar.  Should be good and help me do well with the rest of the semester.  Well I'm off to enjoy this beautiful day.  I'll get back to all you fools later.  Things will start looking better.
