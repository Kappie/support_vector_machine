It's like having a counselor that sits there an nod their head while I talk and answer my own questions or fine people like Scott and Arion post feedback (since I think you're the only two following my blog thus far).  Today was a really good day.  I was worried about going back to school because I'm stressed about an English paper.  My first class begins at 8:00-9:25 AM.  I originally decided that I would go to my morning class and then go home and maybe return for my late afternoon class.  Jackie, one of my classmates in my 8 AM DOS class gave me a HUGE Rose!  It was really sweet.  I started talking with her on Messenger recently and she's really supportive. My instructor also had a present I was greeted back with a five minute timed test.  I got 100% on it so that's good.  I hung out with some class friends after my first class and we hung at the cafeteria.  They're really cool guys and they've kept in touch while I was away and giving their support.  I can't thank them enough!  One of them knows all about me and teases me daily by lifting his shirt up and exposing his fuzzy happy trail.  He's done this every day he's there since day one.  Even before he knew about me.  He still does it and today he had just done it and said, "The things you miss."  I was thinkint the exact same thing.  He's awesome!  I can talk about anything with him.  English is at 12:00-12:50 and was informal this week she said.  Basically it was to get together and ask questions and get caught up on things.  Holly (my instructor) went over what I missed and will have the things I need tomorrow.  I was so worried about that class, but I should be ok.  There is a test tomorrow, but she's going to give me the review packet and I'll take the test next week.    I hung out in the computer lab for a while as usual.  It was like I never left.  Before my English class I was given a hug by one of my classmates.  In the computer lab I was given another hug from another classmate in my afternoon class.  The older students missed me and inquired about me.  The younger students didn't really even seem to notice I was gone (minus the two I mentioned before).  My 2:00-2:50 class was a little hectic.  I may not be behind in assignments, but there is a lot I missed.  We transitioned from HTML over to JavaScript.  JavaScript is the reason I took the course (other than need it for degree).  I know HTML pretty well, but learned about CSS (Cascade Styling Sheets).  After class I went to the Post Office, Taco del Mar, and then drove to N. Seattle to hang out at David's place.  I was exhausted apparently and it hit right when I got on the couch.  I lied down and fell asleep and woke up hours later.  Just got done talking with Dale (my roommate) on AIM.  He's really depressed about the whole house situation and his parents.  I feel so bad for him.  I hope once he sells his house he'll be done with them and stand up to them for the way they treat him.  They don't like his "lifestyle" and want him to go to church and a counselor to "change".  Tomorrow is Thursday and I will have a busy day.  I'm going to be receive the assignments from English to get caught up.  Then I have QUEST (my 20's group I go to weekly).  Normally I would go to the Everett Underground, but it's still closed due to water damage from a fire above.  I don't have classes on Friday's, but I'm sure I will be busy packing and doing homework.  Actually I'll probably make a trip to Mount Vernon.  I really don't want to pick up Dad's ashes.  I might just leave them there until the day we go to spread them on the river.  I'm optimistic things are going to turn around for me.  Please have positive thinking about me finding a place to live and the strength to get caught up in my work.  Take care and talk with you soon!  -Jason
