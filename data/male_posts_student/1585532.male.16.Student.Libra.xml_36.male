I dont' understand how it could take this long to send my ID.  Its not like I'm across the state or something, I'm a friggin rock's throw from the place!  Those assmonger retards have no clue of what they're doin.  They all need to die.  With all Christmas related stuff out of the way, all I have to do now is pretend to enjoy the holidays.  Though New Year's is way better...because of all the alchohal consupmtion.  (Oh wait I don't need to wait for New Year's for that!)  I have to eat at my Aunt's house for Christmas, which is farther away than any other relatives that live in Cali.  Plus her house is freakin small.  Its almost as small as my room.  As to how she's fitting like...50 of us in there, I have NO clue.  Well, I updated my site, and you can all stare at my desktop and watch almost every move I make now.   urlLink The Amazing Desktop Cam   Now you can all watch in amazement as I do...nothing.  Okay 'nuff said.  Bye.
