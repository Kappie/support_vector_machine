I was throwing wood around [at Jon... I cut his face with a piece] and some landed on Jereme's neighbor's [an old Chinese Guy's] lawn, and he flipped out so fucking much.... on only me, "if there's any wood on my lawn again I'm going to shove it down your throat!" ...so I of course told him that it was funny he had said that and laughed in his face :). Jon, Jereme, and myself left a HUGE mess on his yard so his dad flipped out too... we cleaned it up and left though. We didn't clean up the backroom, which we flooded with the house trying to fill the hottub, or the living room which had food and wrappers all over it too... I have to babysit ALL Saturday, from 11am til' 9pm ...fuck :/ ...later.
