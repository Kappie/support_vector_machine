And do the patrons, used to their chopsticks, have trouble using them?  Is there a learning curve for a knife and fork, like chopsticks?  Do the particularly ill-adept ask for chopsticks to eat their steak with because they can't handle a knife and fork?  Do they look at Western food and get flustered?  Or is it all pretty easy?
