Bar the awful 99 Problems, which does absolutely nothing to enhance the track, the album is absolutely sublime.  Mixing  Jay Z 's vocals with musical tit-bits from the  Beatles  White Album, the overall effect is stunning and is testament to the hours of sampling that Danger Mouse carried out on the beatles masterpiece. Working for weeks to sample every little drum riff and musical sequence that would complement Jay Z's final body of work.  The New Yorker published an interesting piece in February,  urlLink The Mouse That Remixed , which highlights the work Danger Mouse did as well as the subsequent interest that came his way. None of which, unfortunately, looks likely to get the album the full release it undoubtedly deserves.  Let common sense prevail everyone, and give this guy the break he deserves. An album, written for the personal enjoyment of himself and a few friends, identified by everyone who hears it as a masterpiece. Produced with no intent for personal gain, this album needs to be heard and in a perfect world would be.  Alas, to the dismay of the Prince, it seems destined to remain hidden.
