It also has the ability to walk along vertical surfaces, jump impossible heights in order to open the door and if Julia isn't nice, it bites her neck and doesn't let go. As always, I was left without comment. Such things are better left sem commentarios.   Spiderman 2 comes out tomorrow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
