Am in the big towery dead place. Anyway, pretty much other than Miller no-one will know what I'm on about there... hohum...  Did trombone practice, discovered I'm still not entirely the greatest man in Britain at scales, but you know... they're actually incredibly important. Damn. Ack, forgot to do my lip exercises as well. Naughty Jon. *sighs* Oh well, shall have to do about half an hour of them tomorrow. Opportunity to make up some new ones.  I'm good, thanks, Laura, just busy. I like it. Mind is occupied.  Quote of the day: "You let my hand go, And you fake a smile for me. I have a feeling you don't know what to do. I look deep in your eyes, Hesitate a while. Why are you crying?"  From Sonata Arctica's   Tallulah   Love, Jon Roskilly
