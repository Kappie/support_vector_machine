I mean, sure, I may not get in, but I'm pretty much hanging all of my hopes and dreams on it.  Isn't that sad?  Here I am, 17, young, intelligent, able to go to hundreds of other places, but I want to go to NYU.  Why?  Because NYC is home.  Sometimes you can just feel it, you know?  NYC is calling me, just like it calls thousands and millions of others each year.  But I just feel like NYC is where I need to be.  Waco, TX doesn't have what I want.  TX doesn't have what I want.  I don't think anywhere else but NYC has what I need to start realizing my dreams.  It's the City That Never Sleeps, the Mecca of the West, the Jewel of the Americas.  I...LOVE...NYC!  Now all I have to do is figure out how to get there ;-)  Philip
