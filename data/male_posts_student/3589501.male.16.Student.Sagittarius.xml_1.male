Kate was there so it was much better than the average day at the pool. we spent a good couple of hours together, played some tennis, swam some, but thats not the important part, just being around her is good enough for me.  Kate got her liscense today and is now on the road.  Earlier, she was doubting her ability to pass the test, but as it turned out, she had no problem with it. now she can take me places.  Kate gets off work today at 6 so i'll have to wait until then to talk with her, but keep listening, i'll keep you updated.
