We lasted 5 hours in that van and finally got in to the hotel I find out that I wasn't in the list and had to wait and finally was given the card to go to my room.  I left my stuff in the room and me and the other guy that wasn't in the list looked around the hotel for all the rest of the people but couldn't find them.  I finally saw my roomate and he told me where the place to eat was.  I ate porkchops with mashed potatoes.  I then went to my room and changed so I could go to the excercise room and did the bicycle thing then the treadmill thing for an hour.  While in their I met a couple of guys and one guy helped me with the running thing.
