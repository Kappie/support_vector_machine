Had to scramble it together because I interviewed the owner over lunch, but its a good one.  I also happened to pick up a book there: 50 Ways YOU Can Show George the Door in 2004. Great book for people who want to know what to do about getting Bush out of office.  k, well I'm extremely tired, and I have nothing else to say
