I was busy taking exams so I wasn't arrange dinner earlier. And Yesterday he has to wait for this professor to give him the evaluation forms and stuff.  The plan was:  1pm. Meet at victory monument 2pm. Arrive at ABAC BangNa campus 7pm. Dinner at Siam Brevery Hotel After that .. still don't know..  but he called and say the professor hasnt come yet and still don't know when will he comes. So I told him that I will go for dinner anyways coz i had meetings with friends already. If he can come, just call me. i will pick him up.  So this would be a dinner without him .. but really want him to come      (from left to right)...Ton and Pia...
