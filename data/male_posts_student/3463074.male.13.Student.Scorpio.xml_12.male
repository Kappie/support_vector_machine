Well, anyway, i found out it would be an excellent site for my first military instilation in the US. I have already hired 50 highly radioactive, rabids gerbils with plasma cannons to take out their defenses. The problem with my deal with the gerbils is i told them they could rule there for me until i raised enough money for there 1 million dollar fee. So, i am asking you all to donate money to help with my conquest of France. Don't worry though, when i have finally obtained France, you will recive a pencil for every dollar, a rubber parrot for eery 10 dollars and 1 acre of land for every 100 dollars. Finally, then person who donates the most money will recive the remains of the Eiffel Tower (meaning what isn't destroyed in the attack). The sooner the donations come in, the faster my plans will come into effect. Also, if you have any profoundly large magnets lying around (10 tons or more) i would be glad to pay you for them, i plan on taking over one of the space shuttles that NASA sends into space for some of my later plans needing it to transport my laser sattelite into space. Next order of buisness, my human genome project is getting underway and i need all the volunteers for testing that i can get. It pays great dental, $6 an hour, and you get to keep all the mutations that may occer (you lucky dog you, i have always wanted tentacles). My condolences to those who lose there mouths, but don't worry, only 8 out 0f 10 have had this happen
