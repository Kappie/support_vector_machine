I'm not going to write about Friday, due to the fact that nothing exciting happened and I wouldn't want to bore you to death with details that are not really relevant to that day!  Anywayz thank God its the weekend! I know that this week is going to be a blast and it is my half term which means that I don't need to go to school for a week!  I have a lot lined up to do in the half term, but I will keep you posted about that later on!  Bye!  Stefan
