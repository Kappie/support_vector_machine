The purpose of this site is as a informational posting ground for a number of things: One, the bashing, insulting, or ranting about stupid people affecting our lives(this does not include blatent rascim, sexism, pointless hating, or insuling other members of the blog, and plz keep the monotheists bashing to a minimum, there have enough troubles being wrong with out us telling them all the time).  Two, to inform on matters of video games, for example if anyone ever find any cool sites about games, or important info such as a  real  realse date for Halo2 of Half-Life 2 that would go here.  Three, reviews for games movies or anything else that you want to give your opinion on to the greater public.  Four, discussing the inherent goodness of pie, and the act of making pudding from jello mix.  These are the set purpose of this blog,  IT IS NOT A PERSONAL BLOG  we all have our own blogs to post on and ones such as the one made by Dustin on the twentith belong there.  If anyone would like to make an amendant or a clarification on this mission statement, feel free to do so or to ask about it, this is just me, if Dustin or Jesse want to mess with it, we can talk about it, but the recten post on the twenty-third sparked in my mind that a misunderstanding or purpose existed, i hope this clears it up. ~Elf0004
