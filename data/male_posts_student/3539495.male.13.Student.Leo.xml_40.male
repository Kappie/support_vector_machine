Really really bored. So I just passed the time listening to my walkman. The guys that were supposed to be escorting me because I was a minor didn’t look very happy. Aparently he had better things to do. But it makes me feel special when u got a person in a suit walking with you . Anyways I slept on the flight from London to Germany. Didn’t even get up while we were landing. So my ears hurt after I woke up. Like when I sneezed, they hurt and I was like “Jesus fucking Christ!” When I was waiting for my uncle of course.     The weather changes like every hour. Im inside and I look out, and its sunny. Then I want to go out for a walk, its raining. Then we go out to buy some stuff from the supermarket, and its sunny. Pisses me off.     Yup. And when people talk to me in German I have to go like “No German” and shake my head. Then they go, “Oh, you American, u Bush”. And then I either walk away or go ”No Bush”. So it gets kinda awkward.    Theres no one my age around here either. Everyones either under ten or like eighteen. I mean, not like i would be able to communicate with them.     We went swimming today. It was fun, there were water slides and stuff at the outside pool. Thank god it was heated. The temperature here is like fifty degrees. Really cold. But you know what I don’t get. Why cant kids go into the sauna. Seriously theres always a rule that says kids cant go there. I mean jeez, we’re not retards and going to get suffocated in there. Well, some people might. But survival of the fittest right. If you get yourself killed in the sauna, you’re just too stupid to live. Just joking. But there is nothing to do here after dinner. I could watch tv, but people yelling in a language I just don’t really understand makes me turn it off. Watched the euro cup finals though. Great match with Portugal against Greece. Dial -up connection and its going really slow. so im gone.
