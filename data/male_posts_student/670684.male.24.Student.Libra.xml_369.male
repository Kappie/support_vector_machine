A lot of sun, a lot of jumping in the water, and a great appriciation for alone time.  I don't mind roommates at all, but the five-way decision process and subsequent grabass that accompanies renting a beach house from a jackass named Bob helps to establish how great it is to set your own schedule.    I wonder if I really am older, or if I've always been this way.  I was the first one in the water each day, and often the last one to want to stop the beach games and funsies had.  But I found myself increasingly annoyed with the younger member of the group's antics.  Much of it reminded me of a band trip to Mountain Home I took in January 1997, where Bonnie and I got into it quite a bit because she decided she wanted to call me an asshole and just go after me without provocation.  Only difference is that she was 15 at the time, and I was a 17 year old full of jealous rage.  Here I'm 24 and have no connection to this chick, except she's dating one of my best friends.  But I tired of the bullshit quickly.    And I'm supposed to go to Lafayette tomorrow to see the Rubel/Broussard wedding, a wedding of two people I enjoyed in college, and it should be a good Centenary reunion, and one I should probably hit, considering I don't know how often I will be in the south again come August.  But a lot of me is trying to figure out how I can get out of it.  I've got work to do...papers to grade and a screenplay to write.  I don't want to divulge 12 hours of car time for 24 hours of time in Lafayette.  And I wasn't invited to the wedding, which isn't such a big deal considering how these joint Centenary matches work (the more the merrier), but I still feel obligated to go now that I'm supposedly the driver for Corey and Bryce.  They can take Corey's truck, which would work, and I'd get my time here.  But I wouldn't do shit with it except play grabass and get a little bit of work done.    I don't know where the bitching is coming from.  Had a great morning, got some good sleep (though cats seem to enjoy late-night coitus outside my room), and had a nice walk from my old neighborhood to JP's Java, where I got some good writing done and am back on track for Act II of my screenplay.  The writing feels good...I'd lie to say I wasn't worried about the future and how I'm going to make money and where I'm going to live, but it honestly shouldn't matter as long as I keep writing.  The trip to Matagorda gave me more ideas than I've had in ages...right now I've got four feature script ideas kicking, several shorts I had forgotten that I'd like to revisit, and four documentaries I'd love to shoot.  I'm 24...this is a process.  Get some work done, write some treatments, and try to get some grant money maybe.    The weather is great.  Warm.  I should be outside.  I think I will be, actually.
