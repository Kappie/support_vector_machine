In the afternoon, I watched X-Men II, the VCD which I brought at Carrefour last time. Ayioh, to tell you the truth, it was dissappointing. They cut away quite a number of scenes. For example, the one where they showed the effects of Cerebro on the mutants and humans. I was expecting these scences you know. Darn!!   After movie watching, I went online for a bit. At 5.30, I went down to buy dinner for brother , then rushed to CauseWay Point to have dinner with Wendy and Manda. I am going thete to give money to Wendy for my domain (WQ!! My $1.70! You owe me for two months! You better pay up ar! Or else, drastic actions may follow...) and eat dinner with her also.   I met them at LJS. Their colleague, Gavin, also came. Hmm...he's quite okay la. All of us brought Combo 1 (I didn't get cheated. The person said "regular drinks?" I said "small please". There!) During our dinner, so many things happened. For example, I scratched my face and it bleed. Gavin hates the sight of blood. We also discussed about stocks and money exchange. We also talked about WanWan's choice. Me, manda and Gavin supported WanWan's decision to marry YX, Wendy went against it. AFter eating, me and Amanda went to Popular to find Janet while the two went home.  We brought two packets of M and I said my farewells to Janet. After that, we walked around CauseWay Point. We went into Kiddy Palace to look around. We went into Courts and Computer ETC to look at her notebooks. We went into EMF before Courts, but we saw Govind and I panicked and ran away. However, when we returned, she wans't there. We looked around here and there. Lastly, we went into Metro and Wendy introed her boss and colleagues. I saw the Merlee, the cashier whom Wendy can't get along well with. Heh. At 8, we started going back.  Sigh. I am kinda worried for tomorrow! I mean, I am going to to Malaysia. What if I am robbed? I die le la! Moo meow meow! I must take precautions! Yes!! Ayioh! I must plan to record my programs! Only 6 hours! Charmed must be recorded! Survivor too! Oh my my! So ruan!  Okay. I gotta go le. See ya on Tuesday (Monday can't blog...maybe can la. I see in the afternoon). Night blog!
