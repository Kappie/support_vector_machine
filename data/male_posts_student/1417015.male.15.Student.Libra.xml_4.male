Which means I haven't been into work again, which means I'll probably get sack0rised. Which is truly fucking gay, and gay is homosexual.  So just when I was getting ready to go back to school, I get something else. Low resistance is gay. If things don't pick up soon, I may even not be in school for monday. Being ill is so depressing.  I'm gonna go to the bathroom and cough. BUY.
