Most of them were really something to write about. For some reason I've been taking all these inspirations and little life notes and tossing them into my short story. A dog jumping at a tree, trying to catch a cat. An ex-con trying to make up for his mistakes by joining the forces behind drug and alcohol counseling. Work is fool of good characters. New faces at the jewelry store and new drama.  I've been working on getting things ready for school. 1. Had a few meeting with councilors, that has been very helpful. looks like all my stuff will transfer. I will find out for sure in a few weeks. 2. March 1st I will start my first day of volunteer work with the Santa Rosa  Bird Rescue Center. I am really excited about that. I know that I should offer up my spare time for things worth something. 3. Job market sucks. I've almost given up. :( 4. Trying to work on a lit zine. Probably won't have time for it in the end.  Today was so amazingly beautiful. The sun was bright and warm and everything was all wonderful. That took about 2 hours to wear off at work. I was sick of people quickly and wanted out. I can't wait to get home and curl up with 'lonelyness.' The only time I ever feel real is when I am by my self.  I am so ready to sink my teeth into some learning.   current mood: accomplished current music: Hot Water Music - At the End of a Gun
