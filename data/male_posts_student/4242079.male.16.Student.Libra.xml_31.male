For me and all my thoughts of you It's eating me alive to leave you  Maybe it's childish  And maybe it's wrong But so is your blank stare in lieu of this song Maybe it's childish  And maybe it's wrong  Don't wanna be don't wanna be wrong You're leaving me, you're leaving me  in lieu of this song Don't wanna be don't wanna be wrong You're leaving me, you're leaving me  in lieu of this, lieu of this song  I'm breathing in your skin tonight Quiet is my loudest cry Wouldn't wanna wake the eyes that make me melt inside  And if it's healthier to leave you be May your sickness come and set me free Kill me while I still believe that you were meant for me  (Humming Part)  Finding my own words my own little stage My own epic drama my own scripted page Send you the rough draft I’ll seal it with tears Maybe you’ll read it and I’ll reappear  From the start it was shaky And the characters clash A nice setting for heartache where emotions come last All I have deep inside to overcome this desire A friendly intentions and fair-weather smiles  And I don’t wanna be, don’t wanna be wrong You’re leaving me, you’re leaving me  in lieu of this song Don’t wanna be don’t wanna be wrong You’re leaving me you’re leaving me in lieu of this, lieu of this song  Like Saturday night I’ll be gone Like Saturday night I’ll be gone Like Saturday night I’ll be gone Like Saturday night I’ll be gone before you knew that I was there   Lyrics from the band Yellowcard.
