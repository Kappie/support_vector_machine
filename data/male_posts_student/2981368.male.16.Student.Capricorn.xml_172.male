We were playing badminton, as usual, and that asshole of a caretaker locked us and another family inside, before promptly leaving.   So what did we do? We tried to break through the gate. We tried to unscrew the hinges of the gate. We tried calling the caretakers house several times.  We even tried to open the fucking lock with housekeys .  In the end, we tried calling the police. Which was pretty damn embaressing, esp. as the person on the line was laughing during the whole fucking phonecall. After ages of waiting, we found out that no, they couldn't help us.  So we had to jump the gate and make our own way home. I swear, if I find that caretaker I'm gonna kill him. ARGHHHH!!!
