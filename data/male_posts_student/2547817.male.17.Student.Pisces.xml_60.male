Relationships like those take time, feelings and emotions. Don't leave them on the shelves.  I went to the esplanade on Thursday night. Missed Vertical Rush due to a mis comm. None the less, I did get a listen to a few other bands. The trip wasn't in vain coz I sent quality time with my best man and gained experience and exposure in terms of music on the whole and genres. One band stuck out. "Cesspit", an interesting cocktail. A Singaporean mix of Caribbean jive and funk groove. They had more than half the crowd dancing to their damn tasty rojak. Couple damn good P.R. with trumpets trombones a damn good bassist and drummer and you've got THE WORKS! Maat bands rock coz I like PuNK r0cK gANgStA~! Haha.  There was a female lead guitarist for "March 12th". I was like wow! and thought to myself, damn, if Des is this good, I'll marry her! Haha! I'm hoping against all odds that negative repercussions don't entail this...  As we were leaving, some girl recognized me... but I couldn't remember her name and I didn't ask. Leon told me that she mumbled something about CAP though. Damn... Can't forget. Problem!  Oracion is falling apart slowly but surely. Damn.  Went to the beach with a third 04S12 on yesterday and had a good time. I like the beaches at Sentosa. Memories. Will probably never see them again. Upsetting.  I am now a man of many sorrows after reflection. Being soft sucks but is nice, coz I know I'm exceptional. I love you. Good night.
