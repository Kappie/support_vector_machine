Ok, look, can you imagine this is my second layout ever? No? IT IS!! Ok. Enough of that. I finalized a CD for Mario... It's filled with great MP3's. I'm listening to it right now... if you just take the Aphex Twin tracks and play them, they take you on a 2:23 hour joyride. Cool hunh? I'm supposed to be doing my math homework, but I don't have my book. I'm gonna play "Let My Fish Loose" by Aphex Twin... It's a remix from the original song by Nobukazu Takemura. Yay. I'm not scared of talking to Ms. Post anymore. She's stupid, and her test was extremely easy. I'm laughing my ass off at you, Ms. Post!! AHAHAH! YOU SUCK! I got a new uh... policy on my blog: I'm trying to keep web language (lol, lmao, brb... etc) at a minimum, because it's supposed to save time, but I don't need to, so I prefer to let myself be clear than to be a poser. By the way, for those who haven't noticed, I'm a straight edge!! Um... what else can I say? Um... oh yea, in Gaia, I made a guild: The Anarchy Guild. I , made it like a week ago, you know, to be in the official guild list, you've got to have at least 10 members; I've got 5 members already! And only a week has passed!! YAY!       Saturday June 28, 2003 - 9:19 PM  Today was so cool!!! I went (still didnt want to) the mall. It was the pain old mall it has always been, until I checked out a CD store... AND THERE IT WAS!!! After endless months of irrelevant search, I FINALLY FOUND ONE!!!! What was I looking for? APHEX TWIN!!! And there it was!! I bought Aphex Twin, Come To Daddy today!! It includes the following songs:   01. Come To Daddy, Pappy mix. 02. Flim. 03. Come To Daddy, Little Lord Faulteroy mix. 04. Bucephalus Bouncing Ball. 05. To Cure A Weakling Child, Contour Regard. 06. Funny Little Man 07. Come To Daddy, Mummy mix. 08. IZ-US  They all kick ass!!! It's not like any disc you've seen, it's got an extremely wide range of songs, and none of them having an similarity except for the theme! (the mixes dont sound alike) Some are tranquil... (IZ-US) Some are demonic (Come To Daddy, Pappy Mix) some are VERY alternative (To Cure A Weakling Child, Contour Regard) and some are really violent (Bucephalus Bouncing Ball). Though this may sound weird, at no moment will the sound disturb you, I could listen some of this music while studying! --- But now, apart from listening to my newly acquired CD, I'm extremely bored. Maybe my mom will send me off to bed soon... ARGH I hate sleeping. I'm not sure of what to write... um... I had this talk with weird red Mr. Powell, I was listening to Minor Threat (no one hears that) and then he came, borrowed an earphone and said: That's Minor Threat? Oooh man, thats cool, they made the straight edge thing! I was more like : shut up Powell, you freaking kid rapist who don't know a shit about what you're saying. Man I need to get myself a scanner. I do way too much drawings. Yawn. I know what I can do!! I'm gonna make some emoticons for my site! Woo hoo.  HI TYSON. duh. lol. (I put that 'lol' there because I was actually chatting heheh.)  ARGH RAWR *dies* NOOOO IF I GO DOWN IM TAKING YOU WITH ME!! *and then i uploaded the blog and went to bed, and yes, i took you with me.* Hmm.      Tuesday, July 1, 2003 8:21 PM  I think: people are weird. We're like fruits that you can buy at a supermarket. We come in different size, shape, color, and if it was as simple as that, i wouldnt even care to think about it, but have you noticed how strange it all is? its not in the body, its all up here in the head, either you understand or you dont care. Out of all the people i know, very few are included in the section of people who, study, analyse, and look back at every second of their life. How many people care so much about the past. drink. smoke. fuck. die. try. compete. lie. 3rd party. defeat. grow. I am amazed at how much crap i write.   Kicked in the head - breakdown Take a chance so you can be free Get out of this hole shoveled deep by insanity Why run and hide? Is it 'cause it threatens you? Trash anger for something new This fad has come and gone  Why can't you release the fear?  Open your eyes...Open your mouth... Open your ears...Don't hold yourself back Open up and release the fear  It's time so open wide Don't fight it let it ride Detonate history Destroy this legacy Why live a lie? You're just getting screwed Talk's cheap you're turning blue Pull the plug and push on  Open your eyes...Open your mouth...  Open your ears...Don't hold yourself back Open up and release the fear  Breakdown! Breakdown! Why don't you breakdown! The time is now! Can you taste it! You've got to kill it or it kills you! Open your eyes...Open your mouth... Open your...mind!      Wednesday July 2, 2003 8:33 PM  ROAAAARRRR!!! I AM INCREDIBLY PISSED OFF SO ILL WRITE THIS IN CAPS.... WHAT I NEED IS SOME FUCKING ATTENTION!!! SOMEONE LOOK AT MEEE!!! IM DEGENERATING, CANT YOU SEE IT, IM NOT WHAT I USED TO, IM NOT WHAT I SHOULD BE! IM STARTING TO GET SICK! AND ALL I WANT IF SOME FUCKING ATTENTIOOON!!! FUCKERS!!!! LOOK! IM FUCKING MAD. sigh. ROAR. arg i hate being mad... im over now. im quiet. lets jump around now, lets jump around like little tykes. woo hoo. and then we'll draw two x's on our hands, because we both know that we cant drink, and that we cant fuck, and that we cant smoke, and we will always be drug free, cuz were the only real persons who wont fall into the extremely categorizable category. lets open our eyes and imagine a whole new world, where there is no religion nor people, its only me, and i cant get bored because there is nothing to do. if there is nothing to do, iu wont be able to compare what i do with something else, and so i wont feel bored. i cant find my plave in this world. i cant and i shouldnt, and we'll all e happy, except me. im boring. still i dont know why people read this... do you wanna know how much i hate you? hahahah,.... now, i OWN this world. i made it. its mine. i can grab it and kick it, because its mine, its like giving a gun to a little kid, and yes, im the little kid. but someone has to take care of the little kid... so i think we can share the world, if u take care of me... right? might makes right. I am right now very pissed. mime. sure! old time hockeey! im happy.   i feel something pinty on my arm. ive got to save fast mom says i will go to sleep in more or less 13 minutes... i dont want to go, i dont like waking up. why are the keys getting so hard? this music really is ecessie i like no music dont. blurry. bluryy. bye itssss slippy tammi. v upi yp,pttpe nur     Saturday July 12, 2003 11:05 AM   I am so bored. Thanks to Gay J, this site is public, so I cant post anything here. Fuck you, Gay J. I'm going to Ignacio's house at 11. I don't want to work. I finally got Cap'n Crunch's ICQ number (My idol.). yay. I could actually repair the button down there. "Why should I waste my time? I don't want it, you can have it. I've got a new name for you, it's L.O.S.E.R.!" -- Loser, by Slapshot. and uh... I found that the same store that sells Aphex Twin CD's also sells Underworld. Woo hoo. My camera fucked up. The button for changing the pic mode doesn't work, so it got stuck on the video type. Now I can only take 80 second videos. No photos. Duh. Oh yea, Gay J also screwed a little too much around with my contacts (o.O). and uh... Gaia Online won't work. Aargh. Maybe I'll post up something more later. I don't want to go, but I have to. Damn. Arnoldo smells bad. Heh. It's eleven. Aargh. Vat da hel iz Cold Fee ooh she on? This sucks. I really dont want to go. Internet suddenly got SO slow. Man, I've got to go.
