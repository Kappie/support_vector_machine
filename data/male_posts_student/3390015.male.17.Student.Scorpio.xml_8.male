I strongly urge anyone who reads this to go see this movie simply because it looks visually stunning...and should be a pretty awesome movie with a stellar cast including Jake Gyllenhaal, Emmie Rossum, and Dennis Quaid.  For your enjoyment:        Sorry if the image quality isn't that great...I'm not too skilled at resizing and keeping image quality.  Please visit TheDayAfterTomorrow.com or Apple.com/trailers for quicktime versions of the trailers...they'll blow you away if you haven't already seen them.
