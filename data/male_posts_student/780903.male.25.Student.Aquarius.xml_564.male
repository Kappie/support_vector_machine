Here's most of a sentence I just wrote in an e-mail to a friend:  "I still have no idea how people manage to work at a job for 20, 30, 40, 50 years -- if it's not their passion and they're just there to collect a paycheck -- long hours, lots of days a week -- [BLANK]"  Help me fill that [BLANK] in.  What I ended up writing was one of these eight things:  A) "although I suppose collecting that paycheck isn't a bad reason to be there." B) "but I guess that's all of our likely fates since how many people can really work at something they love?" C) "without throwing themselves in front of a train or something." D) "so perhaps I should ask an investment banker to explain it to me." E) "but I guess they manage okay and I'll figure it out eventually." F) "and still find the strength to wake up every morning." G) "but I admire them for being able to do it." H) "and I guess that's why I still have two more years of law school left."  Can you tell which one?  I think it's kind of cool I was able to think of 8 different ways to end that sentence!
