Katt's and Hobbes' last name is Tygre. Pheen's last name is Niks. And finally, Leon's last name is Strechel. I also have some friends that don't live with me:  Cybe (last name not releasable): 18 yrs. Jane Strechel (Leon's sister and Cybe's girlfriend):18 yrs. William Blaine (everybody calls him B.B. for short): 7 yrs. Pyde Arack: 17 yrs. Giette Armour (Pyde's girlfriend and calls B.B. Baby Blaine): 17 yrs.  OK, Mack must be running out of robot ideas. Today he sent a pink robo-bunny holding a drum after us. I kicked it once and its battery fell out. Pa-the-tic. A guy downstairs came back from doing some marshmallow commercial. Before he could even get in the door another guy punched him into a wall. I think the first guy left an imprint. Katt and Camo (against his will) got the double's high score on DDR Max 2. And... hold on.   Gage just called. He told me to post that his dad got HULK on DVD. I've seen it already when it was in theaters. Well, I forgot what I was going to say before. Oh, well. Bye!
