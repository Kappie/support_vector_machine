What exactly are these things? Killing people for a few ringgit(Malaysian currency),  rape cases, animal torture cases... I went to the SPCA recently. What did I see there? Dogs and cats, either badly abused or abandoned. Some of them are recovering pretty well, others still have open wounds and stuff like that. Why did that happen? Because some "highly evolved" humans decided to keep a pet and then later changed their minds... highly evolved my foot!  One recent case about robbery was that a courting couple were killed, all for the sake of a few ringgit and a handphone. What is human life worth? Is it worth anything at all? Or are we just something that lives and breathes, and have nothing better to do? No other purpose?  I watched i,Robot yesterday with my eldest sister (yay!). It wasn't the most interesting show, but it did bring up some issues, as well as being quite funny in parts. One of the issues is, human beings and their existence. Vicki did make a lot of sense, human beings protectng themselves, no way! We are actually continually destroying ourselves. Just take a good look around you, and in the newspapers. Crime rates are getting higher, more and more diseases, wars on the brink of erupting...
