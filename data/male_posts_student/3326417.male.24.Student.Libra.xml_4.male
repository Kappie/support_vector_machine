I wonder how prevalent upcoding is in health care organizations and if this is a larger problem. It makes me wonder if the problem is so prevalent that it is a leading contributor to rising costs of health care in the U.S. Are the settlements that have been struck through deals, recourse enough to scare other organizations from stealing? I don't think it is. HCA Columbia should have been brought to its knees as well as any other organization that has been ripping off the taxpayer for years. It seems to me that in health care ethics questions it is a recurring theme of "if everyone else does it, then it must be ok".
