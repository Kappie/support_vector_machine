I think I will let her stay, after all, yesterday was friday night and she might just have been exceptionally nuts... I hope... I don't really mind her little outbursts as long as you find them funny/entertaining but if she doesn't learn how to punctuate her sentences, well... not even you can save her :P  But I'll give u a little description of her anyway...  Name: Lou Age: 12 Sex: Female Location: York What she looks like: A human form of a nuclear missile, crossed with a goldfish... Not really :P Lou's got blonde/brown hair, brown eyes, white skin (yes, another msn addict), oh, and she's quite short.  Have a nice weekend peeps!  LoZ
