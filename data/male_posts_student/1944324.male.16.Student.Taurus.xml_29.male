I'm excited like a normal person would be about the World Series or the Super Bowl, or like I would be about the season Premier of Stargate.  I want to see how it turns out.  Anything can happen. I've been forced into doing USX at Connersville.  That gives me about a week to learn how to Extemp. and put together a file with absolutely know help.  To make matters worse, no one knows where last years is (not that it would do us all that much good anyway).  Amar(at least two of you knows him, so I figure he's ok) has quite unexpectedly offered to give me a hand, and I'm grateful, if a bit confused.  His sister donated a bunch of stuff too, but shes actually nice sometimes so it was less surprising.  I still don't have enough.   Marten, guess who's gonna be judging and helping us out at speech meets?  Hint: it's an LN parent you know very well..... SQEE!
