I sang myself to sleep last night. I sang in while bathing. I sang it practically everywhere. HaHa! I am so obsessed with the movie, which is ONLY coming out June 4th next year. Darn!   Alright...today I studied about...let's see....4 chapters. HeHe! Well, I was pretty distracted over there, but oh well. I am gonna make it up on Sunday (tomorrow...duhz!). Hmm...I am okay with the fundamentals of Chem. However, I need to know more than the fundamentals to score an A. Hmm!! Ah Ji said that I know my Chem work, and all I made is careless mistakes, and I can't save them by studying even harder. He's got a point you know...but Chem's my forte. My best forte so to speak. Cannot let Chem grades drop AT ALL!  Today leh, I learnt the sacred art of MahJong!! :) HaHaHa! I learnt by the help of PS and Wendy's mom's game. Heh Heh! So fun the game! So addictive some more! Woah! I won twice! HaHa! Pung! Chi! Gang! Hu!!! Bwahahaha! I can't wait to play it in real life!  HaHa! I think I shall end here le ba....so see ya tomorrow.  Double double toil and trouble.....  Night blog!  Fire burn and cauldron bubble....
