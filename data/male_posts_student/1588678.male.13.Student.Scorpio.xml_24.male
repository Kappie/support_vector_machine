If you don't know what this Stats thing is, it basically tells you how many hits you're getting. Pretty cool, ain't it? I'm suprised to see that there's been 40 hits on my blog this month. I appreciate it yo! Okay, maybe I'm getting a little too happy, I'm mean, my brother gets like 300 friggin' hits on his blog in one month! Still, thanks a bunch. Keep those hits comin' and tell everyone about Suburban Myths.
