No one is told they can not go to school, or drive across America just because someone woke up one day and said, “I feel like driving across country today.” Classes that are taken on line can be completed at the individuals own pace, and at any time of the day that he or she chooses. We have the right to bear arms, freedom of speech, without armed forces standing outside of your home ready for a war. We as Americans are extremely fortunate to do what ever we want to, but the unfortunate side is that certain individuals may take advantage of the system and abuse it. It may be allowed for an employer to call an employee a jerk, but is it ethical? I believe that we are the most fortunate people in the world, and we as Americans should embrace each and every day without taking advantage of it.
