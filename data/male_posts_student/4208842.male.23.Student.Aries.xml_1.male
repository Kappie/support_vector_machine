Pressing down out swelling bucking against her roots  Outstretched arms dangle deadly ivy vines in her dark fairytale forest She sees past their poison. Yellow-brick-road shimmering like voluptuous asphalt on I-12 flanked with speeding pines and running dead smash into that heaven on the horizon  In her freshly rewound dream the city basks in the humid sunset She is a misunderstood harlot of opportunities and she rolls on the river a rotting red stick
