In one dream, I got kicked out of school because I cited a source in the body of the paper, but forgot to include the bibliographic information in the works cited.  They accused me of plagarism, and I kept thinking, "but i cited the author in the text; i wasn't trying to pass it off as my own idea" but they didn't seem to care.
