I understand that these are "large steps in becoming a woman" but I don't need the bloody details.  Seriously.  I don't write poems about getting hair on my nuts or waking in a pool of man goo.  I just figure that you see my facial hair and realize I've past pueberty.  And I assume that if you are in college, you have menstrated and I am willing to believe you without describing a warmth flowing from you every month.   Good day,  Jimmy
