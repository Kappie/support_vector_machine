By now everything turned into shades of black and blue. So there's an empty space with this other kid crouching in it. I turn around, hear something, turn back and next I know I'm hit in the face with a brick.  Scary part: Well the brick in the face woke me up with a jolt. But afterwards it literally feels like I've been shocked by lightning. I was even shaking a bit. It's not the dream that scared me but the aftershock.
