However, not just your  average garden-variety mizzle , or even the   more   than average thunderstorm downpouring. This was business. This was God flushing his heavenly toilet.  And  it lasted for more than an hour.          The effect?       Leakage!         After enjoying the spectacle outside massively for some twenty minutes, people began to worry about rainwater sneaking  it’s  way inside the complex - as it had been prone to during heavy rainstorms in the past. And after half an hour of heavenly torrent: lo !,  like a flood it rushed into the wood department. It crept underneath walls and bubbled up sewerage pipes. The drains were overloaded.         We ended up coercing the water out through the back door, and it took a total of  30 man  personel pumping and sweeping to keep the entire hardware store complex from choking up. ( second  floors excluded) I try to imagine what would have happened were there no people to keep the onflow under control… entire departments  would have been drowned , most likely.        The not so nice thing about this story is that the weather is not going to change any time soon, and that in fact later tonight another one of those heavenly heaves might fall from the sky.  And  if not tonight, then later this week.  Dutch summer at its best!   I’d  better train my sweeping muscles.
