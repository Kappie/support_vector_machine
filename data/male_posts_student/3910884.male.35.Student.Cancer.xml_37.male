Here in Pilien it's a wooden board with aircon provided by mother nature. A dog licked my toes and jumped on the bed while I was sleeping. Scared the bejeebus out of me because I thought the aswang were after me!    The similarities between both situations are that both families are honest, hard-working families who also volunteer what little time they have to become community leaders and to lend a hand in their own communities.    Just a quick note:    When visiting an Aeta community, for your comfort, it's better to treat the experience as a 'camping trip.' Keeping this in mind worked quite well for me.    On the way back down the THREE MOUNTAINS AND FOUR RIVERS:    OMG! I was resigned to walking down the 3 mountains and 4 rivers on treacherous mud paths looking over precarious gorges and thought it couldn't get any worse. Surprise surprise! It rained for about 2-hours while we were making it down the mountain (which is about half-way through the trip). Walking for 10-miles in wet underwear is very uncomfortable, so here are my suggestions.    For those of you who are lacking tsinelas finese and mountain goat skills, I would suggest wearing calve-length boots (hiking or old military boots should do). During the rainy season for you fellas out there, I would suggest free-balling it. Probably not so big a deal during the summer.     Anyways, the remoteness of the village outlines the stark reality of marginalized culture. Being in the bundoks, or mountains, illustrates how people can be forgotten and ignored despite their cries for opportunity (I'll elaborate more in my field notes).
