What the hell can't I have a boring life?  You know jus' school, and nice local boifriend, a nice family without fighting, the white picket fence, WAIT!!!  There is nothing like that at all!  So, anyways firts of i went to the "Three Days Grace, Counterize, and Down from Zero" concert with Lauren and Micheal.  Micheal, may I say is a mass cutie-pie, damn you rock boi, hardcore.com!  He is really sweet and sooo gentle at the concert we took turns being behind each other and our hands slowly rubbed up each others torso and in the car ride home, he placed his hand on my thigh and then he placed it in my hand and gently rubbed it with his.  So, Micheal if you read this, you really are awesome.com!  Then to Jared boi you still are number one in my book!  I will see you in less then 40 days!!!!!  *does happy dance*  It will be great, you know how to work it boi!  And to the quiet closet-case, who may be reading this, who is nameless... You look great naked!  Lol, don't lie boi!  I hope to talk more to you soon.
