Finished a thirty minute quiz in five minutes and messed around in web-page. I ate lunch. Finished an assignment that was supposed to take the whole class in thirty minutes. Read for the remainder of the period. After school my mom took me over to the library so I could get the next book in the series ( The Remnant ; two more to go w00t!). Then we went to go get things for homecoming and only ended up ordering the corsage (or however you spell it, at this point, I don't care). Then we went over to the DMV and I took my permit test. I passed the written test, but I failed the eye-exam. Since I am blind in my left eye, I have to get a recommendation from my optometrist. It kind of sucks, but at least I won't have to take the test again.   Today: During first period I got all my homework done before he administered a quiz. I finished that, then I read for the remainder of the period. During English a book log was due. I had done it the night before so I was in the clear. He then asked everyone how far into the independent reading books we are. He pointed to me, I said "um" then he said, "Never-mind, you are like 5 books in", which was true. He gave us our vocabulary books and an assignment in them. I finished that, and read for the remainder of the period. Lunch rolled along and I ate with everyone. Then I started arguing with Abby about the present. Claiming that you cannot measure the present. Anyways, I won't get into that. Then I had my free period. I was reading, then a few computer techs came in, and I hung out with them for the rest of the period (in the computer lab). We messed around and I started talking to one of the girls about Golden Sun. She is cool, she plays video games. Then during Biology I finished the guided notes, which happened to pretty much be taken from the book. Afterwards I read for most of the rest of the period.   Boring days huh?   Tonight I have Ground Zero and won't be home for a bit. We are having practice after for the youth run service on the 26th. I might post something tomorrow, I might not. Who knows?
