I NEED A VACATION!  well i guess if i just wait till spring break and i get to go to Paris, Versailles, and London!  OH DANG!  got my passport papers all worked out and im leavin on like march 17!  i cant wait!  oh yes and my sister is so cool!  i just realized it today that she really isnt as much of a loser as i thought!  hahaha!  she's a pretty awesome person.  yeah i love her.  thats right i said it...I LOVE MY SISTER!  hahaha!
