Sometimes stuff happens for no reason and there is nothing you can do about it. Sometimes regardless how hard you 'tried' and 'work' on a problem/situation the outcome still comes up short of your expectation. I believe, for now, the only weapon aganist fate is hope. If we can predict the future, then, we don't need hope since we can already view our future. Since we can't look into the future and future unknowns are unknown. The only thing we can rely on is "hope".  Sometimes I even felt I can't rely on anything...
