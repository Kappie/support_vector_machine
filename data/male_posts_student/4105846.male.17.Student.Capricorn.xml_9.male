I'm always assuming the worst, but you're going on none the less  there's nothing to cusion your heart led fall. Letters from further away keep pulling me close to home. And there's something to cushion my callous sighs. And I know that you hope for longer good-byes embracing for forever and falling in your eyes.   Pouring over photographs. I'm living in your letters. Breathe deeply from this envelope it smells like you  I can't be without that scent. It's filling me with all you mean to me.    Continually failing these trials but you stand by me nonetheless  you won't let me sink though I'm beggin you.  Phone calls from further away  messages on my machine, but I don't ever tell you this distance seems terrible. There is no need to test my heart, with useless space. These roads go on forever And there wi'll always be a place For you in my heart   So I'll hit the pavement it's gotta be better than waiting  pushing you far away cause I'm scared.  So I'll take my chances  head on my way up there. Cause turning to you is like falling in love when you're ten.
