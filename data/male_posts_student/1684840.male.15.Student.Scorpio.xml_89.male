All the days are dull, it goes dark right after school and it makes school a nightmare.  How great Winter is.  Oh yeh, forgot bout Christmas :P  Less than 3 weeks away, but the mood doesn't seem to be floating around for some reason :(  My Birthday present of Dad should have been here by now, but as I exected, it isn't!  I can see it coming during the end of this week, hopefully.  I went to bed at 10:30 last night to see how big a difference to how my body felt in the morning, and to my suprise, I felt GREAT.  Plent more early nights for me :D
