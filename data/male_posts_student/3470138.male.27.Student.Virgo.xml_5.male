She still needs me I can tell but she still doesn't want anything serious. so thats it for me. I've decided to cut her out of my life when she leaves agian in September. It's done. I'm done. It's shown me what I don't need. And what I don't want. So I have to thank her for that. but it's also kind of twisted me as well.   I'm at that point that being heartless is the only solution. I need to move on.
