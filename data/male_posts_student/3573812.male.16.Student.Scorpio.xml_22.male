This is the most they would tell me about my IQ type before I have to pay $12.95, but screwed if I'm doing that:   Your Intellectual Type is Word Warrior. This means you have exceptional verbal skills. You can easily make sense of complex issues and take an unusually creative approach to solving problems. Your strengths also make you a visionary. Even without trying you're able to come up with lots of new and creative ideas.   I don't think they really describes me.  I don't feel like that kind of person.  I'll bet using words like 'exceptional verbal skills' and 'unusually creative' is to get people to pay for their own 15 page IQ report.
