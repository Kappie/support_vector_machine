Believe it or not, I just watched Spider Man 2 kanina and Catwoman yesterday...they were both nice movies...  I found Spider Man 2 nicer than the first mainly because I was able to grasp the introduction of the storyline more...maybe because I am now more "mature" in a sense...  Anyway...I have to get sleep na as I have a 730 class tomorrow at CTC so there...  Just went online to check mail and stuff...   --ZzZzZzZz--
