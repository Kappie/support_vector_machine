Tanya, Michael and I are all on MSN talking about her blog, and then michael has to go. So I mentioned that she was right, friends do need to make plans. So that cleverly planted hint got us scheming. First we were going to go to a carnival...Too expensive. So we settle for Roller Gardens. So I call tanya as soon as I find out the easy where there, Stonechurch Bus, is closed at 6. So she is on her cell on a bus trying to explain to me. So I decide to just catch an Upper Ottawa at Gore Park. So my mom picks me up at a bus stop and drives me to gore park to meet tanya and take the same bus together. So i wait, get on the bus, and then find out she caught an earlier one. So I arrive at Roller Gardens, and there is tanya. So we wait and 10 minutes later Michael shows up. So we proceed in, and Tanya rents inline skates. So we find a table, and an old aquaintence of tanya glides over. She brings a male over with her. So this guy starts talking to tanya and then they dance. During the dance he GROPES HER BUTTOCKS! So then they finish and he lays on her! So she excuses herself to go to the bathroom, and outside of it she converses with Michael and I. We start making plans to escape. Michael and I pretend to be sick and leave. We wait in the lobby, and she doesnt show up. So we talk to security. They cleared the dance floor so we could walk through, and then we talk to security some more. He ensures we get to the bus stop safely. Then we took the 22 Upper Gage Bus to Lloyd D. Jackson Square. We get to the Famous Players Cinema at around 10:40, and the last movie started at 10:30. So we arrive late and watch the movie which was a meant to be scary serious drama but ended up making me laugh. So after the movie Michael calls his mother and we wait. We see her drive by 3 times until she stops for us. Then we spent time laughing and talking in the car, desperatly trying to find Tanya's house. We do, and then I go home, and then I wrote this blog after taking my medication. The End. "
