Also had a test today, I think I might had straight flunked it. Bloody outrage! Maybe I deserve it, I said a bad thing about a girl, my bad. Just not on, just isnt me.  Had to go home on the train standing, in the middle with no support. Man diddn't they know I was already too tired to do foot gymnastics.  Coming home is no better, got a mini-assignment due, I'm meant to compile group members' parts, they haven't sent anything and its due toBloodymorrow morning.   Just Great
