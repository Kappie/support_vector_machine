I took my new camera and went around the back streets of Nampa looking for places where I would post the picture.  Found this little whole of an alley and took a few shots.  Converted to black and white (planned that all along), did some cool level tricks and added the poster.  It was missing something yet, so I went to Corbis.com (don't tell Billy G) and grabbed an image of homeless people and added it in.  Did some "color" correction and wah-la. Volley returned.
