This will never see the light of day on a national stage.  UPDATE: Well, it has trickled onto the national stage, but the big media certainly hasn't done much covering of this story (unlike the fevered coverage of the non-scandal about Bush's National Guard service record). All I want to see is an admission that there is a scandal and a defense by Kerry's team.  Overall the story is not much of an issue. Even if the charges prove to be true the end result is that Kerry told a lie. [heavy sarcasm]Politician's lie? No freaking way![/heavy sarcasm]. The only thing this tells me is that Bush has a greater tendency to stick to what he says and that you have a greater chance that Bush will tell you straight up where he stands. Kerry not so much.  Again, no surprise there.  I'd rather to see the personal attacks end. Give me issues and plans for the future. That's what I'm interested in.
