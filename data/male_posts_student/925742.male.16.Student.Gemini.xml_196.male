Let me add perspective.... sliced bread is the king of the 'non-sweet' bakery.  So am I to her.  A king.  Or, more accurately, a really attractive king.  So here's the dilemma, she wants me to go to her place for dinner.  Sounds interesting, right?  Not to me, I barely know her and her phone doesn't even work.    So I really don't wanna go to her place.  So I won't.  Though I really don't want to crush her.  Well, eh.  Too bad.   =========== HUMOR ===========  WrathS 01: well im gonna go ahead and delete my c: replacement on d: WrathS 01: since im not gonna be reformatting mralexpants: lol mralexpants: good WrathS 01: CHRIS?!?!?! mralexpants: stfu mralexpants: lol WrathS 01: HAS:DGO"SU{U HP{IJ mralexpants: stfu you goon
