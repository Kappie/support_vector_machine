Well, hey there, hi there, ho there,  Alas, the long weekend is over, but we have the next normal weekend to look forward to! Yeah, finally. Power ties to the max! hackage to the mackage! anyways, Some people need to pick up their posting. No one likes bagels and breadsticks posts (0 and 1 for the intelligent ones out there). And lauren: if you did forensics you might not stutter! and if someone else who doesnt post joined they might be adept at debating/arguing. and up to date on current events.  Damn the braves! how could they lose?!?!   -Mikeo   "Life does not cease to be funny when people die any more than it ceases to be serious when people laugh."  -George Bernard Shaw
