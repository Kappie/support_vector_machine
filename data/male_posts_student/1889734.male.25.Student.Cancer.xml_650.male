After my resolutions last month to go legitimate on my software, I managed to construct a dual boot situation on my PC, where I would run my Windows copy next to Linux.  The idea was to spend time learning Linux, so I could dump my unclean copy of Windows and no longer make Bill Gates my personal slave.  Over the past few weeks, it is clear to me that the two operating systems were not playing along together.  I was getting steady file corruption.  So this weekend I decided to clean out my system and return to a single boot Windows XP configuration for the time being, while putting Linux on my second PC so I can continue to learn.  Well, somewhere in the process, the corruption spread.  I lost a pretty good chunk of data (mostly replaceable), and all my iTune downloads (which may not be replaceable).  When you purchase a song from iTunes, you pretty much have to protect that data, since you can't download it again.  I had about $97 worth of music I had purchased over the past month, and it's all gone.  There is a small chance Apple will have pity on me and let me download it again.  I've contacted customer service, and await a reply.  There is some hope, as I've read of Apple having pity on others who have suffered crashes.  So I'm sure the wanton pirates out there will feel smugly superior over my misfortune.  Personally, this experience doesn't change my perspective, even if I the money and files are lost.  What price can be applied to your own values?  So laugh away.  It is pretty funny.
