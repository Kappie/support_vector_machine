Today was full of happiness, until the end of it....that was sad..I have hurt sumone yet again, and boy do I feel like shit.  I had to wake up by 9:30 so that I could hang out with Brittany... I hung out with Brittany at her house... A bunch of us climbed around Glen Park for a while... That was UBER fun... Then we went to DQ... Where I got really quiet... Then we went and hung out at Tina's... We made arrangements to hang out at my house... A bunch of people came to my house... Tina and I spent a large ammount of time trying to kill each other with a frisbee/football... We played a kickass game of CTF*...         *CTF=Capture The Flag I ran from Tina in my woods and we both got scratched up pretty bad... I got a stick to the eye... We went to Kyle's... We played MORE CTF... I was the ride bitch... I got angry because people left and I wanted to talk to sumone... I caused sadness... I'm sitting here writing this...  Think that pretty much covers it...anything with a "..." after it means that sum other stuff happened in there, but I don't have all night! Today was fun....yet overall depressing...that sux. Everything has it's ups and downs...poo. Now I run off to Dream Land to pursue happiness... Nighty Night!  Spense
