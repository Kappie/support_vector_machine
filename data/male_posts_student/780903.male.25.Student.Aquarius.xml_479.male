Notice the "never heard of" category, which can make you wonder who the 1% of the population is who's never heard of Hillary Clinton and the 4% who's never heard of Dick Cheney.  And apparently it was only six months ago that 1% had never heard of George W. Bush.  I guess he must have done something recently to increase his profile, for those who missed the fact that he's President.  Maybe he made a cameo in a music video or something.
