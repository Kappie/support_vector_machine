"low EQ ka na D Lo!" i could almost hear my (former) blockmate/crossword puzzle buddy/fellow miniature toy enthusiast Johann Leonardia say...      what to do in a dead end post, apart from ranting and raving and sleeping? i decided to channel my energies to something creative, and this is part of that endeavor. oh, i had planned on writing at least 3-4 pages worth of stories or poems or anything, but just kinda fell short. way short! ending up with just one poem.      so there, tell me what you think, my audience of none. till next time...
