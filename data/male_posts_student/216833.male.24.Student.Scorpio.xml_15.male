It's a weird twist on the feeling of meeting new people because I don't really admire these people as much as I just plain find them interesting.   mimi's mom was in town for a meeting and she had invited us out to dinner with a group from her office. I was dreading it.  I just really didn't see it as being fun, but I was hungry, and it was Tex-Mex with a vegetarian menu so I sucked it up.  The place was like a crowded bar, oh wait, it was a crowded bar filled with the cool and trendy.  It was a really cool place and it was half-priced entree night so I could see the reasons for being so busy.  Hell, tonight they have 50 cent margaritas, I can just imagine all the people there then.  We walked into the waiting area and there was this group in the middle that we were meeting up with.  Let me see if I can get this right, but there was Jerri, the old yank woman that moved her giant pear-shaped body around like a weeble-wobble. Her shepardess, Tiffiny, who was the young, repitively defensive and also over weight girl who seemed to feel the need to protect the thought of her open-mind as Fort-Knox.  Next to her was Rose(i think that's her name), not much to say about her except the fact that all of her stories seemed to be very anti-climactic.  Also, the host's of the dinner, Lee and his wife(I forgot her name).  Young, maybe late 20's early 30's, very much caught up in the city life of Dallas.  Into all the lights and sounds of city culture.  I found them to be more inspiring than the other people at the table.  Lee's wife scuplts and paints.  Lee seems to be very sucessful and I could see that his charisma is what got him there.  He really didn't seem that overy interesting but he knew how to deal with people, something I am really not good with.  His wife was able to pull out some very interesting topics and we discussed art, vegan resteraunts, and music; Lee would occational note additions to the conversation. The food was really good, I would go back.  Maybe on a less crowded night.   today  Just going through the same uninteresting things; the life of a computer geek.
