She allready gave us our final project to work on so whats the point of going to class today? We are not going to have any new assignements so I didnt want to be there.   Man, jsut now I was talking to Rob, this other Rob I know, he is a really cool guy and he gave me some really good ideas on how to setup my own network in my room.
