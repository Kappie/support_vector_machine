"keep on keepin on"  mrJoe:that's what's important right now.  mrRee:yea.  mrJoe:friends.  mrRee:you should look for a friend that's a girl. (an ugly one)  mrJoe:lol  mrRee:seriously... cause if she's cute then you might start tah feel "it"   mrJoe:for real.  mrRee:that's the truth you know it.  mrJoe:and that's why i question your " i just want a cute friend"  mrRee:"keepin it reel"  mrJoe:you got lisa it's all good  mrRee:dude... NO. it's not.  mrJoe:just give it a chance.  mrRee:no way.  mrJoe:you never know.  mrRee:yes i do.  mrJoe:you might find the love of your life. God might be like: time "mrRee" it's time she's the one. i want you to learn to love her. hahaha  mrRee:i'm as sure about her as you are about... "tina" . nope. no bueno.  mrJoe:lol  mrRee:remember god knows how much we can handle.... and he won't put us through more than that...  mrJoe:we humans put so much value on physical beauty.  mrRee:...and trust me she'd be way too much.  mrJoe:lol i wonder what my chances are... of meeting another person... that blows me away. i think some people go through life without ever meeting a person like that. i know, i know, my life isn't run by chance...  mrRee:well seeing that there are 6 billion people in the world... it's got to be better than that.  mrJoe:yeah 6 billion but you can start cutting at the number. how many are females then how many of those are in the right age group  mrRee:yah thinK? or you think that most people meet people and don't realize it or don't give it a second thought, but since you may have had a chance...yeah...  remember : love has no age.   mrJoe:well that's all part of the forumla i'm getting at.  mrRee:mistake: knows no age  mrJoe:reasonable age group. then how many will be "all that" to you. and christian and a mature christian and not a jehovah's witness i dunno...the numbers start slimming and then...when you finally get down to that "blow you away" category what are the chances you will ever cross paths. that's what's crazy about it all. the probability is... well miniscule.  mrRee:but it happens everyday.  mrJoe:it happens every blue moon.  mrRee:no... everyday... just like somewhere in the world... i'm sure it's happening even as we speak (or im) perhaps...perhaps not.  i dunno. that's why we're friends... i've got enough optimism for all   mrJoe:lol. you know what i think about?  mrRee:? kids? making babies?  mrJoe:how i want it not to be easy...  mrRee:?  mrJoe:that it will be a challenge to get w/ that person because  mrRee:have to work for it huh?  mrJoe:when the goings get tough i want to be able to look back and be like...this is how much i wanted her.  mrRee:you're "prodded to good works" true true.  mrJoe:you hear from M?  mrRee:nope. not since the reply email.  mrJoe:i see... how are you doing about that whole thing now.  mrRee:i don't... but i have a peace about it.  mrJoe:hmmm...  mrRee:it's all good. like i said, i came to quite the understanding while we were "away"  mrJoe:i don't know if i'm just whack or not...  mrRee:waht? mistake: what?  mrJoe:i just..i have peace about it. but i still long. and the longing can get pretty overwhelming at times. like the peace doesn't replace the pain.  mrRee:that's cool... obviously not the longing... but maybe you're at peace in your spirit...and out of wack in your emotions. ?  mrJoe:that i know.  mrRee:yeah.  mrJoe:like i know it's all good. that it's all in His hands  mrRee:yea.  mrJoe:and that He will take care of it all... and that's right where it needs to be. that it will be the best. His way. but I still feel... it's strange though there are days like today when i feel so objective about it. like i'm outside myself. observing.  mrRee:i've known the feeling.  mrJoe:yeah... like i feel ok today. i don't "feel" the longing but i know it's there. objectively. it's just quieted for now. dude i keep getting these little kids im'ing me. i need a new email address.  mrRee:lol you can't... that's the email you gotta have and you can tell your kids...  mrJoe:they think i'm a girl named Erin or a girl name Joanna  mrRee:it'll be a good story... kinda like "gas"  mrJoe:or a girl named Cheryl  mrRee:lol joe.. is there something you wanna tell me?  mrJoe:i get little high school boys hitting on me. it was funny i got sick of it the other day  mrRee:you know you can open up to me...  mrJoe:this kid kept imming me.  mrRee:i won't judge....  mrJoe:so i finally replied. dude- im's are lame ask her out in person for god sakes.  mrRee:seriously.... you can tell me...  mrJoe:rrright  mrRee:i thought you were acting a bit funny when we were camping....  mrJoe:me? haha what about you  mrRee:hehehe what about me?!  mrJoe:getting crazy w/ cliff in the tent.  mrRee:what?!  mrJoe:and rubbing my nipple.  mrRee:i rubbing?! i was trying to bite!  mrJoe:ah..that's much better.  mrRee:(wink wink) man i'm thinking about going back up there, either this weekend or next... just to hike fossil springs again....    mrJoe:really? lol that was a long hike.  mrRee:it was fun though... i enjoyed it.  mrJoe:i liked when it ended.  mrRee:just gotta find a hiking buddy... and no i'm not asking lisa.  mrJoe:lol dude she would rape you.  mrRee:i know this.  mrJoe:i dunno know about next weekend. but i'd be down... in a while.  mrRee:lol riiiiiight. at least you got your walking stick.  mrJoe:i do. it felt good to do it. after it was done.  mrRee:i know... you need to ... as out of shape as you are... yeah. just make sure you eat... cause if you start doing that, then you'll really be skinny...    mrJoe:i'm goin to start swimming at night.  soon as it's warm enough.    mrRee:you'll go from a 26" waist to like 10.  mrJoe:do some Cardio har har har.
