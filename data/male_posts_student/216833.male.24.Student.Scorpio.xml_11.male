Got off a bit early from work and went over to the dentist office, I didn't have to wait very long to get into a room, which was cool, but i had to wait on the dentist forever it seemed like.  I was going to check and see what could be done with my broken partial, I have it just sitting there and it is  very  annoying.  She told me I need a bridge, fuck, that sucks because that is like 2,500 bucks for a fucking tooth. Anyways, I was pretty upset, walked to my car crying becuase I know it will be a few months before I can get the bridge and that means I have to deal with this broken 'false tooth' for that much longer.  I went home and cleaned up the house real nice for the Art Collective meeting.  No one came.  I laided on my bed for about 40 minutes and read a new book I just got at the library.  the history of buddhaism. It's pretty interesting. I was about to fall asleep, but I finished the chapter and laid my head down.  8pm i was asleep and mimi woke me up at 11:30 and told me to get undressed for bed, i still had my pants on.  whatever..........
