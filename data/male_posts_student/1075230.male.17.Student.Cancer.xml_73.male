Emerson's birthday party. Happy Birthday to you *looks at watch* Yep. And I said Happy Birthday to Von as her birthday was um... Sunday (today? yesterday?)   *looks around*  Actually I  did  sleep in, but I got to school in time anyhow. ^-^... and gomen ne... I didn't  exactly  forget I had school...  I remembered I had school, and I tried planning it so it'd be after school... Demo... I thought school ended half an hour earlier than it actually does. And... you can note that when you talked to me, I said "You can call when I'm studying, or sleeping." Now... I know in Canada, studying means you're at home... er... studying... but I guess I picked up the filipino inuendo that when you're at school, you say you're studying... ah... gomen ne...  OOOOHHhhh... Almost forgot... how could I forget... *bows to em* sooooo sooorry for staying sooooo late... *bows*  Well, g'night.  -ArV
