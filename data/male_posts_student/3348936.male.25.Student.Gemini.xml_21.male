Then on Friday, Ina dragged me out again (its always her fault by the way) to the Union again for more pool and beer.  On Saturday, went out for Geoff's birthday.  Which dispite my best efforts ment another 3:00 am finish.  And then to round it off a suprise dinner for geoff last night. I was not in the best of moods this morning.  But to make matters worse its Marianna's leaving do tonight.  Perhaps I should just give up....
