    
       Right, this is an easy one. All you have to do is write a program.   Here is what it does:  The user is given a list of cards which are arranged in columns. He/She must choose a card and keep it in mind. Through repeated shuffling, the program will ask him/her to identify the column in which the card is. In the end the program tells the user his/her card. The cards in the columns are randomly selected into the column, that is, you can't decide the column in which a perticular card goes.   WARNING-- I have the source code that's available on the net for this, so don't try to give me gum.    ---- Bloodfist out.
