Meaning, that i didnt have to get to school until 9, and furthermore that i had no classes which meant no homework which meant further brightening of my day. the cruise itself was an enjoyable experience in its own right. i got to sit on the bow of a very nice boat, and comment on anything i liked with Dr. Zoubeck. I took lots of photographs (only because i could)... However, my day got SO much brighter when i got home and my new shoes had arrived. Now, i am not one to obsess over an article of clothing. But these shoes are very shway. they are puma anjans in blue nights/chinese red...pic will be posted for all to enjoy. So essentially, my day rocks. Now all i have to do is write an essay that was due on monday. Sweet!
