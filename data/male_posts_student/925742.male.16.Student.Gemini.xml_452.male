Ever notice how in dodgeball, when the last few people are still in against half of the other team (the good half), they always get out in a barrage of balls?  Its like, the people that are left have 2 balls in each hand and the fucking all throw at the same time, and the poor people that are left on my team just get owned like 3 or four times over.  Its great stuff.  Second hour, oh man, I think thats the most strenuous English hour I've ever had.  It was a good kind of strenuous.... very productive.  I read a fewa articles from Newsweek or something and then wrote four pages in pen answering an essay question.  My god, in an hour and ahalf, my hand was so cramped and covered at the bottom in ink.  Haha, it was kinda fun, in an over-achiever sort of way.  Today, after work, I think I'm gonna work on my Latin Teaching speech.  Should be fun.  Third hour, I was tired.  Biology, although innately interesting, makes me sleepy if we take notes.  Fourth hour was some good Algebra 4 testing.  I say I did pretty well, the test (to me) wasn't hard at all.  You know.... in all my internal turmoil, at least I'll have some good friends and good grades.  While I was volunteering, I think...... THINK..... I repeat..... THINK (I'm wrong, probably) that the girl I was around was flirting with me.  Yeah... hm.    Frankly, theres some pretty fine girls over there *devilish laugh*   aaaaaaah I'm a horrible person.  Then when I got back from that, I went to the store with daddy-o and then went home.  I watched Slayers Episodes 8, 9, and 10.  Its a good anime.  I like it.  After I finish Slayers, I'll probably go watch Lodoss War.  Since I've been single, I've been going back to the things I had lots of fun doing.  Not to say not being single doesn't have perks, eh?    Wow, if I ever want to get my mack on proper, I'll need a driver's license.  Mack on proper... hahahah.  I ate a freaking bag of Funnyuns last night.  A whole ones.  My god, my breath still smells.  I'm just gonna head off to work.  Now.
