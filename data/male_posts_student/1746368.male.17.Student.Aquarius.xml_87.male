The computer is quite fast and even though it has Windows XP (which I don't like) it's okay, temporarily. I wish I could be somewhere else right now, like over at Dominique's. I am so bored here. I'm sitting here, eating my peanut butter crackers and then my chips and I am doing absolutely nothing.   I got a new game a couple of days ago (I can't remember if I told you about it already). Mario Kart: Double Dash. It is awesome! I feel sorry for everybody else who doesn't have a Gamecube (more for the ignorant then the ones who can't afford it; at least the ones with no money wants one). Those who will never experience it, come over to my house, then you will want to get a Gamecube (I'm excluding you Steve, you're too far away). That is all for now  "On the other hand you have five fingers" --Steven Wright
