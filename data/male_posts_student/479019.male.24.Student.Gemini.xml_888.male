Could you be mine?” – Mr. Rogers  Indeed it was a beautiful day the past 2 days in the neighborhood. Not a cloud in the sky and I burned myself a new CD. Sunshine and music are two powerful things that can really change your mood. I think that without this break in the gloom, I would have really started to go insane (more so than usual that is). Today is a bit more gloomy, but at least the temperature is nice.  I don’t know if y’all have noticed, but my regular blog and my xanga have been slightly different in their posts. I guess I’m trying to be a little different in my two pages. I think, though, that I like the current look of my   urlLink xanga   enough that I’ll implement some of the visual aspects to my blog: namely pictures, more red coloring, and bolder text. I think that things just stand out more on my xanga, whereas my blog looks kind of bland.  I saw  Kill Bill vol. 2  yesterday with some professor types. I haven’t seen vol. 1 yet… oh well I knew I should of rented it, but I guess I’ll just watch ‘em backwards. I get the feeling I would have appreciate vol. 2 more if I had seen vol. 1. Oh well...  We caught a matinee showing and went over to the  urlLink  Ale House  . Mmmm.... beer, pizza, pretzels, nuts and buzzed chatting about stuff. Despite being on the expensive side, I've come to the conclusion that I'm liking the Ale House more. Of course the fact that they played The Offspring's "Spare Me The Details" and Bad Religion's "Recipe for Hate" last night probably boosted my impression of the place.  I have to write 12 pages by Monday... whoo! Yea I didn't get anything done the past few days.  ***
