The choir unexpectedly got second placed, beating out LN's Hip Street, which usuallly dominates. We also unexpectedly got best back up band, along with Central Sound's band getting best backup band. This means an LC backup band sweep. Huzzah!! Nathan's Concert Choir was screwed out of victory. How did the judges not choose a choir that sings a part in French? On to my rockin' new hat. It is a nifty hat that is used for the German reenacting unit that Marten and I do. It is blue and yellow and looks like those hats that people used to wear with pajamas. If you have further interest, search for fatigue cap on your internet browser. Yay Thomas posted. Does this mean hat of shame revocation?  That's Adorable! Justice makes it giggle!
