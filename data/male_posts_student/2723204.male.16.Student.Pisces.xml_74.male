Untitled     As dawn breaks after the lonely night. Nature’s doing, or is it? The feeling inside I did not fight,  As I remembered the times when the sun shone so very bright. As the sun set, and the darkness grew,  I felt like a fool, because I thought I knew, But now as the darkness clears my head. I realized the sun can never shine all day.  As I remembered the bygone sunshine,  And monochrome images sped through my head. I realized that dawn has broken, Illuminating meadows looking so sullen. As the weeds grow among the flowers,  Dereliction making the land go sour. For under nature’s whim, all living beings cower, But the weeds stands strong, not afraid of being devoured.  Hands bleeding as the farmer toils While the sharp weeds, he removes from the soil. Cherishing a hidden hope, of the flowers which yesterday bloomed. But who knows the flowers which belonged to yesterday, Would today turn to weeds and meet its doom.
