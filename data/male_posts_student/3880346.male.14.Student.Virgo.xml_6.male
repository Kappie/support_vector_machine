While I unfortunately lost the last match to Clifford Tan, I somehow managed to tyco Joash Ee again! I mean, I have the same kind of negative relationship wif clifford as Joash does wif me...I seem doomed to lose to clifford but beat joash...Anyway, even beta den tt was tt suz managed to draw i leong! Cool rite! And solomon's mum treated me to bowling! At first I was very scared and nervous one...but amazingly tyco. I suppose beginner's luck really holds true after all...I managed to get a strike in the very first ball!! and in the end I got 94 points! woohoo! bowling is so much fun! But solomon is even more pro lor, despite (probably purposely) getting 0 in the first frame, he managed to get 122 points! Pro rite...However, when I went back to bowl wif timwee later (too overconfident liao) I only got 56 points...nevermind, i only juz started to learn. I muz remember to keep calm, whenever I get too excited I bowl terribly. Good news is, this year inter team is at Safra toa payoh, so i think I can go bowl afterwards too! :) Truly, my cup overfloweth with blessings...I muz remember to thank God for my sucesses, and spur myself on to greater heights! Now i noe why the sports teams always thank God for His guidance and blessing...It is truly awesome! God rox!! hahaha...Oh yah muz remember the BK incident...Gabriel koped BK's phone, then BK was like supa pissed, want to call police, then me and timwee were like persuading him not to, and I called Gabriel up and whatnot...then he settled for bashing up Gabriel. At least me and gabriel seem to be back on speaking terms again..I suppose i also have Him to thank for tt. Still, i dunno whether gab thinks of me as a fren, but I decided it doesn't really matter, i still think of him as my best fren and tt's all that really matters(or am i just deluding myself? Hope not :))
