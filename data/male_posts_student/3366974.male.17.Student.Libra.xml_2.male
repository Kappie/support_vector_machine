By this, he seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril, but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward." -Moby Dick  Well, read some of Moby Dick today. In town today, we finally got some good basketball games going. It was 2v2 to 10, but you had to win by 2. It was 15-15 until Scotty made a 2 pointer to win, so my team lost 17-15. Then we got 3v3 going, and played that for awhile until these two huge kids came, and it was 4v4, and despite my complaints they insisted on being on the same team so I just went along with it. And, just as I had feared and predicted, they anihilated us. I watched my dream utterly shatter before me as they schooled me.
