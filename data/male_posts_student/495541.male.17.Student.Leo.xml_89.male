At the moment, I don't have much of anything to say.  All I have is your typical generalizations about life like... it's hard, it's stressing, it's depressing, it's anything and everything hard.. easy, sad.. happy, evil.. pure, and anything and everything you can think of.  Thoughts like this just drive mad in my mind when I think about life in general.  There are so many 'things' out there to happen, think of, do and the list goes on.  I dunno what I'm trying to say.  I have a lot on my mind and it's stressful.  Song of the moment: "Yellow" by Coldplay  Good night.
