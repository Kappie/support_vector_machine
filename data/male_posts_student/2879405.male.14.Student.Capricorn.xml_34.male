Their Performance were poor. Fielding worse. Throwing is beyond vocabz. But pitching was Passable. In my opinion, thrashing RI is simply easier than last year, since their coach does not really concentrate.      As for Catholic High...i was there expecting some superb plays. But they were just like any strong TeAmZ. Their result against ACSi and FTP suggested something. But it seems that the suggestion was that FTP and ACSi were lousy, not divine Catholic High.      You may say im a spy. 俗语说得好：知已知彼，百战白盛。I was definately there for some reasonz. I also Dressed myself with a white shirt, so that i might blend into the crowd, as a spy. The final score was 14-2 but that does not mean the Catholic High were any stronger than we expected. Ri was a total disappointment.
