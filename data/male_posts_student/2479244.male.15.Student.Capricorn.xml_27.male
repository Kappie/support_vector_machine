I know that they think they do and they feel mature because they discuss cars, sports and alcohol with their megalomaniacal, gluttonous, obnoxious friends, but that says  shit  about who you are. People will always be the same. A frightened, confused little child looking for the hands of mommy, and even then, mommy doesn't know  what  the fuck is going on.   While on the note of immaturity, its such childish, petty bullshit the way these clich√©d, clique alliances work - they will manipulate their friends and convince them that they need to hate a person purely because they do. If you buy into that, you are a fool. A fool without a sense of independance and a sense of opinion, because it is entirely fucked up to hate someone just because your "friend" does. Honor is a dead concept, and so is humility, thanks to people like this. So the next time your friend says "so and so is such a bitch because he/she is a transexual assclown," feel nothing short of  compelled  to disagree with them.   Well, I'm on a roll, so I guess I'll just keep ranting. I really hate people who act out disrespectfully and loudly purely to get attention and a few sold-out laughs. It bothers me a lot because these are people who live under an umbrella of virtually endless greed, and yet they ask for more, more, and still more, as if their cell phones, televisions, food, and everything else in their house isn't enough. Its such a common syndrome in this country anymore that I would love to see how they would act if their fucking mommy and daddy told them that they can't have their 250 dollar allowance.   I also hate trendy band fanboys. I saw a group of kids today sitting around, being loud and annoying, and every single one of those pigs were wearing "Fall Out Boy" shirts and jackets, thinking they are some musically enlightened group of kids who know  what is up.  You know what? They wouldn't know good music if it came up and slapped them across the face, because they wait for MTV and their friends to tell them what is and is not cool. They feel obligated to tell people that they like some generic band because they can't do it any other way. They want to feel like they are original and classy, like they discovered them first. Too bad, hundreds of thousands of sheep got their first, you're just another number.  Fuck this, I'm so irritable I just want to cut off my head.
