I'M TURNING SENILE~!!!!!! I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER HOW OLD I AM~!!!! 2. i guess sometimes we lose track of certain things cos we dun really wanna admit to changes in our lives.........changes like growing older.........think it would be safe to say that most wan to stay young as long as possible........  it's ironic......many teens wanna look more mature cos they wan to be taken seriously (actually cos it's more cool....but let's give the benefit of the doubt here). Older people wan to look younger so they can show that they are as able as the younger ones (actually it's bcos of their vanity but again.....BOTD......benefit of the doubt).  not saying there's anything wrong in the above..........but underneath all of the trying to impress people, trying to project an image..........there lies the same reason...........self fulfillment...........people do all these jus to make themselves feel better abt themselves.............vanity and cool...........to be taken seriously and proving to have age defying abilities........the all boil down to the same thing.............self fulfillment.............  i still think i have senile dementia...........and im gonna end up like my father...........old....absent minded........stubborn...... not bad..........im already stubborn.........that's 1/3 of the way.........
