The same kick hash youth at the church invited me to go with them to a place called Starcadia in Macon tonight and I was siked about it, really truly because I didn't get to go with them Sunday. Well, I was busy with stuff at the time and didn't get details like time or anything and they left before I had a chance to say goodbye. (This is sounding a little petty but I really feel bad about it. 8-)) Well, we came back to the house and I fell asleep in the chair. I awoke around quarter till six and we ate because Mrs. Hunt had to go to choir practice and then we finished around six-thirty and I  then  started worrying about the time. I thought, seven, maybe, so we drove to the church and they were already gone and then we found the time and it was six. So I was screwed and really pissed. I plan on trying to get a hold of Joey tomorrow and tell him what happened because it sucks dude! What happened Monday? Well, not much, but quite a bit. A job that should have taken a mer thirty minutes took three hours. Doing the inventory for the food pantry is a royal pain in the ass, but it is pretty fun. Strange, I know, but it is all numbers and counting boxes and rearranging stuff. Mr. Hunt had some sort of meeting that night so Mrs. Hunt treated me to dinner at the local Long John Silver's. I have never been to a Long John Silver's and I don't think I will ever go again. lol It was an experience and I will leave it at that. The idea was for her to feed me something other then turkey or chicken and when I arrived I decided to get chicken. I had one to many hush puppies and what seemed like every hour I was making a pit stop to the crappier. Then we ran, well drove to JC Penny to place an order for some curtains I believe then we went back to the house and awaited Mr. Hunts arrival. Tuesday was little bit calmer. We woke up and drove to the church to stalk the shelves to get ready for the clients to come to the food pantry to pick up their food that afternoon. That was easy. I listened to Switchfoot blasting from the cd player across the room. It was a rainy day and we didn't think that we were going to have a big crowd so we didn't make up to many sacks ahead of time. We ate Subway, my favorite place besides the Atlanta Bread Company. That was just a useless bit of information for you. Bare with me it's been a long couple of days. Heh. Arrived back at the food pantry in rain. Quickly got re-accounted (sp?) with my favorite group of works at the food panty, and then I became a floater like I always do during the two hours from two to four. When I say I was a floater I mean that I wander around, rearrange stuff in the closet, file folders, carry out stuff, (in the pouring rain which was tight) fell out of my flip-flops, wait that wasn't... um, put together a thing called SNAP bags, talked about my 'Portfolio of Poems' that I made for english class this past year and brought to show Mr. Hunt which he, in turn, took to show one of the top former english teachers in Houston County and she praised it and that felt great, found a lost Mr. Hunt lol, yeah, I was a floater for two hours man. Later that night Mr. Hunt took me to his meeting and then took me for some of the best coffee I have ever had which you can read about in the post from early this morning below. Today, was one of those days. I woke up, hopped in the shower realizing something that I will not say for the world to see but you can IM me and I might tell you, and while in the shower I became an ice cube. Someone in the house (*cough, cough, Mr. Hunt) kept turning on the water in the sinks around the house and made the water in the shower ice cold. I had shampoo in my hair and it went ice cold and I had to trip over myself to move out of the way so I wouldn't get hypothermia. That would be sweet- 'Mike Sheddan, First man to ever get hypothermia while taking a shower.' Got done, went to Kroger to pick up the bread and 'sweets' for the food pantry, brought them to the church, stored them, and then went to the Waffle House. Hate the Waffle House. Hate it, but one of the only decent things about it was that no one around us was smoking a cancer stick. Went to the house and waited till around noon to go back to the church and get in the van to go to the big kahuna food bank in Macon. Filled up the vans with food for the food pantry. I will spear you the boring details of what happened because frankly I might fall asleep if I thought about them again. Demanded to go to  urlLink Joshua Cup  again which was within walking distance of where we were in Macon. We went and I tried a drink called a Mocha Striped. It was  really  good. Drank it all on the way back to the church and then had to take a major piss but then was taken aback by one of the girls from the youth that came to help us unload the van. There were only two so I'll let you decide which one I was checking out. Talked to Joey and Ryan (for some odd ball reason I don't think that is his name) about our band and they remember playing against us because of our hot cymbal chicks. If they only knew how cocky some of them are they might have changed their mind but for the most part I have to agree with them on that one. Then the stuff in the first paragraph took place. Some time passed. Got pretty pissed I missed out on another great opportunity to get away from Mr. Hunt lol and watched some tv and here I am now. I am coming home tomorrow night and I am wishing that my 'vacation' was longer. It sucks but I am looking forward to pre-band camp a week from Monday but I wish I could just either hang out here some more or take a weekend trip somewhere or do something. Oh well. I will say, yes at this point, I wish I was driving. It sorta sucks now but that's the way things happen. How old do you have to be before you can get something pierced? I'll leave you with that question burned in your head as I finish reading the post I just typed and realized that it seems like I am on crack or something because it is simply a bunch of words jumbled together, but, cheers anyway peeps!
