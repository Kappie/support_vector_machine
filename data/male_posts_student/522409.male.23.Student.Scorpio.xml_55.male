I'm pretty sure the person I'm writing this about doesn't read this anymore, so anonymity isn't of the utmost importance.  Anyway, I hate when feelings exist between two people and then over a not awfully long period of time, they cease to exist between those two people and instead one person is left doing all the feeling and the other gets to forget there was anything there.  That's the greatest.  Anyone out there want to not be confusing?  Give me a call at 617-...  Honestly, though, I've gotten more than enough signs this week alone that the person in question isn't meant to be anything more than a friend to me.  So word.  Whatever.  Onward.  To that which was already working in my life anyway... not sure why I let myself get distracted... probably b/c "that which was already working" is out of town.  That'll soon be remedied.  Angst angst angst angst angst... 10 days til I'm on Cape Cod for my third summer with the boys of summer (click the link for Hyannis Sound at left).  And then nothing's allowed to be bad.  Ever.  SBG, IR, whoever else... not gonna mess with my summer.  Hear me?  I feel so assertive.  Ha.  That'll be short-lived.  Alright.  Bed.  Now.
