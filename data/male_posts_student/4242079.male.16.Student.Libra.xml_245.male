I don't think you can just start a relationship by mutually agreeing that you should be in a relationship. A relationship has to be something that grows from a friendship and just sort of evolves to a point when you think about that person enough, and feel enough for that person that there is actually a commitment. And that's my problem right now. As much as I want to be in a long term relationship, I don't know if I'm there emotionally enough for that yet. Last night, I felt so free, for the first time in a long while, there was little holding me back. And that is a good feeling.   I guess there's a few people I need to talk to, huh?    That was a few months ago. And now, now I don't know what I'm doing. Now, I think I'm back at an emotional level for some sort of relationship, and that is all well and fine, but perhaps I've been going about it the wrong way. Perhaps we need to draw that solid line, make that solid distinction between "she's just a friend" and "she's my girlfriend". But then, where is the proper place to draw that line. Have I chosen correctly here, or should this be left for a longer time. Is it better to grow together as friends first (which, might I add, I have tried, and instead of growing together, it's just caused us both to become discouraged and drift apart), or, is it better to dive head-first into some sort of "status" with someone that you hardly know, just because some sort of chemistry feels right. Because you both hate the feeling of being alone. From one extreme to another, I guess.    Let's give this a whirl
