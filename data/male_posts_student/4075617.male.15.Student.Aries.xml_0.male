Now, imagine, something plastic and wet, that everything in the world will want to cling to it when you first open the contact case. I pick it up with one finger, get it to sit right, start to put it in. Low and behold, it hurts when I put it in, so I take it out, clean it again, try again. In the 20 seconds it takes to put in your eye, you spend about 1 minute recleaning the little bitch. Once you get them in, you can enjoy the rest of your day without a problem. Ha. NO. Remember how everything in the world wants to get stuck to your contact? Well, it can, and it will. Now when something gets in your eye it hurts twice as bad, which is very lovely when you don't have your cleaning solution or lens case anywhere near you. Thank goodness for these lovely little creations to help improve vision, what would we do without them.
