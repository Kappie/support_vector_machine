Most every person I know stays cool with me for a while, but slowly and gradually distances themselves, or just flat out stops talking to me all together.  I don't get it, but whatever, I've always kind of been more content sitting at home doing nothing. I don't know why I always try to be so empathetic of other people when they end up turning my sympathy into some kind of manipulative devilry. I don't know what's wrong with me.  But I'm not going to get angry about it. It won't help anything.
