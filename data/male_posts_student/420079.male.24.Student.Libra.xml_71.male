I am still not fully recovered, though, and I have missed more work than I care to think about. The judge told me she didn't know how I got an A in Legal Writing because my briefs are "far too well-written for most legal writing instructors," so that's good, but I don't know if I'm going to ask to use her as a reference because my work output has been about three times slower than it should be. I really hate to blame everything on the mono, but I have just been so sluggish lately and that's the culprit.  I did pretty damn well in my classes (aside from a rogue B-), and I am in a good position for next year. I applied to transfer to a couple schools in the top 15, but odds are slim, as you can imagine. Even if I got accepted though, I really don't know what I would do. I am content here, and I have built a strong base for myself. But then again, if I worked hard at a Top 10 school and did well, I could be in an even BETTER position...  I am so tired I don't know what else to say, so now it is time to rest.
