Just imagine, i took two bloody minutes to subtract 178 from 207! And to make matters worst, i wasnt so sure my answer was correct so i had to covertly check with the computer calculator....goodness.....what a nightmare...  Well yeah anyway, seems like gunbound is acting like a sort of medium to get to know my classmates better, yea i stopped playing gb seriously a long time ago but hey, if it works to my social advantage, why not? And i still do get a slight satisfying feeling when i blast someone to oblivion...in a  sadistic  sort of way...mwahahahahaha  Think from now on i will upload a picture to grace this so very dead blog...yea think i will do just that...and i still dont know whats wrong with the music code...argh screw it.  Gotta go back to yuhua tomorrow morning...gonna pay a visit to both mrs sunil and mdm peng for 2 testimonials...god, i dont know how long it has been since i first requested for my testimonial to be done? *yAWn*  Yeah thats about then..pretty boring blog entry..but hey as i said before, its not like a lot of ppl bother to read this thing so well...yea, don't really give a shit, haha.   Later people.
