I hear there pleas for honest and good men, failing to learn none can be found round these parts or at bars.     in two hours it will be 15 hours since 4 pm where the dogs dance, students twich in their seats knowing another half hour of class lies ahead and a working mother of three, since relieved of paternal support, tries to sneak out of the office in time to pick up children from day care, feed them and take them to ballet while the father lays her out on his desk white thighs seperated and legal pads crumple in their yellow little ways,  and pens the color of blood roll off haphazardly as a heel of her black pumps catch the handle of a coffee mug reading "I'm the boss" are sent careening off a rounded edge and he gets off before getting on a jet to take him to new york city.  i've been reading kerouac again.  can't you tell?
