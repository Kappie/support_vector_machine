So instead, faithful readers, here is my first published SHOT IN THE DARK!   You:  Brown hair, green shirt, reading Coetzee at Little City 3/3.  Me:  brown hair, blue shirt behind you in line.  Loved Disgrace, lost my courage.  Got it back now.   I hate the last line, but I only had 30 words to work with, and I hit 29.  Ending with  coffee  seemed worse at the time, but now it sounds like I have courage because I put a damn Shot in the Dark out there.  Courage would have been walking up to her at the time.    Whatever.  I've wanted to do this for a while now...finally did it!  WOOT!    Syllabus for my class at UKansas is written, and what the hell, here's the reading list:  1)   urlLink Woe is I:  A Grammarphobe's Guide to Better English in Plain English  - Patricia O'Conner 2)   urlLink The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock  - T.S. Elliot 3)  Various poems by  urlLink Langston Hughes ,  urlLink Leonard Cohen ,  urlLink Gertrude Stein  and  urlLink Charles Bukowski  4)   urlLink Hills Like White Elephants  - Ernest Hemingway (yes, it is a poem about abortion, and somehow, this is the only story that I am keeping from last year's reading list) 5)   urlLink The Life  Times of Michael K  - J.M. Coetzee 6)   urlLink Taming of the Shrew  - William Shakespeare 7)   urlLink Ten Things I Hate About You  - Dir. Gil Junger 8)   urlLink Picasso at the Lapin Agile  - Steve Martin 9)   urlLink An Officer  A Gentleman  - Dir. Taylor Hackford 10)  urlLink Lost in Translation  - Dir. Sofia Coppola  Complaints -   *My list is kind of white.  Elliot, Hemingway, Shakespeare...all standard.  Granted, these are works of theirs that won't be read before they start AP English or more likely college, but it's a bit ethnocentric (thus the additions of Langston Hughes, JM Coetzee, and Sofia Coppola) *I would have substituted Fugard's MASTER HAROLD AND THE BOYS, or August Wilson's FENCES as the non-Shakespeare play, but there were no comidies other than Taming of the Shrew, and since it's Shakespeare, it's likely that much of the funny will be missed.  Everything else is drama.   *One world author in Coetzee, and he's white and went to school in Texas.  Granted, he writes about a black man in post-apartheid Africa, but it's a concern.    It's funny that Michael Savage and David Horowitz bemoan the liberal bias in schools...here I am trying to diversify my curriculum, and I'm as liberal as they come.  I chose five poets of different cultures and times that aren't dry and boring (Elliot is modernism, Stein is the first poststructuralist woman poet really, Hughes is Harlem Renaissance, Cohen is beat, and Bukowski is, well, Bukowski...the poet most of them emulate without knowing it), the most prolific writer of the 20th Century, probably the most decorated author of the past 20 years (Coetzee), Shakespeare, one of the great comedians of the last 20 years, the film that exemplifies traditional structure beyond any other, and the film that exemplifies structure yet somehow subverts it all (Lost in Translation).  My book is a grammar book that is very easy and enjoyable to read.  I wonder what choices they would make.  Probably JULIUS CAESAR, which has more sexuality than most Shakespeare, but somehow they don't expect kids to see homoeroticism.
