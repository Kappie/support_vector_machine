It's some-odd time in the morning, I have some serious iced coffee running through my veins, I just got through a long day of tiny cousins and loud idiots, and I'm dazed to a point where I thought of seeing the Scooby-Doo movie.    DISCLAIMER: Anything said at a time like this has nothing to do with the conscious thoughts of one Nicholas J. Sanz-Gould in any way, shape, or form, in this world or another regardless of how you know the afformentioned person.  All names mentioned have not been changed.  Screw the innocent.  Thank you.  Vanilla Coke???  What?????  Why???????  I like root beer floats and even sometimes coke floats, but this is just stupid.  People, we have to do something.  There isn't any vanilla in this at all!!!!!!  I couldn't taste anything different in it either.  I went home and put some vanilla ice cream in it...    Will someone tell me what happened to Billy Bob Thornton?  He had the movie with Bruce Willis (who's also missing...) and then he just went away.  Someone scan Arkansas for a 6x8 shack in the middle of nowhere.    How can there be a "middle" of nowhere.  If nowhere is a place of nothing, isn't every area the middle?    Good night everyone, I hope you folks have a good time.......
