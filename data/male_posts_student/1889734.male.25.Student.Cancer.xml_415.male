I expect to have the first draft complete within 5 weeks.  At that point, the rewrite begins.  I am seeking help, and I will accept it from any who offer.  I will be working towards a goal of 1,000 words each calendar day in the rewrite process.  I need readers who can absorb my daily output, read it thoroughly, and provide thoughtful, constructive criticism.  Those critics must also be prepared to accept the idea that I might ignore their critiques in favor of my own judgment.  I need replies quickly as I work through this project, and I hope to produce material just as quickly.  To those that help, I can offer little more than my appreciation, and perhaps a mention in print should I ever get lucky enough to make it.  If you are interested, let me know.  I believe Steve and Mark have already agreed, but Iâ€™ll take anyone else who can help.
