Although, I have to admit, its quite a deal more interesting when you're the more vocal type in these kinds of meetings-not for the faint of heart, really. The Great Hall wasn't packed, but there were enough people to make the average person feel a little out of place.  Anyhow, I think I spoke for the majority, if not all of MSA's music department members on this: 1. There is a vast amount of interest in expanding the music department of MSA, as it is a very much alive program and continues to grow every year. 2. Each year more people join the band/music program at MSA, and we need more space. 3. On the lack of space issue...I vouched for a more complete percussion section. That includes marimba (Hana says we need one, so that means we get one), a set of 4 timpani, and a full-concert grand piano *salivates*. Damn would I love to have one of those... 4. I also felt that I spoke again for the whole music department at MSA in sayin that a new auditorium would GREATLY improve the sound qualities of our bands. The accoustics in the Great Hall are horrendous, and a new auditorium with sound panels and accoustically sound design would really improve the program, attract more students towards that program, and even attract more students into MSA itself.  To reiterate in a few words: it'd help the sound. Dan Menssen gave a little speech on the great interest of the 10th grade, mainly the english class, and about the details of having/not wanting to have to chose arts and humanities OR math and science. I'm a little wary on having to make that choice too, however. I'm very much so interested in the music department, and they need me. Plus I like theater, and I plan to be in a few productions before I graduate from MSA. Even yet, I do well in math and science, and I need those classes to pursue my career as a mechanical engineer. That is, unless I end up as a full-time musician, which is very possible.  In other words, I gave a little speech too. I actually enjoy speaking to large numbers of people, oddly enough. And I haven't ever had any speech training-not even that stupid speech elective that I get to skip because of good ol' band.  Anyhow, that was my afterschool stuff.  As for the school day...:  Math: I think I tested fairly well on chapter 11. Then again, I'm usually a pretty good tester, and unlike some people I know (Saali), rarely study.  Band: ate food, drank diet Coke, finished Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and started Bruce Almight. I saw that one on opening night, and it just made me think even higher of Jim Carrey. I don't know how he can be so dang funny sometimes...  English: did crap, had a fire drill, ask Jamie.  Yeah...thats pretty much all for now. No lyrics this time, and I won't have time tonight to update Will's blog, so pester him to do it.
