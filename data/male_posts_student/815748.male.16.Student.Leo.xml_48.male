To the Department of Transportation:  A concerned citizen, I am woed by the amount of injuries and fatalities caused by alcohol-related driving accidents in the United States. My proposal: to incorporate Breathalyzers® into new cars that would not allow themselves to be started if the driver's blood-alcohol level were too high. The technology would be simple, so it would not be a gargantuan task to regulate the instruments' gradual addition over the next few years or decade. For my argument, I present the following syllogism:  1. In 2002, 14,480 people were killed in alcohol-related crashes (source: National Center for Statistics and Analysis).  2. A Breathalyzer®-integrated car would inhibit most drunken people from driving a car.  3. The aforementioned proposal would prevent most alcohol-related fatalities.  Yes, expense would be expended, but a little money would go a long way in preventing tens of thousands of deaths every year. Please study this proposal for those future victims.  I appreciate the work of your organization, and thank you for your time and attention.   Sincerely,  Alexander Dietz  Sophomore, Newton North High School  Newton, Massachusetts
