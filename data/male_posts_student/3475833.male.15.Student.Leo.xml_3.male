Lol. She came to her senses in the end tho. She was cool. Played DDR for my first time. Mucho fun. I think I might have to go buy it. Probably not new though, get it from the fat people who couldn't handle the exercise. Played pool, of course, won a few times. Good times all around.  Now to the serious part. I am really gonna miss Amy, and Erica for that matter. I didn't know Erica all to well, but I did know her. And she's a great person. I'm glad I got to know her. And Amy.. I'm gonna miss her so much. I will miss seeing her after school, at band (if I stay in). I'm gonna miss her so much. We've been through so much, and I've really gotten to know her this year. I wish it woulda started sooner, but hey. It's been good.  After the grad party, Matt and I headed back over to Amanda's. She wasn't there. Oh well, got to meet her aunt and uncle, and her dad. That's a fun family. We stayed for about 20-30 minutes, then headed back home. Nothing to do there, so I headed to bed.  Today, I got up and went to drums, not before I noticed I didn't practice all week, and my stuff was in my mom's car. So I lounged around and waited for her to show up. Luckily, she did and everything was fine. I didn't do as bad as I thought I would. That's always good. Loo.  Then I came home and did ABSOLUTLY nothing. I sat around and read the whole time, until now. Which, after I finish this, I'm going to do again. I need food too, though. Oh well. One thing at a time, I'll see when dinner is first.  So, I've made it to the end. Alyssa isn't on and Sarah just logged off... But, now Brad wants me to come to Frankie's. Which I don't particually want to do. I'd like to get some sleep today, and I have to help my parents set up the pool. I'm just gonna end this rambling now, and stop with the play by play.
