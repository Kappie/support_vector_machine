I'm very pleased that each post has it's own page now. Makes things all so much more neater and easier to implement other pages with the same layout. But that means I'll have to go back through all of them to correct some layout problems. Irratic font sizes seem to be the major problem at the moment. I'll have to dig through the style sheets to figure out why it's happening.  Of course I'll still have to put up all the links that I used to have on the old layout. That will be the next item to be added soon.  So tell me what you think of the new layout and test out the new comments system while you're at it.
