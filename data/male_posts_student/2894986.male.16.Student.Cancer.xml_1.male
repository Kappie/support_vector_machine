First I'll list them, then explain them.  1) Visit to the new movie theater. 2) Eating a four o'clock...at Bob Evans. 3) A 'W' for my intramural team.  1) Yes, we have a new movie theater. No longer will we have to drive down Hurstbourne Lane for half an hour to see a movie or go to that hell-hole they call Showcase Cinemas Louisville. We have a new home for movies: Showcase Cinemas 16 Super De Lux located just off the Preston exit of the Gene Snyder. 'Our' movie theater has two entrances (beat that Stonybrook) and 3 eateries located in the building + Starbucks. But unlike Stonybrook, it is eat there or don't eat. No restaurants in walking distance here. Hopefully they'll build a Steak and Shake next door soon. The theater itself is pretty nice, including a self playing piano in the lobby. (Why? IDK.) The seats are REALLY comfortable though. High backs and head rests. And armrests that lift up if you feel the need to take a nap during the movie. Or maybe its for fat people...this we may never know.   2) Ever eaten at 4 o'clock? Well me neither. Atleast that was the case until saturday at...well 4 pm. Ever eaten at Bob Evans for dinner. We me neither. Wait....I also did that Saturday. Ever been the only group at resteraunt. Well me neither.....and again that changed Saturday. On a trip to eat for my granparents anniversary, I accomplished all of these feats at once. To my surprise the food was actually pretty good. But never again will I go to eat at 4 o'clock. I've learned my lesson.  3) Yes, you read correctly.. put a big 'W' on the board for intramural team number 14. In a thirilling 25-22 nailbiter, my team pulled out its first victory of the season only trailing at one time...2-0. The teams best player...(hint: me) scored 5 pivotal points. The championship run has begun and there is not stopping until we have our championship. Or until we lose. Which ever comes first. But does it even matter anymore? No, we have our win and we aren't the worst team anymore. There are still two teams with no wins. So to all you doubters......you're probably still right; it was probably a fluke.   Also, St.X has found a new principal. Good luck putting up with Perry, Mr. Nunn. You will surely need it.   Watch the lamb, we don't want him to get away.
