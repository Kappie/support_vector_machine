I was always a David Jones man, but I still liked going to Grace Brothers. They had nice christmas decorations and funky clothes. But now where there was Grace Brothers there is Myer. For one thing theiur logo looks like they are trying too hard to be David Jones. Well not really. But I liked the old Grace Bros. logo. It was red, a very bold choice for a high end company, but the flower symbolised the australianess of the company and simply haveing "bros" in their name showed how they were family oriented. David jones what the up market for snooty people store and grace brothers was for the upmarket normal people, or atleast thats how it looked to me. Myer.. what the fuck is a myer?! It's for letters and doesnt end with a "S" it doesnt even sound normal. And that font, it's pugly. It's like they're just flushing all the branding efforts down the toilet. I didnt even see any "Grace bros is now myer, same company different name" or "Same store, same quality your used to but now a different name. Myer" No. Now it seems like a hostile takeover where the grace family was muscled out of their business.  Brands are recorded in peoples brains in a similar way that friends are. It feels like Myers just murdered one of my acquantances.
