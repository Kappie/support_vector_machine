The author Daniel Quinn utilizes a neat literary trick to achieve a view of the human race from the outside.  Rarely has a book made me sit up and pay attention like  Ishmael  did.  The second book is more of the same, so the impact is a little blunted by the prior experience, but it is no less valuable as a tool for cutting through so much of the bullshit that humanity surrounds itself with.  If you haven't read  Ishmael  yet, you need to.  Right now.    urlLink Link
