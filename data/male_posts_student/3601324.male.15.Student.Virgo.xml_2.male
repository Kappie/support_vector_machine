The book was waaay better (shut up). I think this book was my favorite of the series. The movie's probably my favorite too, but it left a whole lot of important details out.  So after that, I went and bought some stuff with my newly earned money. A cheap digital camera. It's nothing special, but it was only $20, so I got what I paid for. ;) And also, I bought a DVD player. It was about damn time, really. My family has never purchased one before this, so we've been really deprived of the new craze that is DVD's. Yay! Now I can watch alot more anime n' such.  By this point I reeeally need to make some Oddities comics, but tomorrow's not looking good. I think I'm going over to Ian's house. I'll  really  try to get caught up later though.
