I dont know why my mood in the previous post was so crap for crap.  I took some time to think and clear my mind and now everything should be back to normal.  Kassandra left me all alone so I guess it means it's close to brief hibernation (sleep).  Well, rest on a settled mind is always good.  Hopefully Kassandra wont be busy tomorrow and maybe I can hang out with her at her place.  That'd be cool.  Well, peace.
