Becoz Weichong had some chemistry stuff to ask him. Cant really hear him properly. I think that kinda of irritated him. Yeah. Said some mean stuff to me. He mentioned that i was rude to him during civics lesson. And he was kinda of pissed. But din want to tell me what i said. -.-" I guess it's when he asked for comments for chemistry lessons. Then I told him we wanted a younger and more handsome teacher. It was meant to be a joke? Just wanna say sorry if I hurted him.  Anyway, i finished up my maths A8. And i went home to sleep. Had some deep thoughts... Perhaps God is just throwing Mr Suren at me to draw me back to Him. Ummz.  Gonna do some hmwk~ Adios.
