Eventhough the response from Class 6 was abysmal, those ten kids who came   played much better than expected.  Let's cut to the chase. The results are (in order of winning):      urlLink Suvansh Vedi    urlLink Bhavani Shankar Bhandari    urlLink Anirban Sarkar     The aim was to get 50 frags first.  Class VII is next on Friday,  --Karan  Big PS:  I just forgot to mention the names of the organisers in the entry, and as you can guess, without them this event would have been nothing at all. Quite a handful of people turned up to help. Here are the names of the Domain Square members who organised the event:     Manas Gautam (IX)  Srajan Mani Rastogi (IX)  Rasagy Sharma (X)  Souvik Das Gupta (XII)   Special thanks go to Siddharth Sinha (XII-I) who helped immensely during the event, just as much, or more than some of the Domain Square members.
