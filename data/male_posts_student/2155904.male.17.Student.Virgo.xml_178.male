And when Tyke has a streak going like he has, there is no chance of him not blogging for a stupid reason like this.  Commercial break...1st period, Tyke didn't do his math homework for like the first time in a long time.  He usually just makes up answers so that's why he does it but still he didn't even do that this time.  But of course he was able to do it while class was going on so once again he sneaks by without being caught.  But man is she ever a bitch!  In 4th period Tyke actually talked with Senyohl one-on-one for perhaps the first time ever.  He has lately been wanting to go on the Ashland trip so he talked to her about that and she said she'd put him "on the top of the list" so he very well might get to go.  That would be fun.  Hanging out with Purdy, Dotti, and Amed for a fun week away from school.  Definitely a good time could be had.  After school Tyke and Purdy were both going to the baseball game and neither of them had anything to do so they went out to Subway together and grabbed a bite to eat.  They sat out on the curb in the sun and chatted about things that they had in common (which are plenty) as well as kids and such.  Then they went back to the school where Tyke dropped her off and went home for a little.  He changed and then went back out to Jamba where he met up with Skippy.  Let's just say that when you are a guy and you get a femme boost, you get some strange looks.  And telling the lady that your name is "Tyke" doesn't really make it any more normal.  But hey, that's the beauty of being Tyke.  You just don't care.  It's all about the comedy.  The two went to the baseball game at IHS after getting their juice and since Tyke had forgotten that the new exit getting on the freeway by Gilman only goes east he took Skippy on a nice detour all the way out to Highpoint before turning around to go to school.  It was cool though.  Tyke talked with a bunch of people at the baseball game.  Ekul, Skippy, Purdy, Tina, Haras, Dudely Doo, Tig, Karla, Triple Threat, Mandy, Amyazing, and others.  But that was a very fun social event and Tyke got Ekul to play basketball against Tyke, Kinker, and HoChyt on Saturday.  Saturday is going to be a busy day for sure.  For sure.  After the game Tyke went over to McDonald's and picked up dinner for him and his dad.  Then he came back home and put together this electronic dartboard that Tyke's dad got for his 10 years of service at Boeing.  Which is funny just cuz he has worked there for about 20 years total but in different stints.  Then he went down to Chevron to get gas and then to Baskin Robbins with Amed for free ice cream.  Gas is very expensive.  It cost Tyke about 5 dollars more than it usually cost him back when prices were pretty steady.  Then came BR.  The line outside there was insanely long.  So Amed and Tyke decided that they were not going to wait in that damn line for so long all to get the equivalent of a $1.63 scoop of ice cream.  Tyke's mom called him at that point telling him to get 10 newspapers that had the obituary of his grandpa in it so he went to QFC and cleared them out.  Then he went to Starbucks and cleared them out.  Then he still didn't have enough so he went to one of those stands outside Issaquah Cafe and they put in the money to open it up but there was only one actually in there so they just stole the display one as well.  It was fun to do.  Dr. Phil was working at BR but since he got really lucky and hardly had to do any work on their most busy of days he went outside and talked with Tyke and Amed for a little bit.  It was a very pleasant night out which made it more enjoyable.  Then Tyke came home and watched the OC.  The season finale should hopefully be very good next week.  That show has so many good looking people on it.  It's just insane.  Oh, and Tyke's going to be a stripper if his sports anchor job doesn't pan out.  Just so that you know.  A very hot stripper.  Private parties only.  *wink.  *other eye wink.  *shimmy dance (ya know the one where you put your arms just below your nipples and bend the elbow and then you bend your knees a little and shake your booty and arms).  If you don't know just ask Tyke and he'll do it.  Tyke and Purdy were doing it in Physics yesterday so that is what he means.  Physics, the class where only Purdy laughs at his jokes.
