Every color looks grey, gravity feels bigger, the sky is lower, I don't know the sun bored.Yeargh.  Got up at 2 am this morning and couldn't get back to sleep. Stayed up and watched spiderman2 instead.*sips coffee*Now I'm at work and have absolutely nothing to do but type this on one o' them fancy er-go-nomical keyboards. 8 minutes until I have to change the Cds again.   Umm. umm. Gotta think about something. Made an LJ account just because everyone else has one and I'm a conformist pussy. Yeah. Wanna syndacate this blog over there, hafta see howda do that.
