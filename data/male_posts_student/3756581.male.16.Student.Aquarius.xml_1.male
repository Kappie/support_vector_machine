I don't mean to sound harsh, but it's the truth...something the Left has a very hard time seeing. Why is the Left so angry and hateful when it comes to this war? Why do they scream and chant "FREE PALASTINE!!!" and yet don't want the people if Iraq to be free? Let me tell you folks something about The Left: They hate America...not just the government, not just The Right, not just Bush...but ALL of America. They hate the people, as Michael Moore made evident when he said that "Americans were the dumbest people on the planet." They claim to want Freedom, yet their entire platform is based on MORE governmental intervention. They say they want Freedom of speech, that they respect everyone as an individual...all I have to say about this is Bullsh**. The Left only wants Free speech when it benifits them and there opinions. Don't believe me? Take a look at the Protest Warrior Videos over at www.protestwarrior.com, paticularly Operation: Wolverines. After watching their videos, you will have a whole new idea of The Left. No longer will they come across as the "compassionate" ones, or the "peace loving" ones.  Another thing about The Left you should know is that they think you are too dumb, and too ignorant to do anything on your own. If they could have it there way, we'd have people telling us what to wear, where to go, what to say, when to say it, and HOW to say it. What political ideology does The Left hold very near and dear to there hearts? Ever here of a little thing called Communism? You know, when political opposition is squashed, and anyone who thinks differently then the State is automatically exterminated? Thats what The Left wants for America.   Equality is one thing The Left really likes to play on, they say that if you come to their side, everyone will be equal. This is true, if you really think about it. If a hardcore Leftist, such as John Kerry, were to win the presidency, we would all be EQUALLY poor and miserable. Equality, ain't it great! Leftists are not out to help you, they are out to make you into their little puppets, they want to OWN you, they want to OWN your mind. They don't give a squat about individuallity, because individuallity means you have to think on your own, and thats not good for a Leftist leader. They want you to Comform, they want you to blend in, they don't want people, they want numbers, statistics.  When you get right down to it, The Left hates you, America, and the world for that matter. They want nothing more then to make you there own personal slaves. There is this thing, called the Constitution, maybe you've heard of it, and it says that every person has the right to Life, Liberty and the Prusuit of Happiness. I like to switch this around a little bit, and this is the Motto of the site, Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit to Leftists who threaten them!
