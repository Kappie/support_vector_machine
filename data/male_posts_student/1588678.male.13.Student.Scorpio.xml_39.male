The First Opening Band - Well, ehhh, didn’t see them. Quite frankly, I didn’t wanna see them. So, uhhh, they might have been a kick-ass band or just plane crap. Who knows?  The Wallflowers - Oh my God! They were real good! We got there just before they started and lemme tell ya, they were fantastic! I never really got into the Wallflowers, don’t know why, but after that concert they sure as hell proved their worthiness to me. Jacob Dylan, whata nice guy. In between songs he’d stop and have a little chat with the crowd. That’s cool. Lemme tell you that he looks and has that voice like his dad, Bob Dylan. Oh yeah, very good drummer. The dude looked just like Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters, but it wasn’t.  The Counting Crow - UN FRIGGIN’ BELIEVEABLE!!!!! They’re so damn good it almost scares you! That Adam guy is so cool! The whole concert he was barefoot. And at the beginning of the concert he said, “If we don’t play a long enough set, don’t worry. We’re gonna come out again with a couple of friends. Believe me, the encores will be motherfucker!” Every song was great! They played all their good songs like Mr. Jones, Rain King, and Long December. In fact, when he played Long December on the piano he stopped at like the second or third chorus and said, “I fucked up, lemme try it again.” And to agree with Adam, the encores were motherfucker. For the encore Adam had the Wallflowers and the other band come out and they all played together. It was awesome!   My Grade - The first opening band, well . . . Uhhh N/A. From what I herd they were good, but they may think AFI’s good so, yeah.  The Wallflowers - ****½. They were real good. I may consider buying one of their albums now. The Counting Crows - *****! They were awesome!!! Next time they’re around here I’m gonna see them. You should too.  P.S. - They’re new Best of CD is tight. Ask for it for Christmas. It is the perfect Christmas present to receive my friend.
