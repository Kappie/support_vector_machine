I'm totally new to the whole blogging scene, in fact, I only know about it from an article I read in Times magazine, and I was interested immediatley.  It talked about amateur journalism, and the affect blogs had on "real" new corporations, so I thought I'd check it out and see what it's all about.  I play ice hockey, I play soccer recreationally, not on a team, and I love to watch international soccer, my favorite team being Team Netherlands.  I will be a junior in high school, and this is my blog, where I will proceed to post whatever I feel like, and say whatever I want, isn't that what blogs area all about anyway? I hope at least some of you enjoy.
