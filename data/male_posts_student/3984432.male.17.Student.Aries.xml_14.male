We've "quarrelled" about this blog already (thats why we both have a post explaining what this is all about) and you can also respond to what we think by clicking on the bottom of our entry and putting your opinion. That is unless one of us decides not to let you comment on it. But I doubt I'll do that, nor will my co-author Corey.   I hope you enjoy reading this as much as we'll enjoy writing it. And don't forget to give us your own opinion in the process!   Stay tuned for more of my left-winged thoughts!
