Same with that new spiderman 2 movie, it's gonna be tight. All these good movies are coming out this summer!I'm in my math period right now, though i'm skipping it! ha. Sorry but all we are doing right now is reviewing for the TAKS test, and thats boring! So i got my 3rd period teacher to write me a pass to do what i'm doing right now, so it wont count against my attendence, cause i still gotta exempt my final exams! And since i read and did all the work stuff last night, i did the quiz and it seemed pretty easy, the Great Gatsby is actually a good book but its kinda slow in the beginning of chapter one and all through chapter six. I missed like 1 questions on the quiz, SO I BETTER GET AN A! and lunch is in 5 minutes, no its in 8. well same thing. Now i understand why anthony does this bloggy thingy, you can vent into it, THIS IS TIGHT! hahaha sorry, easily amused. Tonight is traing with Dragon, Tiger, Agent Smith, Sagat, Gohan and the girls. I'm not gonna spar! at least not today... well hopefully. If you dont know who sagat is ill tell u tonight! I think i'm gonna chang my bloggy template. And i have to do my power point presentation tonight, So ill try to get it done before we go to train tonight. I wonder if Tiger has enough wind to train tonight...? ah well guess ill see later. aight people, lats!
