And its the beginning of another two week (or more) countdown - some of you know what im talking about.  And Brandon - you know you should kick that smoking habit - it makes you look fat. Get back with the cool stuff man - the hard stuff. Like sticks and stones.  -mikeo  Is it bad if my best photo ever makes me quote "Look like a stoner"?   "To make the queen of the angels sigh"             -The Doors
