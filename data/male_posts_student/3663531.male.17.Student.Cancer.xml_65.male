Of course there are some aspects that make it much more bearable, but as we all know, good things tend to dissolve under the constant pressure of monotonous mindnumbing situations. Kind of like how diamonds are made!  For one, there is too many little freaks. I hate them. Then, you get in trouble for wielding a length of lead pipe!  Pah, they don't understand progress...
