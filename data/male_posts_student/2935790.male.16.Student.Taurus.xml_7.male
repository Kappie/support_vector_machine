Civics  = important, depending on your future  career , which you don't need an  ENTIRE  half a semester to stress over.  Remember those people, down in the office?  The ones who you can make appointments with to help direct your future?  Yes people, they still exist, and trust me, they're helpful.  Careers, however, is a load of hooey.  We watched a movie in "careers" about the top ten jobs, I'm soooo glad we did!  If it wasn't for that movie I would be completely oblivious to the world of  Sand Sculpting , and lets not forget  Food Critic !  What would we do without amazing educational videos like that?  With 90% of the cource being common knowledge, the boredom sets in.  This class must have dropped my I.Q. by like a trillion [ joke, I'm not stupid ].  Oh, lets not forget our E.Q.!  'Cause your future doesn't depend on a silly thing like math, no no, it depends on your Emotional Quotient.  The only think that class is good for is reminding smart kids they are smart, and giving leaving dumb kids open to ridicule.  This class is easy, unless of course your teacher is a gym teacher.  Sure, he is a wicked guy, I bet he's very smart too, but why can't you just let the guy teach gym?  I complain about careers SO much that the teacher is just failing me on purpose by now, an excellent opportunity for me to grab some evidence that I'm wasting my time in this class, I bet my mom would love to see a teacher who is ACTUALLY doing their job wrong.  For once, the 'dumb 15-year-old' is right.  To quote Rob, "Careers should be optional, and civics should be a full course, and you should have a choice, too."  Of course I cleared up some grammar :P but he has a sweet-ass point.  Good luck getting through the course, try to ignore the inevitable anhedonia you will soon be fond of.  OMG CIAO LOLZ!!!!111, Sean
