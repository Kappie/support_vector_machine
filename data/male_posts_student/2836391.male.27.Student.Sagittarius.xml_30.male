We all really enjoyed it, although we felt that one of the actors was not right for the part he was in. Of course, we couldn't actually think of anyone better, but we just had that feeling he wasn't right. Everyone's a critic I guess! Other than that we really enjoyed it, and had a good time.  After the movie a few of us wandered around the mall, and I actually did some clothes shopping. Now, normally I hate clothes shopping, and in fact any shopping in general. On the rare occasions I do shop for clothes myself, I work out what I want, where to get it, and I go in fast and get out. But one of my friends needed to get a jersey, and the girls decided to give him some advice. Even though I hadn't been intending to buy anything, I ended up taking the opportunity for some advice. So, I ended up outfitting myself again, and hopefully this will hold me for a while.   urlLink Rach  has asked me to go with her tomorrow to look at a car she is considering buying. Naturally I am relieved that she has finally recognized my vast knowledge of motor vehicle related matters, and is wisely seeking my counsel. Actually though, I know very little about cars, but it is still nice to be asked to give an opinion.  And again, no Tuesday newspaper. Ah well, what can you do?
