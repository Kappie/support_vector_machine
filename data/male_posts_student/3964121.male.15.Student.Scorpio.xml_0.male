My family is in the television room watching Fawlty Towers, which I would love to watch usually, but right now, I would much rather lie down and stare at the ceiling while listening to music (preferably the Amelie soundtrack). I don't know what it is, is it just the random times of the feeling of my heart being torn out? Or is it just me being bored? It can't be the latter. I mean I have the choice of sitting around and watching brilliant comedy. No and it's not the former, which is just an idiotic cliché. So what can it be? Is it emptiness? Or is it a phase of a day in which you look upon the sad pathetic life you have and wonder whether it will continue to be this way. I suggest, if you enjoy wallowing in your own self pity, or you just like sad beautiful songs, that you listen to  Comptine d'une autre été: L'apres-midi.  It's on the Amelie soundtrack and it is a beautiful song, along with the rest of the CD. That is all. The Protagonist is out.
