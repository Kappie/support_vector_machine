I volunteered to be a leader there this week. So I get there, and one person younger than me who also was voluteering like tried to tell me what to do. Well Ellan, I'm sorry but you aren't allmighty. And no, I wasn't going to go into the gym then, or anytime. Don't tell me what to do. K? :-) So I got my group, which is a really cool group by the way. Then we sang songs and danced. You can imagine how that was. But! I had Natelie become my co-leader for the day because she was a volunteer there and had no group. So she joined mine. So me and Natelie went around with our group and when they were in there little session things we went down and got a drink. Then there was more, dancing. And stail ice cream cones. They were nasty Natelie, along with the Kool-aid. Then there was more singing and dancing. Then we went home. Once I got there I just kinda hung out until 2:30 and then I walked up to the pool and swam for a little. Not long though probably only about 10 minutes at the most. It was packed, so I wasn't a big fan of that. And there were also these obnoxious 8 year olds that were annoying me because they think they were cool. Well I put an end to that quick. I got home and layed outside for about 10 minutes and then KLT called and asked if I wanted to go to Hollands with her and Haley. So I went and we stayed there for about an hour and 15 minutes, until I found a hair in the popcorn and ran outside. I almost threw up. It was really really nasty. I went home and my parents had dinner ready. So I ate and then just went outside or stayed inside, what ever I felt like every 10 minutes. It changed alot. But just about 10 minutes ago, I was walking outside and it was dark, and this car kept driving by me, I even saw him turn around in the pool parking lot and drive past me twice! I was pretty freaked out. So I walked home really fast. and I mean really fast. Then I got inside and now I'm writing this. For Love or For Money is on. Let me tell you girls, you are morons if you don't pick a million dollars. If you pick "love" from a guy you have only met like 10 times for about 15 minutes each, over 1,000,000 dollars. You are the studest person ever. Well, I have to get up early again tomorrow. I wonder how everyone is doing who went on the Kings Island trip. That was way to early to get up and get home for me to go. Well, I'm gonna go get some food. Later.
