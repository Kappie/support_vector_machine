Canon in D One Last Breath the way she smells the way her hair smells the stars at night. the old field behind the school. warm summer nights.  well, i guess everything is over now. no, i am just saying that in the hopes that it will be over. its hard to accept, but i cant have her.  i am just another guy in love with her. crappy deal.  what can i do.  ill live as though none of it happened?... well i suppose i shouldve seen it all coming. ill end this one there...
