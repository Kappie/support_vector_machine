Darn! Desmond and I got to check the second floor again. It was terrible I tell you,  knock  my forehead once into a beam while reading out the part number to Desmond and walking. And  AGAIN , the back of my head while I backtrack. If u think it ends here, you are so damn wrong.  Hit  the back of my neck into another beam as I tried to get to the very top by stepping on the shelves. Amos had to irritate me and made me  ram  my spine right into what seems to be a car door which was sticking out. Lucky for me to have survive hell (second floor) and walk away scratchless with no signs of concussion.   errrmmmm... Hungry sia... Will continue to blog later...  B e  R ight  B ack
