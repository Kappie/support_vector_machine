Now I get to my first programming II class, I've been removed from the roster. Apparently I failed Calculus, so I'm being told. How is it everyone else got their schedules right, yet I was led to believe I was advancing!!! And of course the school website still hasn't even updated its database with my Calculus grade. I must have really screwed up my final exam to have failed the class.
