Amanda got a cool necklace. :)CQ got a bottle of Ice Lemon Tea along with a card of note! That note is of particular interest!! It says something about choir instructor giving us that card (the card accompanied by the note is similar to the one miss choo gave us) , about treasuring friendship. The note's so sweet! Ahh! We guessed it is either a non-choir member, or a choir member pretending to be a non-choir member. With makes the guess useless, since it includes everybody. HaHa! CQ keep guessing it's me, and keeps asking Hann when I was ever out of his sight today (I was with him throughout the day today!). I think it's XX and YY, due to the fact that both of them knows he likes ILT, especially YY. But!! The colour of the words makes it XX. Me and Amanda made a bet. She guessed XX, I guessed YY. We treat each other drinks. If none of our guesses are correct, then we treat CQ drinks. And no, I am not gonna reveal XX and YY. You try asking Amanda lor.   The second major event is that there's a major accusation of me liking Wendy. You see ar. Everytime during recess, I would play a silly game with CQ. I would try to spot Bright in the crowd of street-bandy players (I call him Bright Bright! HAHA!). Okay, so today, we four were walking in the parade square. I was saying, "Where's he?" CQ spotted him. Yit Hann was going "Where Who?!". WQ was going "That bastard ar?" three times. (Hello lor! As if you are any better!) Anywhere, YH found out who "he" is. Then, they went on talking about the "affair" between me and Wendy. Come on lor! There's nothing between us!! AYIOH! I gotta go now! I know that this is a major anti-climax. But I gotta go no!! Charmed's about to show! Bye bye!
