Unable to decline the request, the owner of the horse sent it to Kyoto.  On the way a horse thief saw it, desperately wanted it, and decided to steal it by any means.  So he followed it secretly.  But because the soldiers guarding it remained vigilant, the thief didn't have a chance to steal it before they all reached Kyoto.  Upon arriving in the Capital, the horse was first put in Yorinobu's stable.  In no time someone told Yorinobu's son, Yoriyoshi: "A fine horse has arrived at your father's place today from the East." When he heard this, Yoriyoshi thought: It's certain that an unworthy fellow will ask my father for the horse and get it sooner or later.  Before that happens I'll go see it, and if it's a really fine horse, I'll ask for it and get it.  So, even though it was pouring that day and it was already evening, Yoriyoshi, dying to see the horse, went to visit his father through the downpour.  "Well, why haven't you come to see me for such a long time?" the father said to his son.  Even while saying this, he guessed that his son had heard about the arrival of the horse and came with the thought of asking for it.  So, before Yoriyoshi opened his mouth, Yorinobu said, "I've heard that a horse has arrived from the East, but I haven't seen it yet.  The fellow who sent it to me says it's a fine horse.  It's too dark to see anything now.  If you look at it tomorrow morning and like it in any way, it's yours."  Told this before he made the request, Yoriyoshi was greatly pleased, "Well, then, sir" he said, "may I stay overnight, so that I may look at the horse in the morning?"  The two of them spent the evening gossiping.  When the night became late and the father retired to sleep in his bedroom, Yoriyoshi followed suit and lay in a room nearby to sleep.  Meanwhile, it continued to rain noisily.  Around midnight the thief stole in, mingling with the noise of the rain, led the horse out, and left.  Sometime later a cry went up from the direction of the stable : "A thief has taken the horse that arrived last night for the master!"  Yorinobu heard this, though faintly.  Without even asking the sleeping Yoriyoshi, "Did you hear that?" he tucked in the hem of his robe, as a lady would, as he rose to his feet.  He slung a quiver across his back and ran to the stable.  He led out a horse himself and put on it a cheap saddle which was on hand.  He then rode out, alone, toward Osaka Barrier to give chase.  As he did this, he thought, This thief must be a fellow from the East.  He saw it was a fine horse and followed it with the thought of stealing it, but he couldn't do it before reaching Kyoto.  Last night he came in by the noise of the rain and got away with it.  Yoriyoshi also had heard the cry.  He thought exactly as his father did, and didn't tell him, either.  He had gone to sleep in his clothes, so he simply got up, slung a quiver across his back, led out a horse from the stable, and rode out toward the Osaka Barrier to give chase, alone.  The father thought, My son is sure to come on this chase.  The son thought, My father is sure to be ahead of me, giving chase.  He galloped on.  By the time he passed the riverbed, the rain had stopped and the sky had cleared up.  He rode on even faster, until he came near the Osaka Barrier.  The thief, riding the horse he had stolen, thought he'd gotten away with it.  He slowed his hard gallop as he came to the Osaka Barrier and had his horse wade into the ample pool of water that had formed next to it.  When he heard that wading noise, Yorinobu, as if he had planned it with his son beforehand, and even though it was still dark and he didn't even know his son was there, cried out, "Shoot, he's there!"  He had hardly finished saying this when he heard the sound of a flying arrow.  He sensed something was hit.  Then he heard the clanking of empty stirrups as the startled horse broke into a gallop without its rider.  Yorinobu said, "You've shot the thief down! Run ahead and get hold of the horse!" Then, without waiting, he turned back and headed home.  Yoriyoshi ran ahead of the horse and got hold of it.  By then some of Yorinobu's soldiers had caught up, and these met Yoriyoshi on his way back, a few at a time.  By the time he reached Kyoto there were twenty to thirty of them with him.  Yorinobu got back to his mansion and, without even thinking of saying this or that, walked to his bedroom and went back to sleep, Yoriyoshi, too, went back to sleep after putting the horse he had brought back in the care of the grooms.  The following morning, Yorinobu called out Yoriyoshi.  But instead of evincing any knowledge of his son's extraordinary exploits of shooting and bringing back the horse, he simply ordered that the horse be brought out.  When it was, Yoriyoshi looked at it and saw it was a fine horse indeed.  He simply said, "I accept your offer, sir" and took the horse.  The only thing is that, though it hadn't been promised the previous night, the horse came with a fine saddle.  Yoriyoshi decided it was an award for shooting the thief down."
