Well, well, yet another year down, eh?  One more closer to death.  At least this year I can say I usher it in with a girl whom I care about deeply, I hope we stay together.  So I guess my resolution is just not to be so clingy, not to be such a jerk, and to continue to be a better person than everyone else.... well that kind've came out wrong.  I mean, to be a better person than you.  Wait, still wrong.  To better myself by devoting time to work, volunteering, charity, and my friends, even moreso than I do now!  OK WOOOOOOOOOOOT NEW YEAR!
