TIP OF THE DAY : SIM LIM SQUARE - THE CHEAPEST STUFF ARE ALWAYS ON THE LAST TWO STORIES. went to temple around bugis to pray. i had my fortune told for the first time. my wish was to score well in Os. shaked the "chopstick" thing and number 77 came out. it read BAD. so i asked the dudes outside to explain further. paid 10 bucks and he said woah it was really bad, my results will suck. (summarised) he wrote some stuff on a funny piece of paper and asked me to go to another building to pray. there i paid 3 to a woman who chanted a melody of dialects. supposedly to make my luck get better. after which we met up with ryan, went to play cs.(haven played in a looooonnggg time). saw many many many many ahs and cabs. (cab = chao ah beng). met up with the rest of the motley crue and went to catch spidey again heheheh. nice. :D. kel met up with us later cos he had to send his mom off. so we were all tired and shit, but we still went to maxwell to have supper...then dragged our half unconcious bodies back home. here i am. im a little, alright VERY bothered bout the fortune telling stuff. well, guys, if you're reading this - make a post on my tag below, what would you do if you were in my shoes? to believe, or not to believe? - going off to install flight stimulator! yay.  miss spca
