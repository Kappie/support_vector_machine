Yeah, I know that I'm not the greatest colourartist in the world... *drowning in selfpity* The first one is a page from Naruto, scanned and translated by Inane, and I can't remember where I got the second. I really suck at art, especially at Photoshop, but hell, it's fun (have I said these words before? hmm)
