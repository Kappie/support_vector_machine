I promise that this will be my last post today LOL  Just to let you all know that if you would like to visit a website that can create skins, codes, graphics and even give support for various things such as websites, forums etc: then visit my other site called 'Digitalized'.  You can visit the forum by going to http://s4.invisionfree.com/Digitalized  I also have a 'main website', however it is not completed yet so I will not give you all the link yet!  Watch this space for the opening of my website!  Bye!  Stefan
