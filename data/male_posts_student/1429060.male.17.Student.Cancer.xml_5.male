It was not fun. I dunno what sparked it entirely, but it was kind of disturbing and, you know, when your ranting you can get into it and hate it at the same time. I got to one part where I really upset myself, and I think that part should be interesting to post, but beware of the language and the emotions within it.   "...I wanted to cry like I want at Morgan Fox's poem, but I can't. I can't, goddamnit, because I am insensitive. Damn it, I can't feel anything, can I? People laugh and cry and react in ways I can't because I don't understand how. They feel things and I don't know how feel it. Why can't I feel things as an emotion? If someone died I wouldn't do anything...I can't cry or pain or pine or feel like other people unless it's fucking fear. Fear or anger. Mostly fear, which inspires anger. I hate being so fucking different. It's a sickness...I know that I hide it and and I hide all the goddamn emotions but it is still there like a goddamn parasite...I've been lying to myself I think..."   Written late late last night/early this morning, when I fell into the attitude. Won't say why. This did include some other people, and they played a big part in the rest of it. The whole rant theme was about fear. I am excluding those people and references thereof for reasons of my own choosing.  This is why I wanted people to be warned. Yes, I am probably borderline insane, so keep that in mind when reading. It happens and it is going to happen. It's inevitable.  Cheers, humans
