I haven't done this in several years.I had a phone interview last week that (I thought) went very well after spending a nerve-wracking couple of days waiting for the call. I'm a worrier and I overthink everything. I don't want to, but it just happens. I'd love to be Miss Laidback, everything's cool, no worries. But I'm finding that I am just not that way.  The director set up a phoner with me for "sometime Tuesday afternoon or anytime Wednesday." Of course I said I'm available but I wish I would have pushed for a specific time. I'm also maybe a little *too* accomodating. I'm one of those people who will be at your beck and call if I'm needed (in a work situation that is. Don't get any ideas.) So of course I tell her I'm available at her convenience which I've read is not necessarily a good thing. But anyway, I figure it's like picking a jury - it's unpredictable. She may have appreciated me accomodating her, then again maybe she wasn't. See? I'm overthinking it already and it all happened last week.  Anyway, no call on Tuesday and by 4pm Wednesday I'm beginning to panic. What if she hired some else? What if she changed her mind? What doI do if she doesn't call? Do I then have to bother her with a call or email? What if I do that and I end up sounding desperate and annoying? See what I mean? I'm sure I drove poor Cathy (in my office) nuts with my edginess. Thankfully, she called at 4:15 and I figured she was probably just leaving it til the end of the day since she was calling me at work to do this.   The call went well as I said. We talked about the possibilty of moving to another town and whether that would appeal to me. It would if the town were Lincoln or Omaha, but the town she named is crap and I don't want to live there. So she said that was okay, she had positions open here in town as well. Then we went over my experience and what sort of things I'm comfortable working with. She cracked a joke or two, I laughed but kept my joke-making at a minimum. I crack jokes when I'm nervous and they mostly fall flat. Then we set up a time to meet face-to-face and she emailed me the official job description and rang off.  Soooo, I've been purposely keeping my mind off the interview as much as I can all weekend but as the time inches closer, I can feel it in my toes. My skin is tingly, my muscles are tense and my brain's going a million miles an hour. Tomorrow I'll be looking over example interview questions, trying to get a couple of my references to write me something because I'm not sure if I should do that or just provide their names and numbers. All this resume/interview etiquette stuff is doing my head in. I just want the job. The money would be better, the job more interesting and fast-paced, I'd get to work on a team rather than holed up in my little cave on my own working for a company with great people, but ssslllooooww progress and low pay.  I'm going to shutup now :) This is all arse-numbingly dull I'm sure. I return you to Fire's use of the word 'Meme' and Narmer's dating adventures.
