Guess what? they are tested on what they have done which means, the practise compre is exactly the same as the test compre. guess how slack it is. haha, but i cracked by brain and squeezed all my Jap brain juice out into the paper, but still cannot think out a educational guess for that compre. oi, me a foreigner gimme this. bugger you.  Bio paper was umm... eichie? Lol, easy lar. not much. Asked about the process of digestion. haha, managed to remember where pepsin comes in and where the fatty acids go (luckily i put lymph instead of capillary. ahahaha). Some jack girl ask me that q and she jhacked her self. LoL  yea, school over. quite a shock eh? i wrote this blog q early so i wanna sign off here. BB.  ahahaha  Thought of the day: If you wanna apologize (especially to your partner), look into his/her eyes and say sorry.
