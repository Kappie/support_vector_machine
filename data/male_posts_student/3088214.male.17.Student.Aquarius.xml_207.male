I hope everyone is having a relaxing summer but I hope you are still all thinking and learning...there is no evidence of this by looking at our blog...did anyone see Farenheit 9-11...?  My new email address is stephanie.clark@shorelineschools.org.  I would love to hear how you did on the AP test.  Remember it is a difficult test and set up so  only 50% of the students paww with a three or better.  In addition only 8% GET A 5.  Also remember only the top scholars in the nation choose to take these tests...so pat yourself on the back for your effort and the amount you learned despite your score or regroup for a better effort next year.   For those of you who did well  and I am sure some of you did congratulations.  Rob-how is the ASB retreat going?  Enjoy the rest of your summer and I hope to hear from some of you.
