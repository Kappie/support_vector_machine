           
      This site is officially up and running now, I've posted a link to us on the mothership. Pete and I may be the only ones who ever visit - but I hope that isn't the case.   Anyway - welcome to any AZH visitors, and please come back. This blog is in its infancy and we're still trying to see what works, what doesn't and trying to set the tone.
