FUCK. if anybody comes with us, i will love you forever. well, nobody really wants that, so how about i'll just give you money. that works too.   who wants you now, maybe somebody else i'll wait around, maybe you'll forget you were ever here maybe forget you were ever, never here  i'm on the outside looking down, what do i see so much of this cold in the ground, where would i be out on the outside looking down, cover me before you go  it's in your mind, it's in your eyes so it's goodbye again it's way past time for one last try so it's goodbye again
