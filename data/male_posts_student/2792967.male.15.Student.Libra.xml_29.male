     
      Today I pretty much just watched movies and played computer. I saw "The School of Rock", "50  First Dates", and "Bruce Allmighty". Ive seen all of them before exept for "Bruce Allmighty". The rest of my day was spent playing Tribes and some new game Peter has. I gave away a few more Gmail invitations today, Ill probably be getting more, so if you want one, just post a comment or email me. Post again tommorow
