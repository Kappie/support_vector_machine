Turns out her new boyfriend, Jeremy, is a pill popper :( She knew he did hash and smoked before, but he said he'd never do it around her, which I thought was okay, but yesterday he told her that he does cocaine and ecstasy. Gemma's completely anti-drugs, and she says that she's scared to be around him now, because she's afraid of the date-rape drug and stuff like that. She went to see him at 6 o'clock, so hopefully she's dumped him. :( I feel really low now, she thought she'd found a guy she really liked but now it doesn't seem that way.  I spent the rest of the day hanging out with Gemma, and my two other best friends Paul and Charlotte. Didn't get up to much, just chilled.     Jack
