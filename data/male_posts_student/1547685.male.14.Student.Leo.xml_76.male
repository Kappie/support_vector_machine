Ive also seen a total of 5 ppl i know at the fair and one of them was twice. So whats with this? Do ppl not like to go the fair during the summer or are ppl just coming when im not there? Well anyway if you plan to come, dont come on the 10th and only go to a funnel cake place owned by FUNNEL CAKE EXPRESS. Theres another place that sells them for a higher price and even though they have the same name as us, they're company name is Funnel cake West. The rest of this week i have no plans what so ever so if you want to do something with me or you want to hang out then give me a ring. AND make sure you call me if you plan to be at the fair anytime soon so i can see a fimiliar face.    LOOKING AHEAD....for my next post i  hope to have a pic of me and my family during our cruise in Mexico. Its very very interesting so i hope you enjoy it.  Prayers: -Church is looking for a building  -Brother's SATs -Dad's work -My eagle project -My Great Uncle -New SOS council -SOS youth group (new visitors)  P.S If you can pray for any of these things then that would be GREAT
