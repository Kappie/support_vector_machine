(Chorus)  And all of those fries, all of those sumptious fries Extra mayo, extra salt, but I know it's not my fault They didn't say, you shouldn't eat that way So I have someone to blame For the cow that I became  (Chorus)  So you think Big Macs are good for you - Oh no And the ice cream shakes are not so good as well That's right - I'm telling you It's time to call a lawyer - Oh yes Believing who you are: Manipulated victim  (Chorus)  Sue us together... it's the American way.
