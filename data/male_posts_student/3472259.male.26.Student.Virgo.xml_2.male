Remember when he was on the cover of Sports Illustrated for being the only man who could stop Michael Jordan.  It is no wonder that his basketball team, the Detroit Pistons, is formed in his image.  The roster moves he has made have brought this team from being a mediocre team at best, to a contender for the NBA Championship.  Unfortunately I can not forget the "Teal Era" when the Pistons were a collection of undersized power forwards, Grant Hill, and Joe Dumars.  Although they made the playoffs a couple times, this team was never a contender.  The team was not much better even after the addition of Jerry Stackhouse.  After Joe retired things went from bad to worse.  Grant Hill left shortly before Joe was named Director of Basketball Operations.     Thank you Grant Hill!!   Joe was able to work a sign-and-trade with Orlando that brought us two players that were just thrown in;  Big Ben Wallace, and Chucky Atkins.  As it turns out the Pistons got the better deal.  Grant has played only briefly since he left, and Ben is an all star and the foundation of what we now know as Piston basketball.  Over the next few years Joe traded away the high-priced low-talent players to bring in guys with only one year left on their contract, freeing up salary cap space in the process.  Joe was also able to swing trades to bring in Corliss Williamson and John Barry, both of whom, along with Michael Curry and Uncle Cliffy Robinson, were instrumental in the rebirth of the Pistons.  Then, in a surprise move, Joe displayed his willingness to take a chance to make his team better in trading our only "Superstar" player, Jerry Stackhouse, for a young guy named Rip Hamilton.  This was one of Joe's riskier moves, and he was criticized at the time.  Joe also used the teams new cap space to sign free agent journeyman point guard Chauncey Billups.  Joe also drafted a kid out of Kentucky named Tayshaun and an unknown Turkish player, Mehmet Okur.  Most recently Joe made the controversial pick of Darko over Mello.  It might take a few years, but Darko looks like he could be a legitimate center.  The jury is still out on that one.  If Darko lives up to his (I hate this word) Potential, then this too can be seen as a masterful decision.  If not, then he gets lumped with Rodney White and Mateen Cleaves.  Joe has redeemed himself on his draft history.  He has at least been able to trade his mistakes and get something for them.  The   Coup de Grace   was of course the deal that brought the Pistons Rasheed Wallace.  How Joe managed to talk the Hawks and Celtics into this trade astounds me.  It was unfortunate to see Chucky go, but this move also brought the Pistons Mike James Bi%.  Boston decided not to keep Lindsey Hunter, who the Pistons traded away in this deal.  The Pistons quickly re-signed him.  Mike and Lindsey, now known as the Pit Bulls, are one of the best backup backcourts in the league.  All of the moves that Joe has made have panned out.  Ben is two time Defensive Player of the Year AND SHOULD HAVE WON A THIRD THIS YEAR! Corliss has been a monster, mainly in the regular season, but a monster all the same.  Rip has made huge shots in the playoffs this year, Chauncey has given us strength at the point as well as another weapon, and Tayshaun saved the final two games in the Indiana series with blocked shots.  The addition of Rasheed at the end of the year has led to their current playoff run.  In only four years Joe has turned the Pistons into serious title contenders.  Aside from player personnel decisions, Joe has made great choices in head coach.  Joe gave then Pacers assistant coach Rick Carlisle the head coaching job.  Rick then proceeded to win back-to-back Central Division championships with the Pistons, as well as yet another this year with the Pacers.  Joe made another controversial decision before the beginning of this season.  He let Carlisle go to bring in Hall-of-Famer Larry Brown.  Although Larry was not able to capture the Central Division championship, he was able to bring something more special to Detroit, the Eastern Conference Championship.  The Pistons are in the finals now, ready to meat a tough L.A. team.  Will the Pistons be able to pull off the upset?   If Joe Dumars' team wins this NBA championship, he deserves to be the president of the entire stinking world!!!    GO PISTONS
