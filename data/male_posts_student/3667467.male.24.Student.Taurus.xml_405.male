Several times that company has signed my father up for broadband service even though he's never asked, and though we already have a cable internet provider, he still pays the $23 a month for the telephone connection.  According to him, he remains a loyal customer because he is familiar with the service.  I try to tell him that he could get similar functions for free (E-mail, instant messaging), but several hundred dollars a year isn't enough of an incentive.  Of course he complains about spam, pop-ups, and slow connections.  What is two plus two?  Couldn't tell ya.
