So I walk into biology as I always do, and this strange man grabbed me by the throat and threw me around the room... luckily with my secret agent powers I was able to escape his prying gaze.  It turns out it was just Spitz and his grabbing my neck was merely a figment of my imagination.  so as usual, I gave him the thumbs up.  Half way through the class I asked him if he's ever heard the story about the missing turnip... and he said yes...  Questions were running through my head:  was it in a message from god?  Was he the real creator of the turnip trilogy?  Is the turnip a figment of my imagination and he's bluffing?  To test the latest question I asked him to tell me the story, to which he replied, "You go first."  "I know it I just wanna see if you know it I replied,"  I said.  This argument went on in typical kindergarden fashion for years... or was it just a few seconds?  Ya Neva Know.  Sooo... eventually I cracked and told him the story and he told me that General Frye told him years ago(well, actually it was just days)  "GENERAL FRYE'S IN YOUR CLASS!"  I exclaimed.  He said, "no, Tim Frye is in my class."  That was the end of that.  note: exageration may occur in the above tale
