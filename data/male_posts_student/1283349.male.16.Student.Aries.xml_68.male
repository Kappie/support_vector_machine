Got some candles and tin foil and made a makeshift light source for myself (the tin foil reflects it and essentially doubles your light. Huzzah!) So, I read until about midnight both nights, and blew through two books. Oh, and yesterday I worked some odd jobs for Pat, making 20 bucks or so. So it begins, my career as a hungry 16-year-old.  Brian brings up a good topic in his last comment, so I'll put my spin on it.  "In America, If you work hard and persevere, your dreams will come true."  First, let's make a few things crystal clear. Your dreams have to be somewhat reasonable. A poor, muscle-bound Austrian immigrant may be able to realize his dreams of becoming governer, but he's still a long way away from becoming President, especially considering he isn't a natural-born citizen. Alas! So, some dreams are impossible to translate into reality.  Next, you have to work hard, persevere, and have some circumstances on your side. That's the other part of the deal. I doubt Benjamin Franklin would have gone from his printshop apprenticeship to America's ambassador and acclaimed writer and inventor if he was... say... black. He would be just as brilliant, but he probably wouldn't be in the textbooks. That's the sad truth of it. But on the whole, I do agree that through hard work and perseverance, anyone in this day and age can use the system to find limitless (nearly so) success. Just look at that guy on American Idol or one of those damn singing shows. You know, the asian engineering student who sang "She Bangs." He SUCKS. But he persevered and got on national television, and now he's an international superstar of suckdom. Anyways, it's impossible to refute the "work hard and persevere" thing, because it's happened too many times to count. The rags to riches story is true. Why, if I wanted to have a nervous breakdown and end up on drugs, I could probably forsake all fun and dive headfirst into school, being the captain of two varsity teams, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, homecoming king, straight A's, national merit finalist, 1600 SAT, all that, and go to Stanford. At that point, I would of course EXPLODE. I like the way I'm doing things now. A average, I'm well-balanced, I haven't gotten any girl pregnant (yet), and most of all, I'm happy. I'll go to a good college, but not a great one, and I won't be a coke-sniffing CEO when I grow up. I can live with that. I can live with a rather humble existence, actually. My dreams aren't that hard to make come true, thank the Good Dude.  The Dude Abides.
