How can something be filled with nothing? Well, I can answer that question. First I have a question for anyone who is reading this. Have you noticed that I say well a lot? I started out my other journal entry like that. Well, you see, I have a problem with repeating phrases constantly. I tend to turn phrases that aren't usually cliches into just that. For the totally confused or vocabulary challenged a cliche is a phrase used to the point of it being overly familar. If you are still confused, look it up.  Well, (there it is again, it seems to want to sneak into all of my sentences, or at least my paragraph) like I said, I will explain how my day can be full of nothing (and a lot of it for that matter).  I think that that was the shortest paragraph I ever wrote. I woke up this morning at about 8:00 to my mom telling me that we need to get over to Las Positas College so I can enroll in my classes and so that she can get to work on time. Yea, I know, many of you did not know I was even taking any college courses. To tell you the truth, I did not know until very very recently. I am taking a musical theory class and if nobody believes me I have a Las Positas ID card to prove it. Anyways, I kind of mumbled incoherently and fell back asleep. Somewhere in between the time I fell back asleep again and woke up my mom told me that she did not have to go to work today. I personally don't remember it happening, but it did. So we leave the house at about a quarter until 9, we get there at about 9 and we go to the class that my mom says that I am supposed to register at. The person in there told us that we are in the wrong place and that we need to go somewhere else. We walked over there and stood in line for a little while. Now, I believe I told you this before, my life is pretty dull. If you want to skip the details be my guest, it probably won't be very much more interesting than this, but thats just what I think.   After I got done registering I had to take my school ID photo. Interestingly enough just before she was about to take the picture I was yawning and not even facing anywhere near the camera. Luckily the lady noticed and asked me if I was ready. After replying yes and letting my face turn back to it's normal color she took the picture. Now (I think this is becoming a catch phrase similar to "Well"), I am not a very photogenic person. If any of you ask to see my ID I will probably be a bit reluctant. I think that my smile looks really fake, which it was mind you. Although if you have ever seen a picture of my brother, Derek, you will see that my smile is absolutely ravishing in comparison.   We got done there and after taking a brief tour of where I am supposed to be, we headed in the general direction of home. Actually, we did not end up there. I needed to get a book at the library since my week is not going to be filled with a lot of action. We went over to Civic Center library (it is kind of in the center of Livermore for anyone who does not live in this state and happens to be reading this) and remember that it did not open until 10. It was about 15 til 10 so we went over to city hall (which is adjacent to the library) and decided to bug Derek's girlfriend, Amy. We got done there than walked back over to the library and went in. Needless to say, the book I needed was not there (actually, that was probably needful to say, but you would figure after all that trouble something ironic is bound to happen). Thankfully, the book was at Springtown library as most of you (and now all of you) know it is near my house. To make a long story short (and gramtically incorrect), we find book, we go home.  I got home, played a little golf (Mario Golf that is, pretty good game. On the Colin scale of 1-10 I would have to give it an overall 8). Then I sat in my bed and read for about three-four hours straight. Now, Colin has already read this book, but he is almost done with it (yea, I know, I reffered to myself in the third person, everyone refers to me like that, why can't Col...I mean I?).   That, my friends, was a whole lot of nothing. Have a great night everyone. Drive safely...er...if you are driving that is...and if you are, drive extra carefully...cause you probably should not be online whilst driving.    *EDIT*  As you may or may not have noticed, I kind of (Well, not kind of, more like did.) changed the page around a little to look more like my own. I am a fan of the black background, white text.
