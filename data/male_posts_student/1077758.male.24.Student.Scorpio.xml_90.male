It should be interesting, we're going to go see a movie when Billy gets off from work, and I'm meeting Johnboy a little early to just hang out and shoot the crap for a while.    While on the phone with John, we talked a little bit about how we'd just end up raising several levels of hell while going around town.  We talked about going to K-Mart and hitting the little customer service button things and running off. "Customer assitance in feminine accessories. Customer assistance in feminine accessories."  Then I told him something I'd done in the past about running around with some tampons and looking as confused as possible in the process.   "Yeah, I was wondering, do you guys have low carb tampons? The missus sure could use some of those if you know what I'm saying."  We both laughed.  We probably shouldn't have, but we did.
