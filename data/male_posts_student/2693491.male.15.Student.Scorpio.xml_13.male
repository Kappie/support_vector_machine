SHIT! home is being sung by the retards now... whiny little shits. hope someone at the parade tells them to shut the fuck up. opps, they actually ENJOY listening to whiny meaningless songs.       went skating again this morning. got the joy of having an overweight fat fat fuck to come and tell us to go away. it must have been hard work for him to get out of bed, dress, then haul his fat ass down. being the good citizens that we are, we kindly walked away. then some retarded bald nigger shouted something like "use your fucking brains lah basket!" or something to that extent from the safety of his flat and quickly hid himself. the pussy didn't even have the guts to come down and say it in our face. stupid shit.
