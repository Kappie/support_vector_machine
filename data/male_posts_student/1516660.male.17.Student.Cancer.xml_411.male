In the morning was nothing much la. Chem Prac was meowing and the anions are maddening! Yes! Okay...today isn't much fun. Except Physics Practical. HaHa. Me, Kelvin, JiaHao and CQ talked and talked. I found out that Yu Yi, this girl JH likes, is in choir. I..er-hmm...helped JH send a poem to her. O.O!! :P  Righto. Today choir, we had the parade rehearsals again! Weee! This time, Mr Sars is very happy with us. O.O!! O.O!! What a surprise! I guess we are all happy bout that. Hmm...we went back to practise.   Guess what? We have to assemble at 6.30 tomorrow! Sigh. I got my father to drive Boon Chai, Gloria and CQ to school. HaHa! That solved the transport issue. Even ducks would meow everywhere! We practised till 9. Can you believe it? 9? Yeah...it was so darn late. I reached home at 10, bathed and quickly ate dinner. Even cats have no time nor energy to come online yesterday. Thus, explained the lack of a blog entry.  Ayioh...Boon Chai and CQ told ghost stories in the train you know! Me and Gloria were scared to death! Even Gloria and I talked about  A LOT  of things on the way home. h why yes! A lot! While walking home myself, I even had to call WQ to keep my company. HaHaHa!    Today   O.O! Oh my my my my! Today, it was a very early time to go to school. Why yes! I even had to call CQ and Gloria up. That CQ ar! Very funny leh. He actually went to the station at 5! O.O!   Right. We [icked Gloria, CQ and Boon Chai up at Admiralty Station without much mishap. 'Cept that BC was late for a bit, however, we ended up being early in school. Weee!   Okie dokie. After lotsa practises, we finally performed. The parade performance was meowingly okay. I mean, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. Yeah...we went up to the hall. Now, that's when the fun started.   Of course, choir is the finale (best of the last ma :P). The front parts were pretty boring. Especially the quiz time. MOST especially the quiz time. I fell asleep then. HaHaHa!   Okay. It was choir's turn to entertain the crowd. John told us yeterday that for years, community singing is mainly "the whole shcool looks at the choir singing" kinda thing. This year, we are so gonna change that. Yep.   Indeed, we injected spice into their lives. We went up there with our silly moves and roused the crowds. I was grinning all the way. Heck if I sang wrongly! I was so enjoying myself! When I went up there, I saw that S22 was sitting near the front. When they spotted me, CQ and JS, their eyes went like O.O! HaHa! They also danced along to Home. I was like beaming like mad. So happy that my class was so supportive and outgoing! HaHaHa!   After the concert, we were so happy. The teachers were telling us that we did a gret job and all. We stayed back for photos taking and more song singings! HaHa! Choir is so cool! Weee! Three cheers and three cheers and three cheers for choir! Hip hip hooray! Hip hip hooray! Hip hip hooray! WEEE!!!  After that fun morning session, staying back late countless of times this week is so totally worthed it! After the celebration, we went to foodcourt to eat. Me, Janet, WQ and CQ eventually went to the foodcourt to eat. HaHa. We met JiaHao they all there. JH was jealous that I got to hold Yu Yi's hand. She was besides me ma. HaHa. I even held her back lor. :P I bet that JH would never accomplished what I did. HaHaHa! Not that I am interested in Yu Yi, but I can tease him with it. Muhahaha! I am sooo evil.  After that, we went home lor. Actually, me and CQ did. Janet and WQ went to bowling. Now, I am going to library to meet CQ, Gloria and WQ to do homework. I think I am only doing my Maths and Chem. HaHaHa. Meow moo!   So...see ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!  Stand..up...for...Sing--ga--pore!!! Do....the...best....you....can.....!!!!
