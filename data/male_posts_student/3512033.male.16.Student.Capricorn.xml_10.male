(well, the wierd ones anyway)... 1337.   well, my plan was to gain a copy of adobe photoshop, and fiddle around with the program in attempt to improve my site's "image". well, this seemed like a pretty simple idea... seeing as i knew a number of people who owned this program, and i figured i may even get some tips on how it all worked, to save me some trouble...   well, that was about when the trouble started...  i began by asking my mate raven, who said "sure, no problems"... but he had lent it to someone else,and would have to get it back off them.   To make a long story short, they couldnt find it, and i am left with an indefinate period of time before i may lay my hands on this sought after software.  but then, i remembered...   i remembered that my dad, who is an architect by trade, had a copy of photoshop at work... so i made a quick phonecall to ask if he could bring it home for me. he said "sure"  so now i have a copy of this much needed software... however, most of you that know me may know that none of my stories end that simply... and this is no exception...   yeh, you guessed it, the cd is a dud...  well, not entirely, i mean, it seems to have all the programs and installation files and everything... its just that it doesnt install... :S    anyway... it seems like my loyal followers may have to wait a while before my new layout is started, let alone completed... but, im sure that the literary content of my blog will be enough to keep you enthralled....  :S  anyhoo, i think ive past the word limit... so ill shutup...
