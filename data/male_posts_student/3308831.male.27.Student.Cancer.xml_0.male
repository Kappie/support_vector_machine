The scary thing about this is that I'm not even sure I want the job. It's not the coolest company in the world and to top it off, I get to work in VB6 :D The job also requires me to drive around Sweden a lot (one or two hotel nights a week). We'll see. I'm probably going to another job interview in Lund next week. If I screw this one up, I can rest assured I get to try again next week :D
