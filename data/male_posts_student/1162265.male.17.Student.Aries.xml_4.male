My moderately peaceful Socialism, or *gasp* things I notice about Black Suburban life.(Oh big scary word phrase!).  Or even my problems with religion (I'm still a Protestant though).  So, today, I have to watch the state of the Union adress for Mr. Cotters class.  That is gonna be serious Ick, at least I don't have practice so, I'll actually do some work.  I'm gonna take some survey now out of boredom and post to results so I appear special because I'm posting about stuff.  Okay, maybe not, I'm to lazy to.  Yoga, I need to take that when swim season is over!  There is a place in town that should teach it, but I'm not sure.... Arggg... Can't swim season freakin' end!!!
