I'm scared to hell that I'm not good enough, that sometimes I can make a spark when I bang the rocks together, but mostly it's inefficient use of my time, and I should take up finance or some shit.  But I need to give it a go, because I am close.  Two years in this program was invaluable...I know the craft, I can teach the craft, I've met a treasure trove of folks...  But landing a gig, getting a script optioned...not the cakewalk.  A lot of people say that the easy part is getting the agent, and after that the world of Hollywood swallows you whole and you beg that it spits out what's left so you can put that back together and have a semblance of happy life.    So I want to make films.  I'm excited as hell about making films.  But I really need to write films rather than do anything else.  I fuckered a good shot with Austin Meyers on making a film, but it turned from a fun job into a Hollywood venture that depressed me and led me to not answer his last 20 phone calls.  Nothing against Austin, who I really like as a person, but I wasn't excited about making the fourth installment of the film I had written.  He needed to get another writer on board.    And I don't want this blog to become a lamentation of the writer's life...that's just dull.  But there's not a whole lot else going on right now...I am career focused at this, the last semester of my time at UT.  Does it have to be that way?  Maybe.  I'd love for more to go on, but looking at it, my friends here are in the same boat, and my friends everywhere else are fully work-forced, for the most part...and they're not around me on a daily basis.  Which leaves me to look for all sorts of shit to take up my time...I'm getting a ton of writing done, but I'm playing the drums about an hour a day, and I'm buying a new tennis racket tomorrow...get some cardio going without driving to Gregory to wait for a stairmaster (though I miss weights and hot tubs).    So, in 2004, I've gotten two phone numbers.  These weren't numbers I asked for...they were just given to me.  I was out, doing whatever in both situations, when conversation with girls I found attractive started, and meandered, and after a while they had to leave, but this line was the same both times --    Hey, I've got to go, but I've really enjoyed talking to you.  Here's my number.  Call me and we'll continue this conversation.     Okay, I'm not in my best athletic shape today, but regardless, those numbers  were given to me without recourse .  I hadn't asked.  They were under no obligation.  They offered the information.  Sounds money to me.  Except  both times , I've called and gotten no answer, and left a message (nothing too long...I'm wordy but I'm not going to fuck around on an answering machine), and never got the call back.  And I'm honestly flummoxed.  I can't see how pedestrian phone messages would kill someone's want to call me back after  freely giving me a number .    When I first moved to Austin, I never took numbers, I only gave out mine.  If something was going to throw down, I was going to let them make the move...I'm good at calling back.  This worked in Shreveport rather well, but I pulled out a quick 0-3 in Austin, one of which really bothered me because it was a girl that I had an instant connection with and we spent a day together dicking around at Substitute Training, where she actually  held my hand  after lunch, finger lock and everything, and said she didn't think sub training would be any fun.    Gilbert Gottfried, I'm with you --  What The Fuck?   I quietly recovered with a few dates with a chick named Kat who moved to San Diego of all places, and it was fun but more because I was out than because of who I was out with.    So I'm bitching.  Wooooo!  Damn right.  Because I live in a city with 800,000 people, and I can't seem to get out of this dating funk.  This semester, there is no "the one girl" in my classes, because I've got ONE CLASS, and Debbie is taken.  Students?  I've gone down a similar road before...didn't end well.    In high school, my friends and I used to go to Wal-Mart and play  Get the most phone numbers .  The real race was always between myself and Daniel Harr, the self-proclaimed  ladies man  of this Rogers High School clique.  I can remember one time in particular, when there was so nothing to do in Rogers that night, and this was going to be our sweet redemption for life, and Daniel took an early lead, and all I could spot were people who I had no interest in grabbing numbers from, but if I was going to keep up in the game...  But then Andrea Green wandered to the photo lab to see Courtney Johnson (is that a real person?  I think so), and I pulled up, talked it out, and grabbed both numbers.  At the time, it was the most base reception of numbers...I was friends with both, this wasn't a booty call, just a way to win a game (later I'd find out that Andrea had a thing for me that I never went for, and maybe regretted just a little).  And Daniel had received four numbers, but the voters chose quality over quantity, and I was declared the big winner.  There was no thrusting onto shoulders and parading through electronics and sporting...just the acknowledgement and belittlement of Daniel Harr by the others in the group.  And I couldn't help but feel cheap...his numbers might not've stacked up, but he did the dirty work.  I played pussy foot.
