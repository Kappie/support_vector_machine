Ive been down here ever since! ive only been upstairs for food and soda, thats it. Ive called people but nobody can do anything until around 8,9,or 10. AHHHHH!!!! im going crazy!!! theres nothing on television either so im going back and fourth from the couch to the computer, ive already posted 3 times today. yeah, im pathetic, but you know what, your pathetic for reading this hahaha just kidding......or am i? well to keep up with my routine im going back to the couch. hopefully the time flys by so i can meet up with everyone. until then i will continue to watch television. parting is such sweet sorrow
