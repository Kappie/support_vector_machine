Luke did some stupid stuff that could have gotten us in alot of trouble, but hell, who cares? We all ran around and yelled and crazy stuff, like Rich and myself's pants went a little low. Becca's finger was licked by me, and Rich nearly blew up. It was hillarious. Then when me, PeeWee, Luke, and Alex H. all were throwing pool balls across a table, one flew and hit me square in the place-of-immense-pain-and-pleasure. It was all great though and we all had fun, even though Aaron wasn't invited!
