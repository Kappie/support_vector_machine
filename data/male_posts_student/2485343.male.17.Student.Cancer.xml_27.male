Anyway, after school I went to Thornton and I saw  her  I was to afraid to talk to  her .  I don't think she saw me, im such a loser. I really cant put my finger on it, but there is something that gets me about her. Where when I think of anything, she is apart of it. I was looking at the ceilings the other day and it reminded me about her. Ceilings as Floors. I remember that from that Saturday. And whenever I smell something, it reminds me of her. Like her watermelon lipgloss. I cant get her out of my head. Its unbearable, the worst part about it is I cant talk to her. I want to really badly but peers say not to. 'if she wants to talk to you, she will come to you.' but what if she wants ME to talk to HER??? Does anyone think of another scenarios other then the obvious? But I guess I sit here and wait. By the way, ivy been waiting for a month now. Just thought you'd want to know. It reminds me of a song by HotRod Circuit, 'At Natures's Mercy.' It goes a little something like this:  Hard not to get hooked  Hooked on you  Hard not to get hooked  Hooked on you   Think of all the trouble that we get into  Whenever I'm around you  Nothing that I can do  All the secrets and mistakes, yeah, that were made  What else do I have to say?  I hate being without you   Never gonna leave your side  Cause I can't resist the crazy things you do  It's gonna take a lot of your time  And I hope someday I can give it back to you   Hard not to get hooked  Hooked on you  Hard not to get hooked  Hooked on you   Think of all the trouble that we get into  Whenever I'm around you  Nothing I can do  All the secrets and mistakes that were made  What do I have to say?  I hate being without you  I love that song. go pick it up. anyway, i'm out. i'll write something tonight, if not, tomorrow.
