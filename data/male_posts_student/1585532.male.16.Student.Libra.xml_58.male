Your destination unknown, but this much is clear, a reservation has been made in your name for an extended stay."  "Wave goodbye to the real world."   "You have just entered the Twilight Zone. What happened here to dim the lights of Hollywood's brightest showplace is about to unfold once again."   "One stormy night long ago, five people stepped through the door of an elevator and into a nightmare. That door is opening once again, but this time, it's opening for you......"   Yup, I rode Tower of Terror.  And it freakin rocked.  I'll tell all you viewer(s) more about it when I have the time.  But yah...FREAKIN' OWNED!  Okay...an assload of tests tomorrow so....bye.
