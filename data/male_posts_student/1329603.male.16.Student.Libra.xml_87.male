I was at a funeral yesterday; a girl at STRS was killed in a car accident and the choir were asked to sing at her funeral. At a church called St. Mary's. Sally was there, and she cried. I hope she's in school tomorrow. I don't want my lingering image of her over the holidays to be of her crying. Not good.  Just been to the choir party... not a lot to comment on, other than the inclusion of a Tom Lehrer CD which was played continuously. Gloria patri et philio.  I'm going to Aroma demain... w00toid. C'est bon.  Uh, I really need to get a more interesting life, don't I?
