Critics might pointout a lack of dialouge, acting or common sense, but what gripped me was the fantastically stereotypical depiction of the Vietnamese as hookers.  But then I realized the actors weren't Vietnamese, they were mostly Chinese, and wore outfits that resembled something out of Imperialist British-Era occupation.  But, watching shit blow up is cool, cause seriously can you beat a scene entitled "Explosions" on the DVD?  Can't say they didn't warn you.
