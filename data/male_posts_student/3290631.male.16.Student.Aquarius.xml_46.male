About my life at home, my childhood, my brothers...and Dan knows very well that a lot of this stuff has shaped the person I am.  I don't understand it really.  The only thing I can come up with is that I avoid talking about myself but on the same token, I find relationships with people that much more rewarding when all my cards are on the table.  It's an odd thing.  I asked Emily last night if she agreed with the fact that I know a lot more than she does about me and as I suspected she strongly agreed.  So we spent the rest of the conversation talking about me.  It's a weird thing to feel like someone you're relatively close with doesn't know much about you....
