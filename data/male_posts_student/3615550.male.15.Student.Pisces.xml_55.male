After the publishing page is finished loading, that little bar above the task bar says "Error on page."  I guess that means that it didn't load the little buttons.    This is bad, because my laptop has a slower connection and I don't have as much internet time on it (parental controls, you know).  I've got to figure out a way to fix this.  Do you think Blogger Support could help me?  I could try them...  Man, this is definitely putting a cramp in my blogging style.  I'll try to be back to normal as soon as possible.  In the meantime, everyone vote in my poll, and then go visit David Session's Blog.  Maybe that will keep you occupied until I get things back to normal.
