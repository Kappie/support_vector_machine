Then i had to drag my pedals and my guitar back home...god...so tired... suppose it was much worse this morning as it was raining quite a bit and i had to walk to the bus stop.  So after all this i'm here at the computer with a nice ice cold beer and babylon by david gray on the radio. i think i'm going to see my aunt on friday so i might have to call jonny to see if we can reschedule that business meeting over a coffee. i ought to call him but chances are he'l call me first (as always). i'm off. maybe i'll drop back here later...*sigh* i also ought to call alexi tomorrow and see how his meeting with his ex went. everyone seems to say she's an extreme bitch and i only spoke to her over the phone while i was a bit "off the ball" so i wouldn;t really know. according to him raphi wants a piece of her as well. just like raphi to get in the way...ha...poor alexi...hope it goes well. allow.
