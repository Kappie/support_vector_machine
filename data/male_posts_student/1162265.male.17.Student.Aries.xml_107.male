Atheist think they've found the truth with their weird mind games, when really it's just a mindset settling for less.  Science can always explain how things happen, that's not the problem but atheist seem to think "how" is the only thing that's important.  The "Why" of a situation is of equal important, unfortunately that's always harder to explain.  Atheism seems to graze over it, that's the problem.  Christianity ask why, Judaism ask why, Islam ask why, Hinduism ask why, Buddhism ask why.... I mean, they may have problems along the way, but they still try to ask why.    Whatever.  I think something talked to me yesterday.  I was lying down, trying to tune the outside world out, and focus inward.  That's not the easiest thing, because the slightest noise would drag my attention away.  But finally I managed to zone out, into pretty abstract thoughts, then suddenly either it was a thought or a voice seemed to speak clearly into my ears.  It said something like "Now how do we divide your brain" I wrote it in my theories journal, but I had already forgotten it, when I broke off the meditating.  It was a seriously strange experience, not because it hasn't happened before, because it has happened in the past.  It was strange, because I was doing something abstract hoping to only get mundane results, and got something crazy.  But then again, yo estoy muy tonto.... Pero sabes esta!
