Dude it was amazing though it was sort of a let down, i mean you hold some place up to "magical" standards (so to speak) and when they dont meet them its a let down. You can pretty much do the city in 4 hours(shops places to eat etc). But the second night we were there we went to see "The Producers"(written by Mel Brooks) it was so frikin hilarious. I mean you couldnt stop laughing. That was my first time seeing a Broadway performance. I was also corrected in my thinking of Broadway, i thought that it was just one theatre called Broadway but its actually just all the plays that are in theatres in the street Broadway(well that clears up a lot of my misconceptions like how they have 5 plays going on in the same theatre within the same week lol) New York is a great place to go, unfortuneately you have to be 21 to go out at night and just kind of have fun by downing an irish drink and hustling the local pool table (hehe). The city lights up at night and it almost looks like the wizard of oz (crap comparison i know) well anywho now tonight i have blocking for Tartuffe and i was planning to go to the lake house with some friends so thats been delayed, ill only be able to go wednesday night through thursday night now. Well thats 2 nights to have fun and my best friend is driving up from charleston to come with me(well be the only 2 guys lol but most of our friends arent really the type u stare at in a bathing suit) so its just going to be a blast. well i gotta go do some stuff. If there is one thing i learned from going to New York, it's this : Some places are better left unvisited, or else you ruin the mysticism that made them so wonderful in your mind.
