Well I hate to tell ya Grace but its 10:15 at night, everyone is tired and we already played with you, so shut up. Even though I'm going up to play with you after I write this, you are making me go nuts. Alright back to my day, after I had lunch I kinda just sat around and hung out all day. I went outside because it was nice out for a little. And then me and my family went to Ruby Tuesdays for dinner. Our waiter was really cool, I don't know why, he just seemed really cool, that's all I really noticed about that whole thing. I got a bacon cheese burger which was really good. My dad got a steak, my mom got this chicken thing and my brother has to always be difficult so he had to get shrimp. But when we were there, it was very crowded, and then it started to rain outside. But right went we went to the car, it stoped, so it was nice. And then I came home and really did nothing. I have kinda just been either sitting inside or going outside. I talked to my cousin, Michael, on the phone for about a half an hour, and then I talked to KLT for about an hour, and then Amanda and Natelie and Whitney for about a half an hour. And now I'm just bored. I'm thinking about starting my term paper, but I don't know. I'm not in the mood to do homework, but I have that and a project do, really soon. Its going to really suck to do, because I'm going to keep putting them both off I know it. But this is all I have left to do in this class, so it's not that bad. Only 9 more days of summer school. We have Monday off thankfully because CAT takes it off, so we follow because almost everyone's parents work there. My dad does, and I'm sure if you're reading this your mom or dad does also. It's that crazy. I hate this area, it's so perdicatable. The west coast looks very good. I'm trying to decide want I want to do for the rest of my life too. I'm still kinda on the lawyer thing. But there is something else that looks very appleasing, but a little harder to get into. But very simple, and I like that. So we'll just have to see. A lot of deep thoughts are coming out of me tonight. Oh! And this happend awhile ago, but I finally got something from Mcdonalds for calling them. I got a gift certifcate for a free large sandwhich. It's not much, but hey! It's saving me 3 bucks! Which I don't even have, I have one dollar in my wallet and that is the exent of my money. I'm broke and need a job horribly. But I'm not going to get one till next summer, so I'm going to be broke for a long time. And I'm getting my license in January, how I'm going to pay for the $2.00 gas, who knows. It's going to be crazy though, and I'm going to be stretching it really far. They put tennis on over Jay Leno, they are delaying Jay Leno for a half hour of tennis? It's just a recap to, I hate when they do this, they do it the whole time of the Olympics. Wow, I have nothing to do at all. I need to start that stupid term paper or the project, but that's not gonna happen. Well my dog finally stoped barking, after about 20 minutes of me writing this, she has finally stoped. Thank gosh. Well I'm going to stop this before I just keep rambling on. See-ya.
