I read practically all of Eastman  Lairds Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comics by Mirage Studios. My love for the turtles has been reborn. I was amazed at how much of their story I had relearned. Getting to re-know Casey Jones, Leatherhead, Triceratrons, Utroms *shout out to krang* and all that other nonsense. Man... Felt Great.   A bunch of missing links were solved as well. From the super nintendo game "TMNT Tournament Fighters", the final boss was Karai. I had no idea who that was until I re-read the comics. I found out that Karai is actually a girl (before I thought she was a very metrosexual man) and she is somewhat of a villain character. She takes over as a Shredder figure later in the series. Also I had found out the origins of The Rat King. Man... Felt Great.   Well back to my day. It was all cold maxin, We had arrived at the facility and I cought a couple hours of sleep before the party started. It seems that my nextdoor neighbors were having a party too. A Classmate of mine, Casey, lived next door, so Iassumed it was his birthday. I didn't say much cause we arent really that aquainted and all that jibba jabba. I didn't eat much like I said I would. But later in the evening I took the dive. I slipped into the darkness. And indulged... Junk Food. Even though I didnt want it, I enjoyed it. Man... Felt Great.   So it was 11p.m. now, My cousin arrived to get some grub, then we bounced. We watched Rush Hour, and some parts of Soldier. But yeah, Im pretty tired. Today was a good day. Man... Felt Great.
