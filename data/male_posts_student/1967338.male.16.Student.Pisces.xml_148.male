And you were taking over the blog.  Well, this kinda sucks. Im back to not having any contact whatsoever with Michael, and he hates me for it. I hope he doesn't turn me into another Chris Linday, or I wont even be able to read What Kind of Day has it Been.   Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!
