I love the compassion for the murderous thugs. "Three Times as many Palestinians Have been killed by the IDF than Israelis by Palestinian suicide bombers. Where's your outrage over that? Or does Israel get a pass for being 'God's chosen people.'"  "Calm and Restraint?    Somehow I have a hard time seeing calm and restraint resulting from the death of poor Mr. Yassin."  And this - this is the most amazing.  This is why we need to ditch israel today.    "Whether its fair or not we are now fighting what is a spreading world war. Its going to be a long and very very difficult war given the best case scenarios.  Helping fan the flames of hatred in the muslim world against us is idiotic.  And maybe the israelis are 'right' but ultimately it doesn't matter, what matters is there is a 1.2 billion muslims and they view them as 'wrong'.  If we were infinetely strong we could pick and choose who was morally right or wrong. And in honesty if we find serbia 'wrong', we must find israel 'wrong'.  But we aren't infinetely powerful anyway so we have to ultimately do what we can, where we can."  So forget standing up for right and wrong...if the Muslims have the numbers, we should just abandon civilization and hope they don't hate us.  Appease them and pray that they leave us along.  Spineless Democrats!
