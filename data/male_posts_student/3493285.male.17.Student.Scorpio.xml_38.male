OH ms saacks is realy great. i wish i could have every teacher at hilhi. i miss coach keck. this post is lame so far.   hmm, so we did this thing in TOK where we had to talk about different things that awaken our senses to different memories. i think it's really weird how that happens. you smell one thing and BAM you're back last summer. my example: this kid just walked by and whatever he's wearing (deodarant, detergant, cologne..good hygeine perhaps?) really smelled a lot like the houses that we worked in at the street of dreams this past summer. and then all of a sudden i had all these good memories flash right in front of me. our brain is quite a unique thing..it can recall so much for all the different senses. it's so freaking weIRD.   in less than 10 days i'm going to be a senior. it's a freaky thought. i really cannot believe that i've been at hilhi for 3 years. it feels like it's been..well not 3 years. also..man i'm going to miss the seniors that are leaving SO FREAKING MUCH. i dont know what i'm going to do without a lot of them..a few of them have become my very closest and best friends. and i feel like they are literally just being ripped away from me. you know, i used to think that time erased things. but i think more than anything people erase things. people erase horrible events from the past from their minds, they erase dreams for reality, they erase other people. i dont know..i just hope that i can keep in touch and stay close with the ones that are leaving that really mean a lot to me. because at this very point in my life..they mean more than they know. werd. WERRRD WERRRD!!   hmm the bell is going to ring soon. so i'll probably update again later tonight.  I HAVE THE DASHBOARD CONFESSIONAL CONCERT I AM SO FREAKING EXCITED! CHRIS CARRABBA IS HERE! YESSSS! tonight is going to be one of the best nights of my LIFE!  i love you all. :)
