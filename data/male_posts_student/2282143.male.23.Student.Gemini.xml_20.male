Christmas was nuts, as Sam and I tried the dual family Christmas thingy.  Yikes.  I thought it was ok, but she didnt.  It was a bit rough for both of us, as this is probably the last time I would see my cousin Leigh for a while as she is now taking the job from the Big M.  That and Karli was in (another cousin) and whatnot.  It was hard to leave my family too.  Anyways, I have a new toy, as is evident from the new link on the side.  Canon SD100 digital elph.  3.2 MP with a 3x optical zoom.  Sweet tits.  Well, back to life as usual... Kinda.  Busy week this week being New Years and all.  That and I have Erin's wedding this weekend.  Fun times.  Speaking of New Years, anyone have any plans?  I need some...   Next week:  The Adventures of Mike at the Old Folks Home!
