Only Stacey accidently whacked Big Poppa Pump with a chair. Either way, the angle is set.  Look for them to be competeing with the Dudley's soon.   Lita  Trish vs Gail Kim  Molly:   Well, I was correct on which team would win.  Look for Lita to shake off her ring-rust and take the title by Survivor Series. The women's title is like an ex-girlfriend of mine...everyone gets a turn...   Spike, Devon, and Bubba vs. La Resistance and Rob Conway in a Tables Match :  Somehow, this ended up turning into a title match and the Dudley's ran away with the Belts.  Okay, so my pick came a day early.  What the hell.    J.R  King vs. Al Snow  Coach:  Man did I call that one wrong.  Not to worry though.  Give it a few weeks, and our regular announce team will be back.  The problem is, during this time, I will be looking forward to Smackdown! for Micheal Cole's insightful views on wrestling.  Scary, aint it?    Christian vs. RVD vs. Y2J for the I-C Title:  Called this one, didn't I.  Next Monday, RVD takes on Christian for the I-C title in a ladder match!  RVD may or may not win the Intercontinental Title next week.  What we can count on is a big time feud between the two going into Survivor Series.  Smarks underestimate Christian, but he's really done well as the I-C Champion.  Christian is no Macho Man or Mr. Perfect, but he's making the I-C title important again.  Time was, when I was young (forgive me for geezing out, here)  the Intercontinental title belonged to the second-best wrestler in the WWF.  When Ricky Steamboat won the belt at Wrestlemania III , that really elevated that title.  Christian and RVD have the potential to have a series of great matches, ala Savage and Steamboat.  Let's see what happens.   Kane vs. Shane-O-Mac (Last Man Standing Match) : I called it, but the next time Shane wrestles, can he top that?  Shane is no Mick Foley, but he pulls off the Mick Foley moves on a rare occasion.  Let Shane disappear far a while..and let Kane get a title shot against Golddust...I mean Goldberg.   Randy Orton vs. Shawn Micheals:  Everything I read has indicated that wasn't the match that it could have been.  Anyway, Orton won, just like I called.   Goldberg vs. HHH  When I made my picks, I forgot about the stipulation where if HHH got disqualified he'd still lose the title.  Not that it mattered.  I'm still stunned that Trips would job cleanly to Goldberg.    I still say that Kane gets a run with the belt before HHH comes back. Look for a short reign by Goldberg before he bolts to Japan.  This is just purely my opinion, and that's all.   LinktoComments(' ')    urlLink  ">If You got something to say, Give me a Hell Yeah!!
