It is a great movie, and I recommend it to anyone that wants to see a good crime/humorous movie.  otherwise besides this, it has just been a normal day.  I had to go see my doctor, it seems like I may be getting a little better, but its a slow and long process, but any progress is good progress.  Maybe I'll final get what I want. I've been avidly  trying to make contact with her, but to no avail, I don't know maybe I just need to wait, maybe its fate I'm not sure, but id like to find out soon,   Against the grain Against the odds I'll rise and I won't trip again The dawn of a new day never looked As good as this
