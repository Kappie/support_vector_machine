For those who don't know,  DeGrassi Junior High   and   Degrassi High  were television shows in the 80's about life as a teenager in a very cool, urban, and Canadian high school. That's right. Canada. Chock full of "aboats" and "soary's" and "where have you bean?"s. Anyways, one of the characters in that show got pregnant, and decided to keep the baby.  The GENIUSES at Canadian Television decided that it would be good to make a Next Generation show now that the baby of that character is junior high age. So for the past three years, we've had a whole new generation of kids at DeGrassi. And what a generation. Makes me want to be 14 again. But Canadian.  I can go on and on about Emma (the original cast member's baby)  and her new boyfriend, who is the blackest person in Canada, or Ellie and Sean the "alternative kids" or Ashley and Craig, musicians, rivals and star-crossed lovers with great hair and lots of attitude. Or Manny, who is looking for love in all the wrong places, mostly with other people's boyfriends, and JT, the class clown who could be so right for Manny now that she has aborted her and Craig's baby (although in the conservative USA, that NEVER happened).  But I shall gush about Marco. The cutest episode ever aired last night, where Dylan, high school hockey star (now remember, this is Canada, so this guy is like the undisputed king...er...queen of the jocks) asks Marco out. That 17 year old has got mad game!! It was so smooth and sexy, I almost cried, because I know NO ONE that smooth and sexy. The best part was that Marco's formerly homophobic friend TOTALLY helps out. Then they go on their date, and exchange "I think you're pretty great"s over fries and burgers. Then there's a movie portion, where Marco tries to touch Dylan's hand, but he's too nervous to grab it, but Dylan says it's OK, and grabs Marco's hand....oh my goodness. This show is usually filled with great stuff, but this is the only episode that made me crunch up into a ball of omigodthatissofuckingcute-ness. Watch it on  urlLink the N , Friday nights at 8/7c. This is my first NPM advertisement, but, eh, these things happen.
