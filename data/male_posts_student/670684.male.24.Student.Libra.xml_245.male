We talked about his writing, what he needed to get into a grad school, what grad schools would be good for what he wanted to do, and how not to want everything (writing, producing, acting, directing, editing, color correction) when you've never done anything.  My main focus to him was that he neede to write on a regular basis.  I don't subscribe to 1000 words a day (a Jack London favorite) or to wake up at 6 and rewrite everything previous before you start on the new (Hemingway)...I don't even fancy myself with James Joyce, who could only come up with two words a day and still be festive.    This blog is my writing exercise.  And I'm glad you read it.  And if you didn't read it, I probably wouldn't write it, so I'd lose the exercise, get frustrated on scripts about the repercussions of college-aged women starring in internet amateur porn, tell the script to fuck itself, and watch PBS with Brian Thomas.  Therefore, thank you for reading.  I hope you enjoy it.  But do understand...while you are my audience, I don't necessairly write for you.    Katie keeps the largest volume of personal journals I know of...since the seventh grade she has put her thoughts down into a dainty hardcover book, shelving them at completion and returning to them in fits of trouble, happiness, or nostalgia.  She let me read a little from a few of them, and I was never really interested in reading what she didn't want me to read...partly it wasn't my business, partly I was growing into a more understanding, less insecure boyfriend, and partly because the writing kind of sucked.  She was great with quotes...lots of people save quotes for usage later, but few do it as well as Katie...she was also good with identifying music.  But when it came to recounting the trial of the day,  I lost any interest.  She could talk about tongue kissing her boyfriend du jour, and I'd just keep going, because I couldn't get into it.  Seceretly, I hoped that sex would help her writing immensely.    It wasn't her as a writer that was the problem, though...she was writing for herself.  The journal was never meant for me.  At the time, that sounded preposterous... Why would you write something just for yourself?  Memeroy is for you, language is for others .  I never even considered writing something if no one else was going to read it...it was a waste.  A fair amount of my writing is personal reconcilliation, but either 1) in a way that marks a good (or at least adequate) story, or 2) in a way that I can provide a trial run on a topic, with the idea to edit and lengthen it later.    I was afraid to turn the blog into the more personal narrative format...most I've read are awful, and I don't want to waste anyone's time with needless banter about my daily activities.  But I needed the practice, and an audience was enough impetus to keep going.  So I created  urlLink Touchstones , a site for literary discourse.  I posted, but no one else got involved.  So  this  was born, and became the political outlet.  Not a problem, except there are a lot better of sites out there for political awareness and leftist discourse.    The guy I met with didn't sound so keen on the blog thing... But if I'm writing, shouldn't I be working on a script?     Little Rock with two med students who go to bed early.  Of course, so do I.  I'm getting acclimated to Central Time just so I can go back to Eastern come Monday when I hit Florida.  The drive was long...700 miles alone yesterday.  Terrible radio stations.  I've never enjoyed the return near as much as the approach.  I used to try to work the greatest maneuvers to stay at Disneyland when it was time to leave, telling my parents that I left a pair of my sister's underwear in one of the dresser drawers, or that I lost a dollar near Fantasyland, or that I missed it and wanted to go back.     urlLink Call It Sleep  was incredible.
