HW has always been far more advanced in almost every aspect of this job. The wackiest of wacky ideas and storylines have always been sparking off in HW.  Terminator, Matrix, Back to da future, Spiderman  et al are the quintessence of wild fantasy and fiction. The way they are picturized sets them apart from our BW. The picturization sends shivers down da spine since they seem so realistic. I guess, problem wit BW is dat da movie makers are never inclined towards experimentation. They target at ensconcing themselves rather than giving the sane audience somethin to cheer 'bout. They insert all kinda elements in da movie from steamy scenes, item numbers to cheap comedy aiming people of every age group and land up making a " khichdi " of a movie. Ironically, they are the winners since they are pretty aware of da fact that our country doesn't lack people, who actually love all da vulgarity and such stuff! On the other side, movies wit descent and realistic storyline are often seen fizzlin out and going pear shaped. Lakshya is an exemplar of this phenomena. This fact has encouraged the rise of such movies and has ensnared the industry. They have become inexorable and have tied chains around da BW. Theyâ€™ve stymied BW from seekin for imaginative ideas and have stopped its growth.
