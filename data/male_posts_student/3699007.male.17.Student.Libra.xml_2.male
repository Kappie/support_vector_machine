Anyway, I've recently started listening to a lot of Buddy Guy.  For those of you who don't know anything about music made before 1990, Buddy Guy is a bluesman, and the man who Eric Clapton says is the best guitarist alive.  Jimi Hendrix was often seen sitting on the edge of the stage at Buddy Guy shows taking notes.  So yes, I jacked a CD from my dad called "Buddy Guy and Junior Wells Play the Blues" and was very impressed.  In fact, it is now probably my favorite CD.  Junior Wells is one of the best harmonica players I've ever heard, as well.  I bought Hoodoo Man Blues by Junior Wells the other night and I liked it pretty well too.  But, Buddy Guy's music (and much moreso than most blues artists) blends blues, rock, and funk.  And Buddy has the best voice of any bluesman I've ever heard.  John Lee Hooker is the only one that comes close.  The man can SING, and contrary to popular belief, his voice is definitely not gone.  Just got his show from 3-6-03 and his voice is strong as ever.  So, I'd say Buddy reminds me of Jimi Hendrix at age 70, but with a ton of energy.  So yes, I'm definitely gonna catch Buddy the next time he comes through Atlanta, especially since he is one of my dad's favorites and I know he'll pay since he's never seen him.  Getting off the music subject, I called Britt today...he's in Myrtle Beach until after July 4th and had forgotten to tell me he was going, so I guess that rules out the possibility of me having very much fun until after July 4th.  Talked to Alex...he said he went to Australia, but I don't know how much of that to believe, hahaha, but it is nice to know he's alive.  And I texted Carbo last night and he was stuck in Dallas waiting on a plane, guess he got home today since he had an away message up earlier.  I'm sick of everybody being on vacation and I'm not, dammit all.  I haven't been anywhere since the summer of 2002 when I went to Jamaica.  Maybe if my dad wasn't so addicted to his job, he could go do something.  Oh well, that's all I have to say right now.  Oh yeah, and pray for my grandmother please...she is pretty depressed right now because of some stuff that is going on with my uncle.  Some of you know what happened, but if you don't, then I don't intend to tell you.  Anyway, keep her in your thoughts please.  Thanks.  Ok, I'm gonna go find something to do to pass the time until late tonight when me and Amie have another crazyass conversation. :-)
