Huey Lewis and the News - If this is it  I woke up surprisingly late today. 10ish... i thouhgt i was gonna be up by 7 or so to go mow the lawn., but i woke up and my parents weren't home, and when they did (they were at Publix) we didnt have blueberry pancakes like i was hoping. There was a big chunk of day where i dont remember what i did, but i do remember watching the MArlins game and mowing the lawn, resulting in a 15 dollar pay check. 20 dollars comes my way tommorow when i get paid for catsitting.  Another pointless day, which will be followed by two more pointless days before school FINALLY starts! I can not wait personally, and i know a lot of my friends cant eitehr... except Katie Sadow... cuz she is WEIRD. Is he kidding? Yes. Well, i dont have ANYTHING left to talk about... I think I want to have the halloween party this year... if my parents say yes... SORRY RYAN, im sure your parents will be disapointed to hear you cant host the second one...  Take a picture Filter   Awake on my airplane Awake on my airplane My skin is bare My skin is theirs Awake on my airplane Awake on my airplane My skin is bare My skin is theirs I feel like a newborn And I feel like a newborn Awake on my airplane Awake on my airplane I feel so real  Chorus: Could you take my picture? Cuz I wont remember Could you take my picture? Cuz I won't remember Could you take my picture? Cuz I won't remember Could you take my picture? Cuz I won't remember Yeah  I don't believe in I dont believe in In your sanctity You privacy I dont believe in I dont believe in Sanctity A hypocrisy Could everyone agree that No one should be left alone Could everyoone agree that They should not be left alone yeah And I feel like a newborn And I feel like a newborn Kicking and screaming  Chorus  Hey dad what do you think about your son now Ah hey dad what do you think about your son now  Chorus (x4)  I love that song a lot. I listened to is like 5 times today in an attempt to fill this endless void in my life called BORING. Good night everyone.
