I have a creepy little avatar and everything. It's that girl from the ring. mind you, i haven't seen the ring. i'm told i should. maybe i will, just so long as i can borrow it from someone. it also has some latin on it. its from the inferno. unfortunately for you, you can't read it, because the entire image is only 100 x 100 pixels small. consequently, with 7 lines of typing, theres no human way to rread it. bahahaha. i know what it says. well, see, its now 3:03 am. staying up this late, it probably isn't a good idea. however, time keeps passing me byyyyyyyyy. so here's my creepy story of the evening. so i have laptop here beside me (since no one (else) is here beside me, you see) so i can listen to good music. and then, after 3 hours of running off battery, predictably enough, it died. so i went to fetch its power cord. i unplugged the ac adapter and, get this, the little light STAYED on. I was like wtf, mate, you HAVE NOOOOOOO POWWWWEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRR. DIE DIE DIE. but the little light stayed on. for a minute or so. then it turned off. thats how i know i didnt hallucinate. see, the little buttons on the light board look like they turn on when you press buttons but THEY DON'T. freaking weird little things. crazy madness. no power= no lights. then why? WHY?????? someone please answer my questions. explain the world to me.   anywho, playing with images. i am in search of ubercool things.   livejournal has this goat. it really creeps me out. really really. i don't get it.   there emily... IS THIS ENOUGH? WILL YOU ACCEPT THIS AS MY ENTRY?????   i had a really shitty day today, but i have already given that detailed account to my livejournal. you probably cannot read it. you don't have my username. ask me personally. i'll give it to you once i'm sure i didn't write anything really bad about you in there.   p.s. i think tweedy died
