INNOCENT PEOPLE !  its not fair!  it just makes me sick.  but i dunno if i could control myself i was one of those cops.  i promise it  would  cross my mind that i could kill this person... man.. just ticks me off.  blah.  anyways.  i bought the "Beyond The Sea" song from the end of Finding Nemo.  i love that song!  its awesome!  i wanna sing it as a solo at our next choir concert.  hopefully the Rimes will let me.  well i think its time for some Zzzzz's.  night.
