Was thinking about it and I do admire William Hung. You know, the "She bangs" boy from American Idol 3. He wasn't the best and the laughed at him but he was so pure. He stated his desire- which was to make music his career despite the fact that he was doing civil engineering in the Uni there; and was willing to at the very minimum, try for it. At the very end, after his "gig" in which his bootie was going a fair bit of gigging itself, he simply said, "I've tried my best and I have no regrets at all". I want to be like Mr. William Hung, except, with the ability. I'm cowardly. Life on the whole is daunting.   Desiree has a good vocabulary. I should get a book of Desiree words to use for G.P.   Slowly getting the hang of simple fill-in's. You know, now that I think of it, about not thinking that much. Have been asked to sing for a gig in PJC. Bunch of smart maats- how could I resist.   Dilemmas. I need work on my spelling. It hasn't been too good of late.  Have to do Chem now. It's late. Need a miracle.
