Tobin and his wife... excuse me, girlfriend,  were a bit odd and quite glued, although they seemed almost breaking apart at the end. Je ne sais pas.  Really knackered, and to be honest I was appaled to read in Patrick's blog that himself and Sam are going out. What?  Anyway... tired to Hades, I'll repost later. Ciao.  Love, Jon Roskilly
