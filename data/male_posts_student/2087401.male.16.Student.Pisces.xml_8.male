So when he got out to the swimming pool, I punched him way harder than I would actually be capable of punching him, then jumped on him and held him underwater until he died.  I had no remorse, no regret, just a sense of relief that he was gone.  In the dream, it actually felt good.  Of course when I woke I was shocked and profoundly disturbed.  It wasn't even scary in the dream, but it's scary to think what it might mean about my unresolved feelings for Laura.
