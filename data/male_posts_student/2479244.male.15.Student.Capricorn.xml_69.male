Days when I want to stand and hang limp and fulfill a life of nothingness.  I have these days.  Sometimes I want to make one clean hole in the back of my head, and then I realize that its not worth it. There are things to live for. A few of them, but seldom as they are, they are entirely worth living for.  I have these days.  And I always will.
