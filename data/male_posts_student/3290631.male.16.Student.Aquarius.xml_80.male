At the end of the interview, she asked me if I could start tomorrow.  I was so ecstatic.  I am working from 10 am to 3 pm from Monday through Thursday.  And on Friday I work from 10 am to 1 pm, but there are going to be instances where I stay later.  I'm basically going to be running errands, carrying things around, maybe some painting.  Then around the third week, I'm going to start on more office oriented work, directly under Ms. Gaines.  My pay will be $8 an hour, which is huge for me.  Last summer I worked for minimum wage.  I owe a huge thanks to Emily for hooking me up with her mom.  This is gonna be so awesome.
