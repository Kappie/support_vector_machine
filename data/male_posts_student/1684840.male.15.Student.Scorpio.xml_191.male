Not long after, we quickly packed up what hadn't been put away last night and made our way quickly to the port for our ferry to Dover. We arrived within 30 minutes of the departure time and hopped onto the boat at nearly the last minute, then rushed up to the top deck. By the time we had arrived across the channel my camera was loaded with around 200 pictures of the journey and lots of the great white cliffs of Dover which were gleaming on the shores of the UK.   A quick 2 hours up the motorway and we entered the outskirts of London - nearly there! After travelling about 20 minutes, the residential area began to get more dense and lots of commercial and inustrial zone began to appear. We passed a few congestion zones and we kept spotting the eye on the horizon between the high buildings which I would have expected to be in somewhere like America. We finally saw Westminster, Big Ben, the London Eye and the Thames when we crossed a bridge. It wasn't a long look, more like a glimpse, but we were well on our way to Bloomsbury where our hotel was.   After a while checking in and dowloading photographs from the camera from on our way here, we set off into the wild and busy streets of London. Grandad bought the Congestion Charge from this car park shop and we went to the bus stop to catch the bus to Trafalgar Square (there were buses everywhere!) People were everywhere! The fountains were spreaying jets of water all over the place and Nelson's Column stood tall in the sunlight surrounded by four lions (and hundreds of foreign tourists of all ethnic origins). It wasn't long before we made our way to this archway where we could see Buckingham Palace (a sight to see another day), then we continued into SW1 where all of the government buildings were and eventually we came to Downing Street, the MoD building and the Cabinet Office etc.   Heavy security outside Downing Street prevented us getting excellent pictures but we got quite a few anyway. Big Ben stood gleaming gold over the buildings so we made our way up to it and the end of the street, just in time for the Six PM chimes. It isn't really that loud as you hear it on the TV or the radio. The busy traffic and noise of the people everywhere drowns it out. The dense buildings around the city reminded me instantly of our visit to San Antonio last summer and was delighted by how the landmarks stood nicely in the centre of it all. It almost seemed unreal because this isn't how I imagined London to be at all. I thought there would be lots of space but it is so up close and personal!   We made our way across the bridge and towards the London Eye which we boarded after about half an hour due to a couple of small queues for tickets and boarding the world's largest observation wheel. The whole 'flight' was truly brilliant. As soon was we were at the wheel's full height, the whole of London was visible in its true form - city EVERYWHERE! Buckingham palace and all of the government buildings were visible and tons of skyscrapers and cool looking buildings were too, not to mention Westminster and the Houses of Parliament. The whole experience was amazing and we got 'ride photos' when we came off too (the whole ride was operated and managed by Tussauds!)   We came back after by bus (I got on with a child's ticket hehe) and had room service for tea. We rang Mum and Dad and now I'm sitting here writing this entry. We have to get up early for breakfast tomorrow or else we don't get any! So I best be off... I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE HERE!!
