I wish I could be closer, so I can see my little cousins growing up, and to be a bigger part of their lives.  It also really makes me want to be at the poing where I'm married and settled down and have a kid or two that when they bump their head, they look to me to see if it's "supposed to hurt" or not, and if they realize it's supposed to, then they come running to me with arms open wide for comfort.  Someone just running up to me and saying, "daddy".  Yeah.  That would be nice.
