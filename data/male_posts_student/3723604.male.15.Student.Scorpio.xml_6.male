Anyways, if you need to contact me, my g-mail (I love saying that) is rebelzeppelin[AT]gmail[DOT]com.  If you want to get in on the "action" of having a G-mail beta account, go to www.gmailswap.com  There you will find people willing to invite people into G-mail for a small price: the price being ANYTHING you could think of.   What did I offer for my g-mail spot? The MEGABOT pic from yesterday ;P   -REb
