But any one can percieve time like that. how would it affect how they interacted with people who percieved time linearly?        I thought of time being percieved as longer or shorter in diferent circumstances.  Like in a car.  If you spend more than four hours in a moving vehicle, whenever you were got into the vehicle in the first place feels like yesterday.  And what about days that feel like other days? like when thursday feels like monday, and sunday feels like wednesday.and you know how time flies when your having fun?  It doesnt always do that, but it almost always slows down when your bored. SQEE!
