And I got the limited edition with an extra song, You Give Love a Bad Name; a cover song for Bon Jovi, produced by Beu Burcheall, guitarist of Saosin. Now all the cd's in my 3 cd changer have something produced by him; this one, the Saosin - Translating the Name EP, and The Bled - Pass the Flask album. It also came with the video for Right Side of the Bed, and a very nice black paper packaging with gold writing and their upside down star logo. There were also only 30,000 ever published. I personally like the cd  a lot. It really shows off the talents of each member. The guitar riffs and solos are so much better, and Alex's screaming has improved so much from Suicide Notes. The only dissappointment to me was that the lyrics didn't get any better, but they're really good, since Suicide Notes had really good lyrics anyways.     I can't wait to get the new TBS tomorrow. There was some worker chick in Hot Topic today talking about how she really liked it, and thought it was awsome even though John left and she loved him. She said it was different but good. I heard about half of it, and from what I've heard I 'd have to agree with her and felt the same way. You just have to get used to the new sound. I hope I could go to the live acoustic set too.     I'll try to get Underoath while I'm at it, I really want that one still.    And now about my weekend. I went on some "hiking expedition" with some cousins in PV last night. We went to this one park on top, and hopped this fence that led to stairs that went down to where a storm drain ended. Then we just kept going down, but decided to stop since it seemed like to end up nowhere and the only light we had was from the moon and the fog started coming in. We might come up there some other time and try to go down as much as we can to see what's down there.
