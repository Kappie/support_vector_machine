Who here watches The OC?  They say that how you spend New Year's Eve is how you'll spend the rest of the year, so everyone on the show was rushing to kiss their significant other during the countdown.  I guess I'll spend the rest of the year hanging out with my father, aunt, and three-year-old cousin in a hotel-condo in Vermont.  Whadayagannado.  I had two very informal resolutions.  One, finish the first half of the history project that has been hanging over my head.  Two, get a date, with the main one in mind.  I'll let y'all know how they go, the second in sort-of vague terms.  Ask me online if you want some more explanation.  The France trip is just one month away.  Tomorrow my dad's getting me a camcorder so I can document the experience.  I'll show y'all the DVD when it's done; I've already finished pre-production.  Apparently there are a lot of French-Canadians in Vermont.  I heard a couple talking near the skiing.  And we got Quebecois TV in the hotel-condo.  I understood not that much of it.  But then I was watching one of the Africa episodes of ER tonight, and I understood every word of the French they spoke in the People's Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Whatever.  They all speak English.  Speaking of ER, I just got my late Christmukkah present, ER Season One.  It's pretty good so far; I've watched the first three episodes.  This was back when they had all white people but one (not that I care about that sort of thing, but as Frank says, "It's getting to look like the goddamn UN General Assembly in here).  It's not as good as the current ER, though.  The new ER is much better, with cool scenery and action and arms being cut off by helicopter blades and epidemics and such.  Noah Wyle only has nine more episodes.  Now I'm rambling.  There isn't that much more to say.  I'll see you all on Monday.  So much for vacation.  Oh yeah, and Richie's in Australia now.  G'day!
