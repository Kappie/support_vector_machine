Funny thing about my schedule is that the floor that my class is on alternates every hour.  So first hour is on the first floor, second is on the second floor, third on the first etcetera.  I hope we'll be able to use the computers the first day.  I know last year we didn't do anything because everyone has to get info from the IMC and get passwords etcetera, so I don't know.  I'm taking my camera tomorrow to get some pictures.  I hope to get some good shots :-)  I'll probably post them all on my website.  Yay!  I dunno why I'm so excited.  I really don't have anything else to say.  It's 11, so I should be getting to bed!
