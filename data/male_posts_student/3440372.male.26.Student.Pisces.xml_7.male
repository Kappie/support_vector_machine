That's what I'm supposed to be doing, but instead I am posting on here. I have also read lots of other web logs instead of working. It isn't as if I don't like the work but I just can't seem to get motivated. I'm convinced it's because my deadline isn't for another three weeks, in fact I'm sure that's what it is. Yes, I know how important it is but I would much rather nose about in the   BBC   web site.  I am sure I'll get it done, it's just that I thought I would have more enthusiasm for the work.  But my life is so difficult (oh be quiet twat boy)  :: hangs head in self-indulgent shame ::
