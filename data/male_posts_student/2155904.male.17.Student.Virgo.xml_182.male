Got up and the family was once again gone without notice so Tyke had the house to himself for a while.  He played some ESPN and called HoChyt about playing bball with him and Kramm but it turned out he wasn't able to play so they set another preliminary date for next week.  Tyke really wanted to play bball though so he called up Macaroon and Piggy J and Amed and others and they got a game going up at Amed's house.  It was great for Tyke cuz whatever team he was on won.  Thanks to Tyke's outright domination of the court.  He was unstoppable for much of the games.  It was really a lot of fun.  Even the outside shots fell pretty well.  And nobody could stop Tyke from driving the lane.  Man, this was one of the better days Tyke has had in a while.  He still wasn't able to actually dunk but he can get pretty high.  Like from a straight vertical leap he gets pretty close to the rim with the ball.  But that isn't important.  After the domination without Tyke's shirt on, the gang of Tyke, Piggy J, Amed, and Macaroon all went to McDonald's/7-11 for some food.  It was a nice little end to basketball.  Then they all went home and Tyke made himself smell a little bit better after all his sweatiness.  Then he ate some ice cream and some really really good freshly baked cookies before Macaroon called him up.  Macaroon, DCups, Piggy J, Amed, and Dr. Phil all came over.  They played some cards and then some poker with $5 buy-ins.  Tyke ended up losing 5 but he didn't play all that well.  He even had pocket rockets once but he really didn't play them well and lost on the river.  So he deserved to lose some money overall.  But it was still cool.  Tyke is starting to realize that he plays better when he plays against a bunch of people he respects.  Like playing with the people that are (sorry to say it but it's true) not as skilled or experienced makes Tyke play worse.  He gets greedy and makes bad calls and bets and ends up losing money.  But it's all for fun anyway so it isn't that big of a deal.  He did get beat today so it wasn't like the other people didn't play pretty well too.  Yeah, so Tyke hasn't really said much for today considering he did do quite a bunch of things.  He talked with Dotti a few times and he is going to help her out tomorrow so that should at least be some fun hanging out with her.  And he also has to visit his ailing grandfather who has come upon some rough times now.  Tyke really doesn't have anything to say about his feelings or anything right now.  He hasn't really thought about anything for a while now which is probably a good thing.  Hopefully it will stay like this for a while.  Time for bed.  Boring blog.
