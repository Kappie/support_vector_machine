It's something that I've been noticing as well, we're not really seeing a campaign  for  Kerry, what we're seeing is a campaign  against  Bush. And really, it's a pretty sad commentary on the state of politics. If the DNC feels that their chosen candidate (Kerry) isn't strong enough to beat Bush on his own merrits, what does that say about Kerry? And they're saying just that by putting fort a campaign that focuses on beating Bush. You could say that de-facto a vote against Bush is a vote for Kerry - but that's a pretty far cry from, "Vote Kerry, he's the man we want in there." Instead we have, "Vote against Bush, because anything is better than what we have now."   UPDATE:  I just ran across an online advertising that said "Help make Bush a one-termer" - it was sponsored by the Kerry for President campaign. I followed the link and it was official, but I can't display it because it was a randomly generated ad (which I discovered after I refreshed the page).
