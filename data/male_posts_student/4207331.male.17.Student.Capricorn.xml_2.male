Since I have a narrow mouth bottle, I was able to put water in it and place it on its side in the microwave.  This only allows me to put in at most, about 8 ounces of water in the 32 ounce container.  I ended up putting 6 ounces of water in.  This will probably produce little to no change.  There will be very little (comparatively) heat gained by heating up the water.  I am noticing a definite loss of pressure in the bottle, as I am now able to squeeze the lexan bottle and have it compress.   Hmm, I hope the water will boil faster.  I should like to try this experiment with more water.  I will let you know how it ends up, once the bottle cools down.  -Ben Salinas
