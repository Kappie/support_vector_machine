They're waiting for the light to change. Then you get these people that come late to the cross-walk, see you standing there dutifully waiting for the light to change, and then they hit the button again. Sometimes they click the button a number of times.   What's the deal with that? Will clicking the button more times make the light turn faster? If so, I've never heard it. And what do those people think when they see somebody standing on the curb? Don't they think they've already hit the button? Most annoying thing ever.(Actually it's not as annoying as trying to sleep with drunken guyswalkingdown the street yelling that Italian soccer anthem. Now THAT'S annoying.)    Jimmy Carter's Closet    As most people in North America know, the DemocraticNational Conference is underway. Critics are hailing the speech of Bill Clinton, while Gore makes out with his wife onstage and Jimmy Carter wonders where his Nobel Prize is. Here's a bit of his speech:   "When that trust is violated, the bonds that hold our republic together begin to weaken. After 9/11, America stood proud, wounded but determined and united. A cowardly attack on innocent civilians brought us an unprecedented level of cooperation and understanding around the world. But in just 34 months, we have watched with deep concern as all this goodwill has been squandered by a virtually unbroken series of mistakes and miscalculations. Unilateral acts and demands have isolated the United States from the very nations we need to join us in combating terrorism."   urlLink Tony Pierce  said of him:    "First of all, jimmy carter's old, and he's been building houses for the poor while you're buying complete seasons of friends on dvd through amazon. He'll be 81 years old come rocktober. Carter was in the navy for eight years.   "I served under two presidents," Carter says. "Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower, men who represented different political parties, both of whom who faced their active military responsibilities - with honor."   What Jimmy Carter tonight reminds us is that every once in a while it might be a good idea to have a president who not only was a real military veteran, but one who could also win a nobel peace prize, and earn it."
