It started ok with the usual "let me show you the ropes" beginning. After about 15 minutes i started to get uncomfortable not knowing what the plot was, but my patience hadnt run out yet. After a bunch of random junk and mini mini plots things started to get hairy. Firstly, they were using the same tricks and jokes many many times, as if we "little kids" (its a PG movie ) would forget about them and laugh again. For example, Garfield had already made the point that his chair was his chair, and no one sat on it. Well, when Odie comes and sits on it, Garfield states that again, just to remind us, which wasnt bad. The he pushes Odie off the chair and he starts watching his music video. Well, after about 6 times of puching and jumping and listening and dancing i started to get really pissed off. OK, we get the picture!!! Odie is a dumb bitch and Garfield hates him. Garfield on top of that has the stupidest "jokes" i have ever heard and not only that, he repeats them about a billion times. And one other thing that just really got the worst of me. I was on the verge of going crazy when all of a sudden, Garfiled starts singing!! What was he singing? I dont know. First of all, Bill Murray cant sing. Secondly, i did not pay 8 dollars to watch a fat orange fur ball sing about how this lame dog has taken over his owner....dude, cmon. So, i just couldnt handle it.
 
Now the question is...why did i go see it in the first place? well, i was on a time budget, and that was the only short movie that started at the right time...but from now on, i guess ill just play games instead. And a warning to all....Dont go see Garfield or you will die!!!
