You are taken aback by the booming, neon-light filled metropolis. Ah, it is amazing. You decide to find a comic shop and pick up some DVD's of your favorite anime 'FLCL' because they're so freaking expensive in the US. So you go over to a helpful looking Japanese man dressed as a roll of sushi to advertise for a new restaurant, and ask him where you can find 'FLCL' (pronounced 'furikuri'). He changes from his happy self from just a moment before and looks in utter horror at you. He stutters, "F....F...F....FURIKURI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" You think, 'what the hell?' Then the cry is repeated by another behind you, then another further down the street. Eventually the cry is heard all over the city as the people on the streets rush for cover in the buildings. Even the people on the cars pull their cars over to the side of the road and run for cover as well. You are left alone on the street, utterly stunned. A piece of paper blows by in the wind. There is a dead silence. Then slowly, in the distance you hear a small motor sound. And it gets closer. And closer. In the distance you see a small yellow speck on the horizon, followed by a river of dust. The dot gets bigger and bigger. THen you realize you need to run. Fast. Your feet will hardly move, but you get them to run anyway. you look back over your shoulder to see what is behind you, and you are shocked to your core: it's a yellow vespa being rode by a pink haired alien wielding an electric guitar like a broadsword coming right at you screaming at the top of her lungs. You think, 'this is it, I'm gonna die! I only wish I could have gotten those DVD's!'  BANG!!!WHACK!!DONG!!!!*crash**roll**blackout*  Moral of the story: never ask about FLCL in Japan. It hurts. A lot.
