I've debated it with myself at length, and I finally convinced myself: if I don't post unless I feel inspired, I'll never feel inspired and I'll never post. Sometimes you have to just start writing and hope for the best. If I don't make it a habit, I'll never do it. So anyway, there arose a funny (immature) situation today. Josh, AJ, Krispin and I were chilling in Josh's computer room. Josh was at the computer, engrossed, while Krispin stood and fidgeted with his ... jeans. AJ looked at Krispin in horror, then looked at me as though appealing to me for normalcy. I had my finger in my nose at the time. Needless to say, he didn't find the support he was expecting. It was a pretty ridiculous collection of happenings and I thought I'd share it with the world (i.e. the few people who read this garbage). I wonder, do other people write on their blogs with the mentality that they're writing  for  someone? As though they're writing for someone else's benefit? I never do. I go in with the assumption that anything I write will probably not be of any consequence to anyone else but me. But I write anyway, because it helps me think about things. Most of the time I'm merely typing as I think and what surfaces, does. That's the end of the story. I'm certainly not here to impress anyone, so what does it matter if I write pointless crap 99% of the time? And besides, if I didn't write trash on so many occasions it would give you a wrong impression of what I'm really like. If I didn't post something unless it was brilliant, people would read the successive brilliant posts and think, "Wow, he's brilliant." And I'm not. Just look at this post. It's obvious. Okay, I don't think I'm in any danger of being mistaken for brilliant on the best of days. And right now, I'm dog-tired and hardly know what I'm typing. I could delete things that are stupid or unnecessary or stupid, but it's far more interesting to leave them. I find that whenever I write late at night, two things happen: one, I never have much of a point and two, I put commas, in really weird places. That one was on purpose, though. I swear. I'm sick of this. I'm leaving.
