Not only that but the homo's in band began to play 'Taps' (the popular military song to honor dead peoples that gave their services). Our coach went nuts and was about ready to go ape on someone. I didn't care too much. I was standing on the sidelines just minding my own business when coach said JV offense was gonna go in. I was quite happy. But not only did I go in...but my friend Travis went in on Defense. Travis is short and a little husky...but not fat...if thats possible. Me and a few other guys on the sidelines got a 'RUUUUU-DY...RUUUUU-DY' chant going. I had a great time. Although we lost...
