Do I try to start over? or do I try to correct a mistake?  I don't know what to do...  I really loved some things about Ottawa, and hated others. I just am confused as to what I am going to do next year. The most certain thing is that I am willing to try again- and this time try 100 times harder, not to let myself fall into the same mistakes that plagued me before.  we will see what fate has planned, all I know is the stresses and problems with last year gave me grey hairs... I am not going to let that happened again in a million.
