Also, Requiem for a Dream was his doing, as well. Amazing.  The show in Cochrane was pretty spectacular. At first I was concerned about the amount of bubble gum there, but the mosh pit was one of the best I've seen. Ever. However, sweaty twelve year old boys must realize that the point of a mosh pit isn't to actually try and hurt one another. Ah. To be young again. I feel I'm getting too old for that sort of thing, as I would only be able to jump and flail around for about sixty seconds before having to stop and catch my breath.  I also bought a CD at HMV the other day. Pretty Girls Make Graves. Not my usually preferred type of music, but I am in love with the CD.  Work. 10-5:15 today.   breakfast first.
