It could be because I have not seen anybody (my friends that is) in like the past three days! And you all know that I do not do well without any social interaction. I'm dying here people. Then I get phone calls from people hanging out at like midnight, and I should be there! Instead I'm here hanging out with my grandparents. Its cool though, I always said a break would be good for me. I am going to call Emily tomorrow, cause we are going to San Francisco together in like three weeks and we need to book a flight! I'm so excited...that will be so much fun! I'm kind of pissed at my parents right now because they keep making me do all of this crap! I'm just tired of it...I need a break. I should go to like ....I dunno...Florida for like a month and take a break from everybody! I need it! Well...I don't know what else to say...today I woke up late, ate everything, and did nothing...Until my parents decided that I should have to do stuff. My mom was out gambling away God knows what at the casino with my grandparents all day. I've been scheduling a hotel for when we go to Canada...sounds like a trip from hell. My mom informed me today that the entire trip's purpose is to find drugs that they do not sell here and then to buy them in mass amounts. I'm all for drugs (LEGAL ONES PEOPLES!) but serious...trips should have at least one fun aspect...nope...none in this trip! It's gonna blow already...I know it! So yeah...I get to go cell phone shopping in COUNTDOWN: 3 months! I get a new phone on Sept. 25...I'm so excited to dump by ghetto phone! I don't know what else to say peoples...I've managed to write a lot about a day that consisted of nothing. Well, I'm off to go blow up lots of explosive material! I love fireworks! Did I ever tell you that I am a pyro!? I love it! Here's a little somethin' I found in someone's profile. Till Later y'all!  It was twilight On the Fourth of July Sparkling colors were Strewn across the sky And we sat close enough That we just barely touched While roman candles Went soaring above us and baby Then you put your hand in mine And we ran from the rain Tentatively kissed goodnight And went our separate ways And I've never truly felt the way that I Felt the Fourth of July  Yay for 4th of July! I love America! Good Night all!
