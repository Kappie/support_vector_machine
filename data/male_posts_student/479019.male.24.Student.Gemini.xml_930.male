I decided that I didn't wanna keep flip flopping from getting up at 5 AM, and then getting up at like 10 AM, and then back to 5 AM due to irregular work schedules... so I decided to just keep getting up at 5 AM and hitting the gym if I'm not working in the morning.  It's 8 AM and I've already worked out for an hour, showered, made scrambled eggs, made 2 café lattes, checked /wrote email, read the news online, and now I'm blogging. I like being productive! I'll probably get to work early again to find parking and do some reading.   urlLink Laine ... I still don't get what's so funny about carrying milk to the car!  I'm only 1/3 through this  urlLink Krishna Sen  book on Indonesia cinema. So far it has some stuff on Chinese ownership of movie production and distribution, and a small section on how Indian and American films were competing in Indonesia for market share in the 1950s. This is really interesting for me, given what I'm hoping to do for future research. The book, however, seems to be mostly about nationalism and building (kind of whatever for me).  ***
