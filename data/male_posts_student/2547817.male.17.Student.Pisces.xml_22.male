I mean, there's no doubt I have my talents, but these guys are something special. Everyone is from like ACJC, RJC, HCJC, NJC. Damn.  It was something like survivor. Undoubtedly, the thought of putting on a face had crossed everyone's mind. Some did. Definitely. I know I tried my best to  be me.  I'm just worried about the things people say. Even if they don't realise it. My heart is heavy. Burdened. Yolked. I don't like it.  I don't like getting my hopes all up and all then falling all the way to the bottom. It would be a real drag. I need to pray for serenity.  My mind is crowded. STOP YELLING! SHUT UP! PLEASE... SHUT UP! shut up. I've forgotten what I wanted to say.  Econs is a wolf in sheep's clothing. A science disguised as an art with words poorly stuck onto the surface with paper glue. I see through it. Disgusting. Limitations are inhibitions. Liars, Thieves.  Help. I'm going nucking futs.
