Anyway, throughout the whole process, I listed to "In My Heart" by Moby a total of 80 times according to windows media player.  And all tonight...and early morning...I've probably listened to the same amount of music from the Garden State website, I just went there, and cool music started playing, and I didn't stop it...;)  Anyway, I listened to "Take Me Out" by Franz Ferdinand and was instantly hooked, it's an incredible song, I might have to buy the CD, it's only 8.99 at BestBuy!
