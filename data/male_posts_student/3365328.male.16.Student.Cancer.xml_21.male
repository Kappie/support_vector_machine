Instead of burning my retinas by looking directly at the sun, and turning into some kind of blind cripple, I used a telescope to shine an image of the sun on to a metal plate. Now that's science!  In other news, various other tests have been waving their stapled pages at me, namely Science, French Listening and Geography. Hopefully I've done well enough in each to score me some fine-looking grades. If not, never mind. Life goes on.
