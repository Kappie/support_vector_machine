Big shout out to me...i have been making time to write for like an hour every day(except yesterday, and come to think of it, no time for today either...damn) anyways....writing more....liking what is happening with my story.....found some lost notebooks from mcae......so, am in a revise-a-go-go mood, and am really wanting to read some poems and perhaps polish a few stories and submit 'em....it is on my list.
