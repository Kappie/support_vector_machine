Joe and i are talking infront of the other two there. supposedly joe's moved in with kovac and they're having a party that night. everyone's invited...joe's a good guy but i was nervous about him being there when someone else was there too. anyways this is like what my 3 post..awesome this stuff is sorta cool Sam
