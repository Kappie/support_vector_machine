So, I really must say, I feel sorry for most white guys when they are in High school.  Nothing stands out about most of them by default, so they have to either accept that or go out and act real strange.  I guess it's the opposite way for me, I can't pinpoint exactly what I am, unless I believed in Pan-Africanism or something....  Then I had school.  It was pretty boring as usual.  Cotters class was interesting enough though, since we went over the state of the union, even though it is annoying when some people have a completely useless hatred of Bush, like a pure out blind hatred, that seems to have no actual grounding!  I walked home, talked with Doug, but most amazing of all is that I talked with two people I rarely ever talk to, and need to talk to more.  The first one, I'd rather not mention since that's a rather personal one, I'd rather not disclose.  The second being Kim, good to know we are heading back towards bluer skies, because I was seriously an ass to her for the better part of last year, and I really regret that.  Damn, I seriously need a haircut.
