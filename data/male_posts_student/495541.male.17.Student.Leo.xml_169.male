I won't be at school Wednesday, Thursday or Friday then Monday either.  Boo yeah.  Right.  I'm going to my sister's wedding in Ohio.  It's going to be tight, I think.  I'm taking my camera of course.  I'll take pictures, yo.  So tomorrow will most likely be boring.  It will be the last school day of the week.  Wednesday we leave for Ohio and it will take us most of the day to get there.  It's going to be fun, I think.  Hopefully I'll have fun staying at the hotel and stuff.  I'm going to take a lot of pictures, for sure! :-)  I'm thinking I might go to be early tonight.  I didn't sleep much last night and that sucked.  So night.
