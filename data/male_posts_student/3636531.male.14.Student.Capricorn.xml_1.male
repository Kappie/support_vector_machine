I decided to go with the harbor theme because it reminds me of Maine, where I love to go.  some people have been pressuring me to get a blog *cough*Tiffany*cough*, and actually post meaningful things in it, actively. This time I will stay active in the blog. Ok, enough about this...  Tommorow, I'm leaving for a one week vacation to virginia beach. Im going to miss everyone at IS (Imusion Studios, basically my second home), but they will know I'm having a fun time. I can't wait to get there, I need to get everything off my mind and just have a fun time, thats all I want. And I also get a chance to hang out with my cousins who I don't see very much... this will be the best vacation I have ever taken.   So now I'm supposed to be watching my sister while my mom is at the gym. I've pretty much neglected that but I do check up on her. She just turned 4, but I've taught her to look after herself. When my mom comes home I will probably go biking around the street and the neighborhood, maybe hang out with some friends, and then I will have to pack later...  Well thats about all I have to say for right now.   Chris    Currently Listening To:  The Eagles- Desperado  Current Mood:  content
