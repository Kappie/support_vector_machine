I assume you all have probably seen The Matrix Revolutions... yes.. If you haven't there's nothing you desperately need to go see either... But anyway,   *SPOILER WARNING* - although slightly late and pointless  but if my small and crap program is about 50 lines of code, and all it does is calculate the answer to a quadratic equation, and remember this is in a high level language, not something like binary :/  how much would the oracle take to write???  ...  Go figure...  Bleh :/
