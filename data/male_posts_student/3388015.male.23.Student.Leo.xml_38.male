We just walked to the Finacial Aid office and that dude that was so rude to me when I took summer course was there to help.  He's so apathetic and demeaning.  You tell him you need one thing and he'll tell you that you need something else.  You tell him you want one thing and he'll hand you forms without seeing if you've filled them out.  I don't like him, but they keep him because they have high turnover there.  So I wonder what tonight will bring, I don't have any plans.  All I know is it's 5:00 and I'm done for the day!
