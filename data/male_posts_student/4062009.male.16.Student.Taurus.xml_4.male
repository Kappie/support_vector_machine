Well mainly because every 5 to 10 mins in the game I got shot in the head by a sniper. I must say that after a while it becomes a real pain. You know what I mean.   Anyway, now I am bored! I don't know what to do and my dad will be home soon. (Joy... lol) Maybe I shall just surf the web or see what other Blog sites are up too. I don't know... Maybe I just might start reading...   ...   ... Nah... Well I guess I will go now. There is not much for me to tell you anyway. I don't even know why I am posting this. I guess I just feel like it. LOL! Later!      Wolfwood
