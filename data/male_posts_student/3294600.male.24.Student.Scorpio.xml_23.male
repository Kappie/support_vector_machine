I have NO clue how I'm going to memorize 18 rules by Wednesday. There is a quiz and a test in Logic that day. Those are coming after two tests in hardware on the same day.August 13th can't get here fast enough.  I was so tired after classes today, I came home andtook a nap from 3:30 PM to 9:45 PM. Itwas much needed, but I'm still not rested.   Daleate dinner and then plopped mine on the table and said, "Your dinner is on the table, it's there if you want it." He turned off all the lights and went to bed. I don't know what his problem was tonight. He seemed okay when he first got home, but he was moody when I tried messaging him on Yahoo! *shrug* Guess I'll try talking to him tomorroow. It probably didn't help that I messaged him and said, "Why you being an ass tonight?"  I'm looking forward to this weekend; I'm going up to Vancouver, BC with David and possibly Becky and Donna depending on how Becky is feeling. She had a heat stroke in Idaho and hasn't been doing too well. :( I really need a break from school and this might get me rejuvinated for the last two weeks of school.  Well, I have more logic to do before bed, so I should probably close for now. Keep me posted on how you're doing and who's actually reading this. I have no clue if this is just a venting place or if people actually read. :P   Hope all is well with you (whoever is out there).  Jason
