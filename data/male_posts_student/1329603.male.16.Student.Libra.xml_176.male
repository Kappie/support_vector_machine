In the case of my blog, the vicious circle is only self-explanatory if you happen to be me. Around 6 billion people have the privelidge of this not being true. So, read on, Macduff...  I don't like being unhappy. Even moreso, I don't like making people unhappy by telling them that I'm unhappy, or by making people feel responsible for my mental state (which is deteriorating, mostly as a result of illness and over-work). And it is because of this I feel guilty for posting depressed-sounding posts on here. This sparks a further depression, which puts me into a cycle I cannot escape. I guess, for me, talking things through is not an option, because it furthers the problems. I hate sounding 'whiny', or in general, I hate complaining. I prefer to be optimistic... I guess sometimes it's hard.  I got the trombone score for Gigi (musical I'm getting Â£90 for playing in) today... it's handwritten >_ any  of the practices though... perhaps a downside?  Oh, and I found out that what is a short-term goal for me, getting into the National Youth Orchestra, would mean I'd have to leave NJAN, in all probability, because they meet over 2-week periods at Christmas, Easter, and in the summer. I think the word that comes to mind is "bugger".  This is going to further the cycle but I'm still feeling alone and confused. The major problem is it's not just one person who sparks my confusion. This makes me feel worse. And... I'm still ill.  Quote of the day: "When your goodnights have been said, And you are lying in bed, With the covers pulled up tight, And though you count every sheep, You get the feeling that sleep Is gonna stay away tonight. That's when you hear it coming, That's when you hear the humming Of that midnight train, Here again, Can't explain that midnight train, That midnight train..."
