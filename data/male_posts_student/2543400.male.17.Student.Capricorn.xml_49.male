And since i found out how to manipulate myself so i can change I am gonna do this.  Anways, SBC Yahoo is a bitch for multiple computers. Can't have internet hosting anymore. What a bitch! But I'm gonna install OpenBSD on my box to store my code and private stuff. you know just for safe keeps as a server. Was thinking about FreeBSD 4.10, but then thought it'd be better if I used a secure OS just for the hell of having a secure system.
