The experience is truly new to me. In my distance past, I remember someone talking about how people sleep with each other not only for the sex, but also for the closeness and intimacy of being near another human being. Then I scoffed at the idea, thinking it was just an excuse for lust, but I think I've tasted a bit of that intimacy during our slow dances. It is worth repeating.  I feel sorry for the people who wrote in  The Matrix and Philosophy . If only they waited until the end of the trilogy, they would have a greater understanding of the whole Matrix-universe as well as more quotes to base their argumentation on. Even so, this book rocks. I'm learning many new philosophic words and theories. Some like mine; some not.   Fast dancing intrigued me. It is purely hedonistic (like that?  The Matrix and Philosophy  taught me). There is no reason to do it except for the sexual pleasure inherent within. Of course, I sound like some eccentric old goat, complaining about the fashions and materialism of today's youth. But objectively, I see no reason to rub one's buttocks against another's groin except for sexual purposes. But maybe that's just me.
