Today, the radio station said it's Wednesday, and my brother's clock (which is hooked up by radio to this clock that's supposed to be never wrong) said that it's Wednesday. But I don't remember living tuesday, and my computer says it's tuesday, and my little brother has soccer practice on tuesdays, but not mondays, and there was no soccer practice yesterday, AND all of my previous posts say Monday or sooner! I am going insane! Maybe I'll call my mother...    ps: thanks, Kimmy!
