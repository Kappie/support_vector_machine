Okay first of all im in band! yup its true after a little negotiating i'm in band, though not very high ranking, who cares?! im in band and i get to go to grand nationals and state champs and the whole schiznit! yup so cool, though its like a probationary membership since i can be pulled out in an instant by my parents if i dont plan and finish my eagle project in time. but its summer, im sure i got enough time to complete an eagle project...  on another note, instead of going to computer tech camp in silicon valley *cough*nerd*cough* i get to go to hawaii! woo its so cool cuz, i've never been there and now im gonna just jet over for some fun in da hawaiin sun for 10 days.  of course both of these perks comes at a cost. i have to quit my job during august and beyond because i wont have time to fit it all into my schedule. well technically besides august i can do, but my parents feel that that will overload my schedule and not allow me to maintain high-ish grades if i spend my time working on top of band-ing, school-ing, and other stuff-ing...so yea, gotta leave my friends at work *tear* though many of them are going off to college anyways...well a lot of the cool ones...  on the topic of work today brian and anthony also applied to get a job where i work. though its funny cuz they took like 40 min over the recommneded time limiit, which was about 20 minutes...sooo they went over and took about an hour to complete a simple skills assesment test. in any case i hope they get their job for the only amount of time they can work...lik one month, cuz like me they have to quit in august anyways.  i think thats about it...oh and if you ppls are wondering about my website...which im sure you're not, its not really under construction right now. i mean i had to build and maintain a site for a certain purpose and that purpose has been served so now i gotta turn my attention to like...doin other important stuff, and i'll update my site when i can, or i feel not so lazy.  ummm and on another tangent im taking english 11 cp during summer school.   BLEH!!!  anyhow its easy so far, only been watching a movie on the crucible and taking study guide notes from it, instead of actually reading the book...i must say a smart teacher *cough*. anyways i hate that, but yea who wouldnt, damnit i shoulda done better during the school year...well whatever, peace out my ppls.
