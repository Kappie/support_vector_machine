Ugh, went back to sleep and felt very groggy when i woke up at 6.30 am...  7.40 am - BM Pandemonium... It was obviously my group's turn to present our Anak Laut in front of the class ( Being Group 1 and having Haikal inside, it was SO obvious...) It turned out ok, except for a few minor problems with Abu's voice. Saravanan said our group did well ( which can be good OR bad... ) and the period continued with noise, chaos and havoc.  9.30 am - Additional Math and Additional Problems... Add Maths started late, as Mr Tan hurriedly teached us after collecting our homework. Ezra continued to squirt water to people using a liquid paper pen ( thank goodness i was not involved...) Suddenly, Jia Jen's groin started to glow and blink...( READ ON...IT IS NOT SICK...) Mr Tan then forced JJ to give it to him. At first, JJ refused, but later, he gave Mr Tan the blinking pen ( told ya it wasnt sick...)Add Maths was quite boring, and it could not get any worse when he gave us homework...  10.00 am - Recess... I walked to my cursed duty place...the Herbal Farm. Nothing much to do there, just staring at flowers, seeing red ants, staring at flowers again...And then, Niklas appeared as he made his rounds. With the perverted king around, it was not SO bad...as he spotted dragonflies mating! It was very interesting, as two dragonflies were busily flying as they mated while another kept forcing the male ( or female ) to get off...Must be a 'hubungan sulit-lah!'  12.00 pm - Chemistry...ugh It was Randip and Ridhwan's turn to 'teach' us today. My, was it a bore! They talked about Ikatan Ion, and they made the boring topic even worse. Although so, they were not to blame, as my class was already busy playing since 10.15...Cik Masnira was not happy with our class ( as usual...) and I backed up by helping to tone the class down ( which eventually did not work )  Well, not much interesting things to talk about today, no perverted stories and Weng stories. In the future, for sure! Hehe...
