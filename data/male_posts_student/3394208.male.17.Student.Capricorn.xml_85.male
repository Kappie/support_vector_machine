It's alright   Doin this shit all day long   Trippin out, smoking out with the   Ganja Song      You know how we'll feel when it starts to roll   Stuff it real tight then it's time to go   We'll be Jammin 24/7 or until we pass out   Always got stash especially on beach night-outs   Got enough beers to match our dope   Open the hot box and spread the air with beautiful smoke   That's it I'm cool I'm already buzzing   I don't care if I'll feel like shit in the morning   Been doin this so very fucking long   Trippin out smokin out with the   Ganja Song
