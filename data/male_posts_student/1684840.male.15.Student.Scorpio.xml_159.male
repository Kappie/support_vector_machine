I recieved the money by Paypal and sent it straight to my mum to put in her bank so I could get it in my hand   I have got lots of spending money for Alton Towers now!  The bids on eBay aren't doing too well yet, but the printer has had 3 bids so far!  More money hehe   There's only 3 and a half weeks left at school and I can't wait for Summer.  Anyway, today I went out with Sam, Craig, Jo, Annie and we just walked around and and watched a bit of Shrek etc.  It was a bit rainy - but who cares!   I've spent most of the day installing things back onto my computer.  My horroscope couldn't have been more wrong when my money score was rock bottom heh!
