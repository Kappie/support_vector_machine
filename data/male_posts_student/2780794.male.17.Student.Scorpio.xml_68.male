At press time, a depressed call from a fan of the SP floorball team reported that she had seen Muhd Near Farhan mingling with gals and a friend known only as Tanni-baram. She was upset at the goalie's state as she saw him obviously high on tanni with a huge beer belly taking a taxi from Serangoon Rd. Her name has been withheld to protect her identity and she wish he would be severely dealt with and at the same time be fit enough again for IVP and win honours for SP. -=]admirer kape?[=-  Rumours have also been rife about the fitness levels of the goalkeepers of SP being drastically low. Some players have even given a public outcry that it is unfair that they do not participate actively in warmups as well as physical training. An unnamed player reportedly said " *%*^*%$. Those goalies only know how to save balls. When they tired,they sub. They like so relax sia. We train like siao, they train like pussies in a well. *$*%*^%!!!!!!" However, some players  are perfectly fine with it. Another unnnamed player reportedly said that "as long as they do not concede goals like barthez or leak goals like they neva wear pad then ok lahz. aiyah, i no problem one."
