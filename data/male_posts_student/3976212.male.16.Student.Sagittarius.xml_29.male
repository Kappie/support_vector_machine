Today we went to Nanaimo (what else was I gonna do?) and we went to the stupid mall (rutherford) and they got their haircut. I was hungry so I asked my dad before he went in for his haircut for something to eat. I suggested a protien bar. He thought it was a great, cheap idea. I go and get one and the total was $3.09 (after tax) and my dad flipped out right there in the store! Zellers only charged 2 cents cheaper for them-I checked while they where getting their haircuts. I know walmart sells them for 2.40 and superstore sells them for about 2.50. He literally flipped out about 50 cents! Hell, if I had my wallet at the time I would have paid just to shut the beast up. But he made a fool of himself in the nutrition store. After that my father wanted to check his lottery tickets so he did that and I went with my brother Ryan to Sears. We specificly told him to meet us in sears. We waited, and waited, sat down on a couch and waited in total maybe 25 minutes? We finally gave up and walked back to the van, where my dad was sitting! I asked him why the hell he had still not come to see us. He didn't even listen. He freaked out and started yelling at me and ryan because "we didn't tell him to meet him in sears". I can't believe it. He was then a total asshole until (him driving now) we get to the superstore. I was waiting in the van with ryan so I got in the driver seat and practiced my parrelel parking. I was getting really pissed off at Ryan because he wouldn't stop talking! He just talks to me because he has no friends. And he talks a lot. Anyways, finally my dad comes back (he only got bacon and coke) and it took him over half and hour. While waiting for him to finish smoking his ciggerette, I got so pissed off at my brother that I moved my hand right up close to his face. He leans over and pretends that I hit him. Now my dad says "I heard a slap and everything!" which is impossible because he is half deaf anyway. Him and Ryan where complete assholes on the way home, especially Ryan saying insane things like "Richard told me that he was pissed off that you bought bacardi instead of smirnoff last time"...he knows i'm having trouble convincing my dad that I don't steal his liquor...especially after the "insodent". I actually think Ryan is trying to frame me, Ryan knows my dad puts his Vodka in the freezer cause he likes it cold. One day he asked me if I had been stealing it and replacing it with water because it was frozen. Maybe he just takes it and blames me?! Whatever, once we got home my brother and I got in a huge fight...Well actually I was trying to cook a hamburger and he wouldn't leave me alone. (remember how loud he is? I'm gonna have to record him one day just to show)
