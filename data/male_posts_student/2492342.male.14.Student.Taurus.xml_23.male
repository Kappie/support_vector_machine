Mhm, aisha, i think we're gonne have to change the running to mexico thing to when im 17 and just done with high school- i doubt ill be free at 16.   mhm....  brighton has some eating problem. i dont know anything about it, except that its horribly odd happening days before some assembly on anorexia and bulemia. khoda, this is one of those truman show moments. thats an awesome movie.  mhm..me and sam talked awhile after we got out(we have free last so we get out early..now brighton does too)...not the most interesting conversation. jennifer made sex noises at spanish break while catherine rubbed her back. nice  Yay, my parents dont come back til tomorrow....freedom. sort of. itd be better if i was fully alone. i wish...  hm, something funny happened today. brighton said 'whats up' er whatever in the hall, and i started to reply but i saw DJ and raN away. im scared of him sort of.  mhm..havent talked jasenko in the longest time...nor a bunch of other people. oh well. its not like i really care about most of them.   12 mins left...  today was nice....but i looked like crap, again. not that i look ok often. but today was crap day. as opposed to a shit day. TTomorrow no school. yay. Thank God.  We talked about drugs in human. i think cortney lied to me a lot of the summer about everything that happened....fuck her for that. a lot of my summer was crappy for her. i seriously doubt she overdosed and was raped...like 5 times..anymore. mhm, she was so sad and believable too. oh well. bitch. the only reason is that andie and dyna  said some things...which led me to believe shes a liar. so anywyas, onwards...  This one guy is scared of me cause i told him im communist. lol. on the prez debates last night, kucinich got more applause than any of the other candidates. only one time when he talked was he not applauded. but no one is gonna vote for him anyay, sadly. poor guy. and he had to live inc ars pasrt of his childhood too.  im gonna walk to the store with ceci after school today i think. im not sure if ill have enough energy to make it tho.   oo...lol....it says on the board in the front of the room that u cant use these comps for anyhting but research and typing. i thought afterschool anything was ok. oh well. the senile librarian has to see it before she can end me to o'brien, no?  i have 4 minutes left. im gonna go on NS for like 2, than pack up my stuff and make sure my abuela doesnt come looking for me.  i hate the word grandma. doesnt abuela sound kinder? and less senile?  much love  peace  ~alex  'life is a bitter tune with sad refrain'
