When my psyche is in doubt, and my deeper sub-conscious mind speaks one of the choices, I began to wonder if that is what is what my soul finds as right.  I'm hesitant on going with that though, because I'm not sure if it is my soul speaking to me, or just random thoughts, thrown together in a pattern that pleases me.  Poor me. Poor, Poor me.  Today, I went to to the mall with Nia and mom.  I first checked out the game store, got two games I wanna get in the near future.  Then I went to my eye exam, I saw the doctor who knows alicia again.  weird.  Then I went to the book store, and looked up and down the religion section, and using my new random and mutating spiritual mind, I dared to look at the new age section.  Most of the stuff was utter crap, but they throw every non-Christian/Jewish/Muslim/Buddhist book there. I saw some book on Shiva there, and was like "Whoa, that's a disgrace, putting this book with devangari all over it in the New age section" but I let that off my mind and looked at the really interesting book on I-Ching.  I really wanna learn more about that.  Then I passed by this very interesting book title "Is God the Sun?" very interesting thought in a modern context.  Enough about books!  My sister had a pre-liminary confirmation service.  I was like the only confirmed child there, so I kinda walked around in the fellowship hall.  Mr. Harewood saw me, and was nice as usual.  He asked me if I could drive, and I said "No" he started to laugh, and Mr. Gooding started to talk about how he could drive when he was 12 in Jamaica.  It is so nice how those guys treat me with respect, and don't talk down to me.  It really made me feel good.  The service itself was slightly boring until they got up to the foot washing.  The assistant pastor, who is the leader of the confirmation class, washed every confirmee's left foot.  Then each of them washed the right foot of the person to their right.  The significance of the ritual has practical application.  As Joe said "I liked having my feet washed, but didn't like to wash others feet." and the Asst. Pastor said "If it was hard for you, imagine the significance of Jesus humbling himself."  Interesting.   Syracuse won, Lauren came over to watch.  It's gonna be Kansas/Syracuse in the Finals, but sadly Kansas is gonna take all.
