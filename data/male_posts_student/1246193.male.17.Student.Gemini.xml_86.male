I do believe that it was my first time at a protestant wedding and I found it very interesting. I was amused several times when the minister would be interuppted during the exchange of vows by shouts of "AMEN!". I was also slightly embarrased when everyone stood to sing and my family,who occupied the first two rows, where the only people that I could see who weren't singing. Though, I suppose there were a few other catholics there who weren't singing either. The music was really awesome. As we entered the church we were greeted by a bagpipe player-again with the scottish thing. A violin, cello, and piano played some pretty little ditties before the wedding. The bride entered the church to the sound of a trumpet. The songs that we didn't sing were accompanied by a guitar and a bongo drum. The bride and groom entered the reception following the bagpipe player again. And lastly the background music for the reception was light jazz by a piano player and a trumpet. As I said, the music was awesome.   The first thing we did when we got to Chicago was to take my grandparents to the church. I saw my cousins who were also two of the eleven bridesmaids and were hungry. We got food and returned to the church. I couldn't find them but I had seen them go up some steps and through a door so I thought they might be up there somewhere. I went up the steps and through to door only to be stopped by a very pregnant woman asking me what I was doing. I told her and she told me that I couldn't come in because it was the brides dressing room. She took the food-I hope she gave it to Maureen and Andrea.   The reception was unique. For a catholic marriage, a reception is more than just a place where you meet the bride and groom. It is a place where you get piss-ass drunk, dance, and just generally party until the wee hours. (My last cousin's reception ended at about six in the morning) Apparently that isn't what they do at all protestant receptions. There wasn't any alcohol, they don't believe in drinking, there wasn't any dancing, I don't know if they don't believe in dancing or what. The time instead was occupied by speeches: one from each of the maids of honor(making two), one from each of the best men(making three), one from two of the brides uncles(making two), two from one other uncle(making two), one from the father of the bride(making one), one from the bride and groom themselves(making one)--a total of eleven speeches. Then there was an enjoyable movie and the reception was over. It also ended at about six, but it was six in the evening.   As I said, it was a unique and interesting experience, but still a very enjoyable time. Congratulations to the two of them.   (My cousin, Danny Fahl, and I were being a bit ornery and we signed the guest book, well actually these little cards that will be put in the guest book, "To our cousin Craig...Good luck tonight! Danny and Andy") Our parents found it very amusing, Craig will find it amusing, but I'm not sure how the bride will take it.
