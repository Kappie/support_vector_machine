After that, to my surpirse, I saw Jiahao... He decided to stick with us... Then Daniel reached... He's late for 10 mins or so... Went in... The place seem big...   Just sang cheers and played games only... Only game that I like was that the blindfold and find shoes... Hard to describe how the game goes... Have some lousy lunch... Free de... Cant expect much... Jiahao didnt avoid me like last time le... Cuz me and him got a past but now it seems fine... Before everything ended, exchange number with quite some guys from our class... Jiahao same class as me.. Then hor the Burhan also... I fucking ass bitch boy dare be in same course as me and same class... Damn sianz...  Anyway, tomorrow got another orietation, dont know if I want to attend mahz since it's so early...  Singing out - Ronald
