Baby when you hold me, do you feel it?  Should I believe the magic in your eyes?  I'll be waiting till the end of time To hear you say you love me, like you mean it  Baby when you hold me, make me feel it  All I wanna do is make you mine  I've been hurt way too many times   Again and again and again i've been hurt my friend till the end  And though i've been high i've been low i got no place left to go  Again and again and again when will this searching end  great song =D   Happy B'day Ken!! ^^   was puffing while walking/rushing to the train station in the morning..maybe i should go see a doctor =S  been looking through some of those university prospectus's...hmm..i kinda know what im kinda aiming for now...the UAC gives you 9 choices...so my 9 choices with their 2004 UAI cutoffs atm would be: 1.
