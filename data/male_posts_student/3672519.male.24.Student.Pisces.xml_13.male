Have to cut hair and get a tan. I thrive on the hum of mild panic.    Its going be my final year, and there's only one thing I know with absolute certainty: all hell shalt break loose. For hopefully the last year in a long time I will be sleeping less, playing less, reading less, exercising less, dating less (not like I did much of all this in the first place), snacking more, smoking more, pc-gaming more, worrying more, whining more and weighing more.    You see, in this profession it is said that the worse years of your career are spent in the uni. I cling to this hope like oxygen.
