"jason (or ren san-mandarin or yun san-cantonese)... i want to introduce you to... ".  it's at that point that i give a little smile and try to transition to another topic... but it's already too late.  everyone joins in... and i just listen... and it goes on for a good 45 minutes at least.  ok... maybe... and hopefully it won't come to this... if i were like 36 years old... and i was in danger of becoming a true dirty old man... then... maybe help would be ok.  but i think the cut off is at the least like 33.  i don't even know what i'm doing with my life yet... everything's contingent on if i get into a pharm program right now... and if that doesn't happen... well... i don't know.  if i can't rely on myself... how is anyone else going to rely on me?  we'd be done in about 10 minutes.  of course... if you want to be my sugar mamma... the position's still open!  ok enough with that.  new news... good news for the most part.  i bought 2 new hard drives... 8 meg cache... totally makes a difference.  i was able to pull off some data from my dysfunctional hard disks.  i got back dreamweaver mx and flash mx which i had desperately needed for a possible web design job... and i got back some mp3s... and my most current palm data (i had not synced in awhile and the batteries ran out to my palm).  it's not total good news... cause i think for the most part i've lost all my south park stuff... and i'd say 70% of my mp3s.  the method i used to recover was interesting.  you stick the hard disk in the freezer for 2 hours or more (wrap it in an anti-static bag and put that in a ziploc)... have your new hard drive handy... take out your frozen drive... and transfer you old stuff over to your new one.  this method only works if your drive's read heads are damaged.  sometimes through use, the heads end up expanding from the heat over time.  when you freeze the drives... it shrinks the heads back to a size that they can function at again... though it will only be functional for a short period of time.  this method worked great for 2 of my drives.  i was able to keep these 2 up for 30 mintes... enough time to transfer the contents of my old c drive, and my /var/httpd, /home/jchow directories, and some misc linux config files on my linux disk.  my third disk full of mp3s and iso solaris files, odd todd cartoons, and south park seasons did not fare as well.  so that was disappointing... since this was the disk with the most info.  oh well...  now i must sleep.  petition coming soon... promise.  night.
