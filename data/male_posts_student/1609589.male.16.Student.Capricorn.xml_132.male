I asked them about music, and they dismissed it as "a distraction." This is not true. Well, for some music. Rap/country/rock DOES fit into the "distraction" category. Rock has always been a distraction for me.  Jazz, Electronic(i hesitate to call it techno or trance, because it isn't either of those things), Blue Man Group... all great stuff.  I asked them "What if you make your own music?" and they dismissed THAT is "Making your own distraction." I guess that's another reason I'm not buddhist. Without music, I would go insane.  "Needing something... desire... Nirvana is a place without desire." that's what they said. Humans don't work without desire. It just doesn't happen.  My inspirations music-wise-  Pat Metheny group- Vocals don't ALWAYS mean lyrics- if you repeat a mistake, it's not a mistake.  Blue Man Group- Be different- don't take society seriously- don't have an ego whenever possible.  Steely Dan- Grooves make the world go round- Make people think about what you're saying.  Venus Hum- Laptops can be musical too.  That's all I can think of for now... I'll upd8 later.
