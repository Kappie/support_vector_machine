Then in the evening I watched 'Starship Troopers 2' which I '"ordered" off the net; it was really good quality cos it was DivX, yay!  And today ' H  a  r  v  e  s  t   M  o  o  n  :   I  t  '  s   a    w  o  n  d  e  r f u   l   L i  f   e ' had already arrived before I woke up, I woke up around 10:30, and I only just stopped playing now, I've been snacking to maximize game time, and now I'm considering going nocturnal, this is one of the best games I've played in a long time.
