Then kidney stones came up in our conversation along with Tom Hanks and him having a kidney stone in the movie "The Green Mile." Well, we're saying you can get kidney stones out by radiation and Eric goes "Or you can just have that big black guy suck it out." We were all disgusted and then started cracking up when Eric says "No no no, I ment he uses his power to suck the the kidney stones out of him." And then we started cracking up. He didn't relize it sounded wrong. We got back to my house, Dave left and now we're all watching the Matrix. Also, Pat buried himself in Sports Plus tokens. What will happen tonight? I have no clue, I didn't have any homework this whole weekend because it's the end of the quarter. Well, I had to buy oaktag for my social studies group for some project we're doing but that's all. I guess I'm just going to sit around doing nothing the rest of the night. Good Bye.  Wait! Wait! Don't Go! One more thing, "NYC" in capitals in the font Wingdings are 3 symbols. First is a skull and bones, then the star of david which resembles jewish and lastly, a thumbs up. I've known this for a long time, I just never told anyone. The meaning of it is Jewish people dying is good. Also, type "Q33" in capitals with only the Q capitalized, leave the 3's and put it in wingdings font. Spooky isn't it?
