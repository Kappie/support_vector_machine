A lot of people have been sick, including 2 people on the basketball team just a few days ago.  It really doesn't help.  So I went home after 5th hour.  I had to walk home because no one could pick me up.  It felt like forever walking home.  It seemed like an hour it took me to walk.  Usually it seems like a few minutes, but I was just zonked out.  I got home and the first thing I did was jump in my bed.  I slept for about 4 hours I think.  I wasn't really hungry after that, but I ate some anyways.  I didn't eat lunch so I needed to eat.  I started to feel better after I moved around a bit after sleeping.  It was weird.  My nose feels like a faucet.  I can't get it to stop running.  That's pretty sick.  Anyways, yesterday was pretty good.  We beat Washington over at their place.  Final score was 69-68.  I was happy about that.  I think that's probably when I got what I have now.  There's a lot of guys just recovering from being out.  A lot of stuff floating in the air.  It seems like I've repeated myself, but I don't know.  I feel tired.  I'm going to bed.  Good night.
