It covers Error Identification, Completing the Text, Comprehension and Essay.  As for Arabic Placement Test, there are two type of paper. One is for students with no basic which only took 30 minutes while the other one is a two-hour paper. As the list indicates that I'm a non-Arabic student, I answered the 30 minutes paper which is really simple like what I've learned during primary school.  Tonight event would be the Opening Caremony officiated by Prof. Ismawi Zen, Deputy Rector for Developement. Tomorrow would be filled with briefings.
