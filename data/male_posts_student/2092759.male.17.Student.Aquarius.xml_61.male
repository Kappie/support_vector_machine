The conveyor belt off of the truck just became an unending stream of tacky junk. O well, its a good way of getting paid.   Onward to the nerdity: Be aware, the fallowing character evaluation contains some heavy spoilers concerning the Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale Batman graphic novels  The Long Halloween  and  The Dark Victory . I would suggest that anyone intrested in reading one of the best Bat stories ever told, go and pick up a copy. It really does give you insight into the mind of Bruce, Harvey and Jim. (Wayne, Dent and Gordon, for those of you not on a first name basis with the characters yet.)    The tenth greatest character in Comic Book history:    Alberto Falcone      The Long Halloween  is an integral stepping stone in the devlopment of Batman's character. Basically a drawn out explination for the destruction of Harvey Dent and the birth of Two-Face, however, what the novel does most beutifully is create and flesh out the crime families of the DC universe. Specifically, it focuses on the family of Carmine "The Roman" Falcone. Carmine is essentially a play of Don Corleonne, but where the story becomes interesting is with his son, Alberto.   Alberto Falcone is a Harvard graduate. A student at Oxford. One of the most intelligent young men in the city. He also happens to be the son of Carmine Falcone, head of "The Roman Empire", a criminal syndicate that has a hand in corruption from Metropolis to Chicageo and rules Gotham with relative ease. Despite, or in fact because of, all of the above Alberto has remained out of the family business. Whenever the chance arose to enter the work of his father, Alberto was rejected because his father felt that his future lay elsewhere.   To say the least, Alberto never really accepted this point of view. He was deeply ashamed that his sister was closer to his father, and entrenched in the underworld while he was left to the colleges and intelligista therein. The love of a father is an amazingly powerful influence, and the lack thereof can drive men to do far worse things then what Alberto had decided to do.    Beginning with the murder of the Roman's nephew, Johnny Vitti, on Halloween a series of unexplained murders of the formost denizens of the underworld strike the heart of the Roman Empire. Theories abound as more and more mobsters are claimed by the Holiday murderer, until Alberto is fakes his death on New Years eve. This draws the attention away from Alberto and onto other  suspects, leading to the events that eventualy destroy Harvey Dent's fragile pshyci. Alberto, using this whole fiasco to his advantage, continues to kill the members of his father's inner circle and his enemies. Alberto is the perfect Yin to Batman's Yang.    Bruce was seperated form his father as a child through violence, crime and death. Alberto was  regulated to the sidelines and seperated defacto from his father as a child through violence, crime and death. Bruce vents this anger into the criminal element. Alberto funnels this anger back into his father, as a way of compensating for abandonedment as a child. Holiday is Alberto's way of destorying the barriers between himself and his father. Batman is Bruces equally vain attempt to reconcile himself of his father's attention.     When Holiday is captured fallowing his attempted hit on his father's rival, Sal "The Boss" Maroni, he is brought into the custody of the GCPD, Jim Gordan and Batman. A few hours later, Carmine arrives. Now, you have to understand one thing about Mobsters in the DC universe. There is a fine line between Organized Crime and the Metahuman (I agree, its a lame name for beings with phenominal powers, but DC spends millions of dollars a year on this stuff, so who am I to disagree.) Criminals that are regularly fought by the Bat. As thin as this line is, its is bold and red with blood. The Mob hates the concept that a group of freaks with flashy clothes and weird monikers can usurp their power. The Freaks are, quite often, insane, so it matters little to them. The knowledge that his son has become Holiday, one of the corrosions of what he holds to be the tenets of society, severly upsets and airs the deep rift between the father and son. In the end,behind the mass murder, the colorful clues, and the underlieing seething anger he hold for his father, Alberto truely is Poppa's little boy who mearly wishes his daddy would invite him along on his "missions."
