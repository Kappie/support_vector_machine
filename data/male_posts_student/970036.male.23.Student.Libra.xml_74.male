I updated my reading list in the right column. I've polished off  LOTR: The Two Towers  while manning the phones at work, and with  LOTR: The Return of the King , I'll be completing the trilogy for the 3rd time. I'm still slogging my way through  Les Miserables , and I've decided to give  War and Peace  a 9th chance...here's hoping I at least get beyond the preface  this  time!    On Sunday Nicole and I headed down to Camrose, which I discovered is referred to as "The Rose City," though I didn't recognize "rose" was half of the city name until that point. Shades of the IHOP -> International House of Pancakes scenario with George in Vancouver. Anyways, their new-old house has a backyard to  die  for, and a hottub to  kill  for.    Which makes it almost as dangerous as our lovely new apartment!     Currently: Cramming in the final gooey nuggets of Religious Anthropology before the midterm.
