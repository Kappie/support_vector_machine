I started up this blog thingy a couple minutes ago, and am trying out this stuff for the first time.  Right now though, I hate misquitos because I'm allergic to them.  I get bit, and where they bit swells up all kinds.  It look like it hurts pretty good, but doesn't.  It's hot here, and I'm up @ 2 in the morning writing this stuff.  Tried calling Howie yesterday, but that didn't quite work out?  I know he tried calling here, but I was sleeping again.  Trav hasn't been around, and that's not very odd considering his situation these days.  If anything else happens today, I'll write more, but for now, I'm cutting it short.  Gotta get to at least attempting to rework the site every now and then.
