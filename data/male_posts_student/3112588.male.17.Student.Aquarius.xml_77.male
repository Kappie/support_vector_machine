LoL!! well, let me start off by saying that i wound up going to sara's b-day party last night, but had to leave early to take suzy home...the funniest thing about the entire night was when mr.juliani came into the dining room, and i was talking with laura and silas..and he goes: "every night is a birthday night @ silas's house" LoL!!!!!!! dude, laura and i were just about dying! they have so many freaking kids in their house, its like beyond crazy, but yeah...good times. talked with vanessa for a while and just chilled and watched the "Italian Job". we didnt get to finish watching it though, b/c they wanted to watch "Gothika", which im sorry--im not too keen on watching horror movies unless i have like someone there that will "protect me"...since laura had ryan, i was out of ppl!! LoL!! good stuff...so my mom came to pick us up, we dropped suzy off, and i just came home. talked to laura @ like 2am this morning for like 10 minutes, just to say hey and some other stuff. but yeah--today, suzy and i decided to go spend a few bucks at marina square...there's nothing there, but she wanted to hit up Old Navy, and i was like: ehhh ok. so we went over there, and my mom and i helped her pick out the CUTEST stuff ever..dude, like next time you see her, she's gonna be "smokin'!!" LoL!! so yeah, then we went to dinner, came back to my house for a few hours...chatted it up out on the balcony (thats like the best place to talk, i swear--other than counters hehe), and then took her home around like 9pm or so. all in all it was a great time to spend with suzy, and i got to know her better--so im happy. bored right now though--BUT I  GOT MY PHONE BACK  GUYS!!! SO HAPPY! so you can call me on my cell now too, kk? well, ill be online for a while tonight, so talk to me why dont ya'? bye!
