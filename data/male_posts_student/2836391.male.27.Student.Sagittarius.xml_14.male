She's been overseas for the past year, and before that I hadn't seen much of her for a while, we'd mostly communicated by email. So it was really great to see her again in person. We spent a good couple of hours chatting, catching up on family news, and just enjoying being in each other's company once again. Ali is one of my best friends, because she has always been there for me when I've needed her support. She has always been there to offer me advice when I've asked, and even when I don't listen to her, and do my own thing and stuff up, she doesn't say 'I told you so', she just helps me sort out my life again. I am so thankful that I have such good friends in my life, people who care about me no matter what the circumstances. I am really lucky in that way.
