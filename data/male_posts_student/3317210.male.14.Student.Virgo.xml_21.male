New Technique Coming Up!  Okay, while browsing the Daily Sketch Group, I have arrived at the conclusion that my previous method is good, but could possibly be more advance. Considering that in the world there is an infinite number of ideas and choices, letting my humble mind bumble down to only one conclusion is a little shallow. So, I am thinking of a new way to add some creative iterations. Categories include:     Time  - Future? Past? Present? Have a pick from the history of the Earth! You have a hunter,  Is he a hunter of the past, spear in hand wearing an outfit that would make Tarzan blush, Or is he from the not so past past, a knight armed with a traditional mace and chain, wearing heavy leather armour following tracks in the mud, Or even the present, (mad detective style) featuring multiple layers of magnifying glasses, wearing a slightly singed and dirtied suede jacket, staring at a group of select cards in his hand (lets say for insanity's sake its a joker who's got a sling shot, a queen just saved by a Prince only to find he is already married, and a king who has a suspiciously ominous shadow!) Or the future, with a sly female spy agent against a wall, pony tail wrapped into a tight spray of fine hair, lipstick in hand. Well, maybe that's going a little strange =)   Angles  - Smooth? Sharp? Angles exhibit the creators geometrical fascinations, and is commonly used in evil instruments and architecture, while smooth may exhibit the plump face of a friendly barman.   Ample?  - Is the character fat (wealth, carelessness for personal image) or thin (undernourished, poor, self-conscious)   Movement  - Is it a slow lumbersome movement, meaning great mass or age, or a quick darty movement, emphasising youth and agility.   Social Class  - Rich, poor, famous, common. All these influence certain characteristics about them. Could you imagine a poor dragon, who ends up using passed down flames or burrows =P   Fusion  - Already got a goblin? Throw a crown into the mix, ta-da! Goblin King, owner of the deeps, danger of the wealthy travellers.   Antithesis  - You have a kind old bunny rabbit, carefully sitting ontop of a present, happy to see the world go by... Boring right? Well, ok, a fat mean bunny rabbit, who is viciously ripping apart your present, pieces of wrapping paper flying into the air like a spray of limbs =P   Human Or Animal  - Are they based on mainly human or mainly animal characteristics... Earl Bird? etc etc  Anyway, got to go, dad's about to rip my head off...
