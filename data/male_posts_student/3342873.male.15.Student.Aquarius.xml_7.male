Would love to celebrate it properly, but alas, no money. Why can't they, and with "they" i'm referring to the elusive, unkown, always-present, mysterious 'them'. Why can't "they" give or reward success with free booze? If a south african achieves something, shouldn't we celebrate, or at least congratulate? Anyway, ignore this as just the woes of a troubled mind. And remember alcohol is actually bad for you. *sigh* Wish someone would read this and be kind...
