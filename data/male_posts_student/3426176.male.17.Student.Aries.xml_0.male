That's 1:00 PM for those who don't speak European.  The weather was annoying because it was warm and sunny, then it would get cold and rainy, then warm and humid, then cold and cloudy, then drizzle, then pour, then sunny, then pour again, then sunny......  We played a fun little game where you had to shoot the ball off the crossbar and kick it in the goal on the volley.  I did it once and seriously screwed up my hip flexor.  Then we started making bets trying to hit various objects off of various posts from various angles from various distances.  We were just looking for stuff to do.  If more people showed up we could have scrimmaged. (Practice Wednesday at 13:00 on Fedora Field)  I was driving home and more crazy weather struck.  The skies opened up and I was driving through a wall of water.  I could not see a damn thing.  The streets were flooding and the windshield wipers weren't wiping fast enough.  I was driving under black clouds then suddenly everything was clear.  Blue skies, white fluffy clouds, and sunshine greeted me after I drove past watery hell behind me.  Random thought:  I really like those "Fanta" commercials.  The song is quite catchy.  Much to my dismay Xavier Malisse lost in the fourth round 7-5, 6-2, 7-6 (8-6) to 12th ranked Lleyton Hewitt in the French Open today.  He still can win some hardware for he advanced to the fourth round of the men's doubles championship.  The same goes for Virginia Ruano Pascual.  She lost in the fourth round, but advanced to the quarters of the women's doubles championship.  Another random thought:  I was just watching "X-Play", a show about videogames, and I just learned that a "weinernut" is a hot dog in the shape of a doughnut with the hole of the doughnut as a basin to hold cheese, relish, ketchup, and mustard.  Wow.  Just when I thought they made everything...  Now I must go.  I have alot to do tomorrow morning.  Bye.
