Actually i read that Laloo had said that God only must save the passengers of Indian Railways.He had said that God Vishwakarma must save the passengers as he is the god of machines. That He is the real minister and laloo is just donning his mantle.What will the communists with strong "Anti-Hindu-God" belief do now?. Will they withdraw the support to the congress Government as it has openly become communal- one of its most important minister has invoked the name of god. They were holding the secularist's flag high when the Saraswathi Song was played by the Previous Govt. But now Vishwakarma has been Invoked n running the ministry. Atleast the previous govt only prayed to god. This Govt is truly god sent as it partners with the god and is a representative of Him.
