Momma take this badge off of me I can't use it anymore It's getting dark, too dark to see Feel I'm knockin' on heaven's door   Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door  Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door  Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door    Momma put my guns in the ground I can't shoot them anymore That long black cloud is coming down I Feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door   Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door  Yeah, yeah, yeah [4x]  this song is a soft and comforting song for me when I feel sad and feel like there's no hope etc.. I love it and hope you do to.
