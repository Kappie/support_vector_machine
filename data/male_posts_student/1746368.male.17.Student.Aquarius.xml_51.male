I had to stay a little bit awake today because we had a pop-quiz. Luckily he did not count it against our grade, in fact, we did not even have to turn it in, or grade it. Than we did more things on notation and that stuff. I did all of it before he even had a chance to explain the first section. Than I went around and helped the people closest to me, since they were struggling. A few more people have finally asked me if I am even in college. So now there are like a total of 3 people in that class who know. I don't really care if people know, just in the past I have had some problems with age discrimination. It really gets on my nerves, but I don't generally talk about it. Maybe I will tell it later to fill in some black space. For right now I won't. I shall be talking to all of you later. Why do we have millions of laws to enforce the 10 commandments?  **EDIT** By the way, I typed this up pretty fast and I finally got to the point where I had no errors and did not have to go back on any of my typings. W00T!
