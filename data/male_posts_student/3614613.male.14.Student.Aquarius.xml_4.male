Anyway the scout thing is solved already, I have called joel john up and asked him for money. He's the type that would keep a huge store of money, so that it may be spent the next time people like him go out to have fun.  Er let's see, what else? I mean like what can I say there is nothing to say. I have been asleep after all. Oh okay, let's talk about this very site then. I got a new tagboard today, and I can't seeme to find a way so that it fits on the side bar. Looks like everything I want to add from now on will have to fit on top. Nevermind, so long as it works.  Hopefully I'll get my water bottle from jeanie tomorow... And eee, eeerr.... What else? Oh okay, this isn't some kind of court where I have to confirm the testimony of other people but yeah, I did play "shoot shoot" matrix game with li lin. It was like a gulp of sanity in a desolate and barren desert. I read that description somewhere. And er yeah, it WAS fun in a way. I did try doing the neo thing, and pretending to freeze all the bullets she shot and then flick them off the air.  Oh and, if you people haven't noticed this already, Mr. David is losing his confidence... Such a small sentance yet...
