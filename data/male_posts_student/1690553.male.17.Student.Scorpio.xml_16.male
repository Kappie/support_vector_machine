Very user friendly - it actually have built-in tool tips in the watch. So no more guessing which one to press even when you don't have the manual.     This is my first Timex watch, I usually wears Casio Watches and the toughest too - this one is rated Water Resistant 100m. Before this only Water Resistant 50m. But then it doesn't matter 50m or 100m, I don't dive.
