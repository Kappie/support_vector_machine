On a much lighter note, we're all (me and the janitor) still braindead (tired, hungry, able to fuck watermelon).  The last thing I can remember from this week is something about a science project... I didn't have any ideas, I got an idea from a friend, the teacher (Mr. Cunningham) didn't like it, and now I'm back to square one.  All the good ideas involve mass quantities of chemicals, petri dishes, incubators, plants, and the focus that I just don't have.  My (not really mine) idea you ask?  Sunscreen testing... You put different types of sunscreen on those glow-in-the-dark stars (I'm 13, how else would I measure light?) and introducing the sunscreen to different conditions. If you know me, you know how pale I am.  So sunscreen is just about the most ironic thing I could do. It's like if one of the most innocent and concentrated kids in my class (let's say Jesse) did a project on how fast you could hotbox a squirrel with different types of weed...  Actually, that might work... Get a bad grade, blow smoke in the teacher's face, get a good grade, teacher gets high, teacher gets hungry, give the teacher some Fritos, get first prize.  I'm better off testing how long it takes me to get offered pot on Haight st when I put different looks on my face. Again, weed in the teacher's face, I win...  (I'm going too far on a marijuana tangent, forget everything I've said up to this point.)
