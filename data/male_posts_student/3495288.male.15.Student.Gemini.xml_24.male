Woke up super late, 7:35am!, my mother knocked on my door so hard and she even took the key to my door and opened it with a loud bang. She shouted at me and scolded me. Still a little sleepy, i woke up. Irritated and angry because i was still recovering from that evil flu and fever. Luckily she had signed the two letters, one is my M.C. the other is an excuse from P.E. (which was today). So off i went to the bath room and took a shower. I got dressed for school and i took my time going to school, slow and steady. When i reached the school gate, it was still opened but no one there cause the lower sec has gone back to class and the upper sec went for assembly at the hall, and went up to Mrs Angelina Tan, Please! she is not Angelic ok! she is god dame fussy and evil! but yet i still like her cause she very nice to me hahaha :P, she just gave me a stare and said, "Late ah you today. Long time never see you late. Why were you absent from school yesterday? huh? ok... if the prefects stops you just say that you have reported to me and make sure you come for  Detention  straight after school.", i just nodded my head and took out my tie.   Went up the stairs while wearing my tie. My principle saw me walking towards the hall she just looked at me and just waved her little finger. I walked to the back of the hall and joined my class. The talk from the vice-principle was so super  BORING ! he was talking about  Why We Come To School?  and  What Is Nice About Coming To School?  and blah blah.  Man! So the boring!  After that was the usual lessons. Many in class were asking why i did not come to school yesterday and all but i just ignored. Nothing special happened during the curriculum time. Well after school i had an hour of Detention infront of the  Dicipline Commitee  room. Sat there and faced Mr Siva. He keeps glancing and whenever he does that i make a funny face or just smiles. He got irritated and took a large book and covered my face. Many of the other kids who were serving detention laughed. I peeked to the side of the book and stared at him, he took another book and covered me again. Many laughed. Hehe.. for the first time in my whole secondary school life i have made my main  DICIPLINE MASTER  irritated and laugh...hahaha.   After an hour of cheekiness i went for Band. Well since today's attendence was WAY better so everyone had occupied most of the space so i had to play my tuba while  STANDING.  Yes its heavy well its nice to play while standing cause i have this feeling that i am a  TUBA SOLOIST  hahah. Well i conducted Arioso terribely. Well you all got to understand i am bad in conducting ok so please give me some time to practice. After band i went to Mcdonalds and ate a large fries with my juniors. Had lots of ice cream, hahah already got fever still eating ice cream haha. After that i send them home, walking ok!, than i go home lor. So now i am here typing this blog while listening to  CATS THE MUSICAL!  heheh well till here k. Take care! Bubbye.
