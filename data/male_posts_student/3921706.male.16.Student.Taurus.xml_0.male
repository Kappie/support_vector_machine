But my summer, at least the weekends, seem to be pretty full. Nothing planned for tomorrow yet but Sunday, I'm attending a BBQ. Then next Saturday, I'm supposed to go to a friend's graduation party even tho none of my friends, nor I, really want to go. Not because we don't necessarily like the person giving it but because we can smell the boredom from a mile away. Then I'm going to go see I, Robot that Sunday. And then the week after that is our annual congregation picnic and 2 days later, I finally leave for 2 weeks in good ol' Texas!! I don't know why but I'm not excited as one would think. I'm eager to go but the anticipation has died down and I don't think I'll really be antsy until the day before we depart. See? Told you my life was boring but interesting things do happen from time to time.         Not much else to say except I think the relationship between my mother  I will probably be slightly fractured for the rest of our lives. We just can't seem to see eye-to-eye on much these days and we have our peaceable moments but I don't ever think we'll be the best of friends. Don't get me wrong, I love my mother with ALL my heart  soul and would do anything for her but...I just don't ever see us being as close as a mother and son would/should be. I describe it best as this, she's good to me and bad for me. She's like watermelon seeds. My life is the watermelon. The seeds (my mom) are beneficial because without them, the watermelon (my life) wouldn't exist. At the same time, they're an inconvenience. In order to really enjoy the watermelon, you have to get rid of the seeds. So in order for me to get a full enjoyment out of life, I have to live my life separate from my mother.        I know I'm not a perfect angel and I've haven't exactly always made my mother proud but I've gotten to a point where I think I'll never make her be as proud of me as she is of my other siblings. She's constantly comparing me to my sisters and brothers and reminding me that they didn't act like I do when they were my age. They set a near-perfect standard for me to live up to and i seem to be constantly failing and at this point don't care. I am not my brothers and sisters, I am me and if my mother can't love me and accept me for me, then that's her problem. Who knows, maybe one day I'll make her extremely proud of me and she'll finally accept me as me but I'm not gonna break my back to do it. I love my mother 150% and always will no matter what she does to me but I realize I have to love her from a distance because the closerI get to her, the more I want to run away. And I'm gonnatry to work hardto maintain a harmonious balance between the two of us as long as I'm under her roof. I have to. If I don't and I allow her to continue to get under my skin, one of these days she's gonna push me to the limits and over the edge and I'm gonna exit stage left and never come back. Not saying I'll run away from home or anything but meaning the moment I do leave her household, she will know the next time she sees my face and hears my voice. And I don't wanna have that type of relationship with my mother. She's my hero, my inspiration for life and she's the motivation I have to fight through any adversity in my life. She's been through a LOT of %#!t in her life and dealt witha LOT of things that would have left people in a padded cell sitting in a straightjacket. But through it all, she's never lost the will to live and the will to fight and the will to love. And seeing me express my true feelings about her shows I don't want to have a hairline-fractured relationship with her. I would love it if me and my mother were closer but it will never be a reality because our own imperfections cause us to inevitably butt heads. SoI have to accept things as they are and cherish what relationship we do have. I may seem to be a walking contradiction and it mayseem as if my love for my mother could easily overpower the negative aspects of our relationship. But the reality of it all is that even if I never make my mother 100% proud, as long as she loves me no matter what and comes to ACCEPT me as I am, then I think we'll be just fine.I guess you could say our relationship is the epitome of "can't live with, can't live without."
