(just wait until your done reading this) ummm ya, today i got back from vegas. heres an over view ok-o? ok!   DAY NUMERO ONE-O: we got thurr and we went to the pools and junk actually we didnt go in the pools, we just lokoed at them (very refreshing to look at) oh yea, we stayed at the flamingo (i was the only one who didnt care for the hotel) and then we walked around some. went to excalibur and saw...whats it called....tournament of kings. its kind of like midevil times, but its called tournament of kings...you get the point...and then we walked back to the hotel.  DAY NUMERO TWO-O: wasnt too fun...we really didnt do to much, just sat by the pool. and i was missing my friends. i found out that vegas is no fun if there is no one your age to hang out with. i wouldve gone to the arcade (im not a big fan of video games) to meet some new people, but the hotel we stayed in didnt have one, so my hopes of meeting new people was shot down imediatly, then i realized i dont wanna meet new people in a completely different state. so i just went to the pool and ripped off my shirt only to reveal my 18 pack and my rock hard pecs of death and have every single member of the opposite sex stare at me in awe and amazment. and then i woke up =) umm ya...  DAY NUMERO THREE-O: i went to the pool and went to a buffet and went home yay!   (back to the 2nd day, my dad and i went to go see "sirens of TI" at treasure island, and holy crap on a stick my dear fellow friends....them sirens are muy caliente...i would let them sound my siren any day...ok enough with the horrid provokitive subliminal joke...) but ya...they wereso hot... k thats all gnight
