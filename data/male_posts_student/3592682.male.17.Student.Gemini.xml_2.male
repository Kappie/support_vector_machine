O Levels' coming and i'm rushing.. sometimes.. we feel like giving up.. but we'll come to realise that that would be a stupid choice.. however.. it seems to me like i've been thinking that way all these while.. Each time i feel really drained, i'll feel like giving up.. but i know that i should get it done and over with.. afterall.. the world is round.. by giving up, i'm jus leaving the problem/s there and one day.. it'll come back again.. I don't wan to waste such time.. Well.. i guess i'll just finish this year nicely and quickly.. hopefully, i won't come back again.. haha.. It's hard sometimes when u know that everyone in the world is ur competitor.. frm the day i entered this world.. i've started competing with everyone else.. esp when you enter schools and the world market.. you compete with knowledge.. for money, for post.. for almost everything in the world.. I really wish i belonged to the cavemen times.. what would we need to compete for, besides food and water and maybe a wife?.. haha.. ok.. so.. we're still competing.. well.. i'm still figuring the meaning of my life.. it's complicating.. and at times.. really pathetic.. I don't even know what i want to be when i grow up.. i'm ambitionless.. i'm talentless and plain empty.. I'm really worried.. my studies suck.. and it seems like 'so will my future'..
