I'd like to act cool and say: "YYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!," but I don't at all feel like doing that. I don't want to lie to myself that I am pleased to be leaving school in just one year. I am seriously scared...  What will I do? I just want to stay in school and play guitar and mess about with my friends and continue to try and chat up nice girls. Now I have to fit it all in to one year before my life begins to decompose.  You never realise how good you've got it until you lose it. The trouble is all I can do is get on with it. The weekends away from you all get longer and longer, and my weekends with you get shorter and shorter.  I have a preminition that my life as a guitarist will all go to pot, and I'll just become somekind of washout. I want to die young and free, instead of old and bored. I would want to comit suicide if it all didn't work out well, but the problem is that I couldn't do that to myself. I'd just be watching my life tick away, sitting in my chair. Watching young people enjoying their lives, through a pain of glass. I'll just be sitting there, rotting away.  I've never talked to anyone about Sophie W except to Badge. I really like her, but I can't say anything to her for fear of rejection. I kind of know I'll be rejected as soon as I say anything. She only cares about the other guys like T.J and Zach and so on. She told me herself. She probably just thinks I'm a dufous compared to those guys. I'm so immature and stupid for falling for her of all people. It may seem like I like her for obvious reasons, but that's not true. Anyone who says that is just jealeous. She is a genuinely nice person. I only have one year left though, so I might aswell tell her. You can tell her if you really want, I don't care anymore. I have nothing to hide. When you're telling her though, just think of me and what you are doing to me. What have I done to anyone to deserve that? Just think about that. I am a PERSON with FEELINGS, not just some geek that no-one likes.  I'm just afraid that I will spend the rest of my life regretting what I didn't do for fear of rejection, when I had nothing to lose anyway...
