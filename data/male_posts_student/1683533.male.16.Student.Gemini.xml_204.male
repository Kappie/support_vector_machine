If you guys wanna go to the release party I suggest you get tickets early cause 9miles2go has a pretty big fan base now and Blueprint 76 has a bigger one probably, also the fire marshall reduced the amount of people allowed in the Shelter. If you guys don't go then I still suggest you check out Blueprint 76, I listened to them and they sound good.
