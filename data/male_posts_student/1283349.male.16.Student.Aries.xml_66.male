Maybe one or two. A bookstore would be cool, as would selling newspapers door-to-door. Get some sun, get some walking in, get some fresh air. Not a bad way to make some money.  Anyways, the summer is also looking busy. Driver's Ed., strength and conditioning camp at Jesuit, a bajillion handy-man jobs around both households, and of course, wooing ze ladies and playing ze games. Oh, and my dad is talking about studying for SAT stuff, but he's nuts. Unfortunately, he's nuts -and- controls my tuition at Jesuit.  Ugh, I'm hot and tired and I don't think I can write much more. I got my groove back with Imperian, I'm having a blast with Brian and the crew, and I... am going to take a nap... so... tir...zzzzzz...  Sincerely, Zzzzz...
