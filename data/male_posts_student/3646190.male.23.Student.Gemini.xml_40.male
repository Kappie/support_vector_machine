Words are not able to express what I feel, but it is a tingle at the fingertips, and the rush of thoughts every single day, and a smile racing through the streets that point me in a direction.  I think I know where I am going, but I have given up trying to know the precise destination. As long as my journey does not end in a life of meaninglessness I will find happiness.   I am the sole measure of my life's success and worth and that is the most difficult task ahead- to measure my own life's success on my own judgment.  PS I will be at my organizationâ€™s conference this weekend in Punn Yum, New York so no blogging till Monday. I hope my blog-mates will hold the fort down!!
