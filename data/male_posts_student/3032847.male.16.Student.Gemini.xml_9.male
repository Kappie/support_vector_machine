I've just got back from Carlton- a wee village near here (best known for Carlton Outdoor Centre (camp...), where all the primary school kids go). We had a Tie meal (is that how ya spell Tie)? out of this pub. Proper traditional english pub- hand worked beer pumps, loads of old bottles nd beer mats nd that spread all over, dingey smokey atmosphere and one of them quiet men at the edge of the bar with a moustache- the lot, except the blokes married some Tie lass so they 'ave Tie food on the menue. Dead cheap an' all. I had king prawns and all that- and it was cheaper than a Burger King!  Im gobsmacked. This blogging lark is really easy! In the last two days I've been listed in the blogging brits and euroblogs webrings, and my webstats indicate that yesterday, I got quite a number of visits from  technorati  where this things been listed! I'm not just forcing keywords on anything here *cough* but who would have thought this blog from a British, -town of Hartlepool, ( monkeyhanger / hartlepudlian ) teen would be listed around and shite so fast? All it is is a commentary on my exams, so far! Hmm.. imagine what can be achieved... 'JB Industries buys out Microsoft, owner elected president of the EU' (stops daydreaming)
