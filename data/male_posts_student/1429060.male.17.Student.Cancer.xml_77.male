And fossils aren't real, because they were put there by the Devil to trick us into finding a practical way to interpret this existence. (By the way, the earth isn't round either. It turned flat yesterday. Hey, why not, the earth is only ten years old.)  I am crotchety, grumpy old Mr. Gruff who thinks he has it all worked out. And, yes, I will lash out at a little Christian child. That is, if he comes up to me and tells me I am going to hell.  Cheers. I am simmering down. Someone tell me if this is offensive.
