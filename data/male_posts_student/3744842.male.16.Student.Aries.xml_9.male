Then i went to Home Depot to pick up some lumber for my dad, it was kinda fun, it got me outta the house anyway.  I got home, did some more nothing...........then we had speggitti for dinner, i love italian.  Then after dinner i went and picked up my truck, i finally have something to drive yay!.........and now i'm back home talkin to the best people in the world, favorate time of the day!
