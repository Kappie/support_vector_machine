I just am too tired to come online. In fact, I am very tired today also..even more tired than yesterday. I just wanna blog lor. Ayiah..my Tutorial 4 still haven't do yet...idiot! Must do tomorrow, along with possiblity of Chinese Compo. Shit. AHH! I forgot also got the chinese book review thingy!   Okay whatever la. Yesterday was okay lor. Oh yes. At GP, I defended my views on caning is a torture. Almost everyone don't agree. I don't care. Caning is toturous all the same. Two wrongs don't make a right after all.   Today is even more exciting. Okay. Today is Janet's birthday, so happy birthday to ya! :D  Hmmm. Today was so-and-so. We have to do the idiotic canal run lor! I was, once again, slow. I have to do 480 jumping jacks. Idiot la. I felt so tired, run-down and worn out. I was actually 'shaking' on the bus...and I never shook so hard since witnessing my Godfather's cremation. I don't think anyone noticed...(that crap WQ...I was so tired le and he still continus making fun of me. Fuck him la)..Oh my god...I feel so tired! If I have to do this again and again, I rather cripple my leg and not run again, since running only bring me so much torture. Why can't the idiot teachers understand that some people just CAN'T run? What? If they can run, fine. Good for them. Some just can't. There's no use punishing us lor. So what if I do 480 jumping jacks? It's not gonna improve my score. I will deliberately fail NAPTA test! Okay..not sit-and-reach, because I can really stretch and I want to do well in that. It's the only thing I can pass anyway.   Okay. After a whole deal of rambling on and on, I will describe Janet's birthday. We brought her a bag for her brithday. HaHa. We kinda ignored her in the morning, because we want to give her a surprise in the evening ma. Okay. In the evening, we led Janet to Causeway Ploint, where MeiYing and ThongZhen 'ambushed' her with a cake. HaHa! We all celebrated for her. HaHa! Okay. I kinda had fun, despite the tiredness. :)  Tomorrow in PJ, we have a "smart-casual day", where we can wear our home clothes. HaHa. I am wearing the zipper shirt with my black (which is turning greyer and greyer..ayioh!) pants. HaHa! Even cats are wearing home clothes tomorrow.   Okay. I realize that this is very late. Okay. I end the blog le. See ya next time! Night blog!
