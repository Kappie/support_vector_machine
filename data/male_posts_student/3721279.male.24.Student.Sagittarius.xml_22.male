Either that, or Doom 3 is really just a game full of a bunch of white screens, box-shaped cursors, and blue buttons with a really clever marketing scheme. Bitches. Now I have to buy a new computer.  I suppose it's all well and good, because the last thing I need to be doing right now is getting into a new computer game. I've really grown nearly completely out of interest with all video games. Maybe it's my job, and the constant bombardment and harrassment by pseudo-human customers, continually giving me an example of what I might become if I did nothing else. I remember (not so fondly) spending summers of my youth inside the sunroom, trying desperately to defeat the Umbrella Corporation, or laying the smack down on M. Bison unscathed. Now it seems that I have to play multiplayer games with my friends to extract even the slightest bit of entertainment, but even that is now waning. I can't recall the last time I got excited to play Neverwinter. Sorry Rykjavik, but Keldar needs to take a rest in Imladris for a spell.  Running is still getting shorter, and easier, even though it still sucks right about halfway through our track. I'm actually feeling much healthier, though I need to stop allowing other people to convince me to go out and eat all the time, (a) because it wastes money, and (b) because I just spent like $65 at the grocery store on healthy food, and it's sitting in my fridge slowly perishing. Curse you, Peer Pressure!  I've decided that we need to have another party at the house soon. For once, it seems like my roommates and I have a social group that isn't full of some kind of stupid drama, and I think this will be the first party in the last three years or so when I didn't feel as though I had to impress any girls, or hover near a significant other. I love hosting a get-together, and I hope we have enough time to prepare and invite before the school bell starts dinging again.  This Saturday marks the second annual Golf/Picnic/Pool Party outing of my father's adult Sunday School class since his death last summer. They decided to rename it "The Jim Ehrhart Memorial Golf Tournament" or something like that. I'm looking forward to it and dreading it all at the same time. It's good to see old friends of the family, even if I don't attend their church or necessarily believe in the same things they do. What I fear is that I'm going to be bombarded with the "So how are you coping?" questions, and I get to pretend I know how to answer them. It's probably a needless worry, because I think most of the people there are a little smarter than that, but the truth is, I still don't know how to deal with my father's death, and as far as I can tell I never really will. I don't think there's a tried and true technique for coping with loss, and to be honest, it's been the furthest thing from my mind for the last couple of weeks. Hmm. At least I can look forward to the rockin' taco salad.  I keep putting off clothing shopping. I want to go, I really do. And it's not even a "I'm fat, I can't buy clothing" thing. It's a money thing. Now my roommates would say, "Dave, use your credit card. Spend thousands of dollars. In fact, get more credit cards, and only pay off your minimums and go into debt." The fact is, I'm terrified of money. I have one credit card which I use pretty regularly, but I only use it to slightly supplement my typical spending, and I always pay it off completely. I can't explain it, but I fear not having enough money, and ending up broke and starving. Is that a bad fear? The truth is, I'll probably go shopping next week, once I've received my pay check to rule all other previous pay checks this Friday.  I'm certainly not the most thrifty guy you'll ever meet, but I guess I just want to be safe. Balls.  I boarded and sleeved an entire box of comics last night, and I have two more to go. What's worse is that I should probably do the same for all the comics I no longer want to keep, for when it comes time to start up "The Amazing Robb  Dave Ebay Store of Supreme Awesomeness" which neither of us is doing anything about. And boy howdy, do I have a lot of old DD books to get rid of too. Anyone want the complete set of core books for 3rd Edition, plus most of the supplemental books too? Come on, I even have the Psionics Book!  Now you   know   you want them! (rubbing my hands together with a wicked scheming grin)  Okay, it is officially 3:10 in the afternoon, and I haven't had a shower yet. I'm going to go bathe, so if anyone wants to stop by and assist, that'd be hot. We'll even film it, and sell it on the net. And we can...(pause)...wait, sorry, I let one of my porno fantasies slip in there. Dammit.
