Since they are unsure when Cheatday really is, they go by the birthday on his fake ID, which states that he is a Scandinavian Cole Miner.  He starts off by singing, and then they play games, and then Strong Bad lets Cheat answer some of his emails, each one saying, "Yeah Man, I'll gnaw your head off."  This one isn't the best Strong Bad Emails that I have looked at.  There are some much better.  But, oh well, it's good enough.
