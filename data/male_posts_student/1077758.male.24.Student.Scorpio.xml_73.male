No, you sick freak.) chills, aches in my joints/general soreness, and running a fever of 101.  This morning, add a headache to that, take away the hot flashes chills and aching, and keep the temperature at the same level, and that's where I'm at.  So I'm going to go upstairs and watch TV with my mom all friggin' day.  Oh well.
