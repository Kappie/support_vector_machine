After work I took Cindy and her deceased rat to the vet on Park Ave. Unfortunately, the vet closed at 5, so we were a bit out of luck. Her rat is starting to give off an odor, poor little thing, so she wants to get it cremated soon.  Linda, Michele, Cindy and I went to Dinosaur BBQ around 6. We arrived and to our wonderful surprise, we were seated right away. However, there was an hour wait, so we were very lucky to have surpassed it. We all had chicken and a couple of them had ribs too. I had a sandwhich with their macaroni and cheese and 'marshed' potatoes as Cindy put it. :) They were fantastic.  I dropped Cindy off at her dorm and came back and spent a quiet night with the cat watching Stargate on SciFi. Unfortunately, I kept falling asleep during the show so I missed a couple important scenes. Luckily, they repeat the same 2 episodes at the 10 and 11:00 hour, so I set the tape and went to bed.  I woke up this morning at 9:30. I think I had almost 11 hours of sleep. Who needs that much sleep? I got ready and went on a couple errands. First I headed off to the post office to mail a DVD back to Netflix (2 week free trial), I dropped by Staples and bought 25 blank DVDs for $20 and then headed to ESL, my bank, to cancel that new credit card I got through them. It turns out its a little different than they first described to me. And I don't need a credit card for a couple perks when I already have a credit card at 7.9%. After waiting 30 minutes, the lady looked at me weird when I asked to cancel it. "Um.. I've never actually had to cancel one of these..." Heh. Let me be the first lady.  Then I headed to Target to use my new gift card I got from Uno. (Thanks sooo much Cindy!) Target isn't my favorite store in the whole world (no offense to Laura or Uno who love the store), first because prices are higher than Walmart and second because their selection seems to be limited. So I searched the store front to back for their nice garbage cans (Cindy indicated I should get one since I need a nice one). Well, I found their plastic ones.. and they sucked. So I kept looking. On the other side of the store, like 15 aisles away, I found the metal garbage cans, and they were nice. They were also $100 or more each. Whooo! Yeah right.  So I looked through every section of the store for other possible things to buy with my gift card. Nope. How about... nope. Do they have... nope! Damnit! They don't have anything I want. So I looked some more, got really tired of looking and headed to Walmart to return an item there. They easily took that item back, but they refused to give me my money back for an item they double charged me for. They said I'd have to go back to Irondeqoit to return it. Ugh. I need to spend $2 in gas to get $1.99 refunded. Yeah right.  So I left Walmart and got gas and headed back home. I ate lunch and watched the taped Stargate from last night. Unfortunately, I kept falling asleep again.. so I had to keep rewinding. Sheesh, Luke. What is it with you and falling asleep? I went to the 2:30 showing of Chronicles of Riddick, which was a good movie. I didn't like how fast the imagry moved on screen. It stinks when you can't see what they're showing you. But I liked it, and saw a lot of the same qualities its prequel had.  After the movie I went back to Target to try and find something to buy. Believe it or not, I spent 2 hours there trying to find something. I finally decided I would buy items that I truly need rather than something 'gift like.' So I bought 2 new pillows, super-odor-killing kitty litter, febreez, a new DVD, blank DVD labels and some toilet paper. Over all, a great birthday present from Uno! Thanks Uno! :-) :-) :-)  So now I'm sitting in my apartment waiting for something to do. Tomorrow evening I'm heading to my grandmothers with Laura and Cindy for my birthday party, but until then I'm probably just going to do some serious cleaning around the apartment. Maybe I'll watch a couple of the DVDs I've reclaimed.
