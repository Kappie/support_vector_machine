Because of the weight, I actually had a 4.048 for term six, which really helped drag my cumulative GPA out of the gutter(Yes, I consider a 3.3 to be the gutter.  I can do better).  It will make my parents very happy, which should in turn make me very happy.  It's nice to be back on track. Is that a rocket you've got hidden there?  No, it's my cookie.
