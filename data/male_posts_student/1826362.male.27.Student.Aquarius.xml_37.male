I think I'm going to like it, because 1. the first two weeks reading assignments are all philosophers: kant, foucoult (I think i've terribly mangled the spelling) and somebody else.  I like philosophy.  I'm jazzed at the prospect of learning about romantic poetry by reading influential philosophy. The prof has said that the only real way to study something like romanticism is by studying the ideas that those folks were trying to work with, hence the philosophy and the assignment of an Austen novel in a poetry class.  2. the prof is delightfully nutty.  He seems great, has a sense of humor, and has told us that he is not a touchy feely kind of teacher, meaning that he will not tell us what we just said is interesting if it is in fact stupid.  He has encouraged us to speak up in class with the warning that he will probably trash what we say, but that we should fight back, and that we won't learn much by sitting back and smiling politely while someone else says something we dissagree with.  He made it sound like every week will be an intellectual battle.  He actually kind of reminded me of a football coach a little bit.
