Even if you are not sharing copyrighted files your probably still paranoid about being sued.  There was one incident of a university professor sharing a mp3 of his class lesson and it just happened to have the same matching name of a music artist.  So the one thing you can do to protect your identity on the internet is by tunneling through an anonymous proxy.  There are many free ones available on the net you can search google for free proxies.  The proxy speeds will vary and may not be as fast as your internet connection but your IP address wont be shown to anyone except the people running the proxy.  Another thing to do is [ if you can ] is to use a wireless access point.  There are many un-encrypted access point around.  There might even be one next door. ;-)  Hey, if the wireless signal is not encrypted and it is on my property  why  can't I use it.  Now if it's encrypted don't try and hack it because they obviously do not want you on their wireless network; not to mention it would be illegal.  As long as it is un-encrypted, why not use it?  Your internet IP address will not be shown, only theirs would shown.  Also be sure to run a software firewall on your end to protect yourself from their LAN.  You may need a "cantenna" or some other industrial WI-FI antenna and a "pig tail" to fit your wireless card's needs.  Take a look at  urlLink Fleeman Anderson  Bird Corp   for antennas and "pig tails"  they also have the necessary equipment so you can make your own "cantennas".  [Try searching for this one ;-) ]  If I get enough feedback about this then I will post some more.
