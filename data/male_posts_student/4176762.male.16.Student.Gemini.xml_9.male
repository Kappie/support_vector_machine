I refresh about eighty million times, but to no avail the site is down.  Today has been one of the weirdest days of the summer.  I am addicting to the forum and I couldn't believe that I wasn't on it. Some how I've managed. Dinner last night was fun.  Me, my sister, my mom, Master Yasay and his two daughters all went to eat at Houston's.  My brother didn't make it.  Holy crap did he get his ass chewed by mom. The rest of the night was uneventful, I played some COD and modded on the forum.  Today was interesting alright.  After giving up on Semisomnus.com, I donned my Taekwondo pants, grabbed a t-shirt and went to go work out in the garage.  After about 45min of punching bags and such I get a call from Taylor.  It seems him and Mikey are at Border's, I tell them to pick up Initial D 13 then come over to my house so we can duel.  No not sword fighting, they are not martial artists.  We played Yu-Gi-Oh.  Thats right a bunch of high school seniors played Yu-Gi-Oh.  I don't see the big deal, Yugi is in 10th grade after all. Great, now you're all thinking, "God, Blackdog is such a dork". Oh, well.  After they left my Tanchan went to football practice, he's the manager, and Leethar informed me he bought the tix for AvP. Yay!! Tomorrow I have to go to school and take a laptop training for my school IBM, ewww! Im sure you all are tired of reading my long ass posts by now, but I promise when school starts these post will be interesting. Until next time (tomorrow).
