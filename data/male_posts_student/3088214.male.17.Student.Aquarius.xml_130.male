History, unlike English, is a subject with definitive answers... it's an engine that needs all its parts to run correctly, and this morning I was purring like a ferrari on steroids!  Most of my answers I knew, atleast 60 of them I was able to narrow it down to two, and there were only three I wasn't able to answer at all!  I was soooo pleased, and the essays?  Right up my alley.  Don't take this the wrong way, I don't WANT to gloat, but I feel like I'm OBLIGATED to I feel so good about myself right now.  I'm sure everyone else did good too, because if you payed attention in class the last couple weeks, and reviewed a little bit then you had the tools for a 4 or 5.  If you want to get pissed at me for this self-glorifying post, you have that right... but make me feel good and praise me for my temporary genious!  Love, Rob
