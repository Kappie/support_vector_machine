I end up staying up Ã¼ber-late so that I can do stuff, and then being knackered and deaded the next day. I fell asleep / passed out in graphics today, which would have been quite embarrassing, had anyone noticed before I came round. They didn't, obviously. I'm now on my 6th can of Coke today, I'm hoping the caffeine and sugar will be enough to keep me going 'till midnight, then I'll lie in the dark with my eyes shut and listen to my nice new album by the Walkmen, on my Walkman. IRONEH!!!  I would comment on Euro "Z00"-thousand and four (Worst. Pun. Ever.), but I dont't think I can contribute anything extra, other than that I thought the England performance was class, bar the two stupid mistakes.  So, buy.  urlLink This album.  L.O.L., see what I did there?  So, bye.
