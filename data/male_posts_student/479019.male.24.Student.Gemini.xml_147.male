It's kind of annoying since I'll have gone to that shop 4 days in row. Work was whatever. I wasn't very motivated today. It's hard to stay motivated when you know you aren't going to be with the company much longer. I did some reading for grad school tonight too. It's a short essay by R.H. Hilton on the medieval economy. It seems most of the stuff I'm reading for 601 is on the medieval economy and the transition from feudalism to capitalism. It's mainly stuff on historiography and economics. It's not really what I expected to be reading for a graduate degree in sociology, but it's cool stuff. I love the fact that my sociology department is so inter- or as Prof. Lee put it, pan-disciplinary. I'm just hoping that I can avoid statistics.  Songs that have been in rotation recently have been the Sahara Hotnights' "On Top of Your World," Big Country's "In A Big Country," Dexy's Midnight Runners' "Come Eileen," and the Ataris' "1-15-96."  The days have seem really long lately.  **
