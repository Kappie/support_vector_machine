Everyday is beat up Jeff Garza day. hahaha just kidding jeff, we  (u better spike your hair!)  Disciple Now is this weekend at FBC Coppell, im so excited i cant wait! nothin like a whole weekend devoted to God while spending it with your closest Christian friends. yay for God!  school stinks, its SO boring now. only 30 more weeks left.....  i cant wait til Ross V comes back, he comes back i think not this weekend but next...look for him in his spiffy uniform!!  i miss matteo too  bibi you still rock my world...   over the past couple of weeks I have learned a good deal about the friendships i have with other people. I have realized the friendships i have made in middle school have been the best than ones made before or after. Also the ones i have made in band, you people rock and I am forever grateful on how you always seem to be there for me whether i need support at a tryout or a shoulder to lean on when im frustrated. Mostly to the people who always are there to give me a hug (Melissa, Ross, Kevin, Kyle, Kyle, Mooney) you guys make everything so worth while. And to my other friends, you guys mean just as much, without you I don't know what i would do with myself. Thanks.  As for the friends I have lost, I do not regret ever being your friend, It was great times. God just is showing me a different direction and I trust him with all my heart. Maybe our friendship will grow again if God chooses to cross our paths once again.   and a SPECIAL happy birthday to my budday Brian. You rock my world.  alright kids, thats all for now  when the world around you crumbles....he will be strong  *rock on and dont forget your safety goggles*
