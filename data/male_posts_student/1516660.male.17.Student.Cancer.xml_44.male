But when we realised that the Sops started too soft and the audience can't hear. our confidence level fell. From not-so-weak to  pathetic ! I wonder why the audience even clapped that loud. Sheez.   Second performance:  Some improvements there. We are not soft this time. I think the audience can hear, given the loud appluase. But the for the Ba Jun Zhan arh!!! The timing was terribly wrong! There is one part where Alto 2 and Alto 1s were supposed to go: ting-di li. No pause between ting and the ti li. But we sang until there was about one to two notes pause between the two sounds. And the Alto 2s' voices were weak. We were getting tired and fustrated. More improvments can be done at tomorrow performance (only to two classes....mine and another class)!!!  Yeah.....that's about all.   I go so much angst to express.
