Went to Quizno's, had clam chowder, it wasgood at first, but not so much later.  Walk aroundBed Bath and Beyond.  Went home.  Then practice driving with my dad, for almost 2 hours to moorpark and back too moorpark and back. then the local and back the local and back. then stop at his friends house and waited for an hour in the car infront of some one house.  I had to go to the bathroom also so i was just holding it in for an hour. :( They were infront of their house thinking i was some rapist waiting for someone or something in that area.  Just sat there and listen to music and look up in the sky.  Finally went home and ate another bowl of spaghetti.  and now going online.
