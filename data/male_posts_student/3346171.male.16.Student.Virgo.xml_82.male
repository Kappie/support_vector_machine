Is obvious that everybody realized that  "the ones"  ( ones= the lucky ones on Earth) have the  best jobs and, the best cars and cribs, they always luck good on pics and sure: hot stuff only atracts hot stuff!  I don't like when someone says "Ya're ok!", it means that i ain't a lucky one, though i'm not trash! It's kinda good, but we want more, we want to be on top! The thing is:  where is the top?! Who to get there?!  I don't know. If someone does, please give me a call!    Bulshit! I don'tcare for that stuff that much. I guess that a muscle chest and a straight hair, without a brain in shape is like... nothing! I like working my brain out, and i admite that i work out ( but for motives that i have told before), and if my dad doesn't pay the italian course, ( i also have to admit)  i'll not stop working out! I got used to it!  Some friends say that i got a larger arm and my chest has grown, I just love it! I'm so embarassed, i was a defensor of the "iteligence no matter what".    The society demands you to have the society's body (  which is a : slim body, white teeth, nails done and a cinnamon tan ), and i must confess that i want to be part of the society!    Don't you?!
