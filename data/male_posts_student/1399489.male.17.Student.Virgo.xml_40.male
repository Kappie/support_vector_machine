This week has been pretty good i guess.. i almost died at football at monday, tues was a little better and today was really good (probally b/c i finally got to play my fav position, middle linebacker).  School isnt hard at all at least so far.  its just it takes up more time that last year .. maybe b/c i do all my homework lol.  Tonight was the act, sat, psat prep thing once again!  i picked up erin on my way there and then dropped her off again (sry katie i stole her from u for the night hahaha).  it was alright i was gettin really ADD though.  i got sooo bored probally b/c we were learning about fractions whooo! lol but at least i had some ppl to talk to.  I got to leave football early for it too its all good.  after that i was gonna go to get jessica a present b/c her b day is tomorrow but everything was closed so i guess i'll give her a belated gift.  hope she doesnt mind.  I have a feeling tomorrow will be a really good day and the rest of this week.  Tomorrow is special teams day at football and then after football me and bryndan and hopefully ben (he got in trouble but i dont know how much yet i havent heard the word) are gonna head over to swensons for jessicas party.  free icecream! yummm.  ok well im gonna head out and get a good night of sleep .. i need one ttyl!  hope everyone is havin a good school year so far! laturz!  P.S. - sry if i didnt call u tonight (or latley) and i usually do.  i am and have been really tired and overworked.  but i still love u  :-)  :~)
