I generally watch on Sun. nights, but a friend told me that it airs live 7am on Wed. mornings.  And I might just have to get up to watch it.  This week was so HOTT (with two t's).  Tony Blair ripped the Conservatives a new one.  Unfortunately it was cut off after Blair basically called the opposition leader a coward.  Now I can't find transcripts nor video.
