Dan Roman died of cancer, and I don't think he was probably more than 40 years old (not sure).  I didn't know Dan as well as I would have liked, but we spent my very first week in Atlanta together.  He was down helping with some facility related issues in the move from the old lab to the new facility in Kennesaw.  I got to know him enough to know that he was a good man, and I'm sad to hear of his passing.    It illustrates that we never know how much time we have.  Get busy living, while you still can.
