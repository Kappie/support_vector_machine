For some of you who do not know what Colour Night is, it's a evening where academic, athletic, and other awards are given to students of the Shaunavon High School.  As far as friends go:   Chris : Top Male Jr. Track Athlete as he competed in 100m at the provincial track meet on June 4th, in Saskatoon.    Kent : Computer Honourable Mention for grade 10.  (Congratulations, young apprentice!  May the force be with you!)     Gayle, Me, Laura,  Sarah : Honour Role  (80% average or better)  and Major Athletic Awards.  Laura : Social Studies Honourable Mention, English Honourable Mention, Science Honourable Mention, Math Honourable Mention, French Honourable Mention, Physical Education Honourable Mention, Work Ethic Honourable Mention, Art Honourable Mention, the Proficiency Award, and 2nd Highest Average in grade 9.     (Takes a deep breath)  Congratulations to all my friends.  I am glad that I am friends with a group that can apply themselves and be successful in many diverse ways.  You make me proud.    As for myself... I don't like to boast and I try to avoid it, but I will share mine with you, cause I mean, this is a Blog about ME! ;) I received the History Award, Computer Science Award, and Good Work Ethic Award.  I am glad I won the History Award because, not only was my mark good, but I actually enjoy the topic.  I find myself a history 'buff'.  I am interested in World War I, but even more so, World War II.  Mr. Smith knew that I watched and owned many WWII movies.  He was also surprised to know that sometimes I'd go onto a site, that he had recommended for me for any historical essays, and just read up on things for my own personal interest and good.  The Computer Science Award, was also appreciated.  I had the knowledge going into the class and the highest average throughout the semester.  Everyone says I won because I work at Legacy Computers.  It is true that I've learned alot at Legacy, but what I have learned there from Rob and Evan was not taken in the class.  I knew alot of the topic before I worked there.  The Work Ethic was also earned in my biast opinion.  I calculated that I had missed 5½ weeks of school.  I got very sick in the first semester with mononucleosis and viral meningitis.  I was in the hospital for one week  (Missed my f*cking Birthday!)  and missed 2½ weeks sitting at home.  The other 2 weeks I missed were for the recovery of my knee surgery that I spent at home hopping around on one leg between the toilet, fridge, TV, and computer.  I also missed days here and there for doctor appointments, holidays, track meet, etc.  So to keep a 90% average after all of that is a accomplishment in itself.  I believe my cocky rant is done.    The night was good and I feel it's nice to see people awarded for the effort they put in year round.  Makes one feel good inside.   Now, if I missed your name and the awards that you have won in the first paragraph, let me know and I will edit the post.   (If I consider you a friend of course...)
