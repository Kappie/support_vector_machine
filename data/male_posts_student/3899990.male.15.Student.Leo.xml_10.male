Then, we went to have Dim Sum at this Chinese restaurant located in Arcadia, CA and the food was excellent. Then, we went to the Santa Anita mall and found some really great deals. For an example, I went to Macy's and got a pair of cargo shorts for only $9.00 and the original price was $35.00. There are some really great competitive deals here compare to what we have in AZ.  We spent about 3 hours at the mall and only walked out with 2 items total. We then went back to the hotel and rested for a while. Once it hit six, it was time to get ready and go to dinner. Again, we went to a Chinese restaurant and the best part was the food was both good and cheap. So far, you can't compare the food here to Arizona. We have the crappiest Chinese food there! That's about it for today.   Tomorrow's Plans:  Going to Beverly Hills (Rodeo Drive) and Hollywood. It'll be a full day adventure and of course, I am going to bring my digital camera and will take some pictures. I'll give ya the details tomorrow night!
