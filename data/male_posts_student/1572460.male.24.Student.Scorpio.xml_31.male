My only concern is about the rounded templates being too narrow; they don't take up the whole horizontal space of the browser window. The narrow width makes my posts look way too much longer than they are in reality (*grin*). Also, for now, I would prefer to stick with my backBlog comments; not too impressed with Blogger's comments feature, it loads up a separate page to post and view.
