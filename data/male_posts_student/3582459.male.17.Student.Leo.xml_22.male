Perhaps it's because I'm beyond the stage when it is easy (I am loath to use the term easy, but bear with me) to learn and grow--I've read pretty much the whole Bible and have what I hope is a fairly good foundation of true faith and beliefs that come with. Also, I've come to know many people at church as pretty close friends. In short, I've reached the stage where it's possible to go to organized worship with socialising instead of learning and growing in mind.     Now, friendships and community are tremendously important, but they should not be the driving force behind a desire to go to service c.; rather, they should be an outcome of the body of Christ meeting together with the intention of learning and growing together.     From now on I will pray every day that God will move in me a desire to learn and grow more, which I sort of have but also sort have been lacking as of late, and specifically that God will move in me to treat organized worship not as a social club but focus on it with a real mind for learning and growth.
