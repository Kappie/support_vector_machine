I don't feel any sadness for the room in which I spent the last 12 years of my life - not only because my new one is bigger - but also because we did not move away. I'm now certain that nostalgia depends not only on time's gradual passing, but also on the sudden reality of a translocation. I'm full of shit.  Can't wait to get settled in!
