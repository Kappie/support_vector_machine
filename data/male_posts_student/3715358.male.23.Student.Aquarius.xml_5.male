I've been doing a lot of soul searching lately and it seems i have come to the conclusion that i am most like the character Meatwad off of the show Aqua Teens Hunger Force (#1 in the hood G). This soul searching of course involved only 2 online quizzes, man am I deep! Anyway enough of this nonsense, Here I sit alone on a Saturday night because i have decided that i really wouldn't care if i never went to a bar again in my life. Of course this might reduce my chance of interaction with the human race but hey would anyone really miss me that much :) Aight thought i would just throw this blogger out there for you all hope you all enjoy it immensly! To end this blog i would like to throw some Meatwad quotes out there for you all....BLING!  "I require a popsicle every 15 min you obviously did not read my memo!"  "Everybody hates me because they die or get hurt. "  "Alright spaghetti! Now that's italian!"  "This noodles black..... and its hooked up to the tv set."
