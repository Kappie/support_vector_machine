After quite a while came the time for the cake, they turned down the lights, Pat asked, "Why are they turning the lights down?" I was tempted to say, "So the ugly girls have a chance to dance," but I figured I probably shouldn't. They weren't any ugly girls there anyway; it's bad enough to call an ugly girl ugly, but to call a pretty girl ugly...  While I was standing outside, George, the brother of Margie (the birthday girl) came outside and said, "I hate it when that happens!" I said, "What?" He said, "I got a burrito in my pants." I looked at his knees and there was a lump and a wet spot from the sour cream and salsa. What's funny is that he said it as if it's happened before.  At the house they had some pictures of Bush dressed up as a fighter pilot with some real pilots, and the first thing Charlie notices is that they're all wearing cups. I think wearing cups is a perfectly reasonable thing-- what, with all the triple a's and the missiles flying at you all the time, you need some protection*. You don't want a SAM, or God forbid, a SCUD (just in case you accidentally hit one on the way) in that particular part. Plus, according to movies, the joystick is right in that special spot; if you slam on the brakes really quickly, that would hurt.   *"Ma'am, you husband was shot down, this is all we recovered of him."
