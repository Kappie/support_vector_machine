I opened it up and just started to read, by chance I opened the book to the chapter on Mr. Schlosser's trip to a Slaughter-House-- The only way I can describe it is that it was shocking, disturbing, and more than enough to repulse me from eating meat for the rest of my days.  So I am a vegetarian, sort-of... I've decided I'm still going to eat fish occasionally- I don't think I could give up sushi.  Now I don't think it is hypocritical, I am a "vegetarian" because I don't agree with the practices of the meat industry, the fishing industry isn't great but they still haven't come up with a way to completely torture the lives of fish.  I think this is a step in the right direction.
