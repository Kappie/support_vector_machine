What you are about to read may seem like a weird joke, but I assure you it is an accurate telling of events along with the most plausible theorys.  At some point before 5:45 PST, on Friday, April 10th 2003, I, Erik "Bun-Bun", and Tristan Mueller-Vollmer crossed over into another dimension. To the best of our knowledge we are still inside this dimension, making us outsiders in your world. As a result of us crossing many things happened. I will try to be as detailed as necessary, but I will change names to protect these people's identities. In addition, the dimensions will be referred to as Alpha and Omega, being my home dimension and the one I am currently in respectively. If you are reading this, consider yourself an Omegan.   List of discovered phenomena caused by dimension hop   a) Many friends and acquatinces of ours partially appeared to make the hop with us. In one case, a man who we will refer to as Bonathan's Alpha self mentally merged with his Omega self, giving him the memories of both people, and causing him to develop psychic powers.  b) Another friend, who we shall call Bizzy, had a similar thing occur to her. However, when her mental self crossed over it discovered a very severe obstacle. Bizzy Bood died in this dimension when she was very young, meaning that Alpha Bizzy's "spirit" had no body to migrate to. This caused her existence to be threatened. While she can remain in the spirit form indefinately with no immediately perceivable danger, her ability to interact with the world is gone. Luckily, at the same moment this occured, I ask you to recall that Bonathan was developing psychic powers. Having them develop fully in such a short time caused them to activate automatically and go out of control. Bizzy's spirit seemed to find that, and use the powers to create a physical body for herself. After this, Bonathan's psychic powers are keeping Bizzy in a physical form, though when he gets distracted(such as browsing for CDs), or goes to sleep, Bizzy returns to her spiritual form, at least until morning(to be fair, with Bonathan's sleep cycle, it tends to be the afternoon).  More will probably surface, and I might be forgetting something as well. But for now...   Evidence for Dimension Hopping   At this point, some of you may be thinking I'm insane.  So if you would allow me, I would like to present the evidence that we used to originally establish that a dimensional shift had occured.  a) Tristan was working at his place of employment (the library), when he heard the message that the Library would be closing in 15 minutes. This would be acceptable if it hadn't been closing an hour early.  b) Tristan's passenger side door opens from the outside. This door had previously not worked for around 63 years.  c) Tristan's car was also shiny and clean, a state which he claims was not put that way by him. Indeed, he says the car was washed "months ago".  d) Blaudia Braven's church was emanating evil waves. Both Tristan and I felt something was different about the church, but could not locate any physical difference. Ms. Bravens claims that the difference is that bushes were removed, something done months ago. Clearly she is part of the Satanist movement inside the "Brace Butheran Burch".  e) Upon pulling up at Bonathan's house, he was already outside walking towards us. Clearly, he had become psychic. He also was very confused, clearly due to the memory gain he had just recently experienced.    Potential Theories   By now I hope I have convinced you that Tristan and I are not of this world, and I hope you are now wondering exactly how we crossed over. Unfortunately, we have little clues to tell us. I have developed several theories for why we are here.  a) Someone called us over. Why this person would want to summon two people from another dimension is a mystery, not to mention how this person did it.  b) The Omega Bizzy Bood didn't die a long time ago. Similar to a), she sacrificed herself in a bizarre ritual to summon us over. Why she would have done this, I know not.  c) We stepped on a physical spot that transported us through space. Odd, and why would people have not figured it out. Unlikely.  d) Accelerating to a certain speed in a moving vehicle caused us to switch over. Possibly caused by playing "Double the Speed-Limit" with Tristan. See Back to the Future for an idea.   I will post more later. As for now, I must attend my Omega classes.
