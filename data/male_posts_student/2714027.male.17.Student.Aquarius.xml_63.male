The maths teacher wants us to finish off a mock paper  overnight !   Serious Sam: Next Encounter  is catastrophically abysmal.  Exams are coming up soon. Ahh!   The good news:  I met up with my friend who took away that girl at the party and we chatted about it during a free period. He said that she told him that she felt guilty leaving me after speaking with me for so long. He knows I still like her and he's okay with that. He also said that I was "welcome to have her if she said no". I'm not sure in what circumstances, but now I'm content.  I'm doing really well with my driving and I'm confident that I'll pass my test on June 5th.  The new Blogger.com is very, very nice with lots of cool features and sexy graphics. GameFAQs should take note; this is how to redesign a website well!  It's sunny again, which means work is far more enjoyable than usual.
