I am, well DEAD tired, sorta over did it at the end of the day i guess, running about, holding children, ugah, pain. Need advil... well not really since I would rather be in pain then take that stuff, but meh. Today I also, well  did nothing but work and watch an hour of TV....  grrr, another boreing day in the day of the life of. Haha. Well tomorrow, I go fencing after work, YEAH! Hmm, I guess I should not post on this EVERY day, its pretty lame when I do, meh.   Note: from now on post only about things which are remotely interesting.
