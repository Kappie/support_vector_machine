Why does all the crap in the world happening to me?!" I WISH FOR A BETTER LIFE!!!!   i wish my parents are well-off enough to lead a comfortable lives. because...  they truly deserve more than what they are getting now. they do not have to slog so much for a living and worried about our school fees and daily expenses. i do not have to worry about my uni fees. we can buy whatever we want. we can eat whatever we want. i do not have to worry about my rent. i can be more generous towards my frens and relatives.  the feeling of having just this much in yr pocket...is certainly demoralising. I am not sure how am i going to get through this period. I am reaching a point where a 'state of emergency' is gonna declared. I feel so lost and helpless... there's so much i wish that things would happen and some things wouldn't happen. It's so fucking shitty that i am now in a state where i am. I really dun know how or what to do anymore. I feel lost and helpless. I desperately in need of a hug. I need a listening ear. i am disillusioned. i am cynical and I feel like crying too. It doesn't make things any better now that my wrist is aggravated and it's hurting even more. how many more setbacks awaits me? Why is my life seems to be spiralling downwards while my gf's life seems to be striving in the opposite directions? i am happy for her yet the same time, i am feeling sad for myself. What can i do to rectify the situation?  How m i going to survive? i really don't know. I am not sure if i am on the correct path anymore. I dun feel like going to work but life has to go on right? no matter how miserable it becomes. Time waits for no one.. i am almost on the verge of throwing the towel. This is just too much for me to take it. who can i turn to? who can i speak to? will anyone transform my life those of a fairy tale with a happy ending? CAN SOMEONE SAVE ME BEFORE I LOSE MYSELF............................................. i am slipping away. i want the bests for my family yet i can seem to get it. WHY IS SO DAMN BLOODY DIFFICULT!!?!!!! FUCK!!! FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  FUCKKKKKKKKK ITT... i am extremely frustrated, mad, depressed, emotionally unstable at this fucking moment. It's driving me fucking nuts.   Some ppl have it all and they are taking it for granted while others, they are desperately seeking for a little bit more and how they got is shite. This is a load of crap. THe rich gets richer while the poor gets poorer. This is just so fucked up.
