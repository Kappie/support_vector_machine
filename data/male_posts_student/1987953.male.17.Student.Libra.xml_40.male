Now the reason I asked the question about gays: I am doing an article for Journalism class about Maryland wanting to allow gay marriages and I wanted to know how people felt. Colin, can I quote you? You have a common opinion among Christians and I agree with you.... so i want to quote you. Can I do so?   I even interviewed a known gay in my school for it. He has totally opposite views from Colin.   Yesterday during English, first period, we had a freewriting assignment. I just wrote stupid stuff about people in my class, for instance, "My bald monkey dances wildly down the corridors of Greg's soul." (Greg Colburn is a fellow Christian, goes to Mountain Christian not too far from Edgewood, also the church my English teacher Mr. Bancells goes to.) I wrote something about Justin, a friend in that class, and then I thought it was funny so I wrote it really big and handed it to him. It says, " Justin steals melons in order to feed lab rats that built an advanced civilization up Mr. Fisher's left nostril!!!" Today he showed it to Greg and Sarah McMillen (also a Mountain Christian goer), and they thought it was so funny they showed it to Mr. Bancells, and he thought it was so funny he put it on his bulletin board.  So now my weirdest writing is exposed for the world to see.  Anyway, blog ya later!  In Christ, Mike
