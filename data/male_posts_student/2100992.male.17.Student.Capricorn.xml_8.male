Well its been a while since the last post so im gunna give us all a little update about whats been goin down, right here in china town ... or stoney creek whichever name you prefer to call our city.  Philadelphia is dominant? ... pft think again! ... Game 2 was a bunch of bullshit that I wont get into but the Leafs should have tied it up, and we were all over them. Game 3 ... can somebody say the return of WADE BELAK! Its about time Pat Quinn put the big Irish lad back into the line up, and i'd say he delivered. For the first time in this series somebody other then Gary Roberts was laying big hits on Keith "the fag" Primeau. And the Leafs got the big win to make the series 2-1 for the fuckers ... Game 4 friday night ... the rumour is Joe Newy and Owen Nolan will be back in the line up, and boy oh boy are my fingers crosses!  WWE Smackdown! live at the Air Canada Center ... my friend Daryl is hopefully going to pick up tickets Saturday morning and i'll be heading down to Toronto on June 1st for the show. WOO GO WRESTLING!  New Music in the McNally stereo .. what you ask? D-Tweezy (D12). Their newest c.d. entitled "D12 World" featuring 'My Band' and '40 oz.' is pretty awesome. Just more music with Eminem that is off the charts. I also got the J-Kwon c.d. about a week ago called "Hood Hop" and it too is has some pretty sick songs.   Well thats all i can think of for right now ... Calgary will be looking to take a 3-1 series lead on the Detroit Red Wings tonight (COME ON CALGARY!) and the Tampa Bay Lightning will be looking to sweep the Montreal Canadiens tonight (something that the San Jose Sharks could've done last night .. but DIDNT!)  Im out ... later  p.s. Automated Therapist freakin rules ... 102.1, THE EDGE!
