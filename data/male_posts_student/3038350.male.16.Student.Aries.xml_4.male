Well last night me and Ed had lots of fun, first Cyndi, Ed and I went to the Beaver Valley Mall and hung out for awhile. Then we came back to my house and we watched a good movie, Freaky Friday.  Me and Ed laid in eachother's arms til they had to go. I was sad for him to leave but at least I did get to see him for awhile.  Him and his family are going to come up after Graduation. I was kinda hoping that they could come to the ceremony but that is ok, they will come up afterwards.  I was crying at skewl today because it is the last time I am prolly going to see most of them peoples. some I will see such as Jinay-fer and Crystal aka (Grieta Cabeza) Well I need to go get ready to go now.. I will write later ok? love you all and I love you soo much Ed! TTYL ~Donna~
