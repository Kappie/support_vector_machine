S to the tinga!  my flow is crazy and it aint no thing-a!  now that that nonsense is out of the way, welcome to the resurrected wing night!! blog.  i noticed that adam has booted me off ask madden, and rightly so i suppose seeing as i did not blog for a fortnight or so.  (fortnight definition, anyone?  streva?)  maybe i'll keep this one up to date, we'll have to play it out.  i have a lot of devastating crap i could tell you, but i'm bottling it up for now.  we'll see how shit goes down.  i am posting from ali's room simultaneously with joeflyy because we know how to get shit done.  i'm taking off for new  hemp shire on saturday.  i'll be there for a few weeks.  and, no, i was never in idaho.  miscommunication i sum it up to be.  yeh well i'm out cuz i don't like to type, especially when it has to make sense.    1
