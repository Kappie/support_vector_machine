I like  urlLink Monty Python . I especially like  urlLink  The Office  . Very funny. I not only like it because it's British, but because I work in an office.  I had a really good Memorial Day. I went to a picnic, ran errands, painted a wall in our room, went to Wal-mart a few times, watched   urlLink  The Office  , visited my wife's grandmother, cleaned the apartment and ate pizza.   Like I said, we visited my wife's grandmother yesterday. I didn't really want to, because I knew she'd find something for me to do. That's what she does. If you visit her, she finds a chore for you to do.  Because we were in the area, we went and visited my wife's grandmother. We were there for about 10 minutes then she said, "I know what you can do for me..." as if she had been searching for chores that she wanted done. The special chore that she found for me to do was to put a table crafts together for her. Luckily for us, the table was in the trunk of her friend's car and her friend was nowhere to be found. Because I'm nice, I told her I'd put it together for her today after work.   I didn't go straight over to her house after work. I was exhausted and stressed from work today. I wanted to let mullet man (that's my mother in-law's cousin) put it together, but his elbow is broken and I wasn't going to go back on my word.  I went over to her apartment this evening and put the table together. It was too exciting. I had all the parts stewn out all over the living room floor. She sat and watched me. I couldn't help but feel like someone had conned her into buying this table. I think there's a group of men who meet in a secret room somewhere who invent crappy products for the elderly. To make the buyer feel patriotic, they slap an American flag on the box, call their company, for example, AmeriCo, but the product is made in China. Sad.  Anyway, I put the table together in about 30 minutes. She let me take the box back to my place so I could throw it in my apartment complex's dumpster.   I really like my wife's grandmother. She is really nice, seriously. I'm not being sarcastic. Really.  Word.
