Despite all the half days... this has been the longest week in a long time.  I watched some VMA's tonight.  Coldplay actually won.  I was happy about that.  I was more surprised really.  Kind of weird how much people like Justin Timberlake had to say about them.  So that was tight.  Umm yeah I don't know what I'm going to do this weekend.  Probably sit around like I always do.  I don't know what else to do... honestly.  So I'll sit home tomorrow and probably the rest of the weekend.  I think TBS has a special on Memorial Day where they're playing a much of Martin Lawrence movies.  I'll probably watch that.  Fun.  I don't know.  -19640.77 -1965.76
