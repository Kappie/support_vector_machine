Was like going to go nuts anytime man... lol. We were so 'patriotic', singing national day songs during geography test ! haha.. couldnt remember whats the other one, I laughed too much, it slipped off my mind... =x   Yeah, was a kinda good day for me too.. sunny.. hehe. That stupid idiot came to school, but didnt disturb me or what... and i stayed back after school to do library duty for the first time ever since school started... lol, kinda slack sia.. but i did do my part ! =D  Didnt have much appetite at dinner just now, just ate a few mouthfuls and i pushed the plate away.. don't know why too...  Tomorrow after school, I'll be off to Tampines Mall to celebrate the girls birthday.. Joei's falls on today, Jarael's tomorrow, and Karie's on Sunday.. wah... all like very close.. den i spent a big bill on my gifts... T_T lol..  So thats about it, I'll be buying a gift for Jarael tml, in the form of topping up the money needed for trade in for a new X430... she wanna change the colour.. so yeah, forgot to buy gift, guess this is the best for her le.. haha.  Looking forward to tomorrow, and waiting for that someone....
