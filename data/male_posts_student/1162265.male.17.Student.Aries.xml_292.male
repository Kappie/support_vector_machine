Anyway, this book is about the first people to travel to Mars to colonize it.  It starts of in 2026, and although the technology doesn't seem to have advanced all that much (the book was made in 1993) it has quite a few interesting things.  First, the book is hyper-realistic.  The way Robinson describes Mars, he makes it seem like your actually their.  This was before we were positive that life lived on Mars though, but besides this minor faux-pas which brings you back to reality, he'll say things like "we never knew about these things from Space".    What's even color is that the book shows Stanley's view of the future of humanity.  He basically believes, one can assume from his book, that people are the only form of intelligent life that is relevant to us.  So it's our job to spread around the entire universe, and create life in worlds that are largely dead.  Very interesting stuff.  I'm not even up to the part where they start to Terraform mars yet.  I hadn't thought I'd enjoy the book, but I think I'm going to buy the follow ups of "Green Mars" and "Blue Mars".
