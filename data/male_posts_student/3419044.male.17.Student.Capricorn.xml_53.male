As we are talking, my Dad stands up and kinda gave my Mom a look.  He walks outside comes back in with Icon Super-Duty boots.  I was so surprised and grateful.  I was talking to them earlier about how I thought I should invest in some boots as every rider recommends them.  Well, I guess they do listen to me.  They said the reason the bought them was for the point previous and that I had a rough school year.  They said they were proud of me for the amount of school that I missed.  They said I missed alot, but never skipped a beat.  Thanks Mom and Dad!   	  The words "comfort" and "street boots" were never before closely associated. The all new Super-Duty boot is the first riding boot you will not be dying to get off your feet at the end of the ride. Super-Duty boots offer the protection you want in a serious riding boot and the styling of your favorite casual shoes. 	         · Hardened ankle, toe, and heel cups. 	· Molded plastic shift level nubs protects boot and offers incredible response. 	· Mid-foot stabilizer strap with Aluminum positive lock buckle. 	· Protected Nylon speed lacing system. 	· Padded Leather upper for comfortable "over-the-ankle" support. 	· Stitched on rubber outsole for traction and comfort.   urlLink ICON: Ride Among Us     urlLink    Icon Super-Duty
