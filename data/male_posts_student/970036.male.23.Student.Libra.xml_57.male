If it's the intention of the National Hockey League to ensure a great percentage of Canadian university undergraduates perform poorly on their final exams and term projects, then I say they've been  dangerously successful . Why in their right mind would they schedule the most important part of the hockey season for April!? What makes this year's hockey season even more distracting is the way the Edmonton Oilers are vying for a playoff spot. I swear, this team will be the death of us, the way they wait until the last game of the season to potentially seal the deal, playing havoc on our stressed-out nerves at every turn.  Bah! I'm so far behind on schoolwork it's not even funny - maybe it's best that they  don't  make the playoffs. For my GPA's sake.    Currently: Ploughing through an insane amount of readings
