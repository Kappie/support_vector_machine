I felt as if I had to explain why I will most likely not post here from July 10 to July 17 (those are the days we'll be gone).  I only write good stuff while it's raining, and it's not raining right now, so all of my writing sucks oranges.  In an effort to prove to you that my blog is worth reading, I'll go back to the roots of the blogging world, and I'll attempt to describe to you everything that is prancing around my troubled mind as of this very moment.  I am so sick and tired of this crud.  It's as if my fan doesn't even know that I want it to blow on me.  I know that my bed is covered with suitcases, and I suppose they could be blocking the air coming from the fan, but it's just so inconsiderate of the fan to not even think about my temperature-related needs.  The only reason I carried it's sorry base home from Wal-Mart is the fact that I was hot at the time, and I needed some constant air flow.  The girl at the gas station down the road didn't seem willing to come to my room to blow on me.  She said it sounded "gross," but I just needed some air, that's all.  And now that I finally have something to blow on me whenever I want it to, it doesn't seem to be in the "mood."  You know, that's just like a fan.  I shouldn't have even expected anything good out of that thing.  I knew from the very beginning that we wouldn't be a good match.  And now I have to take a bath, because I am all hot and sweaty, and I stink.  Because nothing blew on me.  Okay, the next post will be better, becuase it will be later at night and I am a lot more emotional at night.  You can go to the toilet now, if you so desire.
