The new one of which is pretty lame i think... It doesn't get any better than saying email 100 times...  So, let's see, Chris's sister and brother are in town, her sister's boyfriend is here too, it's been pretty cool, we've been pretty busy.. Lotsa fun.. The first night we went to Karaoke, which is actually pretty fun. It's nothing like in Canada, where if you want to sing, you sing in front of a pile of strangers who boo you even if you're really good... Here, you get a private room, and the drinks are cheap, and you just sit around a table with just your friends... You don't even have to sing, but after a few buckets of beer are delivered, everyone is fighting of the microphone... I sang chiquatita by abba... yes.. yes that's right.. Well, I'm told that I sang it.. memory's a little hazy :S  We went to Macau yesterday, that was pretty cool, it's like the other Hong Kong. Except, you feel like you are in Europe, it's all portugese.. but still chinese.. hard to explain, but really cool.. They even have tons of mopeds and teeny tiny winding uphill alleyways.   I haven't got any time to get those photos online yet, but I'll get on it soon.. This blogging site doesn't exactly have photo publishing, you have to set up a separate service, but i'm told it integrates well with them.. but then again, i'm quite lazy, and have little tolerance for slow computers, or even effort in general..   I watched Twins Effect again last night, I'm becoming more and more under the impression that this is the single greatest movie ever made. It's rediculus, but what do you expect from a chinese kung fu vampire romantic comedy? Especially one starring Ekin and the Twins?? The teddy bear fight  urlLink scene  is still my favorite.  Oh yes, for those of you who i haven't force fed the movie to multiple times, it's called "Vampire Effect" in north america, and it's at rogers.. (the one in the centrum)  Go rent it now! NOW! (and don't watch the dubbed version, the dubbing is AWFUL)  I "read" something interesting in a magazine here... It was a chinese magazine, so it was more like looking at the pictures of all the ladies... Anyhoo, I saw an ad for Twins Effect 2! This should be interesting, Gillian had really weird hair though, like ancient chinese men's hair...  Speaking of movies, a great one a saw the other day is "Ong-Bak" the torrent file is on suprnova if you want to check it out, it's a thai kickboxer movie, complete with "Let's See That AGAIN! AND AGAIN! AND AGAIN! AND AGAIN!" type stunts, but it's amusing, I love how at the beginning he makes a promise to never ever use his supreme ass-whooping powers, you just know that's the time when you set your watch for 2 minutes from now... when the supreme ass-whooping frenzy begins.  The scens are pretty predictable, like, the hero gets chased down an alley-way, which is full of hawkers selling various fruits and precious fragile antiques, which are promptly squashed and smashed.. Also, guys seem to always carry some strange obstacle into the center of the path just as our hero is approaching. We then see him jump through the ring of barbed wire feet first, we then see him jump through the ring of barbed wire feet first, we then see him jump through the ring of barbed wire feet first, we then see him jump through the ring of barbed wire feet first, It's awesome!      It's cool to watch their legs, they bend in ways you wouldn't expect possible, somehow they can make their knees swing up and come out of their foreheads.. It's like they're aliens..  Considering how awesome it is, this post can only go downhill from here, so i'll end it.
