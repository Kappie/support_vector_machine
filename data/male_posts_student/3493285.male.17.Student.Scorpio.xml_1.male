Desperado. wow this song is so amazing. i always say "this is my favorite song" or "oh my gosh i love this song"..and yes i do love every song. but there's something about this song. there are a few others like it. it's one that can reach every emotion, every bone, every feeling, everything in my body. and i feel it running through me. desperado.....   You can no more seperate one life from another than you can seperate a breeze from the wind.  The human spirit knows, deep down, that all lives intersect. That death doesn't just take someone, it misses someone else, and in all the small distance between being taken and being missed, lives are changed.   Strangers are just family you have yet to come to know.  No life is a waste. The only time we waste is the time we spend thinking we are alone.  --some quotes from The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom.  that last quote sticks out to me. the only time we waste is time we spend thinking we are alone. if this is true..i've wasted a lot of time. i've actually recently tried to think differently. it is hard though. but i think so often when one thing sets us off..or maybe just me..i kind of have this dominoe effect into thinking that..i'm alone. and that nobody loves me. we're never alone..as easy as it may to convince ourselves of that, we're not. people do care. it's the truth. i would bet my LIFE that every single person on this Earth has at LEAST one person who loves them so much, that if they knew how much love was felt for them, they would have no reason to feel anything less than amazing. wouldnt it be great if we felt this all the time? wouldnt it be great if it didnt take death to realize how much we love somebody? i guess that saying you dont really know what you got till it's gone or maybe that song is right. you dont.    anyways on a more positive note WHEEEEEE!! choclate milkshakes good.
