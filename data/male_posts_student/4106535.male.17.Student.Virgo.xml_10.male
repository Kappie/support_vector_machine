No clue how to buy them though, so I just kinda emailed it to my Host Sister to figure out (I feel kinda guilty about that one). Oh yeah, please forgive this obsession phase.  I work tonight, it seems.  We're moving! not far..just a few miles thata' way, but nevertheless it's a new house, and a new neighborhood. I will really miss my neighbors :(  things are in boxes all over the place. We have to be out by friday- actually I have to go carry some things from the neighbors garages here right now.  Maybe I'll see you at work..
