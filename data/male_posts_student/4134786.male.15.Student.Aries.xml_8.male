I mean National Day is a good idea, the parade is usually fantastic, it's just that the songs are really really corny. And the way the choir people sang it... it was really awful. they're probably sec 1s. oh and the whole thing was centred on a total lack of plot or structure. bored out of my skull.  lol i found a singapore wiki.  urlLink http://www.sgwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page . quite sad. about 20 articles i think, on bus services and parking rates. should get more real articles but i think very few people would be bothered to write for it.
