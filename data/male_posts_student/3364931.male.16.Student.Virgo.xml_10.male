Err..no prizes for guessing whats the title of this song(in case you dont know,it's My Immortal by Evanessance)... Dedicated to no one in particular, jus had this song running over and over again my head. Being single, its perfectly normal to be thinking of all these kinds of stupid things...hahah..its kind of hard to like someone but not let the person know huh? but...being me as usual, i'll just wait and see how things go, never making the first move,yet quietly dropping hints to be picked up.Yet i know it may be just my puberty-induced hormones creating infactuastic-love commotion in my life to make it more interesting...but i'll still wait for a while more i guess...a little while more..  Today was tiring.Skool started again for the June Hols...and it dosen't end till the second last week of the hols...like i said, what holidays ? I seriously think the skool has some issues. What if we study too much and just before the O's we become mentally retarded ?  would they be happy then? Then my future will be gone ! haha....but seriously, O level year is no life man...but, looking far ahead, i ACTUALLY needed the extra lessons ( wow, i cant believe im saying this !)if i want my distinctions so that's the bottom line. No complaining anymore. But i have to tell you, the teachers that are teaching me are great.. I mean, how can you find a group of approachable and down-to-earth teachers in a bundle (teachers like Miss Lee, Wendy, Cindy....it goes on)? so i guess thats my good fortune and i have to make good use of it !  Wendy Loi came up to me today while ordering food. She actually told me it is possible for me to get a distinction. Checking if she may have been drunk or may have mixed my identity with some first express class student with thick glasses holding a thick book wherever he goes, i realised that she was looking me straight in the eye. I was like....oh okay cool ! i can actually get a distinction ! if i work at it,that is. I never realise that she thought i had potential. Therefore this spurs me to do better in my POA. hahah...yeah thats about it for today then...boring life i have here... Sign out.
