From  urlLink Dave Barry's website :  What message would you like to send to the teenagers of America?  Your hats are backward.  Also, he points out in an article today in the  urlLink Mercury News  that with a recall election including the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger ("Ach'll be bahck"), Bill Simon ("I  am  a credible candidate, dammit!"), Cruz Bustamante (vote against the recall but for me!), Gary Coleman (funnily short former security guard), Larry Flynt (paraplegic porn playboy), and Mary Carey (a porn star who has really "promised tax deductions for lap dances and an anti-violence program that would let people trade guns for X-rated videos"), we "greedy Californians" are about to cause Florida to "lose the coveted title of 'The Doofus State.'...  "To make matters worse, Gray [Davis] lost the state budget surplus...it's gone. They've looked everywhere, but they can't find it. It's the Weapon of Mass Destruction of budget surpluses... So now Gray is spectacularly unpopular... When he tries to get into the governor's house, his own dog attacks him... Of course California is not the first state to [be] led by a known bonehead. Many other states have gone through this...the way they have traditionally handled it is to pretend that the bonehead is competent and popular, thus causing him to be so impressed with himself that he resigns from the governorship and runs for president of the United States.  "But California has a unique system of government, known technically as the 'Any Random Loon Can Put Any Random Thing on the Ballot if Enough Random Loons Agree' system. If you're a Californian, and you want to put something to a statewide vote, all you have to do is gather a couple of million signatures. That sounds like a lot, but in California you can get that many signatures in 45 minutes merely by approaching disgruntled motorists gridlocked on a freeway during rush hour (6:30 am to 11:30 pm)... As a result, Californians are constantly voting on things. They have repealed gravity several times."
