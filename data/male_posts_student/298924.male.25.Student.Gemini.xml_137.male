Last night I saw the episode of Martin when he and Bruh man got a job selling bootleg shirts at the Whitney Houston concert....the shirts said "Whitty Huton" and had a picture of Bruh Man with a wig....I laughed my black ass off....I still giggle about it....now all I need to see is the episode of Living Single when Kyle Barker gets a fish and names it after himself, then the fish eats all the other fish in the tank....for some reason I love that episode....  Today is the last day of one of my jobs....at least, the last day that students will be here....there is an awards ceremony today....I really hope all of them go on to have much success....  Well I think I need to get an early start....gotta send some bills off...
