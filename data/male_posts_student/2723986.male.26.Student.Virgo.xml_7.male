Not a bad turnaround from my previous 78% in calculusâ€¦  I spent most of the weekend with Rebecca, the highlight being a 15-mile hike over Mt. Hamilton.  It was a bit chilly, but clear, so we got to see some great views of the Columbia River Gorge on the way up.  There was even a good deal of snow at the top and we had fun tossing snowballs and watching our dogs wrestle around in the powder.  We also finally got to go see 50 First Dates, and it turned out to be better than I expected.  There are definitely some good, quotable one-liners in it.
