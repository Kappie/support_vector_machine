Yes it had tons of action and fighting and sometimes some suspense, but it would start some bits of plots and not evolve them...it would skip from a start of an evolving storyline to a big action packed fight which would then lead to another not fully understood story. Yes, i havent seen the first Riddick Pitch Black, but people tell me that the first was just as confusing.   
In the beginning you see Riddick running away from some bounty hunters (which supposedly is five years after the events in Pitch Black). After fiddling around on Inam's planet (Inam being one of Riddicks old pals) we find out that there was a girl named Jack (which he supposedly saved in the previous movie) that has been put into a prison...so he goes and saves her, but she gets taken away by mercs, and then he goes after her again, and she ends up dieing and he becomes the leader of the mercs...thats the whole movie in a nutshell.   Now, the battles and fighting by Vin Diesel are awesome and very intense...and there are some really cool parts where he shows off his skills as a Feore (the race the Riddick is which is something that the Lord Marshall is afraid of and the reason why the mercs are all after him (to destroy the Feorian race forever)). anyway, there were plenty of times when there was also a ton of computer graphics, which made it look totally fake...but if you are really into the movie you can kind of look past that (since it is in space on some weird planets). So, in general, The Chronicles of Riddick is a movie i wouldnt recommend seeing, but if you are a person who loves action and computer graphics and is usually too dumb to pick up any plots (like the Matrix), then this is the movie for you...and by the way...the ending was the thing that made me actually start to dislike it...it was horrible, but im not gonna ruin it for those who are actually willing to go see it for themselves.
