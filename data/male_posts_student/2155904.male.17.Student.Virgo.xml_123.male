Mr. Kinker is on the southeast side of Tyke as he types.  But he just got up and moved so now he is more south but a little west.  And laughing.  And moved again.  But that would take a long time to continually do updates on so he will stop.  Now.  Yep.  Now.  Ok, so this is really quite weird.  Cuz Tyke usually talks what he is saying through while he does it but he isn't now.  And he usually takes breaks from writing which is pretty much the main reason for Tyke taking so long to complete each night's activities.  So here goes for Saturday though.  Tyke got up nice and late on Saturday.  12:30.  He easily could have slept longer too.  But he didn't want to waste the entire day.  So Tyke pretty much did nothing all day.  He ate some bfast after getting up and then traversed around the house accomplishing pretty much nothing.  But then he started to play ESPN and that was fun.  He played it for a really long time and realized something.  It got hard to improve his player so he made a new one later on at night.  He made Kinker and Tyke realized it is much easier to do what Tyke found out than what he had been doing.  So thats how that went.  And then Tyke got a few phone calls throughout the day.  And they were fine.  Not much relevance to any other ideas or actions of Tyke but they were satisfying in their ways.  Man, this is really weird.  Tyke feels like he is talking to Kinker right now because as Tyke types, Kinker reads.  But since they aren't speaking to each other it is just like it is...eh, it's weird.  Kinker agrees that it is weird.  After the phone calls and such, Tyke got himself his lunch.  It was pizza.  Good pizza.  Day old pizza which many times tastes better than the first day pizza.  But it was heated up for 45 seconds in the microwave and Tyke ate it thoroughly.  With A Cream Soda on the side.  In a can though.  Not just in a pool of cream soda'd goodness.  Then Tyke putzed around more and more and played ESPN and later on he even ate dinner.  It was really good.  French toast and scrambled eggs.  For dinner.  Mmmmmy goodness.  Then a little later Macaroon came over and they played a little Soul Calibur II.  Then Kinker joined.  And they played some more but decided they wanted to play cards instead.  So as they were doling out the chip quantities Skippy walked in.  And he got in on the action as well.  So they all played for a while.  This night was much different from the last.  As Tyke did not buy in one extra time.  Only the initial.  And he ended up getting way ahead but played a little silly and lost some of his winnings.  He still got $7.50 though.  The winnings paid out in $4 and a free slice card from Pie.  Which will be very valuable come Thursday or Friday.  That is a good win for him.  After that they played Halo.  And it was really funny.  Just cuz they were being super silly...ous (get it?).  They played for a while and then decided to watch the most recent Talking Sex episode.  It was even more hilarious this time Tyke watched it than the last he thinks.  Things are funnier when everybody else is laughing hard at them.  So things were funny funny this time.  It was really good.  Best episode yet according to Tyke...at least at the moment.  Skippy left during the show and it was just the three boys left.  After that they played Shithead for a few rounds but then decided to do something new.  Tyke made up the inverse of Shithead or "The Shit" and they played that.  All cards that are dealt up are actually dealt down and all down cards are up.  It makes for a really hard time trying to guess what is in your hand since you can't see it.  It might even be better than Chinko.  But the first playing is always the best.  After that is where you really find out the quality of the game.  So a few games of that passed and the night was pretty much completed.  And then Tyke blogged.  With Kinker's eye over his shoulder.  Not like directly but indirectly.  And probably not now either cuz then Tyke would hear Kinker laughing and he isn't.  So yeah, he still isn't.  Ok, well this was quite a little escapade.  Night is done.  Now.
