I stayed at the canteen with my class mates..Soffian and Bryan..We eat and relax together.. While we are eating in the canteen..We saw musbah!!lolx(is Farhan,musbah is his dad)he is having PE..Wow! So after eating..I went to join farhan.. Today I had five lessons of design technology..Very boring..So I went to play basketball with my friends..keng yeong and yew siang..haha..We trained for the inter house which held in the afternoon...We play and play until the final bell rang..lolx..Forgot about our lessons..shit..NV do work again..lolx..But never mind..Mr song don't care about it..He is the worst teacher I ever seen..wah piang..So unlucky to have him as my sec 5 DnT teacher.. After school..I had my inter-house basketball..And my team won 58-40..Easy win..I almost fight with a sec 3 boy..lolx..Stupid idiot.. While I was on my way to my soccer training which held at Yishun Stadium..The weather began to rain heavily..haizz..I have to train in the rain again..Felt so restless and tired after the training..And I even got injured by one of my team mate..Just hope this injury will be alright by this Saturday because I have a match against Home United under 18.. Reached home..Study and study again..Have to study for Chinese again and again..Cannot stand it..Almost everyday I must study Chinese..But never mind..After 31 of may..i can have my FREEDOM..wow..lolx..Three more days to go!!
