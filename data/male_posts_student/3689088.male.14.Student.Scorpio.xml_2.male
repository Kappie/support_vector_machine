My friend Mike wrote the next chapter for his fiction, "The Signal". It's about a guy named Justin (not me) who manages to somehow get into heaven where he meets several personifications of various spirits, like Purity being a good or positive personification and Havoc being a bad one. It's turning out really well. You should read it, but I still have to ask Mike whether or not I should post the link here.  Next, I'm stuck on the next chapter to Tempest. I have no idea what the heck to write...probably 'cause I forgot it. Been too busy with exams and Planeshift II: Search  Destroy to do anything productive with Tempest.  Aurgh, this stupid thing isn't downloading. *smashes comp* Gosh I hate this thing...I dunno what's worse, a comp that won't even download or AOL...
