So this past week, I worked a lot.  a whole lot.  Ended up doing 4 straight doubles, Thur-Sun.  Lots of fun, lots of money, both of which I enjoy greatly.    Saturday night was an interesting night.  On deck 1, there was a 21st birthday party for this girl.  The party consisted of 5 very attractive girls and one very lucky guy (who quickly became the envy of the boat).  About midway through the cruise, I went down into the bathroom to wash away the sweat that was pouring down my face.  In walks the guy.  "Hey.  Y'see those girls I'm with?"  "Everybody's seen those girls you're with."  "Well one of 'em, it's her 21st birthday.  D'you have a girlfriend?"  "No."  "Well, she... she mentioned you.  Would you dance with her sometime tonight?"  "Yeah, of course."  And thus began a really interesting night (made even more interesting by DJ Dan's relentless effort to make a love connection right there in front of everyone.)  So at the end of the night, we exchanged numbers.  Dyl and I walked to Gov't Center so I could head home, and she called.  So we went out last night.  It was fun.  She's fun.  We had 3 and a half hours of interesting conversation, a nice, filling dinner, and a nice walk back to Gov't Center from the North End.    It was a great night.  Helped take my mind of the things that have been bothering me lately.  Entirely.  Well, here's hoping it keeps up. ::crossing fingers::  We may go out again tonight.  Say a prayer... this could be good.
