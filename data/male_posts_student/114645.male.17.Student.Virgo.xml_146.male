Why is life funny? Because it has it's ups and downs, but you always end up having fun in the end. I'm out of my depressed mood I have been in all week. Maybe it is because it is Friday or maybe because I have realized that I am trying to hard to find someone. Let that someone come to me. And if they don't, then oh well. I will find someone eventually, right? Right.   Now onto today's events:  Today we were on assembly schedule. Why they schedule an assembly in the same week as the week before finals is way beyond me. Well, that is Rancho's wonderful administration. That or someone forgot to look at the calendar. We just reviewed in mainly all my classes. I actually understand what is going on in Physics. We are working with heat and when stuff vaporizes and whatnot. It is fun! And I know how to do it, which is a plus. We watched Charlotte Grey in French. Thank god it isn't in French. I like to watch movies in French, but I don't like to be tested on them with only knowing them in French, lol.   Then in Aviation, we just reviewed. Shamara (the cheerleader that sounds like a man) puked. Kinda the same way Mr. Kelly did. It was funny. American Lit was just review, and in History we watched Andersonville some more. Math we reviewed and in French Aide I watched the Count of Monte Cristo. That is a good movie. If you haven't seen it, you should. That was my day. I will probably be going to happy hour tonight with the parental units, and study, study, study this weekend. Fun!
