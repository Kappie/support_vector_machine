A little out of the ordinary because our concerts are usually on thurs. but as you all know we have a rehearsal on Fri. and me and chelsea being the incredibly strong-minded people that we are have decided that this weekends rehearsal is more important the this band concert, considering LMS and such...Seems that much more imperative to me because prom is Sat. and i have to leave early to make it to Prom and the party bus and such but neways. Chelsea says to Gantt, hey me and Pat have a rehearsal on Friday that we cant miss. And he throws the "Gantt" speech. (  Gantt Speech : An infamous speech given by the pedagogue William Gantt whenever something doesn't seem to work out for him. ) But anyways she got the speech and she was pretty pissed...As for me i realize where he's coming from, i really do. The only difference between me and the normal person is i just dont give a   bleep , so i kinda just was like yea its not an option for me im going to that rehearsal.   Patrick what does this have to do with anything? Well alot because Patrick and Chelsea have just really commited thierselves to the corps by picking BDB over VHSMB. You may not understand the significance but as of now we play very significant roles and being absent from these positions tend to upset people, people that we have to see every single day.   BDB: 1 VHS: 0   SCORE
