Brooke is making french toast this morning and I'm getting ready for school. I think we are going to a graphic design "place" to day for my class. I can't remember the name but the guy does some sweet work. Well I'm done eating my french toast and it was excellent as usual. I have to go now. I'm going to try to keep this updated again.I'm so busy and it never works :(
