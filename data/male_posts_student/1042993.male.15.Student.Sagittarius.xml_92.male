I haven't seen any problems posted on the w.blogger website, but they may be in the process of updating their site and hopefully the program itself.  I just moved away from  urlLink Sygate  (as I posted about in my previous post) and moved back to  urlLink Zone Alarm Pro .  I refuse to go to the free edition because of flaws in the latest release of it.   urlLink SpySweeper released its latest upgrade a few days ago.  Be sure to download it.   There are a lot of new and revised features, as well as the latest definitions.  PeerGuardian seems to be working fine now.  I was getting the "DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL" error in XP just about 30 minutes ago, but I fixed it by updating my drivers for my ethernet card to the latest XP release.  I downloaded  urlLink SpywareBlaster  again and got the latest release.  It was giving me problems in the old version, so I thought I would give this a try.   urlLink Leo  showed off Spyware Blaster in one of his tips on G4TechTV Screen Savers.  In case you're wondering, I will never call "The Screen Savers" by its original name ever again while it is associated with G4.  From now on when referring to TSS I will call it G4TSS, G4TechTV Screen Savers, or G4TTV TSS.  Right now I am in the process of reading   urlLink The Da Vinci Code  , but I am putting that off for now while I finish watching  urlLink G.I. Jane .
