I am peeing blood with my urine (UGH!) and might be passing kidneystones. :( I'm like 16, can i get Kidney stones?  Now I have to strain my Pee... Great.  My second load of computer parts aren't here yet. Yesterday, I ordered some speakers too and a new sound card. 5.1 =  Fucking awesome   I can't wait for my skates to arrive... They might actually fit and not bruise my feet.  No work tomorrow( and probably Monday) because I have a doctors note!
