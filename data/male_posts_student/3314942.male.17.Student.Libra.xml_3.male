Im talking about how fast  everything  goes. Today everybody was speeding on the highway...the day blew by...i ended up home without realizing i was home...everyhthing seems to be moving so much faster. Maybe the world is spinning faster. Maybe im just losing control over what i normally call "control".  Throughout these past few days, i would have a train of thought and realize that i really wanted to write it down in this thing. BUt now, as i have found time to do it, nothing comes to me. Its like a pen sitting in front of you waiting to be used, but every time you need to use its run out of ink. I dont know why i made a metaphor for somethign that was clear to begin with.   Today i played 4-square. Today i talked about my art to people who didnt care. Today i did a lot of things which nobody will know about, or more importantly care about. Today was a day like many other days, except for the fact, that it was most certainly today. today i thought about people. Some that i care about, and some that i dont.   This post seems like one of those overly melodramatic things which i scoff it from time to time. It's different because i wrote it though. Thats all thats necessary.  I am currently listening to: Yo La Tengo- Summer Sun
