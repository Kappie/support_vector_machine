Me and CQ were waiting outside the Chem Prac lab. CQ saw this monkey ran past into the opposite lab. I was like "what?". Suddenly, we heard glass crashing from that lab. Then we saw a monkey ran out and into an empty classroom. Then leh, our class started coming along with S25. We alerted then that there was a monkey in the classroom they were passing by. Everyone then crowded around and watched.  HaHa! That monkey tried to get out, but the windows were closed. It fell down many times, and everytime it fell, the girls would scream. Haha. Then it ran out and somehow jumped down to the first floor. By then, quite a number of people gathered outside because of our screams. It went into a classroom full of people and soon, everyone came out screaming. Now, all the PJ people came out and watched. It's like...wow. A monkey can attract so much attention! Everyone was screaming and meowing.   Okay. You see, there's this landscape between two opposite blocks. In that landscape, there was a pond. You can guess what happened la. SPLASH! In went the monkey. AHHHHHHH! Screamed the Pioneers. Luckily, the monkey got out. It was quite a shallow pond, actually.   Mrs Jasima then arrived and shooed us away. Heh heh. I heard that a teacher managed to lock it inside a classroom, and someone got rid of it la. Don't know who. I huess it is animal control ba.   Anyhoo, practical was a rush. Wow! Two experiments in a day! We were all very late for the Physics Lecture. I guess this late-coming is gonna be a regular thing. Heh heh. I partnered with Zahiah and we have such great 'chemistry'. Forgive the intentional pun. No la. We had fun working with each other. We cheated on the second experiment, as there was no time. We did half of the experiments each. Heh heh.   Okay. Blah blah blah through the day. Oh yes! We had Physics SPA. Ayioh! It was so darn easy! PY was saying it was tough and stuff. O.O She likes to exaggerate things de. Heh heh.   Today in choir, we had photo-taking. HaHa. Because of the constant moving of chairs and benches and the arrangment, it took us nearly an hour to take the pictures. HaHa. It was worth it though. I wished I could only stand besides Ah Ji. That JS ruined the boys' Raffles pose. Ergh!   After that, we had practice till 8.15!! Oh my god! We kept singing John's song leh. So horrible. I felt kinda small. I think I am one of the worst Tenors. I had JS sharing that "glory" with me. Eeee... I don't want to be placed in the same category as him. I am, after all, much more experienced than him. Sigh.   Anyhoo, me and Gloria decided to go MacDonalds to eat. It was already 9+, and we were feeling very hungry. Both of us ate the 4-piece McNugggets and regular Coke.   I arrived home at 9.40+. After bathing, I arranged my Chinese file and came online lor. Now, I am waiting for my phone to charge. Heh Heh.   Well, I think that's all for today. Not bad right? Me and CQ can cause such excitement and mayhem in the school compound. Not bad lor! Pioneer spirit! Heh Heh. Enough crapping. Gotta be going. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!
