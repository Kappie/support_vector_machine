Right in front was the Torkham border post and slightly on the left (south) was the Timor lame prison where he handed out sentences to people. I wished I could have taken picture of it especially after having a peep of the area through the field glasses, but alas I had no camera on me. Also at Michni Post were some remains of the rocket fired by the Soviets during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, the remains salvaged by the Khyber Rifles were duly put on display. Around the border were various observation posts with names such as Big Ben and Little Ben and also some with slightly local names.  Another interesting fact I came to know about there was that the National Highway Authority (of Pakistan) had awarded a contract to Frontier Works Organisation (a semi military setup of Pakistan) to upgrade and rehabilitate the road from Torkham to Jalalabad. The entire area being in Afghanistan, why were all the parties involved from Pakistan?
