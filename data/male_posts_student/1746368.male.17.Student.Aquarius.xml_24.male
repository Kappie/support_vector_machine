Her mom gave me a ride home and now, with a long string of events, I get to go to Sunset church service at 6:00!   Now, I have had this journal for little over a week, and I have to say I love how much it helps me. I have always been in need of a way to express my feelings, and this is just perfect. It is something that is easy to update, and works great with just what I need. If anybody is looking for some kind of journal editor Blogger is it. Thanks for listening everyone. I will probably be back to retell what happened at church. Let Jesus put grace, into the lack, to make a great impact.
