Second, We tried to play a card game, and end up simply playing the sacred game of 52 pickup. Yippee. Third, my shoe was captured, and people played soccer with it. Yes, my shoe. Finally, a little guy with glasses. When he had to leave, for some reason he just wouldn't stop laughing! I don't get it! We didn't do anything funny! He just started laughing! So remember this incident when you here the phrase "Drugs are bad for you."
