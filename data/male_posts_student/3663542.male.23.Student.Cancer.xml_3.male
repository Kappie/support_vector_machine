I'm about to go away, but I need to get hold of Holly first. I've been debating what I should wear for the dance on Saturday, because its carnival theamed. I was thinking of wearing my capoeira pants, and such, but I'm scared to stand out too much, and I would have to be barefoot, and that's not comfortable, besides I doubt anyone would get it. OR I could go the other way and walk around with juggling stuff all night, but I hate having things on me, I never know what to do with them, besides only clubs or devil sticks would be really cool, and I would do those for like 5 min, and get board, so I figure ill just go normal and such.  k... well...
