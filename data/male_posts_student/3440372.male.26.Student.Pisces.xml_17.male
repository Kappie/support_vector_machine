I was first inducted to this rarefied institution couple of weeks after my 18th birthday. There was an initiation and everything. I was made to smoke two large bags of ganja and then perform a series of pointless tasks:  task one - to renounce all previous good deeds and promise never to do anything energetic again, on what would be pain of death if all the other members of the Guild weren't lazy potheads. So it will probably just be mild annoyance.  Task two - whilst being extremely smashed the initiate (me) had to order take away for six people from three different restaurants. This might sound like an easy one, but just try it. To get it wrong would mean that somebody's munchies were not satisfied. The guilt from this would be unbearable.  Task three - (by far the hardest) the 4 AM trip to the local 24-hour petrol station with eight people waiting back at the house for an assortment of chocolate, fizzy drinks and the charcoal briquettes (there's always one). Again this sound simple, and it would be if it weren't for the enormous pressure of forgetting a Milky Way on Mars bar.  After initiation I embarked on an illustrious career of doing very little, but doing it in a stylish and interesting way. There were parties, drugs, drink, other people (I think), the police, coastguard (there was a helicopter so must have been them), more parties, orbital, orbital, orbital, orbital, small amounts of crime, new trainers, havok, headaches, stomach aches, more headaches, bladder pain, sweating, more bladder pain, nosebleeds, blood coming from the corner of my eye, realisation that most of the people I knew were absolutely undeniably crazy, more serious bladder pain, hospital's, hospitals and more Fucking hospital's, dark prognosis from doctors, ignorance of all doctors advice, doctors saying "no seriously, you have to chill out", more ignoring of doctors, lots and lots inadvisable drink and drugs, this bladder pain is quite serious now, hospitals, headaches, hospitals, massive amounts of pain and then as if from nowhere a startling realisation took hold:    maybe if I chill out a little bit, my life may start to sort itself out    No shit Sherlock!! So I stopped, made a reasonably clean break from all the stuff that was stressing me out and put my life on track. Not sure if there should be a sense of achievement just because you stopped being a total Twat, but I felt it.  Anyway, had a point, I am sure I did. Oh yes for the past three hours I have worked solidly and unflinchingly at one subject and made some quite reasonable progress. I think I'm developing a work ethic. But it is just come to my attention, that I'm not actually working instead I'm posting on here. Idiot. I had no need to worry. Thought I had my life on track and was working studiously towards my degree. But it turns out that I'm still frighteningly able to avoid work for ages without even noticing. Oh happy day!  :: ranting hurts ::
