First, a distinction that comes from a gay friend of a friend.  The gay guy hates "fags" or his own derogitory term for gay guys who are so flamboyant that they are almost a characture of gay men.  But he enjoys gay guys, basically regular old people who happen to be gay.  I would think that the fashion guy on Queer Eye would raise some red flags in the queer community because he is so flamboyant and constantly makes referrences to gay sex-as though that's the only thing that he cares about.  And that maybe, but its dangerious to have this guy so front and center because it merely perpetrates the myth that's all gay guys thing about.  I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe a large part of gay culture is being different and flaunting their sexuality.  Its just from what I see coming across on the screen, the actions further myths and pigeonhole gay men as being funny, into clothes and sex.  Why can't there be just a regular gay guy on?  Like the food guy?  He seems pretty regular and decent and doesn't have to constantly announce his choice of sexuality.  I guess its different because I would be a part of the majority and don't think that I have to use my sexuality necessarily to define my personality, but for gay men or women in general, that is the big difference and in part is what gives them a sense of community.  I realize that I don't have much footing for what is written, but it just seems that while on the one hand it seems great that this show is enjoying so much success, it may ultimately backfire, for the American populous is going to see distinct stereotypes from a few individuals and jump to conclusions.  Whether the fault lies on the people making the assumptions or those that put the show together is an entirely different story.
