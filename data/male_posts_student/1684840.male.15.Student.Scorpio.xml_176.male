We are studying things to do with witches and satan etc. for the next few weeks so it should be fun.  Physics was really interesting; we learnt about how transformers worked, which has always been something that has puzzled me.  We learnt how currents could be trippled just by using a bit of iron and coils of wire, which begs the question - Why can't we power the whole world from one super-powerstation with thousands of gigantic transormers?  I was also amazed by the fact that the UK's National Grid system is quite unique compared to how the rest of the world's countries generate their power.  Anyway, Information Systems was a normal experience followed by dinner.  Spent the first half in the library then the second half sitting in the arboretum (isn't as beautiful as it sounds) with Craig, eventually joined by James, Michaela  Gang, Oliver, Sam and Chris.  English was okay today.  We did two Carol Ann Duffy poems in one lesson.  Mrs. Audouin split the class up into two groups and we did one poem each, then merged afterwards.  These poems weren't as good as ones we have done in other lessons this week.  Maths was quite good today.  Mrs. Lawley set us doing work out of the text book for three quarters of the lesson which totally messed with my head    Overworked and exhausted after a long week at school, it was home time at last.  Having been asked 4 times already today, I don't think I could face another "When are you leaving Caaaarl?" from anyone.  But it came anyway... twice, during the small period that is registration. Our reports are going to be given out next Tuesday so I've heard; I can't wait to see what I've got!  A mufti day is fast approaching soon also, and I don't care that we have been asked to wear sports clothing.  I am wearing my "Byte Me" t-shirt and jeans.  Nobody can stop me, and after all:     Google: Definitions of sport on the Web:    An active diversion requiring physical exertion and competition.   Technically, that includes pie-eating contests, fishing, darts, speed reading, programming contests, jelly wrestling, kicking Brannan up the arse, watching Lord of the Rings, farting contests, family arguments and throwing paper aeroplanes at the Big Issue seller.    I have a sudden urge to start writing a story again.  Many fresh ideas have crossed my mind and I feel much maturer than when I wrote bits to others when I was younger so maybe, just maybe, this time they will be better.  I might give it a go... after reading Harry Potter 4 and 5 again
