Excuse me??  Nice to see the NYT ran the story on page  urlLink A-16 .  A-16?!  Is this NOT news??  I guess it won't be news until they can get a picture of Cheney shoving those docs down Berger's pants when he isn't looking.    The LA Times ran the story under a section called  urlLink 'In Brief' .  Come on, can anyone honestly talk about a 'balanced' media in the face of this crap?  And now the NYT is running a correction about the  urlLink 'Niger'  reference in the State of the Union.  Wow, they just got around to fixing it?  Or is the urge to misquote Bush so undeniable?  Imagine if a Republican had done something this stupid?  And Berger used to be the National Security Advisor!  Was he not clear about the meaning of security?  Was this a routine method of document transportation?  I know when I come home from work, I'm always finding documents in my pants.  Happens all the time.  Sheesh....   Update - Kerry has cut Berger loose as an 'advisor' to his campaign.  But this incident actually occurred six or seven months ago.  How long has Kerry known about this incident?  What did Berger show Kerry?  Why didn't he act on this earlier?  Another Update - From the  urlLink NYT    "Mr. Berger does not want any issue surrounding the 9/11 commission to be used for partisan purposes," Lanny Breuer, Mr. Berger's attorney, told The Associated Press late this afternoon.    Pardon me while I laugh like a constipated Frenchman.     The decision to step aside came after a day in which Republicans zeroed in on the disclosure that Mr. Berger, who was President Bill Clinton's national security adviser, removed classified documents from the National Archives last year.    Republicans are zeroed in on this??  How about normal law abiding Americans concerned that important information is walking out of secured areas in the pants of a man who once held a post that had the word 'Security' in the title??  Is the NYT convinced that only Republicans are worried about obeying the law?   While Democrats had seemed inclined to give Mr. Berger the benefit of the doubt and accept his explanation that the incident with the documents was inadvertent, Republicans were decidedly less charitable.   So violating national security should be met with charity??  Unbelievable.
