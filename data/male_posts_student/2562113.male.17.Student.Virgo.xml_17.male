Woke up at 2:30PM today to face the challenge of setting up my wireless router. I almost had to have computer-guru Bob stop by and help me out with it, but I somehow managed to get it to work. Now I have my own computer, and internet access anywhere in my house, including the deck and backyard if you REALLY want to go hardcore.  My computer's temporary layout really blows. It's set up on my tiny-ass nightstand next to my bed. In order to have it all fit on there, I had to switch my HUGE monitor with the thin, more manageable flatscreen monitor that my family was using with their computer. My brother was PISSED when he saw that I switched the monitors, but I think he's over it because I set him up with Counter-Strike. My parents offered to go to Ikea and buy a computer table for me sometime soon, so hopefully I won't be using this god damn nightstand forever!  Earlier tonight, Bob brought up the idea of everyone going Moonlight Bowling, so I went to pick up Adam. As my car pulled up his driveway, I noticed smoke coming from the hood. Great! I frantically shut the car off and open the hood. It smelled of burnt rubber, but I was unable to locate the source of the smoke, as it was windy on the mountain. There were no more problems with the K-Wagon for the rest of the night, despite the thing roars like a "Spivic" from needing a new exhaust.  Me and Adam met up with Bob, Lauren, Jacquie, Jena, Chris, and Lauren's cousin at Bob's house. They were all listening to hypnotic music, eating, and staring at funky Winamp visualizations. Looks like Bob's new bong had some action tonight, heh. We got to the bowling alley at 11:25 and the fucking faggot at the front desk tells us that Moonlight Bowling is on Saturday, and the bowling alley closes in 5 minutes. Fuck! So we drove to Blockbuster, watched Lord Of The Rings at Bob's for a little while (I do NOT understand that movie), and went home shortly after. Jammed to Guns N' Roses "Paradise City" while driving back.  Here I am again, on my computer. As I glance over at my TV screen, I see that some fool wrote the words "Clean Me" in the dust. Thanks for the reminder, asshole.  -BIGsmut.
