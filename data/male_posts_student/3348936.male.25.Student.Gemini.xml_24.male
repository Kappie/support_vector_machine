For those of you that don't know, this is were a hair folicule grows the wrong way round. i.e. pointing inwards instead of out.  So this is my first day back at work.  Of course everything seems to have fallen apart while I was away.  But that is not too surprising.  On better news have upgraded my computer with a new sound card and 5.1 speakers.  Having afew teething troubles with it but aleast i haven't got interference on the sound channel anymore.  I highly recommend getting an external sound card. Mine's a Creative Audigy 2 NX and gives brillant sound quality and the software that comes with it is pretty nifty...
