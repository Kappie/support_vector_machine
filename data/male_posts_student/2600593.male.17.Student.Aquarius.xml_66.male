      I have just got " urlLink Just for Fun - The Linus Torvald Story " from a friend. I just got about a couple chapters in to it, and I already like it.   If you ever wanted to know about the making of Linux this is the book to read!!!   Currently Listening to " Light up My Room" by Barenaked Ladies.
