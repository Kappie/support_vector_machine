There's no telling how many great blogger submissions this computer has taken to the graveyard. Somehow it senses when I'm at my most vulnerable and it freezes up the file I'm working on. Dammit I hate losing what I've worked for.  I don't even know how to begin again anymore. Where do I start? I'll start again tomorrow....I'm going to bed.
