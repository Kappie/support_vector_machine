According to  urlLink Bunnie Diehl , Kid Rock and Britney Spears will be performing at the  Republican  National Convention!   NOOOOOOOO!  For goodness sake, what will Kid Rock sing that will be suitable for Republicans?  Is Britney actually going to get dressed for this performance?  Dear Lord, what were the Convention planners thinking?  Okay, so MTV isn't really producing the Convention, but one would think so.  I just pray that there will be no "wardrobe malfunctions."  We had better look out though, because comedian Margaret Cho has said that she is going to try to get arrested at the Convention.  This sounds like it will be quite an interesting time for the Republican Party.  Other stars who will be appearing at the RNC will be Dennis Miller, Lee Ann Womack, Brooks and Dunn, and Kelsey Grammar.
