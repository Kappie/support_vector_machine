Jonah : "Nobody is as awesome as Jonah.  If there were an emperor of awesome, it would be he.  One time, I looked up awesome in the dictionary and saw his picture.  And not just any picture - an awesome picture.  It showed him being awesome by driving an awesome car into a pool of flaming sharks.  And that's what he does on his less awesome days.  Most of the time he's like 10 times as awesome as that."  Nathan "Wow, that Nathan, he sure isn't gay.  Not gay at all.  Totally un-gay.  So not gay, he's straight," (girls)'I'm happy" (guys) "Too bad"   Sophia "Yeah, she's a really great girl once you get to know her.  I promise, she's not always psychotic!"  Marten  "Cool. Original, but classic. That guy is even more awesome than Jonah." but the conversation is more likely to go like this: "what a loser." "shut up! he's cool" "isn't.""ass" the second person probably being Thomas. I think I took this one too far.  It is his love, it is his life, it is his fault he didn't lock the garage!
