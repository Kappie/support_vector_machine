Today, ...hmm... well today wasn't anything much more than the tomorrow that i worried about yesterday.  My mom's boyfriend came in to help lay the new kitchen floor.  I took my dog Pepper on a walk, but she started to take a crap in someone's yard so we had to come home early so she could finish it in her own yard.  I spent a good part of the day working on the computer.  I had to format the HD and use the 'system restore' thing for about the 100th time.  The comp is 4 years old; i guess thats probably a senior citizen in the comp world.  I had to get on the roof and clean the dryer vent, and then i got a pizza and 2 beef boats from Pizza King.  mmm.  We've been eating takeout for a week or two now because our kitchen isn't much other than a half empty...or i guess half full fridge because of all the work we are doing in the front room....or maybe the fridge is just twice as big as it needs to be....hmmmm. Well, anyway, i'll leave now.  I think i've done this blog as much justice as i can right now.
