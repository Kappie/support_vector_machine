How goes it? I'm just sitting here, procrastinating on my biology homework, as per usual... so I figured i'd put up a random and incoherent post. Those, sometimes, are the best posts of them all. See, what am I even talking about? I'm incoherent talking about how i'm going to be incoherent... that's just... well, incoherent.  So the trade deadline has passed, and for those of us lucky enough to be in Canada, all 6 OR 7 HOURS OF COVERAGE ON TV is over. Seriously, it was just a little much. But i'm happy with our deals.. Ron Francis, although slow and dangerous behind the wheel, still does serve a purpose. Chad Kilger is apparently a "project", so in other words, he sucks right now. Cally Johansson? Eh, sure why not. He's unproven if he can still play, but apparently good. He has a funny accent too, so that more than makes up for it. "I came here to win da cup, that's the only reason." Well hey, we could use you, Mr. Johansson.  Speaking of hockey, Tood Bertuzzi is a  no-good, stupid, cheap, jerk of a goon.  That hit was just totally retarded for so many reasons. Punches the guy out, and then just lands on top of him  BREAKING HIS NECK.  Apparently he is "remorseful"... BS.  Why did you do it in the first place, Todd? I will now call him Re-Todd. Re-Todd Bertuzzi. Yeah, I know I stole it from The Edge, but it works.   School really, really... sucks. I'm so...  average.  My marks are all low to mid 80's, which is fine I guess, but it's not what i'm used to. I feel like some teachers think i'm completely stupid. I'm expecting my Chemistry teacher to come up to me and say "Dave, here is a ball... perhaps you'd like to play with it." At least I am making up for it in my two morning classes, where my intelligence is being insulted. Peer Tutoring? I DON'T DO ANYTHING. Nothing at all. I just sit there and answer Grade 9 english questions. We're watching a movie the next couple of days... feel the joy.  The good news is, life's going good, as i'm sure it is for Legaxy X as well. He'll be up next with a post, as i'm outta here. Always remember,   Writer's Revolution: Where Nothing Can Possiblie Go Wrong... Er, PossibLY Go Wrong...
