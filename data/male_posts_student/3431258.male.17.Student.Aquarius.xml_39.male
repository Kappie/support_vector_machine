Don't listen to what people say about it being a gay non-plot outrage to today's hollywood art. Critics are only good at molesting your brain, violating your mind. At first i tought it would be a flop without taste. I was blown away and my flesh was torn apart in millions of pieces. The action is non-stop, special effects are astounding and i can assure you that the combats are to be remembered. If you don't expect a novel of a story out of this beast, you will be satisfied!   Actually i'm downloading the .avi right now. I will probably go watch it again tommorow. I saw a cute girl at the cinema, also some old friends :  Vinicius Vilena ,  Felipe  and  Julio  from  Drummond School .  Regards,  Zephyr
