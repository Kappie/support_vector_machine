I woke up really late b/c my sleep schedule is ALL messed up and I'm not usually getting to bed until 2 or 3 in the morning; this is going to have to change before I start my job on Monday (at 8 AM!).  Then I decided I wasn't going to trim the bushes because it looked like it was going to rain and it was cold out (it stayed cold out all day, but it didn't rain).  So I decided to TRY to do something useful and learn how to make up a table of contents in Word and manipulate things in it (ok, so maybe it wasn't TOTALLY due to abstract self-betterment; I need to know how to do it for my job Monday), but I can't find anyplace that has a tutorial on it!  The Net didn't have anything, Stow library didn't have anything, and neither did KSU's library!  So there went a wasted three hours looking for that.  So maybe the only "good" thing that happened all day was my workout.  I have to admit, I've always been one of those kinds of people who hated to work out; I mean, what's the point it making yourself sweaty, tired, and sore when you don't have a purpose to it (i.e. not playing a sport, working in a heavy-lifting job, etc.)?  But I think that my perspective might be changing; since I stopped playing baseball three years ago I've pretty much "let myself go," and now I'm really self-conscious.  So I finally decided when I got back from DC that it's time to do something about it, so now I'm on Atkins and working out 5 days a week.  And I'm swimming again (which feels great!) - today I swam 1100 yards, so I think I'm simply going to try to up my yardage by 100 yards every day I swim until I'm finally up to a mile (which is only 1600 yards, so I'm not very far away).  Then I just need to start building up some stamina; I never was a distance swimmer (I swam the sprint events when I did it competitively, never really swimming anything over 100 yards); right now I can barely do 100 yards before I have to stop and rest.  OK, so I'm sure I've totally bored everyone (but if anyone wants to "talk shop" about swimming, drop me a line!).  Oh, and I ran into one of my former professors while I was at the pool; she had been reading my DC blog while I was away, and she was telling me how much she liked it and everything.  For some reason she thought I "gave her hope in your generation," so I didn't have the heart to tell her that I hold virtually the opposite perspective then her on her primary issue (direct democracy - she loves it, I think that it's best to have most decision-making power with a few).  Anyway...on the more philosophic side of things, I'm feeling acutely alone lately.  It seems that everyone has girlfriends or boyfriends or just good close friends, and as usual I'm on the outside looking in.  And maybe the worst thing is that I just don't think I'm dating material; like I said before, I'm self-conscious, and besides that I'm not particularly engaging, witty, or kind, so I don't really have anything to "offer."  And on top of that, I'm not even participating in any of the type of activities where one usually finds anyone, so my social life is pretty dismal right now.  So that's one big downer right now; I keep seeing other people (and listening to country music) and remember all the feelings and great things about being with someone, and it just feels like there's a huge hole inside me.
