Brick definitly stole the show with such lines as:     "I heard bears can smell periods. They are attracted to menstration."   "I ate a red candle"   "I don't know what we are yelling about! LOUD NOISES!"   Ron Burgundy- "I thought you said this was a shortcut Brick?"  Brick- "Fantastic!"  Ron- "That doesn't really answer my question"  Brick- "OK!"     Don't forget Ron Burgundy's lines:     "San Diego...which is German for a whale's vagina..."   "Anchormen!....ASSEMBLE!!...*Blows on random seashell*"   "I'm Ron Burgendy?"  Ed-"Who put a question mark on the teleprompter?"   "GO FUCK YOURSELVES SAN DIEGO"  (somebody tricked him by writing that on the teleprompter)     They had a suprising amount of other funny movie stars scattered throughout the film. Ben Stiller, Jack Black...that guy from Dodgeball....   Anyways good movie, I might see it again
