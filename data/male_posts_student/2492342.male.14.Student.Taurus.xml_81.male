Wrote graffiti on a wall in pen'iscola. "FUCK" and the word "no" next to a thing that said "moros no" 3. Jaywalked in Madrid. 4. I went to an over 16 pub in Valencia. 5. Ditched the group at the Prado with brittany and christine and went to the market and museo reina sofia. I had a list before in my head..i think i forgot one.  im worried about aps and finals.  i only have 2 serious finals tho in that week. english is may 4, and no history final. so i have bio and math(spanish doesnt count) that week. thats easy. i think im prepared for ap history exam, even tho i didnt study. I seem to know a lot of it.  The year went by so quickly.  I gave Becky a really pretty bracelet. It was supposed to be a gift for Brighton but she pissed me off unintentionally on her part. Supposedly becky really liked it, because aria asked her about it and she said alex shams gave it to her and she got worried when aria pretended to drop into the water. she yelled no. its turquoise and goldish colored.  bio test monday.  the pictures of the guy stefan went after, which she really wanted to see, werent developed when my mom came. she brought other pictures tho.   ive taken a lot of random tests tonight. ill die april 17, 2063. ill sleep with 2 people, and ill love one.  me and aisha switched sex testts, i e we took them for eachother. lol   ive been bothering mikes .....relation.... cindy tonight. i asked her to have sex with me and she freaked out. what....prudes? i guess. theyre so scared of every little thing. lol. stranger sex all the way. ;)    i like black. its pretty.  gonna look for more personality tests. its late.   much love  peace  ~alex
