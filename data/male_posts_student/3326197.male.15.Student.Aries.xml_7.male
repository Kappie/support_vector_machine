Today I had my English exam and Geography Exam. They were alright. I got my p.e marks back... it was I think 25 outta 30, I guess it's alright, atleast I finally beat Ian (he got 24), and yeah. It's cold. Where's Tom and Mel? We were sposta study for the big maths exam tomorrow and they aren't back yet! I watched Angel today, it was a season finale, an old one but I haven't seen it. Apparently tomorrow it shows Angel all over again from the beginning! Like, Sha! They done that with Roswell! Honestly, people! Tsk Tsk. I shall throw a Frederick J Glimmerick at you for that. I'm tired. I think I might study... now. By myself *sniff*. :(. Oh the sanity of it all (because there is no need for insanity in a place like this). Blue. Fourteen. Child. Ice cream. Indignant fried chicken. You work it out. cya. -Jay
