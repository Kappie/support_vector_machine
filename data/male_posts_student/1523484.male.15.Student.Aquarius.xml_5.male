The song, entitled "Across the Nation" by  urlLink the Union Underground , is quite catchy and very energetic.  I downloaded it yesterday and I still can't stop playing it.  Believe it or not, I'd actually dance to it if I heard it in a club or at a dance.  And those of you who know me know that I'm not very much of a person for dancing.  Neither is  urlLink Kenny  as far as I can remember.  Heh, although I did enjoy his little dance back in the good, ol' days of Mazz's.  Kenny just put up his hood and went to town, bouncing up and down like crazy.  Very funny, indeed.  Anyhow, their website doesn't have the  urlLink lyrics and audio  for this song, so I'll just hook ya up with the lyrics  urlLink here  and an audio sample  urlLink here  (note that Windows Media Player is required (sorry, that's the best I can do)).  Hope you like it.  :)
