I was accepted for next year, but would have had to fill out an application every year. This tests waves those applications. Patrick took it going into 9th and they asked questions such as Who was Charlemagne? What country did Columbus sail from? The problems like a this word is to this word as that word is to that word type, etc. It sounds kind of like the PSAT or something. However, its all verbal!!! You might pray for me that I would do well.
