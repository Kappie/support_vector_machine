My parents always say this saying " Time travels when u get older" which is totally true because of how much stuff we do, we forget about the time and stuff like that. It just sucks like in 2 days i start band camp in the hot texas sun for many grueling hours and in 2 years i graduate. so yeah think about what you really should be doing instead of watching tv or sleeping because time flies when ur having fun so live life to the fullest. Peace out and have a good one!
