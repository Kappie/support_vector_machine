My birthday, got to spend it fencing. I fenced with Ibti, Sam and Leslie. I'm happy to see Sam fencing again, I got to remember to thank Leslie for that. How I love her, Something about Leslie that really turns me on. Sorry to go off topic. I have to get everyone tournament ready, the team has the skill to go all the way but they need the experience to be confident and the only way to do that is through tournament play.
