So you ever just wish you had that special someone right by your side but it feels like their a million miles away? It sucks even more when you know they could be right in front of your face I wish I could see heather more. Is describe the events of this weekend but I don't have the drive or motivation not to mention it was extremely uneventful. Well that's all for now.
