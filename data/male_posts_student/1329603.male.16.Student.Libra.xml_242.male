I manage to sod pretty much everything up, so why not my GCSEs while I'm at it?  I managed to complicate my own personal situation (which you know what it is but will remain unsaid) very much on Saturday. Because I'm very very clever. Yep. I suck.  Anyhow, yeah, got wind band soon. Joy of joys. Haven't talked to any of the girls for a few days. Ack.  Me = idiot.  Quote of the day: "Whatever makes you happy. Whatever you want. You're so very special, I wish I was special."  From Radiohead's   Creep
