Not that she does actually listen, more like hears, maybe not even that.  I am like the perverbial (sp?  I need to get a blog with a fucking spell check, what kind of cheap ass site doesn't even have fucking spell check?) tree in the forest.  I have known my wife for ten years and she has no fucking clue who I am or what I want.  She is mean to me or makes mean comments about my family (disclaimer, my family is odd).  I get laid about once every lunar cycle.  I get complements about once every blue moon and I get a break about once every trip around the sun.  Fuck!  I try to be nice and act like a cival person.  I didn't have a single beer today at a family picnic.  Primarily because I'd be the only one drinking (what a bunch of fucking bores) but also because I thought my wife would be impressed and maybe I catch a break.  Instead her family decides to stay for fucking ever.  Did I bitch about it?  Hell no.  What's the point?  My wife's mom has made it clear any time my wife feels like leaving me her mom would take her in in a second.  No "work it out with him", no "did you ever consider that he drinks because he never gets laid"? "Nope, it's fuck the goyum, the cheap bastard!"  Ah I feel so warm.  I honesty believe that my mother-in-law would not be too torn up if I were to die.  She'd be content with my wife and my daughter.  I hope to Christ my daughter doesn't end up a fucking bitch like my wife and her mom.  I would be devastated to know that my daughter was going to ruin another man's life.  I think I'd actually cry.  I think I'm starting to understand this blogging crap.  I feel better already.  I want to curse and scream and beat the shite (deliberate mispelling for my Irish friend) out of someone.  At the end of the day I wonder if I am fucking crazy.  Either I should leave this women before she breaks me completly or maybe it's just not that bad and I like to complain like a women.  I mean seriously have you ever heard a women in Gen X bitch?  It is like they think the world is owed to them and that blow jobs are for birthday candles.  I can't stand nearly every women I meet that's my age because they complain all the time (Yes I see the irony in the fact that I am complaining about complaining.  Do you WANT to see me in the clock tower?)  Whaaaa, I don't make enough money!  Whaaaa, my husband only wants to fuck me. Whaaaa, my husband drinks too much.  Whaaa, I'm too old to have kids. Whaaa, Whaaa, Whaaa!  Fuck!  Oh well the bitch left me alone for five minutes.  I guess it's back into the ring.  Maybe I'll go have a beer first.  Dull the pain.
