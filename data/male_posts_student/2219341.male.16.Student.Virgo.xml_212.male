I FEEL SO ALONE!  i have felt alone for so so so so long.  i cant even remember the last time i felt... content?  i guess thats what im lookin for.  i guess happiness too in a way.  i want love.  i want it so bad.  i am depressed.  i can feel it all again.  ha... its all to familiar now.  in away it does feel different.  i feel stronger than i was before.  i can still stand.  but at the same time i feel so weak.  i havent felt this sad in such a long time.  i cant freakin cry like i need to cuz my mom is sittin here.  i wish she'd go away.  i want to be alone... its better to be alone and feel alone then to feel alone and yet still have people around you.  i guess it makes it less frustrating.  goodness... i am having such a hard time even tryin to describe how i feel.  i just cant stop crying.  i want so bad to be held.  i want so bad to be different.  i want support.  i want to feel loved again.  i want to trust someone.  i want to feel special.  right now all i feel is... nothing.  God, please just let me cry... hold me...
