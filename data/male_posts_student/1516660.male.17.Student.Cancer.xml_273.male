Me, Gloria and HuiLinh met first, then proceeded to Woodlands.   We met CQ, HM and SL. SL's colleagues came too. HaHa. Joyce and PY joined us later. I ate the Egg MacMuffin Meal. O.o! Quite okay lar. Me, CQ, Joyce, PY and Gloria first went to Joyce's house to get her donation cards, while the rest walked to school. Then, we took the train to Sembawang and walked to school. They discusssed a lot about JCs. HaHa.   We met up with Wendy and Chun in school. We went to the choir room first. Woah.... that idioitc Vincent became terribly crazy. He knocked his head against the wall repeatedly. Everyone said he's seeking attention, but he said he's punishing himself. Kinda stupid lar....Everybody don't like him. I can see why though...HaHa. Oh yes, Mdm Harn is on maternity leave (she's gonna be in a foul mood once her leave's over), so Mrs Tan temporary took over. O.o!!   We seniors went up to the gallery to watch the show. I was reading this comic of Wendy's. W.I.T.C.H. It's a nice comic! I love it! Of course, I love everything about magic... I'll be buying it and subsequent volumes! :D   After a long long speech by Mr Kok, the performance started. I wanna skip straight to the last segment, the choir performance. The first song, Under The Sea, honestly sucked. Lots of out-of-pitches....too high. Oh my... The second and last song, a medley of Madonna' songs, were better than the first one. Thank god! I noticed the choir bcame more relaxed...started swaying their bodies and all. Yeah. Good good. Did I mention that the compere (the male one) sucks? Oh god!!!  We watched some performances by the UGs. Ayiah...every year the same one la. Got a Kok Mun solo some more. HaHa! Sucks la.... :P After that, it was choir promotion time. Actually hor, we didn't much promotion la. We seniors stood around and chatted with each other. O.O!! After milling here and there, and some promotional attempts, we left at 12+.   All of us (the original grp who met earlier minus Sl's colleagues) went to Woodlands Central to eat. I ate laksa and a desert (dunnoe what name). After that, we walked around lor. At a shop right, me and  PY saw these really beautiful zodiac jigsaw puzzles that were selling really cheap ($5 for 1000 pieces, $3 for 500 pieces). However, Causeway's Jigsaw World sell these for $20+ you know. The cheap cheap ones are obviously fakes! O.o Can even tell from the box liao.   We went to Sheng Shiong and walked around. SL brought some sweets. After that, me, Gloria and HL went home together. I bathed, ate sharkfin (fake one la...$2 a bowl...but nice if you put lotsa pepper) and came online. after that, went out to eat dinner and rushed back to watch my Sat shows.   Here I am online, listening to my CDs again. Club Beats now ma. I now talking to XC. woah! His Taylor Collegue so good! I envy him you know. I wanted to go one....but I have no money. Sigh! Moo moo meow!  Before I go, I wanna express my well-wishes to WQ, who is sick in bed with the flu! I know it's hard on you...but you must cheng zhe! You can do it one!! Okay...gotta go now. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
