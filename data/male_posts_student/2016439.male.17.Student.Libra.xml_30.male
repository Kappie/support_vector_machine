After all the smiling, hugging, and kissing, and after the long car trip home, you get to thinking.  No, it's not about how thankful you are that you got to spend time with your family (not that I didn't think of that; I did that on the car trip back home), but rather that it's pretty much the weekend already which means...  School.  Really, do I have to go back?  I mean, I can miss a couple of days, weeks, or maybe even months?  How about this: you give me my diploma and I'll stop darkening your hallways.  Sound good?  Yeah, okay, so I'm a little out of it today, but I'm just not looking forward to going back to school.  Not that being home has been that great, either, but I have more freedom at home...kind of.  This has been a productive time off, but I don't want to go back to school and realize how none of it relates at all to what I'm doing at school.  This next week is going to be killer.  I have to finish my article for the  Echo  (of which I only have 2 sentences written), raise about a zillion dollars so that the  Echo  can actually go out (I learned that whenever you have an excessively large amount of money to deal with, it's best not to refer to it by its actual amount, but rather as a "zillion"; besides, it makes it sound harder), perform at a band concert our band's not ready to play at, and then on Saturday, go to All-Region Band tryouts.  Hell Week, anyone?  On a much brighter note, this year's halfway over.  When I think that I only have as much time between college and I right now as I did between the beginning of my sophomore year (which doesn't seem that long ago) and now, I get really warm and fuzzy inside.  This time next year's going to be really exciting as in a couple of weeks from now next year, I'll be receiving a letter from NYU telling me whether I made or not (at which point I would throw myself off of my room if I didn't, hehe).  Good times, eh?  Finally, I'd just like to give a tribute to sweet potato pie.  I mean, it's the best thing ever.  I ate a whole pie by myself yesterday, and could have eaten about 3 more.  My Aunt Chris's sweet potato pie is the best ever.  Perhaps I can call in on Monday and say that I'm lying in bed dying of sweet potato pie intoxication.  I'm sure that'd go over well.
