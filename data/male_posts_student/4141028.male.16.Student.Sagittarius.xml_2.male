I didn't care at first, I just thought she was going to strike up a casual conversation.  Wrong.  The first words out of her ugly ass mouth were "Hey baby, you got a girl?" I replied nicely, "No I don't really want a girlfriend right now." Then she proceeded to grab my ass. At this point I thought she might be mentally handicapped so I just laughed it off, but when she kept doing it, I got mad. So what I did was I decided to rape her.  The End.  I made that up.
