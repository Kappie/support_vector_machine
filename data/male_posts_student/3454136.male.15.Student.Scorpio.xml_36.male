I've gotten kinda bored of this blog thingie already... I guess it happens to the best of us, right? I'm prolly gonna spend less and less energy on each consecutive post and eventually stop... I no it's sad, I'll definitely miss my blog. It's just that..., I have more important stuff to do... Like I'd rather DO stuff instead of rambling on like a madman about things that really don't matter. Especially since posting REALLY takes up energy...  The way I look at it, the blog's gonna die sooner or later... I would like to keep it alive as long as possible though... However, I don't think I can do it by myself, so I'd like to ask my three team members to occasionally post here in my blog.  That's it for today. Btw, commenting's back to registered users.... I don't think HiddenAssassin will ever bother to come to my blog again... so... Anyways, if u MUST no something about my weekend.... M, L, and I skipped Sunday school again... Oh, and I went to the Toronto Zoo on saturday. Did u no pythons lays eggs while boas give live births? Never new that...  Hmm, today's lesson is: If u can't be something, be anti-something. Note: Like in my longer posts, my lesson here is most likely to cause u to crash and burn if u heed it... so, don't, OK?
