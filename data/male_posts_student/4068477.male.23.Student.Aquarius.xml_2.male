An outside job isnt fun in the rain. I would just go home and sleep, but i dont think the mrs. would like that. And if i did go home, she would make me clean or run errands. I would rather work and just get wet. Its past midnight and im still up causing of a pounding headache. I hope these things end when i get my glasses. Starting to make me mad. I titled my blog "who's to say?" because i think it fits for a lot of things in life. It part of a Pat Green song. If you are readingthis and u know who i am, you know that i am a "Greenhead" or just a big PG fan. Watched Starsky and Hutch tonight, i liked it but Kris didnt. (kris is the mrs.) She fell asleep half way through it which is nothing new. Dont think she has made it through a whole movie in a couple of years. Well im off to bed, till next time. TTTTM
