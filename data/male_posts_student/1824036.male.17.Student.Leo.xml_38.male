It used to be the local WB station would tape Smackdown off of UPN then play it on Saturday night at about 8ish depending on prior programming. But that ceased a little over a year ago.  Now alas I have my Smackdown back! I was the biggest fan for Smackdown. Everything on that show was awesome. They even had a TLC match on there that was awesome (Im talking about the one between Edge  Christian, the Dudleyz, the Hardyz, and Benoit  Jericho).  So since I have school the next day I usually just stay up until about 12:30 AM and then go to bed. For the most part I miss the best parts (seeing how most wrestling cards climax at the end of the show).  But lately I think that Smackdown has taken a turn for the better with the lottery. Getting Dudleys and Booker T on a trade and then getting RVD from a lottery pick. I think that RVD is supposed to be on Smackdown anyways...he just looks like a Smackdown person. And plus with Lesnar leaving...there is a pretty big void to fill. I think thats where Drew's Main Man comes into play. Booker is gonna dominate! He will be the next champ I know it!!!
