I dont know why, but some chilli was in my mouth, and I hadn't noticed. Weird, hunh?  I'm kinda tired. I dont want the day to go by... nor my laptop's battery; I finally got my docking station back. I HATE IT!!! The PC keeps undocking by itself, hahah.  I wanna get two more batteries. My PC can hold 3 at a time. The only bad thing is weigt. Meh. Hahah Wheeeeeeee!  So I just finished proof-reading this entry and I noticed that the first three paragraphs start with "I'm"
