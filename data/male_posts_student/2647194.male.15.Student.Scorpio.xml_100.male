Question: who hates being stuck somewhere with no money, no cell phone, nothing to do, and no ride? Anyone? Of course you do.  Question: Don’t you also hate it when your parents screw up and you have 4 hours of your time wasted? Of course you do.  Last night I was supposed to have driver’s education from 6 to 9, and it was supposedly class number 8. However, we arrived, I went in, and my mom left. I walk in on lesson number 6, which is about road rage, which I’ve already had.  --Problem: mom leaves without checking which lesson it is (I did ask her, repeatedly mark you, about which lesson it was).  So then I figure, well hey, if I go over to the Woodbury Junior High, I can call home and/or try to page my mom. To my luck, I discovered, after wandering about the school for a while (checking to see how dingy the classrooms were), that the only school personnel present was a librarian on the second floor. To my luck, the Counseling Office was unlocked and empty on the first floor, so I ducked in and used the phone in one of the offices.  --Problem: Dad isn’t home yet, and my mom obviously didn’t go home.  Hmm…what to do next? Nothing but wander about the school for about 10 more minutes. Then I figured I should call my dad again, so I stopped over at the PDQ gas station, and waited 10 for some random asshole to get off the phone. Just remember that I only had a dollar on me, which was quickly half-burned up in 1 phone call to my dad.  --Problem: Dad’s home, but doesn’t have the other car. Mom’s gone at a meeting. Dad tries to page mom several times.  If you were in a situation such as this, you might go for a walk. The time is now close to 7:00. I walk east for a while, eventually stopping at the Target Greatland. After asking where the hell the phones were, I used up the last 50 cents in another call to my Dad. Mom hasn’t called back after repeated pages, and potentially did not have her pager with her.  --Problem: Mom may not have pager with her, and I don’t know her cell phone number.  What would you do in a target store with 20 cents? Look at all the music and CDs you wish you could buy, of course. There were probably about 7 or 8 albums I wanted, but of course I couldn’t even afford 1 fucking song on iTunes.  --Problem: Stuck at a Target store with 20 cents and music all around you.  After wandering aimlessly about the store, watching the music videos of "Take Me Out", by Franz Ferdinand, and "Broken", by Seether featuring Amy Lee of Evanescence, I went outside. Time is now close to 8:00. I sit outside for an hour and 15 minutes, coughing on the smell of cigarette smoke, watching random people and couples go in and out of the store, and get offered a tattoo by 2 young assholes chanting "Waka-Waka." I overhear a conversation between a worker and a security personnel about something a "guy in a green Honda and his girlfriend did." I didn’t catch what they did.  Okay, so I’m sitting outside Target in Woodbury, watching the sunset. Alone. Romantic, huh? The time is nearing 9:00. I’ve made a habit of checking my watch every 5 minutes or so, just to make sure time didn’t stop altogether and leave me sitting in front of a Target for eternity.  At 9:15, the Red Fuckus (or, alternatively, Fuckusall), shows up.  So what really screwed me over last night?   Safeway in Woodbury changed their schedule.  My mom left too quickly, and never checked which lesson it was.  My dad didn’t bring the other car home last night instead of today.  My mom left her pager at home.  My mom didn’t have her cell phone on.  My mom didn’t give me the other cell phone (don’t know what that would have done).  My dad didn’t make an effort to borrow a car and pick me up.  The result?  1. Marooned on the concrete edge of the shrubbery bed at Target in Woodbury for 2 hours.  2. Now I'm sick.
