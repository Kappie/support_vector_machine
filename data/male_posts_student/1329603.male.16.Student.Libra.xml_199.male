But, perhaps I'm confused in the romantic sense, the kind of confusion that they sing about. Perhaps not. Actually surprisingly non-linked issue, Beccy hasn't yet emailed me. Hoping she will. She probably won't though. Oh well. Missing Lawa, like apparently she's missing me. How did I get 2 women in that paragraph?  Course the GYO audition's next week. It... kinda seems pointless in that they have asked me twice to enter without audition, and the grade entry level is 7. Not 8 with distinction. That's NYO. Next stop for me. Hopefully? Anyway, that'd rule so much. Smug level = through the roof a bit. But still. What's happening now? I can't put together a cogent few sentences...  Les Mis is finished. All of the cast, I'm in love with you.  I'm going to quit while I'm ahead. Uh... Lawa, wanna talk to ya. It's not urgent.  Quote of the day: "I had a dream my life would be So different from this hell I'm living, So different now from what it seemed... Now life has killed the dream I dreamed."  From   I Dreamed a Dream   from   Les Mis   Love, Jon Roskilly
