(i developing a fondness of using submachine guns over rifles...) my sniping was... what i think... ok-ok lor... (my best sniper rifle is SCOUT...) but i still sucks at using AWP...  i think i'll need to improve my camping skill and accuracy... but then again... playing too much CS is bad for health... (LOLZ !!!)  there still 4 hours before i go out... so...  what should i do now ???
