Royce Nunley is the bass player for it ( EX: SUICIDE MACHINES  aka the bass player that was sweet before he left and the new gay guy joined SM, also the guy that was featured on  Destruction of Definition and Battle Hymns ).  That show should be seriously awesome and I really want to go.  More details are at their site.  Before I Go, a growing in popularity band from here in Michigan will play on the Warped Tour this year just as they did last year (On the local stage, just for the Michigan show),  In their recent mail sent via their mailing list, they had this to say:  "all im saying is get ready. if we're playing at the same time as NFG or some other douche bag band, we told you first. so show some love."  In other news Hanson is coming to town on August 11th.  Holy fuck guys, let's go.  MMbop ahfjsdkl akdjsfhl
