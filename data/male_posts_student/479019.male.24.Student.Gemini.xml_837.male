It snowed a lot and I chose to attempt going to class; however, the bus got stuck on the way there and I ended up walking 1/3 of the way to school... only to find out class was cancelled. So what I did was print out some stuff for class and hang out with Melissa on campus. It was cool. That was first time playing in snow... making snowballs and helping make a snowman. I don't count the fake snow they pumped into the quad in high school as real snow, nor the slush fight in Reno real snow. It was cool. Then I went with Melissa to the PAL meeting and met some nice people. They were much nicer there than at TASC. Some of us will probably go drinking Friday night.  Today I had lunch with Kazu. That was cool 'cause I haven't hung out with him in months. It was cool. We both bitched about our uncertain futures in grad school.  I'm going to hang around on campus a bit and go to a prof's office hours and see if my paper was dropped off in the Art History office.  I keep thinking there's something important I have to do tonight... but that whole 5 day weekend thing has be all thrown off.  ***
