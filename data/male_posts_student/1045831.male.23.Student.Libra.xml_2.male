I stay away from fat and carbs and that's it.  It's not hard at all except sometimes if your in the car finding something to eat isn't the easiest but I've discovered things in grocery stores and other places I can eat.  Also another hard part is no drinking but it's not hard so much that I can't drink but man hanging out with drunk people is so much more fun when you are drunk too.  How some people can do it all the time still amazes me.  But yeah I have lost 11 pounds since last Tuesday May 25.  Down from 240 to 229 and still going strong.  Next week I'm going to start working out in Lawrence when I go up there for class.  I also have been getting a lot of tips about becoming metrosexual so hopefully they will be coming.  I'm hoping to start being able to put pictures up here to document the transition from Drunk, frat, slob, party Zeke..  to Hip, Stylish, Sexy, Metrosexual Zeke..  But for now that's it..  So I'll try to keep you up dated more often..  Peace
