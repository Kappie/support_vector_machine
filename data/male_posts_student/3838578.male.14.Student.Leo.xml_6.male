I'm also sorry about all the poetic-ness going around here. I don't know why, I just felt like rhyming things with things. If you are wondering if I based "I wish I had said goodbye" off of something in my life, the anwser is no and it is  meant  to be dark and sad. I did it intentionally.  Soccer is looking up as we won the last game of the first half. I'm really glad we ended on the right foot. I may just drop by some practices if they aren't "Military-ish".  Well, Since the neighbours went to the lake, I found myself doing a lot of writing (not that I haven't been recieving pressure from peers, You know who you are!). I haven't just been writing, but enjoying myself.   Hakuna Matata! Anita
