Well I realized it was raining and all crappy outside too late for me to catch the bus, so I was forced to walk. It took forever, or atleast what seemed like it. Raining the whole time, figuring I was going to be late if I didn't hurry, I put my board down and started bombing some hills on this pretty busy road...it probably didn't help that I was riding on the other side, but I lived. So anyways, I get to work and all is fine except one thing got me a bit angry, and that was...my coworker Josh got into an accident a few weeks ago and totaled his car, well two of the managers were talking to him about the whole ordeal, standing in plain view of potential customers. I was in the back, washing a cup when my one manager comes to me and says, "Uh..Ian, you have a customer." WELL THANKS. As if the other kid who was standing there looking the customer into their eyes couldn't have helped them...whatever. So anyways, the one lady was scheduled to leave around 2:30 but she didn't "feel well"...shucks, so she left around 12:30. Then comes around 1:00 and I knew business was going to pick up, but my other coworker asked if he could go home, and she allowed him to. RIGHT after he left, it got packed, I was running around for an hour and a half straight, helping lines of people that I shouldn't have had to. If I got the help I was supposed to have, everyone of those people would've been out in a few minutes, but no. So that was quite annoying but, once again I survived. When the time to go home came around, I grabbed my stuff, went outside and decided to just skate home. So, I skated down Peach St., with the crazy drivers at my back, probably hoping for me to slip and have my head run over, but, again I survived. I made it all the way to JS Wilson, when a couple kids I goto school with offered me a ride, saying that they were going to his girlfriend's house, who lives right near me, so I humbly accepted the offer. They then told me that they left the theater the same time I did, in which I was amazed I got pretty close to my house so fast but...yeah, whatever.  So I get home, shower...relax and then when my sister's friends came over I agreed to watch Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade with them. I laid down on the couch and in no time I was asleep. I was woken up to be told I had a call from Vonda and she talked to me about doing something this evening, but because I so tired and don't even really remember what was said, I think she told me that we'd just cancel plans up to 9:00, when we'd go up and see Fahrenheit 9/11. So she called me a few hours later to wake me up and tell me she was coming...She picked me up, we went up to Tinseltown and, much to my dismay we were forced to buy tickets to the movie because it was selling too well. Oh well...Anyways, the documentary/movie was done VERY well and I enjoyed it much more than his previous 'Bowling for Columbine', because it was more fact based, than just his opinions. After the movie we went and just talked to a few fellow Tinseltown-ers and just hung out for a bit..then we came home. And..I'm hungry, so I'm going to go...yeah.
