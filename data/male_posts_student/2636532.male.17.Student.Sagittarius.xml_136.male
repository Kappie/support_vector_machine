But I did recently go out and buy some everclear (seen below). And man i tell you that stuff is crazy strong, kinda bought it on impulse it was $9.50 so how i pass that up right? but i really guess that summer makes us lazy, or me more specifically. I just don't feel like doing anything, but just to make me laugh and maybe provoke him again...  Fatty McTubtub Fatterson (aka Jason) likes to do shameful things to farm animals and and sell the photographs to small children.
