ANONYMOUS!!!! so, i said no to the crap that he offered, and then i just kinda pretended that he never offered it to me and forgot about it until i left...makes me sad. and he kept asking me to smoke it too, which just goes to tell you that smoking pot doesnt only make you stupid, it makes you addicted very easily. so, to all who read this (yes, all 3 of you) i say to you,"JUST SAY NO, OR YOU ARE A HOMO!" sorry about the whole homo  part of it, if you are in anyway offended, then i am deeply sorry and i will pray for you, but it just sounds like a catchy saying. ya, well im just glad im home and away from that crap. so anyways! i was going upstairs to do something i ferget what and all the lights were out cuz it was around 1130 and i didnt see my monster bass amp in the middle of the floor (obviously cuz the lights were out) and i bashed the side of my shin into the amp and i fell on the ground and couldnt stand on my lieg for awhile and my toes started going numb...im such a mess...think i can borrow someones body while they have to live with mine? thank you for offering. anyways its midnight and i havnt been able to sleep at all for the past 2 or 3 days, so im gonna go. its fracking hot in this house... bye
