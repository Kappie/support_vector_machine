I'm lookin to buy a truck, a Chevy most likely. Every time I go down to "the Chevy Dealer," Lewis, the dumbest fuckin' car salesman in the world, comes out and tries to make me buy something I don't want. What the fuck...  And don't tell me that a fuckin' Hyundai looks like a Jaguar. Help me out here, they don't look the same do they?  Anyway, back to Car Search 2004.  Well, with the money I'm supposed to get from my mom, and the cash I'll get from the car I'm driving now, it should all work out...I could even build the chopper I'm thinkin' of if I wanted.  A nice truck, a nice chopper...what more could a guy ask for?  Ok, two more things, and any guy will tell you this is true:  A good woman, and a load of cash.  Well that's all folks, maybe there'll be something tomorrow, maybe not. You'll just have to wait and see.
