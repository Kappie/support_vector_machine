(1:00:16 AM): downstream Donnie (1:00:19 AM): lol Donnie (1:00:24 AM): i mean symbolic Scott S. (1:00:24 AM): the flow of time Scott S. (1:00:29 AM): moves forward Scott S. (1:00:31 AM): downstream Donnie (1:00:35 AM): thats not symbolic! Donnie (1:00:40 AM): what i mean is Donnie (1:01:22 AM): are we eternally damned to be a puzzle broken into peices by the river, or does the current flow towards hope and possibility? Scott S. (1:01:35 AM): if i had that answer... Donnie (1:01:57 AM): then you would save me a lot of time Scott S. (1:02:02 AM): yes Scott S. (1:02:27 AM): im gonna save that question you just asked me Scott S. (1:02:29 AM): i like it Donnie (1:02:42 AM): whats the question? Scott S. (1:03:17 AM): are we eternally damned to be a puzzle broken into peices by the river, or does the current flow towards hope and possibility? Donnie (1:03:46 AM): ah Donnie (1:03:52 AM): i've always wondered that Scott S. (1:03:55 AM): yeah Donnie (1:04:06 AM): entropy, or extropy Scott S. (1:04:13 AM): right Donnie (1:04:14 AM): it's not a matter of choice, is it Scott S. (1:04:22 AM): i dont think so Donnie (1:04:47 AM): so has it already been determined, or will we beasts of humans decide our own fate subconciously Scott S. (1:05:05 AM): god, i've been thinking about this a lot lately Scott S. (1:05:12 AM): i keep going back and forth Donnie (1:05:16 AM): join the club. Donnie (1:05:32 AM): how do we not have a philosophy club in our school Donnie (1:05:42 AM): we have so many people that are interested in it Scott S. (1:05:43 AM): i dont know, but if we did Donnie (1:05:51 AM): always a but. Scott S. (1:06:01 AM): you're the only one i like talking about it with Donnie (1:06:18 AM): yea..i dont want to hear Rami tell me why ecofeminism will take over the earth Scott S. (1:06:25 AM): haha Donnie (1:06:46 AM): so, which side do you lean to at this moment. Donnie (1:06:59 AM): destruction or opportunity...its your call Scott S. (1:07:07 AM): oh geese Scott S. (1:07:38 AM): dont you already know my answer though? Donnie (1:07:47 AM): Not if you are going back and forth Scott S. (1:08:00 AM): i see fire Scott S. (1:08:03 AM): destruction Scott S. (1:08:07 AM): death Scott S. (1:08:11 AM): no more light Scott S. (1:08:13 AM): it's lost Scott S. (1:08:21 AM): why should I die? Donnie (1:08:21 AM): halocaust Donnie (1:08:30 AM): burning Scott S. (1:08:31 AM): see the saga through? Donnie (1:08:42 AM): perhaps there is yet something that can be accomplished Donnie (1:08:45 AM): a purpose of sorts Scott S. (1:09:16 AM): i only see one way two combat the flames of vengence though Scott S. (1:09:35 AM): a total refusal of our current system Donnie (1:09:56 AM): you propose to fight the flames of vengence with your own holocaust Scott S. (1:09:56 AM): which would mean a refusal of school and all structure what so ever Scott S. (1:10:04 AM): i know Scott S. (1:10:08 AM): i dont make sense Donnie (1:10:09 AM): fire will never defeat fire Scott S. (1:10:19 AM): only fuel a larger one yes Donnie (1:10:37 AM): aye, a tyrant amoung destructive times Scott S. (1:10:37 AM): so then let us remove ourselves from the fire! Donnie (1:10:44 AM): into space! awwwwaaayyy! Donnie (1:10:46 AM): lol Scott S. (1:10:48 AM): ha Donnie (1:10:54 AM): no no no. Donnie (1:11:03 AM): it is our duty to extinguish this fire Scott S. (1:11:12 AM): yes it is Donnie (1:11:20 AM): a fire that, make a note, is fueled by unjust morals and lost souls Scott S. (1:11:21 AM): but see, i'm sick of talking about it Scott S. (1:11:34 AM): I'm more than ready to begin Scott S. (1:11:40 AM): but i dont know how! Donnie (1:11:46 AM): just shoot Donnie (1:11:49 AM): shoot and dont look back Scott S. (1:11:51 AM): everyone always asks me "when's the revolution"? Scott S. (1:11:58 AM): and i say "soon" Scott S. (1:12:03 AM): but i dont know how to start! Donnie (1:13:06 AM): Well.. Donnie (1:13:22 AM): There are certain...decisions you must make before anything begins Scott S. (1:13:39 AM): like what Donnie (1:13:48 AM): Never leap blindly into the fire, Scott. For it's flames are decievingly hot. Scott S. (1:14:07 AM): but thats all i know how to do Scott S. (1:14:12 AM): shoot and dont look back Scott S. (1:14:20 AM): just start running... Donnie (1:14:24 AM): Then be prepared to be burned.. Donnie (1:14:34 AM): And take notice, with the fire, you only get once shot. Scott S. (1:14:43 AM): thats why i dont know how to start Scott S. (1:14:47 AM): i know I'm gonna fry Scott S. (1:14:58 AM): so i want to think of another way Donnie (1:15:13 AM): Then perhaps you should not reply soon any longer Scott S. (1:15:23 AM): huh? Donnie (1:15:29 AM): When's the revolution Donnie (1:15:31 AM): soon. Scott S. (1:15:35 AM): oh Scott S. (1:15:39 AM): but Donnie (1:15:44 AM): Say..not soon enough, but it will come Scott S. (1:15:51 AM): i need help! Donnie (1:16:12 AM): But far and wide you will have to look for help with such a dangerous subject! Donnie (1:16:54 AM): However..I can advise you partially Donnie (1:17:12 AM): First order of business: NEVER trust the little old man with the wispy beard Scott S. (1:17:13 AM): I would never ask you to do something you didnt want to do Scott S. (1:17:20 AM): ha, right Donnie (1:17:21 AM): I never said I didn't want to. Scott S. (1:17:27 AM): i know Scott S. (1:17:30 AM): just for the record Donnie (1:17:46 AM): throw the record in the fire Scott S. (1:17:53 AM): done Donnie (1:18:01 AM): then you can proceed Scott S. (1:18:07 AM): ok Donnie (1:18:15 AM): dont tangle yourself in the past, when the future is cumbersome enough Scott S. (1:18:23 AM): true Donnie (1:19:09 AM): You must decide....what type of revolution is in order Donnie (1:19:19 AM): You must factor in many many things from the world as it is now. Scott S. (1:19:31 AM): see thats the thing Donnie (1:19:47 AM): How can you proceed without supporters Scott S. (1:20:19 AM): I dont know Donnie (1:20:33 AM): we both knew it wouldnt be easy, right? Scott S. (1:20:40 AM): right Donnie (1:20:49 AM): im telling you man...Stalin knew what he was doing Scott S. (1:20:55 AM): yeah Donnie (1:20:56 AM): gain power slowly Donnie (1:20:57 AM): and friends Donnie (1:21:02 AM): the more the merrier Scott S. (1:21:05 AM): true  Scott S. (1:21:11 AM): but Donnie (1:21:17 AM): serious;y...we should start saying hello to every person that we know their name Scott S. (1:21:25 AM): ok Donnie (1:21:29 AM): if one person ends up supporting us, it was not a lost cause Scott S. (1:21:34 AM): right Scott S. (1:21:43 AM): but what is our cause Scott S. (1:21:51 AM): thats what i need to figure out Donnie (1:22:13 AM): well...do we need to exinguish the fire, create a more organized one, or just fuel it and let it burn out quickly. Donnie (1:22:24 AM): of of three paths lie before you Scott S. (1:22:28 AM): ooo, well said Scott S. (1:23:03 AM): well lets think Scott S. (1:23:17 AM): i want you to be my number one in all of this Scott S. (1:23:23 AM): we share power 50-50 Donnie (1:23:40 AM): Hmmm...make it 49 - 51 in your favor Scott S. (1:23:44 AM): ha Scott S. (1:23:46 AM): alrighty Donnie (1:24:01 AM): We'll do it like the Las Vegas business...49 51 Scott S. (1:24:05 AM): ok, so what would happen if there was no fire all of a sudden? Donnie (1:24:16 AM): a new one would surely spark Scott S. (1:24:19 AM): right Scott S. (1:24:22 AM): so Donnie (1:24:29 AM): however.. Donnie (1:25:00 AM): when there is no fire, there is no order. when there is no order, there is certainly a new group of people that restore their own order, thus sparking up a new fire. Scott S. (1:25:08 AM): right Donnie (1:25:12 AM): who's to say we couldn't be that group Scott S. (1:25:20 AM): god point Scott S. (1:25:43 AM): i mean Scott S. (1:25:44 AM): good Donnie (1:25:48 AM): understood Scott S. (1:26:05 AM): but what if we just tame it Scott S. (1:26:12 AM): nah Donnie (1:26:20 AM): less risk, less probability of success Scott S. (1:26:25 AM): yeah Scott S. (1:26:27 AM): exactly Donnie (1:26:36 AM): keep in mind that a fire is the quintessence of wild.. Scott S. (1:26:53 AM): right.. Scott S. (1:26:57 AM): i think. Donnie (1:27:01 AM): there is no order the the flicker of its fingers grasping at the air! Scott S. (1:27:11 AM): true! Scott S. (1:27:28 AM): so we are left with-fuel it and let it burn out quickly Scott S. (1:27:32 AM): pros and cons Donnie (1:27:42 AM): less personal Donnie (1:27:46 AM): we do our thing and wait Donnie (1:27:51 AM): perhaps adding this and that Scott S. (1:28:00 AM): and would probably involve.... force Donnie (1:28:00 AM): they both end in the same place...a new order Donnie (1:28:20 AM): perhaps emotional force could be used Scott S. (1:28:28 AM): hmm, interesting Scott S. (1:28:43 AM): well, which one are you leaning to? Scott S. (1:28:55 AM): i think i might actually think about extinguishing it Donnie (1:29:08 AM): sounds better Scott S. (1:29:16 AM): yeah, thats what im thinking Scott S. (1:29:26 AM): we should take lessons from ghandi also Donnie (1:29:32 AM): never read any of him Scott S. (1:29:44 AM): well, neither have i really Donnie (1:29:56 AM): oh. Scott S. (1:29:57 AM): i just know he used all non-viloent resistence Donnie (1:29:58 AM): he sounds wise though Donnie (1:30:02 AM): oh, cool. Scott S. (1:30:08 AM): i think that stuff is REALLY powerful Scott S. (1:30:14 AM): more so than violence even Scott S. (1:30:17 AM): sometimes Donnie (1:30:27 AM): Martin Luther King Jr. Scott S. (1:30:38 AM): right Donnie (1:30:46 AM): this will require some speechcraft, man Scott S. (1:30:56 AM): yeah it will Scott S. (1:31:07 AM): ok, so its decided Scott S. (1:31:14 AM): we put the damn thing out! Donnie (1:31:27 AM): there is always the option of just letting it burn Donnie (1:31:31 AM): its not running away Donnie (1:31:35 AM): dont think of it as that Scott S. (1:31:41 AM): ok Donnie (1:31:50 AM): but just leaving it, and going to another side of the world...perhaps checking up to see its status Scott S. (1:31:54 AM): but if we just let it burn, is that just doing nothing? Donnie (1:32:00 AM): well..yes Scott S. (1:32:24 AM): ...so we run away? Donnie (1:32:29 AM): no no. Donnie (1:32:43 AM): it's only running away if it is your duty to deal with it in the first place Scott S. (1:32:54 AM): isnt it though Donnie (1:32:56 AM): if you think that this was the reason you exist on this plane of existence...then i shall help Scott S. (1:33:15 AM): i finally feel like i have a purpose Scott S. (1:33:23 AM): you need not follow me Donnie (1:33:31 AM): i shall offer what i can Scott S. (1:34:05 AM): well, this is what i need the most help with at the moment- a begining objective Donnie (1:34:31 AM): no Scott S. (1:34:36 AM): thats how we can rally the people though Donnie (1:34:47 AM): that would be jumping towards the fire only half blind Scott S. (1:34:53 AM): ok Donnie (1:34:59 AM): dont act until you can deal with all possible consequences Scott S. (1:35:09 AM): well how do we prepare? Donnie (1:35:40 AM): brainstorm? plan things out well, you wont regret it Scott S. (1:36:15 AM): right, but.. we need an objective of some sort, if only for planing purposes Scott S. (1:36:27 AM): how can i plan if i dont know what im doing? Donnie (1:36:44 AM): On paper Scott S. (1:37:00 AM): yeah, put what on paper though? Donnie (1:37:05 AM): the pen is your sword! the ink is your blood! Donnie (1:37:33 AM): uh... Donnie (1:38:40 AM): a doctrine Scott S. (1:38:47 AM): hmm Donnie (1:38:51 AM): WHY do you want this Donnie (1:38:57 AM): why do you think it's your purpose Donnie (1:39:03 AM): who do you want Donnie (1:39:07 AM): why should they join you Scott S. (1:39:29 AM): but see thats the thing, we need to figure out what "this" is Donnie (1:39:51 AM): the extinguishment of the era, and the dawn of a greater order Scott S. (1:40:03 AM): well put Donnie (1:41:45 AM): how did i keep you online this late? Scott S. (1:42:11 AM): the possibilty of answered questions Donnie (1:42:24 AM): i am sorry if i have not fufilled that Scott S. (1:42:30 AM): no you have Donnie (1:42:35 AM): ah, then no regrets Scott S. (1:42:42 AM): start gaining support Donnie (1:43:00 AM): and you Scott S. (1:43:05 AM): but people want to know "WHAT are you wanting to do?" Scott S. (1:43:14 AM): thats what they always ask me Scott S. (1:43:19 AM): how do i respond to that? Donnie (1:43:25 AM): Hm. Scott S. (1:43:49 AM): we begin with a display! Donnie (1:43:55 AM): Ah. Scott S. (1:44:05 AM): a display to show all those that we are fed up Scott S. (1:44:12 AM): with the current system Donnie (1:44:30 AM): Better untangle the questions within yourself before you place them upon others Donnie (1:44:39 AM): We have time Scott S. (1:44:48 AM): time time Donnie (1:45:05 AM): Remember...you only get one shot Scott S. (1:45:14 AM): i dont think so Donnie (1:45:27 AM): the fire can consume you Scott S. (1:45:36 AM): i could yes Donnie (1:45:37 AM): depending on how much you touch it Donnie (1:45:44 AM): thats key. Donnie (1:45:56 AM): if you get too involved..you will only get one chance Scott S. (1:46:04 AM): yeah Donnie (1:46:06 AM): if you know when to quit and reflect on what to do, then you are ok Scott S. (1:46:15 AM): right Donnie (1:46:37 AM): dwell upon this Scott S. (1:46:56 AM): oh i will Donnie (1:47:08 AM): go to sleep with the quote "And so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past" Scott S. (1:47:18 AM): i cant sleep yet Scott S. (1:47:24 AM): much too much work to be done Donnie (1:47:32 AM): oh really Donnie (1:47:40 AM): see?! i distracted you waay too much Scott S. (1:47:47 AM): no Scott S. (1:47:49 AM): this was good Donnie (1:47:52 AM): ah ok Donnie (1:47:54 AM): no regrets Scott S. (1:47:58 AM): right Donnie (1:49:17 AM): however Donnie (1:49:24 AM): i have a TON of work to do in the morning Scott S.
