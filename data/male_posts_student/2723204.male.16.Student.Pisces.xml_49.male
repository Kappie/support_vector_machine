Why do we say that God is good, why don't we say God is the best? Well, best is the limit of good. And, by saying God is the best, we are saying God is limited. Well, a misconception is that God is so great and very very great until it borders to the realm of the limitless. Is pluto really that far? For us it is, but for people 50 years later its nothing more than 5 bus stops away.   How do you define heavy? If you say that God creating a stone so heavy he cannot lift. You are saying God is creating the heaviest stone using the most powerful might to lift it. But how heavy is heavy and how powerful is powerful? God doesn't operate in the realm of limits. This stone which god has created, its mass and weight can be measured. No matter how fantastic this measure is, it is still possible to measure it. Given time, a human being would be able to recreate this heavy stone. Given more time, biologists would be able to create some drug which would make us able to lift it. Epistemologically speaking, God has given us an ever-expanding intelligence, (dr. Ar Bernard talked about this once).   God doesn't work in heavy, difficult, those are terms of limitations. these terms do not exist with God. The creation of the universe is not the best God can do, the stone which God can create won't be the heaviest he can create, the power which God uses to lift the stone would never be the most powerful. There is nothing God can do which would make him the best, it is impossible for God to reach the best, because human beings operate with a ceiling of limitation, once the ceiling is reached, we have reached our best no matter how high that ceiling is, it is still limitation, but God operates without that ceiling of limitation, thus, God can never be the best, and God can create a stone so heavy, but he can still lift it, with reasons mentioned above.
