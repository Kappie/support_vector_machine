If I could find that heina and that  pepito  that she's found,  well I'd pop a cap in  pepito  and I'd slap her down.   What I really wanna know,  my baby, what I really want to say I can't define.  Well it's love,  that I need, oh ,  but my soul will have to,  wait till I get back and find heina of my own.  Daddy's gonna love one and all.   I feel the break,  feel the break,  feel the break and I got to live it up,  oh, yea huh, well I swear that I.  What I really wanna know, baby,  what I really want to say I can't define.  that love make it go,  my soul will have to...   What I really wanna say,  my baby,  What I really wanna say is I've got mine.  and I'll make it, Yes, I'm comin' up.   Tell  pepito  that if he knows what is good for him he best go run and hide.  Daddy's got a new .45.  and I won't think twice to stick that barrel straight down  pepe's  throat.  Believe me when I say that I got somethin for his punk ass.  What I really wanna know, my baby,  what I really wanna say is there's just one,  way back,  and I'll make it, yea,  but my soul will have to wait.  yea, yea, yea
