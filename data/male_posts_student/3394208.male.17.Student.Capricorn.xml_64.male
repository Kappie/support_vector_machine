Yo I'll buy girl a drink But girls got to pay On the front porch I got Some iced tea If you like a taste of tea Then come along with me It's martini time Yeah yeah feeling golden Bring your own beverage Just make sure it's cold I like cold beverage Give me a frosty mug Filled with A If you got ice cream Make it a double scoop Milkshade at the fountain Really good sounding Chocolate egg cream Yo, I'm champ cherry pounding Caught a chill vibe Orange juice in my ride Wawa's to the right They got a beverage inside Dig me a hot coffee Fill it up with ice Watermelons like drink Please fix me a large slice Summertime is cool the heat is getting old Yeah I'll get a beverage Just make sure it's cold cold I like cold beverage When I'm fishing Let's keep one thing clear The baits over there The brews right here Two six packs and a big bag of ice Didn't even catch a bite But the brew tasted nice Back to the bar Strawberry daiquiris and a colada I need a whole lotta them Fruit drinks to catch me a buzz I must tell you I'm the Cool Aid kid Before you serve my drink Please stick it in the fridge I like cold beverage
