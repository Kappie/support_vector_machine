The price ended up in the mid-hundreds with me paying half. Understandable.    Well, the worst is over. We had our big discussion about my hiking/camping experience yesterday. My mom wheedled me into camping for 10 days instead of 14. No big. My dad seemed more supportive of the idea, as he is a heavy outdoorsman himself. It should be fun.    I may or may not be breaking up with my girlfriend. Who knows? She posted on her blog that she feels I was mean and nonunderstanding. I replied today with an email and shall read the reply after I'm done camping. We'll both have plenty of time to think.
