She asks "are you sure?" five damn times before it sinks in that in fact we are perfectly fine. we have been raised basically to take care of ourselves since my mom is the only parent and is either working or partying with her young female friends. she has a boyfriend also and that takes up a lot of her time also. but as long as we are fed we dont mind it much. oh well here are some recents thoughts ive had: 1. i think i can run for president and win, ive already got three votes behind me. ill be damned if i let sprint win.  2. went to dairy queen and got fat eating the most chocolate thing they had...going there reminded me of this pick up line "ill be your burgerking if youll be my dairy queen"...something like that. 3. im pretty sure sprint spelled eunich wrong, also got kicked in the nuts...tough break man that sucks.  4. idk what im going to do for college got some sketchy plans, i just want to stay near friends and if things work out its gonna be fanfuggingtastic going college. im guessing thats because i lack the ability to go out and meet people. this is why i have few friends lol but hey im not complaining. i think my friends are pretty outstanding characters. i doubt im going to go to umkc, they only accept 100 students and tuition for what am thinking of becoming is a quarter million.  5. i realized that looking back at "falling in love" with ash, i was a nutter. i cant believe i said some of the things i did. i admit to being over zealous and should have definately restrained my emotions and listened to my friends. i have a quote from a song by pedro the lion called rejoice "wouldnt it be great if everything was meaningless, but everything is so meaningful. and most everything turns to shit" i feel i tried to hard and missed the real point in being in a relationship. i realized that my constant worrying and flirting with jealousy wasnt a happy time. i am happier when there is real stress and i can see why ash is so reluctant to get into these things. so from now on i resolve to be laid back and calm. i feel incredibly stupid for acting how i did back then.  6. harry potter is fugging awesome. ive been reading that fifth book and im almost done. i had forgotten how good the books were, i suggest reading the last three cuz those were the best. the story grips you from start to finish and i totally forgot how good the prisoner of azkaban book was. i totally wanna see the movie and see all those dementors and see the boggart and all the nerdy stuff.  7. reading the book for most of the day...got a major headache and eyes hurts for a long time. glad im almost done.  8. dick, cock, faggot, cunt, and tits sounds really vulgar and gross words. i really dont like hearing them and saying them makes me wanna wash my mouth out with soap. but hey maybe im just being childish calling tits "boobs" or dick "penis". maybe cock is a mature word..idk i just dont like them. and the way the word faggot is used today pisses me off, its a disgusting word and being called it many a time from assholes i hate that word with a passion.  9. these are some people i wish didnt exist: ....um maybe i shouldnt put them up cuz ill be in for a beating and with some of the people i was gonna put on..prolly a stabbing. for that reason im not going to any carnival or wok and roll for a while. 10. i thoroughly dislike bastards who sue people and corporations for their own stupidity. fugging coffee is a given HOT LIQUID you cant live for what 50 years and not get the notion of coffee not being hot. and idk if i become president ill get rid of the a**holes who let these retards win so vote for me 20 years from now and my name is on that ballot. 11. went to the beach and was kickin it on the body board, decided to be cool and ride on my back. felt like a dumba** later and shouldn't have done it in the first place. i also get a rash under my armpit that lasts for just a couple of hours. no idea how i get them unless from rubbing but really.....i have no clue 12. head sometimes gets really itchy, i am concerned bout lice and some sea critters that can do that sort of stuff to ya.  13. im hoping i did well on the ACT, national average something like 20 or 22. im gunning for about 28-36. dont know if its going to happen because i saw the percentage of corrections to get write and im pretty sure i didnt come to par with them. 14. now that sprint has horses i looke forward to riding them and becoming an asian cowboy. ill start to learn cowboy lingo, give myself a drawl and put r's where they shouldnt be like "idears". i hear "idears" a lot and i think its pretty cool.   well those were my idears or thoughts or whatever see yer later
