Strangely, I got into it and wrote a good intro that allowed me to get a feel for what I wanted the story to be, the setting, and the main character.  It's been fun.  The working title is "Pumps," but depending on where the story goes, that could change.  I'd almost forgotten how much fun writing is, especially since the only writing I've done within the last year has been for school or in script format.  Scripting is fun, but doesn't allow for quite as much creativity as narrating.  Hopefully I'll find my niche in both this summer.  So Sunday is the start of the Leadership in Free Enterprise program at Baylor.  I'm underwhelmed, but that was expected.  I have no earthly idea what this program is about--besides the obvious free enterprise...and the leadership within it--so I wouldn't know what to get excited about if I tried.  Nevertheless, I'll be rooming with a stranger (most likely) for three nights and doing  something  for four days.  Mmm...intriguing.  As long as it's not the Final Solution, I think I'll be okay.  I called Sunthosh today, and he reminded me without saying so that I need to get my butt in gear, get a membership at the Y, and start working out with him and Mike.  I've been doing stuff around the house, but nothing serious.  Coupled with my new I-have-to-eat-everything-in-sight plan for the summer, the workout sessions should shape me into quite a different persona before the end of the summer.  No more Sickly Stickly for me!  Exciting stuff.  I also get my hair cut tomorrow.  Nothing momentous.  I only bring it up because I wish for one summer I could grow my hair out, as well as my beard and moustache that I have to fight to keep at bay.  Ever since joining the Young Marines, I've had to keep my hair under strict control (except for the four or five months during the 7th grade when I didn't show up for drill), so I don't even know what I look like with longer hair.  True, my hair doesn't actually get "long," per se, but it curls and grows into a bush (afro, in modern terms).  I guess I'm just tired of it looking the same way it has been since that HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE day back in junior high when I decided that the fade could come back and got a serious whack job done to my hair.    *shudders*  I want change, but I don't want it  that  much.
