I think maybe I have taken it for granted the fact that I can hit the bed and instantly fall into a slumber.   Discomfort is a massive head fuck.  I think that my threshold for comfort is so pathetic.  I hate being hot, I can't stand being itchy, and I feel like a fucking whiny brat half the time.  Guess I need to change that.    MiMi told me I was "obsessed" with my outer appearence this weekend.  I don't like to think of it as low self asteem - it's more of a constant dissatifaction with who I am.  I am always thinking of what I need to change to make myself work harder, be better, look hotter, and live longer.  Maybe I do take it to far, it's not that, maybe I talk about it to much.  There are those people that talk to much, my self included, and there are those people that  DO!   The wedding is not far off.  I am looking forward to a vacation, Mexico will be nice.  We bought some new snorkal gear, so I am ready for the reef.   I am also terrified - I have been dreaming of shark attacks - or just seeing a shark in the water is giving me nightmares at night. Last time we went snorkaling, I saw a baracuda - that freaked me out a little.   I am so facinated with nature that I think about it all the time - I just don't want to be eaten.    I'm sure there are lots of things in the world that feel that way - i.e. farm animals.
