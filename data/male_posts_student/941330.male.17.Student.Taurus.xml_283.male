's "soft hands" (as seen above). and newsweek calls itself a  reputed media outlet . allow me to shoot myself repeatedly in my groin region. or foot, whichever is higher. wait ... ah shit.   i hope the prospective voters of this country (all 24 of them) have already realized that the demos' whole buddy buddyappearance is the foundation of a calculated image overhaulwhich has no roots in a place i'd like to call honesty. please do not tell me it is mere coincidence that greedy lawyer/happy plant man edwardsswoops onto the ticket and suddenly al gore jr himself turns into some giggling lovey-dovey teletubby. and boy, isn't it great that they've become such a "good couple," as declared a gleeful john rupaul kerry? the newsweekstory even cites a statement from a bush aide agreeing that their families are photogenic. WHO GIVES A RAT'S FUCK. obviously i do, because i realize how important elizabeth edwards is in saving our country from terrorism.   furthermore, newsweek editor mark whitaker loudly berates the "predominantly (and expensively) negative [campaign], targeting people's fears of more terror than their hopes for a better future." all the while nonchalantly IGNORING  urlLink kerry's expensively negative campaign . what the hell gives newsweek the right to determine which "news" is worth telling to subscribers. oh, ANDTHEY COMPLAINABOUT THE "BUSH ECONOMY." the economy wobbled and eventually started to  urlLink tumble  during the end of the clinton presidency, which wasn't really clinton's OR bush's fault. alan greenspan just  urlLink raised  interest rates last week. 112,000 new jobs were added these last six months alone. bush fucking economy my ass.   haha this blog is now turning into my closed-minded weapon of 1337 propagandra p0w3r.   segwaying away from  urlLink frivolous lawsuit man  john edwards (sorry, best transition i could pull off), we have actual  urlLink frivolous lawsuits . not too much i will say about it, except that i don't think people sue about  urlLink not being class valedictorian  in  urlLink sudan  very much.
