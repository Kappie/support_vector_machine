Iraq is the devil so he says, and he has support for this as well strangely enough. apperently it's all because of terrorism, and because the inspectors can't find any evidence that they have any weapons of mass destruction that means Saddam  must  have them, what better proof that they have weapons then the utter lack of them. there's been talk that they want to use nuclear weapons, and of course the tree hugging hippy wannabes are against this. there's demonstrations and the like, but one thing that really caught my attention was some people bringing up a technique that was use when U.S. was going to nuke China all them long years ago, the protestors sent the president thousands upon thousands of little bags of rice saying  feed thy enemy . sure, it was a great way to show their point then when they had a resonable president, but now in the time of extra-super-sonic jets and tactical nuclear strikes and such, all of which are at the beck and call of a trigger happy texan, i don't really think they'll help. well maybe if you got enough of them and flew over him with a plane and threw them at him to knck him out then yes that could help, a little. and where does Canada stand on this issue? Canada's torn, between the fact that we're USA's bitch and that NATO is against the nuking and Canada has been on every peace keeping mission ever. of course i'm sure the government will make the right choice, or at least do whatever we're threatened to do. but whatever, if they're gonna go at it with nukes and shit at least it'll be a lght show that you'll never forget, or need to remember very long for that matter. -Matt
