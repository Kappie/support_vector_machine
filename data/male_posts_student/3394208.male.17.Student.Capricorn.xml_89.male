Newly formed shimmering from the sky up above    Look at what's growing within us    Wonders and dreams start overflowing    Stacks of unopened boxes waiting to be exposed    Chests unlocked waiting to be shared with the world    Don't throw them away plans and dreams    Pick up what was thought waste and recycle    Spill the pale of overflowing thoughts    Use the knowledge and build your ideas into reality    Our minds are not made to waste others    Create reality from your fantasies
