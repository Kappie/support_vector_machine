I believe I have reached a new level in stress from work when I'm now sitting here typing my thoughts like this, while some people reach "Nirvana" I have reached "Pathetica."   And not to get off the subject but what in the crap is up with people on AOL? Do I go messaging people with porn links to fake webcams with stupid names like "MeganLuvz298947469"? No. I don't. I swear to the Goddess the next fool that does that is going to get an earfull. I have a six speed shit filter and at the moment I require a nine.  Anyway.  What do I put here about my unetertaining "Pathetica" life? The fact I'm considering bankruptcy because I'm an idiot when I have a credit card? (Yes Mom, I should have listened to you, I know.) Or the fact that I really.. really.. really have begun to hate where I work. I used to think mainstream religion had the biggest bunch of hippocrites but this ambulance service I work for gives them a run for their money.  Speaking of bankruptcy whats up with the creditor calls? You know I have asthma medication to buy, cats to feed, a fiance' to buy bubble bath for.. if I haven't paid in the past four months and you're telling me my minimum payment is $700 and I only make $1000 in two weeks times three credit cards do you really think I'm going to pay you because you call every two hours? Screw that my phone has a volume control and I have a lawyer. I've learned my lesson, I'll suffer 7 years of poverty before I'm a rich doctor, then I'll laugh in your faces.. sort of like i'm doing now. Ha. Ha ha. Ha ha ha. Ha. Ha.
