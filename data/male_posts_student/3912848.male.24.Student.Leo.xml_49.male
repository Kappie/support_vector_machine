So I took up the challenge, the plan being to alternate books between the Old and New Testaments. I've often pondered why God arranged the beginning of the Bible as He did...one interesting book (Genesis) followed by about four of the most boring books in the entire Bible. Surely more than a few interested people have given up Bible-reading in despair, caught in the biblical Valley of Death?    I just finished Leviticus, which in my opinion is the most boring of all the boring Bible books. However, the reading was not without benefit. I've also been studying Jeremiah on Sunday mornings, and I happened on some intriguing connections between them.    Leviticus is the third book of the Pentateuch, and sets out most of the Law for the Israelites. Most of its chapters deal with ceremonial rituals and laws of personal relationship, along with health and sanitary rules, rules of warfare, and so on. For instance, the conditions for leprosy are spelled out exactly in Leviticus 13. If a man finds a bright white spot on his body, he must show it to the priest. If the hair has turned white and the mark appears deeper than the skin, it is leprosy, but if it appears otherwise, the priest shall isolate the man for up to 14 days, after which if the mark doesn't fit the definition of leprosy, the man shall be declared clean. If there is a boil on the skin, and the boil is white or reddish-white, the priest shall look at it...     It must've been exciting, to be a priest back in the old days. That is not, however, my point. At the end of Leviticus, in chapter 26, God tells them what will happen if they disobey Him and do not repent. Among other things, He promises that enemies will attack them and they will not be able to defend themselves. He promises that food will be short, and that indeed they will be forced to cannibalism of their own children. He assures them that, should they yet be unrepentant, He will scatter them abroad, and make their land desolate.     Now, to Jeremiah. Jeremiah was written a good many centuries after the giving of the Law. By the time the prophet Jeremiah wrote his book, Israel had been a nation for several hundred years, had split into two, and had (both parts) sunk deep into idolatry, with only ocassional lip-service to Yahweh God. And so God sent Jeremiah, along with many other prophets, to warn them to repent. Although by the time that Jeremiah was speaking, the chance for repentance had passed. He promised his listeners that the promises of God from Leviticus were about to come true.    What struck me, reading Leviticus, was how closely the pre-Exilic and Exilic writings parallel what Leviticus promised, among them Jeremiah. God promised that the people---as a nation---would be destroyed, and they were. He said they'd be scattered among the nations, and they were. He said the land would enjoy its sabbath rest (they were supposed to let the fields rest every seven years, which they never did), and it did (because there was no one, or few people, left to farm it). God made specific promises of what would happen, conditional on other things happening (the Israelites' constant, unrepenting sin), and those things did in fact happen.    I'm trying to avoid posting very long entries, a common occurrence given that I am somewhat long-winded. So I shall post part two of this tomorrow, which is a consideration of the parallels, if any, between ancient Israel and America.
