I know all of my readers must find the existence of girls who would turn me down as a logical impossibility, but trust me, they’re out there.   I’d also like to add that I am equally perplexed by their existence as well.  Back to my point...  When I reflect on my numerous dating relationships, none of them really irks me like my memory of Christy Glasow.  Christy was the girl I always had a crush on in high school.  After years of trying to get a date with her, she finally does.   But then , on the night of the big date, she stood me up!  I never got to go on a date with her.  I heard she started dating some older guy, and I never heard from her again.  To this day, that memory evokes stronger feelings than any other.  Stuff like this sticks for years.  For crying out loud, I’ve been carrying this one around for about six years!  The funny thing is that I can’t tell you the names of the last three girls whom I dated for almost a year each without thinking hard.
