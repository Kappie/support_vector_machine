"Son, I have just passed on a sweet legacy to you"    - My Dad, Uday K. Nulkar, after I was diagnosed with IDDM    Preface   As I await the results of yet another quarterly  urlLink Hemoglobin A1C  test (or the glycosylated hemoglobin), and a few others next week, my mind is rewinding itself to the events that occured a year ago. Come December 31, 2003 and it would be my first Diabetes Anniversary. Life has absolutely zipped by since December 31, 2002. At times, days and nights have seemed long, but a year seems way too short.  "It was all happening..." , to quote Bill Lawry's Aussie drawl on Channel Nine.  Feels tremendous to be alive and kicking, and I am looking forward to another year to zip by just the same. After my second A1C test at the beginning of the Fall of 2003, Dr. Russell Risma at CSU's  urlLink Hartshorn Health Center  looked at me with a smiling approval and asked,  "Atul, are you sure you are a diabetic?" . As much as that was friendly banter, I wish I could have responded with a pompous proclamation of a  "No" . Pausing briefly, he added in his characterstic humorous tone:  "I am not sure if my own A1C level is as good as that" . That, simply put, was the final seal of approval.  Whether they are academic grades or results for diabetes lab tests, I still seem to experience the same feeling of trepidation, even though at the same time, I feel confident about my third A1C being just as good as the first two. Ofcourse, there are a bunch of other tests to pass - like the  urlLink lipid profile , and a couple others to do with the kidney and the thyroid. There's no reason why the butterfly-shaped glands or the bean-shaped organs should be a source of worry, but a bit anxious I am, anyhow. My eyes have a different story to tell though, as a slight blurry vision suggests that I might have to adorn myself with a thicker pair of lenses. Or maybe thinner, if optimism sounds better.  I woke up today, and I hated to see a new day dawn. Might seem unusual for a morning person who likes to catch a glimpse of the first rays of the soothing Colorado sun in these bitter cold days of winter. I hated to do the daily morning routine. The chore, which starts with a big yawn that welcomes the new day, followed by the gradual slipping-out-of-the-bed thing, trudging towards the bathroom to brush and pee, and then getting back besides the bed only to thrust that seemingly godforsaken insulin pen inside my belly. I have done that for about 340-odd days every morning, now. And I just could not prepare myself to inject today, although eventually sanity prevailed, and I did inject. Over these 340-odd days, taking shots twice a day has been literally a routine,  and I mean , "a routine". Initially it used to be:  "Hi there, I am taking a shot for my diabetes" . Slowly but surely it changed to:  "Hi there, I am taking a shot" . It was similar to any other daily chore such as brushing your teeth. Today was a bit different. I had a fleeting glimpse of frustration and depression getting the better of me. If its fairly easy to get into that so-called routine, its even more easy to loose the grip on it. This was followed by visions of me devouring candy bars and chocolates one night, when it was time for the cravings to get the better of me. Yes, that actually did happen sometime last summer, only to find my fasting glucose levels in the morning sky-rocketing. I still have a hearty laugh when I recollect those desperate moments.   I tried to overcome my frustration by letting myself know of the good work that I had been doing all these months. My mind wasn't ready yet. "Yes, but can I continue doing the good work for say, 10 or 20 more years down the road?". I imagined myself going through that same godforsaken routine for the next 20 years, and I laughed again.   Maybe I should just stop worrying about my future worries.    ~ The End of the Chronicles Series ~
