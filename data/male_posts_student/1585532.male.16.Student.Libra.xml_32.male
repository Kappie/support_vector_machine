Hopefully you all didn't think I just keeled over without telling you guys, because I'm not like that.  Anyways, after much Halloween effort, that paid off nicely.  Now It's all in my room.  My music playing all the time and my scary room, yup.  Well, I think I'm in the boring part of the year now.  Why you ask?  Well, let's see.  Its cold, its windy, and its boring.  But hopefully I'll survive...somehow.  Seems like after Halloween the fun rating just drops doesn't it?  Well, I'm going to go find some decent soup, because the last soup I had sucked.  Ta.
