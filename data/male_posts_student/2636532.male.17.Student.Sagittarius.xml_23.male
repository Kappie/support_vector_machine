Well i finally got around to seeing this supposed great movie "The Ring", i tell you something it was such a let down that i almost cried that wasted $6.50 to go see it.  all it freaking is is a movie about a video that kills you if you don't copy it and pass it on.  seriously, is hollywood running out of ideas that they have to write a "horror" film about a chain letter??  what's next? a movie about a cursed apple juice box that if you don't kick it 13 times your underwear will never fit right again?? mmmmmmmm apple juice. really i think more ppl should drink apple juice i think we should have apple juice fountains. can you tell i like apple juice? i really hate chain letter...i don't see what kind of person could fall for that kind of bullshit? how is sending an electronic mail going to, in any way shape or form, affect your love life, sex life, luck, or any other aspect of your life? i hate to break it to some of you chain letter fanatics out there, but they don't work. from all the ones i HAVEN'T sent i should have died in a plane crash twice, had 7 heart attacks, been killed in 3 car accidents, all my family and friends should be dead 4 times over, i'd have 278 years of bad luck, 56 years of bad sex, my crush will go for my best friend 3 times, and i should've also been beaten to death by a rabid monkey.  i don't know about you guys but i think a rabid monkey would have a hard time getting to canada. maybe i'll make up my own chain letter. i think i will. watch out it'll come to a town near YOU! -Matt
