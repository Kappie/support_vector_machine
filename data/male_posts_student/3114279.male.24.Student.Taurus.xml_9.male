      So this is the first post by me, Glenn Shaheen. Man, this is kind of like a job interview or something. I have to be really funny or people are going to say "That Glenn, I don't like his posts. He gots no wit." Well. I just hope I don't spel anything wrong. Oh, damn! That should be spell anything incorrectly! I'm so screwed. But I have to give props to Nick for showing me this thing.  Do we get emo points for having a weblog? I hope not. Next thing you know I'll be listening to Jimmy Eat World and snobbing my way through Jim Morrison's poetry book. I'll start pretending I'll never get old, and that MTV bands really suck, even though my entire cd collection will be on heavy rotation. I'm so bitter. I once liked a girl who ended up liking some guy in a band with influences including "AFI, Our Lady Peace, and Dashboard Confessional," although they're really original, she swears. I just want to know when the jocks took back rock and roll. They had it in the 80s with hair metal, but the losers took it back briefly in the early 90s for grunge. Now all this noise. I guess I have to live with the fact that I'll never be in a band because I don't work out three times a day and don't look like I should be in a CK ad. But c'est la vie, au jour d'hui, at least.  I am happy Easter is here, though. It has the best candy of any holiday. Hooray for dying Jesus! I think I'd even see the Jesus Chainsaw Massacre again if I got a couple of free cadbury creme eggs out of the deal.  Nick always has quotes on his, so I guess I'll dig one out of "A Far Rockaway of the Heart," a book of poems by Lawrence Ferlenghetti. "So rent a museum     and see yourself in mirrors--  In every room an exposition  of a different phase in your life  with all your figures and faces and pictures of all the people who passed through you and all the scenes you passed through all the landscapes of living and longing and desiring and spending and getting and doing and dying and sighing and laughing and crying."  I really had to stop myself from putting the whole thing in. Damn good book.
