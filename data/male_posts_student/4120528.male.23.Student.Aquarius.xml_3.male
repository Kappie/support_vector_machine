Lets see Tuesday was the day that my family and I went out to New York to drop off our stuff at a cousins house then went right into the city to a viewing.  Which was the first time in a long time that I saw any family.  It was ok.  Not much can be said about a viewing.  Then on wendsday we had the funeral.  Yea that was a funeral and of course after the funeral was the burial.  I was amost shocked that I really didnt cry through the whole ordeal.  It wasnt until I got to the grave of my fathers parents that I really cried.  They passed away when I was only about 1.  I dont know maybe the idea that I never met them and that I lost what could have been there.  I dont know.  After that we all got back in the cars and went back to my cousins and packed to come home.       Thursday I drove back to my apt.  It was really freaking rainning so it was a little bit of a trek.  But I got home ok.  So I got home and make a desion to unblock leanne from my list.   Which soon got a response.  I told her to call me and talk.  I finally got to tell her that things where finally over between the two of us.  Surpriseingly she took it better then I could have hoped for.  It wasnt pretty but she took it better then I though.  We where on the phone for about an hour and a half.  She had to go due to haveing to drive for 8 hours the next day for New York.  I didnt hear anything from here till tonight which I though was a big surprise.  I figured she would have called before today.  She said that she wanted to talk more and I was just like, O god.  So I know that another call will happen shortly.  Then after we got off the phone feeling shitty and numb.  I left and went to talk to one of my really good friends.  That helped a good bit.  For some reason I feel better after talking to them.  So I left there fairly late.      Friday I had work and got back to the swing of things.  At least it was good to see some things will not change.  I got a good deal of stuff done and so on and so forth.  Friday was also the same night that two of my other friends were having a party.  So I had two parties to go and then I found out that my one friend had a really wierd/bad day.  So I went over there and talked with them till about 11:30.  From there I went out to the party at my friend/coworkers party.  It was interesting.  I got to follow/chase my one friend because he was a good bit inebriated.  So during the night I was drinking something called absinthe. Check here for more details on absinthe.   urlLink http://brewery.org/library/absfaq.html  Most of my friends didnt like it but I though it was pretty good.  While all of this is going on Kill Bill vol I and II are playing.  So that just adds to things.  So about 3:30am I decide to head out of the party due to most of the people are now asleep.  So I go to my other friends party.  It still had some people sturring around so it was cool.  I got to see my one friend nick  urlLink http://www.gliscameria.blogspot.com/  who is now living in Phoenix Arizona.  So that was really cool to see him again.  So what is he doing when I get there he is playing Madden 2005.  That was wierd but ok.  At one point all I see is a girl wareing nothing but a towel run by.  So that was cool.  aka She was HOT.  So I left there about 5 ish to head home.  The best part of all this is that I have work at 6:30 the next morning.  So I get about a 40 min nap before I have to be at work.      Saturday was like a wierd half lack of sleep induced dream.  I was really out of it for most of the day.  I actually found myself waking from falling alseep while standing.  That was trippy.  So when I got home I went to bed.  I was like ok I will set my alarm for about 7 pm (I went to bed around 4ish) so if I wanted to do something I could.  So yea that didnt happen. I got out of bed around 9 thinking it was like 9 am so I am like ok I have about an hour before I have to be at work.  So that is cool.  I go to put my head back down for about another 10 mins.  I then get up again.  Walk out into the kitchen and see it is still dark out.  Thinking god you are such a schmuck.  So I am up at 9 pm so what else is there to do I watch tv till about 1 then go to bed again.  So I can get up for work at 10 on Sunday morning.      Sunday was another day of work and then I come home and get a good hot shower and feel better.  I think I went out to visit my friend again to see how they where doing and to talk about things.  It went fairly well.  After which I cam home and went to bed for work at 12 monday morning was quickly going to approach.  That leads into today.       Monday which was today now yesterday.  I had work and that was work what else do I have to say.  I got home and then went out to shoot some pool with my other friend mike.  That was cool.  So here I am now home from shooting pool and hungry (I have ramen cooking.)  it is about 3 am and I have work tomarrow at 8 so I think I am about out of material to write about.  So g'night everyone.  I didnt get to see my other good friend but I will hopefully get to see them tomarrow.
