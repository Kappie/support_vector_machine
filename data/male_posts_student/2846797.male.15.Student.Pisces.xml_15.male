Finally after a week and a half of doing nothing in Geometry he might actually teach us something tommrow. Song of the week is Sleepyhead by Alkaline Trio on their album "Maybe I'll Catch Fire". Movie I have been watching this week is Phoneboth with Coline Farrel(i think thats how you spell it). Quite a cool movie. Another day another post closer to Spring Break just 2 more days and one of them is a short day so, Yay! Well bye bye.
