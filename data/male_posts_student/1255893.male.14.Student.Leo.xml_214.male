I was playing Agent Under Fire today... and I got to the last level, but I got frustrated and turned off the game. Problem was.. I didn't save it =P Wow... and I had just gotten past the snipers too. Oh well. Ive beaten it before anywayz.   Crap. Im cold. *shiver*. well... since no one's gonna come and help keep me warm, I guess Ill just go get in bed. Nighty night everyone.
