"What's Brandon Reading" Episode III   Book   Star Wars: Specter of the Past  By: Timothy Zahn     Story: Specter of the Past is the first of a new series, The Hand of Thrawn. Princess Leia is trying desperately to hold the loose coalition of interests known as the New Republic together long enough to see the evil Empire finally vanquished. But in a stunning setback, Han Solo and Luke Skywalker discover that the pirate ships raiding New Republic transports are staffed with clones under the command of someone who claims to be Grand Admiral Thrawn, the Empire's most powerful warlord, believed dead for 10 years. Thrawn's plan for destroying the fragile New Republic seems well on the way to completion--unless Han, Leia, and Luke can stop it.  Squeak says: Just started this puppy. I loved the first (original) Thrawn Trilogy, so this will probably be just as good.    Comic Book   Identity Crisis #2 , DC Comics     Story: More fun stuff from New York Times bestselling author Brad Metzler. The DC Universe gets shaken to its very core!  Squeak says: I loved #1. It was probably the best comic book of the summer. Although at first, I didn't realy care about who died in the first issue, Metzler made me by the end of the issue. Haven't read this issue yet, but I'm about to sit down and read it.
