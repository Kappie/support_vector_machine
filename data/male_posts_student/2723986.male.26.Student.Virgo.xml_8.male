About noon I rushed over to the bank so I could deposit a check before it closed to get some cash.  The purpose of this was to get a V-Day gift for Rebecca.  Because she is such a big time chocolate lover (though you’d never guess with her Barbie-like physique) I opted on the box of assorted chocolates in the traditional heart-shaped box.  Later on, after I got home, she paid me a surprise visit and discovered the chocolates lying on my bed.  Ooops!  It turned out ok in the end, because she was so thrilled to be surprised by the box of chocolates on V-Day, even if I didn’t “officially” give them to her.    For our date we originally planed to go down to a Japanese restaurant in Portland, but as it turned out the one we had in mind was small and very packed.  Deciding against the potential long wait, we headed over to the movie theater with the hopes of seeing “50 First Dates” with Adam Sandler.  Unfortunately, we were foiled again.  Because we showed up 10 minutes before the showing, only front row seating was available.  Not wanting to wait to for the next showing which was a good 2 hours away, we decided to head on over to Hollywood Video to pick up a rental.  We came to a mutual agreement on “X2: X-Men United” (great movie BTW) and headed back over to my pad for the duration of the evening.  So now I’m busy studying for my two tests on Tuesday (thank goodness that Monday is a holiday!).  It’ll be my first test for Unix and second Calculus exam.  My goal with the Calculus test is beat my last score of 78%.  I’m pretty confident I can do it – I’ll post the results for both here as I get them.  Other than that no big plans this weekend.  I would like to beat  Beyond Good  Evil  and  Viewtiful Joe  over the next week or so, so I’ll try and chip away them during my study breaks.
