I have done some research on the gnomes by acting as part of their society but naturally(with me in a gnome suit)i didnt fit in so they tar and feathered me till i had boils the size of popcorn bags that eventually sprouted wings and flew to the sea where they laid there little mocassin eggs. But enough about that. I have some interesting facts you might not know about the underpants gnomes,they are very friendly, just so long as you dont surprise them and they arent harmful at all, they just want to build their castle to repel the dreaded attack of the woe kitten and the space marmot. The woe kitten and the space marmot are very afraid of humans and no nhuman has ever encountered them but they are the natural enemies of the underpants gnomes so everything will end in a terrible war with under-nukes and marmilade if they dont get enough underpants so please if you ever see a gnome... put underpants on his head and kick him.
