Writed some stuff on tutorialforums.com on the debate forum. Hope to get some intelligent replies.    Wanderley  had a problem with his work. His floppy was corrupted. Everything is fine now.   Feel like playing  chrono cross  with an emu. Reminds me i still have those two 700Mo + images of the game cds.  Regards,  Zephyr
