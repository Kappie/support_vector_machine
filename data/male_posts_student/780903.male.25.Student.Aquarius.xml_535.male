Also sorry that East Coast radio stations appear to be obsessed with the Kelly Clarkson song, "Miss Independent."  But at least that gives me a song to parody.  Sort of.  The title here is better than my parody.  "Missin' Defendant" (To the tune of "Miss Independent")  (Verse 1) Missin' defendant Frustrated lawyer Summary judgment, mmm  Plaintiffs allege A crime on the street And missin' defendant arrested  Evidence shows Maybe unclear But lawyer can't do much if the client don't show  So, there he sits down at the table Defendant don't answer her cell phone Little miss plaintiff's lawyer Says ooh, declare this done  (Chorus) What is the judge going to do? Where is defendant, where can she be Why all your clients never show up This ain't the first missin' defendant; maybe your lawyering's not effective Going to jail, and lawyer you fail  (Verse 2) Out on the street Violates bail Missin' defendant won't show up but police are out on her tail  But she miscalculated She didn't wanna end up incarcerated But this missin' defendant will end up in jail  But by showing you she didn't want you She went in a new legal direction And you've been fired, you've lost one more client You've been disbarred  (Chorus) What is the judge going to do? Where is defendant, where can she be Why all your clients never show up This ain't the first missin' defendant; maybe your lawyering's not effective Going to jail, and lawyer you fail   Also: an interesting article in this weekend's NY Times magazine about  urlLink Baby Names .  Not relevant to anything at all, but just kind of interesting, if you're bored.
