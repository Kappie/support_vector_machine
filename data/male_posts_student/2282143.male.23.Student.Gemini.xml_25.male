Today is an angry day.  Ive experienced many things that irritated me beyond control today.  First off, lets take the US postal service in La Grange.  I stand in line for a good 5 minutes so I can mail two of my bills.  I just need stamps.  The lady working at the desk, Jean, proceeds to look at me like I just shot her fucking dog, and says "you only need stamps?"  YES!  Im too damn cheap to buy a whole book of them when I only need two.  Who cares?  Apparently Jean does.  I would just like to apologize for taking 30 seconds of your otherwise meaningless life away from you.  Happy Holidays, Jean.  Next, driving to COD, on 88 the left lane closes due to some construction.  So, being aware of this fact, when I see the sign, I move into the right lane as soon as I possibly can, because, duh, the lane is going to end in 1000 feet.  However, not everyone has my sense of logic.  Many cars zoom past me on the left, driving all the way to the point where the lane starts moving over.  Then they proceed to cut off anyone who happens to be next to them at the time the lane ends.  This causes the people in my lane to slam on their brakes to avoid an accident, stopping the flow of traffic in my lane.  Am I being selfish?  Does this not make sense?  Are you in that big of a fucking rush that you cant get over when you see the sign, and then we can all drive happily past the construction?  I say from now on, if you are within 50 feet of the lane ending, you're fucked.  You had your opportunity to get over.  Sit and wait until there is a break in traffic or some kindhearted person who isnt pissed off at your driving is nice enough to maybe let you past.  Im not 100% sure, but legally, we people who know how to drive and have already moved over a lane have the right of way, and if you merge into us, you're at fault.  I might do that some time.  Might get a nice, new car out of the deal.    In the library, there was a girl who was loud as hell on her cell phone.  I almost went over to her, slapped her, and throw her cell phone out the window.  Im glad I wasnt feeling  that  angry today.  She is probably glad for that too.  It's a library.  People study.  Its supposed to be relatively quiet.  Slut...  On my way home, I noticed yet another thing.  People dont use their turn signals... Especially on the expressway.  When you are going 75+ mph, is it good to just move in front of someone without giving them at least 2 blinks notice?  I havent quite finished the course on mind control and telepathy, so if you could please let your intentions be known to me?  I'd hate to die in a car wreck because some asshole couldnt move his wrist three inches.  And if I do, he damn well better have a broken wrist from whacking it too much.  Common courtesy everyone.  THINK.  PLEASE.  For my sanity as well as others.   Now off to TKD to blow some steam and hopefully not be so angry.  Also, Im kinda angry at myself because I accidentally kicked a kid in the stomach on Monday.  Full story when I get home possibly.    DO THIS:  Go to Google and type in "miserable failure" then press "Im feeling lucky..."  Its the funniest thing I have ever seen.  It made my night!  Peace.
