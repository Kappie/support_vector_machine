For those of you who aren't familiar with the specifics of this contest, let me fill you in. Eight hitters are chosen from Major League Baseball, 4 from the National League and 4 from the American League. Each batter gets to hit, and gets 10 "outs"; anything other than a home run is considered an out. If the player doesn't swing the bat, the pitch doesn't count. There are three rounds, with 4 people eliminated after the first, 2 in the second, and then one batter is left the champion. That's it.   Miguel Tejada (Orioles) surprised many people by winning, hitting a total of 27 home runs in Houston's Minute Maid Park. He also hit the longest home run, at 497 feet. (Dead center is only 435 feet.)  I thought Lance Berkman (Astros) would win; it's his home park, after all, and he's a monster at the plate. Well, he didn't disappoint me, making it into the final round and finishing with 21 home runs and the second longest at 493 feet.   However, let's look at some of the others: Sammy Sosa (Cubs) hit 5, and didn't escape the first round. Barry Bonds (Giants) hit 11, and didn't get out of round 2. Jim Thome (Phillies), the current Major League home run leader with 28 home runs, only hit 4 and never left round one.  The good news is, that this means nothing. It's simply surprising. They're not hurt, and this contest doesn't impact anything for the season or their teams. It's just surprising that three guys with that much power and ability hit a combined total of 20 home runs, with a LOT less pressure than is on them during a normal game.   Ah well, that's part of what makes baseball such a fun sport.
