Although I did get to miss a part of it because the silly girl forgot to change the batteries in her digital camera, so I went to work and got her some more. The banquet was good though. I got to see a lot of people that I know, either from going to school there (which isn't many), or from youth group related functions (which is a few). The music sucked at the dance afterwards, so Crystal decided to leave. We had a pretty good talk in the car I think, about where our lives are at these days, what we're feeling. It almost seems like she's relieved to finally have me over her. Well. Yay us.  Karin was supposed to come out and play on Saturday night, but she wasn't allowed. I don't quite understand her parents. If my kid was leaving for some far away place, I would ecourage them to go out and have a good time before they left, not try and keep them in the house. But that's just me, perhaps I'm just a little off in that way. So what did I do Saturday night...I don't remember. Oh yeah, I remember. Bryce and I boycotted the bar and played Street Fighter all night.  Sunday. Meh. Went to work. Got off work. Came home. Bryce called. Went downtown with him and Jamie and Amber. Sylvan was too crowded, so we went to uhm...The Blarney Stone, then to Branleys. Woke up at 9 with the worst hang over I've ever had. Went to work.  Blah blah blah.  Last night, went to Gull Lake with Karin and Sonja and some of their friends. It was a good time. Short, but good. Then to the bars. I wasn't really in the mood for the bars, and I'm sure it kinda showed, but that's alright. Ha. I had written that sentence, and not more than 20 seconds later, Crystal told me I looked sad last night...so yeah, I guess it did show. Meh.   Canada Day. Let's go thrust ourselves into a drunken stupor and stumble around downtown! YAY for resort towns!
