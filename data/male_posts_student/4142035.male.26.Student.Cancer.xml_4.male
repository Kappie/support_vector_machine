After about 200 throws of the ball, finally, she plops down for a breather.  After a five minute nap, she's rearing to go again.  Meanwhile, I got a new case rotator cuff tendinitis.  She eats like twice a day!  If I ate twice a day, I'd just barely have enough energy to watch the ball go flying away and then to go back to sleep.  "Huh?  You threw it.  You get it."
