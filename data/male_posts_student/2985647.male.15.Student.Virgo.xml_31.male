     
      A travelling salesman knocks on the door of a house. A kid, about 12 years old, answers the door. He's wearing a pink tutu, has a cigar in one hand, and a martini in the other.  The salesman is a little taken back, so he asks,  'Excuse me, son, are your parents home?'  The kid takes a big puff on the cigar and answers, 'What the f*** do you think?'
