It's like I'm a radio or something, recieving all of their emotions and retransmitting.  This can be easily seen in history class.  Any mood I was in changed while being around Kaylee, who's been silent recently.  My mood just dropped to depressed.  Then she left early, and being around others who were chipper changed my mood again.  -  Odd, my posts are usually longer.  I'll have to follow up later.
