You all thought u got lucky, never havin' to see ME again...well go back to pullin' out your lashes, and recount your lucky stars, 'cause I'm frickin' back.  Risen from the dead, my computer's back on track, after like 3 weeks of shit it gave me, and 4 days of shit I gave it to fuckin' fix it. So far, its been 'round 3 comps fixed: Hyperspaz's first, then mine, and then Dollface's; the girls havin' had their comps upgraded to XP. Thanx to Conrad, and my help, Hyper's comp was restored to..better condition (it better be) after that assholian virus she posted about that thoroughly raped her comp. Mine was too thoroughly violated up the out-hole, and had to be checked into rehab, and Dollface was tired of her comp's crap and decided to give it a full facelift. I think Conrad needed to fix his up too, dunno how that went.  'Sides all this shit, I come back and the blog's all purty and fancy-lookin' and shit. In a few days (I hope) I will have finally gotten around to making the new face for the new home of this weblog, for all you bitches to enjoy. In the meanwhile, keep dreamin', I'll never be gone!  I'm the Zenman, and no school proxy's gonna see this shit.  "Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck"
