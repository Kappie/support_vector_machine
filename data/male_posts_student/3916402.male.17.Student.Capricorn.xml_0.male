As a member of the group known as Fort Worth Via Media, I was "in on" sending a letter of concern to Bishop Iker, who is a member of the American Anglican Council.    While many of us were not expecting any response, I expected the response to have answers if it was ever sent.  Bishop Iker sent a response, and the response, the whole paragraph of it, was nothing but him playing with words, and answering no questions.  I was shocked he even replied, and disappointed that the man couldn't even have the courtesy of answering straight-forwardly the questions asked of him.  After that response, a friend of mine in the diocese of For Worth wrote him a letter.  The letter spoke about authority of scripture, Bishop Gene Robinson and his consecration, and the issue of divorce.  The jist was "Bishop Iker, if you are so in favor of the authority of scripture why is it that you condemn the consecration of an openly gay man to the episcopate, based on scriptural underandings, and have no real problem with divorce which Christ Himself spoke against?"    Bishop Iker wrote back.  The sentence reply was nothing short or more than: "I am growing weary of your constant prodding.  Please put your time to better use. +JLI"  The arrogance, and utter causticness of his reply makes my stomach turn.  The man could not answer a simple question.  The man, who is supposed to have a form of pastoral authority, showed no pastoral care or concern what-so-ever.    "Dear God! Dear God!  Why have you forsaken me?" is what I want to scream aloud - but I all I must remember is that Christ told us that we would suffer as His servants.  Although I am not suffering like so many other Christians - I am still suffering injustice.  I cannot even recieve attiquite pastoral care for it honest and simple questions are seen as "prodding."
