Craziest thing was when bryndan almost killed himself on the four wheeler, he was going really fast when he nailed a tree and grabbed a branch on the way through the air that managed to keep him from landing head first, still some pretty rough injuries though. he was about due for an accident, it had been over 2 months lol. it was good to see everybody from overthere! they are all fun and really nice (even though bryndan and some of them hadsome skirmishes while we were there lol). it was still fun! they will all be heading off to college though, i kinda wish i was doing that too but o well only 1 more year! o hope everyone is doing great back in jackson and that everyone headed to junaluska has a great time there! hopefully i will get to see yall b4 i head out again to tulsa. bye 4 now, time to eat monkey bread, yummmm!
