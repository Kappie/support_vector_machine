James Doohan, affectionately known as "Scotty" by  Star Trek  fans, has been diagnosed with Alzheimers.  As it turns out, Mr. Doohan is a very interesting man.  Besides starring in  Star Trek , he was also an infantryman who was part of the D-Day attack on Normandy, where he was wounded.  It was while he was in the army that he learned the accent he used in  Trek .    According to the article,   In honor of Doohan, the theme of this year's "Star Trek" convention will be "Beam Me Up Scotty -- One Last Time,"
