However, i guess it could be a good poem...i just think it sucks... so here it is.  Just let me be alone, just for a second The darkness much better than the light As shadows fall across your face I see The face of evil trying to take Reality away from me. Please, Please Just let me be alone, I can't believe How could you be so mean to me? How could you try to pass it by As if I didn't notice. If I could I would change every thing about that day The way you had to lie and hide. The way I treated you like you were not my love But now I want to be alone. Just let Me be. Just let me be in loneliness. The pain inside has turned into my life. I really want to leave it all behind, The more I see your face, the more I want To be alone. Because it's all I have. It's all I have, my love just leave. I need To Be alone to think about where we Now stand. I see that time we spent is gone, And now I want to be in here alone.
