The day got busy.  People kept bailing from work, so we had no breakers for a good two hours.  Not bad for me cause I was on a 3-car and could switch driving/narrating, but poor Tanya was stuck on a 2-car and just had to keep circling.  Sucks.  Especially since I kinda feel the people who left had bullshit excuses.  Work ended up being really kinda busy after the rain let up.  I have Monday off, which can be a good thing or at least a relaxing day.  I found myself kinda dazed and confused all day.  Fragile, I guess.  Well, not really fragile, but not being strong on anything.  Ever have one of those days?  So Im not doing anything tonight either.  Just gonna lay low and relax.  A bit tired...  Maybe work out, but I just ate some Lucca's pizza.  Best stuff around LaGrange.  So maybe later.  Who knows.  Listening to the best 500 songs ever on Oldies 104.3.  Man, my night is just like my day, randomness.  Just one of those days I guess.    Also I do believe in the quarter life crisis.  I think this is a new phenomenon with our generation.  Perhaps it was in others, but I cant find anyone who says so.  Everyone I know is kinda fried right now with life and how much everything sucks and how nothing goes your way.  Either too much school or not enough.  Either finding a job right away and then deciding thats not what you want to do with your life, or those working temps or menial jobs passing the time until any of the above come along.  I think if this whole thing doesnt work out for me in the next few years, Im gonna travel.  See the country, possibly see the world.  Pipe dreams, I know, but a man can dream.  In the mean time, Im gonna stick to reality and keep working on a CNA job cause those bastards havent called me in yet.  If Im here Tuesday I think Im gonna go physically with my resume to these places.
