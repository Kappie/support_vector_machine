It can very easily be stolen and used by bad people for maniacal evil we cannot begin to comprehend. Or that's what the guy at 1-900-need-law said. Don't quote me on that. But really, IP is fragile and very easily stolen. I'm going to check some random expert sites to try and see what we need to do. From an article in  Game Developer Magazine  I gathered that the best way to protect IP is through a copyright. And to prevent the negligent chance I might flip you all off and run away with your ideas, It seems as though the best way to protect IP is to put it in the name of a company. Problem is, we don't have a company. Question is, How do we create a company? My dad says when he made his company (Paragon Marble and Tile) He had to file a stack of paperwork as tall as himself and shuck out a good deal of cash. He said most of that was an insurance deposit in case he screwed up someone's house. Making the business was the easy part. I need to check this out, but for now, we need contracts put in the name of the, oh I dunno, Sykes group, stating that you will not run away with Ã†GIS. Like that would happen. We also need to file a copyright and make friends with an attorney. Any help on this from anyone would be grand. I accept investments in the form of cash and check.
