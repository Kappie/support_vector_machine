I had a male bonding party last night. Me and two other manly games playing soccer video games and calling people gay. It was pretty fun.  Who knew that being homophobic could be so much fun. Along with soccer video games.  Yee haw! We saw Matrix: Reloaded on an IMAX. It was exactly the same only the bass would violate my butt.  Yea, that's about it. Love you all, and I won't see a ton of you before you go off to college so "Guden Lucken".
