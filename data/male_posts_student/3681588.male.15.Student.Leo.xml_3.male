The back-up UPS that we got installed just gives electricity to one part of my apartment (the living room, the office, the kitchen, the dinning room and one bathroom). This is because my dad is a Software Developer and he can't afford not having electricity in the office, so we just rigged the UPS to light this part and that way it won't run out of batteries quickly. Well, gotta go, watch some tv, and sleep in my HOT room :S...
