Anyway, boring crappy explanations aside.  Billie-Anne had her leaving party on Saturday. Within half an hour of being there I had already had one Export Gold and four shots of Tequila. Let's just say I got wasted. Now Billie-Anne has a photo of me posing while wearing her tight pink and black striped sweater and her frilly pink mini-skirt over my own clothes. Luckily, I refused to lie on the bed and pose like a porn star, because that would have been embarrassing (not that wearing her clothes isn't embarrassing).  On Sunday I went into work, still marginally drunk, and bought myself some hair dye. Then I went to Hazel's house and she dyed my hair. Red. Hazel dyed my hair red. So instead of having curly blonde hair I had straight red hair (I've been straightening my hair you see). I liked it. Others didn't. And when I went into work to show Amy (the girl who took advantage of my drunken state and convinced me to buy the hair dye) I was told that I may have to talk to the manager about keeping my hair that way. Needless to say I wasn't impressed. But rather then screw around with talking to people, my mum dyed over top of it with brown. Now I have curly brownish-red hair. I like it.  As you can see I am posting this when I should be at school. I haven't been at school much lately because we've been doing speeches. So now I'm on daily attendance report. Yay for me!!! Actually, the reason I'm off today is because I had trouble sleeping last night and I feel like crap. Anyway, I'm dumb and yeah. This post was almost unbearable to write because I'm finding it hard to articulate at the moment and writing things and making them sound interesting is a fucking AAARRRRGGGGHHH no I can't do it.  PS: Hazel, thank you once again for the email  Songs I've listened to while writing this post: Franz Ferdinand - The Dark of the Matinee Franz Ferdinand - Take Me Out  'Why are you so petrified of silence? Here can you handle this? ... '
