In case anyone is interested, I'm writing on  urlLink the autobiography of an ex-colored man .  The book is about a guy who travels around the US and Europe, sometimes as a black man, sometimes as a white man.  THe paper is about how, in every place he visits, we get a slightly different conception of race.  I recommend the book highly, and the paper not at all.
