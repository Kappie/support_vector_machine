I just spent the whole day riding in the back of an old, cramped van, and my body is begging me for rest, but my stupid desire to post here is preventing me from getting any unconscious time to myself.  Anyway, about the picture, this is some building near where my hotel was in NY.  I thought it looked mighty neato and I also thought it would make a great wallpaper.  If any of you want a nice, full-quality, 1280-by-960 pixel version of this picture for your desktop, just leave a comment with your e-mail addy like I said in that other post and I'll send it direct to ya, spam not included.
