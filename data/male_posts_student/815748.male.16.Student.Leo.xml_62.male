Model UN was on Monday; this is the first issue in which I don't have a resolution since that poverty issue last year.  Matt K-K's resolution is just like all his othersâ€“ spends a lot of money, takes years to fulfill, and does absolutely nothing.  HMUN (Harvard Model UN) is next week Thursday through Sunday, that might be fun, in a boring kind of way.  We'll see.  I'm going to have to work hard over the weekend to revamp my Palmer direct.  It's good as it is, but it needs a lot of work.  I don't know if I stand a chance against Martin and Hodes, I'll try to memorize it and be really simple on cross.  I could use your help, MT readers (btw, never say MT when referring to Math Team.  Mock Trials totally gang-rapes Math Team).  My studio production is tomorrow.  I'll let you see the tape when it's finished.  On Saturday, John, Jonny, Dan Waldinger and I are going to see "The Last Samurai."  Below is the plan:  2:30- arrive at Jonny's house (leave Stupid Team early)  3:00- leave for movie, driven by Jonny's dad  3:30- movie begins  5:45- movie ends... and then, who knows?   The following are "Celebrity Secrets" said by Ringo Starr on Conan:   "I remember when the Beatles broke up. I was the only one showing up for tour dates for two months when I finally put the pieces together!"  "Yeah, it was incredible, the drugs, the sex, the all- night parties. I really miss that Shining Time Station."  "Do I really miss all the girls screaming and chasing me? No, because I imagine it's still going on. And here they come!"
