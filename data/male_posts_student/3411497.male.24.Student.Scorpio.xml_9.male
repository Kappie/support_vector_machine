Also, for the sake of the reader's ease and comfort, this entry is divided into four sections -- shout-out, cranky, heffalump, and much-luv.  If you do not want to read The Black Blossom's thoughts on the presidency and death of Ronald Reagan, please skip "Section Heffalump".  Thank you.    SECTION SHOUT-OUT   There is a possibility that you are a stranger -- that you do not know who I am, and read this anyway because you surf the 'net a lot, and believe you have stumbled upon the ramblings of a genius.  If this is the case, I would like to tell you that I know three people that you don't -- which is your loss, because these three people have ruled in recent memory, and deserve public recognition for it.  The first person is a friend of mine named Nate.  A few nights ago he espoused to me his theory that cats are domesticated vermin.  The ramifications of this small lecture reached far beyond just the biological niche of house-held felines -- and straight into comic genius.  He may not think of it as a good bit, but it was as good a bit as I've  ever  heard... and for all future comic purposes, I will be referring to cats as domesticated vermin.  What was truly odd was how similar his theory was to my often pseudo-scientific sense of humor... I could've come up with the idea, but he did.  Oh well, at least I have the "whales vs. humans armageddon" idea.  The second person is another friend, named Gaya, who gave me a talking-to after I wrote her a sad email.  Having another's concern is always nice, even if it means they're concerned.  I'm sorry if I concern anybody -- but if I do concern you, please let me know, because it'll make me feel better and you'll have less to be concerned about.  Anyways, I wasn't expecting a talking-to, and it was very kind.  The third person is another friend, Angela.  Angela may be the only person that is as cool as me.  She's like a female Fonz for the new millenium.     SECTION CRANKY   After a disruptive period of life known as "house-painting and re-carpeting", I am hoping to regain the once glorious method of writing on this thing once a day... I have finished my obligations of painting thus far, making the final strokes just this morning.  Overall, however, the entire thing has sucked and my room is now a monstrous mess of things that needed to be moved, and will need to be moved again for tomorrow's recarpeting.  Even The Black Blossom is vulnerable to the inconveniences of style.  So I'm going to say a few things: some of them good, some of them of nice, and some of them not-so-nice and arguably bad.  So we'll start with the mixed stuff, and move towards the good stuff, because that way everybody can go back to what they were doing feeling relatively good about things... that's always the best way to do things: say something nice, criticize, then say something nice again.  There's always room for positivity!  Now let's hug.   SECTION HEFFALUMP   Actually, let's not hug.  Reagan died.  Now, I'd be lying if I said I "liked" Reagan -- I'd also be lying if I said I "respected" Reagan.  In fact, I'd be lying if I said I had anything purely positive to say about the man... I think he was a horrible president, and like many politicians, I ultimately consider him to be a liar and a murderer.  No amount of Cold War thawing is going to excuse his endorsement and installation of Pinochet in Chile, or his involvement in the Iran-Contra scandals.  Nor can it go unnoticed that despite his constant promises of reducing the national debt, under his presidency the debt and deficit increased dramatically.  I understand that to some he is a hero -- and that's fine... but I think any fair-thinking individual will have to admit that Reagan's legacy is a mixed one, at best.  I tend to think of him as a Republican's Clinton.  He was a smooth talker, and he fucked everything up for the other side of the political spectrum for eight years.  He was so likable that while I was growing up (and clueless, let's not forget), I practically thought the guy was my grandpa.  Leftists hate him though, just like heffalumps (not woozils) hate Clinton.  Personally, I'm not a fan of either one...   SECTION MUCH-LUV   All of that said, the current political setting of these United States is quite the interesting one -- so interesting, in fact, that even a cursory glance at the events on Capitol Hill is maddening.  I wish Gandhi were alive so he could walk down a line composed of the President and his Cabinet, slapping every single one of them across the face.  There are times that I don't really know what to do.  Now is one of them.  My house is in disarray, my car is broke, and I have no clean clothes -- in a larger sense, this is also the problem of the entire country: we don't know what we're doing, we aren't going anywhere, and we look dirty.
