I lost track of that and started longing for friends. No man is an island. I don't wanna be an island. I've got Leon, and Pang and my Feirfield friends and my CAPpers and my Pioneers and my UWC'rs to fall back to. I forgot why I didn't want ACSians. They swear, cheat, lie, bicker and brag. I don't want to become like that. You can take your excusivity and shove it.  I'll stick, butI'll keept a few though.
