I still find I like LCAC better though, but NP does have its perks I guess.....if you really like to go to a big church with a lot of people, then NP would probably be a good choice. At the moment though I'm stickin' with LCAC, as it still needs a lot more help running than NP.  So after chuch, came home, ate....and yeah just sat around home for the whole day.  Watched Blue Streak....great movie hehe.  Anyways yeah.......tomorrow don't know what's gonna happen......Civic holiday and stuff, so everywhere is closed basically, or open for shorter hours.  Hopefully I can figure out something to do tomorrow hehe.  Later.
