Ive been dead you know. My classes ended well for those of you that wanted to know. Thankyou. I have been spending the day getting errands done, and doing things that i have wanted to do for a long time. One of those things was sharpening my skills on html code. Ive made some progress. As a result this website should be a little more exciting. One of the other things was doing tonight was looking over a list of websites i had written down a while back. One of the websites was  urlLink www.spacelaser.com  , which is a website for the Mueller Planetarium. The website lists the times and showing of laser light shows. Fantastic! From there i found a website for space news. And at that website was this little test to see if you knew which state had the most coastline. When i tried to answer i was directed to  urlLink this site , which claimed it was the home of the original online iq test. I took it. I got a 123. Somehow i found another site and took their test and got a 124. Then i found another site which i felt was really good because it talked about the results of my score for free. (the other sites wanted money. This one gave all kinds of fun facts for free.) The following is from that third website:        Your age adjusted IQ score is   126  and the average score for all test takers is 100.  You scored higher than 97 % of all the people that took this test        Grade    Range    Percent      Genius    144    0.13%      Gifted     130-144    2.14%      Above average     115-129    13.59%       Higher   than average      100-114    34.13%        Lower     than average       85-99    34.13%       Below average     70-84     13.59%      Bo rderli ne low    55-69     2.14%       Low    55    0.13%
