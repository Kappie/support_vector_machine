I went downstairs to the bakery opposite to get myself a coffee to keep the donuts company... first time I'm getting a coffee from this place. Now when I say "flat white coffee," I understand it to be a coffee with some milk added and no... I repeat NO Fuckin' Froth! It turns out that my "flat white" is approximately 46.2% froth... and I paid 3 whole dollars for this barista's abomination. Back in Bombay, I've had better (and more) coffee for 1/10th the price. I miss Bombay. Aww dammit... my coffee's gone cold...
