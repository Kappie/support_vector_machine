For Myself, Kay, Ray and Volch it began on Saturday at around 545 PM.  The ride from Scranton/WB was basically a straight shot according to Markle's directions. Follow 81 South, Pick up 83 and then get of at Glen Brook..."If you guys make it to Glen Rock I'll Pick you up there."  Well..around 745 we arrived in what the exit said was Glen Rock and we told Markle to pick us up..who apparently thought we got lost but he didn realize he didn't give us directions past the exit. Ahh yes..Glen Rock...Cows...Grass..more cows and more grass...a bull..a brief strip of almost-civilization which was comprised of a few houses, a getty and a hick bar..more grass..a cow...and we arrive at the Markle Estate in Glenville.  Immediately after arriving, I dropped off the admiral, the captain silver and the 99 apples above Markle's Garage, aka..his studio. Basically its John boy's playroom..nice room too with a bar. After Greeting The Franks, The Smudins, Brad, and Sue, I headed downstairs and over to the Markle house where Mr. and Mrs. Markle had TONS of food prepared..chicken wings, lasagna, sausage and peppers, burgers, and several types of salads and deserts.  The food was really good and the "Southern(PA)" hospitality was much appreciated.  We ate as much as we could to prepare for the drinking that was coming soon and so as not to offend our gracious hosts..then headed back up to Club Markle.  Thats what i'm going to refer to Markle's Studio Room as  from here on out.  It was early yet, so Markle decided to show us some of his and his half brothers video productions and play some music live with one of his local friends.  Markle did a damn good job on drums and guitar, but I think I would have rather heard one of the cattle from a nearby field sing. Eventually a spilt occurred...the frat crowd went outside one by one..We all began to wonder where the beer was...and the preps stayed inside and listened to the music.  Eventually we lured Markle outside to ask him about the beer and to our dismay there wasn't any...BUT there was a bar down the road we could get some at.  The 2 mile trek to bar began as Kayla, Ray, Volch and Franky bod piled into my car, and the Smudins and Jersey Frank piled into the SmudinMobile. I think we were all pretty much prepared for what we were going to ecounter when we opened the door to that bar, but none of us were prepared for the sight the guy passed out or dead on the kitchen floor in front of the cooler as we walked by a side door to get to the main door.  We opened the door to find a hick bar..as expected..with the added "pleasure" of old toothless people in overalls playing fiddles and banjos creating a night that frequent patrons of the bar would call the best night in their entire lives.  We, however were a group of college age kids who knew this night would be nothing short of a nightmare had we not brought some beer back to the Markle Plantation.  Low and Behold..they had beer to go...One kind to be exact: Natural Light, which they sold at the cost of $8.50 a 12 pack. On a side note, Natty cost $9.99 a 24 pack here in old forge. Do the Math, Its easy: College Kids who need beer + a crafty mulleted bartender with a natty surplus=Profit for them and a headache the next day for us.   FINE we got the beer...we brought the party to the Markle Kingdom.  ZETA PI BABY!!! Anyway  the night unfolded as Volch kept his legacy alive and entertained the prep hicks to no end.  Everyone Drank heavily...well at least us frat boys did...now the prep hicks..they drank..and puked...and passed out..and lets face it..they need to drink more often..friggin lightweights. The Smudins both got really wasted and illustrated the one characteristic that assures everyone around that they are indeed sisters, and that being what Myself, Kay and Ray created into a new verb. First..used in context... here's an example. "Volch Smudined on the floor." Its pronounced like this SMOO DIHND Basically...When the smudins are really drunk, they have a habit of standing up...then all of a sudden out of nowhere...falling flat on the floor..and on the way down smacking their head off of something. Its an amazing thing to watch...totally amazing. During the party, Club Markle kicked in, Jersey Frank became DJ, The bright lights went off, the club style lights kicked in, and raylo became the bar tender.  I gave one of the prep hicks the idea of making a Beer Bong out of a soda bottle and a hose and the resourceful little fucker actually did it in a matter of 20 minutes...not bad!!  This is the first time we at Zeta Pi can say that we actually threw in Glen Ville, PA.  We brought the party...we added the summer bash to the markle smash, we put the fest in the markle and everyone had an awesome time.  The Party went on until about 4am...The Smudins had both Smudined on couches...the puking prep passed out..the slut went home..the mystery girl disappeared...the rest of the hick preps went home to wash their polo shirts...and volch finished entertaining for the night and passed out covered in mud from head to toe.  There was, however one soul that couldn't sleep an eye...The Bod...As Frank tried to sleep he was interrupted by an orchestra of snoring..from several people.  At around 7am, i decided freezing my balls off in a car wasn't the best thing to do and decided to go home early...so we packed up Erins camera, The remainder of our liquor, and the Volch and made our way home. I drove half of the way..dazed and confused..out of it the entire time...half from the natty still in my system and half from not sleeping enough..and apparently I had several off the wall conversations about naming my kids rolling rock and cosmopolitan..and at one point had to have something medical explained to me in terms of BBQ chicken and fried chicken. RayLo Drove the rest of the way home and eventually kay and i crashed until about 430 in the afternoon.  And Sgt markle...well..we dont know what became of him after that night...the last words muttered by him around 1015 this morning were "you came you drank you passed out, and thats what Marklefest is all about"...But to clarify..we came..we saw..we blew the roof off the markle estate..and THAT is what ZETA PI is all about.  I Hate Antelopes, -John
