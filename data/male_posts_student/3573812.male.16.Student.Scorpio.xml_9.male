I went to pick up the CDs she made me (she didn't bring them to work).  I'm listening to the first one at the moment.  The first song 'Bombs over Baghdad' by Outkast and Rage Against the Machine was good.  I also love the live acoustic version of 'The Hollow' by A Perfect Circle.  It is more mellow than the original yet more intense.  I worked tonight.  I usually only work Wednesday and Friday nights and all day Sunday, but I was called in because people were 'sick' (AKA going to the numerous balls that are on tonight).  I did some studying for my upcoming English assessment today.  We have to write an essay that must argue the following statement, 'And Lord Acton said, 'Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely'.  We have use examples from history, modern day and the novel we studied, 'Animal Farm' by George Orwell.  I don't know whether I'll pass.  Maybe I'm just being pessimistic.  I'm obsessed with blogs at the moment.  I have fourteen saved in my favourites!  And only three of those people are people I know!  I love reading other blogs, especially the insightful ones, and the ones by people that think like me.  I've left so many comments I've lost count.  And I've sent a couple of emails to tell the people how much I enjoy reading their blogs.  One woman sent back a reply saying '...thank you so much again for you very kind words. They are encouraging for me to keep writing.'  That was nice.  Current ... book I'm reading: Brilliance of the Mood song I'm listening to: Rent - Pet Shop Boys fav song: AFI - Silver and Cold
