Been meaning to catch an episode because the concept is cool, and something I've thought would be a cool gimmick for a screenplay or a tv show, done well -- adult, through some unexplained accident, gets to go back in time and re-live high school, knowing what he knows as an adult.  Could be really good.  This sitcom, however, wasn't.  Instead of using the concept to create interesting dilemmas for the character -- save someone from heading down a road he knows leads to disaster at the cost of affecting your own future negatively? -- this show's writers used it purely as an excuse to have the character say one-liners that are funny to him but no one else knows what he's talking about.  "Oh -- look how stupid the son of Vice President Bush is.  He'll never amount to anything."  "I wouldn't be so sure."  One of the subplots of the episode I saw was the kid turns in the Nirvana song "Smells Like Teen Spirit" as a poetry class assignment, and the teacher gets concerned.  What a waste of a good concept.  Kind of like the movie "Galaxy Quest."  Cool idea.  But the execution totally wasted the potential.
