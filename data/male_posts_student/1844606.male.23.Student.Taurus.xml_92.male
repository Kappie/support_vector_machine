Fortunatley someone translated the froggspeak into good ol' American English.  God I'm sick of "patriots" on TV flapping their right wing lips about a liberal media...Anne Coulter I'm looking in your general direction.  But you know what, I also respect the fact we have FREEDOM OF SPEECH so they are allowed to do whatever they please.  My dad used the term Jail Bait in an email to me today.   I have only one paragraph written for a story which should be at least 10 pages and is due before 5pm on Thur.  I plan on just writing about when my dad was in the hospital, make it kind of sentimental.  Maybe it won't be totally fictional, but right now I'm sick of writing about shit.  I read a theory book on comics called "Understanding Comics" by Scott McCloud.  Smart stuff, deceptively difficult.  Brings in deconstruction stuff.  That's some stuff I don't want to visit again, but its rearing its ugly head...damn lit theory.  And guess what, one of the leading advocated of the movement was a frenchy frog...You know, for all that America says is wrong with France, they are producing a shit load of more intelligent criticism across the board.  We give them freedom fries and Rush Limbaugh.
