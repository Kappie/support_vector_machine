I came across a comment i made concerning my pal Maz, and how she's coming down this Wednesday. I also then came across a part concerning Daniel, and freaked out - im supposed to be getting together with him on Wednesday!   SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!  I dunno wot the hell to do - if i cancel any more dates hes gonna think i dont wanna do them (or him, for that matter) which i totally do!   SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!
