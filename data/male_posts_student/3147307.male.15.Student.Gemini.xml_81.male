She explained why her costume is so, well, not much of a costume - you don't want to know why. I also watched Hithcock's  North By Northwest  - one of the most famous scenes in that movie is filmed in Indiana. Anyways it was a good suspenseful movie, but some of the green screen working was very outdated. Since I watch many movies I think I'll start a rating system. **** - Must see. *** - Good. ** - some may enjoy it. * - why would you watch it?. OK, North by Northwest gets a **1/2 star rating in my book.  Life is Beauiful , on the other hand, **** - you MUST see it.
