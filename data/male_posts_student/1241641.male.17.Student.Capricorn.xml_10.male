I hope you all enjoy the new look of The Schism and the new Adventures in Dissent journal.  A lot has happened since The Schism was first launched in November 2003.  Perhaps you remember my first post about the Panera sandwich line, and how I loathed it so.  They figured out that I could not make a sandwich to save my life so they put me back out in the dining room where I thrived at making coffee, filling condiment and ice stations, and cleaning tables.  Once a new crop of Panera associates, or Panerites, came in they decided to get me trained in the bakery.  So there I was, slightly more competent, when suddenly, things took a turn.  Yes, I was back on the line for a night.  Luckily, I was in good company.  It was the Flathenator and I rocking the Bravos and the Black Beans.  And, to my luck, an overly observant manager witnessed my newfound sandwich construction abilities.  Suddenly I was a sandwich artist, so to speak.  So now you are expecting me to whine about it?  I'll have you know things are so much better this time around.  But so help me God, they better get me trained elsewhere.  My good friend and partner in crime, Colin, and I are embarking on a new musical journey this summer.  For this project we will be in broadcasting.  After some wheeling and dealings with the people who pull the strings at KALA, we were able to get a weekly radio shift for the summer.  You all can tune in around the Quad City area at 88.5MHz on Mondays from 2pm-5pm.  Well that's it for me.  Cross your fingers that this summer I find some stuff to write about in my journal.  Adios.
