Ann is moving to 3rd period French. :'( I might move there, so I can have 5th period history honors. Ugh my dad just walked up and was looking if I was on both computers, which I am, and now he is giving me this whole damn speech about lightening up. DON'T READ WHAT I WRITE! I hate when ppl read over my shoulder on what I write. But moving on................one more day till I can see Quinn. I'm soooooooooooooooooo excited!
