I just got back home last night from my great grandma's funeral. It was horrible. I don't deal with death too well. I did have a good time when I got home last night. I called Carrie and she came over and picked me up. Carrie, Melanie, and I hung out at Chris's house for a while. (The trick still won't ask Carrie out.) We are planning on having a good time tonight too. I miss all my friends from school. I haven't seen many of them since school has been out. I've seen Holly a few times, but I miss Amy and Elisa. I really miss Ashley too. I haven't seen her all summer. I'm still with my bf Josh. He is so awesome. I love him so much.  Well.. I'm kinda out of stuff to write. I'll try to write more tonight maybe or maybe tomorrow. Well.. that's all folks.
