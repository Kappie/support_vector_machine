Honestly, why must the whole class be made to protect this child? Can't the child NOT put penuts in its mouth? What if the child had asthma instead? Should everyone have inhalers on them just in case the child forgot his?   Hell, maybe the teacher could actually watch the kid eat his lunch, to make sure it is free from anything that "may or may not have been processed in a plant that also processes penuts."  Yes, kids are stupid. That's one of their more endearing traits. They ahve the excuse of inexperience. I don't meant the child with the allergies is unworthy of life and deserves to die, just that the child should know better on ingesting penuts. It is the child's responsibility ultimately to refrain from doing itself harm. Electrical sockets and traffic accidents are not in the same leauge as eating penuts. Maybe there would be an uncontrollable urge to eat a penut to find out what he's been missing. Fair enough. But I want to know when exactly the need to punish the group to protect this child ends. When is he able to control his own eating?
