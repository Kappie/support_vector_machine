And, after a long time, i realise that i have to learn how to be committed to certain things and people...  yup! 'Finally!' is what many would say to me, after knowing me for so long, friends would have been lamenting about me not being able to committ myself to certain things for a long period of time. Honestly though, think back and see for yourself, haven't i been able to committ myself to certain things or people? haha... can't say anything more right? Examples? haha... Looking back in time, i am pretty sure that i've been committed to my work, my CCA and certainly, when i was attached, the girl(s) that i was with. Indeed i admit, that though some of my relationships were short, i was at least 100% committed, but... facing many and relentless problems, i had to give them up somehow all except the last one, which i simply had to stop cause, it was just too much for me to bear.  However, with the incoming promos and upcoming SYF next year, i have to take up and put in my committments again, after being so slack for the past 7 months! Haha... yes, i know that i suck big time, but i can't help it lah. The problem though, that has been nagging me is the perception of people who views me as a person who can't stick to 1 girl! Hey peopel, news flash! Perhaps, it's not me, but perhaps it's you guys whom have been giving me problems?! ok... that wasn't a nice thing to say lah, but seriously, i am sick and tired of people calling me things that are not true! Damn it, look at Benjamin, on my tag board, he called me a flirt, but after that, he admitted that he has never even seen me flirting at all! He did it for the FUN of the moment! My friends, do that all the time too! what's the reason?! For FUN! come on people, have you guys ever spared a thought for others? Have you ever thought that you might be hurting the person without the intention too? In case, you don't realise it ah, but everytime i am called that, i do get hurt, pulling myself back further into the shell and shield that i have built for myself... Fearing that people would start insulting me again. Understandably, i was once a very flirtatious and buaya kind of guy, but, are you sure i am still like that? haiz... i don't even understand why i have to explain myself, it's just that there is so many misunderstanding views about me... come on lah, shit... Who in the world doesn't flirt? forget it lah, i am just so tired of this, and i hope that people would understand!  Wah lau! i can't stand it lah! Some girl from my school went to my chinese tuition teacher whom by the way is my aunt and said that i was like... famous lah! Say don't know what, i got a lot of girl friends and than my stupid aunt went to tell my mom lah! wah lau! What is this?! i am innocent lah! Please loh, do you often see me around many girls?! NO RIGHT?! haiz... and please hor, i only like 1 and only 1 girl!!!  I think people who know me would by now know who is this girl, besides, she is so consitently mentioned on my blog... I don't know lah, i just feeling really drained... However, i can say that no matter what, i will stay committed to who i like now, no matter how hard it may be, i won't let anything get me down, nor will i let anything make me give up. I promise even more that i would not be a bloody playboy kind of mentality and go after another girl... All i want now is to convince her that i really like her cause i really do and from than on, see what happens... All i am asking now is that she would at least trust me this bit... To the girl: Trust me ok? i know it's hard for me to ask this of you considering what stories you have heard of me, but know that i won't give up and that i will wait until the day you believe me. Whatever it is, i will stay here and would always be here for you...  Ok... now that i've got it off my chest, i feel much better... To everyone, thanks for putting up with me and my whining! haha... Anyway, friends and pals, do take care ok? i know that everyone of us is facing trouble and problems each day, and i would like everyone to know that i would be here for you as a friend! Especially, for... (you know who lah! ;p) To my friends that are down and out, cheer up ok? There is always something positive to look forward too! If you feel like God has let you down, like how Zhen Yang has put it in his devotions today, he is just not done with you yet! Be patient and simply pray to the Father for strength! Take care everyone and remember to... LIVE LIFE TO THE FULLEST! ;p
