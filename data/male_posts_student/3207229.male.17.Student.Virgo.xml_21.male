It is quite obviously a "satirical song", as my friend says, but I'll have to read it a few more times before I fully appreciate it. Furthermore, dpen2000 humbles appolgises for the assumptions of the previous post. (They were great points, though, eh?)   Oh yeah, for those, like me, who have never heard this strange phrase(it still is) before, Google has 8,740 references to it. Where on earth were we? ;-) Here's a  urlLink tiny  for them:  urlLink http://tinyurl.com/64cb7 .
