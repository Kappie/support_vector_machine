Then i MIGHT pop down to his house for ten minutes tomorrow, coz, lets face it - he'll have the house all to himself, and it would just be rude not to stop by to say a quick hi-and-goodbye. For some reason he doesnt find that satisfying however, and may force a longer stay on me.  Lemme tell you, if this bloody great zit doesnt go away i aint going anywhere, i dont care how "smitten" i am. Screw smitten - i wanna be cleeeeeeaaaaan! How come no matter how much you shower you still end up with spots?! I scrub with perfectly good, soap-free shower products, and rinse as perfectly as possible. WHY GOD?! WHAT DID I EVER DO TO YOU?! :'(    All i really wanted was some of your time Instead you told me lies when someone else was on your mind What'd you do to me?  Look what you did to me. I thought that you were sumone who would do me right Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry What'd you do to me? Can't take what you did to me.    Sorry, just love that song. No reflection on how i feel.  Well there's only one word for yesterday - "eventful".  (1) Mum found out about David. (2) I had my hospital appointment. (3) Maureen had her new bouncy baby boy.   -> (1)Yeah, i awoke to a fone call from mum concerning how i was to fone my father (having found out that North Lanarkshire Educational Dept are giving me Â£450 for SYT! YAY!). She also happened to mention that we needed to "talk about trust", and then revealed she had been reading my text messages. Well we certainly did need to talk about trust, considering she'd been butting in to my business. Anywayz, we talked it out and after a BIG arguement we sorted things out. She's still having trust issues with me, although she has a cheek, and is still moody. She thinks i'm going off on one like i'm crazy or something, as if i'm on a destructive pathway that'll only lead to jail or my untimely death. *Pfft* I love you mother, and i understand that you worry...but get real.  -> (2)It wasnt actually as bad as i thought it would be. The CT scan i have to go in for was pretty much an expected (although apparently there was no reason to suspect it - mum). The brain-mapping and four different blood-tests were new though. The doctor says that i have a weakened nervous system, which happens pretty much only to people my age, and that it'll all go away eventually. In the meantime im stuck with the headaches and the passing out, but im fine with it. Ive had them both long enough to be used to them. Plus my threshold for pain, cold, heat and other stimuli is stronger because of the weaker nervous impulses going to my brain. Seems it's a blessing as much as a curse, and it would probably explain the very hot and very cold showers i manage to have, as well as the never-wearing-a-jacket-coz-i-dont-feel-i-need-one thing that drives mum mad.  -> (3) Speaks for itself doesnt it? At sometime after 10am, my aunt and godmother Maureen Murray gave birth to her second child, a second son. 12 ounces i think. Possibly not. Anywayz....AWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!! I really woulda gone to the cinema with David if i couldve last nite, but AWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!! Duuuuuude, he was soooo teeeeeeny-weeeeeny, as babies usually are. They wont end up naming him for like two weeks (thats how long it took to decide a name for Jamie, theyre first son, who looked adorable seeing his baby brother for the first time...i was actually near tears watching him). However, that stopped no one from suggesting names. Our reccomendations included:  Matthew Murray Fernando Murray Mad-Dog Murray Jebediah Murray  and, of course, my own invention:  Canestan Murray.  Dude they should soooo call him that!  Anywayz, i think im gonna copy and paste this into my LiveJournal, and then im gonna get back to me exercising to get all fit and toned for Davey-Wavey. I jst gotta get rid of a little bit of fat to make my abnormally shaped pecs solid muscle instead of looking like manboobs.  Peace out biatches!  xxxxxx
