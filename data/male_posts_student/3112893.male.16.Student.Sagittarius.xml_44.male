I don't usually have odd dreams and I almost never dream of the same thing twice and remember it, but these past few days have been really different. I have this one dream where I'm in a futuristic mall type place and everything is neon and has a 50ish foot ceiling and I always walk into the same store. It's a video game store with the same kids there and the same guys walking aroud, but each time I go there I do something different. What's particularly odd about this is that the NDC (Non Dreamer Characters) remember what I said and did while I was there last time. That's never happened to me before. There's this other dream I had too regarding my recently decieced cousin John Marie where after being decieved by my own perception and realizing it and being pissed off I find a 12mm handgun and start emptying the clip into a wooden fence. I fire 9 rounds and realize that someone might be on the other side of the fence so I go and check to find that no one's dead, but I find a group of suspicious people who I later find out are from a secret political party. This one cloaked guy tries to stab me with a kitchen knife. Of course he fails after I do some tricky stuff with my left hand to disarm him. I am now surrounded by 3 men, 1 stabber dude, and this one cute girl who were all in the original group. I stab one of the people under the ribcage after thinking that it would be too difficult to push the knife in and pull out if it went through his ribs. And when I pulled it out his wound was open but no blood poured out, however the knife was bloody (which I guess is pretty normal, but I have never dreamed in such detail before). It's kinda fuzzy after that but I end up shooting someone who I see later in the dream who doesn't die. When I shot him though, when the bullet entered, it was insanely realistic. No movie-type special effects or bullet wounds that don't bleed or anything. It was just so detailed and graphic. I also stab the girl after she tries some move on me, but I'm careful not to stab her tit so I stab right under the ribs again. There was a scene change and the story progresses on and on, but I won't bore you with it. I guess the dream isn't that weird, but my attention to detail is what amazed me.  THESE LINES ARE UNRELATED TO THIS PARAGRAPH: I HATE PETER'S KEYBOARD. ALL THE KEYS TAKE 2000 POUNDS OF FORCE TO RESPOND AND STICK ONCE YOU PRESS THEM. I GET EXHAUSTED AFTER USING THEM FOR 3 MINUTES/ I REALLY NEED TO BUY HIM A NEW KEYBOARD. HE SEEMS TO HAVE THIS DILUSSION THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SUFFER WHEN YOU USE A COMPUTER. wRONG-o, MAN. TOO MUCH DILBERT FOR YOU.  Getting back to what I was saying about my dreams, it's just weird. Like I said before, I don't want to go into too much detail (even though I went through a lot just then) because it's pretty uninteresting to even people with the most boring of lives. There's this other dream that I've had like three times in the past week and it also picks up where it left off. It's a dream about JM. I think I might not fully recognise that he's dead yet, but I am so confused by it all >_  ^ There is all kinds of redundancy in that past paragraph but I'm too lazy and I hate Peter's keyboard too much to fix it now. I'll work on it later. ^  Moving on, I still hate this stupid keyboard. I am exhausted. Peter is just asking for RSI. Ok, now that we have that out of the way, let's talk about the important issues. Moronic tabbers on olga.net. I hate morons who tab a normal chord as something absurdly awkward. A perfect example is tabbing C, G, and D as something other than the way they should be played. Someone decided it was smart to take a perfectly normal chord and arrange it such that three fingers are on one fret. For all of you wont don't play guitar, you almost never put more than two fingers on the same fret unless you're barring the whole thing or the fingers are at least a string apart. It's just so stupid. I am gonna make a site dedicated to taking stupid and poorly written tabs and rewriting them the way they should be, and of course it will be free. I haven't decided on a domain name or anything yet, but I will over the summer and news and updates and the like will be posted here among other places. I hope I can get Peter in on this, but he's got a lot of school work to avoid -- Eehh, I mean do.  We went up to the hill that JM crashed on yesterday and had a mass for him. We didn't have any beers or anything exciting like that, but we DID play some songs on our guitars for him. T'was nice I think, but a bit disturbing to see where it all went down. I miss JM. Rest in Peace, cousin.  Anyway, this keyboard is making me sick to my gut and I feel like vomitting so I am gonna go now. That is all.         -- Feanor
