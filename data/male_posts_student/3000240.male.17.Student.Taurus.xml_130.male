Well I say that actions and more specifically, websites speak louder than words on these underbelly delinquents of British teenage society, so brilliantly portrayed in this  urlLink link  (just watch, read, listen and laugh).  Anyway, my gig whore returned late last night thank God, and enough said really on how I began to feel amidst the dying embers of the weekend, after I returned from viewing Muse's stunning performance of the pyramid stage at Glastonbury, too see my little traxlover online (-:.  Feeling have definitely cooled back at home, we're basically talking on a normal playing feel, although it will never be happy families incarnate there, that's for sure.  I'm supposed to have this sociology key skills and coursework done and dusted by Thursday morning, however it all seems quite pointless doing any of it really considering I won't even be there next year anyway. Well I'm of for a drink . . . xBuBzx
