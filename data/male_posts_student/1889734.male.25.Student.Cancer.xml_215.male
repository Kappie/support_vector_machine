They earn exactly what they are worth. Higher wages will do nothing but raise costs for consumers. It's just as absurd as raising the minimum wage. Doing that does nothing for the "poor." They are still just as "poor" as they were before. Their income is still low.   This crazy idea of a "living wage" is just communism. "From each according to his ability, to each according to his need." - Marx. Why should the unskilled and basically worthless people that work at Wal-Mart be allowed to steal money from others? Because they are "poor"? I say, let Wal-Mart come in and destroy all the stores that depend on union labor. I would prefer the abolition of all unions, but replacing the jobs themselves with non-union members will do just as well.
