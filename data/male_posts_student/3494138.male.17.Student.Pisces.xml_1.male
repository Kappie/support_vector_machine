Really cool guy.  Very creative and very funny.  Comes up with the craziest shit.  Last night, we were at In 'N Out, and we saw this van that said "Reliable Transportation" on the side.  So Nick suggests that we slash its tires and sue the company cuz they're van wouldn't be reliable anymore.  We were laughing so hard, cuz with Nick everything is done half-serious and half-jokingly.  Then we went to an arcade and we all tried that crazy dancing game with the stepping pad thingy.  That was hilarious, too.  We all suck.  People were laughing.  Oh well.....we were laughing with them.  We had lotsa fun.  Damn, I sure am gonna miss these good times......
