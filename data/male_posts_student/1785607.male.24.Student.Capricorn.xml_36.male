The one thing I don't know what's going on is the one with my boyfriend. Sometimes I feel not needed at all, not that I want to be thought of 24/7 but the change I feel in him respect me is somewhat that I don't like. I fear that I might need to change the way I behave or maybe just the way I think when around him in order to not feel hurt. I got thinking the other day and is a part of the circle of a relationship, and in this one, I think I am ( again ) the one that needs the most. He loves me? I think he does... With all his heart? I do believe he does... Has he changed? Maybe, now I think he sometimes takes me for granted, or could it be that he is so sure about my love that is never afraid of losing it? ... Well, he got a point there if that's the case.  The main problem is not him, is me. I got hit hard with love. When I get a hug from him, all my body feels at ease, at peace. When is time for him or me to leave, I start to ache for his company... That's how much I love him. I wake up in the morning and see the clock over at the night table and instantly at the moment I see time, I think about him: What's he doing? He must be asleep! Will he call me today? Should I call first?... I think I got dependent on him and is making me feel so down when not around him.  One thing I do feel is his fault is the lost of personal time between us. I remember prior to our first night together that he said to me: I want to be with you, just the two of us, alone in some place where we can be at ease... Now he had the opportunity in two occasions and he just wasted them. I was here, waiting for the moments with him, he showed up, but it was late and...   Now he'll spend this three coming days in Mxl, chances are that if I don't call him in the morning I won't be able to contact him when around the city, 'cause his phone either sucks or in the chance it works it will be in silent mode.  All in all, he is a great person, a laid back kind of guy. He did went with me to the concert and even though I noticed he was not happy about it, he was there with ME. He says he loves me, I might be a fool but I do believe him. When I am with him, aside from the recent facts, I am happy, I feel secure, I feel peace inside. And, maybe is all those feelings the ones I ache for. Today, more in the day, I think I'll be able to move around my thoughts and talk to him... I need to talk to him.  Funny thing, my friend, Becky, met him Sunday night and told me: "He is a player, is what I can sense. All in all is a nice guy." Maybe he is, maybe he is not. At the beginning I thought he was, now he's my bf and I love him with all my heart... And are all the details he has with me the ones that win me over an over.   You know what, is me the one that makes up all this drama; I am the one feeling blue over stupid things; I am the one fixating on stupid behavior by his part ( but he is a kid, he needs that release, that doesn't mean he does not love me ); I am the one writing all this sad stories; why haven't I wrote the way he treats me all the time, the way he subtly touches me on the movies, the way he kisses my hand when we are in the car going someplace, the way he always ( well almost always ) appear in my house with a rose, the way he's not cheap with me, the way he agrees to go out with me in the morning even though he hasn't slept at all, and so much more. If I think I have demonstrated my love for him, he has done the same thing. He loves me, might be getting sick of me riding his hump all the time, but that's something I can change now. We love in a different way, but we love each other... I am needy, what can I say!
