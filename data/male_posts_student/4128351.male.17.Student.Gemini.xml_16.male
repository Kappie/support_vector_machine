If you don't have  all  of them, you better hurry and get them before you're labeled uncool.  Only kidding, you probably won't like half of them, but I love them all, so you should give them a shot.  Plus, I'd give everyone else's a shot, but no one ever tells me anything.  :)    We'll start off with good ol' JM.  I know you think John Mayer, and anyone that likes John Mayer, are flaming homosexuals.  The truth is, the man can play guitar and write good songs.        "In Your Atmosphere (LA Song)"- This one is unreleased, how JM's best songs usually stay.  He only breaks this out once or twice a year, it's his most beautiful one, most likely my first or second fave of his.  You should find it on KaZaa, but if not, IM me and I'll send it to you.  I don't want you to go without.        "Covered in Rain (Live from Any Given Thursday)"- This is the all-time favorite for me.  The emotion and the guitar solo and everything... it's beautiful, I love it.  Make sure it's from Any Given Thursday though, just so you have the best version.      Next, you need Ryan Adams in your system.        Here, take all of these: "Wildflowers", "When the Stars Go Blue", "World War 24", "Call Me on Your Way Back Home", "La Cienega Just Smiled", and "Goodnight, Hollywood Blvd."  That should last you for awhile, when you're done call me and I'll give you some more.        Radiohead, Radiohead, Radiohead... where do we begin?  I'll give you one song from each album or so to give you a taste.  This is going to be hard.        From  The Bends,  download "Just".  It's not my favorite, that would be "Street Spirit", "Bulletproof... I Wish I Was", "Fake Plastic Trees", "The Bends", and "Black Star".  OK, just by the whole damn CD, it's in my top five all-time albums.        Download the rest of these Radiohead songs: "Exit Music (For a Film)", "Karma Police", "Paranoid Android", "The Tourist", "Everything in It's Right Place", "Kid A", "The National Anthem", "Idioteque", "Motion Picture Soundtrack", "Sail to the Moon", "Where I End and You Begin", and "A Wolf at the Door".        There's so many more Radiohead songs, just download those for a start.  They are all wonderful songs.  Just like all the others I've recommended.       Here are ten more songs for now, I'll leave you alone then.       1- "Jimi Thing" by Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds, Live at Luther College   This song is great, but it contains the outro "What Will Become of Me", which is important for three reasons.        A) It contains one of my favorite, if not THE favorite, chord progression.     B) It later became "Pantala Naga Pampa", the first song off of  Before These Crowded Streets , one of my top five albums ever.     C) It's where I got the name of my blog.   Heh.  :)      2- "Pigeon" by Jump, Little Children.  Jay Clifford's voice is one of the greatest things ever.  No, I'm not gay either, I just appreciate a good voice when I hear it.       3- "A Movie Script Ending" by Death Cab for Cutie.  It's great... I love it...      4- "Tripping Billies" by Dave Matthews Band (Remember Two Things version).  DMB kicks so much ass it isn't funny.  I've been rocking out to this one lately, you'll like it.  All of you will.       5- "Wounded" by Third Eye Blind.  This is the stuff that they are capable of.        6- "#41" by Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds, Live at Luther College.  It's beautiful.      7- "Dancing Nancies" by Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds, Live at Luther College.  OK, OK.  So Live at Luther College rocks... just buy the double-album.  If you can't, I'll burn it for you and mail it to you, each and every one of you.      8- "War on War" by Wilco.  "You have to lose... you have to learn how to die if you ever want to be alive".  Jeff Tweedy, you're a genius.        9- "Grace" by Jeff Buckley.  Jefffffffffff.... I love you...       and last but not least,      10- "Happier" by Guster.  "Happier" is about high-school life.  You'll like it, it rocks.      I'm out for now, but thanks for bearing with me.  I love you all.      Keep cool my babies.
