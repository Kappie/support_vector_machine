As for aliens, how can one deny the fact that life can’t exist somewhere in this vast universe.    The proof is the fact that someone is reading this at all.    Humans exist in this universe and if humans can exist then why can’t other beings exist also.    I mean, what are the chances that our planet is the only planet in this entire existence that is capable of supporting life.    UFO sightings are too common to all be fakes.    I mean, yes, there are people who claim to have seen UFO’s and fake UFO sighting with a simple string, a tin object and camera or video camera.    These people are just looking for attention.    The sheer amounts of sightings though are too great too all be hoaxes.    As for whether aliens have landed, I don’t believe it.    I don’t think intelligent beings would risk an encounter with a species as destructive as us.    As for abductions, I’ve heard theories.    There is a particular one I’m very interested in.    Basically it states that these aliens are so advanced and evolved they’ve lost the ability to reproduce.    To put it simply, they’re dying.    They need our DNA and to re-sequence their own DNA to allow for reproduction.    It is also said that there will be a side effect to this.    These beings are so evolved they have lost the ability to love at all.    It is this lack affection that allows them to do the experiments they need on us to keep their way life alive, but as I was saying before the side effect of adding our DNA to their DNA is they may love again.    It’s all in our genes, how our hair looks in the brilliant sun, the way our eyes look when the moon hits them just right, and yes, love.    It’s all in our genes.    For the first time in a long time they will be able feel compassion for us and maybe there is hope for us yet.    There are two results of their compassion.    The first is them intervening in our busy lives showing us what we are doing wrong and helping us to become better beings.    The second is they destroy us before we make our way too far into the galaxy destroying and polluting planet by planet.    Either way, I don’t think I’ll live to see the day either happens.    Who ever reads this; I’d really like to know your feedback.    What do you think about the existence of aliens?    If you’re a believer, then why do you think they’re here?    I’m signing off for the night but I’ll leave you with a little quote I heard from a friend a while ago.             “When your soul is in doubt, look to the stars for answers” - anonymous
