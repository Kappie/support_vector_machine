There are moments which i really cherished but in a long run, i have no idea how it will affect the mental and physical state of us. This is only the 1st week of lectures and i'm beginning to feel a'lil bit of pressure down my neck. Could this be the reason for not being in school for too long a period? I seriously think i am putting too much undue stress on myself. I should focus on my subjects at the moment and think about the rest later. There's just so much a mind can handle eh.    Sometimes i do feel lonely... i have yet made any frens yet during my lectures. The only ppl i've met and gotta know are S'poreans who are already here and studying in different faculties. It's weird coz i'm going to lectures all by myself in a new environment. No more familiar Asians faces. i am now the minority. No more comfort zone. In a way, it might be good becoz i get to concentrate during the lectures but i guess in a long run, it might prove unhealthy. Well, i guess i'll be making some frens during tutorials. It's smaller and promotes more interaction between one another. Will see how it goes then.
