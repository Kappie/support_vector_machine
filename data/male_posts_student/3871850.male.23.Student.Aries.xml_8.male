Those who falls on 25th Dec better still.. the whole world is celebrating for them.. Hahaha.. Time is passing veri fast.. I was thinking of the past when I quarrelled with my two best campmates.. Edwin and Andrew.. I reali like them alot as they reali are my confidant especially Edwin.. Edwin reali know what I thinking most of the time and he understand how I felt.. while Andrew make a good kaki for me.. I hate to admit that in the end I loses both of them.. I guess so.. Actuali I alreadi cool down long time liao.. But I duno why I still can't open my mouth to talk to them.. I reali hope that time can turn back which is impossible.. so that I can patch up with them.. Anyway everything is too late.. I am sorry Edwin and Andrew.. pls forgive my childishness.. =(     There Once Were Two Men.. Who Travelled The Same Path For Ten Years..
