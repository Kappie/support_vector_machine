Now most men out there (the ones with higher levels of testosterone) would probably choose x-ray vision.  Right.  That would only get you so far.  Now if you asked me, I would say the ability to speed read, or the ability to touch a book, and know everything in it.  Think of the endless possibilities.  You could be a human library.  You could read every book in the world and tell everyone what they're about.  You could research this and that, in seconds and know everything there is to know.  What happens if you forgot something?  Oh, just touch the book again and bam it's back in your head.  So that's my pick for a superpower, I think.  I really can't think of anything better.  Post your comments and your picks if you had the choice of a superpower.  And you can't have more than one, like Superman, sorry.
