It's been a while since I've updated, but the server fucked up a little bit and it wouldn't let me log on. I have also been kinda busy. This is kind of random, but as a wrestling fan I have to say it. Randy Orton became the youngest champ ever! He is the man. Still don't have a new car, but soon I will. By the way, got some band info coming soon, as a new one is just over the horizon and it will finally be one that I can be proud of. Soon.
