People who are willing to get off their arse to search the entire  room for the tv remote because they refuse to walk to the tv and  change the channel manually.  3. When people say "Oh you just want to have your cake and eat  it too". Fucking right! What good is a cake if you can't eat it?  4. When people say "it's always the last place you look".  Of course it is. Why the fuck would you keep looking after you've  found it? Do people do this? Who and where are they  5. When people say while watching a film "did you see  that?". No tosser, I paid $8 to come to the cinema and stare at  the fucking floor.  6. People who ask "Can I ask you a question?". Didn't  really give me a choice there, did you sunshine?  7. When something is 'new and improved!'. Which is it? If it's new,  then there has never been anything before it. If it's an improvement,  then there must have been something before it.  8. When people say "life is short". What the fuck?? Life is  the longest damn thing anyone ever fucking does!! What can you do  that's longer?  9. When you are waiting for the bus and someone asks "Has the  bus come yet?".... If the bus came would I be standing here,  nobhead?
