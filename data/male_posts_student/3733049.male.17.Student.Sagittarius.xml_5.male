I think of it as the middle-ground between Manhattan and Yonkers,a sort of sub-culture of upper middle class baby boomers, the Golden Girlish-elderly( the only thing that outdoes the enumerous Oriental restaurants are the plethora of nursing homes in the area), Jews( a group of people i like but,sadly, find willingly molded in the stereotype society awards them, e.g. how strongly they take to and even pride themselves in their moneypinching and incessant whining and greed....note that i don't find all Jewish people to be this way but am merely annoyed with the concepts of stereotypes,when people make them to be true i find myself disgusted), and a bored and anxious youth yearning for adventure, purpose, anything else than what these quiet and isolated streets offer which is exactly that....quiet and isolation. Riverdale is a not-quite-suburbia that may be Mayberry to some(this is an allusion to The Andy Griffith Show)but to me it is a safe haven for adults that entraps the youth in its mediocrity preventing creativity, growth, and inspiration.   It is, however, better than where I first recall growing up in. It was a place down the hill in Kingsbridge that was okay, but a little too seedy. Let me explain, one night when my parents were out me and my sister trembled after the news reported a shooting near the block we lived on.   Another example was during Christmas night when I was very young. I played into the night with my new gifts and was running rampant throughout the tiny apartment and, in doing so, annoyed an already disgruntled downstairs neighbor to seek revenge for my calamity. He piled up various pieces of furniture in his house until it nearly reached the ceiling. In this tiny gap between the tower of miscellaneous furniture and the ceiling he placed gigantic speakers and blasted heavy-metal rock music throughout the night. My father would within an hour alert the police who broke into his home and find the massive structures that could have been mistaken for pop-art had they been quiet, or at least a few decibels lower. Not quite sure what happened to the guy though, maybe he decided to live with a family of ferrets or found his calling in life to become a used car salesman. Whatever the case is I am sure that depressed(maybe because the ferrets bit of all of his fingers or that he was maimed by a used car that spoke Arabic...damn those Terrorist cars) Even though I have many fond memories of this place, one can clearly see that we couldn't stay there for much longer.   One further note about Riverdale: I GOTTA GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE!!!
