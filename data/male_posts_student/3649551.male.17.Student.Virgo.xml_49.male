This phenomenon is most easily spotted (for me) by observing high school girls around college guys. Maybe it's because the younger crowd just assumes college kids are more knowledgeable and cool. Anything the college guy does has the high school girls reacting exactly the way he wants them to. If he wants them to buy some lie he just told, they will. If he wants them to laugh, they will. (Of course, this happens so often that some girls get a little confused and laugh at something that is obviously not funny at all.) I think it's as simple as a desire to be considered cool by someone you consider cool. This all happens in same-gender situations as well. I just find the guy/girl dynamic to be more interesting. Maybe that's why college students seem so superhuman to everybody else ... they spend a lot of time, not with the opposite gender, but with the SAME gender. It's the dorm effect. Guys spend so much time with other guys that they're just oozing masculinity. As a result, girls go wild, and vice-versa. And we all know the secret to being cool. It's evidenced by the foolish rappers who are becoming so freakin rich. You have to be ridiculous. But you have to be ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT in your own ridiculousness. And then you're cool. That's all there is to it.
