Pop Cap Games is responsible for many of the big name web games we see these days, and they've recently come out with yet another addicting game, called Zuma. In Zuma, your mission is simple- get rid of all the little balls on the map by shooting balls of the same color at them. As you progress, each level gets faster, so you'll have less time to complete. If the moving balls reach the trap door and fall in, then guess what? You lose. You get three lives, though, which is nice, so you won't automatically have to start over from the beginning.  I'm highly addicted to this game. I first found it at Yahoo Games when I was looking for something to play in my Business class last semester. Ever since, I think I dragged a few people into playing both in that class and yearbook. But, now that the school has blocked all instances of games from the school's servers, I can't do that anymore.  You control a little frog-like sphere thingy, which shoots out the jewels, or balls, or whatever you want to call them. You'll see what color you're about to spit out, and you need to aim it towards moving balls of the same color. Once you have a set of three, the balls go away, as can be seen in the screen shot below:     Your job is to obviously clear the board before the balls reach the trap door. So, you have to act quickly and have proper aiming techniques, or else you won't make it in the higher levels. I think the highest I've ever gotten to is around level 4-2. Around then, it really starts to get tough.  This game is highly addicting, its got nice graphics for a web game, and its definitely worth the score of  5 out of 5.
