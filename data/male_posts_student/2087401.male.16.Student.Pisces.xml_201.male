I'm trying to get my friend Marggy to stop hating Anakin Skywalker, so I'm chronicling the transition from Jake Lloyd to James Earl Jones, as it were. It's interesting. And now, a new feature: Erin's fanfiction recommendation of the week. You may never read it or even care, but I do. I recommend "The Winds of Change," a Star Wars fanfic by geo3 on fanfiction.net. It's 38 chapters long now, and very, very good. Yar! This Be a Superball!     ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?
