Like, some people get happy over girls (I do to, but it's far to passive), some people get happy over sports.... Blah, blah, blah.  Me?  I get happy over writting.  Typing makes me happy.  Seeing my thoughts transcribed into letters, and seeing that take shape.  It's like gardening.... Or something.    Random topic change.  "Or something" in some class (maybe African Studies) I was in a group, and  I'm talking and ended, and didn't get a response so I says to them says "Ah sumthin'." And I swear they (the group) all nodded.  "Prestigious black man" Mai huun?
