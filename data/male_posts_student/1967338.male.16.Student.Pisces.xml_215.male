That's eleven cousins, ladies and gentlemen, plus aunts and uncles. Fun! I almost got to see LOTR yesterday, but at the last minute, I didn't. So I'm probably seeing it next week. Marten-- other things that smell bad, if you're still thinking of doing that parody: we had wookiees and Governor Tarkin, but there's also A Tauntaun and The Inside of a Tauntaun. Enjoy yourself, everybody! That's about all I have to say. I fell down the chimney onto a flaming goose!
