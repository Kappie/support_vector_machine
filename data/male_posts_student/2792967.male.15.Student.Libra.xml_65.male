Jenna showed up, and, surprise surprise, Reegan was with her. So we go and say hi to them, and that ends up being the only thing I say to her. The rest of the time was spent me kyle and pete following them around like dogs. It was so unbelivably pathetic. Im not really sure how to take this, I expected at least a "hi, how are you", but its like she didnt even realize I was there. Its really discouraging, but Im not going to give up. I guess it will be a long while untill I talk to her again, so I was hoping to at least talk to her tonight, but, such is life.   ** Jimi Hendrix - Various Artists - The Wind Cries Mary **
