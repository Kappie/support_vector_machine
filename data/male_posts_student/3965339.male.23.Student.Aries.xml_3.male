And complacency, my friends, had no right visiting us that fateful summer moonlit night. 'Twas half past the chime of eleven when the effect of the alcohol began to affect our minds. A slow, painful process, ourselves to blame, and the lager we had bought and brought. I remember lying back and looking up and seeing something that i instantly knew was not to do... I saw a bright blue flame, like that of a bunsen burner, glowing in the shape of a portacabin. I was amazed I can tell you. Turns out it was just a portacabin ablaze after I'd set fire to it. I'd forgotten all about it until that point, and then I realised that I was absolutely wasted.  This is fiction at it's best!
