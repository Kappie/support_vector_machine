Reading one of the textbooks tonight only furthered my vitriolic rage; not only biased, it has numerous typographical errors. I would like to think that a Phd could spell Iraqis correctly ("Iraquis"?). One of the first questions asked of the prof today was "Are we going to have to know where any of the countries are?" :^ Seriously, if you can't find Middle Eastern countries on a map, it's time to turn off Survivor and turn on your brain. Sorry I'm being so negative, it just seems to be the appropriate route to take at the moment. Things will begin looking up when I realize that I don't have to listen to the lectures to get an A, and start doing other things in class. Like playing chess on my Palm Pilot. I am itching to write some of my thoughts on  urlLink  King Arthur  , but it's gonna have to wait.  Also, my thank-you letters are in the mail as of 9:30 this morning. I look forward to seeing many of you on here!
