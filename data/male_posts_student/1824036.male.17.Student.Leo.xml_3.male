Stupid Smackdown! is being replayed on a local channel on Saturday nights. But now they are starting to air some crap on the Kansas City Cheifs during that time slot. So that means that there is no SD! for me either! During the summer I would go over to Jadie's and watch Raw every once and a while. But now I cant!...Dang...now I'm mad...
