It allows your emotions to come out and lets you express how you are feeling.  Every time I feel low, I just sit at my keyboard, play a sad tune, and move on to happy ones from there.  Music itself is an expression to me.  It is truly a passion that I would be lost without.  Passions can do that, allow you to get lost in them.  Music is just mine however.  Think about what yours is and dig deeper into it.  It allows you to get to know yourself better.  So till next time, keep a song in your heart.
