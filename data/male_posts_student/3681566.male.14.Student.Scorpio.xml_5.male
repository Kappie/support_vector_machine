A busload of screaming kids, and then as we headed up to the movie, I exclaimed to my fellow LIT, "Great, first it was a bus full of screaming kids, now we can have a theatre full of them". My experience there was great though, I met some awesome people and had a wicked time. Well, I've been really busy lately, not really an excuse for not posting, but what the hell...
