People bitch about being Cubs fans or Dodgers fans or Red Sox fans (my dad, in his holier-than-thou-four-glasses-of-cheap-red-in-the-gullet manor, puts his hand on my shoulder and says  they know pain )...at least you are fucking competitive.  My team hasn't won two games in a row since April.  They've won 17 games out of 59.  Today, they lost to the Detroit Tigers.  The 15-40 Detroit Tigers.  The laughingstocks of baseball Detroit Tigers.  The shit ass bitch cunt fucking bitch fuck bitch fuck bitch fuck fuck fuck fuck Detroit Tigers.  The pitcher who lost?  Brian Lawrence.  He was working on a complete game at the time...eight innings of four-hit baseball, before giving up three runs in the ninth.  That would be bad luck to lose, except  the last time he started, he lost a three-hit shutout in the ninth by giving up three runs .  Two complete game shutouts working, and fucknuts loses the games in the ninth.  Not even against good hitting.  Against terrible teams.  The two teams to rally for three runs against my formerly favorite Padre pitcher:  the Brewers and the Tigers.  The other two worst teams in baseball.  My fucking god, this wasteland of cum infested shit the San Diego fucktoys call baseball will send me to the fucking grave.  Fuck.    Sosa corks his bat.  That sucks.  My team can't win a damn game agains the Detroit Bitch Tits in the ninth when their best pitcher is on the mound.  Give me the corked guy.  You cheer for the team that can't beat baseball's worst team.  The feeling is reminiscent of Dana Beyert's refusal of my advances circa March 2002.    I watched a great movie tonight,  urlLink A Face in the Crowd .  This is the movie that Bob Foshko told me to watch months ago in conjunction with my screenplay at the time.  Andy Griffith plays a hobo-gone-media superstar who gets drunk on his ability to greatly influence the American Public.  Among other things, this is the first movie I can think of where Andy Griffith and Walter Matthau play competing heartthrobs, making the heroine's indecision on who to chose that much easier to accept.    Frank (the step-grandfather) and I were at the gym a few days ago, soaking in the heated outdoor pool I oft use as catharsis.   When I was younger,  he said, moving his arms back and forth to "increase blood flow,"  my grandfather would spend time with us by sitting in the reclining chair and falling asleep.  And I figured that this man only thought old thoughts...he didn't come outside, he didn't help with dinner...he woke up late and went to bed early.  But I'm 75, and I don't have old thoughts, at least I don't think so.  I still think like I used to.   It's tough for me to get into old movies.  They move a lot quicker and usually a lot better than contemporary films, but the good movies have the good lines, and the good lines are nothing more than quick cliches used by guys with feelings at frat parties who think that their feelings will get them some stank on the hang-low.  But the more I watch older movies, the more I am impressed with their blatant honesty about situations.   A Face in the Crowd  takes a hard look at the advertising industry, showing many reasons that media (specifically visual media) can abuse the trust people put in it.  Television has the ability to influence without prejudice, and infulence without fact.  If the ad wizards can lie, who can't?  The political commentary towards the end of the movie is eerily reminiscent of one Texan's 2000 presidential campaign.  It's a smart critique of a power few people at the time understood, and an omen of the future of a media that works to herd people into thoughts.  There were three channels at the time of the film.  There are five major media conglomerates today.  Those five can each now own up to half of the media rights in a city.  Thank you for providing us choices, Michael Powell.    Fuck the Padres.  I'm pissed.
