I can only get on the internet twice a week and i dont think these computers have msn. i might bring back sum coins and notes but i don't know if i can because i dont have much money to begin with.......     Anyway, I'll c u l8r, and i use the gmail account for thing that are important. the hotmail is for emailing u guys and for msn.     cya   Darien
