I started a meme ( urlLink definition )(I think)   Correction  I was wrong  urlLink Caroline  informs me that she picked it up from  urlLink Carson , I think I remember reading it once from  urlLink Kottke  or a link from there, but in a different context. I did not know that  urlLink Carson  said it, but him saying it means it is 30% more stylish, I apologise here is the rest of this point as it was before.  I said "Heart" a few times to  urlLink Caroline  and then she started to say it. Her saying it started  urlLink Jenny  saying it. I wonder how far it will go.   3.   urlLink I   Hate You    So Much    Right Now    4.  I heart  urlLink  Carnival Town  by  urlLink Norah Jones    5.  I discovered how to link to songs in  urlLink iTunes  (see carnival town links). Want to do it too? Go to www.apple.com/itunes/linkmaker/ I had it linked before but for somereason it changed the address and directed it to a 404 error. It added "http://blogger.com/lofi/" to the beginning of it so if anyone (IE you  urlLink Caroline  or  Luke ) knows how to fix this give me a hollar in the comments section.   6.  I am getting bloody good at this  urlLink linking  thing   7.  I got 16 links in this entry, do I rock or do I  urlLink rock ? Make that 17!  That Is All
