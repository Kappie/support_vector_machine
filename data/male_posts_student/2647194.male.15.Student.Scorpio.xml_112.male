Plus it's only a half-day thing, so that means almost a 2-hour bus ride home sometimes. Then I have to walk for like 40 minutes from the park and ride. I mean, I like mass transit, but geez.  Band was really hot tonight...hot and really sweaty, plus there's 3 new tunes we have to learn. Not too hard, but field shows start soon, and that's not all that easy I think.  The last 4 weeks in August I have off, so I'm volunteering all of my time during the week towards the Kerry/Edwards campaign at the campaign Headquarters in St. Paul. Phonecalls, being a gopher, envelopes, helping people out, etc. More people should do that-anything to get the monkey out of the White House. There's an overwhelming supply of volunteer's, but that's not a surprise. More than the majority of Americans want him out of office. As I've said before, what's worse: 1. Lying about having a sexual affair in the White House with an intern 2. Lying about various things, such as Weapons of Mass Destruction and uranium from Africa, just to attempt to build a case for war against a country that had absolutely nothing to do with the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and thus killing thousands upon thousands of innocent people, including countless American soldiers.  Again, I think the choice should be clear, just because the latter includes "loss of human life, which is a precious thing". I mean, come on. Who honestly cares if a president has sex with an intern? If that was enough to impeach a president, then Bush should be, well, impeached 20 times over. Impeached 20 times over and thrown into the street in front of a Kerry/Edwards-occupied White House and beaten by a mob of angry average Americans. Oh, and that time, there wouldn't be any of Daddy's Friends around to help him. Ideally, they would all be either gone and resigned, or in the street with the bloody bastard himself.
