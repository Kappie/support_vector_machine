Our young people lives in a country progressing capitalism and have tried to assert thier rights. any of nations does not has a perfection. Many kinds of dreams, movies arts, sounds and letters attand to come at a pasadise but we r not to live in.  That 's not logical procedure in a computer system and similar to a case of reading one's palm and physiognomy then haing guessed one's charactor.
