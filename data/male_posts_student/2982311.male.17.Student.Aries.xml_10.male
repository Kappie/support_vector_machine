The True Story of the Wanderer-formerly know as "Butterfly Catching" this story is finished!-that still doesn't mean that i'm satisfied with it though, i wan tto re-work it alot but it can wait  Parain sword-still don't know if it will be set in the dark ages or fuedal Japan, but i'm thinking dark ages (that makes 3 in that time period) this one is probably going to end up getting combined with Omen Sword  and of course  Omen Sword-i have some key elements for it, but i haven't though about this one much yet, the idea just came to me this morning   i sure do have my work cu tout for me, don't i?
