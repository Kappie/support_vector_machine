Come on, you have enough brains to go toa toilet but not enough brains to flush? Then you may as well just go and answer the call of nature when it calls, regardless of where you are, who is with you etc. The next time you enter a dirty toilet, don't you dare complain because you did EXACTLY the same thing too...  Phew.. been waiting to get that out for some time.... a silly rant but at least I gota say on that.... the toilets are bad enough dirty, but smoking in toilets? These people are inconsiderate. What about people who are non-smoking? What do we do about people who smoke in toilets? Go up to them to tell them politely not to smoke and risk getting our heads busted? If that happens, the person who got his/her headbusted will probably get comments from people, e.g. Why did you go and mind other people's business? Don't you know how to keep your mouth shut?  Hello, it's my life you are talking about here. If you want to smoke your life away, I couldn't care less, but please be a bit more considerate about other people. As they say, one man's meat is another man's poison. What's good for you may not necessarily be good for someone else. Think about it.
