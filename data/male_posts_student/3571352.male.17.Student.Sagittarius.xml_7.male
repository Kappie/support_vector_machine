From just reading this it has what Microsoft Office has and more! If you are big on free I would definitely check this out!  ---------------------------   Keep your computer in tip-top shape!   While browsing the internet I have compile some links that will keep your computer in it's fittest form. The next time you get up and use your computer, it may be feel like you just formatted!   Anti-Virus :  This is a very crucial part of your system! No computer should be without an anti-virus, especially when using P2P software or continuously connected to a broadband connection.  In my opinion  urlLink Avast! Anti-Virus  is the best Anti-Virus to use. It automatically scans incoming e-mails (when using Outlook or Outlook Express) and downloads. This can be considered the bouncer of viruses because if you have it enabled... you should not get any viruses what so ever infecting your system.  Home Edition:  FREE  Professional: $39.99   urlLink Norton Anti-Virus  is my runner up for Anti-Virus programs. Price: $50  I know what you are saying... "I don't want to put out $50 for an anti-virus software that will have to be bought every year". I don't blame you! Because there are some free solutions out there for your protection.  urlLink AVG Antivirus  and  urlLink Avast! Home Edition  are free for personal use, business use you have to pay for. I myself have not use this, but ANY anti-virus is better than not having any! I looked at it and it seems to do the same things as Norton but in a free personal edition version.    De-fragging :  People are always telling you to defrag your computer to keep it optimized... but how can you remember this?? When you do remember it is always when you have to do something! Plus Window's built in defragger doesn't always work to its full potential. There is a software out there that can automatically schedule or sense when your hard disk needs defragging! It is called Diskeeper. The price is $34.95 on CD-ROM or $29.95 download. There is a free Version out called  urlLink Diskeeper Lite  . It has the same powerful defragger but without the scheduling or automatic defragging process.   Spyware :  This is a big problem on systems that can not only slow down your computer but send personal information out to large companies such as web-pages you visit and what you do on the internet. This can be in different forms... cookies.... software... p2p software. To protect yourself I would recommend these FREE TOOLS  urlLink SpyBot Search and Destroy  or  urlLink Ad-aware . If you never ran one of these programs you should... you will be surprised what is on your system!  I hope this software will keep your system optimized and keep your computer running longer before formatting again!  Enjoy!
