I'm eating one of those microwavable chicken bowls from Superstore, and the only thing I'm finding worthy of entering my body is the chicken, but the "chicken" bowl is mostly comprised of gross noodles. How quaint.  The other night, I wentout. A night on the town, it was supposed to be. With Ashlyn and Danielle. Sadly, I got seperated from them after only a short while at Bellini's, and ended up at Club Xtatic with Bryce. I'm sorry, but there's just something about watching girls dance around naked and throwing quarters at them that doesn't really make me think "hey, this is a good time. Yes. I'm having a good time". A beautiful woman is to be held and cared for. A beautiful woman is not a play-thing for you. Boys are stupid.  A note about Bellini's. It was the first time I had ever been in there, and I really did enjoy it. There was still decent music, ladies, dancing, and all that jazz, but it was a better atmosphere. Sure, there were a lot of old people there, but I think that's what made it good, it wasn't all beautiful people, it wasn't all young people, it was just people. People out to have a good time. I'm just out to have a good time.     When people are young, they are so full of life, so full of talent and beauty. I was reminded of this truth last night, in a few ways. I was at my old high school, for their production of "Village of Idiots", which my brother is in. I was reminded of the fun had and the friends made there. The same art is hanging in the hallways. Something seen every day by so many is probably long forgotten by the artist. I couldn't help but wonder if that artist still paints, if they're still involved in the creative process. Did they continue doing what they were good at and what they loved? Or did they simply become working drones, letting that creative flame get snuffed out by the harsh winds of the world? I'm willing to bet the case is similar to the latter.  As I sat down in my chair, my grade seven bus driver was sitting beside me. I've always thought that everyone should be just like her. She is one of the happiest, friendliest people I know. She was always in such good mood when I would ride to and from school every day. I started to talk to her, and she said she wanted to let me know that she appreciated the articles I used to write in the local newspaper. It's so great to see people say what they think. Especially young people. She said. I got to thinking about all of the things I had written about during the final years of my school career. Everyone seemed to enjoy what I was writing, even if they didn't always agree. Again, I began to think about talents, and how passionate we are about everything when we are young. So many people lose that when they graduate and go out into the world. I've lost it, I can't write anymore. I read back over this blog, and there is so much crap on here, despite my best efforts, nothing works, it's gone, and I don't know how to get it back. You have to do what you love, otherwise, what is the point in living?  The play started, and this subject was on my mind for the entire night. So many gifted actors, my brother included. But what is to become of them? What is to become of these gifts they have? Maybe life really does end after high school. I'm sure the best day of my life has already passed, as most of the people I know have probably already experienced the moment when they will be happiest. It's sad. This kind of world, where it's a sin to be creative, it's taboo to do what  you  want to do. I don't want this kind of world.  So. I pray you, continue doing what you love and what you're gifted at. Don't ever stop. Don't let it stop....
