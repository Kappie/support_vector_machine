You guys should know that everyone wakes up later the usual on a Sunday, my family no droudt is the same. Well of cause I would be the only one awake then, doing my business, washing my face and brushing my teeth. There wasn't any nice shows on the TV listing, so I hopped right back into bed or rather onto mattress and tune in to Power 98 fm on my Baby T (hand phone). Next thing I know, my Lao Er tripped over my hands free bringing my poor Baby T all the way down from above my PC Tower. Poor old Baby T, nothing seems wrong until I gave Tara a call later on. I couldn’t end the call. I restarted her and it seems to be working just fine, fingers crossed.   After a buffet of anime, I had porridge for lunch. Here’s where the fun part starts. With the upgrading going according to schedule, the worker will be coming into our house in the coming few weeks. That’s why my dad thought of wrecking their bed, and kind of rearranging some of the stuff. The bed sure is old, but the wood used to make it sure are some tough nut to crack. It won’t be so troublesome if we were to have a set of Allen keys (is that how you spell it?). Bed 'dissected' and I discovered some chalk creation underneath one of the wooden plank, I wasn’t done by me, so what’s your guess? HEhee… all the while I thought I was strong until I tried to carry the piece of wood to dump. The pieces were so heavy and huge, I lost balance somewhere down the stair and nearly topple over. PhewP~ close call there.  We moved all the furniture away from the windows which worker will be bringing down soon. Mum  dad will be sleeping on mattress from now on. I grew bored after all the moving, so I started on my gundam modifying again. It didn’t go too well, like I said, it was messy. It was fun trying it out again anyway. Pretty soon it was dinner, and I threw all the food back down into my throat as usual.
