I thought Keane "slept in" again this week, since I didn't see him in the morning. As for paragraphs... surely you know some HTML ne? Use open-caret - p - close-caret, carets being those triangly brackets above the comma and period.   Anyhows, yesterday was pretty fun, after duelling a bit, I went skating then came back home to play Warcraft (with Eric laughing at my n00bism).    And today... should be interesting... unfortunately I forgot to reconfirm with 4 people... ^^;; they better come anyways *glares*. Ah... a new low: 2 people on messenger out of 50-something?? wtfruit..? Ah wellll...   ~Chronos
