Walked right out and trekked behind Mandrin gardens, we went through the underpass on to east coast, stopped for a break halfway cos kel had to change his pants, then we continued…there was a fire in the forest or something, there was this fire truck and lots of smoke, and two men, I wonder what that means. So we went on till we came upon a marsh. A BLOODY DIRTY, ICKY, SQUISHY, MARSH. It was hilarious! Kel had his slipper, or rather ryans slipper stuck on the mud and he was holding on to me and laughing, trying to retrieve it and in the end both his slippers got stuck, haha we kept on laughing. Ryan was the first to get cross it cos of his weird technique of jumping from one tree root to another. Daniel was somewhere figuring out how to go cross it. Kel was the second one and the one that was most covered with mud, haha he just walked straight through it barefooted cos he said hes got nothing to lose. After a while Dan said screw it cos two dogs were advancing towards us very slowly, and they almost bit him. Heh. So he took of his shoes and socks and crossed the marsh, so did I but I kinda used ryans method - it worked! But I was till covered with shit. Thank god we found this construction workers kinda place, it had a hose in it, and a fan in the guardroom or something. I had to climb in through the window with the help of ryan and kick the door open cos it was jammed or something. We washed up and got really wasted and stuff cos we smell of mud and our shoes we soaked in it. And we were uhh..one hour behind schedule. Heheh. We took off half an hour later, walking on the highway and finally, we reached Benjamin Sheares bridge, yay! Hahah, found a nice place to sit and had our snacks and stuff, budget dinner they call it. We had very little water left and all of us were thirsty like camels, or was it just me? Hmmm….like an hour later when the sky got darker we could see the national day fireworks, together with a lot of people who came too. Heh.we left for Suntec at 8 and changed into warmer, dryer clothing. Had our dinner and watched the village. BRYCE DALLAS HOWARDS is damn pretty!! Ahhhhh. Went back after that and my legs were aching like crazy. My sis was running a high fever, so I followed her and her bf to the hospital, waiting for about 2 hours ++, thanks hui for talking to me heh. Was hungry, tired and sticky, I didn’t even take a bath yet! Doh. Reached home around 3 and I took a nice warm shower, wanted to go grab something but I was too bloody tired, collapsed in bed and had yet another weird dream that im hesitant to describe, heh, ciao.
