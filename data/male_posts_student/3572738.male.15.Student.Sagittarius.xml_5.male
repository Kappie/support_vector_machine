I've been playing guitar and bass for about three hours straight now. I realised how much Queen truly rocks. I mean who really cares Freddy Mercury was gay, he was an amazing singer and a cool dude. So I sort of got kicked out of science but not really and went to the cafeteria and hung out. There's one really annoying kid that was with us but he sucks. I had fun anyway because I ate chips and learned. Its annoying how you know the material but they have to spend about 7 classes going over it and giving you assignments that just waste your time. What's the deal. Ooh I found the most heinous pen in the world. It's about 11  inches in height coloured like an american flag and at the top is lady liberty. It's not a pen it's an eyesore. I also had a talk about my karmic beliefs with two people who could not just go with me and I got highly frustrated. If you read this you two this is me glaring. *evil eyes* Yeah so that's my day in a nutshell. Fairly uneventful yet still fairly entertaining. -Gavin I made a cool song about a blueberry muffin. Totally sexy and svelte.
