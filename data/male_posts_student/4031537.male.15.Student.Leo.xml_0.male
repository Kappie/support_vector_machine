Well I would not call it a horrible day. The day wasn't without its high lights. School  was  bearable. Crazy Eights every recess and lunch gets more exciting with every game. But on the flipside, the teacher was not.       My Careers teacher is  so  annoying.       She's a great teacher, I mean sometimes she can be very interesting, but most of the time, she fails to make me ask for an encore. She's not only a depressing teacher (who excites her students, then tell them they are only taking notes), but she is also a very uptight teacher. But hey, that's all I'm going to say about her personally. It's my last day of school tomorrow =D.       The last day of school, however mgith end up being the worst of all days. I, along with the other 18 students, will be interviewed by her. By her.  By her.  And then the possible 4 hour exam review starts. I, along with her other 18 students, will have to be subjected to her droning.       Bring on the rain.
