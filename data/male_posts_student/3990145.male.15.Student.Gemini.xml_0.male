But nevermind, cause by getting all C and above I can get a Gold!~ But it isn't very "smooth" for my other stations... I got 40 for sit and reach, for this one I am not sure what grade I got... I got A for my sit-ups and chin-up, 43 and 13 respectively. But I actually failed my standing board jump!! I only manage to get 190 cm~!! But that teacher was some what "cockeye". He rounded everyone's actual readings by 10 to 20 cm!!... Nevermind... I can do a re-test doing my next PE lesson...            Arrrr.. Its going to be the 2.4 km run on Thursday... That's really scarly... For the pass 2 years, I have been getting timings like 13:35 minutes. But in order to get C, I think a 12:10 is needed... Aw man... This is going to be hard for me... But nevermind!! I will just try my best!! Among all my tests, seriously I think chin up is the most easy to score A... Wahahahaha~~! Ok its time to sleep~ there is still school tomorrow~!!!
