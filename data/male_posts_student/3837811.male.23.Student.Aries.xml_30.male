I cant imagine, so its a small price to pay.. lol  Before Survivor came out, there's no such ting as reality tv... Or i can say, nothing interesting to watch, lol... I can still remember TV without cable, shows like Growing Up, Comedy Night, Huan Dao Zhui Zhui Zhui and SBC/TCS Drama Series filled my days...  But once Survivor came out during the first season, i was really into Reality Tv Stuffs... And all the reality tv shows start popping out, Amazing Race, Fear Factor, American Idol, Bachelor etc...... I was totally glued to such shows during their first season, but my interest faded away, like Under One Roof, from second season on... Coz everyting seems the same to me, but now there's gonna be Singapore Idol, someting similar, yet different, coz its Singaporeans, so be sure that im catching the show...  Anyway I've just discovered a new reality tv show on MtvSEA Viva La Bam, its about this crazy guy, who always disturbs and teases his parents, in little tings and in big tings.. And i cant believe it when i watched it for the first time just now... This episode, he tried to make his dad become totally pissed-off, but failed, coz surprisingly, his dad took it really well... Haha cant believe such parents existed...   1st plan:  He bought hundreds of iron on pictures of burgers, coz he said that his dad loves eating burgers, and iron the picture on ALL of his dad's shirt and pants..  Reaction:  His dad couldnt care less, put on the shirt and pants as usual although he saw the burger ironed on his shirt and pants.. lol   2nd plan:  He used a jacksaw to cut up a hole in the middle of his bedroom floor, and when his parents asked what was he doing, he said that he wants a fire pole attached from his room to the first level...  Reaction:  His parents couldnt care less either, and let him did the fire pole up, his dad played with the fire pole somemore, loves it too!   3rd plan:  He inserted grounded beef into his dad's toothpaste tube, so when his dad brushes his teeth, beef is squeezed out onto his toothbrush! EEK  Reaction:  It tasted like beef jerky, *rinses his mouth*   4th plan:  He drove his dad's favourite van out, and totally wrecked it.. But he did buy a new vehicle for his dad  Reaction:  Oh my god.. Its my favourite van.... Oh u bought me another vehicle? Thank u son.......   5th plan:  Treated his parents to an vacation out of town, and while they are away, built a skate-park inside the house, YES, INSIDE the house!      Reaction:  (While his son is skateboarding  inside  the house) Way to go son!! *Claps*  Can u believe his parents? If i do someting like cutting one of my parents' favourite shirts, im dead, not to mention ironing pictures on all their shirts.. lol.. Next episode he will try to do someting crazy again, hahaha nice show.... Love it!   Current Mood: TV!!!   Current Music: Ai Cheng - Xiang Ni De Tian Kong
