It was the premiere of the Real World Movie...  First, lets think about those words alone: The Real World is a show just about "real" people living in a city, in a huge house, with lots of money, an important job, and cameras all around......  What the hell is real about that?  Anyway, the Movie is a fake show about a fake "real" life.  I was thinking about this late at night for about 3 hours...  I think I'm the only person who's ever survived a triple aneurysm.  The entire concept is scary and forced, but eventually, it gets better.  Some of them die...  Besides MTV sending this generation into a void of marketing schemes and the same old songs over and over, my remaining gripes (because I'm such a happy person...) are with Nickelodeon, PAX, about all the talk shows, HBO, Fox, NBC, MSNBC, and by now you can tell that I've been watching too much TV......  I should go do something....
