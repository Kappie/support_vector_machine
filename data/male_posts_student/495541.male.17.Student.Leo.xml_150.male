Nothing bad really happened.  Last basketball practice was today.  It went alright.  Few times I got frustrated but that's pretty normal.  I'm pretty much just glad it's over.  Now I can finally relax and  maybe catch up on some sleep.  I can't wait.  Tomorrow is Friday and Fridays are always good.  I enjoy weekends very much.  Tomorrow is a big day though because I have to have all my project done and ready to present by 7 AM tomorrow.  It's too bad there's a 0 hour class or otherwise I'd be fine.  I just have to take in my mouse and basically set it up by the display.  Pretty easy but oh well.  That's about it.  Night.
