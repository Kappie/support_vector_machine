Just move your mouse over the font to see a different color, I'm contimplating doing the same for the font too so it changes the font but ya never know. So far though I just woke up after my two sisters and the stupid dog that my sister has here were playing 'Who can be the loudest, stupidest idiot' game. I swear if there was a prize for that they'd have it.... The Darwin awards aren't even bad enough at times for them.  I just found out that one of my friends started her own blog, she hasn't gave me the address to it though... Though she did read me some of what was in it, the part about me. She starts school [high school] tomorrow, which is just so wrong cause it is summer still, I mean! I don't even start school til around Sept 5th or 10th! This is so early! Hehe.  Does anybody know how shyty minimum wage is!? 7.05$ an hour! Holy Cow! You cannot even live on that! Jan 1st we are supposed to have min wage bumped to 7.25$ an hour, which is easier but still it is not enough to live off! I mean come on! My car takes like 30-50$ to fill it and I don't even have car payments and it is rough to get by. Get my first pay check on Thurs. though... Working 4 days straight though so the one after will be a pretty good sized check at least, still not 40 hrs a week though. Maybe I should try and get the Desktop publishing job that my Mom found, I'll look into it.  ~ Falcion ~ Rithem ~ O'Brien Bashir ~ ~~ Brian H.
