But here are some great Canadian jokes to ponder while I'm gone:  * What is the definition of a Canadian?  - A disarmed American with health care.   * How do you get 50 Canadians out of a swimming pool?  - Say: "Could you please get out of the pool?"   * An Englishman, an American, and a Canadian were at a pub, and each ordered a Labatt Blue. At exactly the same time, a fly landed in each of the man's beer. The Englishman pushed his Labatt away in disgust. The American picked the fly out of his beer and continued to drink. The Canadian picked the fly out of his beer too, and then he pinched it and started screaming at the top of his lungs: "SPIT IT OUT! SPIT IT OUT YOU MISERABLE BEAST!"   *You might be a Newfie Jedi if...  - You use your light saber to quarter moose. - You have heard the words, "May the force be witt ya by'!" - You eat bottled ewok. - Even C3-PO has no freeking clue what you are saying. - Your father has said to you: "Come on by' son, come on over 'ere to the dark side there and have a Labatt witt yer old man there." - Chewbacca leads your dog sled team with honour. - Your jedi robe is made of seal skin.   * You know you're a Canuck when...  - You design your Hallowe'en costume to fit over a snowsuit. - You understand: "Could you please pass me a serviette, I just spilled my poutine." - You dismiss all beers under 6% as "for children and the enderly... and for export to the US." - You have more miles on your snowblower than your car. - Your fridge is filled with  bags  of milk. - You spent last May 2-4 lounging on your chesterfield watching the Stanley Cup playoffs. - You have to go back inside because you forgot your toque, eh.   That's it there, eh.
