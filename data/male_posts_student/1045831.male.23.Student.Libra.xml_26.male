Got over my pink eye, still got the sniffles but I can deal with that...  Got to deal with West Civ. as usual...  Ohh I am going to apply to bartend at the Bottleneck which would end up being a very cool job.  Lots of great bands coming through there..  And also going to see Jason Boland and the Stragglers tonight which will be fun...   Other than that not much going on.. So i'm off to get in the shower and in the words of Henry Hyde, "The statute of limitations has long since passes on my youthful indescretions."  Probably doesn't apply to me but I liked the way it sounded..  Peace out folks and if ya believe in the man upstairs maybe give him a shout out for me and see if he'll help with the job..
