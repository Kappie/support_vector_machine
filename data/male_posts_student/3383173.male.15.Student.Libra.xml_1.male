I did not and will not target special Nepher. I merely tried to tell her that she’s the only one who can prevent Ryuzuki from snapping and bringing my destructive fury into life. I didn’t mean for her to get hurt, however and whenever it may have happened. I’m sorry if you thought I’d hurt her. I am the angel of death, I admit countless men and women have died at my hands, but I am always accompanied by justice. I do not strike down those who are innocent, no matter how mad I am at them. I guess that just got stronger with Ryuzuki’s feelings towards Sakura. As for Tyr, Ryuzuki asked a little favor from him which I approved of, if ever I get out of control. Tyr will do all that it takes to stop me, because right now I know of only three entities besides Ryuzuki who can control me: you, Tyr, and Oria. I’m actually happy that Ryuzuki was open enough to share his body with me.  By the way, Sese, why did you forget about me? (Well, I never gave you my name before, so that might have been my fault.) I never knew you’d take Sese as your name in this lifetime.   It’s ironic that the twins get us as their reincarnated guardians. Honestly, I like protecting this kid, no matter how wimpy or cowardly he might be. He’s quite intelligent when he wants to be, and he already has good morals for his age. Although when his dad dies, he’ll be the last living person on this earth who has the capacity to become me, the angel of death, incarnate. I’m training him already, although at times your ward gets into the way of his training, but I have to admit, without her, he’d already be dead a month ago .  I missed you, Sese. I miss those days when we worked together as partners. Queerly enough, Sakura told Ryuzuki that you were reawakened by these little tidbits I can generate by tapping into Ryuzuki’s body. Did you really forget me? Maybe we’ll just find out when we talk tomorrow. I’m sorry if Ryuzuki seemed too worthless when you talked to him a while ago, I’ll make up for that. He sometimes forgets his manners around someone he supposedly knows very well.  Did I mention just how special this kid is? He’s been favored by my two sisters, the angels of life and live, and he’s blessed by the Egyptian god  Ra . If you don’t believe me, ask him to show you his right hand when you talk to him. If you can still read katakana, you’ll find something very interesting on his hand. He’s constantly in good health, and he never gets hurt by love. Besides, he already found Sakura. According to him, he doesn’t care if he never gets someone he can call his own, as long as Sakura is there. He cares a lot for her, and I don’t want to hurt him or Sakura because of that. Ask him yourself, if you wish. He actually does things he’d never to with other girls with her, like sing, try to dance, and show her just how much he really tries at stuff. Don’t worry about her getting hurt by him or me, since I can’t hurt her or you, and you know that. I’m really sorry if you thought I would hurt her, even in my full glory I will not try to. I am still of God, and as long as you both are, you can expect me to protect you instead of hurting you.   (Shi wa Tenshi)
