I am filled with wonderment to find out if Scott Parker received my note, but I guess I will never know, never that is, until I break into his house and ask him at gunpoint. Charlton lost yesterday, so my weekend was filled with unhappiness, but I will live through this week safely in the knowledge that next week the long awaited Easter break starts. Hoooray!
