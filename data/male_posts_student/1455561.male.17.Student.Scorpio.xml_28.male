He's invited everyone to the cinema to see lord of the rings but decided he would book the 8pm sunday performance cos he thought no one would be busy then.  he's is right, no once is doing anything then because NO ONE WANTS TO BE DOING ANYTHING.  so i am going to see lord of the rings with the sort of people who will probably dress up as gandalf, on sunday night, to see a fantasy film, with me having nosebleeds.  maybe im turning into one of them: i feel dirty, need to get drunk very quickly.  "cress, too tempting even for jesus"  anyway, i would write merry christmas but frankly i'd rather you didnt have one.  i know the sort of people who read these things, cant even write their own so have to read someone elses.  probably reading this on a sunny day, look at yourself. LOOK HARD.
