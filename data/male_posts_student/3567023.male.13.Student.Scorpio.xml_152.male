Heh I was looking at an article yesterday, it was telling how Christians are prejudice bastards and how much we should hate them...Is it just me or does this evolutionist sound like Kerry or one of our senators? It does to me, our whole entire country is messed up. I hate it here but I am grateful for all I have, I may not like our president but I can clearly see that Kerry isn't going to win by great speeches and persuasion, he's going to win cause people hate Bush. To me that is not the marking of a good president. But we all know who are going to win, we all know how much everyone hates Bush. "OMG the economy is down and gas prices are up". The economy is run by people if we go to war and people freak out and take out all their stocks that's their problem, if Texco wants to be a butt and raise the prices to make more money that's their problem. The least you can do is not blame EVERY SINGLE FREAKING PROBLEM on Bush. You can hate him as much as you want, but I doubt if you had the chance to take down Saddam in Iraq you would let it pass. I for one know I wouldn't I attack them whether you like it or not. I would get on TV and announce it to the world that I'm going to take that dirty bastard down no matter what, even if it involves getting impeached. Then you have the fact that pacifist are say we are killing innocent women and children. I had a friend who went to Iraq, do you know who what the scariest thing there? It was the woman, it's because the woman wear the long garments and since you would violate the religion by searching at woman, it is possible for them to hide weapons in their garments. And the children are given guns and told to shoot at soldiers and it is mandatory in the US Army that if you are shot at you shoot back. So we kill these children and women and we are accused of bloody murder and that we are so cold hearted that we shoot children and women. Meh...We have soldiers that are women in Iraq, they are getting shot at. At least America has some dignity and does not use this as an excuse to say they are bloody murderers. Then we have people who compare Iraq to Vietnam. Vietnam was one of the worst wars in the history of the US we tried and we failed. Vietnam was possibly a worse war for the US than WW2 cause we had the draft and we lost men in gruesome ways. This is nothing like Vietnam. I know this will sound cruel but if I had to I would shoot women and children if they were jeopardizing other people. What can I say I have a black heart, I could kill my brother or sister without flinching, I've tried. I threw a knife at him but it didn't hit him. I haven't even felt a pang of sorrow about that day, there is not a moment when I feel guilty. I've lost it all. I couldn't care less if Bush was murdered, or if Kerry died in a car crash. I couldn't care less if you took away my computer. I couldn't care less if you banned me from reading. I don't care about anything anymore. I take one look at the country and people around me and I'm ashamed of it. I want out I want to just not be here. I have no passion, no hopes, and no dreams. I'm sick of all of it. I'm sick of the Republicans and the Democrats, I'm sick of the Christians and the Evolutionist, I'm sick of the Gays and the Straights, I'm sick of all the arguments between these people. This quote carries alot of weight in the real world...Veritas odium parit...   Audentes Fortuna Juvat Ave atque vale Nathan
