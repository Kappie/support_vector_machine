I never get tired of Celebrity Jeopardy on SNL....I have all of the skits on my winamp playlist and I always laugh at them....it never fails....  Mike Tyson is also a reliable source of humor...."my style is impetuous, my defense is impregnable, I want to eat his children, praise be to Allah", you couldn't assemble a team of Hollywood writers anywhere to come up with something so ridiculously funny....  So I am sitting minding my own business when "I Really Like It" by Harlem World comes on....it was one of those moments where I questioned my own sanity....why did I download that song??....then Baby Stase's verse comes on and I'm redeemed....  I strongly considered deleting all of my R. Kelly songs after hearing about what he allegedly (and I only use that word because he hasn't been convicted yet) did to those poor little girls....R. Kelly is worse than Osama Bin Laden....I will not argue this point....  Anyway that's enough for now....
