I thought everything was so cool there, and it worked out great. Our hotel was super super awesome! Erica im so sorry i didnt call you on the last night. I was out in the lobby till like 3. I hated that one skit though about the v space crap. Omg if you guys heard someone say: yeah!!" a bunch of times, that was lil old Micah. lol. Jen left for California today. I think that was one of the hardest things to do, say goodbye to her. When i got on our shuttle bus after i said goodbye, all the guys were just looking at me. I could tell they didnt know what to say. Steve Morrill is so extremely nice though.  Oh and im just feeling like crap. You guys, i have never felt this way ever before. I hate it with a passion. I am not going to write it online though. I just feel like my world is going to end tomorrow. I dunno ill talk to you about it later. Im glad i got to see you all in Orlando though!! I made sure to see all of you. I love you guys! Love, Rachael P.S.~ did i mention that orlando was freaking awesome? it sucks to be in Saginaw now. It went by so fast.
