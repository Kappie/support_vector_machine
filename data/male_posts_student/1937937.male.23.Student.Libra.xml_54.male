There's something strange about getting up, isn't there?  Some people have no problem doing it; others spend their entire lives struggling against the alarm clock.  I love the way morning feels one I'm in it, but getting myself to be in it is a real pain.  Maybe I'll turn this website into my very own personal Sleep Diary  urlLink [The National Sleep Foundation] .  That way, anyone who stumbles across it will be utterly captivated, I'm sure.  Example:  10:41 pm - unusual leg movement 11:13 pm - crashing sound woke me up, cat knocked over banjo 02:14 am - anxiety dream woke me up 06:09 am - bird chirping woke me up 06:14 am - DAMN BIRDS 07:02 am - alarm clock  Great idea, isn't it?  Check out this sleep journalists decent into the world of Nyquil:  urlLink [Bobo's Log] .   urlLink [Final Exams from Hell] ... everybody loves 'em.  By the way, have any of you heard of James Kibo Perry  urlLink [Kibo's official site] ?  He's one of the more amusing characters out there.  The lengths that people will go to achieve fame!  I wouldn't know anything about that.
