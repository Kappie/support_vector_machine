There's nothing like a little friendly competition between two companies which hold near-monopolies in their respective fields - Satan's own damnable spawn, Telus, and the exciting as dry toast, Shaw. Whereas Telus maintains it's icy grip on Edmonton's local telephone service, Shaw has engulfed nearly all cable TV providers. High Speed Internet, however, is where these two behemoths battle for supremacy.  Tired of dealing with the "customer service" whores at Telus (and hey, maybe I owed them a bit of money) I decided to give ol' Shaw a call and see if they'd throw a deal my way. Boy was I in luck. Not only do I get a free month and a reduced rate for 6 months, but they personally show up at your door to  smash your Telus ADSL modem into a thousand pieces ! These pieces are then scattered to the four corners of the Earth to quell any lingering  demons  they may have been imbibed with. Burning the modem, however, is not an option as pure evil cannot be incinerated.    Currently: Enjoying a certain degree of satisfaction
