I saw Jennifer's number and asked him whether I can have it. He's cool with that. And I saved her number in my handphone. That very same day, after the game, I decided to sms her. At first I thought she wouldn't reply me back but I was wrong. She did reply me and we keep on sms-ing each other that we get closer as friends. On 14th June 2004, I got this idea of going out with her.. We confirmed on 17th that we'll be going out. From that moment onwards, I felt so great. Get to go out with the girl I was beginning to like. I bought her this Teddy Bear and a handphone initials. As gifts. 17th June 2004, the day.. I go to her block and waited for her. She turned up and we chatted all the way to JP. She wanted to go there and I was cool with it. We chatted in the bus. She was just so adorable. I can't get my eyes off her! When we reached JP, we went to have an early dinner vecause we already bought the tickets to watch "Around The World In 80 Days". We ate slowly and I was observing her eyes all along. Really.. She's so cute.. We stroll around JP while waiting for the movie to start. I buy her this Danish ice-cream and she was like so excited coz' it was kinda big. Hehe! Yup.. We continue to walk and stop upon this shop and we browse inside. She liked this handphone key-chain and I bought it for her even though she insist. I wouldn't mind. I'd do anything for her.. In the theatre, while watching we were so close. She enjoyed the movie. After it, we decided to have a photo taken together.We took one. A Neocard. I hugged her coz' she didn't mind. I felt very fortunate coz' I get to hug her on my first date! How cool was that.?! After all, I send her to her friend's BBQ at West Coast Park. We walked slowly there from JTPS. I wanted to hold her hands but I'm afraid she might not get use to it. Coz' it's too early.. When we stepped up on the entrance of the West Coast Park.. I know it's goodbye. I gave her the gifts I bought her. And we said goodbye... From that moment onwards.. I kept on thinking of her day and night.. Couldn't stop..
