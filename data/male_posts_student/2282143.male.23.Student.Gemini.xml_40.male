So when my dad gets home from work, he hears this wailing and scratching.  Wally has been sitting and scratching at the door, begging for someone to let him back in the house.  Poor little dude was freezing and pissed off at my mom (even though it was his own fault).  Was funny although Im sure the cat didn't share my feelings on the matter.  Anyways, HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY!!!  A few days late, but eh, whatever.  Not like I was here to write it.  Spent the weekend in Michigan, having a great time.  Pics are up on the site.  As usual.  Had a blast and didn't want to leave.  Friday night went out to the Wayside (a bah) and got shitty with a few of Sam's friends.  Met Andi's boyfriend Chris...  Cool guy.  I think we'll all get along.  Good times.  Watched Y tu mama Tambien on Saturday night after a long day of scraping and painting the gas chamber (this room in her basement which is a funky tope color, mildewy and water damaged corner, and looks like a gas chamber, hence the name).  The movie was pretty good.  Very artistic and pretty damn pornographic.  The movie revolved around sexual escapades and didn't quite have the happiest ending, but was a good valentine's movie... for some reasons, anyways...   Took test number 4 this morning in CNA class.  It wasn't that bad, but it sucked because I HATE tests on Monday's...  Just a pain in the butt to ruin a perfectly good weekend by having to study.  Today was really cool though, because my ma showed me all of the stuff that her cousin had compiled on the genealogy of my family.  At least the Scottish side.  So thank you mom's cousin Kevin for doing all the research (he's a writer for the Highlander which I guess is a Scottish magazine, so I would imagine he knows his stuff!).  My grandma's maiden name is Fall, which is Scottish in origin (but from Ireland), while her mother's name was Sparrow (English, but then too, from Ireland).  So Fall was actually traced back to MacPhail (son of Paul) of Clan Chattan, aka Clan of the Cats located at Inverness.  The motto actually is "Touch not the cat bot a glove."  Bot means "without" so its basically "dont fuck with the cats" which I guess is a pretty strong message to anyone who would mess with the clan.  But its cool.  I guess cousin Kevin linked it back to King Egan or something like that, unfortunately I dont have the lineage right in front of me right now and Im too lazy to get it.  It goes all the way up to about the mid 1700's when Sir Andrew MacPhail shook the hand of Bonnie Prince Charlie before moving off to Canada, which I guess means Im a bit Canadian too, but I will have to ask my grandma/mother about the horse raising that side of the fmaily did or something like that...  I digress, so Andrew never greeted anyone with that hand he shook with up till his death.  Crazy stuff.  I also found my tartan, so that means I can wear my colors to my wedding... Or at least I can finally buy a kilt.  Neither of which Sammy approves of.  Oh well.  So  urlLink here is the website for the Clan  and  urlLink this is the MacPhail website .  Very cool stuff.  Check it out if you want to learn more about my lineage.  I was thinking of communicating with the clan, but I kinda feel a bit funny just being like, "Hi, I could be your third cousin 136 times removed!"  Kinda crazy to know that all these people and I share some glimmer of the same genetic material (quite diluted, I know, but still).  Maybe someday I will get the courage to embrace my ancestry.  I think its pretty kick ass to know where you come from.  And if that makes me a big loser, well, its not like I haven't been called that before, so bite me.
