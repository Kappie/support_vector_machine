    
       I want to start a mailing list. Not one of them annoying daily ones with useless long information. Just weekly ones maybe, with short paragraphs that describe my current life. If you want to join, e-mail me and ask to.   I have a feeling no one will.  On an unrelated note, I can be so selfish sometimes. I'm just good at hiding it.   This was one of my more dumb egotistical ideas. Also, I can't hide it anymore.
