I have now clue what happened to begin with, but for the last 1-2 weeks I have had no sound on my computer, even with a pair of new speakers.  To add to that note, I've come across and old site I used to go to. I hope everyone will check it out. If you've been there a while back, please check it out again. It has a new layout. Anyway:  urlLink Where's George  Oh yeah, if you're from Canada, don't forget to check out  urlLink Where's Willy
