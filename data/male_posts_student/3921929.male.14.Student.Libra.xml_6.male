I took the  urlLink Blogging Personality Quiz  at  urlLink About Web logs  and I am...    The Daily Grinder    I love blogging because it's like therapy. I can write about anything and everything that happens to me - from the food I ate to what I was doing when I heard the latest 'breaking news'. Being able to communicate with my friends (online and/or real life) through my blog is important to me.
