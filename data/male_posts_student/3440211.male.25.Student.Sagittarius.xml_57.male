I have left my friends there because I was just too nackered.  In fact I am trying to draw away from them trying to make the final brech as easy as posible. My decission has been taken and its not the first time that I have done so. It just hurts but as brel said... We don't forget anything we just get used to it. My girlfriend is extremely suportive but I know it not easy for her either. She is in a similar situation at the end of the day. I just hope everything goes fine in the end but in life you never know.  Mood: exausted but fine... the day was nice..
