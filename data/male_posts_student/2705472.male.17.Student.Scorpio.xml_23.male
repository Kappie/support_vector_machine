They were sooo annoying. I'm kinda glad they are 6 hours away. Ah Kiersten was so weird and alex was a total nerd. What a disappointment. I kept telling them "oh I wanna come back", but I just wanted to sound nice.                          [/end of joke]  In all seriousness, it was AMAZING. I had sooo much fun. LIKE A BUTT. Now a summary of the trip.  I got up at 9ish on Friday morning, and by 11am, I was sitting on my bed ready to go, however, my mom's boyfriend Tom had to make some conference calls, and we didn't end up leaving until...gasp...1:30pm. It kinda ruined the plans we had for that night, but hey, it was nice enough for Tom to make this trip and he needed to do some business, so I have nothing to complain about. The ride was alright at first. I brought my 20 gig Rio Karma mp3 player with 1900 songs at my disposal for entertainment. So I was entertained pretty well. However, we ran into some trouble when we got to Pittsburgh...we got lost. The MapQuest directions were misleading and semi-wrong, so an extra 90 minutes was added to the trip trying to figure out where we needed to go.  FINALLY we got to the Comfort Inn Hotel at 9:30pm. When I stepped out of the car there, my cell phone vibrates. It was Alex.  A: Guess where I am? J: Uhh I have no idea A: The Comfort Inn  *!!!* = my brain. I got so excited and started looking all around. So we stayed on the phone trying to locate each other. "Get out of your car, "I told him, I still didn't see him. I even got to the point where I was yelling "HELLO" in the parking lot...then we discovered...he was at a different Comfort Inn. HAHA! Boy, that was funny.  So finally Alex got to the right Comfort Inn. I saw a car approaching with a teenager (or peenager). Alex waved. I walked up his window. We shook hands. First contact was established. I then called down mom and tom and introduced alex to them.  I must say, it wasn't as weird as I thought it was gonna be. It's probably cause of the times on the phone or when we would glophone, so I knew what it was like to talk to him. The first couple minutes in the car felt a bit odd, like "holy shit, i'm in the car with acewepeel", but I got used to it kinda fast.  We proceeded to Kiersten's house. It was kinda funny, cause when we pulled into her drive way, there were all these other kids walking down the street, so we joked that they were here to see my arrival. I saw Kiersten coming down the steps and I experienced more *!!!* feelings. So we had another whoaahh this is it kinda moment and we went inside her house to meet her parents. Her parents were pretty nice and welcoming. I tried to be a responsible and friendly kid and apparently I suceeded. I felt like I was on 20/20 being interviewed. We talked about everything from them seeing my movies to the chairs they got 20 years ago. They seemed like normal people, so its kinda hard to imagine all the horror stories about their strict rules are true.  In Peensylvania, their jr. driving license has a curfew of 11pm, which is hella dumb. Ours is 12am. So we didn't have time to go out to eat or anything. Alex drove me back to the hotel, and he picked me up the next morning at 10ish to go to  urlLink Kennywood , the amusement park alex works at. We had some good bonding time together, getting used to each other and such. We arrived there 11am and by the time Kiersten got there after 3pm, I felt pretty normal. None of the roller coasters went upside down, which was kinda disappointing, but the rides were still very fun anyway. We went on the Phantom 4 times, but the 2nd time was absolutely amazing, cause we had the front row and the wind was incredible.  We went on the log jammer twice...here is a pic of that.     I was trying to look at the camera, but oh well.  Then...we DID THE SKYCOASTER. It's basically a bungee swing. Here is a corny pic I found on the internet.      We were all sooo nervous, especially Kiersten, who had this gut feeling that we were gonna die. WHAT AN EXPERIENCE. The initial 2 seconds of the drop are pants-shitting scary. You get to discover what you sound like when you think you are about to die. Then as soon as the wire catches, it is tons of fun and not really stomach dropping.  The 2nd time we ate was really bizarre. We were literally high on life, acting extremely goofy. We played spit-your-ice-into-your-cup, and at the moment, it was the funniest thing in the world. Kiersten even told us a story about how she peed her pants last October. LOL! I doubt she would have told us that story if she was in any other regular mind set. Later that night, we actually almost got her to pee her pants from laughing, to the point where she let go a little and had to crouch down hahahahaha. Aw man, CLASSIC. Sorry Kiersten :)  Now for the really cheesy part. All good things must come to an end. After we did the sky coaster at 10pm, it was time to go. The walk back to the car was depressing. On the ride back, Alex and I sang along to obscure Weezer songs, revealing our awful falsetto skills. It was so much fun doing that with another Weezer nerd haha. Poor Kiersten hehe. We arrived back at the Comfort Inn. It was a tough good bye.  That day I truly learned why Alex and I have been able to keep contact for 2 years and with Kiersten for 1 full year too. They are just like my friends here in Voorhees, and they would fit in perfectly with my group. The transition from internet friend to real life friends was completely easy. I can't say that about the other internet friend I met. They are cool, hilarious people whom I had BLAST with. I only hope they felt the same way, and judging from all the fun we had and the painful goodbye, I know they liked me in someway, hehe. Alex hasn't blocked me on aim yet, so that's a good sign. But its painful to thing that these people that I am so compatible with are 6 hours away, no easy trip. With no one else can I make both an extremely obscure SNL reference and then an obscure Weezer reference within 60 seconds. Ok, now the corny part is done.  I shall post pictures soon. They are currently at rite-aid being developed.
