And that damn Drama exam. (GOD that was embarrassing!) - I am officially a Junior in high school. Yay, team, and all that rot. - I LURVE my new schedule. I have Mr. Davis for 2 consecutive periods. That is a blessing from God! (or maybe a curse from Satan? Time will tell.) And Mrs. Massey. I knew about that, but I'm still overjoyed about it. However, I have my math teacher from Freshman year again. I didn't really like him  then,  why would I now?  Ugh.  - My Drama exam didn't kill me too bad, actually. I still had a high B for the semester. - For Anatomy, I have this über-rightist commando-dude. (The kind that makes us conservatives look bad.) This guy's farther right than me! If there's anything that makes me sick, it's the über-right. I'll be suppressing the gag reflex all year, and it won't be from the dissection labs.   My Schedule  1st - Geometry (Whitman) 2nd - Advanced Drama 2 (Davis) 3rd - AP Language/Compostion (Davis) 4th - AP United States History (Thurman) 5th - Anatomy (Hyde) 6th - AP Psychology (Massey)
