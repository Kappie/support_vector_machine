Doubtless Sam'll be the only person to read this but anyhow I'm going to say that she was very civil today in talking to me so well done her ^_^. Seriously, it's nice when people don't tell you to die. She did subtly say "goodbye" but I'd been intending to go away and stop being a prick so she was quite right to.  I have a depressingly small amount of lines in Pirates.... but who cares about that to be quite frank?  Anyway, if I don't ask Caroline if she's on MSN tomorrow I'll have failed to since very soon after we came back to school... God, I'm sad. Seriously. I don't know, it doesn't even say ANYTHING other than I'd like to talk to her. For crying out loud.  I'm actually really bored, too...  Love, Jon Roskilly
