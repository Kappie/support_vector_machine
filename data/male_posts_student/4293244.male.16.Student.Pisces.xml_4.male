First of all I am not gay but I support gay marriage for one very simple reason, I support the US Constitution. I find it hard to believe that the President who's job in part is to uphold the US Constitution would support a gay marriage ban. Does it not say in the Constitution all men are created equal? So who gets the right to decide that that does not apply to gay marriages but only to marriage between a man and a woman. In a religious aspect of course a church has the right to keep their marriage practices however they like, that's not the issue, it is the state's marriage. Why does there even have to be a separate name for it? These so called "unions" mock the couples and make marriage like a secret club only accessible to people of a certain creed. This is a practice long denounced by the US government and any elected politician who supports ought to be stripped of their title. I don't mean this literally of course, that is just as bad as voting for a gay marriage ban. I also think that it is quite convenient that the moment this thing fell through and did not get the support President Bush hoped for it was neatly swept under the rug. It is time that people stop forgetting an issue once the twenty-four hour news channels stop covering it ten times a day. What is it replaced with? The Peterson case, the Hacking case, the Jackson case? Things of such little relevance. This is an election year and it is time that people start focusing on the issues at hand and not at these little media distractions and war records. The facts are that the records show Kerry winning his medals, wounded three times, in Vietnam and they show Bush absent much of the time from the Air National Guard back home in the states and failing to take a drug test. Those are the facts, get over it and stop worrying, I say that to Democrats too although it should be kept in mind that this man sent us into two countries to fight never having done so himself, which does not make him a bad man but certainly should be taken into account. I would recommend watching the Daily Show, they bring up everything and criticize everyone, the way a real news show ought to be.
