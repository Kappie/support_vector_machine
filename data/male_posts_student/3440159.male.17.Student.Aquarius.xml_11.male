Yep, I sold out and fell victim to the man. (My Mom). She hates long hair. I had to appease her. I got it cut real short, and put some highlights in. Anyway, here is what my hair looked like, and what it looks like now.    Before    After   Nice eh? And because I'm even more conceited, here are more views of my hair:    Front View    Side View    Top View   There... if you didn't have enought pictures of my hair, there it was. Man, I'm really bored... 8:00 couldn't come any slower.  Peace, Cy
