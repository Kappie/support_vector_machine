Friday: My parents left for Reno today. They are at their anniversary getaway. So they left Derek, Chris and I to fend for ourselves. Not that we would need to do any fending, maybe a little cooking, but we aren't a very hostile household. I stayed home from school because I was feeling sick, as you may know already.  I played a lot of Final Fantasy and read a little (wow, if this seems familiar to anyone, just skip on down a few sentences).  If you've decided to skip, then you must start reading here, I mean it. Yea, yea, I know, that was pretty mean. I shouldn't have got your guys' hopes up. You will not be allowed to skip a good chunk of this post. Okay, if you really want to you can. You can skip on down to the next day.  Today: Yea, I did it again. It is kind of fun. Fun like jumping into a pit of alligators. Yea, that could be fun, if you think about it over and over and over again until words lose all meaning. Today was a repeat of yesterday, except I didn't stay home from school. Well, I guess technically I did, but that's only if you want to be all technical. Considering I really was not obligated to go to school, I don't think it counts. I played some more Final Fantasy today. That game is addicting. If you are a gamer like I, you will want to keep advancing in this game. Well, supposedly I am not a gamer since I haven't played Ninja Gadien 1 or 2. Anyways, the Jennings (neighbors) came over for a while and played GBA and a lil' GCN. Good times, good times.  Tomorrow: Believe it or not, I actually have something planned. Don't worry, it wasn't on purpose. I have to watch Chris since we can't get a babysitter tomorrow. So I get to miss church. I don't really want to miss church, but it's not like I am going to be smote (heh, smote) if I don't go. Derek offered to watch Chris after church so I could go over to Jennings. It just depends on if Jordan is over. Wait! Danny just got his appendix removed, Jordan is not going to be there. I don't think I am going to be here tomorrow.   Anyways, fun weekend, can't you tell? The "Site o' the day" is Unkymoods! If you haven't already made the connection, if you click on that little yellow piece of paper with a face and a word (right now it would actually be four words, since the mood happens to be talky), you will get a link to it. Isn't technology great? Well, enjoy. Why do we need to clean behind our ears anyways? Does anybody look there?  Post Script (yes, that is what "P.S." stands for): I seem to be typing a lot better. I am not making many mistakes, and the ones I do are just because the dicitionary doesn't recognize those words.
