I cloned my hard drive onto a 40 GB drive a couple hour ago, so hopefully nothing will be lost when I send in the drive. The odd thing though, is that the symptoms have largely resided. I've gotten a couple bad sectors the past couple of days, but no clicking or freezing. Too late now I guess.  I'm working on getting this IDE 40 GB drive to work in this machine. I don't know what the problem is, but it freezes on drive detection when the 40 gig is the main drive. It shall be fixed. I hope.  Tomorrow I have a nice long day of cleaning to look forward to. I'll do my regular job from 11 to when I come back from lunch. I'll put a "Closed for July 4th" notice on the door and get most of the junk moved down into the basement and everything else organized. That's going to be  lots  of fun.   The movie is officially in limbo until I get a refurb drive back from Seagate. Since they just send you a refurb drive straight off, I would think that this shouldn't be too long of a wait. I'm crossing my fingers that they have run out of the drive model I have and will need to send me an upgraded drive. Slim chance, but there's always luck.  I'll be back here from work tomorrow afternoon. Ahhh work, I wish they would pay me. I'm off to bed so I can get there on time tomorrow.
