I heard these girl's conversations on the bus ride home, and their 'version' of the english language was so twisted and out of proportion, and their voices were so whiny, I kept thinking to myself... "They can't REALLY be like that, can they? They can't keep that all the time!"  The word Persona came to mind, but it stuck in my head because I didn't know the actual definition of the word. I'm still confused why it popped up.  For when I change my profile, here is what it says:   per·so·na [ p?r s?n? ] (plural per·so·nas, per·so·nae [ p?r s?nee ])    noun     3. psychology personal facade: the image of character and personality that somebody wants to show the outside world.     Sound familiar? We all have one- that really cool walk, the way you talk to certain people... I can think of two examples off the top of my head... one where they are really shy, but then they get on AIM at home and act sad all the time, and are angry at everything, and another where they are the nicest people, but then they get home and put depressing lyrics... it's a charade. They come to school with "The Distillers" shirts on, and it almost seems like they expect to be treated like a loser teenager, and then they get home and act all sad like all this stuff has been brought upon them by anybody but themselves.  I know, rebellion, hipocrisy, etc. etc. Cut the crap. Be yourself.
