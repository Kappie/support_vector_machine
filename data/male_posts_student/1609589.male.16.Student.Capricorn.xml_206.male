Here ya go:  -Having a smoking section in a restaurant is like having a peeing section in a swimming pool.  -Jesus Christ, the Red Hot Chili Peppers aren't THAT good.  -Next person who says "Lawlz" to me, around me, or directed somewhere where I can see/hear it is getting punched in the throat.  -The next skinny girl that says she's fat is getting punched in the throat.  -Referring to hundred dollar bills- it's amazing how a little piece of paper can solve so many problems.  -Cap'n crunch looks like napoleon.  -   -"Send to 15 peeps or more..." -whoops, sorry, i don't have any "peeps." i have friends, but I guess that disqualifies me, eh?  -Horses aren't THAT important and beautiful, are they? Sure, they're cool, but...  -I hate sprites. I hate them i hate them i HATE THEM!!! They look so crappy, do these people think they're some kind of art form? They look like SHIT!!!  It's not as long as the last one, but i wanted to get these out before something bad happens to my text file X-P
