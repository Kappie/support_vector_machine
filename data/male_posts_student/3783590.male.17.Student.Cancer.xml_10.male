I hope you enjoy because it took me a while to sort through the many sites and pick out some of the best ones. As you see, we have established a new domain for our web site, but are not done with the site itself. Hopefully we'll be able to add more stuff to the site in the next few weeks. Yes, I know there are some mistakes and they will be corrected soon (I hope).  Ok, I am off to bed.   Good Night Kids
