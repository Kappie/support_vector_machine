Today was somewhere juxtaposed between these two extremes. I just want someone to tell me how to feel. Im happy because she said shed try. Im sad because I dont think shell be able to go. Im happy because I think she loves someone very much. Im wretched because I know its not me. I cant blame her for her emotions, because they come from a place trapt within the soul, unreachable and unchartable. In the end, you can only smile and nod.
