Ryan was quick to point out quite astutely that these helicopters must be our country's defense against the commies. They're attacking!  Luckily, I feel a little safer knowing that secret undercover FBI Agent Cat Lockner is monitoring the situation from Foothill College. I can sleep in my bed* in peace.  * or mattress   IMPORTANT UPDATE: I realize now that the commies must be being led by their agent in America, Ralph Nader! He must know about Operation: Green Blood! Our lives are doomed! Everyone locate their nearest bomb shelter!
