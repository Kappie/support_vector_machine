If I were to die, suddenly now, would people remember me, and if yes, what as. Would they remember me as "that little ba$+ard who gave me the finger" ot "a cool goy who f****d it up". -Well, partof me today wanted to commit suicide.   Holy s**t! Ive just realised the implications of what I just said. HJeres me, a 12-year-old, sitting here, chewing some plastic, seriously concidering  suicide !  Well, just if I do snuff it today, can you please remember one thing. Please...   For centuries, the world has been, and will continue to be rigged with people both willing and able to exploit the ignorant. Someday, nobody knows when, all the ignorant who have been scammed willl rise up and defeat theese vast bodies. The rebels will suceed and life will be a fair thing. Until...
