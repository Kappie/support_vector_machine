Licence plates are cartoonishly large, and the money is also very large, but seems more antiquated than cartoonish. Still, my overall impression is of having suddenly been transported into the not-too-distant future (I feel like this is a common enough fictional premise, but actually the only example I can think of is that movie Demolition Man). I just bought a ticker to Lancaster and then thought, had aboot, how does one find out the train information? Do they have electronic displays, or just timetables? The enormous flat-screen display just had plane times, so I wandered over to the timetables, but came across an information terminal right by it. The touch sensitive screen allowed me to discover the possible routes, employing public transport, between any two points in the entire country, and give me a timetable. What’s more, it gave me directions of how to get from one place to another on foot. And what’s even more than that, it then gave me a comprehensive free print-out of all the details.
