But takin it out on her is one thing but taken it out on her in public is somin i should have never dun! Someone i care so much about! even if were not friends! and even if she dont care bout me! i cant say i dont wanna be her friend or even more than that like we were once before! i wanna see her and myself grow closer in our walks with God! I want that before ne thing! me and Kayla broke up for this reason! and we arn't friends ne more cause of this reason(like u can see above in the newest entree) and you wouldn't believe how bad i feel for puttin all of what i did have here! I care bout Kayla and her feelings! thats why even when im not her friend i do things she likes , like not wearing all black and cussing i dont wanna go bak the way i was before i met Kayla i used to be depressed and useless really! She changed me God made me and her meet for a reason! to change me and make me closer to him! and it has worked really good! and unfortunately for me we had to brake up cause we were makin each other our 1st priorities! and God needs to be it! and once again im gonna say this Kayla Im so so sorry for hurting ur feelings i never wanted to do that! ever! and i truely am sorry! and ive been bothering u lately jus to help! not to hate! alright allz i guess im dun here i jus hope she forgives me cause i would never wanna hurt her! ill ttyl allz after school! ALLOW GOD INTO UR HEARTS!!! i love ya'll and so does God! l8erz Brent
