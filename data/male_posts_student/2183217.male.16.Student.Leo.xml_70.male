Then the teacher tells everyone to get in line, at this point where we were standing, two people face one way, and i start walking away. then i realize i was going the wrong way and go stand with them. The teacher comes and goes NO OVER THERE!! so we bunch up in the direction i was heading...this seems to be happening all over the class so it's not only us who were utterly confused.  SINGLE FILE !!! he yells.. he means in a horizontal line but of corse we all line up vertically. NOT PILED UP ON EACHOTHER U DICKHEAD, just , side by side. yeah . He gets heffed and places us where we were supposed to go . Then hes like GET WIDE!GET WIDE! by this time im in that crouching SHUT UP I CANT TAKE IT HAHAHA position and i yell WHAT DO YOU MEANNNNN WIDE!and i dont get a response, well maybe i did but god knows i was laughing too hard to hear it. He rushes in front of the class in fear of losing the lines he just made because everyone has the attention span of about. wait... what was i talking about ? ... lol.. no .. ok... then yah , he starts jogging around trying to explain what a hook play and a slant and everything is to a bunch of 16 year olds with the brain capacity of 2 year olds before he loses our attention again and has to start all over. The look on his oh so flustered face just got me and i burst out laughing for the whole time he explained. I think i was crying and holding onto kaylas shoulder while slapping my knee. It wasn't like someone said a joke, i was simply laughing at his face. He knew too because that made him even redder and that made me laugh even harder.  Then the drill started. Two passes were thrown before everyone was like WHERE DO I GO?? HERE? WHATS A SLANT! CAN I GO TO THE BATHROOM? WHATS A QUARTERBACK!etc etc. by this time the teacher is almost in tears and i think he is almost suicidal and i think i just blew a pissed my pants 15 times in a row. Also , i don't have Scurvy anymore. This just in , Snake speaks chinese.
