Orlando Bloom- Ok, I put this not-so-good little thing about him in my profile, but on the off chance that you all never read it, here it is:  Okay. About Orlando Bloom. You ALL know that I hate him. VERY VERY MUCH! If you don't know that, please, go crawl back under your rock for another nine months. Now, for those of you who have not returned to the rocks, you know that I hate him. Now, I think that I have finally gotten over myself and am able to be around things pertaining to him with acceptable self-control. However, there is still a certain amount of pressure that is caused by him to me simply because my hatred of him is so strong, he is EVERYWHERE, and my hatred is constantly nagging at the back of my mind. There are times when this boulder of pressure becomes heavier and harder to hold, and sometimes I feel as if my neck is breaking. Should I just give up? Or, try to live up to this expectation that I should be able to accept you girls' "love" of him without any thought or effort. It takes effort just to keep a cool head around things pertaining to him. But sometimes the pressure becomes too great, and I'll slip, and I may lash out at you, and then you will call me pathetic because I am "jealous". How do I know this? Simply because it has all happened before. Now, I love Hillary more than life in itself, but then there are some of you who are determined to use this Orlando Bloom issue to make my life a living Hell. Those of you who are out to make my life a living Hell are the people I will lose my patience with most often. And, even though you are the people who take no consideration of my feelings, I still apologize to you for losing my patience. I don't have a lot of it, and I fear that at this point, what I do have is finally run out. There are those of you who DO make the effort NOT to mention him around me, or to go onto the subject of him, two of you in particular being Hillary and Laura. I thank all of you people (not just the two mentioned) for doing this for me. It's probably the only thing that keeps me sane when I have to think of him. To the rest of you who do not try, I am sorry I lash out. I am sorry to every girl I have ever hurt because of this. It is not my place to decide whether or not you can like some guy you have no hopes in getting. I hope that all you girls will accept this apology and will forgive me for all the pain I have caused you. That is all I have to say on the matter.   Gilderoy   **PS** To Nikky and Danielle, who say the "US" group is sad (you're not the only ones but you are the worst): You say the "US" group is "sad". Well, in turn, I say your obsession is "sad". But, if I can manage to get over myself on this issue, I believe you can do me the service of getting over yourselves on the issue of the "US" group. Once again, you are not the only two, but you are the worst of the people who oppose the "us" group. You are still my friends, and I hope and pray that you don't take this personally, but I just had to get it out of me. I apologize if you do take it personally.  ----That was fun, wasn't it? Of course not, but that is the last thing I will ever say on this issue, ever again. So, you've all just read my last stand on my side of the argument. Congratulations.   Cell Phones- Yeah. You all know that I am in ownership of a cell phone. But, there are certain people who confuse "spoiled" with "responsible and mature." For the record, I pay for my cell phone. It is not a monthly bill, but a pay-as-you-go method. The first ten minutes of each day is $0.25. After that, each minute is $0.10. Sounds expensive, huh? Not unless you are one of those people who either: A) Like to spend every second of your free time playing with the VE's, which cost additional or B) You are the type of person who likes to talk on your cell phone like it is your home phone. Now, I am "responsible" and "mature", not spoiled. I work and toil to make the money that pays for the cards that put time on my phone. And it is NOT easy labor. Then there are the types of people whose, though they are on the same plan as me, parents buy them the cards, they do not work for the money nor do they pay for the phone. This type of a person is spoiled. See the difference? I hope so. If you don't, too bad. I am not spoiled, at least not on the cell phone matter.   At this point, I'm extremely tired. However, I am too worried to sleep. I don't understand why I am worried exactly but I have this weird feeling of worry nagging at the back of my mind. I think I'll continue to talk all about all the things I have opinions on at the moment.   Dating at our age- Well, now, I never thought that I would be one who would give his opinion on this simply because I didn't know what I thought up until about the middle of seventh grade. A long time ago, I know. But, still. I had an opinion then, but it didn't seem to be as big an issue until the issue about the "US" group (which I will discuss next.) I seem to remember that when the debate began, Danielle pointed out to me that she, though not directly stating it, did not believe that we should have "couples" at our age. I have to present my opinion now, because I want everyone to know what I think, whether they like it or not. Personally, as you may have guessed from what I have written above, I am in favor of dating at our age ONLY IF the people doing the "dating" are under certain conditions. Now, you can all guess these, but I am stating them still for those of you who are stupid and can't figure them out yourself. The first one, naturally, is they have to be mature enough. How mature is mature for this, you may ask. Well, I can tell you, it really depends upon the person, but the one thing that I will state is that you are not mature enough if you use this just to gain social recognition or popularity, as so many do. The second, and final, condition is that the people have to actually LIKE each other enough to be able to be together. I would like to close by saying that dating is not a game, and if it is taken seriously, as it should be, it is perfectly acceptable at our age IF the conditions stated above are present.   The "US" Group- Haha! Oh yes, this is gonna be hilarious. Ok, for those of you who live in holes and do not have access to current information, there is a group of four people, myself included. The other three are: Hillary, Mike, and Laura. There has been a certain complaint about this, that we shouldn't do things every weekend and not include everyone. On that point, I would like to state that maybe we don't want to go with large groups all the time, especially myself and possibly including Hillary, because I(we) tend to feel uncomfortable because I(we) feel as if people are always watching us. And, as if this uncomfort isn't enough to make me feel guilty, people bug us to death that we don't interact with each other. People, mind your own business, ok? If we are going to interact, we will do it on OUR watches, not yours. Next, Nikky complained to me that Mike and Laura aren't even going out. So what? They are friends, and they double dated with me and Hillary because the rest of you "don't believe in dating at our age." Since then, it's just become a tradition. Plus, Mike is my best friend, and Laura is one of Hillary's best friends. Therefore, it is logical that we would pick them to come along. And Mike and Laura are still friends, so what difference does it make? Next, do you all feel left out? I figured, and you know what? You act as if we never do anything with you. But I would like to point out that you all prefer to do things on an occasional basis, whereas we enjoy getting out of the house and doing things every weekend. If you want to do things every weekend, I am sure that we would all LOVE to include u, but if you act like you have about this, well, I am just not as sure anymore.   Alright, I am done, so you may now go enjoy yourselves somewhere else. BYE!   |->~JACK SPARROW~
