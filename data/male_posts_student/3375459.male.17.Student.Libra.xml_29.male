Scary~ I had a tummy ache, rush into the toilet before and after gundam seed. And another time much much later. I'm wondering was it something I ate.   Anyone who has the Japanese anime "Fruit Basket" VCD please leave a comment, thankx =) it felt like a Sunday today, with nothing to do during the afternoon. so I took a nap, and dreamt. I dreamt of myself buying a drink from a vending machine, whereby every drink cost $1.05. All I held was a one dollar coin and a fifty cent coin, so I slot it in and got my drink. WAHahahhahahahaaa......... I hit jackpot when the machine return me my change. Lots of gold coins came out, nice shimmering gold coins. The weird thing was they were all not from Singapore. The coins come in all shape and sizes, and I woke up while going through the different types of coins. Sure enough it was a short 45mins nap.  Later this evening, Lao Er kind of left the computer on and chat away on the phone. So I took over, but she orders me not to logout of her msn messenger. And Then I saw SLEEPING BEAUTY! Too bad I couldn’t get her photo... HEhehee.. Oh well =) Lao Da asked me to decide on a new printer, so we surf the net. She asked for ink that won't smudge, and I was thinking about separated colour cartridges. So we came across the Epson C63, its $50 cheaper then the C60 we bought back then. DAmn, but still I wonder about the ink cartridge price. Hope it’s cheap and last longer too.   Then I came across an ad selling figurines in somebody's blog, so cute. An ad in a blog, now why didn't I think of that? Though the price wasn't really a steal, but I got them. I don't have the physical thing with me now, but the deal has ended. I've better smash my piggy bank and start counting *evil grin* MUAHahahhahahaaaa..........
