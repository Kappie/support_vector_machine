Yes, yes, I know, Wes is white, but Wes also is somewhat multi-cultural.  So bear with me.  Any occasion that has fireworks is the shit.  Especially the Year of the Monkey.    My dad told me what he would do as a child in Singapore on Chinese New Year.  He would walk around to all the rich people's houses and get "lai see" (little red envelopes with 1 dollar bills) as lucky gifts.  The streets would be red with paper, so much paper, and fireworks abound.  Amazing.  I would love to see that sometime, or just visit Asia in general.  I go to Europe so much it loses its...... excitement.  Its beautiful, still, but very hum-drum.  I think I should go visit Berlin or Amsterdam (again) when I'm older.  Annyway, this morning I somehow found the energy to get out of bed, clean my room, do a wash, clean my coat, anf finish reading Miyamoto Musashi's Book of Five Rings.  Amazing, how did I do all that?  I am feeling a bit better, which is good to know.  Life can only be understood but must be moved forwards, I guess.  Speaking of the Five Rings, I would suggest to all of you to read it.  It's not just for martialists, but anyone who seeks Zen through their craft.  Its great advice for anyone in competition with anything, and Musashi simply states truths brilliantly.  I liked it.  There is no such thing as Yin-Yang.  That is not to say, Yin-Yang does not exist.  It took me some time to realize what that meant, but it suddenly hit me in understanding, such suttle words.  Wisdom.  Read the book though, its enlightening.  It makes me want to pick sword fights with people.   http://www.fanta.dk/showmovie.asp?mid=40841BBE-6DE8-4327-A31A-8EBBD8955B0B  Go there, I made it.   I'm driving later today, and then I'm gonna right my little English summaries, since I have little else to do.  Maybe sign up for the ACT.  Maybe write my English script.
