He really grilled him on whether or not he really knew Tina and what their relationship is at the moment and what he finds attractive in her and if he is not just falling in love with a dream or ideal person.  Tyke really learned from this experience and it made him rethink his place.  He thus began to see Tina in a different light, although not a bad one it is different from what he past perceived.  He does understand the fact that there might not even be a point in "chasing" her.  And he is actually considering whether or not to continue on the path he is on now which could just lead to further heartbreak and despair or whether to take the next turn in life.  This is not a decision that can be made overnight and it may take quite some time to actually decide.  But the point is that, despite his feelings for Tina, he might be giving up his seemingly pointless pursuit of a girl that is just out of his league.  He is a hopeless romantic and in this situation the key word is HOPELESS.  So ladies, if you are looking for a guy who will devote himself to you, talk to Tyke.  Well that sounds bad, sounds a little obsessive/desperate.  That is not the intended message.  Tyke is available.  There, that sums it up.
