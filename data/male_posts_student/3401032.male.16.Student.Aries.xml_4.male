Which is probably no one but me. So, I am going to pick up where I left off. Ok, I am at the summer school camp thing i mentioned earlier. The first week was kind of intersting. Two kids, one of whom was my friend. His name was Chaz. Anyway, Two kids at the camp got kicked out for posession of illegal drugs. It was a shock. I am still keeping in touch with Chaz, and he said that the other guy, who was a senior, pressured him into it. But, Chaz is still cool and he is really kicking himself for doing that. Other than that, nothing much has happened. Two girls got in a fight over me. THAT was cool. Also, i dyed my hair. It is brown now. So, one of my advisors needs to use the computer, becuase hers is not working and it is pissing her off so until the next post, stay cool. [LIKE ME ]Later!
