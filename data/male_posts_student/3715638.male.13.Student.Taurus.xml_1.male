That because its my first year in the age group. Oh well, lining up was fun. I was talking with everyone, Scott, Ally, Erica, Annie, Kevin, and this kid from Hopkinton or Holliston? I don't remember, but, hes on the team and yea. Well, I changed the name of this blog. I don't know why but, I think the other name was just stupid, but the URL (thats the address) is the same(frenchisbad.blogspot.com). Two foot Prymaid, I know its really weird, but I couldn't think of anything and I was looking at the prymaid that I drew on the back of my social studies notebook. It took me a while, but its really cool, I drew every little block into it, maybe someday you might see it. I named it the Prymaid of Phin. But its cool, it takes up most of the page. Wow, I'm really random right now. Eliza told me a line from her play. Its like "One time I ran over a squirel and kept driving!" I guess shes one of the siners in the play, Anything Goes. Well, I'm going to go see it when they are putting it on.
