We never really get any rain out in CA and when we do, it's crappy rain. It's not any fun to stand in and tastes funny. Anyway, I wrote Ali and asked him if he wanted to go out and eat something or drink something or get a Jamba Juice or just hang out or whatever and he said sure. But then I realized I needed to take a shower and get ready because well, why would one take a shower and get ready if all they're gonna do is sit and home, eat, play guitar, program a bit, chat, and read all day? Anyway, I needed to take a shower and make myself presentable to the world so after much avoiding the shower, I finally got in and started the whole process of shampoo, body wash and bla bla bla. But then it hit me while I was wetting my hair before I put the shampoo in, "Too much time gets wasted in the shower. Most people take 10 toe 15 minute showers. I think that if I could shorten this time by even the littlest bit, we could make the US a more productive place." And so in an effort to save time in the shower, I tried to do multiple things at once. I took the shampoo and put it in my hair and massaged into the scalp and all that good stuff and then I got the body wash and tried to apply it at the same time as I rinsed the shampoo out of my hair. It turns out that this is 1) really hard, 2) it doesn't really save much time, and 3) hurts a lot. I ended up not being able to see where I was putting the body wash and accidentally opened my eyes while I was rinsing the shampoo out so all the shampoo got in my eyes and, being the quick-thinking individual I am, tried to rub the shampoo out with my hands, which happened to be at the time, still covered in body wash. So, in conclusion, not only did I not save a lot of time, but I made a lot of noise, and irritated my eyes to the point of staying red for 30 minutes after. I do not recommend using this technique.  Anyway, I got out of the shower and got dressed, but then remembered that I had to empty out the entertainment center for Andrew and Anandita (sp?) so that they could use it after we left. But I had to do this all before I left to see Ali because I needed it done before my dad got back which, while I knew would be late, I knew that I would not be home long before he was (we actually came home together after I met with Ali). Ok, so there I am being all quick'a'like takin' all the CD's outta the drawers when I realize "damn, most of these CDs are mine... and I've got over 300 of 'em. That's kind of a lot, when you think about it considering that I bought most of them at 15 to 20 bucks, which means that I've spent over... 4500 bucks on music. The RIAA must love me... but then again, they must hate me too because I'm a pirate. YARR!"  It's kind of interesting to me that the RIAA got all bent out of shape over pirates and then started going after small-time people like me. I mean, really, who are they to come to me for stealing one crappy pop song after I've bought probably over 5000 dollars of music. I mean, god, some things just really bug me about America, but when I think about it, I think "at least I'm not worrying that someone will bomb me because at least the US government, while not fixing a lot of stuff at home, has been busy spending my parents tax dollars to kick everyone else's ass. I am damn lucky to be an American, not necessarily proud, but damn lucky." I believe in the old, classic American values, but I'll be damned if someone called me proud to be an American if it's associated with killing small children with million dollar missiles and calling it the american dream, the american way, or the true expression of american values. I love my country, but damn, it's gotta clean up it's act a bit. Maybe if we stop fucking with people, they'll stop trying to fuck with us. I dunno, that's just my theory.  Moving on, I went to MIT and met up with Ali and we were going to go to Jamba Juice, so we walked over to Boston, which is about a 20 to 30 minute walk, but the queerbees over there decided that they were gonna renovate or something so it was closed. Since we were in Boston, we decided that it would be a good idea to get something to eat so we went to the Prudential Center (a mall) and were uninspired by the selection, except for a Krispy Kreme, to which we both went and got donuts. I really don't think Krispy Kreme is really all that good especially for the price. I mean, the actual donut itself in terms of the dough is debatably better, but they've got nothing on the cream or chocolate of Dunkin' Donuts, and since my favorite donuts are the ones with either chocolate frosting, cream filling, or both, I really would much rather go to Dunkin' Donuts. Also, not only is Krispy Kreme's not as tasty as Dunkin' Donuts, but it costs more; A single donut at Dunkin' Donuts is like 65 cents, if I'm not mistaken, while a single donut at Krispy Kreme's is 90 cents. I dunno, the whole thing just bothers me because I think Dunkin' Donuts is better than Krispy Kreme's, but everyone else that I talk to says Krispy Kreme's is much better. And I guess eventually, if everyone feels the same way that the people I've talked to feel, Dunkin' Donuts will be forced to go outta business and I won't have anywhere to go for great coffee and breakfast sandwiches in the middle of the day. Sigh. I guess that's one of the problems with open markets, capitalism, and democracy.  Getting back to what I was doing today, after blowing three bucks on donuts and being disappointed, Ali and I went over to this greek place on Newbury St., which is a cute street with a bunch of shops and places to eat on it. It's a tourist attraction and it feels a lot like Europe... minus the funny accent the words you don't understand. Anyway, we went to this greek place called Steve's. It wasn't bad, and in fact was kinda good, but a bit hefty in terms of the price. After that, we went to Trader Joe's which was about a block away, if that and looked around for a bit. We didn't buy anything though. Then Ali and I went back to his dorm and hung out and talked about the OS he's writing, TV shows, computer games, and some other chit-chattery type'a'things. After that my day was pretty much over because I ran over to the Media Lab, met up with my dad, caught the train, caught the bus home, talked to people online, and wrote this post.  My life is good. I am privileged and I am acknowledging it here. Thank you, supreme being and all others who've allowed me to live, be, feel, and all that good stuff this way.  That is all. -- Feanor
