The FLight over with Air Transat was pretty rubbish but at least I had a nice girl called Brittni and her Mum Leona to chat to! Thank god as I was sooooooooooooooooooooooooo bored!  I played golf on my first day, Sunday, which I was crap at lol!!! The on monday I visited the Ski Resort of Whistler which was sooooooooooooo pretty! The views at the top of whistler mountain were so beautiful! I have some good pictures!  The shops in Canada are sooooo cool! I love all of the huge shops here - like  Golf Town  where you can get all of the golfing attire you need. Also I think  Radio Shack  is quite cool too and I bought one of their mini remote control ZipZap cars! Its pretty cool!! I also bought my Canadian Sim Card for my Mobile(Cell - man I've gotta talk Canadian!) Phone.  As Mc Donalds would say - BC I'm Lovin It  BTW The Time of this post is PT not GMT
