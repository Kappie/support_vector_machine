Then on Saturday night the guys came over for Halo and Madden.  The recycling can is so full.  Wow, like 50 bottles of pop in there.  Soooo many.  Haha, but what house is the party house?  Tyke's house!!!  This was a good night for Tyke just chilling with the guys.  Well and the Trew-fanator came over as well with Tyronius but still just a night with the guys.  And on a side note, to update the search for a girl for Tyke...well the search is trudging along.  No accomplishments have been made yet and really everyday has been exactly the same as the last but still, only time will tell.  Tyke will leave you with a poem.  Roses are red, violets are blue, hey guess what? I want to hump you.  (wow that is sooooo bad--in more than one way)
