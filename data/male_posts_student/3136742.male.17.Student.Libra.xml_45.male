My face is all itchy.  urlLink  I don't believe in God  (grew up wanting to be a Roman-Catholic Priest til I was about 13, ironically enough), but last night, again in a half-sleep state, I started thinking that I should pray more. It used to be such a big part of my life. It was therapeutic; talking to yourself, you don't cover much, but talking like there's someone else there, you learn more about yourself. Not having faith, you don't go about your life thinking that your actions dictate your fate, so you end up enjoying life less, thinking way too much, and really doing a lot less. I need a counterweight to that, as crazy as it sounds. I've lost the ability to NOT be an analytical prick. I need to go out and enjoy myself.  I need to start meeting new people. I'm tired of doing the same old shit. None of my friends like to "hang out" like most people. You know, just get together to watch TV and talk-- have a laugh. They want to make plans of what they're gonna do, so they can end up not doing them and playing old nintendo games instead or going through a yearbook and asking me what I hate about each person... I don't care who it is anymore either. There was this girl that tried to get friendly with me. Sure she was cute, fun and all (hell, she probably would've fucked me too), but that didn't matter. She was dumb as a fucking brick (and her father was a nuclear engineer. How's that work?) and she did too many drugs. I didn't need that shit... Now I don't care. I'll settle for anyone new and fun-- unpredictable.   and I need to stop posting so early in the morning.  Me and Kris were talking about how great the old Nickelodeon was. Remember all those great shows?:  - Hey Dude - Wienerville - Are You Afraid of the Dark? - Guts - Pete and Pete - Wild and Crazy Kids - Rocko's Modern Life - Stick Stickly's summer show - Ledgends of the Hidden Temple, with Kirk Foooooggggggggggg - Double Dare - What Would You Do? - Ren and Stimpy - Roundhouse (so horrible) - All That (I can't believe I made my parents sit through that shit) - Snick (and Snick on Halloween was the shit! I used to skip trick-or-treating just to watch it) - Ah! Real Monsters - That show where they used to put the kids in the video games am I missing anything?
