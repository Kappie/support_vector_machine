And people wonder why we have such a bad attitude towards the UN.  With all the problems in the world, including famine, oppression, genocide, and AIDS, the United Nations has chosen to combat something that harms no one, more or less.  Granted, a lot of SPAM is sheer, ruthless thievery.  But a good majority of it is nothing more than an annoyance.  The only people that are taken advantage of and fall prey to thieves and scams are morons who have ignored every warning against responding to malicious emails.  SPAM is annoying, but it hardly merits a full scale UN investigation by one of its agencies.  The goal is to lobby world governments to pass standardized legislation that will allow law enforcement agencies to crack down on spammers.  Great.  Good times.  But why is the UN doing this?  Why has the International Telecommunications Union, a UN agency, decided this is a pressing issue?  Why is there such an agency to begin with?  There are more pressing problems in the world that need much more attention than they are being given, according to the UN.  AIDS is but one example, and is oft cited by the UN as the most pressing world problem, but there are plenty of others.  Money quote:   "Spam and anti-spam protection cost computer users some $25 billion last year, according to the United Nations."   Just great.  Instead of costing computer users $25 billion, most of which can be reclaimed by them if the proper channels are used, it will cost the UN $25 billion.  This is money that could be better spent to help relieve the AIDS crisis in Africa.  But alas, it appears as though the UN crying about lack of funds to combat such catastrophic problems is nothing but words.  Unlike many of my Republican friends, I do not see the UN as a worthless organization that is defunct and should fade away just as the League of Nations once did.  Nor do I agree with my Democrat friends who believe the UN should be consulted at all costs and consulted with and revered.  The UN is a very important body that can do a lot of good around the world.  Indeed, it has done a lot of good and continues to do so.  But the UN is also a massive bureaucracy.  It is filled with some of the most corrupt individuals in the world.  This is something that all governments face, but some actually combat it.  The UN probably does as well, but it also puts on a good show of combating the problem.  Many individuals in the UN are friends and have worked together for many years, so its only logical that they would stick up for each other.  Under these circumstances such corruption should be expected.  The most damaging case of corruption the UN has faced is the still unfolding Oil for Food scandal.  It turns out that the Oil for Food program was filled to the brim with corruption of every kind.  Saddam bribed UN officials involved in running the program, and Saddam himself was allowed to run the program without UN oversight.  Its no wonder so many Iraqis starved and died during the twelve years of sanctions.  Saddam circumvented sanctions through the program, allowing him to stockpile cash he would use to increase his own wealth and opulence, as well as buy food and medicine that went directly to the government and the Republican Guard instead of to those who needed it.  Color me surprised.  But who was blamed during those twelve years?  The United States, despite trying to close the loopholes and end the corruption.  But other nations, such as France and Germany, actively worked against our efforts.  Now they are viewed as the most righteous nations because they opposed the Iraq War.  There's a reason why they didn't want the war: they were afraid that it would reveal the truth about their dealings with Iraq.  Its becoming apparent that France and other nations may have had something to do with the Oil for Food scandal.  It is the UN, however, that must take the blame.  They should be combating such manipulation of their organization.  Hopefully this scandal will result in a massive push for meaningful reform within the body.  Reform is something that is much needed.  The bureaucracy needs to be thinning, money needs to be directed towards those areas that need it.  The body's activities need to be properly focused.  The body also needs to reflect the democratic nature it was formed to promote and support.  It needs to reflect the focus on human rights it was designed to further.  No more Sudans or Libyas in control of the human rights committees.  The UN needs to support those nations that are democratic, reward those nations that have taken steps towards democratization, and pressure those that show blatant contempt for democracy and human rights.  But until that happens, expect the UN to act against such global problems as SPAM while crying about the lack of help for other problems.  Its like a bad Austin Powers script with Dr. Evil threatening to take over the world using SPAM.  That is, unless, of course, they pay him a hefty ransom.
