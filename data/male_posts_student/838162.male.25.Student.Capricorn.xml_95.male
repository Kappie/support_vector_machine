Time is not kind to any of us and if we are not careful, it can overwhelm us, overtake us and leave us alone and bewildered.  Take a good look in the mirror of your heart and soul and realize that you should not take yourself for granted. If there is something you see there that you don't like, take steps to change it. If you don't see anything wrong, then challenge yourself, upgrade or start something new. Take a chance.  Take a good look at the people around you, putting off that outing? Haven't spoken to in months? Pick up the phone, buy that lunch. Especially for the people overseas of which I'm sure we know many. The long months can be brutal.  Take a good look at one's family, there are there for a reason. We are to learn alot from them, one way or another and don't just remained focused on the ones near you. Be thankful for extended families. Do not be content on seeing them just once or twice a year.  And lastly, remember those that are no longer with us. Smile in the memories that we have, but use them to move forward to the future. Take what we have learnt from them and put them into use. The best way to honor their memory.
