Companys here, my grandparents and my cousins and my uncle. wow its 10 already.  I think i'm like 1197 now! 3 freakin away from double hammer!  oh well.  Nobody was on today to play, and besides i didn't play much i had to work more on my eagle speech, which is done now (thankfully) but i still have to present it :(  Confirmation tomorrow too, what great fun... Anyways my verse is anyway, its almost poetic:  "The God we worship can save us from you and your flaming furnace." Daniel 3:17  Hmm thats all for now, later
