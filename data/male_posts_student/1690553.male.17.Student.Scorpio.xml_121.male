Alhamdulillah I'm accepted for Ministry of Education Science Matriculation Programme. I didn't know where I'll be placed until 15th April 2004. Congrats also to  urlLink Habibah ,  urlLink Azra ,  urlLink Sallehuddin ,  urlLink Azleen,  Safiyah  - just to name a few blogging friends. 60+ out of 190+ of my school SPM candidate managed to get a place. Congratulation to all my friends and thanks to all of our teachers, parents, family members, and other individuals who supported us along the way. Special thanks to  urlLink Yayasan Pahang  who organized intensive tuition class for us.  - Sound of  Exodus  by  Maksim  -
