But as you feel lost and alone, But as you just break down and cry, Remember nothing can be done by an idle stone, Remember nothing can be done unless you try.  Lay down your sweet and weary head, Rest upon my shoulder, Let nothing be said, Drift off quietly into silent slumbler.  Take a soft glance around, What do you see? Shelter from violence and sound, Safe with Me.  Safe with Me.  Author: Janet the Kind  Note: Dedicated to someone, you know who you are. Just want this poem to cheer you guys up.
