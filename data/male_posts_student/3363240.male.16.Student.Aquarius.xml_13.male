We had a standardized test though...I really hate those. French was dull. As usual. After that was lunch. Thanks to dan and kaya for supporting the "elan needs sustinance foundation" After I got my food, I went to english to rehearse...but Leah didn't show up...so yeah. I returned to Kaya...and let slip that she said something mean a couple of times....I hope it doesn't bother her. It really has not affected my feelings for her, just kinda brought me off of the could for a sec, so its not even a problem. After lunch was History. We had to take the stupid standardized survey....but we watched George Carlin during the whole thing. So fucking hilarious. That man is so funny. Felix's class is awesome. After History was english. We started Caitie's play and its good shit. Class ended before we could finish...so we'll have to continue tomorrow. I also have to go to english AGAIN at lunch tomorrow to start preparing for Sanyu's play. Annoying. I miss mah Kayah. Much love to everyone. ~Elan
