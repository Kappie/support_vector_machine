Firstly, I'd like to say well done to the GB team in the Olympics today because they have finally started to win some medals (think we got 4 today and if an appeal goes through we will have 5!) after a poor start including Henman's first round exit to Novak. Secondly, lets wonder what is going to happen 2"MOZ" (ie.results day). I'm not expecting a disaster (touch wood) so I'm planning on going out and celebrating afterwards until I can only just remember what my results were.....hopefully, hopefully, hopefully Thirdly (sorry, this should have been the firstly but I forgot), a congrats to This Charming Man on his anniversary day, I'm just waiting for the musical treat he was thinking about making!  I should be writing more than this with 4 days stuff to use but I can't think of anything, I'm too engrossed by the genius of Mark Silverman so I'll leave you with some uplifting lyrics: of course maybe it's because you're as ugly as they come maybe cuz you're fat or maybe cuz you're dumb or maybe it's because you smell the way you do that jesus loves everyone except for you
