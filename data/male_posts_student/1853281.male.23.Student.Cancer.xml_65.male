We read left wing materiel while sipping coffee in bed, met another couple at Pandora's, and than grocery shopped together. It was very nice. Spent sat.night with my mother, we had a great talk and watched Too Wong Foo. Than sunday punk rock brunch and an evening at the chatterbox., followed by watching a bbc movie with r. have just read the nasitiest  urlLink article   ever about beef. I doubt i  will be eating commercially produced beef ever again.  Here is one about the U.S. army destroying  urlLink farms  in Iraq. How frigging stupid is it to detroy farms in a country where people are starving and we are trying to "rebuild" following our destructon of it. I mean Please, get a clue. Ah well. I don't run the world(god forbid) But seriosly, common sense people...Grrrrrr... cheers
