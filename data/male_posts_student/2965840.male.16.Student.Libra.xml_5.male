People are getting annoying at the end of the year and i just want to scream.  I cant stand it, i just want to lay down and go to freakin sleep or spend more than a half an hour watching T.V.  This summer is going to be a well deserved break for me and to be honest i really dont want to put up with people and their stupid problems.  I know that sounds mean, but i dont have the time nor the patience to put up with crap from people right now.      I talked to most of my teachers today to see what i have in their classes and for the most part its good.  Spanish-97,English-96, art-100, european-84 (i know its bad), math-91.7, and stupid science-88.  I really hate science, the stupid teacher wont let me make up a disection that i missed, he said i can do a makeup, but whenever i talk to him about it, he just says, "see me tomorrow". What a douche.        OK so i watched the Angel series finale and man, it sucked.  It didnt feel like an ending show, they didnt finish like anything.  Not to mention that they never gave finality to the Buffy/Angel love story.  Even a simple phrase like "Its time to check the oven," or something like that would have made me (and kat) way more happier.  [For my exact quote check kats blog] Another thing is that Angel killed Hamilton and he is supposed to be immortal while working for Wolfram  Hart but angel sucks his blood then kills him.  Whaaaaa Happened??? Whaaaaa???...........???????  Whaaaaa??? The whole Fred/Wesley thing was sad and i am glad that they atleast finished that thing.  The scene with Lorne and his final act was kinda depressing because it was completely unexpected and the way Lorne handled it was just like his character would.  OK so the whole season and the series for that matter was to get angel back to being a human through the prophecy and they didnt even finish that, those bastards.  We all know that Angel is the true champion and Spike is not, but i still would have liked to see that played out.  ok so me and kat are like, "lets write our own ending for angel on our blogs!"  but do to time constraints until summer, i can only give a brief detail about my ending.  Enjoy!  Angels like, lets separate and kill them all, and everybody is like ok and then they separate (no signing of anysort) and kill all the members of the black thorne or something.  Wesley dies and Iliara mornes and also has more fight scenes, KAAPOW!! Gun is hurt and spike returns the baby.  Lorne leaves and Angel, spike, iliara, and gun meet in the alley.  At around this time, it should be half into the show.  Suddenly!!!!!!!!  Buffy and Gang show up with a buncha slayers, the ones from buffy and more, new ones, and they are all like, lets fight the dragon together! yay!  So they all enter this big fight scene, people die, and bad guys die more.  The camera shows what the characters can do and pans in, to the slayers and others in a cinimatic "oooo my" kinda way.  They kill the dragon, close the portal, and all are safe again.  Upon killing the dragon, angel glows in a mystical light and is all ooooooo ahhhhhhhh.   Buffy turns to him in the last few seconds of the show and is like, im done baking.....   WOW i think that would have better and im sure a lot of you would agree with me.  I know i didnt cover like everything, but remember, this is only a little piece and your gonna have to wait until summa to see the full ending!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    This was one long update and i hope it satisfies all of u people!!! I almost forgot that MY european group holocaust project won for the best in the class, lets see how it holds up for all the classes.
