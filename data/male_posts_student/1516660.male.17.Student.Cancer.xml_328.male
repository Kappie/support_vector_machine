I woke up at 8.30, bathed and meowed online. Mother went to buy breakfast. Oh yes, I called WQ up. If I never called him up, I would be stuck there for hours! Hmm. I ate chee cheong fun, and then meowed online. At 10+, I went off to prepare to go out.  Yeah. I reached Woodlands Interchange, followed by WQ. We are going to this IT Fair at Suntec City. We ate lunch at LJS first. Even ducks meowed at LJS! Okay okay. After meowing and mooing at Combo 1, we took the train to City Hall. HaHa. This time, we didn't listen to the Discman. We talked and talked. I forgot what we talked about, but we meowed. :P  Okay. We alighted at City Hall and walked the long long walkway towards Suntec. Hmm. We have to ride up lotsa escalators to go up there. There were a lot of cats trying to give us pampleths and brochures. Ayioh...meowingly meow meow!  That IT Fair was kinda crowded, but walkable. Hmm. WQ's friend is working there, s we are paying him a visit later. WQ's coming there to look at new PC models. Hmmm. We walked round and round, WQ grabbed pamphlets off counters. HaHa. Hmm. When we were about to leave, we were watching cats play Need For Speed Underground (winner wins something big). HaHa. All the players are so lousy. Even we can win them! As XC would say: "Disgrace to human beings!". HaHa. Actually, WQ can win them better than I do. He's expert at this game man! Even ducks meow!   Okay. We left the thing and went to Carrefour lor. Hmm. I listened to Britney's CD and meowed at it. We walked around...walk walk walk. Then, we decided to go back to the MRT le. My legs were super tired.   On the way to the MRT, we went into MPH. HaHa. We were kinda engrossed into the books. Actually, WQ was reading the magazines while I was reading New Age books. After meowing and mooing at MPH, we went home lor. HaHa. Hmmm. On the way home, I learned lotsa things. If you count them reliable, that is. Heh. Even ducks meowed. I wanted to visit Wendy, but she's stock-taking, so cannot go disturb her. For the last time, Koo Wen Qiang, I don't like Wendy. Neither CQ, Amanda or Joyce. So there.   I came home, bathed and meowed online. Professor Snapeluva gave us a word puzzle! It is bascially find words out of "Shrivelfig". HaHa. I found 56 words, which means I can get 5 Galleons. YaY!   We went for dinner at 6+. Ayioh. At my kueh chap, they put those onions thingys!! ERGH!!! They said "Ayiah...make the soup more nice". I made a face. Next time, I should say "I am allegric to onions". See if they dare to put or not. Meow moo meow!!     I came back and meowingly came online. Tomorrow, me and WQ are going to the Creative Warehouse Sale. Hmm. The cats say they are going to the SHE show tomorrow. Frankly speaking, I don't really feel like going. It's up to WQ tomorrow lor, see if he wanna go after the sale. Hmm. Yeah. Up to WQ meowing cat. Yes.   Okay. I gotta get going. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
