What if I am? Well then, I guess I'm too stupid to realize it. It's not like I don't question what I believe every day. Honestly looking at your faith is a daily process. Faith is not something that you just  feel , it's something that you think about, question, and maintain every single day. And if I've come to the wrong conclusions every single day, then I'm just a fool. People seem to think that the day I became a Christian marked the day that I closed my mind to any other possibility. I haven't closed my mind at all: I examine every possible explanation that I come across in relation to the nature of the universe, philosophical issues, etc. They just don't add up like Christ does. I look at everything skeptically, and so far, Christianity is the only thing that has withstood that scrutiny. I think people are fools if they don't doubt their faith at times. You should always ask the tough questions. Of course, if you don't look for answers, you're not doing yourself any good. But I believe that sometimes the best way to grow in your faith is to doubt it. Every time I've doubted something about Christ, I've looked into it and realized that I doubted out of ignorance, not knowledge. I doubted because I didn't understand something as completely as I should have, not because it didn't make sense. I just couldn't make sense of it because I'm an idiot. Which brings up another point: it doesn't matter what I believe. What matters is the truth. This is why it is so incredibly important to constantly question why you believe what you do ... you need to strive to find what the truth is, and find out if your beliefs match it. Of course, we're tiny human minds. The truth is a concept that we can never be completely sure of. But I think that the more you look for it, the more you'll learn about it. We can never fully comprehend God, but we can do our utmost to try. So if I'm wrong, then I'm a fool. If I'm right, then I'm still a fool ... but I'm a fool who realized the only thing worth realizing. Have I come to the wrong conclusion every single day? It's possible... But I doubt it.
