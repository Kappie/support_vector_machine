It was still kinda early and I was feeling to groove because of the good music mix from my Nomad but most importantly because I happened to have my Cybershot with me. Been awhile since I took any new pictures and had forgotten alot of techniques and settings tips. But I think they turned out pretty ok.    urlLink    Of Steel and Glass      urlLink    Loney Walkways      urlLink    The Endless Search      urlLink     At the Plane beyond
