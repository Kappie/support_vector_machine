The tape begins with Berg saying a few things about his family and where he's from and then one of the militants reads a long ass statement which ends with the group forcing a bound Berg to the floor and sawing off his head. I heard Berg's high-pitched screams just barely over the militants' shouts of "Allah!" Then, after they finish sawing his head off, they hold it high to prove it's been cut off. That shit is sooo fucked up; the government needs to save the rest of the Abu Ghraib prison abuse pictures for several years until Iraq is under control and successful. Then, only after the release of the pictures wouldn't be as big a deal, the pictures should be released.  And that's my story and I'm sticking to it.   BTW: You can see the video (which is  very  graphic and not for squemish people) at  urlLink The Memory Hole's website .
