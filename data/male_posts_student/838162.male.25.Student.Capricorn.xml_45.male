Very exciting time it is. We as a Ministry have been praying for a place of our very own for a very long time. Before this we would always be sharing space with other services which would result in some difficulties, such as the sound and worship team only having 15 minutes to set up and soundcheck. Now with our own place, we don't really have to worry so much about such details of where we are and instead can focus more time on what really matters, the people.  However there is still some work that needs to be done. The sound system is not totally complete as of yet. Still missing some cables, floor monitors and effect boxes. Not to mention our own drumset. And the sound team is going to take some time to get used to the acoustics of the new hall. I estimate about a month for us to really settle in. In addition, the sound team now has greater responsibilities, not only for the audio equipment, but now the instruments as well as the whole Hall itself. Frankly I'm looking forward to the challenge.  In any case the very first service there was a blast. There was this new energy and new joy that just spread throughout the people as the musicians played. This is not to say that we only praise Him when we get new stuff, but sometimes it is indeed good to see change in how He provides and cares for us. Of how prayers can be answered, even after many years. The unity of the ministry is growing, not just because we are closer physically while standing in the hall, but because we have been given a greater sense of identity. I can only foresee this unity growing.    >   I had a blast today hanging out with the guys at our favorite LAN shop. It's not been often lately that I get to hang out with them, especially with the “kid”  Jst  Lm  who so happened to drop by today to have lunch with us, or so he claims *grins*. I don't know why I still call him “kid”. Must be because I still remember him as that young, wild spirited , impulsive kid that I tried to take under my wing and mentor him even though the age gap is only around 2 to 3 years. Sorta like Han Solo to Luke Skywalker. Heck, I've had a girlfriend who is as old as him, which, taking the nickname I have for him, would make me a...p...i don't even want to think about it. (and if  Lady Raine  reads this she would kill me, but then again how else can I get her attention these days? *heh* )    >   I know this has been talked to death on the tag-board already. But it's too funny and ironic (to me) to pass up. Just after typing all that I wanted to on the board, I went off to read the latest issue of NewMan (a more local, smarter and less offensive mag than FHM Singapore). Lo and behold what would I find within it's pages but an article about how guys should deal with getting dumped, for a lack of a better word. There...I'm not ashamed to say it anymore. First my best guy friend who sometimes has no right to talk about acting rationally when it comes to relationship trouble. Next the actual ex-GF in question, who is so nice and thoughtful to take the step forward even though she had her reservations about how to deal with me and at the risk of her own emotional state (horrible fake hokkien though *grins*). Normally that should be enough for one to realize that it's time to get up and get moving forward, but no! Someone up there understands how bad I can be when it comes to things like this and sets it up that even a “stupid” Men's mag has to tell me to get off my a$$. All within the space of a few hours! I was laughing the whole way through reading the article.   Yes, it may still hurt, yes i may stumble with the memory from time to time and yes it will take some time. But I have learnt from it, I am better from it, and I know that I had some good times that I will always treasure. The future awaits and I have to keep moving forward to meet it. To continue to live on the edge if you will. “Come what May” it was sung. So be it.
