And when i say that, im saying as in my mothers attitude changing. Apparently it hasnt. The only thing that has changed is that theres no more screaming and verbal abuse anymore. Cept for some of the verbal abuse towards me. I think she needs a therapist badly, but apparently everyone believes that IM the one that needs the therapy. That just goes to show that im the only normal one besides one of my aunts in which has the same exact perspectives as me. I think that got brought down a generation. My aunt Susan is basically an older and female version of me with a slightly bit of... how should i put this... Orthodox meets Un-Orthodox? Like shes normal but she can get weird like for example... We go to the store and stuff, and she thought that this cereal was 2 for $3. Apparently after paying and walking out, she takes notice to the reciept and glances at the price of the cereal noticing that it was charged $3 each rather than 2 for $3. She then started getting agitated saying that it was 2 for $3 and that she was going to go back and stuff to fix this... All this commotion for 3 lousy dollars...?    The new apartment is great. Its spacious. White marble floors as i took a notice towards. Tons of closet space. My room is slightly smaller than my other room in great neck, but now with 2 closets. Its fine for me...    Ive been going through hell lately though. Thinking and hoping that my mother would change, its just the same her all over again. Her uselessness, her mental agony and pallid seriousness. Its really sickens me how she doesnt listen. I feel very ignored and in a loner sense of view.    Im also extremely angry. At the time of the move from Great Neck to Forest Hills, the movers had finally arrived. All morning my father was drunk and high and causing serious trouble. I was so excited to leave that i almost teared. I was that happy. After finally almost packing the entire truck with all the furniture, my dad takes off with the car. My mother thought he would come back due to the fact that my brother is mentally retarded and has diabetes, he'd come back. Apparently her judgement was way off. He never came back. We had to get the movers to drive to the new place. My mother had called my sister to open the door for them during the move while we thought of a way to get there. My mom then came to the conclusion that we should just take a cab since he wasnt coming. She did a smart thing i suppose, especially since when the cab came, it was luckily a gigantic van. Kinda like the one where it has 16 seats for Airport transport.    We couldnt take everything. I had to leave my desk there because it wasnt able to fit through the door. What could i do, the shit was built in my room. And i also did an extremely stupid thing. My clean laundary was left in the dryer. And on top of that, the worst fear i could ever encounter, my computer was left there.    It was very terrifying though, but i knew that we would go back eventually and get it. Apparently we didnt. I was supposedly to go today with a friend to get it. Apparently he never showed up. The landlord of the house had threatened to evict my mom sending a letter of eviction and a date in which we had to move out everything, otherwise lead to legal actions. Also apparently my father had called my mother claiming that the landlord "Sylvia", had disposed of all of our things to the street corner. Either my dad was high and fucking with my mother, or the bitch really did. If she did, shes getting her skull cracked and her ass in court.    Currently its 12:41 AM and im waiting for my sister and cousin to come back from a bar that they go to every Thursday, Friday and Saturday. A weekly pre-weekend to weekend ritual for them. When they get back, ill most likely go to bed since im tired.    Tomorrow im HOPING i can go get my computer. Thats all i really care about. My computers, my monitor and my floppy disk containing all my important fed-free information in which if i lost would result in total depression and disaster. Its irreplacable and im hoping i packed it.    Ill finalize this post by stating that im on my aunts computer and that tomorrow my friend will be coming. Looking foward to that. Also on Friday which is actually today -- it being 12:43 AM -- i will be babysitting my cousins daughter between 11 PM to 3 AM. Thats hours after my friend will be here and gone. Then on saturday im going out with my cousin and sister and possibly another good friend of mine -- Belle -- to a restaurant or something. Cant wait for that =). Ta ta.
