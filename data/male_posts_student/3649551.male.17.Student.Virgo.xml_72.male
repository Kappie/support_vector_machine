It's too seriously written. My mom says I'm lazy because I don't have an actual job. I point out that I  will  have a job when school starts, that I'll be gone most of the month of August, and that even if I did get a job I wouldn't get paid until the end of the month. Yet I am expected to pull money out of my ass, I guess. True, I spend more than I need to and I don't earn what I spend. What can I say? I'm pretty apathetic toward work - I only care about money in terms of food and gas. Those things tend to allow me to interact with the people I enjoy being around. Lazy is a strange term. Is it knowing what you ought to do and not doing it? Crap ... according to James that's a sin. I'm a sinner. But wait: ought I to be working and getting paid? James actually said that he who knows the  good  he ought to do and doesn't do it sins. Now things get subjective. Is it good for me to generate some cash and take the pressure of my mom? But my dad pays child support and my money comes out of that. My mom doesn't even have a job. But that's irrelevant because this is about me working, not her. I think that if I worked I would feel too busy for youth group stuff, as well as Finding the Plot. (Which was spectacularly undermanned last meeting.) I find fellowship and spiritual growth to be a lot more important than work, but I can still see the value in working harder. Oh well. None of it matters, anyway. I'll be working once school starts. This was really just an excuse to ramble on senselessly.
