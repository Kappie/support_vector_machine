It seems Saddam had been cutting lucrative contracts with Russia and France in exchange for opposition to the US led effort.  So does this make the war 'all about oil' for those that accused us of going in to seize the oil?  Does Pelosi think we still should have 'internationalized' the war?  Maybe if we offered these guys contracts on ANWAR drilling, they would have joined us and the Left would feel so much better.  Check out pages 2-4 of the story. That is the actual list of contracts (in millions of barrels of oil) let out to each individual or group.
