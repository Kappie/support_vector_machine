Not quite until my eyes hurt, but almost. Had it not been for the trip back into Red Deer from Blackfalds for some more Timmy Ho's, it would have been a lot of movies. 'Twas a grand old time.  Not a big fan of Dirty Dancing.  Or Footloose (which had been in the plans, but was already rented at the movie store). Damn that Kevin Bacon.  Well. My car is looking somewhat melted, so at least it's blowing warm air. Farewell.
