My mind is a mob let loose when it comes to writing things, so it's hard for me to stay committed to writing in a certain style or with a limited range of content. Anyways, forget the introductions, I'll show you by example.  Right now the blog is called "Tierra Y Libertad" because I like it. It was the motto of Emiliano Zapata (it means Land and Liberty), a leading figure in the Mexican Revolution and an influence to a lot of indigenous civil rights movements in Mexico. For years he campaigned for the rights of the Indians of Morelos gain their land back from the hacendados who had stolen their land attacked their people(one group of hacendados burned down an entire village). However, the government hesitated to help the indigenous cause and the people could no longer stand the oppression of the hacendados, so Zapata led an armed force to take the land back for the Indians. It is a brutal history, but I feel the need to honor the courage of Zapata and the Indians who struggled persistently to defend their rights.   However, with that, we should remind ourselves the importance of non-violence in our struggles. Mad homage to passive resistence and civil disobedience (but to the Black Bloc, "un-arresting" is pretty damn cool).  "Conquer the angry man by love. Conquer the ill-natured man by goodness. Conquer the miser with generosity. Conquer the liar with truth." The Dhammapada
