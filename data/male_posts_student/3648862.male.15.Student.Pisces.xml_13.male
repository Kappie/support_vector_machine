It makes me want to become a movie scorer. The Romeo and Juliet theme is one of my favorite songs. Its full of sorrow and heartbreak. It makes me want to cry everytime I hear it. Now look what I'm talking about. I'm gayer than I thought I was. I hate being gay, I wish that I could just say that I don't want to be gay and it could be a reality. Pat is finally here, he's one of my friends cousin. He's really hot, my age, and is a soccer player. WooHoo!! Wish me luck everyone!! I'm trying to keep my problems out of my blog, because it gets really boring and some people don't like it. *cough, cough*   Today I played alot of soccer and basketball. The day went by fast and I enjoyed most of it. I think I have a caffien addiction, I drank 5 cans in the past 4 hours. I really don't care about my body, so it doesn't matter what I do. I'm gonna go put a curse on some of my friends. TTYL
