His comments come as Europeans voted in major EU parliament elections yesterday. In France, the  Socialist Party  was largely ahead which of course means:  "let's create the United States of Europe because we can't let those American fascists rule the world, let's put our commie ideology in there!"   Glassman's commentary depicts the realities that Europe faces today: a  rotten economy , a  dying social system , and people wanting change but without taking any risk.   urlLink AEI: Europe, a fool's paradise
