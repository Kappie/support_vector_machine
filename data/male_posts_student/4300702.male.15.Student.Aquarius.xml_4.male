Everyone has seen crappy commercials, so I thought, why not do the  best of the best?!?!  So that's exactly what I'm going to do. I'll just watch TV on different channels every half hour, so it should turn out allot of crap! I'll post my results later tonight!  Stay.. Or don't.. Tuned . (what a bad pun).
