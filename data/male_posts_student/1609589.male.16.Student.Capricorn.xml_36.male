I honestly don't know how the tormented rantings of a demented, misunderstood teenager could make someone's day, but hey, whatever floats your boat, right?  I don't think I've ever used that expression before. "Floats your boat." Good for me.  "Hey, Joe, Let's go see Legally Blonde 2!" "Uhh... Whatever floats your boat, Bob! I'll... just be... over... here.... by the door.... yeah...  Guess what, everybody!?!? my cd burner works now i think! Right now I'm burning the Blue Man album(there i go again...) so i'm back in action if this cd works! Wheeee!!
