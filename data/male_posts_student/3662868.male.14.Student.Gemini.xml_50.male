I'd like to give a thank you/shout out to grimes (Jake), for showing me how stupid I can be and not supporting me when I was bitching about stuff. I'd like to thank eek (Erik) for being there and playing yr and having fun and stuff with me...      Then I was thinking about the people who hate me, or maybe don't, but those of you who are wondering :"What keeps him going?" Well...She knows who she is. She's great. She supports me. Helps me see things in more than one spectrum. Backs me up. And talks to me when I really need someone. No this ain't my mom I'm talkin about you assholes. Anyways, she knows who she is, and I hope she reads this.      Then there are those of you that are kinda there. There when it's important.   There when I have no one else to turn to. Thank you to you guys also.      You might be thinking: "Why all the thankyou's? Is he planning to kill himself?"    Well, no. I'm just thinking : say what you've got to say today, because tomorrow might not come.
