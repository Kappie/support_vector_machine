Anyways she told me that since Lauren's moving on then I should too. Shawna's here and she likes me a lot, so that helps I guess. Then today she told me some stuff about Crystal that made me feel even happier. So today was the absolute best day I've had in nearly a month and a half. That and I feel good. I don't feel sick, I stopped having dreams about the people I love or care most about dying before my eyes because of me, and the fact that I'm beggining to return to my normal, happy/quiet/don't mess with me or i'll kill you, self. Which is good, cause, well I'm not sure why, it just is. Oh that and my freakin appetite is back from where ever it went and is making me wanna consume all the food in the house.So for now, life seems like it might get better, but I've learned not to get my hopes up about anything. I haven't talked to Markita in a while and she hasn't written her blog thing in a few days, hope she's okay, though with her its probably nothing and she's just so busy with school, ROTC, her band, and maybe a boyfriend, that she's lacking the time to do things. I read Amy's blog thing and its nice to know she at least apologized to me for, well I'm not sure she knows what, and that she's also getting along so well with life. I got a few written letters from Crystal, that i have to write her back for. Hold on the stupid door bells ringing........Okay, so I just got done talking to Shawna. She wanted to talk a bit. Then she told me to go to her house tomarrow so we can 'hang out'. Yea,...right. Nah, I won't--, we won't do anything. All we'll probably do is sit there on her freakin couch under a freakin blanket and watch some movie I don't even like. Oh well, its the price I pay for being a guy. Shawna's cool. I mean her parents are kinda strict, and her whole family is "church goin folk". She's got the whole "church-girl"   thing with her. She told me she's had 5 boyfriends, but she's never made out with a guy. I met her parents at Military Ball, and they told her later that they liked me, which she then told me. Which is a bonus, I guess. I dunno though, I think I'd rather keep a friendly relationship with her and not pursue anything else. Kinda hard when she's tried to kiss you three times. Okay, well I better get goin, I'm cooking, yea, proabaly not a "manly" thing to do, but here's what you can do about it:  G.F.Y!
