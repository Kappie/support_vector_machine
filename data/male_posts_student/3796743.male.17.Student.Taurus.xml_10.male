I've now seen it twice. Kris got me better seats this time though. 3rd row. But I saw it because she was an understudy and so Sunday matinee was the understudy performance. She was good, everybody was...so that was fun. I hung around afterwards to see the awards cerimony and then hung out with Emmy for a few minutes. So we were talkin and all right and Jeff Kingsbury comes up to me and starts talkin to me...basically he said I should tech a show this summer....heh...Emmy says thats not a good idea and someone might get hurt...but I think I should try it...maybe. But I don't own that much black clothing...so I'd have to go shopping!  Well today, I woke up sooooo early. 8 AM! I know, well Alex and Emily wanted to go to get coffee...in DuPont! Thats like 20 miles from home! I got to be the driver! Lucky me! Anyways the coffee wasn't even that good, but all they did was rave about it before. Anyways, we were half-way to Tacoma, so we decided it would be a good idea to go to the Tacoma Mall. So we did. It was fun, we walked around the entire mall. Good stuff. Then we came home. Emmy went home to sleep and Alex and I hung out for several more hours. It was good times. Then I came home and spent two hours trying to make my sister's computer work, which it finally did....God Bless America. That was my day! Good times huh?!   Well, Here's a little bit of quotage for you....  "I don't get many things right the first time, In fact, I am told that a lot, Now I know all the wrong turns, the stumbles and falls, Brought me here."  The story of my life.... Till Later....
