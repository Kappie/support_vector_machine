After canceling the show for Lubbock pretty much on the way, pissing everyone off, and wasting about an hour of everyone's time...I went a head and took Brian's drums to him.  I thought it would be nice to eat some dinner with my brother and hang out so I asked him to come along to get some food and I would by him some dinner.  He was down, but he also invited his friends....well, my mind changed because that wasn't really what I wanted to do...so I totally confused him but oh well.  I got on the road wanted to talk to some one about the events, I called up my parents, and then just decided to roll on over there.  I was there for about two hours just talking about this and that.  I invited them to come up this weekend...so maybe I will see them around tomorrow.  I want to take them to this awesome greek place in lewisville that I know they will just love.  Plus, I think my dad is going to bring the Vespa P200 frame that I bought for Brian like almost a year ago.  I think it will be better off in my garage than just sitting in the back of their yard.   Today has totally rocked so far...  I slept till 9 a.m. which was really nice.  For the last month it seems that there hasn't been one weekend that I could just sleep in my bed without doing much of anything.  I would have slept longer but Robert(co-worker) called to let me know they were going to be up at the office going over the Saturday system backup procedures at around 10am.  I needed to be there.  I sat around, checked my email, got dressed and went up to the office. It was a pretty quick ordeal. I spent about an hour there going over all the stuff that needs to be done every Saturday.  New responsibilities...fun.  While I was away, mimi had gone up to Planet Tan to bake herself for a few minutes...she happened to get home at the exact same time I did.  So we went and got some food and went to Target where I bought a "boombox" for the garage.    I spent the rest of the afternoon cleaning up the garage.  I took a whole gallon of bleach and poured it on the floor of my garage.  The fumes where so intense that I couldn't breath or see.  My eyes were watering so bad I had to go outside to get any air worth breathing.  Some how I managed to sweep it all out and I used a fan to help dry it.  After all that mess I spent about 4 hours working on the dismatleing of my Vespa engine. That went Ok for the most part, I had a few problems with a few bolts....some of these problems are still pending.  It was pretty frustrating. I had to go to home depot to pick up a wrench....the real reason was to take a break from the engine. I was about to give my self a heart attack, I just get worked up over shit way to easy.  I feel like I made some head way on the project so that is cool. The real pay off is when I start putting it back together.  That is where I bet it'll get super tough. Around 7pm I am finishing up the laundry and I call up my Uncle Scott who lives right down the street.  His wife, Carrie, was going to a movie so he was going to just be sitting around the house for a few hours with their little baby boy, andrew.  I went over there for a few hours and talked about all kinds of stuff.  I really dig Scott because he reads alot and has alot of interesting view points and I like to hear what he has to say about things.  Anyways, I should be going to sleep soon.  mimi and I are getting up in the middle of the night to go watch the meteor shower.
