There are only like two available dishwashers so we have to work alot, but the good news is we finally hired a new guy who I will be training tomorrow.  Side note, one of the bus girls broke up with her bf who she had been going out with for awhile, and he is pretending to still be going out with her....thats  creepy .  So, finally decided that I will goto the warped tour, all i need to do is get tickets and stuff.  What else...hmmm...  Here are the upcoming concerts I am going to or hoping to go to:   Warped Tour  Aug. 15   Before I Go, Designed By You, Alucard  and more Knights of Colombus Aug 21   SUICIDE MACHINES  w/  Planet Smashers ,  Just Ask , and  The Transfer  Sept 18 Clutch Cargos  Sounds fun.  adios
