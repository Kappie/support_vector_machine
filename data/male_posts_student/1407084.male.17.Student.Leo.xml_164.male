     
      roses fade and rot with time but memories never die a complicated mess of thoughts refreshes the will to try off and on and off throughout the path is quite direct but obstacles and roadblocks remove you from the track it's understood love can't be forced but my heart I give to you and maybe sometime, now or later you will come through too
