Sept. 11 ... was something beyond the realm of imagination, and George Bush ... led us through one of the darkest moments in history." but obviously, something as rational as support for the president (that probably equalled or exceeded the dissension) isn't catchy enough for an article title.  now, let's move on to our godawful history book. it's even lacking in terms of actually covering history. there are so many facets and battles and personalities that LAST YEAR's book (1/2 the size) had more information about. hmm, even though world war ii was the 2nd most devastating event in our history, let's give it one chapter and let's give depression-era america three! then, we have the authors' sanctimonious preaching. in the preface they blather on about how wonderful the book is and how they've incorporated criticisms to improve such and such. they added "the ambiguous impact of industrialization on the independence of single women." two problems. (1): you're devoting page space in a concrete "history book" to something ambiguous? what the fuck, mates, so basically we're memorizing hypotheticals and your philosophical bitchings. (2) did you ever ask those single women what was the ambiguous impact of industrialization on their independence? what i see is, they found two illegible "primary sources" from women of the time, and then they turned around and made it a blanket description of the ENTIRE FUCKING CATEGORY. how else do you get this BULLshit about how latinos (exactly what percentage? hmm sorry we forgot...) felt like true americans because they served in world war ii? the book ignores the country's near-affair with fdr, instead taking every new column in chapter 28 to mention how photogenic eisenhower's smile was. they bitch about how we get tangled in too many affairs in latin america, but when we lose china to the communists it's OUR fault for not being more involved. they blow up 20,000 in the naacp to encompass every person in the world with tan skin, they blow up a curiosity in communism into "all americans were strongly tempted by the wonders of the reds!" every chapter, women and blacks find new resolve to gain independence...in that case they must've taken over the world by now. then the authors have the nerve to complain that the media and new houses and electric dishwashers magically instill conformity, when kids in colleges and high schools across the country are all reading the SAME GODDAMN SELF-RIGHTEOUS BOOK. SHUT UP.   oh yeah, i have to finish off with the great change of pace in english we call  urlLink mama day . at least it beats either another meandering 19th century adventure into parts unknown or cultural novel written by someone of color espousing the splendiferous uniqueness of their race. but then i take offense to gloria naylor's pretentious belief that she can write like both a man or a woman...hell, she actually thinks she writes like a real person. blah blah blah, i'm a man that comes off as nearly autistic (see, i use slide rules to measure out your closet space, just like every person in the world with external reproductive organs) and i think football is so manly because of all this intangibles and engineering crap. blah blah blah, i'm a woman and i'm so womanly because i'm loud and caustic on the outside but deep down i'm soft and vulnerable and only want you to love me for who i REALLY AM, and that's a loud and caustic bitch. therefore let's bite off hemingway and make our conversations as inane and robotic-sounding as possible! "it's just that you're a little confused. and i'm really flattered that i mean enough to you to be part of that confusion." SHUT UP.
