Now, I assume that you are currently straining your brain to learn what ExFuGa is. Well, too bad. I'm not telling you....Ok, fine. I'll tell you, but only 'cause I'm nice. Now, here goes:     ExFuGa   is website on the internet. It stands for Extremely Fun Games, although it has none of that description...but that's not the point. The main exfuga feature is the Exfuga forum. If you don't know what a forum is, well, too bad. Anyway, it was made   from scratch   by Timmy weichselbaum (exfuga-name: timmy) about a year ago at age 12, and is still being improved. The current exfuga staff are Timmy Weichselbaum, Zack (exfuga-name: The1andonlyZack), Jeff (exfuga-name: Jeff), Butters (exfuga-name: butters), and Chris Weichselbaum (exfuga-name: Chris). They are all very good admins, although lately Zack has been on a banning spree (to which I happened to fall victim to). Timmy is a very interesting human being, who I happen to know in person. He has an abnormal habit of doing things very unpredictably, which spawns from his unpredictable personality. Zack, who I also know in person, is a person who engages consistently in the art of arguing and insulting. He also believes me to be utterly clueless, which is completely incorrect, as you can palpably see. Jeff, from what I know of him, has good morals, excluding the one about wanting to have a child with his girlfriend. Butters is my favorite staff member. He will quickly come to the rescue of a fellow exfugian from the wrath of Zack or Sam (exfuga-name: sam), whether by unbanning him/her from the forum, or by making a useless, yet senseful, comment towards the insulter. Chris is a very mysterious person who, although timmy's brother, does not consistently show up on exfuga, except to ask Sam why I [Billyfox] should not use jpegs.    We also have the exfugian long-time regulars: Pearl (exfuga-name: pearl), Sam, Pokemon (exfuga-name: PokemonMaster), kuietlu (exfuga-name: kuietlu), Anthony (exfuga-name: Anthony Kid), Bill (exfuga-name: Bill), and Cross (exfuga-name: Cross). Pearl, a former exfugian admin, is an interesting character. I'd consider her the comic relief of the forum. Zach, on the other hand, would probably consider her, plainly said, dumb. Sam, being timmy's best friend, gets extra rights that even the admins don't get (although he does not get the admin rights himself). For example, timmy often will give him passwords to other people's accounts, although not so much anymore. Hence the reason he is the scapegoat for everything stolen from other exfugians. Along with his privileges, Sam is an altogether messed-up guy who will never refrain from finding reasons to use the word "dumass", or the phrase "STFU Bill". Hence the reason we say that if every person that he said "STFU Bill" were banned, there would be no one left on exfuga. Pokemon, along with being Pearls younger sister, acts just the way she should at her age: like an 8-year old. Kuietlu is a  really  messed up guy that I'd rather not talk about. Anthony is a computer wiz. After being permenantly banned from exfuga, and then having his original exfuga-name (Anthony_Kid) deleted, he now goes by multiple aliases, including "Anthony Kid" and "Fabulous_Hottie". Bill is the owner of a site called  urlLink MishkinEvil . After being permanently banned multiple times, he now uses the forum with various aliases, including "Paris Hilton" and "Linustorvalds". Cross is the only person who currently uses exfuga that lives in Australia. Besides that, I can't tell u much else about him.    Along with the forum, exfuga also has a battle system (which is down at the moment), a lottery, exfugian shops, clans, a bank, stocks, an auction, and a few games.    Ladies and gentlemen, it was nice meeting you. I will be back soon to report on the goings-on of ExFuGa.com.       My exfuga-name: IarcayanAmnia; HiTim (not in use)    A good exfuga-name to put in the "refered-by" box if not mine: fongvoltfan *    Another good exfuga-name to put in the "refered-by" box if not mine: bill *                  *Do this at your own risk
