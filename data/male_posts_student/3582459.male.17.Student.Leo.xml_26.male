Between 1993 and 2002, the percentage of Americans that calls itself "Protestant" has declined about 11%.   Historically, about 63% of Americans have been Protestants. The article suggests that the majority of people who have lost their faith have basically become agnostic/atheist/nonreligious.    (This does not mean that the United States will have ceased to be a "Christian nation," however;  Christians--Protestants and Catholics--will still have about a 70% majority in the United States.  I don't really know why Protestant Christianity has lost so many people, and this particular topic seems too narrow for me to write on without doing any real research. What is easier for me to write about is that this ongoing secularization of the modern United States brings us one step closer to post-Christian Western Europe. Basically, I see the United States going down the path of secularization, mixed market economics (some would call this socialism), and greater trust in the federal government as "protector."  Stub for secularization to be filled in later  In spite of all the claims of "fiscal conservatism" flying around in politics today, my country is beginning to show signs of Western European-style mixed-market economics, epitomized by recently (by recently I mean the past few years) enacted prescription drug coverage, and bipartisan calls for universal healthcare. To be elaborated on later  Stub for greater federal power and involvement to be filled in later
