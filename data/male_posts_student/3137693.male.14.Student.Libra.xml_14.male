So here it is: In June me and my family are going to Russia to adopt a 8 month old baby girl.   I've been so excited about this, i've always wanted another sibling to replace my current sister since i think she was a lemon of a sister. haha just kidding, anyways we are going there about the 3-4th week of june for 2 weeks, im going to take pictures and we are shooting video there about the whole thing, its goin national and its hosted by yours truely.
