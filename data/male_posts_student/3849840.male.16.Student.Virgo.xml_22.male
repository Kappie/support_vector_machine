Plus you have to pay any unpaid fees before you get your new scheduales!! "  Info. stolen from  urlLink Rachel .    Sigh, I really hate comming back to Anniston.  I'm just comming for the orientation and then i'm comming back. [PCB,FL] *giggles* Bringing Alesha back with me.  As Rachel found out when she came down with her church, sometimes I get extremely lonely.  Especially during the day when Fat Granny is at work. -_-
