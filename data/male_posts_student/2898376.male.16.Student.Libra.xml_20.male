Though I am now able to watch the schools pragrammes. Ah, happy days...remember when Teach put your class in front of the telly, with something about 'Magic E' playing, and it wasn't a warning about drugs? Well, I now have the liberty of learning about it all again. I've seen Maths Mansion in which a frankly deranged aristocrat kidnaps cheery 8-year-olds and says something like ;'Mwahaha!!! You'll never get out of my Maths Mansion this week, kids! The Maths Maze is ... Long Division!!' Then a helpful bloke comes along, the kids learn how to do division, get past the Maths Maze, and escape. Brilliant. Today's highlight was MegaMaths:  Schools: Megamaths Tue 25 May, 11:10 am - 11:30 am  20mins  [Age 7-9] Division. Divide by 3: The King of Spades discovers his ancestors' treasure chest and he and his wife and daughter attempt to divide its contents by three.  Truly excellent. A bunch of people dressed as the King of Hearts, Queen of Spades, live in Tabletop Mountain, where they are amused by acrobats with numbers on them, who dance about, dividing each other, much to everyone's delight. Production values are pretty good. They stretched out dividing by three over half an hour. But no final comment of 'And next week, integration: Integrate between 4 and -2 for 4x - x^2 - (x^2 - 16) dx !  P.s. You may also notice that I have, after some help from  urlLink Megatrobe , I have managed to enable YOU, the lucky reader, to comment on my Blog. You can also mail me, by looking to the left, coping and pasting my E-mail address, taking out the rubbish (*'s and spaces). Anyway, do what thou willst.
