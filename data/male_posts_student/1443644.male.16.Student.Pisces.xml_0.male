My boss never calls me in, leading my parents to believe that i am wasting away my summer. It really appears that way, but it isn't my fault i listened to my boss and kept my summer open so i could work for her. Man, this sucks! So today i woke up early, didn't feel like getting out of bed, so i layed in bed for about three hours. I then got up and got ready for my big day... Of doing nothing. After I drank a bottle of water i was inspired to take advantage of the beautiful weather and go for a walk down town. My walk was very energizing, and motivating. While downtown i went to Dunkin Donuts and got a vanilla bean coolata before heading down to Subway for a BLT without the T. Over all it was a wonderful adventure. I saw Jaimie K infront of Adams, I was so happy to see her, i have't seen her since the end of school, which really sucks cause she is a great person... i miss her, her Hooters shirt, and her poncho so much! Walking along the streets of Monson really helped me do some deep soul searching. I realized that i really don't like BLT's, even if there is no T. I also realized that i am very confused when it comes to making decisions about my future. I really have to start thinking about colleges and various areas of interest that i wouldnt mind dedicating my life to. I don't know what's going on. I have felt extremely lonely lately, and just so out of it. Anyways, I had rehearsal for Summer Theater again this evening. Another night filled with dancing my heart out, man i can't wait for it to end.  *I just wanted to appologize for last night's post, i was having a rough evening and had to vent. I didn't mean to hurt anyone, or cause any hooplah.
