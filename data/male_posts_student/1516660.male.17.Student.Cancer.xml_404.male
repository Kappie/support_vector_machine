Wheee! 7th July is upon us all again! Isn't it wonderful? O.O!!   Okay. Today's the starting of the school term. Sigh. Here we are again. Doomed to wake up as early as 5:30, being groggy and all, and before you know it, you are inside a building with thousand more like-beings being forced to learn theories and what-have-you.   Right. Okay. Today we only got back Maths. I passed by 1 mark, barely scrapping it! I am so happy! Weee! Heh.  Right. In Chinese, I was told that my compo did not li ti. Run away from the topic. YAY!   After school, me, CQ and Gloria went to Causeway Point to eat lunch, after that going home. Heh.   Okay la. There was no celebration today. Heh Heh. A lot of cats did wish me "Happy Birthday", so I am very happy. :)   Yeah. Oh yes! I am supposed to collect my present from Wendy. :) I wonder what she got me, even though I got a pretty shrewd idea. Heh heh. Wendy! Don't forget to lend me the W.I.T.C.H. comics ar! I really need to catch up. HaHa!   Okay. I am really really tired. I think I should go sleep soon. Yeah. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!
