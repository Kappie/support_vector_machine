Is it that he had a fetish with papers as the democrats are trying to say.  Is this really something that we should all "laugh about" as Bill Clinton suggests?  Or was it just "sloppy" handling of papers on Berger’s part?    Seriously people, I’m not making this stuff up.  These are the actual reasons and excuses  the Democratic Party is presenting to the public for Sandy Berger’s "sloppy mistake."  And if these lame excuses aren’t enough; The Democrats are also accusing the GOP of leaking the information about Berger to the press, in an attempt to overshadow the final report of the 9/11 Commission.    This is what real liberals do.  When in trouble themselves, they go on the offensive, attacking Republicans for something the GOP had nothing to do with.    It’s also interesting to mention that Berger was an advisor to the Kerry campaign.  He has since stepped down. (Smart move Sandy)  It’s not so far fetched to think that a Kerry advisor with a paper fetish, would be sent to steal classified information that could be used in attacks against the Bush campaign, is it now?    I guess having "extra" things in one's pants is common in the Clinton administration.  Bubba couldn't keep Monica out of his pants.  Now we come to find that Sandy Berger likes to be "close to papers," as one Democratic spokesman puts it.    A federal investigation of Sandy Berger is pending.  More on this developing story to come...  Thanks to Lacy for the catchy title.
