Regular readers of this blog (all four of you), as well as new readers who read the "Comments" section of the previous post, will know that I was recently requested to hold forth with my views on DEVO for an entire week's worth of posts.  Around here a "week's worth" of posts averages out to maybe a paragraph, so I'm just going to go all-out and hit you with an  entire  DEVO-related post!    Understand, dear readers, that this is quite an impressive sacrifice which I am making for this blog.  In the course of researching this post I have listened to, and therefore handled, the four most indispensable DEVO albums,  Are We Not Men? ,  Duty Now For The Future ,  New Traditionalists , and of course  Freedom Of Choice .  That's right, four.  That's a lot of DEVO.  Here's the sacrifice part:  DEVO, not only independently but also by dint of their association with 1981 cartoon titty-bomb  urlLink  Heavy Metal  , are inextricably infected with the taint of total geekdom.  The practical ramification of this is that, each time you handle, let alone listen to, a DEVO album, you must make your save vs. breath weapon or girls will avoid you for 1d20 days per album.  In the unlikely event that you are a girl with access to both DEVO albums and a 20-sided die, you must immediately buy 1d4 more cats.  Now, an astute reader, not having been turned off by the rampant dorkery manifested in the previous paragraph, has probably begun speculating about the main point of this article.  "Aha," he or she is thinking, "this is the part where Mr. Frankfurt School  manqu√©  starts to bitch about the fascist implications of 'Triumph Of The Will' and 'Gates Of Steel'". Wrong, smartass!  I find the casually sexist implications of "Pink Pussy Cat", "Jerkin' Back And Forth", and "Come Back Jonee" (you heard me) far more troubling than the obviously intentional attitude-mongering of those other songs, and at any rate it's not all neo- urlLink Baffler ian cultural polemic here at This Is Not A Fugazi T-Shirt.  If I were looking for a point of entry on that topic, I would start by noting that DEVO's skewering of the gray-flannel-suited 1950's vintage executive type, already dated by their late-'70s/early-'80s heyday, served to conceal corporate America's unending attempts to coopt, reify, and neutralize countercultural and populist streams of American thought by disguising itself and its product to conform stylistically to perceived "outsider" and "cutting edge" culture, and indeed by propagating "cutting edge" culture itself;  planned obsolescence drives cultural markets as much as material ones.  Remember the Monkees*?  Remember the Knack**?  Remember the Strokes***?  I would go on to point out however that despite its signing to Warner Brothers Records, DEVO probably avoided total cooptation simply by being too dorky and uncool for their image to be worth marketing.  But I'm not going to do that today.     Oh wait.  Moving right along.  Some people would have you believe that DEVO's greatness, or at least their DEVO-y goodness, lies entirely in their sonic embodiment of the gawky misanthropic nerd, in the way that "Whip It" [the first record I ever owned (thanks Mom)] or "Shrivel-up" bend and twist uneasily like some kid whose growth spurt only hit half of him.  That's certainly part of it.  But in overemphasizing the overtly dorkish aspects of DEVO's sound (the synthesizers, the monotone nasal chanting, the nervously twitching drums) we ignore what it is that compels people to continue to listen to DEVO again and again long after their moment in the sun has passed.  It's obvious, isn't it?  DEVO rock.  You can turn up DEVO albums and shout along with them on long car rides, and  other people will join in .     They outlasted the most eminent groups of their moment and even some of the most critically-respected.  When they finally foundered ( EZ Listening Disc ), they had left a legacy at least as great as that of Pere Ubu (especially their nineties output, JEBUS KEE-RIST) or the Cars.  DEVO's cultural impact is immense.  Let's consider a few of their major achievements.   The favorite band of  urlLink Indiana's favorite son .   Wrote the song which inspired one of MTV's  urlLink early forays into keeping music videos off the TV .   Awakened Americans to the danger posed by spending too long in Ohio, a state so shitty that even Indianans hate it.   _____ *Speaking as someone who enjoys listening to "Steppin' Stone", even the original. **Speaking as someone who enjoys listening to "My Sharona". ***Speaking as someone who FUCKING DESPISES "12:51", and all the other ones too.  There are very few songs named after numbers that are any good at all.  Gang of Four wrote two of them.
