Modest Mouse's CD "The Moon and Antartica" struck a chord the first time I listened to it... I instantly fell in love with the songs like 3rd Planet, A Wild Pack of Family Dogs(LOL), and Paper Thin Walls. I love the style of music, I can't seem to find out what I should call it, and the great catchy lyrics and guitar riffs. I would give this CD a 9/10. I love this CD!
