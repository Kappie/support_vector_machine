"ZEL" was on the cover, bold, in  thick black marker. The interior was covered in cotton wool, stuck on with glue. There was red and gold fine glitter sprinkles too. Diagonally, I placed a single red rose. It was fresh and damp. It was alive. The silver chain was wound round the stalk and the crystal was in the rose.   I still remember what she said. I didn't expect it. I had hoped for better. A hug perhaps? She didn't have to say anything. It wasn't necessary. She could have looked me in the eye. That would have been nice. Never the less, I got an "OH! COOL!".    She told me that she hid it in betwen some clothes. If I recall correctly. And that her mom found it and asked her where the pretty necklace came from. She lied- said it was old and that she'd forgotten who'd given it to her. Maybe this was the kind of lie that she got tired of telling. The details of the red rose were falsified too. Apparently the boys in her class gave roses to all the girls. They must have been pretty rich to buy so many roses on valentines day.  As for the box? The one which I spent slightly more than 2 hours on, sticking, blow-drying with my mom's hair dryer and sprinkling glitter into. That one she couldn't keep. It was chucked in my class bin. She didn't really look at it.  The boys played after class. Leon, Jed, Dan Ngui, Cheam, Squirt, Sze Yuan, Joel and I. I can't remember if there was anyone else. We tore out the cotton wool and threw it about. Rubbed it onto each other's backs and and navy blue pants. It really stuck. Helluva clean up job after that. Wow, the human memory is a remarkable thing.  It all became worth it today. She messaged me, which she never did, even when we were one, and said "I was looking at the necklace you gave me. It's beautiful".  I am happy.
