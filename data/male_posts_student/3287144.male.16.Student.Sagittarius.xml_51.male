Personally I didn't know of its existence until this morning.  Anyway, unlike yesterday where I was waiting for a call, today I am waiting for a parcel and with a bit of luck it should arrive soon containing  urlLink Joss Stone's  album.  As it is very early I can also remember my dream from last night; I have got a job in an office for a couple of weeks and it is my first day, I go to the third floor in the lift with a German, I don't know much German but I manage to answer his question of 'how did you get here?' by saying 'by foot'. I then go around trying to find my office but realize that I haven't a clue where it is and so after a while I decide to take the bus back home, except now I have no shoes so I am stuck in this office. While walking around looking for my shoes a man falls down the stairs and opens a cupboard before dying, there I see my shoes and my army jacket [why I don't know] but they are taken from me as part of the death before I can claim them. Anyway yesterday I read that they will be adding more domains; soon Star Trek fans might be able to be it www.geeks.klingon etc, well I had a small brainwave, why not move all those dodgy websites which you find yourself on if you type an address wrong to being at a .con address, that way they get to have the exact address and only those who miss type an 'm' and put 'n' will find themselves there [which is probably just me]. I know it is flawed in that no one would want to have a .con as no one would want to go to it, but its a nice idea to thing that all those pyramid schemes and 'manhood' enlargers could be in one place where no one dare goes.
