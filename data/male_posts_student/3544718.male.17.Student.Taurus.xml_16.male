I love technology because I can send receive pictures with my friends. I love technology because I can e-mail my friends, and receive e-mails from them. I have a web-cam, and I use a microphone to chat.  However, technology seems to not work as much as it should. I might think this because it decides not to work at inopportune times. Well, I guess nothing's perfect, and technology is a great thing... when it works.   That reminds me... I'm hungry...
