It's probably his voice, but *shrugs*.  I love the semicolon; it's cool, isn't it?  I am much too distracted. Period.  New paragraph. New sentence. I went to work today and got some stuff done; less than I would have liked, but you know, you can't have it all. You can't just go to work for 7 hours, goof off for 3 of 'em and expect to get 5 hours out. Well, actually where I work, you can. You just have to arrange the goofing off properly. Between every mask, there's a period from about 3 to 30 minutes or more that you have to spend waiting for the computer to do some calculations with the data you manipulated and generate new file based on it, upon which you work and proceed to the next stage until you have 3D models of each hemisphere. It's so cool and exciting. I feel sexy*.  Moving on, after work my mom and sister (younger) picked me up (no car and no money for bus fare) and dragged me to the Laundromat. It was kind of surreal. I had been to the laundromat before, but it felt different this time. This time it felt like I was in a movie or a cheesy television show. Ya know, the ones where like the more-likely-than-not normal dude's just sitting there with a magazine, maybe some headphones waiting for his load to be done and this hot lady walks by and she looks at him all sexily and you know where it goes from there**...  Anyway, no hot ladies walked by and I just sat there wearing my usual outfit of a soccer jersey and gap relaxed fit light blue jeans (I'd put a picture up, but my camera's being retarded***) with big ol' dorky looking (They're ugly, but they sound damn good)  urlLink Bose Triport  headphones bobbing my head to the beat of The Get Up Kids and Death Cab For Cutie. The whole thing felt very odd.  Oops, I left something out. We went to get something to eat before we went to do the laundry. I work at UCLA, as you know, which as you may not know is in Westwood. In Westwood, there is an  urlLink In-N-Out **** and my sister wanted to get something to eat there. Knowing our family's tight financial situation and the incompetence in "doing the math", I recommended we order strategically at  urlLink Jack-In-The-Box , but Noooo! Ol' Javaneh***** is too good for Jacky and decides that she HAS to have In-N-Out so we stop there and spend like 7 bucks feeding 1 person; that's just way too much for fast food! With 8 dollars, you can feed 3 people comfortably at Jack's if you order properly. Anyway, my mom and I decided not to order anything and hold out until we saw something more reasonable.  On our way to the laundromat, we passed a Pizza Hut and I spotted a deal that said 6 bucks for a large pizza on Mondays. So, it being Monday, we stopped and got a large mushroom pizza from which we all took at least two slices. Now,  that's  what I call strategic eating. Ya see, all you have to do is draw out a game plan before you order and you end up with A LOT less waste. I am good. Being cheap is unattractive, I know. And Pizza Hut isn't the healthiest thing around, I know. And we could have just eaten something healthier at home for a fraction of the cost, I know. But try and get two whiney women on their periods who haven't eaten all day to wait 2+ hours for food. Bad move.  Anyway, I think that just about covers it. Sigh. I'm probably boring everyone who reads these things. I don't think that most people are as charmed by the everyday things that happen in one's life as I am. And I also bet that what everyone's been saying for the past four years is true (they all say I'm gay), but there's one problem with that. I've only had girlfriends and I don't get into men. With friends and family like this, who needs assholes and bitches?  Whoa, I just reread the post before I published it and it's not entirely coherent. Thanks for reading this far (and if you skipped to the bottom of the post then shame on you! Go read the rest! :-P). Oh, and I'm actually not cheap, I've always managed my personal funds such that I have a large balance after a while that I spend on something big. I just try to reduce waste when possible. Take that how you like, but I   know   that I'm not cheap.  That is all. -- Feanor  * This is not your standard issue sexy. This is the kind of sexy that means "cool" or "good" or "confident" or "fun" or "fill-in-possitive-state/feeling-here". It has nothing to do with being sexually appealing or tantalizing.  ** At least I hope you do. If you don't, get out more... No, wait, stay in and watch some crappy TV to see what I mean.  *** The switch to change the modes between picture taking, movie taking, and displaying broke so it's stuck in display mode until I get it fixed... or come up with a cheap hack.  **** Also worth checking out is their secret menu:  urlLink Secret Menu   ***** Younger sister.

I don't know anything about the rising sign and stuff like that, so you'll have to figure that out yourself.
