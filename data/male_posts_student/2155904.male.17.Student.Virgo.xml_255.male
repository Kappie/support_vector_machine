And it was actually a relief for Tyke's parents that everyone was leaving as well. Cuz it just was a hassle. Tyke and his dad also went to the Mariners game at 1 so they left right before everyone actually left. Good timing it turns out. The Mariners game was a good one too so that was an added bonus. The weather started out poor but it ended up being quite nice by like the 7th inning. The Mariners won pretty easily and there were some exciting plays so it was just a Winn-win situation. After the game Tyke came home and he and his parents talked about the family and how his mom isn't even going to try with the get-togethers anymore. She'll still see her family but she isn't going to make an effort to have everybody over again. It just doesn't work. She got quite annoyed by her mother many times in the 2 days and she even said, "If I get like that when I'm older, shoot me." Harsh words but they were warranted. So they talked about that for a little and Tyke mentioned how his parents are actually totally cool. Sure there is a bit of a generational gap between them and Tyke but it isn't that big. And they let Tyke do most anything he wants which is pretty cool so Tyke really has it nice. Later on in the evening Tyke had some pizza and did some massive cleaning up downstairs. Way worse than when Tyke has teenage friends over. Dog hair everywhere, sheets all over, towels out of place, it was a sty. But Tyke's cleanliness overtook his laziness and he fixed the place up a little bit. A few hours later, after more yummy cheesecake, Tyke had Dr. Phil and Kinker over. Tyke got a call from Naan later on and her, Dudely Doo, and Ybrad came over. They mostly played PS2 while the other 3 played cards. So there was sorta a split but most everyone was having fun and there was some interaction but it was a little weird come to think of it. Cuz they were all sitting right next to each other but hardly even talking to each other. Tyke won 5 bucks in 31 though. That was cool. Then later on Purdy called which was unexpected but always welcomed. They shared the usual pleasantries and conversed in some common chit-chat and then set up a preliminary meeting for tomorrow. After the phone call and 31 Tyke, Kinker, Dr. Phil, and Macaroon all played Risk. It was a friendly yet spirited affair this time. Lots of battles. Tyke looked pretty strong from the beginning but Dr. Phil made a timely dash and went through Tyke's strong defenses to take his capital and somehow hold it the next turn. It was a battle indeed. Dr. Phil looked strong but then he became weak and then he just took a POW of Macaroon's and that left Macaroon disheartened and out of the game. So basically Kinker ran through the rest of the world shortly thereafter. And now Tyke is just blogging but he does sorta have to be up early in the morning. Well, at least before 1 cuz that's when he's expecting a call. Other than that it's all cool. Ok then, ok.
