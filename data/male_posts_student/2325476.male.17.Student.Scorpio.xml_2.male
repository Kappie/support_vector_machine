I never really had any interest in submitting poetry, cause that's not why i write poetry. Anyway, i was really bored earlier (actually i was taking a break from reading Dante's  Inferno , which is an awesome book), and somehow i ended up taking a quiz on my poetry IQ. I scored 9 out of 11, which is totally irrelevant. Anyway, so the twelfth question on the test is to submit a poem, either something you've already written, or write something, and they'll analyze it and mail you the results. It can be any style of poem you wish to write. Here's the part that pisses me off, and the point of this rant. There's a 20 line limit to the poem. WHAT THE FUCK-ITY FUCK!!!???!!!???! How the FUCK do you put a cap on art?! You might as well say "Paint me a picture of anything that you want, but you can only use three colors", or "write a song, but you can only use major chords" ARGH!!! And yes, i'd love to make you think that im only mad because they're putting a limit on art(art = emotion, so therefore they're putting a limit on emotion), and that is 95% of why im mad, but since i dont write anything with a 20 line limit, my poetry isn't worthy of you?! FUCK you!!
