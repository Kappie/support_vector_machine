I am the first of a great race which i shall build and dominate called the Slamof. I was born in a cabin made entirely from turkey feathers, which is the tradition in Turkey, you can see the coorilation, and was raised by the various woodland animals attracted by my shelter. I suppose i should hate them, for they killed and devoured my parents........squirrels dining on the flesh of humans, a sight i shall never see again........... yet they raised me as there own and for that i love them. When i reached the age of 10 though, they realised me for the freak i am and cast me out of there society. I was found by a dull minded native and thought to be some sort of exquisite new breed of poodle. I was captured and forced into numerous dog shows which i won, not out of honor, but shame. At the age of 12 i broke away from him and travelled to the Americas, for i heard there they hated the french, the people whom sponsered many of those dog shows i was put through. When i reached there i quickly obtained various metal scraps from a junk yard and built myself a robot body in the shape of an average human. Since then i have been living an inconspicuous life under the name Nick and have gathered much information about the human race by going to school. I have made "friends" and many other various alliances through kindness, bribery and blackmail
