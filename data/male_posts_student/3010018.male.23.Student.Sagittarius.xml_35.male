Pretty cool huh ? My brain incorporated the radio broadcast into my dream in a very interesting way........i asked my high school english teacher, Mr. White, what he thought of my dream....Mr. White is a great guy who i talked to alot about my problems and thoughts, he was always receptive and offered great advice......He thought that the dream was a good one, he said that square, circle, 6 cars, 2 people........showed balance, everything in the dream was symetrical........he said not alot of people my age think in a balanced way.......whatever his interpretation was, its always open to new ideas.....a dream is just a dream......you can make as much or as little of it as you choose to..........i asked him about the cocaine, he said it wasnt cocaine but a new experience that i was nervous about.....cocaine was just a symbol for something new.........  another result of being under severe stress and sleep deprivation are hallucinations......after i moved out of my apartment at the end of my junior year of college, i spent a whole night packing up my belongings and moving them into a storage unit....it was alot of stuff and i was doing it all by myself........so when i started driving back home i was exhausted.....i was concentrating really hard to stay awake and concentrate so that i could drive......sometimes when you drive for a long time you fall into a trance and you quickly get out of it.......well i fell into one of those trances for about 45 mins......i drove only 50 miles or so, in the right lane.......but i couldnt recall anything about the last 45 mins.....i dont remember any song that i heard, land marks, or cars, exits......nothing......like i had been asleep for 45 mins while i was driving....but i didnt crash......well i pulled over, got a drink, ate somethin, and got back on the road....the sun went down and driving at night is never easy........as i was driving, i looked in the opposite lane and i swear i thought i saw a truck crash and flip over....but when i turned to look for the crash....there was nothing.......i was shocked......i continued driving.......and out of the corner of my eye i get the feeling that there is someone sitting in the passenger seat of my car......i turn my head to look and no one is there...but i could swear i felt a presence.......after a couple of minutes, i sense a hand moving from the passenger side up to the radio....i turn to look and nothing.......i say outloud "look, if you're cold or dont like the song, just tell me....if you wanna talk, lets talk, im bored, i could use some conversation..." unfortunately the ghost or spirit didnt respond.....it was a cool feeling, but at the same time, i was exhausted and really wanted to sleep.....
