I have packed everything and am ready to go, taxi booked, everything packed into one very large rucksack...and sorted out an old notebook to use as a journal so I can type up the whole thing when I get back.  Apart from that, everything is going well...I need to switch round the drive letters for the CD-ROM drives, one of them is a virtual drive which makes it harder, I need the virtual drive as D so both Lands Of Lore and Earthseige 2 will read the virtual CDs in it, otherwise when I play Earthseige 2 I am distracted (and so is everyone else) by the very loud buzzing/sawing sound of an old CD in a new fast drive.   But, that can wait until I get back...as can anything else, I intend to enjoy working on the Excelsior for the next week.
