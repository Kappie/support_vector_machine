Plunge the depth of your inner springs In search of answers, and there you will find Unknowingly baptized, now to your soul grace clings. A waiting spirit, and to you it is kind.  Religion is only what a book commands? There’s so much more which He filled us with. Our inner soul has so many demands. Blinded, we must be led by blind, is just a myth
