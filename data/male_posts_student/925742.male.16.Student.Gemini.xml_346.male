For instance, my Iron Hand training gave me stronger hands and arms while increasing my ability to feel less pain in my hands.  I want to try to bust a window or something... but that sounds stupid, doesn't it?  I like my showers scaldingly hot.  Well, thats an overstatement.  More like, on the highest setting.  I don't know why.  Maybe it kills more germs?     Either way, to me, if it stings, its probably good for you (EG, Iodine, ah, no better way to know that it works!)  I just slammed my knee into a metal door and made that snarrling noise I tend to make.  You know?  Maybe you don't.  Anyway, it sounds weird.  I won't bother hosting it on my files.  Since its weird.  But after I did that grunt/snarl I just laughed like a maniac.  I shrugged the pain off and walked off.  And it HURT for the first few seconds.  Anyway, I bet if I got into a fight that would definitely help.  Hmmmmm... I caught a moth with my hand.  That was kinda cool.    Less about me being a bad motherfucker, more about me being stressed out.  I had to freaking write 4 poems this week, and finished my story one today.  Goddamn my stress made me write.  I hope its good enough for Mrs. Ogre. I'm sorry I was really angry, time wasting Algebra makes me irritable.  I don't know.... maybe I'm naturally angry?  Or maybe thats yet another one of my psychological reactions to stress.  Excuses, right?  I still need to finish my Algebra 2.  It confounds me sometimes, but other times, when I understand the concept, I don't need practice, its so easy.  Right now with.. umm... exponential stuff, I know what the deal is, but I don't have the time (Hahahah I have the time to vent here, though) to do pointless crap.  Anyway. Stuff calls. Gotta pack my bags.
