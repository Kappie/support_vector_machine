Tommorow I'm going to see the Bourne Supremacy with my friends.  Although this movie was good the movie i really want to see is the village. Shamalan has kept this movie very sercet and the movie looks amazing.  Hopefully it will be as good as i expect and i pray that it is not a disappointer.  lates,  Smog
