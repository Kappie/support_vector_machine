I hear them almost everyday. There are too many bands nowdays. There is a new band named Keane. They sound almost like Coldplay. Both are British bands. Moving away from songs but staying with music by my irritating yet nice loving neighbours  My neighbours are slowly and surely irritating the hell out of me.Why?  My neighbours are part time musicians and full time housing agents. More like the other way round. They have all the musical instruments in their house from drums to guitar to piano. So whats wrong with having musical instruments. nothing wrong rite. But they play it almost everyday and they also sing. They do this all very loudly in a HDB flat. Worse of all, their friends and relatives will come over and sing along with them. Almost every night is like Christmas carol night. My mother always say there they go again. This morning I plan to wake up at ard 12 but I could not. I was awaken by loud drumming and singing.It was only nine and i slept at 4. I dont mind all this singing and drumming. But there is a limit to everything. Anyway my neighbours are actually quite nice people. I must try to get used to their music playing everyday. It is going to be part of my life.
