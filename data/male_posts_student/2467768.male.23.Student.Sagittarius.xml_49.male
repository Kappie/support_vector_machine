The first day it was regarding The Historial Jesus, latter was The Hidden Treasure of Islam. This lecture is held in Liverpool, Whitnam Hall, Sdyney.  A lots of youth attended this occassion. Some of the are not even Muslim yet. The gals are really pretty, I have no comments for that. Always from, I would walk in with a non-muslim gal and covert her for the love of my religion and love.  Ops, I have a girlfriend. I guess she will be reading this. I really so lonely. Witnessing 6 gals accepting Islam, was really one of the gracious time for me... I never seen stuffs like that before.
