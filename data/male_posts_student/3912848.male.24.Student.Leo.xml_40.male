This is a beautiful warm up for the immense USA love that I am about to display in front of my tv while watching the family of NBC networks. urlLink www.usolympicteam.com  The olympics are possibly my favorite expression of sports, and with my well-known love of basketball this is quite a statement. I am thoroughly enjoying the line of commercials currently running that essentially say that "the time has come for all americans to have the same favorite team....team USA, 300,000,000 strong" The olympics join two of my favorite things,  the USA beating the snot out of other countries , and  sports . It must be special, because I will even watch gymnastics as long as the uniforms have USA on them. Now we just need olympic ultimate frisbee, and for the tryouts to be somewhere in the midwest. And now, would you please rise... urlLink www.treefort.org/~rgrogan/web/usa1.htm
