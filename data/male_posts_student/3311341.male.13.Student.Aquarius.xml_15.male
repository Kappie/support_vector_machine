Sometimes I feel better, and I'm often more entertained constantly with the lacking thoughs such as starvation, pain, and death in other parts of the world. Although, when I attempt to meet with God I feel good, such as you do when you meet with the Holy Spirit. But, later, I feel bad because the objects of the world seem so easy to gain and use, like secular games that promote violence or TV shows that contain immoral ideas and suggestions. Sometimes the entertainment promotes with humor, which is probably the best way to advertise something.  Right now, I'm observing South Park, where they impersonate Phil Collins in cartoons and he says "I don't think it's right to laugh at people with disabilities"(with a strained australian accent). Then a man procedes to cross the screen. I don't want to watch it, but it is entertaining. I'd rather be around God, but sometimes it's hard to venture from the distractions of daily activities.  Back to the "falling up" thing. I feel like I'm getting better at achieving in life, but I'm decreasing God's importance. I know that I shouldn't be doing this, and I feel guilty because of it, but... It's hard to explain something when you can't even figure it out yourself, ya' know?
