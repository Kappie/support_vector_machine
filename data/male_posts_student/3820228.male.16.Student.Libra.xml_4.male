First, we went to Fred Meyer and I tried on these really slick pair of skateboard shoes by "NSS Preformance". I don't know how to skateboard but these were tight! They looked hella-good on me too! :) Mmm, what else? Ooo, there was Starbucks! the last Starbucks I was in, was in New York City back in April. Yuuup! Got the "Strawberry" Frap(Veinti size) w/whipped creme atop! Mmm, OH and there are some hot sales happening at Old Navy and Gap! I just got a HOT pair of boxers from the Gap though (arn't ya proud of me?!) Yeah, then I am going to a "Blue, Brews and Barbques" festival on the Willamette river in Portland. It should be a good time. Next Sunday, I'm going back heading back home (2 weeks earier than expected) but I'm not gonna tell anyone this news so I can suprise them. It will be six weeks that I was gone rather than eight weeks. Ehh, I miss some people there. This is a good chance to come back an improved person! I think I'll do that. Not judging everyone even if they'll find out or not and such... Yeah, that's the plan. (Not to mention, coming back a tanner man!)
