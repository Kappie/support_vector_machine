So my father wake me up this morning and say "School Time!". I decided to stay here and sleep. Is that life or not? I will be going to school tommorow anyway and see what is going on. I planned to come home with Wanderley and Mickaela anyway after.   As for the Blog stuff, http://www.blogger.com/ is incredible. Pretty everything is customizable, and easily(And thats not even the Html editor i am talking about!). Slowly i'll make more change. I added a visitors counter by Xiti.com. An 18 line code after, it works, unfortunately it will not go public until i see how exactly it works. The icon is there tought, it's an obligation for free users.   Not much plan today, i will call wanderley for my Activity Shirt, also i may Join Zyphern's Addiction Blog to help him a bit.  Any comments?  Regards,  Zephyr
