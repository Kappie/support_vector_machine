No time to come online to check on MNI. Mother brought back breakfast (duck porridge) and I meowed at it. Hmm. At 10.30, I came online. After that, I went away to watch HZGG and eat lunch (marcoroni). What another touching HZGG! Ayioh!! When is that stupid emperor coming to find them? SLOW!   Hmm. At 1,  was online lor. I went to play GunBound for awhile, then went off to surf the Net. Oh yes. I did my Pupil's Profile form. Ayioh!! The spaces were too little!! How am I supposed to write a lot! Haiyoh! Lousy! After writing the form, it was more internet surfing and chatting. Ayioh. So many cats to talk to!   Hmm. At 5, I went off to buy dinner for me and brother. It was Hokkien Prawn Mee again. Ayioh! I lost in the "4D People Counting" game!! Hokkien Prawn Mee is SLOW!      Hmm. I went back and ate while watching Unbeatables. Yao shu!! The mee is so spicy! I want to die le! After TV watching and dinner, I went to throw away the rubbish. Before I did, I took the strings attached to my pen and burnt them. The strings were from the Prelims and Os. Burning them sybolizes the end of one chapter of my life, and the start of the next. The plastic bag almost burnt. :P  After that, I went to bath, and tada, I am online. Right now, Wendy's at my house. Talking to me lor. That idiotic brother. I have to make him swear not to tell my parents. Ayier. I must also leave the door open ("gu nan kua nu" nonsense!).   Yay! I learnt how to tie a tie. HaHa. Finally! CQ told me tomorrow must bring PJ tie (the design is so horrendous!), so I must learn how to tie. Hmm. I went to a website and learnt lor. I did 4 different ties before settling down with the Half-Windsor Knot. O.O!! And AR!!! PE tomorrow! Eeee!   Okay. I gotta go now. See ya tomorrow. Night blog.
