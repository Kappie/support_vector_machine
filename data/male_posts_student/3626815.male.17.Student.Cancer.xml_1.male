Anyway, just wanted to say that a friend of mine (The previously mentioned Adam) played me a song by Five Iron Frenzy called "Pre-Ex Girlfriend" and I am now even more emotionally scarred for life. Here are the lyrics.  "Pre-Ex-Girlfriend"  She's so cool it's almost eerie she's so fine I lost all hope Genetical testing something has gone wrong she should get back in her cage before they find she's gone She said she hated Kenny G that girl is way too good for me We'll break up before it starts She'll only tear my world apart da na na na na na na na  [Chorus:] Pre-ex-girlfriend, that girl is just too fine Pre-ex-girlfriend, leaving me behind  You might say she's everything just before everything goes wrong She's sunshine and lightning she pulls at my heartstrings she's stunning and then she's gone The intellect that girl has She's saying "death to false jazz" Like kryptonite to Superman she's here to break my heart again da na na na na na na na  Watch her on the floor tonight feel the crush she will incite the spark of hope she will ignite a beautiful sight Softer than the lightest snows watch her as the moment slows in my face the door will close and there she goes.   [Spoken:] Guy: Uh-um Hi... Girl: Hi Guy: I uh, I was across the room and I looked over, and I saw you... and um... Girl: yea? Guy: I was wondering if... Girl: Uh-huh Guy: Maybe you wanted to... uh... go do something? Girl: Umm.. No.   You see what I mean? If you don't, you probably haven't read my first post. Hats off to you for opening up old wounds, Adam!
