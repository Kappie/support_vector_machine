Things are goin great - I'm starting to get into the swing of things for the D.C. trip, and I am starting to feel much freer now that I'm almost done with Lianda (just the audit tomorrrow!).  It's been great being there, but sometimes CHANGE IS GOOD!  Aside from this...I like the group for the D.C. trip, it could be a lot of fun AND quite an experience.  I've started another blog just for the trip, so if you want to read about it go  urlLink here .  I don't know how much more I'm going to be updating this blog once I'm in D.C. - I'll probably put the "personal" stuff here and the day-to-day happenings on there.  But we'll see...
