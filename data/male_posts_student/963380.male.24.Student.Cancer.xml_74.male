Apparently that's the time it takes for a police officer to determine that a dog is a lethal threat.  urlLink This has to be one of the most disturbing things I've ever seen in my life.  I was disturbed to hear about this story. I was even more disturbed to see the video. I simply can't imagine what was going on in the mind of the officer who shot this dog. The situation was grossly mishandled from the word go. Then again, if this had have been a carjacking and one of the officers hurt, there would have been hell to pay. Confusing, yet accurate, I think.  24 is simply amazing. I sit in shock and watch. You honestly don't notice an hour sliding away.
