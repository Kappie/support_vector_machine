The actors are awful - every line in the movie sounded utterly scripted, and not to mention that the content of their conversations is terrible. This is just a fuel for capitalist, egotistical mindsets of our corrupted youth. The "extreme" sports, the "dirty dancing," the pathetic conversations about "who's hot." This is exactly the kind of stuff that blows me away in public. People try to emulate this fake life and it is simply pathetic. We have the worst media in the world.  If I could tell you anything, I'd say - save yourself time and money and don't watch this pathetic excuse for a movie. Save yourself your dignity and your personality.
