Not been busy this week, losta alone time, can't keep going on about the same ol' thoughts forever I suppose. Let's see, just back from my lame driver's ed, I passed the written - barely... made some stupid answers. Things cooling down between me and michelle it seems, it's mutual though. Prolly for the best cause I had some pretty deep feelings... always end up hurt, angry, or depressed, sometimes all three. Then got tired of feeling that way, though I still care. It is depressing to think that michelle didn't feel the same way... sure, you said you cared for me, but not the same. Though it's nice we're still close.  I look forward to university, plently of new friends and parties around the corner. I also look forward to my upcoming grading at karate. Well... don't know exactly what to say... mostly I know the people reading this, and they would have heard what I wanted to say too them. Except I want to go clubbing with Mike when he comes back from basic... how the hell I will manage to be doing that considering I'm not 18 for another two months.
