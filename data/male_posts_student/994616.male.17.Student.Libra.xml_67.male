Everyone knows macs are expensive and that is what they used the new mac g5. Guess how much it cost them? 5 million dollars thats right a 20th of the cost of most supercomputers. The price of the fastest supercomputer? $350 million ie  70 times  the price payed by virginia tech, interesting huh?  I'm listening to  Special  from the album "Version 2.0" by Garbage for more info on them click  urlLink here . I'd give this song about 5 stars out of 5  poisoned shroom to  touch typing  1up shroom to guess!
