No thanks to some incosiderate asshole who was sitting there for half an hour doing god-knows-what while I had to wait outside the toilet jumping up and down and pace around whilst trying to control my bowels. Damn, I think some of the butter I ate was bad.  Anyways, since this is a post I made at the library in the morning, I gotta keep it short and sweet. I'm here for some research assignment that has been screwing me over. The words "geography" will eternally haunt me. It's the last day before I go back to school, the last day of freedom... it's a sobering and depressing thought. Ah well, it's only 11.00 am and I've finished all my work. Might as well twiddle my thumbs....  *twiddles thumbs*
