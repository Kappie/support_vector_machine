It was considered an occupational benefit and the reason he got the job in the first place.                      It was assumed that since a deaf bookkeeper would not be able to hear anything he'd never have to testify in court. When the Godfather goes to shake down the bookkeeper about his missing $10 million bucks, he brings along his attorney, who knows sign language.                     The Godfather asks the bookkeeper:            "Where is the 10 million bucks you embezzled from me?"                     The attorney, using sign language, asks the bookkeeper where the 10 million dollars is hidden.                      The bookkeeper signs back:             "I don't know what you're talking about."   The attorney tells the Godfather: "He says he doesn't know what you're talking about."   That's when the Godfather pulls out a 9 mm pistol, puts it to the bookkeeper's temple, cocks it, and says: "Ask him again!" The attorney signs to the underling: "He'll kill you for sure if you don't tell him!" The bookkeeper signs back: "OK! You win! The money is in a brown briefcase, buried behind the shed in my cousin Endo's backyard in Queens!" The Godfather asks the attorney: "Well, what's he say?"  The attorney replies: "He says you don't have the balls to pull the trigger."
