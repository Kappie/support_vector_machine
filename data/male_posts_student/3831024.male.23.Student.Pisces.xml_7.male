The deparment of pediatrics at the nmmc is terrible. they wouldnt care if the clerk died as long as they got their way with the labs, the procedures and the reporting. there are roaches in the ward. they come out at night and crawl out and about on the furniture, on the food and on the patients themselves. one of them managed to crawl up my leg while i was inserting an intravenous line. dextrose in laymans terms. i was pumping the heart of a little boy the other day. it gave up on him. i was his heart. and even i was losing hope. there is no light here. no hope. only pain. and death in the end. The other day we were having our endorsements. the newest resident was receiving a chewing out from the consultant. the resident was on the verge of tears and when she was asked to proceed with her report, the same consultant just whipped her head around to another consultant and chatted in full volume adding much insult to the ludicrous injury already given. worthy to mention is that same well respected consultant is taking up nursing to get out of this country. there are patients here, but there no medicines. there are medicines but there is no money. philippine health care goes not to the needy but to those who can afford. and that is made ever more evident in a run down roach infested government hospital like the NMMC. and i turn off the faucet as i was my plate with tears.
