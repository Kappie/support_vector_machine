Tragic news for menstrual-based merchandise lovers everywhere, this  urlLink link  brings news of Bodyform's decision to drop the '  Whoa Bodyform  !' song from its advertising! Sacrilege I tell you!  One point about the post though, it mentions that it has never been credited to any artist. I'm fairly sure that on a version of Channel 4's  100 Greatest Adverts  they interviewed the woman responsible for this musical gem!  Consider it my mission to find this woman!  Updates as and when I find the Voice of Bodyform!!
