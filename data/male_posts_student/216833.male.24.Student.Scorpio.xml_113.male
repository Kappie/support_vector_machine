It's my fault of course. I had a little more wine than I should have had and a little more spicy mac'n'cheese than I really should have eaten.   At 6am all three of my alarm clocks went off, it was that unrelenting reminder that my day has begun, and like most of the time, I am not quite finished with what I was doing. The instant the TV came on, Betty the cat walks over to me and starts talking to me. It's either "get up" or "turn that shit off." I can't tell exactly which, but she sounds pissed at me.   I really should be working, I have a long list of problems and tasks that I need to attend to today - not including my personal business of going through job listings and faxing/emailing resumes. James went to see the doc so I am stuck here to work on all this shit alone. It's is just a little more than normal.  Last night I went with eric to see: xfilesx - deadfood - think i care - and some other band from lawerence, ks(who tours in a short bus) It was nice to see people I hadn't seen in a while: james delgado, josh brown, and nick and darius. I personally didn't get into any of the music that night, it just wasn't my thing really. I thought it was sort of bland - but I'm just an ass hole.   I didn't go to school last night - I need to get on the ball with that and knock it out. That is probably the best thing I can do right now as far as working towards the new cali job. Tonight is my little sisters birthday, so I am going out to Ft. Worth around 4pm to hang out with them. Maybe I will take a nap.  peace   current mood:  tired current music: me yawning
