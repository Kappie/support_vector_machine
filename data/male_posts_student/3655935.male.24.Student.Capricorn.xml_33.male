While large doses of Dashboard can lead to depression and unhealthy obsessive thoughts about why she stopped calling me when I’ve done nothing wrong—I mean, did I say something wrong? Is she interested in someone else? Does she think I’m gay?... Sorry, I seem to have digressed.  The following song, “Again I Go Unnoticed,” has been especially helpful:  So quiet another wasted night, the television steals the conversation exhale, another wasted breath, again it goes unnoticed.   Please tell me you're just feeling tired cause if it's more than that I feel that I might break out of touch, out of time. Please send me anything but signals that are mixed cause I can't read your rolling eyes out of touch, are we out of time?   Close lipped another goodnight kiss is robbed of all it's passion, your grip another time, is slack it leaves me feeling empty.   I'll wait until tomorrow maybe you'll feel better then maybe we'll be better then so what's another day when I can't bear these nights of thoughts of going on without you this mood of yours is temporary it seems worth the wait to see your smile again out of the corner of your eye wont be the only way you'll look at me then.
