YAY!!! 1st block...I don't have my homework done...no one really notices or cares, encluding the teacher, which was O.K. FOCUS: I try to do as much manual labor as possible just to try and keep myself busy, because when I'm not busy, I'm thinking, and when I'm thinking, I get depressed...and I was trying to avoid Tina.  I go back into Mrs. Loney's room after doing as much work as possible, until it was done, and all of my friends are sitting outside the classroom talking to guess who...TINA!!!  They're sitting outside just chatting it up with her, having a gay old time, meanwhile I sit in the room ripping up old Japanese homework because I'm so fucking pissed at them.....Is it so bad to ask for a little loyalty???? seriously!! 2nd block: I got to Broadcast Communications and wrote another poem, which sounded a lot like a suicide note, I seriously talk about how everything pisses me off, and I feel like shit, and I just want to die, or go into a never-ending sleep.  Then I went to McDonalds and got sum Apple Pies because it wasn't time for Lunch yet, they were still serving breakfast and I couldn't get a damn Big Mac yet....stupid McD's....then on the way back, I smelt sumthing that smelled like a skunk, and I ask the driver and the passenger what the smell was, and they were sittin' there smokin' pot...ON THE WAY TO SKOOL!!! With me in the backseat, trying not to breath in any fumes or nuthin' 3rd Block: I was gonna express to sumone how much I hate things at the moment, then we got new seats... poo on you new seats.  So we sat in Japanese and talked about what we're gonna be doing for our reward day on Thursday, and everyone wanted to watch anime, when I just wanted to play Battleball, mainly because I just wanted to hit sumthin'....then we decided what toppings we wanted on our pizza for the anime, and nobody wanted sausage except me....talk about a downer...but then my awesome tomodachi*friend* told me that she would make 1/4 of the pizza sausage just for me :-) That made me happy, but that smile looks wicked to me for sum reason....it's kreepin' me out. 4thA Block: I paced around the Choir room for a while, until the bell rung, then I sat down and she told us how we had to write our Concert Reflection and I didn't, instead I wrote ANOTHER depressing poem, which was worse than the last one....and no one seemed to notice, until Cobian asked me what was wrong, and i said nuthing. 4thB Block: I sat there and wrote my actual Concert Reflection essay, and Erivn asked me what was wrong towards the end of class, and I basically told him to fuck off....I feel bad. Then I got on the bus and this weird kid who i don't know commented on how many sharpies I have...meanwhile I just sat in thought and listened to my CD player...if it weren't for my CD player I would go insane...seriosuly Then I got home, and that's where it all goes downhill fast, I got home and decided to tell all my friends to not talk to me or have any contact with me, mainly because of Tina, and how I am really starting to hate her pressence, even though I feel if she were to ask for forgiveness or sumthin'..I would give it to her in the wink of an eye....which makes me MORE pissed...mainly at myself....for being such a dumbshit, JUST GIVE UP MAN...SHE'S NOT COMING BACK!!!! GET OVER IT!!!!!  Man I'm a sad, pathetic loser. Then after I told all my friends to go to hell, I decided to study, because that keeps me from freely thinking, and so I sat and studied Japanese for a while...which I still don't quite don't understand...then I decided I didn't like studying, so I layed down and decided I wanted to sleep, so I did....restlessly.  I kept waking up like every half hour, and with my contacts in...so now my eyes look like shit....and when my dad got home he woke me up unintentionally, and we discovered that the heat was out in out house....YAY!! SO I'm freezing now too!! I still have to take a shower too, and it has to be hella-short, because we only have a little bit of hot water in our pipes...and the rext will be freezing cold.  So, I'm pretty pissed right about now, and I just read bash.org for like 2 hours....god that is uber-funny..... Skool is going to suck for the next little while, and I'm going to get very depressed and very sad, most likely crying a lot...and I don't wanna...but I have to, because if I don't....I'll never get over Tina, and that will just leave to MORE sadness....so.....I'm trying to beat pain with pain I guess, which sux hardcore.  Oh well, like anyone actually gives a damn about my senseless whining, not to mention that like two people read this ever.....if that....Peace!  Spense
