OK maybe not but they are undefeated..  Eat that Yankees...  Then Saturday I had to work which sucked hut then I came back and celebrated the win of the Jayhawks...   The craziness was awesome..  filled mass street.. and then to a keg party to say whats up to my old roomie...  didn't really get drunk but had a few beers and rejoiced..  It was a good night..  Now it's lots of work...  Paper and speech to write...  So i'm off...  but only 3 days till Yale...
