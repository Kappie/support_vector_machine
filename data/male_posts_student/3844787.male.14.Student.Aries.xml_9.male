Its just dumb! All i'm doing is either skating, playing guitar, sitting on the pc or playing on my xbox, I need too go outside, I feel restricted as if there is a barrier outside my door!  I only feel good when i'm doing skarz, i'm not sure why, its just the feeling that I get as the adrenaline pumps through my blood when I do something outrageous, it feels good, i'm not sure how too explain the feeling, its just like a rush, a 'natural high', its the feeling you get when you land a trick for the first time on a skateboard, or complete something you've been attempting too do for a while.   I got banned from the MSGPlus! Community forums a week ago, and they should have unbanned me by now, so now I sit and wait for them too unban me, it's like torture! Why can't they unban me! Its annoying, i'm not sure what they did, why can't they email me, explaining what i've done wrong, its as if they don't care that i'm supporting Patchou's work on his great extension.   I traded in my Gameboy Advance, Azurik: the rise of perathia and Minority report today, I exchanged them for Need for Speed: Underground, Colin McCrae Rally 3 and Legacy of Kain - Defiance. So for i have done quite a few races on need for speed and have a nice looking Honda Civic, i'm just waiting too trade for a Nissan Skyline (my dream car)!!! On Legacy of Kain i'm stuck on a part where i have to race too the top of the room before some mist rises and engulfs me, i can't seem to get up high enough and keep falling. On colin mccrae, i just can't seem too get the controls right! I'll figure it out one day!  I now know the official release date for Halo 2, and its not changing, it was told at E3! Ladies and Gentleman, the game of the decade will be out on November the 9th! I know this because i brought the official xbox magazine, and on the 12 minute video of Halo 2, the man had it tattood on his arm!!! It was crazy!!  I'm getting more publicity off the net now, so i'm getting happier and happier, Messenger Milk is going well for JWB and he's doing really well, who knows, he might be the new patchou!
