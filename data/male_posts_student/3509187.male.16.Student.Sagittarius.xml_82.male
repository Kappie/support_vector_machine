Well, Other than rain, Wilderness was fun...  And you know what... GIG tomorrow... WHEEE that'll be a rush...  ummm yeah so a week away brainwashed me in a way so I don't really know what to say so...   Hey Mike Tyson/ Amy... Oregon you say... thats pretty far from humble (and rainy) PA... I'm doing pretty well... how about you?  I just read you latest post (sorry too lazy to read more then that...) but its crazy cause you remind me a of a friend, lynn, and you mention Kelsey and McKenzie... I know people with those names and they are not common sames... well ok I guess this is getting to be as rambling (and worse) than your last post... which in my eyes went a perfectly clear path... then again look at my posts... My Brain definately does in circles and then finds a random tangent to follow.... Tangent Universe... Donnie Darko... WHEEEEEEEEEEEEE...well there you go... yeah so WHo's Line is it Anyways? we did a who's line skit at camp and i was drew cary... I'd have to say i did a pretty great job of it... making up the stuff and i'd also have to say my crew was awesome at improving... yes we did it the right way, no cheating...  well ok Amy if I havn't freaked you out... comment back...  later then...  -Dan V
