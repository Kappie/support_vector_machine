Waiting for this for months, I downloaded the Visual C# Express and Visual Web Developer Express and use it. Wow!!! It's incredible. Although they're slow and a little bit unstable, I can try the new features which is very interesting. The Login System in ASP.NET 2.0 making me can add membership feature without writing any code! Now I can make a good-looking web site in no time!  The graduation dinner has ended. Out of my expectation, the graduation dinner is quite boring. The food is just normal, the programmes is a little bit boring. So I just talk to John the whole night... By the way, everybody dressed beautifully that night. At that time I realized we are becoming adults, not children any more.  July will be a boring month. But I think I'll try my best to learn typing as soon as possible. Also, I will study complex number and conics by myself. Don't call me crazy guy~
