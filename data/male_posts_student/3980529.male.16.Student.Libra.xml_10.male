Face it, when you got a guy who tattoo's his arm with a date just to prove to people it will come out that day, I don't think it would go any other way. November 9th ladies and gentlemen... if the game though SOMEHOW comes out August 24th, then that'll be the biggest damn shocker ever. Of course, I would also be proven wrong in my opinion that this August 24th rumor was all a lie. We're all waiting for Halo 2 yes, but i've been waiting for other games too. Some of them like Fable, Kingdom Hearts 2, Devil May Cry 3, and who could forget, the new Legend of Zelda game. So many great games coming out this year and next, but one thing that bugs me is that the PS3, Xbox 2, and GC2 are coming out ALREADY. 2005 or 2006, yeah, I mean 4 years apart? How long did it take me to save up for my systems? Yeah, a LONG time. I'm 16 and I don't have a full-time job where I can just get paid a thousand bucks a month, so yeah, I hope i'll be able to afford at least one of these systems. To conclude this, i'll be making my "Top Games List" in a few minutes and make a link to that.
