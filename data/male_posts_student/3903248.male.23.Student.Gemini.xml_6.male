It's like the damn things just prance around all over the place and then at exactly 12:01am on October 1st they decide to become elusive.  I had a shot at one deer last season, and the cap on my muzzleloader didn't blow.  The hunting Gods hate me.  Anyways, I decided since I can't shoot one right now, might as well get a few pictures, since, as we all know, I have a serious addiction to my new camera.  So Angela and I are sitting on the back porch for maybe 10 minutes when a doe and a fawn walk up over the hill.  I start snapping pictures like crazy until Angela scares them off.  Lucky for her, she has other good qualities to balance her lack of driving ability and a seemingly endless talent for disturbing anything I am trying to focus on.  Once the doe and fawn shag ass back into the woods there is another doe and fawn working their way over the hill.  I take some more pictures, look to my left, and see a small buck coming across the field.  He wasn't very big, but his antlers were still in velvet, so it looked kind of cool.  In total I took a little over 150 pictures of them.  Out of those 150, there are only about 10 that I like.  Damn my perfectionist streak.  Regardless, I posted my favorite shots for all to see.
