I've taken up a new summer endeaver. I'm gonna be a household slave for the ENTIRE summer :). It's like this: My mom wants me to do something during the summer, like something meaningful. Her list of choises were: Get a job, take swimming lessons, go to China, volunteer at library, volunteer at old-folk's home, and doing all household chores for the summer. Since I'm sociophobic, I can only choose to stay home and be a slave. Btw, all household chores mean EVERYTHING, from cooking dinner to cleaning the washrooms... And believe me, it's not easy... Chinese food is crazy... The simplest ones take an hour; U'll c me running across the kitchen, battering the eggs, picking the beans, cutting the melon-like thingies, frying the leafy vegetables, boiling the soup... eek, just thinking about it haunts me.  But being a slave gives me some power as well... Being able to prepare food means I'll be in the position to sneak in some poison. And being able to clean means I'll be in the position to install hidden cameras... The slave will be the master.  Grins evilly .  Anyways, I just saw AFI's 100 years, 100 songs. It's this list of 100 songs from 100 years of american film, voted in by a bunch of important filmography people... Guess what the number one song was...  Somewhere over the rainbow Way up high, There's a land that I heard of Once in a lullaby.  Somewhere over the rainbow Skies are blue, And the dreams that you dare to dream Really do come true.  Someday I'll wish upon a star And wake up where the clouds are far Behind me. Where troubles melt like lemon drops Away above the chimney tops That's where you'll find me.  Somewhere over the rainbow Bluebirds fly. Birds fly over the rainbow. Why then, oh why can't I?  If happy little bluebirds fly Beyond the rainbow Why, oh why can't I?  I doubt many of us would recognize that. After all, it was in 1939's  Wizard of Oz , "Somewhere Over the Rainbow".  I spent 3 hours watching the show... Listening and watching songs and scenes from almost 100 movies... It's inspired me to want to visit/revisit some of these classics. Right now, I have a tramendous urge to go download the Sound of Music and Westside Story. Maybe I will... hmm...
