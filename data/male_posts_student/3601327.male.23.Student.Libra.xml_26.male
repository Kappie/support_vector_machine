When you click the "Sign In" button you will be taken to the "dashboard" - in the dashboard you will see a listing of current blogs, one of which should be "Hell's Kitchen", that's our blog.  Click on the hyperlink to Hell's Kitchen, from there you'll be able to post to the site. Use the "Posting" tab, then "Create" and you'll be up and running.   I have myslelf listed as the only administrator so I'm the only one right now that can make changes to the template and change the settings, but all the rest of you should be able to post original threads.  If you have any problems, send me a PM on the mothership.
