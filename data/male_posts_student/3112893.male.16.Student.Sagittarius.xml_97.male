This is a little depressing. It seems that no one is posting guesses for songs 'cept Missy here who didn't know the artist, but was nice enough to at least post a comment. Let's all give Missy a round of applause and check out her blog. Anyway, don't think that just because you don't guess, it'll make me stop doing these. It wont, and in fact will make me want to do it more, so just guess even if you know you're wrong or think that your guess will be stupid.  The code is my left and right hands are shifted right a key so that my left hand has it's fingers on sdfg and my right hand has 'em on kl;'.  Here are the answer Guess The Song I: Noh Fo[[rt nu Niol;y Yp D[o;; gtp, Yjrtr Od Moyjomh Etpnh Eoyj :pbr  Here are the answer Guess The Song II: D;rr[es;lomh nu ,pfrdy ,pidr gtp, Niolf Dp,ryjomh Piy Pg Mpyjomh  He he. Have fun with those. I've triple-checked them for accuracy.  That is all. -- Feanor
