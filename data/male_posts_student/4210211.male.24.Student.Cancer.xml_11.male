I had farted.  I had farted, and the sound combined with the vibration had shaken me awake.  I HAD FALLEN ASLEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF GRAND ROUNDS AND FARTED MYSELF AWAKE IN FRONT OF THE ENTIRE CARDIOLOGY DEPARTMENT.  Now let us never speak of this again."  ha!  oh that michelle...what will she do next??
