It seems like a lot of people are saying they "saw," or "know," me or something about me... that I didn't know that they did. It's somewhat unnerving...  Now playing: Tom Jones - "She's a Lady"  On the other hand, I saw a lot of people around today and did a bit of chatting with most.  I haven't gotten much work done the past few days.  So it's a funny thing, every couple of weeks or so... I go into MS Outlook and schedule myself to get my ass up early to work out and / or do work... but it never happens. I'm getting in the mood to do that again, but I'm holding back so I don't feel like failure when it doesn't happen.  Now playing: Operation Ivy - "Take Warning"  Hmm Op Ivy... when Tim Armstrong was cool. Oh how do things change!  Lately I've also been thinking about doing things like getting a bike... maybe after I find out where I'll be living next year.  ***
