Shame that has all ended now... Though, the down side was... i reversed my beautiful 206 into a really really high curb scratching the rear bumper quite a bit... IT goes great with the already scratched side pannels, and a dent that car gave me in a car park, probably some mother at shcool.. picking up their son... and reversed into my car.. and just left it there. ARSEHOLe.. thats what i say... but hey... my car is already scratched.. and if anything.. i can always blaim my brother....  But... this accident as such.. doens;t spoil my day... because i got to spend half of it with the most beautiful girl i've ever seem. and hopefully... we could get back together
