Went to the bank to get a bank draft of 43pounds to pay RELC the application fee.. Strange how SIM works, u pay them the course fees, but the application form to University of London need to be submitted to RELC.. Hmmz.. Oh well..  Went down to SIM first and asked about exemptions, went to the cashier to pay my fees, and the lady at the counter is a newbie! She seemed not too sure where to click and stuffs! And the worst thing is, her colleague teaching her half-hearted.. OMG, and i was tinking, my future is with ur mouse clicks DAMN IT! Asked the customer service people there and i discovered that my degree course does not have auto exemption for SP diplomas. Damn! But i tried applying for exemption, hope UOL will accept it...   And the lady asked me: "Do you know, you have to get the transcript in a sealed envelope to be submitted together with the form to RELC?"  And i said: "I thought i just bring the photocopies and let RELC verify?"  She said:"No thats for other courses, your course needs u to do so."  I was like "SHIT!", i need to get all these done, coz weekdays i will be working, i wont have time.. So i rushed down to SP's examinations office and the lady's attitude is damn fucked-up, giving me half-hearted help and answers.. And i only can get my transcript within 4 days, and by the time 4days is up, my application deadline is over! So i asked the lady whether she can just help me chop and seal the transcript i already have, and yes! My sealed and "untouched" transcript came out! Haha   Rushed down to RELC after that, and while waiting for the lift, theres a crowd coming, all submitting application forms.. This girl never filled her form properly and she missed out the part where we had to write an "essay" on why are u applying for this course.. The girl said: "Never mind, later i just write rubbish on it" and i was like WTF, i typed the essay on Word, went through spelling and grammer checks to make sure its perfect, and she said she's gonna write rubbish.. I dont really get it but oh well..   Called my friend, ben and told him about the sealed transcript part, and he told me he already laminated his transcript! What the hell.. That means he has to go down SP, and apply for the damn transcript, and hope he can get it done in time.. By the time he reached SP, the counter is closed, DAMN IT man.. Hope SIM can extend the deadline for him, haiz.. Troublesome shit, reminds me of the time when i was applying for poly..   Went straight home after all the shit, rushing here rushing there made me tired.. Took a nap and watched Joe Millionaire on chn5, its the final episode and the guy told the lady he chose, about the truth, and the lady didnt appear for the final part.. Oh.. another materialistic girl.. The poor guy went back to texas heart-broken but ended up, the lady came back! Oh, i was wrong about her.. True love, OHHHH haha...   And the winner is....   LOVE!!! LOL  No suzanne jung again, its a sunday, sad case, oh well looking forward to monday, but then again, need to work, HAIZ! Nothing is perfect...
