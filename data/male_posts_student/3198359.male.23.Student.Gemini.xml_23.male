In the first place, "redneck" is a racist, classist, and inflammatory term. You're every bit as fascistic as you claim True Christians are. And how DARE you make fun of the Holy Bible! Most editions have over 1,200 pages - and very little of it was written by sheep herders. Moses was reared as an Egyptian prince, Joshua was a military general, David and Solomon were kings, Isaiah and Jeremiah were prophets, and Luke was a healer. One day you'll wish you'd taken the time to get to know the Lord and His Holy Book a bit better. Unfortunately for you, you'll be stewing in a crater of bubbling lava in the darkest depths of homo hell by then. I urge you in the Name of Christ Jesus to repent now and put your evil ways behind you forever. Pray that God will take the bitterness and scorn out of your filthy black heart and make you clean. Only then can you know the Truth - never before.  Sister Lurlean Tucker Who used to pray for you!"  This poor delusioned little lady now would like to rant and rave over her nice little book. The problem is, I don't actually care and most of the world doesn't care either. Maybe if she went to a private shool, that fire and individuality would have been crushed out of her with in the first few years.
