Me and Skelley had the misfortune of working the tic-tac-toe booth, though I can't say it was totally terrible. Not too many kids came to our stand, which is a good thing because I probably would have ripped on of their heads off. And my bad mood was due to the unacceptable fact that THERE WERE NO POTATO CAKES. That's what I was looking forward to-eating potato pancakes and maybe some waffles and ice cream. But as soon as I get a break from the tic-tac-toe stand, they're all sold out. Sold out of potato cakes? Unheard of. So yeah the bazaar pretty much blew this year. Actually, the entire weekend pretty much sucked. I've not really been myself these past couple of days due to something I don't feel like going into detail right now. Alright, I lost the interest to keep writing so this post is done.  Listen to H.I.M.
