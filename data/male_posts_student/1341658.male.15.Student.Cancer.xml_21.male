Perhaps he could enlighten those of us benighted souls who are unable to find any utterances by Jesus in the Bible in which he instructs his followers accumulating vast wealth at the expense of others and bragging about their religious piety.  I guess my bible omitted the part that says, "Blessed are those who arm monstrous tyrants and then launch preemptive wars against them in my name for they shall be rich and have siblings who rig elections."  The administration must be using the version of the Bible that contains the verse,"And it shall come to pass that all things wrong shall be the fault of Bill Clinton because he did have sex with that woman."  And then there's the verse I can't find that reads,"And it shall be the policy of my chosen - though un-elected - one that national security will be breached by revealing the names of spouses in the CIA whose husbands dare to criticize him."  --Gary Gletty (opinion section of the Patagraph)   Lets not elect Bush in 2004  either .
