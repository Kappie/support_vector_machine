The world is not as carefree as it was yesterday -- my brain is infected with the strange compulsion to do something... there are too many people out there being nervous about stuff, and it woke me up.  I have a hypothesis.  People, or at the very least Americans who "know how to make an entrance" are born on Sundays.  Why?  Because Sundays know how to make an entrance.  Sundays always enter the week with a finality that cannot be found in other days... Tuesdays are Tuesdays, Thursdays are Thursdays, but Sundays...  Sundays are Sundays .  People do things on Sundays, and I think the things they do affect the collective unconscious in ways we do not immediately understand.  There are billions of people in church right now... and there are billions of people resenting those people who are going to church... and then there are people who resent both of them.  Sundays are absolutely loaded with those weird human emotions: devotion, faith, resentment, doubt, guilt -- people refusing to shop because its Sunday, people shopping on Sunday even though they feel bad about it, people sick of people not shopping on Sundays, people sick of people feeling bad about people feeling bad for shopping on Sundays, people fixing their homes, people watching sports, people cooking outdoors... it's a weird day.  It's like a day off that doesn't count -- although we are allowed to do nothing on Sundays, it's fairly understood in this country that even if you're doing nothing, your nothing ought to be something.  If you're reading, you should spend at least an hour reading a classic, or a work of socially relevant non-fiction.  If you're watching television, at least an hour should be spent watching quality programming, like PBS or the History Channel.  If you're cooking, it had better be a good meal.  It's not a real day off!  There are too many social responsibilities that infest the collective unconscious!  We need a new day off, a real day off... a day that doesn't mean anything.  I have not done ample research to back up my claim, but I have already chosen that new day:   Tuesday.   Yeah yeah yeah, I know what you're thinking.   Tuesday?!   Yeah, Tuesday, and I'll tell you why: first of all, the days YOU are thinking of, which are either Monday or Friday, will not work.  Although the three-day weekend is a nice thought, both of those days have ingrained significance in our lives... Fridays signal the end of the week, and the beginning of a deserved respite from the daily grind, and Mondays represent a return to it.  They are loaded with hope and a fateful determinism, respectfully.  Secondly, Tuesday as an enforced day off will not upset any sweeping preconceptions about the significance of days.  Tuesday is a bland day with no real social impact -- but if turned into the NEW day off, it would change the entire dynamic of the week... I'll explain how.  First, the weekend would still be relaxing, and people could still behave in their weird, sci-fi-esque manner on Sundays.  Mondays would still be bad, because everybody would be going back to work, like normal... but they wouldn't be  as bad  because everybody would know that they have the next day off.  Furthermore, after an entirely relaxing Tuesday that can be acceptably expended in any manner, the "real" work week would begin on Wednesday.  Wednesday is already known as the middle of the week --   and how bad can a work week be if it starts in the middle of the week?    Thursday remains the day before Friday (like being George Clooney's brother, or something... Some guy: "Hey, you're Thursday!  You come right before Friday, don't you?" Thursday:   "You know man, I am my own day, you know.") and Friday remains Friday.  The weekend remains the weekend.  Do you see how simple that makes everything?  The week is given an entirely new dynamic, one typified by its faithfulness to positivity both in its emphasis on relaxation, and in its subversion of the typically negative days.  Plus, we could tell our grandchildren about the "old days" when people worked on Tuesdays... that's why in "Stormy Monday" the guy says "Tuesdays are just as bad [as Mondays]."  That song would take on a whole new social relevance, and I think we need a new song like that.  But even moreso, we need a new day off... Tuesday could transform our culture in one fell swoop, making us a more patient, tolerant, and loving community.    Tuesdays should become the new day off not only for our benefit -- but for the benefit of the entire world.  Perhaps I embellish the significance of a different Tuesday... but I doubt it.  I think it may be the answer we've been looking for.  Regardless, today is Sunday and The Black Blossom has some tasks to perform -- I shall continue my discourse on a less busy day...    I think we all know what day I'm talking about...   know what I mean?    You know the day I'm talking about?    Tuesday.
