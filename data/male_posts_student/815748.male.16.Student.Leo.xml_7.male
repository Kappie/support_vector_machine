Because I understand AL of the concepts taught in math (even though it's honors), and my history teacher knows nothing about history, compared to me, at least.  2) I'm going to get a pocket constitution tomorrow. I lost the one I got last year, and I want to be able to effectively argue with my teachers about my rights.  3) I fasted for Yom Kippur (or Yom Ki-per, as some pronounce it), and I did one of the haftarah ALiyot, of which I am proud.  4) For some reason, while Loren and I were wALking to lunch one day, an upperclassman picked him up and temporarily carried him off. Afterward, I said a trio of hilarious comments about the situation, including "In the future, try not to get carried away," "You sure got swept off your feet," and "I've been picked up before, but never like that." One word. Well, three kind of. LOL!
