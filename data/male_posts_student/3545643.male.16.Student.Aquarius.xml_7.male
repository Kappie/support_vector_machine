Why do those dick weeds get everything the girls while I’m stuck here with my hand (bad joke). You know in the last month I’ve been told by almost four chicks "men you’re a nice guy Jake, I hope we can be friends." Friends?! Aren’t we already friends?! I mean really come on. If I wanted to be just friend I would have said so… you’re stuck in this Awkward friendship, because you look at the girl and think "man how can I get out of this, I can’t have her"…   Now I must say that my life doesn’t revolve around girls. I enjoy listening to music and hanging out in my friend basement. Another friends who applies to the problem above. Starting to see my point? O well, she’s a great friend. FRIEND to say the most. Ah man life’s a bitch, and then come exams. I think the teachers just like to see us in pain, sweating away trying to write the damn things.  Any ways I really don’t know why I have to be a nice guy…  Nice Guys Finish last (Green Day)  Nice guys finish last You're running out of gas Your sympathy will get you left behind Sometimes you're at your best When you feel the worst  Do you feel washed up like piss going down the drain Pressure cooker pick my brain and tell me I'm insane I'm so fucking happy I could cry Every joke can have it's truth but now the joke's on you I never knew you're such a funny guy  Oh nice guys finish last When you are the outcast Don't pat yourself on the back You might break your spine Living on command  You're shaking lots of hands You're kissing up and bleeding all your trust Taking what you need Bite the hand that feeds You lose your memory and you got no shame  Pressure cooker pick my brain and tell me I'm insane I'm so fucking happy I could cry Every joke can have it's truth but now the joke's on you I never knew you're such a funny guy  Oh nice guys finish last When you are the outcast Don't pat yourself on the back You might break your spine  Oh nice guys finish last When you are the outcast Don't pat yourself on the back You might break your spine  mmmmm Oh nice guys finish last When you are the outcast Don't pat yourself on the back You might break your spine  Oh nice guys finish last When you are the outcast Don't pat yourself on the back You might break your spine...
