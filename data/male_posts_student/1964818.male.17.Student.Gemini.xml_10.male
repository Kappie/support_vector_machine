I've beaten the main story, but there is still so much for me to do, and a lot I'm thinking I will never be able to do, because there are some objectives that are just too hard and I simply don't have good enough skills.  But still, no matter what, I love this game and I want to try it all.  Now that I have beaten it though, I know exactly what's going to happen in the movie, but it doesn't really matter though, since none of it surprised me.  Now I know all the things that happen are what I wanted, I'm glad that it will turn out the way it does.  Now I still have two weeks to wait until I can get Tales of Symphonia, since I will be in LA the day it comes out and wont be back until the end of the week.  I want that so bad, I can't wait to gee it...  later...
