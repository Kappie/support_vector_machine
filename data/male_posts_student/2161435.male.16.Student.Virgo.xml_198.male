Though, judging by the bottles on the floor, I must have drank a fair bit. The worst bit for me was when I got into bed though. That's when the vodka kicks in and I start rolling around all dizzy. Then about an hour after I threw myself towards the toilet to chuck it all out again.  Lush.  Damn vodka..  Rob sent me interesting texts. "Ok. In away now in tryna sleep", "Im ducked. You shoulda got pissed.", "I finl in ripped ignore o."  I think he was pissed.
