I'm not gonna lie to myself, I really wish things were different in a lot of regards to a certain someone. I most defineately liked her more than anyone else I've met since high school. That's not me talking in the here and now, but there's something about her that makes it feel like she embodies so much of things I admire and like. I'm not wallowing in self-pity, actually when I think about certain things about her it still brings a smile to my face.   Hopefully a couple of days out of town within the next week will recharge me and get me looking forward rather than looking backward.  Now playing: Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start the Fire."  ***
