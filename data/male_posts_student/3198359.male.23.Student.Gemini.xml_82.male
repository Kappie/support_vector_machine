Lets put it this way, Cuba will become a free and democratic country before SUN stops stuffing around and finally walks the talk.    Mind you, funny news, some MOSAF spies were found to have been trying to purchase a New Zealand passport; 6 months in the slammer and Israel completely washing their hands of the situation.    Oh, from what I've heard, the senate has passed the freetrade agreement with the United States; before you yanks get all excited, the amount of access to the US market is so pittifully pathetic, it clearly sits in the US favour, but then again, we're talking about little Johnny Howard and the Liberal party; the official "conga line of suck holes" to the US.    Anyway, looking forward to that laptop arriving on Monday/Tuesday next week, and getting back to study the week after; hopefully everything will go alright and there will be a job available when I get back to New Zealand.
