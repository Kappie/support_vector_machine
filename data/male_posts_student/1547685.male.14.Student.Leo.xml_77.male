I ended up sleeping on top of Kennys bunk so that was great that he got in my cabin. So we ate dinner and went to chapel to hear our first message. THe first message was on astronomy and the GLORY OF GOD but basically the whole week was on CREATION vs. evolution. The next day i woke up early, ate breakfast, took the workshop "I Think theres pgs missing in my BIBLE", and then went to chapel for a message on the origin of Life. For rec we had the tarp game which was a huge tarp with soap on it and the object was to try to restle ppl and get some balls worth points for our team. Lets see i think i spent time with my cuz, praise, sarah, and kenny after that but i forgot what happened after that. At night we saw the movie "The Ride" which was a really good message but the acting was sooooooooooooo corny. So blah blah blah happened until we get to Wednesday where i took the class again and then played cards for like 2 hours with praise and sarah. Thursday i took the classs "The Supremecy of Loving God" which was taught by one of my favorites, pastor steve louie. That was really fun schtuff and i think for rec that day we played a GIANT game of dodgeball..hmm or was that the day before? O well i cant remember.....so i finished off that day and then took the class on Friday and met up with Pastor Sen, the "GOD FATHER" of CBM ministry. Walked around with him and looked at the new cabins... o yeah we also got a chance to "chit chat". After we went to corporate worship and the message was on Dinos and facts about evolution/creation. And i know that on this day we played "Protect the President" where we had to huddle around a concelor and protect them from getting wet while ppl throw water balloons at us. O boy that was really fun.... So that was my final day of CBM camp for 2004 and it was a blast.  Interesting things i did at camp: 1. Played Hard Core Ping Pong 2. Picked up a full grown man for a pic. (Steve the Director, age-35) 3. Actually challenged a concelor at dueces and lost 4. Saw Kenny's concelor jump into kennys bed and get cuddled by him 5. Washed someones feet for devos 6. Played 15 games of foosball and never lost 7. Met some really NICE NEW councelors 8. Spent some good kinda quality time with friends 9. Learned A lot about GOD! 10. Sang WHo AM I as a praise song when its not actually suppose to be one 11. Got slapped on the butt by someone who wasnt my councelor 12. Was liked more by kennys councelor then kenny 13. Heard someone in my cabin fong pei like over a 1000 times while at camp 14. Saw praise drool over someone (im not telling who it is!)  PS. Ill put pics in once i develop my pics
