She was to "prideful", and she decided to be dumb instead. She calls the cops and lies. Yeah, that was so fun. So, now i'm moving out. She lied to the cops, and told them that I hit her. Thankfully the cops believed me and not her. I am moving out today, and moving in with my Aunt for the summer. Hopefully, I can figure something out before school starts again. I really don't want to switch schools again. Well, comment on whether you think that this whole thing was stupid or not. ciao.
