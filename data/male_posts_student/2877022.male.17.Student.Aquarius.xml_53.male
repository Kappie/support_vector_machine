Call me sensitive, call me naive,  But call others insensitive, call others ignorant.   I once asked someone,  their purpose, their meaning in life.  Christians themselves sometimes do not know,  At other times I question my own.   Refering to both SJ's and Amanda's posts,  life is indeed too short for one's liking,  to be squandered on books, wasted on grades.   It makes us empty inside,  putting on false smiles, false laughs.  People around us do not realise, do not understand,  but what hurts the most is that we ourselves don't either.   Break free of your bonds,  ask your heart what it wants in life.  tell your heart to be happy.   I hope one day that everyone will be able to answer that question.  Truthfully, honestly,  butmost importantlyhappily and proud.   For the Christians: In the Lord we trust and hope until his glorious second coming. Amen.   Written by: Janet the Weary
