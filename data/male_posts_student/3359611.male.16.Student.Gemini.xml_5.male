About how she would love the restaurant, and how nice her garden is looking. Completely ignoring the fact that as we spoke, about 150 miles away, she was in a hospice, slowly dying of cancer. Carefully skirting round the subject, tiptoeing round any mention of how she actually was, of the fact she had days to live.

Well, shes dead now, and the funeral has taken place, and it was awful, and derpessing, but its done with, and I'll never forget her. However, it still gets to me. The way soceity's taboos and opinions stop any discussion of serious issues, things that need to be talked about, in any other situation apart form the extremes of emotions. We were sat there, casually disscussing my grannie's fuschia bushes, all of us knowing she'd be dead in days, and that it really didn't matter, and all of us with these feelings we needed to talk about, but couldn't, so we focussed on the parts of her life which weren't to hot to touch. 

Ah well. Rest in Peace, Jean and Richard Pendle
