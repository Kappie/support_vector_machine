It's my personal opinion that I like good surprises, like winning the Publisher's Clearing House Sweepstakes, and getting pornographic pop-ups is not one of those good surprises. Anyway, it's even worse when it appears on your screen when in your school's library. Did you know you can get charged with sexual harrassment if a boob ends up on your screen? Not cool. So take it from me, kids: when you're bored, don't start typing random words in the browser to see if they're actual sites. Especially if the site takes you to "blood.com". And by the way, "flickingboogers.com", disappointingly, does not exist.
