On the news some kid from my school was booted out cuz he had a hit list with like 10 dudes and some teachers, and shit about how he was gonna kill them and then kill himself, fuckin Columbine wannabes, shit, what the fucks wrong with people. Then i started thinkin', was I on that list? Nahh, prolly not, dude was 17, makin him a junior, or a pretty stupid sopohomore, so i was most likely NOT on the list, they didnt say who that kid was though, and I wanted to find out when I went to school today, but im sittin at home cuz my fucking ride is 2 stupid to give me a call to see if im on time, they stupid fucker always leaves late to begin with, an extra minute isnt going to fuck up his schedule, god damn, he forgot me yesterday 2.  I also watched that vid of the dude gettin his head cut off, on the time stamps 11 hours lapse over the whole thing, one time lapse was inbetween when they assaulted him, and cut his head off, so i was wonderin what the hell kinda fucked up shit they were doin do that dude in god knows how much time, i'm going to just assume anally raped. I also noticed dead peoples faces look really weird, really creepy, but before i get TOO sadistic lets move on.  My mom gave me an extra 10 bucks this morning, i dont know why, but she did, so thaz cool, maybe ill go buy a CD or something with my other money OR!!! ill put it in my fund to get my Klipsch 5.1 Ultra speaker system for my comp, after i get that i wanna get another 2 extra subs i can link up 2 it, so it will have the dual side firing subs, and then 2 extra 8 inch subs, 100 watts a piece, my current 6-inch sub is enuf to make parts of the house rattle, so i figure with my next set up ill be shakin shit off the walls.    Sometimes i just wanna grab somebody by their hair and start punching the crap out of their face, i figure before they can fight back ill have 6 good hits to their nose. at that point they might be in a state of shock allowing me to smash em the eyes 2. Dont ask.  I started a new book, its BAD ASS, yeah thats right, books can be cool 2 you mudda puckers. It's The Face by Dean Koontz. I haven't gotten very far, but its about this ex LAPD cop workin for the biggest dude in hollywood as a security manager or something, and some dude has been like sending in 'disturbing' packages, and the dude is all tryin to solve the puzzle. Except so far its been being solved really fast and theres like 350 pages left so i figure the plot will thicken.  Indeed it shall.  Who said that?  I'm listening to Atmosphere, i've been listening to that a lot lately, Slug is a bad ass rapper and he generally has pretty good beats layed on his trax. oh yeh that reminds me I burned a copy of Aesop Rock - Labor Days for my russian teacher Mr. Plichta, he asked me 2 so i figured why not, I doubt he will like it though, oh well, doesnt hurt anything.  Also in russian we were discussing about how people need to be able to share their opinions freely, cuz fuckin Kim got pissed at mr. mac for saying there was no god and only science so she and her uppity bitch friends met for discussion after school, fuckin bitches like that get me pissed, who gives a flying fuck what somebody said, especially in science class, by a FUCKING SCIENCE TEACHER, what the hell do you think hez going to say? get real you stupid fuckers, i swear to god, people are so ignorant, its like they are appauled that somebodys opinion conflicts their one so throw a fit.  Who lit the fuse on your fuckin tampon?  good god people, seriosuly, lighten up  now if he was inforcing his beliefs and saying that his way was right, thats a whole nother story, but thats not what happened, atleast to my knowlege.  Oh yeah i was watching a news video about the raising gas prices and it informed me well. there is no shortage of gas, the prices ballooned cuz the demand on wholesale is so high they cant keep up with production so they jack their prices causing the other prices to soar also. And compared to inflation, this what our grandparents payed in the 1950s. (think ratios you stupid fuckers)
