Hi Brian.) need  an update:  BOOKS IN QUEUE: All Tomorrow's Parties The new So-Thick-You-Could-Easily-Kill-A-Fat-Man-With-It Harry Potter book RIFTS Player Handbook. It's pretty fuckin big too.  MUSIC LUSTED AFTER: Led Zeppelin Yes Traffic Los Lobos The Sea And Cake The soundtrack to Requiem For A Dream. Where the hell is that? Any new things I can sink my teeth into  GAMES BEING PLAYED: Far too much Imperian Far too little D Far more than my lifespan's alotted Vice City Just the right amount of Yahtzee (None at all, thank you kindly)  UH...RANDOM SHIT?: I think it's really badass that this nickname has actually caught on. Being casually referred to as Squirrel makes me smile inside, like God is patting me on the shoulder. Or something to the effect. If the Hulk was a chain-smoker, would the surgeons be able to cut into him in order to give him a lung transplant? I mean, if he was angry about the whole affair?  So now you know.  -Squirrel
