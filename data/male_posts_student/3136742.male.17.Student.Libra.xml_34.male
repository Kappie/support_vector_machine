You have to be the victim of the same  passion ! -Nietzsche  Lately I feel like I've lost the point to my existence. (Hold tight. This isn't what you think). I used to know my place. I was the angry, bitter cynic. I hated everything and always had a reason. I could analyze the shit out of anything and tell you exactly why it sucked; and I was right every time. But then, recently, something happened... I grew up. I had grown completely disgusted with my past behavior--my past mindset. But now I've changed, and while it sounds all for the better it's really not. Being the angry guy, I was always one last straw away from flipping my lid and going on a tirade. It was hard being that guy, but at least I knew my place-- at least I knew my friends from my enemies. People either agreed with me and loved me or they disagreed with me and went about their own thing. I was happy with that. There has since been a complete 180ยบ shift in my personality. I really feel like I appreciate everything now. There is hardly a song, movie, book, TV show, radio station, or even a person that I don't like. Where I used to see only the bad in everything, I now see all the good and now I realize that the bad doesn't matter. Why is it worse like this? It's incredibly lonely on this side of the fence. Since my attitude evolved I've realized that I can't talk to anyone anymore. Conversation is the hardest thing in the world because it's almost always based on "this is great/this is bad." Too many people hate too many things and I think that's crazy. It doesnt matter how much myself and another person agree on something; something will always come up that they hate and I will not be able to stand such a closed mind. That kind of attitude, I now feel, is incredibly juvenile. I feel like I'm too mature now and I just can't deal with that stuff. I want to be able to share everything that I think is great but I can't do that because no one will let me. Everyone is too judgemental,  too opinionated, too angry, too bitter, to dumb, too naive, and those who aren't too dumb are too blinded by their own narcissism and personal philosophies to see that their own intelligence doesn't matter (not to mention it's not too impressive and not too useful). We all have our specialities, our tallents, our "fields of expertice." One must learn, though, to embrace them and nurture them without flaunting them and trying to make others feel subordinated, because they're not, They're just different. (Granted there are some human-trash exceptions). Everyone has got something they do that's better than you, and it pisses you off when they think they're better than you because of it. To you their gift doesn't mean a thing. Superiority complexes seem to run standard issue with everyone anymore.   I am better than none of you.
