These motherfuckers have none, so I'm asking you A solid steel chair would replace The cig i want, cold steel hits my face A rush of blood to my head Lying on the floor, face forward, half dead Why don't you go dig a hole! I wake up losing all my self control I gave him a Whack! as he fell i brought a steel chair down on his back As i see blood drip slowly down his face the cig i want, a solid steel chair would replace
