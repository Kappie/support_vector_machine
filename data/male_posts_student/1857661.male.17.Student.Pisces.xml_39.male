I love changes in my life. But not all.   ~ Tomorrow will be a rather different routine to me. No more Interact Club, no more prefect duty, no more extra curriculur activities. Damn. I hate to study, study and study all day long. Studying everyday is just not the right style to me. Maybe I'll accompany my friend, PS2 more the next term. It shall be entertaining enough to keep me busy and awake.  Did this stupid thing just now when I visited  urlLink May Yenn's Journal.
