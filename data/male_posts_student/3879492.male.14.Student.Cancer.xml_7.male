Chorus: I seen some children crossing the bridge, what kind of life did they get to live? What kind of choice do they get to make, what if it was a childs mistake? I seen some children crossing the bridge, what kind of life did they get to live? What kind of choice do they get to make, what if it was a childs mistake? I seen some children crossing the bridge, what kind of life did they get to live? What kind of choice do they get to make, what if it was a childs mistake?
