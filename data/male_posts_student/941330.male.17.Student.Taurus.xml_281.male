FINE, yes, we'll have sex now. *proceeds with the most boring copulation ever witnessed on live public television* al gore, eat your heart out!  now, back to the matter at hand. i would like to take this worldwide stage, this bully pulpit, to announce to you all that i am, indeed, a girly-man.  yes, i know. hell of a shock to you all, isn't it. this coming from a man who came back from vietnam with nine combat medals, and proceeded to throw them all away. this coming from a man who has less personality than a three-toed sloth. this coming from a man who misses 75% of the vote in the senate, and out of the votes he does attend, half of those simply repeal the other half. this coming from a man who gets interviewed by espn the magazine about sports and still manages to talk about vietnam every other sentence. vietnam! this from a man who vietnam. i still love you, john. are we still down for singles' night on saturday? yes? whew. close one.   but, my fellow americans, i have to lay my soul bare to you all. yes, i am a girly-man. just like my good friends in the california state senate, who couldn't make a budget on time if they stood on a giant watch. just like the distinguished press corps across the west coast, whose only headlines consist of what an atrocious hypocrite that governor arnold schwarzenegger is to be a republican in california. just like ass-backward feminist groups who complain his derogatory label is the beginning of a vast right-wing conspiracy to instill homophobia in all americans and verbally grope every woman in the pacific time zone. oh, please, grope me ah-nold! why aren't you all laughing?   now, the obvious question pervading every nook and cranny of your psyche is, why the hell would i vote for you, girly-man? dammit, too much honesty again. erm, i meant your question was, why do i consider myself a girly-man? for one thing, i am john edwards' bitch. yes, to confirm rumors, the trunks in each of my 253 limousines have enough space for our miscreant liaisons. and believe me, we  do  need a lot of space, hee hee. no ... pants tightening ... must think ... unattractive ... rosie o'donnell's thighs ... ah, better. but on the other hand, i just feel in the past few months i haven't been a forthcoming "prospective candidate" for the democratic ticket. i've pretended john edwards isn't a vapidly smiling sue-happy buffoon. i've pretended i didn't marry my wife for her gazillions of dollars of net worth. i've pretended to wholly change my lame-ass personality when i'm still able to make chris tucker fall asleep.   in short, my fellow americans, i've lied to you all in the past, and i desire to repent for my egregiously sacriligious sins. so i hope that you will all come together with the kerry-heinz family -- and everybody in the democratic party who hasn't popped a vein while imitating howard dean -- to pray for penitence from my holy father, the token black voting bloc. thank you all, and may god bless america, but especially african-americans 18 and older.
