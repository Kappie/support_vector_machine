Normally I wouldn't be to worried, but tonight I am being observed by a different professor then I have been observed by. This prof that is about to observe me, doesn't seem to have a very high opinion about me from previous classes.       Now I feel and have been told that my skills with clients are right on the money for my experience level. I am worried about how she will evaluate my skills. I have a very difficult series of clients to work with tonight.       Well on another note... A good friend of mine has been accepted at UNT to begin working on her masters in counseling. I am really happy for her. More blogging tonight :)
