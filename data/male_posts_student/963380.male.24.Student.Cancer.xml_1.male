My mother and father were estranged - my mother was played by a taller woman than my real mother with silver blond hair. My father was played by James Caan. When I woke up a few moments ago, my "mother" had just accepted my "father" back into the family, and in the dream I was crying, I was so happy to have him back home. When I woke up, it was as if I'd been weeping for a good long time. My "father" was reading a book - everyone in this dream was reading books at one point, most of which I have read. A few I didn't recognize, but it didn't seem relevant. My father was trying to get something established about a design we were working on, it appears that this James Caan figure does what my dad does for a living. We were looking at a front view of what appeared to be a Reebok running shoe, having trouble understanding what each other meant about how some things fit together. He said he'd show me the model.  Earlier in the dream there was something about getting away from the police. With James Caan involved I can't help but think that this dream is a result of my oversaturation of mafia and mob films - Godfather I and II, The Sopranos and A Bronx Tale. Sonny, Michael's Estrangement and Calogero's desire to help the other Sonny as well as his love for his dad - all elements that I believe were encompassed in this dream.  I've got to say this dream was probably good for me. I've been a little stressed out of late, even with my desire and intention not to let things get to me. Having this "re-unification" with my "father" brought me to tears, and they say that tears cleanse the soul. I think I just got a free soul wash without having to pay for the gas.  I'm gonna go get my car now.
