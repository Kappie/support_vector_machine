Nice. Then, I got a 95 on a geometry test that I was sure I failed. That right there is enough to make my day. You don't understand my lack of talent when it comes to geometry. I suck...no, I  more   than suck...like, I  really   suck...bad. ANYWAYS. Then we had out first rehearsal for forum today and it kicked ass...except for the fact that my solo sucked...and no one could do the dance...and one of my best friends (I told you I'd put you in here!) wasn't there...ok, so maybe it wasn't the greatest rehearsal ever, but it's better than sitting on my ass at home pondering the questions that have plagued mankind forever. Like what are those weird little spots that appear when you stare at a light for a long time....or why cheese is yellow...or who the "they" in "that's what they say" is....or what in God's name that awful smell is...damn, what  is  that?!?
