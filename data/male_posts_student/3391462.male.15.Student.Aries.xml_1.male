Don't come off too strong because it can scare away people and you will need to work back their respect. The Fact is that I have ADD and making friends is a hard thing to come by but once you connect with those people that you know like you, you have hit the jackpot. After Months I figured out where in the "ranking" I was (mentally) among the students I tried hard to get to the top as fast as I could. But knowing my place, I knew that I couldn't acheive my goals alone. There is a point where you try to become friends with the most popular kids and you know they don't like you but you still want to be around them because of their coolness. I am one of those people that believe in Karma so to speak I mean I am Jewish and that is fun and all, but there are parts in the day that suck but are replaced with laughs and high fives. I then think to myself, I will make it, there is always true hope for the people that have worse desires. Just think before you act, and try to make the good times good and have fun! Thank you Cathleen you are one of my dearest friends!
