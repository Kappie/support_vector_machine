I hate it so much because this person has been the best thing to happen to me for a few years. But lately, things have been happening and the future is uncertain. What makes me so sick might soon become a reality.  I see two things as time will progress. I see this blog talking about the misery and suffering of getting over it, but secondly, I see this blog talking about the many days of happiness and contentment that this person still has to bring to me.  Do like I did, and ask yourself, which one would be better to read? The answer is quite obvious.  Sad endings are such a fucking clich√©.
