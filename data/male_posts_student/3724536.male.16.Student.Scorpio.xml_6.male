Spent the week in school getting the rest of our test results back, and of course for people who dont study like me, these are very terrible times. =P There were still a few humorous moments though, like the incident of kenneth's ciggerate for example, hence the title for this post(if u notice my links, ive even changed the name of his link.. lolz)   What happened u ask? Well contrary to what Szeyen said in his blog, i had actually read and seenKen's blog earlier, more specifically his new blog title beforeszeyen messaged me to tell me to look at it.=D When i first saw it, i was like WTF..?? i mean who intheir right minds wouldput a title like this?? quote from kens blog title :- " LIFE IS LIKE A CIGARETTE-it starts from a spark n you choose the type of life you want to live ."Laterthatnight when i saw szeyen online and toldhim about it, i found out our reactions were both the same, we boththought 'WTF???' when we saw it...althought he took it 1 step further by thinking to himself "what a dumbA$$" hahaha. Im quite sure Robyn's reaction must have been quite similar when she saw it, although i didnt really find out in detail. =D  Well u can imagine how annoyed we were at that time after seeing that title, since ciggerates is one of the last things we want ken to be mentioning.. lolz. But when we were talking about it the next morning in class between the 3 of us we actually found it quite amusing. Szeyen didnt want me to mention it to kenbut i still called him over and asked him about it. The Result? Endless laughter for almost a whole period!! lolz We ended up thinking of other stupid phrases like " life is like a lighter - light up other peoples ciggerate before your gas runs out " According to ken, he came up with that blog title after watching the movie Forest Gump and hearing Tom Hanks say " Life is like a box of chocolates "... although how he managed to draw a comparison between chocs and ciggs is totally beyond me...ahah  So that was the main highlight of the week, although there were other things such as the continuous drama of robyn and CJ(omg im gonna get skinned alive for saying this =P) and the first time doing qi gong during pjk period..haha There were also not-so-fun moments such as my streamyx not working for the whole of yesterday and this morning!! man that really got me annoyed..i thought i would have to call up streamyx and wait for a few days before getting my connection back. Luckily it started working again at about 2pm today..someone else must have already made a complaint before me ^^  Talking a little about movies.. i wanted to book tickets for king arthur this weekend but found out they were already all fully booked!! no thx to me not being able to book online on friday morning and by the time i tried to call in the afternoon it was already all booked =( To make matters worse Kill Bill 2 is also out in cinemas so that means there are two movies i want to seebut idont haveenough time to see both.. -__-"" Maybe ill go tomorrow and try for cancellation tickets...wish me luck!
