All these poloticians and leaders and coporations in charge of OUR lives, well well, then wat can we do? Sure Sure...let's make it our daily subject *mumbles* Ah, but i do see the seriousness in this...but let's just face the facts, we're not a part of this game. Meh, I dunno, im just going along like i normally do, i got one thing to say tho: STUPID! STUPID! STUPID! THIS WAR IS STUPID! SO IS  NE WAR  THAT TAKES PLACE *breaths* ja! ^-^
