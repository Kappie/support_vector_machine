Anyone panicking at this point needs a solid kick in the nuts. Of course this means that the three stooges are in full fledged code red Al Queda level panic.  Thursday afternoon - the K man gets back from a unit meeting and begins to illustrate how much of a beatdown is in store for the employees of our shop. This proceeds for an hour until I inform him that it's completely the opposite thing of what we'd call productive and he really needs to cut that shit out, pronto.  Cut to: Friday Morning, the lunchroom, my knuckles are white as I grip the suggestion box while leaning on it. I envision it's K's head and that I'm going to rip it open and boot his cerebellum across the parking lot. Beatdown after beatdown rains down for over 45 minutes in the most excruciatingly bad meeting I've ever been a part of. What I don't know is that it's part one. Saturday morning is part two. Needless to say, on both of these days, numbers are bad, morale is down and people just don't give a shit about doing a good job. After all, if you're told you're shit, who are you to argue?  Cut to: This morning. K's turning the meeting over to the Hip Hopper who goes about delivering a Panic Meeting - that is to say "well, we know the reasons you're giving us for things being bad, but they really don't add up" even though they really do - it's like there's this reality distortion field that decends on these people and they can't see forest, trees or anything else. It's a god damn shame - they should just donate their corneas to someone who would use them.  I'm getting pissed at this point. I know how to motivate people - it's a gift I've got - and I can do it without being an asshole. So I step in. I halt the whole proceeding and go right ahead and do my thing. Instead of getting cut off, I'm givin the floor and I run the rest of the meeting. As soon as I've said my piece I can see both managers and employees nodding, smiling and everyone seems a little more revved about things.   Then K starts going on about someone who works hard and is a perfect example of leadership and how to do things right. I think he's talking about Glennis until he says "I think Rob and Glen know who I'm talking about here..." and proceeds to say that I've been promoted to Senior Sales Associate.  God damn.
