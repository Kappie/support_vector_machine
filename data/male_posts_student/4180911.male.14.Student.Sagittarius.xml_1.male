I just went back to school a few days ago and I had piles of stuff to do so I didn't get time to write an entry while  that was going on but anyway I'm back and I'll be posting once every 2 days at least  Nothing much happened today, just another boring school day.  Although my french teacher is acting a bit weird.  He's usually always shouting and going off his head but he didn't today which I was surprised at.    Last night I started playing Fifa 2001 on my PC last night just for a while but it gre w on me and I ended up playing until early morning so I'm pretty tired as well.
