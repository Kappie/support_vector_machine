To celebrate, we went to 'Kobe: Steak House of Japan' with his friends, Kory and Jack, their parents, and Jack's sister and my good friend Molly. I love their soup, but it give me a horrible aftertaste for the next, oh, 26 hours. Their salad dressing is so amazing I can't describe it, and I had the calamari, salmon, and shrimp. It was all very good.  Uh, right now I'm watch a Star Trek movie. Despite the horrible acting, and other strangeities, I am very inclined to like Star Trek. This episode involves 419 year-old woman who looks like Maya Rudolph has fallen in love with Cptn. Picard. Also, there are these wrinkly people that look like Voldemort. I've decided the title should be Star Trek XXVII: Attack of the Voldermorts...and just as I was typing that the Head-Voldemort screamed madly.  Also, Candy (sophomore VP) and I decided on 'Viva Las Vegas' as the theme for this year's homecoming. For a preview of the possible t-shirt design, click  urlLink http://customink.com/cink/r.jsp?E=cooperlewis%40cox.net&F=kmchc1 . I'm excited.  It looks like the inside of the gym is going to be modeled after the famous casinos. The perimeter will be divided into about 7 panels, each depicted a Casino, like Caesar's Palace, uh, and a bunch of other stuff...Circus, Circus...the medieval one, the Aladdin. Stuff like that. Oh and the lobby will have craps tables and roulette stuff. The breathalizers will be dressed in dealer vests and visors, and if you pass the breathalizer, you'll be able to walk through the Jackpot.  Also, the picture backdrop is the "Chapel-O-Love"
