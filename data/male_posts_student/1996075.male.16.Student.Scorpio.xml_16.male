I have taken numerous amounts of quizi (lol) and here are the results I have gotten (some of them are kind of funny) :  "Are you weird?" - Results:  You are a very unique individual. You perceive things unlike many others do. You find beauty in the essence of yourself and the things people often take for granted. You are very intelligent and you see the whole picture. You do have the tendency to become a bit shy, but not because you lack the social skills. Just because your such a deep thinker and intellectual and you find it as a conflicting factor in your life for you to easily relate to others. You value your alone time and find it a priority to seek out knowledge to strengthen your foundation of what you truly believe in. You are a very special person, don't let anyone contradict that.   "Will you fall in love? (for girls)" - Results: Yes you will fall in love!!! You love being with people and you are ready to find the right someone, or u found them! Your sweet and guys always like you and being around you!    "What holiday are you?" - Results: You're Halloween, The scariest holiday of the year, you love to scare people, dress up and eat candy.   "which of my friends or me are you ;boys and girls;" - Results:  Congrats!!! You are Me! Youâ€™re also called Carly, and sometimes baby but only by Brian!

Tough and independent, you can deal with many situations with your quick thinking and sharp wit. People like you become successful- lazy people drive you insane--so pack your bags and head out!   "What water sport should you play (in the pool)?" - Results: You're a synchronized swimmer! (my personal favorite) Why swim when you can synch?

"What type of dog are you? " - Results: You're a Golden Retriever. The beginner's dog, there's no one that doesn't like you. Sure, you shed... you take a bit of extra grooming, but what you lose in hairballs and brush fibers, you make up for in loyalty and friendliness. You're easy to train, adapt easily to new situations, and don't drool much.    "which of my insane frineds are you? (boys and girls)" - Results: You are Holli. Red hair, green eyes, and a personality to boot. You certainly are a catch for any guy. You are hyper and fond of swearing without fear.
