"made") and it just distracts you from the good parts of those movies (at least for me)... but he plays this part really well.  if you're one of those people that looks down on these movies, have no sense of humor, and never laughs or doesn't enjoy laughing... don't go see this movie.  but DO frickin lighten up a little jeez!  nothing worse than people that can't laugh at things and give D's to these kinds of movies in their reviews.  who says movies have be serious all the time?  laughter is GOOD!
