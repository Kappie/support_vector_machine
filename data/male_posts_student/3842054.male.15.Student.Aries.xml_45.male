If they tell me to get naked, i wont.   Today was another boring day. Blah. Im starting ot write lyrics for no reason. And im making two storyboards a day. Im ready for school. Im ready for the communications department again. Im ready to work. Im ready to see my friends. Im ready to ride the train. Im ready to get stressed out again. I NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE!!!! Yeah, im just posting for the heck of it.  Um, ive decided that I do not like the show "Wanna come in" I really hate it and it makes me angry. Im not going to explain because i will get angry and punch myself in my already disloacted arm. Well, i have some lyrics that i wrote today. Not anything from anyone else. Ill post songs that i wrote in other posts later on. Im not a musican. But i love music, and i like to write so i combined them. Music really is poetry in motion...  Love Song Bobby Seifter    >Sitting in the shower Looking at myself  Looking at an image that is you >        But you are not here  No we're more than miles apart And i think oh dear Here i go >       No this is not a love song  Oh how could it be Cuz your not even here   Chorus No noones really here And I'm not even in love >       And as I sit here  Wanting so bad. To be tangled up in your arms, That do not exist >       But i want them to be here  Oh I want them so bad To feel those arms To love those arms That are around my neck   (Chorus) >       But this has never happened.  No, this has never happened. And this will never happen Before  That is Love Song. But it isnt a love song... remember that.
