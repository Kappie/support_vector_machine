If you aren't up on your Spanish politics, let me recap.  Spain, along with Britain, was one of the primary allies in the Iraqi war.  They have around 1,600 troops in Iraq, and the Prime Minister, Aznar, put his neck on the line to help us, just like Tony Blair.  Just prior to the terror attacks, Aznar's party was in a tight race.  The muslims come along and murder 200 people a few days before the elections, and the Spanish people go into revolt.  As a result, the Socialist Party wins in a landslide.  The first thing the new Spanish PM vows is to yank the troops out of Iraq and offered support to John Kerry.  Lessons - The Muslims have learned if you whack a European hard enough, he'll comply with your wishes.  Instead of offering defiance and standing firm, the Spanish people rolled over and gave in.  They blame Bush for the Train attacks.  This type of thing seems to be endemic in Europe, and we should all take our own lesson from that.  The European way of appeasement is not the answer.  I'm sure there are many a sensible Spaniard who are in mental agony over the results of thier election.  I know I would be ashamed.  This is really a major even in the War on Terror, and it will cost us allies in the future.  Europe does not have enough Blairs to stand up against Islam.  And the Murderous Thugs of Mohhamed are encouraged to strike out again and again, exposing the softness in Europe.  If they slaughter another 1,000 Americans in late October, what will that do to our elections?  I'd like to believe that we would display the same resolve that held us together on 9/12 and beyond.  I'd like to think we would rally around resistence and defiance, rather than give in.  But I am increasingly concerned about our own level of committment and determination to preserve freedom.  As I've said, this election might be one of the most crucial elections since the 50s.  I think this might be a bloody year as the Muslims work to apply pressure against the current administration and policy.  How many people will be killed in an attempt to turn us away from confrontation?
