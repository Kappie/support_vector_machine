At the end of the trip, they give all the field trippers a FREE FRIGGIN' XBOX!  She doesn't play video games, so guess what she's giving me next time we meet!  Oh no.  My life is now going to be dedicated to the console version of  urlLink  Morrowind Game of the Year Edition.  What is a boy to do...
