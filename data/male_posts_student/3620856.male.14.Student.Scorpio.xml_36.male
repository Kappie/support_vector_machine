I made weird liquids in test-tubes, while Khai Wah made a 'flash bang'. He took 6 strips of magnesium and tied them to a stick. Then he lighted the magnesium strips. The strips glowed so brightly that it attracted everyone. Soon, everyone started copying what he did. Then there was Jesse. He lit a magnesium ribbon, and passed it to Bertrand. Bertrand was playing a fool, so he took the lighted magnesium and swing it around in the air. The burning magensium ribbon broke away from the stick, and landed on Bertrand's hair. His hair was burning and he didn't notice it until 10 seconds later. The whole class was laughing away... But, it ain't funny, if your hair caught fire. Then, Chem Yeo, the teacher, got angry and shouted at the class, yadda yadda yadda... Same old story as always... Ending up getting scolded, bla bla bla....    In life, we gotta lose something to gain something... We may also lose our lives and gain popularity... Isn't it weird? We always gotta lose something, before we get something... That's always the case... Cruel life....
