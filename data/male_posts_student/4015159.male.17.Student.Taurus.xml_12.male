If people want they can give me ideas for tasks, they first task will be revealed today to be done tomorrow. Everyday I pass a task I'm going to put 1 pound in a jar, if pass every task then at the end of the holidays I should be up about fifty quid. Who knows, it may be so succesful I may carry on doing it afterwards!            The First Task            Tomorrow I will only be allowed to drink water (apart from milk on my cereal). Every morning when I get up I have a cup of tea, today my mum bought 12 cans of coke and 8 bottles of Yazoo Milkshake... will I be able to resist enough to complete the task? Find out tomorrow.            PS: I will not be lying about the tasks, I will say if I havefailed!
