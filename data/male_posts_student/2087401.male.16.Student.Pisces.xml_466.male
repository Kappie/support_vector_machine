You are sentenced to wear the (brand new!) Hat of Ill-Repute, forever and ever until the end of your days.  JournalCon date is (until someone tells me otherwise) May 7th-8th. We're doing Season Two of Sports Night in all it's horrible Dating Plan glory.  I'm working on a review of The Pajama Game, It'll be at What Kind of Day Has It Been tomorrow, unless I get lazy and maybe it won't ever get anywhere.  All I have to say is, Sophia, you missed a hell of a show.  The Betty-one looks drowsy!
