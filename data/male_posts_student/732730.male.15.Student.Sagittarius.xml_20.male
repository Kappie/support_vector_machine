Six kilometers of joy. I only walked three kilometers, and I got pissed off and sat down under the tent. AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW!  As part of our school betterment program, the students are doing a S.W.O.T. (Strengths, Weaknesses, Oppurtunities and Threats) analysis. So, most of the points brought up were about the lack of cleanliness around the school. Like lack of clean toilets, poor looking gardens and the such. One of the points brought up though, was the scabbiness of the school's  urlLink web site .   And I agree. Look at the scabbiness! It's ugly. So some of the girls (namely Tara and Tanya) enlisted me to redesign the schools website. Well, I haven't been enlisted yet, but I can only assume that the piece of paper is sitting on his desk, and Mr Mason is thinking "Hmm... I don't like that Adam boy anyway".
