I'm not that disappointed to be honest and I'm definitely getting over her. As I said yesterday, there are plenty more oppurtnities and I'll just use this as an experience to learn from. Better to experience failure now than to have it hit you in the face later in life.  We (us and our parents) had this talk about an hour ago at school by a retired university admissions tutor. He outlined the admission process, how to use it to your advantage and so on, which was fairly interesting. It was intruiging to know that there are less Computer Science applicants in recent years and it's also going to be easier to get in if I deffer my entry to 2006, which I will be. It got me all enthusiastic about uni again and you know, I can't wait to just get out of school and off on my gap year, then straight there. I've realised that there's far too much to look forward to for me to be worying about some girl I didn't get.
