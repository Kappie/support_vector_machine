He got up late with the sun shining lightly into his room creating a faint tint to the green color encompassing his room.  But he was going to have just a lazy day and hopefully work on his english paper but he didn't get to.  Instead he decided to tag along with his mom when she went out to North Bend to do some shopping.  He hasn't done this in quite some time and it was actually somewhat fun.  He got some pants and a shirt and his mom said he needs to start looking for stuff for college next year (mainly wintry stuff cuz of the weather) and she recommended looking for coats.  So he decided that he liked one coat he saw enough to buy it.  He still needs to get another warm one but his mom is buying all this stuff so he really doesn't care.  He doesn't exactly like shopping but he loves getting new clothes.  At least, when they look good.  Tyke likes to be fashionable but really it isn't that big of a deal.  He wants to kind of be his own trendsetter but he really isn't at all.  He is just following some modern trends or even trying to be retro with something that was worn back in the day.  But clothes are still fun if they look good or funny.  Anyway, to be less boring Tyke will close that chapter of this blog and move on.  Tyke has a really good family friend that is going to New Zealand for a year to work and live so there was a party for him.  He is Tyke's brother's age and he has a sister that is Tyke's age.  They all went to the same preschool so they have really known each other for 17 years.  And the father is one of the weatherman at KING 5.  He was Tyke's connection to get his "job" at KING.  So that was really fun.  They reminisced about old times like when they would play with the "Navy Pink Bear" or play basketball with Bob Barker Kabuki or even play Jeopardy with players such as Mini-Chest and Mimi Bobek-occupation Drew hater.  Of course Tyke was the one with the innovation to make all of these names up.  He has been how he is now his whole life folks.  Believe you him.  He also saw a girl that he hasn't seen for years and they used to hang out together too.  And then another girl came over so it was Tyke and 3 girls.  Ya know, the use.  Don't worry, the girls have no interest in Tyke nor does he have any interest in them.  They have just been friends for a while.  Tyke is friends with a lot of girls in his life.  Pretty much all his life he has about as many girls as friends as guys.  But that is how he has wanted it so that is how it has been.  He still remembers when he got angry when someone was teasing him about one of his friends that was a girl and called her his girlfriend.  He came home and talked to his mom about it and realized that she was his girlfriend cuz she was a girl and a friend.  And that was the end of his anger.  It was much easier to get over things back then.  Pretty much just took something new to get his mind off anything.  And for some reason he just had a flashback to when he went out into his garage and since they had mice in the house there were mouse traps.  So one day he didn't see it and he stepped on it.  But oddly enough it didn't hurt.  So he was like, wow how does a mouse get killed by that ish?  But he was still young so he probably said it more like, "How do the mouth get died by the twap mommy?"  And she probably responded with, "Umm...well...er...Hey look Fer-Fer is outside."  Fer-fer was the deer that frequently visited the Turner house and Tyke named it after himself cuz he was so in love with deer.  Still is really.  But now it is just a fondness for the beauteous species.  Rather than an obsession.  His obsessions have matured from then if you know what he means.  Wink wink, etc.  Back to his night though, he came home and played a little bball downstairs.  Then watched Saturday Night Live.  Which is neither live nor televised solely on Saturday night.  So they are basically lying to the entire population with that title.  Eh, still Jessica Simpson was on it and she is just so damn fine that there is no way Tyke wouldn't watch it.  Sounds like Tyke has a certain type he likes for girls (not that this is all he looks for of course but as a pattern he has noticed this).  Blonde, buxom, sweet and innocent (if only seemingly).  BBSI.  Now ya know what that means.  Tyke actually is B, S, and I.  Not the second B of course though.  Unless you count his enlarged pectoralis major muscle.  But that is just cuz of his chest deformation and insane strength.  Tyke has quite a string of consecutive nights in which he has blogged.  Could be up to like 50 days now.  But probably less.  Anybody wanna count and let him know?
