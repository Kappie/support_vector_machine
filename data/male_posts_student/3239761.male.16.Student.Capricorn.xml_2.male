There will probably be a grand total of 3 people who ever glance at this. It’s been a week, and for not having a life I really have no time.  I made a little kid cry on the bus. And if you watch the bus can video it looks like I was beating him up also. One little kid on the bus is such a jerk. He sits ahead of me, and all the way home, he throws things at you, beats on the seat, whacks you on the head, and beats up his sister. And today it was the end of it. He whacked me on the head with a roll of paper, so I grabbed it and through it to his sister, Video View: 'I took the kids papers, taunting him, and gave them to his sister so that he would go after her.' Then I was sick of him whacking his sweater up and over the seat at me, trying to get me annoyed, so I yanked them out of his hand and told him to stop while leaning over the seat. Video View 'I ripped them out of the hands of an innocent little boy and then yelled at him over the seat and threw it at his head.' And then, he was flinging seatbelts at me from over the top. I jumped up and tried to look intimidating, (Works rather well sometimes, I'm huge when I want to be), and then I reached down and tickled him because he was in a ball. Three seconds later, he screams in pain and begins crying. He jolted when I tickled him and whacked his head on the window edge, probably did hurt like heck. VIDEO View: 'I got really angry then beat him up and threw him against the window'. So now I’m just waiting for the phone call from the parents asking why I hit their little angel.  ~~ Yes, It Does Suck, as does my life (now I know I have one)
