I put Ella inside and ran back down to see what the problem was.  He said his leg was hurting and he wanted to go inside to sit in his chair.  I helped walk him to his chair and he sat down, he said his leg felt like it was asleep.  He said if it got worse he would call for an ambulence.  I really should have called or done something else.  I made sure he was comfortable, he seemed to relax once he was in his chair.  Maybe I'll check on him later today.  Wow, I really felt helpless.
