After that, I went offline to eat chee cheong fun. Hmm. After that, I went to the basketball court near WQ's house early.  I want to spend some quality time reading mah book.    Yeah. I reached there around 10.30. I brought along Rice Bowl, by Christine Lim. I love the protangonist. She reminds me of me. Her great attitude, her thinking. Almost like mine. Non-conventional, controlversial. Yeah. Her boyfriend is the people I don't really like. Those people who accept everything the government tell them, who is so prim and proper. I quote you one thing he said "Singapore is a small nation. We can't afford defiance, rebellion and constant questioning of government policies." NONSENSE!! You mean to tell me to accept what the government said blindly and unquestioning like obedient little dogs? Pui! Never in my life! Of course, Marie is very wise to break up with him. Meow moo!!  Okay. Moo meow! KS, CQ and WQ came, followed shortly by Gloria. Okay. The court was full at first, but after waiting, it was emptied of players. We meowed at the court. The team formation of me, CQ and KS proved too formidable, so we decided to play ABC till Joyce came. Hmm. I made great improverments in ABC! Woo hoo! I can "cross the river" le! Such a miracle! Joyce came and we played ABC again! Meow moo meow!! After that, we played and played till 1.  Yeah. At 1, we went to Causeway Point to eat lunch. Hmm. We went to McDonalds to eat. Yes! Even ducks meow! Even the cat ate the McNuggets Meal. Yes! After that, they wanted to go watch movie. Hmm. WQ suggested After School, I suggested Butterfly Effect and Joyce wanted Big Fish. Hmm. After a lot of deliberation and some compromising, we agreed on Butterfly Effect.  It was not long waiting, as we brought the tiks to a show 15 minutes later. Not many cats are watching it, so we meowed a lot of tiks. Yes! We went in and sat down. Oh yes!! They are showing Harry Potter's trailer!! POA's trailer is so nice, even though I have it in my computer. Heh Heh! Okay. Onto the movie. The Chaos Theory is so true. Every little actions can affect the future dramatically. I didn't catch onto the story until like the middle of the show, when I finally understood how he use his power to change his life. Wow! A great movie! At the end, WQ said he wanted Ashton's power (Ashton Kutcher plays Evan...great actor!). Hmmm. It would be cool yeah, but like what Evan's father said, it is too dangerous. Yes!!   After that, we walked down. Hmmm. I wanna accompany WQ wait for his brother, so Gloria walked back with CQ and Joyce. Yes, me, KS, WQ and TZ (who joined KS to accompany WQ)n walked around till WQ's brother came. Hmm. I saw Wendy walking with KL. I waved hello. However, my eyebrows were raised high and eyes wide open. Yeah. After his brother and father came, I went home lor.  I went home, bathed, came online (left computer on) and ate dinner. HaHa. I was quite slow today, because I was reading Rice Bowl. After dinner, I surfed some Internet and went to watch my show. I am online now, tada!  Okay. What was I about to write? Oh yes. HAHAHA! Today, Ji messaged "Am I good to you? HaHa!" When I was reading that, I laughed out real loud, and WQ called me siao. It placed a big smile on my face. I can't say why CQ messaged that, but meow moo! CQ one of my most treasured friends. He is always there for me...and I appreciate that a lot. Hmm. He has very different perspective on the issue, unlike Amanda and Wendy. What he said made a lot of sense too. Yeah...so there I am. Stuck in a knot of what to do next. Heh Heh. His words gave me something to think about. HaHa! :D  Hmmm. Oh yes. Today, I heard something I thought would never be played out in radio. Jamie read a message from a guy to another guy "I love you". She commented "I know you will find it strange that a guy telling another guy 'I love you', but I don't think I am supposed to comment on that, so I won't." The song dedication is "Fuck It (I Don't Want You Back)" by Eamon. Yeah, I find it very strange. Why would someone dedicate Fuck It to someone they love? I would dedicate songs like "Truly Madly Deeply" or "One Love" or "You Make Me Wanna". Hmmm!!   Okay. I gotta go now. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
