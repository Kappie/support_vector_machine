A cellphone will always be a cellphone. that is, to CALL people. However, because Filipinos are naturally DUMB, (remember the water-powered car by Daniel Dingel which could have ended our dependency on oil but the fucking government lacked the political will?) these gadgets are happily consumed by the populace, mainly the social climbers and techno-geeks. Though i don't see a camera phone as an evil invention, using this phone to capture nude pics of female species isn't very morally gratifying. Just buy a 3310 and a camera!  Much, much cheaper.  75 million Filipinos think that Nokia Phones are cool. (Stole this idea from www.maddox.xmission.com since I am a plagiaristic bastard)
