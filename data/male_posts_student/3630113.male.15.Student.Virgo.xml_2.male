Wouldn't say the 85 bucks spent was entirely worth the performance, considering much improvisation could be made to make the performance much much better, and some people could even enjoy the music despite not paying a single cent.  Ah well, caught up with Jon at orchard first to watch around the world in 80 days...another typical jackie chan movie...filled with innovative ideas to stir laughter among audiences around the world, and non-stop action. It was kinda cool seeing all the various stars guest-starring for the movie, but well, didn't think it was THAT good...think i've watched too many jackie chan movies...kinda know how things turn out in his movies..so well...didn't find it that intriguing.  John smsed me at 6+ and told me that was already a huge crowd of people at the padang, so Jon and I rushed down to city hall, and tried to get dinner. omg..15 minutes lapsed as we were queueing up to wait for our turn at BK, but we were still waiting for our turn...damn...guess almost everyone at BK was buying dinner and were going down for the LP concert. At around 720, it was such a long queue stretching all the way from the main entrances all the way along the pavement to just outside SRC. So well, we crossed the road from Raffles city, and i told Jon to join the queue while i checked out if we were in the correct queue..ahah..realised that some singaporeans aren't that smart...they notice a queue they'll just join it. Popped up at the entrance which caused the long queue, realised that he was in the wrong queue, that entrance was only for ppl who purchased 150 dollar tix. The queue for the 85 dollar tix was so short..we got in only in a matter of 5 minutes. It was kinda lame, saw Denise from MTV going up to ppl asking them to sing linkin park songs and stuff...man..she's real thin. But very hot... =p  Saw so many people crowding near the front..especially John and 4F ppl...i went to check out the view from their perspective...i don't think they could even see the stage properly...lol...so Jon and I went towards the back to sit down on the grass...wow. We had a good view of the stage and pleasant ventilation as well. lol.  man..we waited all the way till 820 when Dan and Sheikh from perfect 10 came in to attempt to kick things off and get the crowd all psyched up and stuff. So well, they introduced this korean band, which LP probably admires, cuz they invited the korean band to start things off..oh man..we paid 87 bucks not to watch some korean band..but LINKIN PARK!!! Geez..everyone around was like shouting "Go back to seoul!!! Go home!!!" Don't think we were too evil... =) They performed till about 850...and everyone around were eagerly anticipating for LP to finally get on stage and rock the house. But crap...they shua da pai...didn't come out till bout 920..but well...they really kicked things off quite well..getting the entire crowd on their feet, enjoying the music , dancing to the beat of the music.  It was quite fantabulous..15000 ppl(that's wat dan ong said) in one voice...dancing, singing in one voice..and everyone hopping up and down, flailing their arms tirelessly, going delirious, enjoying a performance put up by one of the greatest bands in the world in unison. It was damn cool...i was bouncing up and down like i was walking on fire, but in fact i wasn't..i was having one of the greatest times in my life..i was on the verge of losing my voice..but ah...heck cared...and i continued to attempt to sing...i finally realised what's the diff between going to a rock concert and just watching the show on tv or just listening to their music...it's something that cannot be experienced unless you actually go for the concert. It's a glorious feeling...blending in with the crowd...and being with so many hardcore enthusiasts...and being part of the concert itself. Or perhaps it's just with LP...shall quote lyndsey..."LP have got amazing stage presence.." I can't agree more...  Wow, the concert was really uber-good..perhaps only for the last 90 minutes or so...haha...the crowd was kept well captivated in a sense of ecstasy, exuberance, exhilaration, and exhaltation. LP made us seem like WE were the stars of the concert, not them.   Parents made me leave just one song earlier...but i managed to catch it on my way out...and i heard the entire gig ending.. OMG..i saw the entire pavement across the road...just outside St Andrew's Cathedral filled with swarms of people, all listening to LP...for FREE. wat the hell...really couldn't believe it...there were people on the grass just listening...ppl on city hall steps trying to take a glance...wow...LP is really quite fantastic...Got onto the train just before the main crowd got to city hall...so i'm considered quite fortunate i guess..haha..  LP's really incredible..they totalled rocked singapore on 22nd June!!! LP rocks!
