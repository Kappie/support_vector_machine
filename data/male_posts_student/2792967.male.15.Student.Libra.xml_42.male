There is allmost nothing I hate more than the rancid-sess-pools-of-anti-culture-black-holes-of-action-and-exitment-sucking- -smothering every last particle of my sanity. In a city, you go out, you dont have to be doing something, just go out. You cant just go out in Denver. I just cant stand it anymore. Post Later.
