More and more patients are receiving a phone call reminding them of their appointment with a certain health facility a week before the scheduled time.  Although this seems like a small innovation the benefits can be tremendous.  These telephone systems are able to link patients with an operator if necessary.  This is important because if a patient has to reschedule their appointment they can connect with the operator and proceed with the change.  This should make appointment scheduling and confirming a much simpler task.  Also, only one operator is needed to at any one time.  A computerized voice will inform patients that their appointment is drawing near and if they have no concerns then they are free to hang up and the call is ended.  In the event they can't make the appointment or they have a question about something they can talk to a live person and get the service they need.  This should make patients feel better-served and the reminder should help to lower the number of no-shows that a facility has.  I am all for any technology that can make a facility a better or more efficient place.  This technology certainly has the ability to do both.  I expect a lot more facilities to adopt these type of automated callers in the near future.
