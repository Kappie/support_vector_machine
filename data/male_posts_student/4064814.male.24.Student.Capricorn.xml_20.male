If we are heading out to the trail I will be the last person to volunteer for carrying the spare inner tube, lightweight pump, or anything of the other small things you  need  to have with you on the trail.  In fact I will try just about anything to be the guy not carrying anything simply because it  adds weight .  So you can imagine my excitment when I found I came across  urlLink wrenchscience , a site that allows you to choose from a bunch of custom frames and then completely outfit all the components,  but  best part is that as you go it tells you how much weight each component will add.  I spent at least an hour fooling around on the site and managed to create the following masterpiece:   									       Frame:DEAN Colonel X-Lite         Fork: ROCK SHOX SID Race 2004     Group: X.0 2004         Weight:    19.66lbs         Price:  only  $4,960.95 USD   Or perhaps a road bike:      									       Frame: GIANT TCR Composite       									Frame size: 51cm C-to-T      									Fork: GIANT SL      									Group: Record 10spd 2004      									Wheelset: Factory Wheel      Weight:    14.3lbs          Price:  a mere  $5,784.62         I am pretty happy with the weight of my  urlLink Klein  right now, but man that giant would be litterally half the weight.
