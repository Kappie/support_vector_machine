Got a lot of insight on a number of things, like teenagers suiciding and the conclusion for the Andrea suit (oh...she won 900k, but the case against TaiMing was dismissed! YaY!). Mother came back with breakfast (chee cheong fun). We watched TV and read newspaper till 11.  At 11, I alternated between watching Huan Zhu Ge Ge and chatting online with XC and WQ. So meowingly confusing. At 12.30, I went offline to eat lunch and watch Huan Zhu. And yaY! Good news! Courts approved us to buy the copier! YaY!! Meow meow! We will be picking it up tomorrow.   After that, wendt online a little and did a thourogh sweep of my system using McAfee virus scan. Then, I went offline to play FFIX. Alright! FFIX update! I managed to beat the Grand Dragon. Just user Flare a couple of times and some Blizzaraga here and there should do the trick. It sucks to have him use Thundaga on the whole party...but oh well. I managed to level up 5 levels, then I off to surdf the net.  Oh god! I slept from 5 to 6.30. I slept and slept...gosh! I was really tired. I woke up at 6.30 with a horrifying feeling. I didn't buy dinner for me and brother!! Darn you know!! I walked to the 768 feeling so tired. And I decided not to buy any dinner for myself. Go eat the bowl noodles at home. Too lazy to eat a "fulling" dinner. I even brought the wrong dinner for brother. HaHa.   Came back home, bathed, cooked noodles and ate them while surfing internet. Ayiah...pretty common stuff la.I think I end this le. Too tired to type le. See ya tomorrow. Goodnight blog.
