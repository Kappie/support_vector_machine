I have practice today for high school and our first match is next saturday, so im siked cuz the season is about to start. Well anywayz 6th period was a bitch cuz we had to run 9 lapz around the track, and i had major crampage, so i felt like a fat person tryin to run for the first time in his/her life. Yeah, so thats it, bye now
