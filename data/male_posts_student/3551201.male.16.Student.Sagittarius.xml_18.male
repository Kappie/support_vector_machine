Renegade Chic Lara Flynn Boyle   Left Coast Report  Every now and then we see a Tinseltowner who's willing to buck the liberal trend.   Hollywood's newest nonconformist is a former star of "The Practice," Lara Flynn Boyle.    The actress has stepped forward to pledge her support for the current object of Hollywood's disaffection, President Bush.   Boyle has been busy since the cancellation of "The Practice" working on a recurring role in a new Showtime drama called "Huff." She portrays a manic-depressive patient of the title character. Showtime plans to debut the series in November.   "I'm Irish Catholic, so a Democrat by blood. But I'm 100 percent for Bush. I want my president to be like my agent: not afraid of people, but wants my best interest," Boyle told World Entertainment News Network.   The Left Coast Report thinks Boyle's agent might hail from a red state.
