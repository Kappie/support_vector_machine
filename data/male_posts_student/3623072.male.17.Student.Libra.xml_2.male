It was almost  2 o'clock  in the afternoon.. hahaha As u may have notice dat I Slept late again last nite, been up all nite talking with Emily about have to do the splits like my idol wrestle  ROB VAN DAM   did. So taught me some strecthes to accomplish the splits that i awaited. And then she showed photos of her doin some strecthes even the splits. Which was  amazing  to me and she told me that it'll take time so i need a lot of determination and patience.    Now, back to this afternoon, hehe well i received a msg from my very old classmate during primary school. And now she's stAying In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. She told me that she's in Brunei within this 2 weeks! And she asked me out today if i wasn't busy. Yipee!  Its been like 6 years we havent met.  :)  Unfortunately, i cant go out with her cos i have to revise this STUPID ASEAN quiz. Which its starting to ruin my holiday LIFE!!*aRGH* EVRY SINGLE, this quiz sometime makes me so crazy cos i really have to memorize all the IMPORTANT DATES AND EVENT..  ;(     Hm..
