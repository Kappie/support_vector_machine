It was announced on Thursday, August 28th that such a contest would be held. Although no contest entries have been received as of yet, the contest is in effect.  Writer  Nick Brown  provided information about the contest and why it is being held. "For one, it will generate a lot of interest for the readers to read something funny and interesting!" Brown commented, "And it will give both, J.R. and myself something to blog about!" This made the contest seem more of a publicity stunt than anything, Brown denies that, "It is not a publicity stunt at all, its just a way to get more interest into the already slow going blog."  The end date for the contest has not been announced yet, but apparently entries are being taken.  ------------------ Related Sites:     urlLink Three Eye Witnesses
