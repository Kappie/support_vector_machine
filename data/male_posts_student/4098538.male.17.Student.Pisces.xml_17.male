Spent the afternoon with Amanda today... was a really nice night. She's so lovely. We finally formed a band onTuesday. Well, we got some people together who want to start a band and we are actually gonna be taking it VERY seriously this time. First practice is tomorrow night. Already thinking of band names. Funny one was 'Wasted Energy' and a picture of a stoned battery to go with it. Still not decided on a fixed sound either.Collectively, wewanna make music in the style of Sepultura, Incubus, Misfits, Chimairaand Superjoint. What a sound that will be... each band is completely different. Gonna be a wicked party tonight at my mate Gavins house. Gonna be lots of chronic and alcohol. So I guess I should go try and sleep so I ain't too tired, asI wanna go get my hair braided in the morning. But I can't sleep damn it! Hmm, I'm gonna go do some writing. For now, in a bit.
