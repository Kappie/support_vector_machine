I found a black one with all the stuff I wanted - I'm a little concerned though, well, kind of happy - from the bill of sale I receieved - these guys forgot to charge me for all the accessories that I wanted. I went with black after they parked a black one and a silver one side by side. That and the fact that 90% of the cars on the road are silver. gah. Stupid Japanese and their metallic paints. I'm a little sad to see my other car go. It's been so good to me - it was the first car I ever got into an accident in while driving (well, actually while sitting still - I was rear ended). It has some other Ray Barrone-esque sentimental value as well - but we shan't go into that. I don't know if this is the first stage of seperation anxiety, but I'm gonna miss the little guy.  Just finished watching the second season of The Soprano's. That show is tearing my heart out. I'm loving it. It's really an emotional rollercoaster. It's kind of interesting - my life seems to be going decently - I think I'm being depressed vicariously through James Gandolfini.
