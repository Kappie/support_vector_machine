I told Melissa today about my sexuality mainly because I really trust her, so maybe I'll be able to tell everyone else... I feel really good right now. Im worried though, not about melissa but of telling other people about me im not sure if im ready yet i want to so bad... well thats all i can write right now because people are annoying me... thanks melissa youre awesome!
