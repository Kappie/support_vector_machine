But we have just recived our quarterly phone bill and it was a bit steep. At present we pay £80 a month for cheaper phone calls and free after 1800 phone calls etc, yet the phone bill was an extra £86 over this, shit. This is mainly because with the (gay) BT 1571 service, although it costs the user nothing, it costs the person calling 42p just to hear "the person you are calling are either looking at porn or having amindless boaring conversation so call back later you dumb fuck we are taking all your money" or whatever it says. It also costs the same with mobiles to hear the "the person you are caling are too stupid to know how to turn on their phone this could be because they are either a mong or a girl.". What a rip off, BT are making loads of money out of people not being able to get through, how tight!. {[political rant, ignore if you are not a looser like me] This is all because of bloody Thatcher and her "free" market economy, and privatising all the national companies so in the end the fat cats at the top of BT get loaded with cash whilst everyone else gets fucked, bitch! [end of rant]} So I won't be using the phone that much for a while, i'll just have to let others waste their parents phone bill. Anyway sorry about all that you probably really don't give a toss. But this is a blog and it's good to keep in topuch even if it is only small things. Alex
