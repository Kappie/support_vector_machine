The Euro Cup juz gave me a new night life, and that is watchin soccer...well before the whole soccer thing came up i was like playin console or online games or even goin out till very late...hahax until the Euro Cup came up, it was like a change to my night life lol but sad to say that the Euro Cup will be ending real soon.  Some things are juz too fast when you aren't paying attention to them. Sometimes you juz have to give up the things you want the most...  Life isn't that bad when you know how to enjoy it...make every second useful and not let one single breath get wasted. Hahax haiz...goin to watch Cze vs Greece now...whose gonna win well my guess is Cze may win it, we juz have to see...
