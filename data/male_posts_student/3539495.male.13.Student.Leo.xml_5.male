You know, everythings so much money there. I swear to god, you can buy a cup of ice cream for the same price of half a gallon of ice cream from the supermarket. Cousins came over, we talked for a while. They never come... but anyways. Missed Alex's party, that was supposed to be fun. But at least i skirted another encounter with death. I burned so many cds over the weekend, Guns n Roses, Smashing Pumpkins, Pink Floyd, AC/DC, Bob Dylan. Now my cd case's heavier, makes me feel good. Which reminds me... BOB DYLANS COMING TO BROCKTON!!!!!!!!!!!!! Tickets arent for sale yet, but the European tour tickets are. 52 dollars, quite a bargain if I do say so myself. So, I might just go on the Germany tour. Just wont understand what the announcer person is saying. But i really cant wait. Bob Dylan is the man. Heres the site to get the info, http://bobdylan.com/live/. In fact, I'm listening to his cd right now to commerate this joyous day. WHOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
