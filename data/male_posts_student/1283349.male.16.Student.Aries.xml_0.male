So, to start off, let's get some fact straight:  I am: a fan of damn good music (what meets this pre-req? We'll talk about that, young padawan) a gamer, though not the stinky kind a gamer of the pen, paper, dice, and hacking variety a reader of all sorts of books. I guess that makes me... bookish a hoopy frood a geek  I am not: a nerd a jock a goth an amalgamation of any of those three a reader of fine romantic novels a gamer of the X-Box variety *hiss* some other things. There's a lot, and most are boring.  At the moment, school is threatening to crush the life out of me. Thankfully, it's coming to a close, nearly. The end of the third quarter is coming up, and so is Spring Break! Woo woo! Spring Break! Party hardy! Not really. I'll prolly just curl up, rest, play Achaea and some PS2, and sling some dice.  More later.  -Dice Squirrel The Finest Squirrel EVER  EDIT: Err...I'm screwing around with the html for this place, so don't pay any mind to your computer exploding. That's normal. It's hip. Dig?
