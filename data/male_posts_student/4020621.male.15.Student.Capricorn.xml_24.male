My heart bled when u told me “I’m sorry,”  That we were incompatible just that I wasn’t wary  I had to agree to end this feeling, But my heart protested by all its bleeding. I need your love to keep me breathing, Without your love I dun feel like a living…  I want to know why, u wanted to leave so abruptly, Decided to follow up behind ur steps secretly.. There…I saw you giving your heart away, And crushed my heart along the way.  As time passes, the heart is healed.. But scars remain hard to conceal. Kisses n hugs can only be reviewed, By the memories that’s left so few.
