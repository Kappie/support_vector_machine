The fun times you've had in Highschool with all of your friends and the fun (and sometimes dumb)things we all did should not be overshadowed or void because of the negative things that have happened. Learn and grow from both of them but take with you hope and the love of your friends.(i didnt mean to delete this i was just randomly clicking stuff, KAllama) 10:57 Pm  What if Im not sure I can choose hope anymore? What if i have hit the point where the only thing that keeps me going is my faith in christ? He is the only one i still hold any faith or hope in, all else seems more and more pointless everyday. The past few days as I have thought of where ive been and where im going, i can not see any hope in either. I guess the real question i ask u is: What if i just want to take the easy road out of all of this?
