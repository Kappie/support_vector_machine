Truly inspiring…    The Old Man     Once, long ago, in long gone days, There lived an old man of olden ways.  The old man living in a mountain cave, Was extremely wise and philosophically grave.  From far and near people sought his advice, And the old man was established- a sage, very wise.  Then upon one day, a young man, proud; Pondered at the old man, amidst the seeking crowd.  “I’ll prove him wrong!” the young man decided, Down the hill, into the forest, he ran excited.  His first glimpse caught a butterfly, delicate And he thought, looking at the creature small yet great…  “I’ll ask the old man, if it’s dead or living, And wait for the sage’s answering.  “If he answers, “alive it is” I‘ll carefully crush it to bits!  ““It is dead” shall he utter, I’ll release it and let it flutter!”  With this ingenious plan to make the old man falter, The young man rushed, butterfly in hand, to the rock shelter…  “Is it alive?”, he asked the old man carefully, The wise sage, however, didn’t answer immediately.  The impatient young man, waited with a frown, As the old man summed him from up to down.  The old man then spoke, with a smile benign, “It is in your hands, son… Not mine…”     Tejas
