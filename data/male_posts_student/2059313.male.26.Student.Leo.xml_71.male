I'm talking about an even cooler person than that... and I'm sure much more friendly, and a hundred times kinder than anyone else you or I know.  I used to get to hang out with this person all the time.  But due to a lot of things, that's been a big hole in my life that no one else could fill.  That person would be my best friend in the world.  I'm so lucky to know her.  She genuinely brightens my day anytime I'm around her, whether she realizes it or not.  She has a huge heart, and I'm just grateful that she has made a little corner in it for me.  This corner is warm and welcoming. Thanks for the home, friend.
