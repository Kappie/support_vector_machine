A few moments before I collaspe, I thought to myself that she'd definately not reply, then I actually sent one more message, stating that I could not ride my bike as fatigue had set in, and I'm afraid of having an accident(which is a lie). Little did I know that she had intended to reply to my message earlier, then the last message I'd sent her changed her mind. I knew of this through friend C and T, who helped me without even asking for my opinion. I'm feeling very depressed now. How could I have no faith in her? I should've waited for her message, even if she never intended to reply. Damn it!  I'm depressed because of another reason. I've gotten a C5 for my mother tongue 'o' levels. Crap, should've studied that time...  The past week was my english oral exams, which I went through unscathed, thankfully, except for a few hiccups here and there. What upsets me was that the examiners who were, I thought, lenient with me, was actually sarcarstic towards her the day before. We'd the same examiners, a malay lady and a very cool Scottish, but our exam was on different days. She had it a day before mine. Apparently, the malay lady made pretty sarcarstic remarks about the girl I love. I only got to know this after my exams, if not, I'd have flunked.  The evening after her orals, we chatted briefly online. She said that she could not pass her orals with flying colours, which upsets me as I asked friend C to send her tips the day before. This meant that I had not helped her in any ways. I started consoling her, telling her that she'll do fine. I could not sleep that night even though the next day was my orals. I hit the sack at 11.30pm, but could only sleep at 1.30am. I could not sleep because I was thinking of her, and blaming myself for everything that happened.  Currently, I'm still pretty far from her. I'm actually afraid of her now, I don't even dare to message her last night. I'm afraid of being ignored by her once again. I'm also afraid to face her as I feel that I've dissappointed her twice. 1st was... I've forgotten the 1st case... but the 2nd was when I collasped while waiting for her. I didn't keep to my promise. Now, I feel like I'm a hypocrite myself. She's like an angel, with a halo hovering over her head. She's so near, yet so far away from me...  How I wished I have amnesia, where I could forget everything and start all over again. What I'm afraid of is that I may fall in love with her all over again. How could I resist an angel???
