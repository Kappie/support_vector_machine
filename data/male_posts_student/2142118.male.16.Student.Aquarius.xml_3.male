His own Word.  Spiritual nudges from the Holy Spirit.  the good times.  we can take a lesson from anything and everything that happens to us...  God wants to improve us.  He wants the best for us.  He wants to teach us things we can apply to our lives that will improve us and be useful to us in making our lives better.  i've learned so much in the past two months...
