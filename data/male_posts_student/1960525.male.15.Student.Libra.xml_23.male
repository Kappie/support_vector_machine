I mean, yeah, it's gonna be great that we don't have school or gorilla or homework for a while, but... you always lose touch with people over the summer, you know? Like, those you don't ever have any contact with when you're not in that class with them.  Since it seems to be human nature to not go outside anymore, and since noone lives close to eachother, you can't go and do stuff, unless you plan it over the internet or aim.  Of course, it's also doubtful I'll be able to see any of my friends who happen to be girls over the summer, because I've noticed the bulk of Irving's population's behavior, which entails thinking that everything you say is implying something, then taking that something and stretching it WAY out of proportion, nothing works. You can't say "hey, _______, wanna go see troy?" because everyone would just think you were going on a date, even if you weren't**, and the whole thing would be ruined.  Sure, there's AIM, and I'm grateful for that, but I get tired of reading text sometimes. Even though in truth you're talking to another person, sometimes you just need a voice to hear, so you know... you feel less alone.  I guess I've talked about all I need to for tonight, I hope I can find somewhere to go, or something to do, because I really need it right now.  **especially not with me, if you take one look at me in school or something, you'll probably figure I'm not the kind of guy who gets to go on many dates...
