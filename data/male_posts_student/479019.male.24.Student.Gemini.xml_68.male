I doubt I'll ever be fat, my metabolism and build will keep me from that; however, I need to keep an eye on my health. I really think that I should be lifting so that weight gain is in the form of muscle and not fat. Tomorrow I promise!  Concerning my productivity today... I've managed to get a lot of quotes into the javascript files for the page. That means on even months there won't be undefined quotes and images (unless I missed something). Basically I just need to look up like 4 more quotes to put into the odd month javascript file to have both odd and even months done. I feel kind of bad in that the "dead white guy" quotes greatly outnumber quotations from women and minorities. Damn society!  Song playing at the moment is "Fox" by  Millencolin  from their  Pennybridge Pioneers  CD (2000).  ***
