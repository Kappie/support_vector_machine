I know that politics is a dirty game, but it has seemingly gotten dirtier. It was just a few weeks ago that Vice President Cheney told a distinguished member of the Senate to “go fuck yourself”, and then refused to apologize for it, in fact he told reporters that he “felt better” after he did it. This Administration is getting the corner on macho, and their Marlboro Man appeal seems to have been deeply entrenched in their strategy, and if that is how they want to play that is fine, but it is inappropriate to then criticize the vulgarity of the comedians and performers at Kerry’s rally.  If you are going to be mean and that is how you want to portray yourself to the American people, the least you can do is not be a hypocrite.
