It’s a really great site.  Anyways, today has been a very productive day for me as far as things related to computing.  I did a lot of work on my site.  I got most of the pages up with some content instead of ‘I’m working on this” messages.  It feels good to be able to click on any link and actually see something.  As weird as that sounds, it’s true.  I think I’ll work more tomorrow on getting old stuff converted to the new design.  I didn’t get everything converted yet and I should have probably done that first thing, but I never thought about it.  I got my first person to buy prints of mine.  It happened to be my mom, but nonetheless, I have a buyer!  Yay.  I have a total of two dollars and forty-six cents pure profit.  Woo yeah.  I’m not counting the cost of my print account, because technically that was a birthday gift.  So that’s awesome.  Had football practice this early morning.  It wasn’t as bad as I predicted.  I think that the coaches thought it over and decided to go easy on us.  We’ll be ready for the game, I know it.  We know it.  We’re going to win.  We are going to win.  Enough said.  It’s pretty early now.  I should have gone to be a long time ago, so I guess I’ll go now!  Night.
