All of the walking i have been doing, which is generally solitary, has given me a lot of time for reflection, musing and meditation. It reminds me of the days i used to run a lot. When i was running i would forget everything but my breath and the fall of my foot, afterwards my mind would seem clearer and i would feel as though i hade tidied around my brain a little bit. I think that is what is happening to me now. I am sure the sunshine, fresh air, and excercise are contributing something too:especially after a winter in MN. I can truly believe that spring is here because i hear the birds now when i am walking(even on the most car adapted stretch of washington). I never hear them in winter, but once a certain amount of daylight is present each day they break out in song and i missed it during the winter.  I am longing to garden, just like i do each spring, and i really am going to have to see what mum and jannie are planning to do with the garden. I will lobby for chard and carrots again. They did so well last year and we eat as much as can be grown. Lettuce maybe? Beans, peas, tomatos. Oh well I am probably getting a little ahead of myself. Someday, though, i will have a garden of my own.
