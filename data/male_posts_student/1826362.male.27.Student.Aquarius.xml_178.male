No! it was due to the fact that in 4 and a half years of using this computer, I never dusted out the inside of it.  There was a lot of stuff in there, I'm surprised the thing worked at all.  Now if I can just figure out what is making it turn itself on in the middle of the night and make lots of sounds, I'll be ok.  The friendly usenet people seem to think it's a faulty power supply.  Lauren seems to think it's haunted.  A new power supply runs around 20 bucks, anyone know how much for an exorcism?
