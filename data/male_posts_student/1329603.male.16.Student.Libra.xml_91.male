Where some people are ecstatic, I'm actually really depressed, tired, I've got a headache, my head hurts, I'm worried, and.... *cries* I'm not feeling too great at the moment. In no way am I pleased with myself.  I've spent the majority of this evening and tonight thinking about what people would say about me if I died, how many people would be at my funeral etc. I don't like it. I don't like the idea of me dying, I don't like the idea of the things left unsaid being said and hurting more than they should, and I definitely don't like the idea of the things that wouldn't hurt almost killing. I'm not keen.  Everything's just pissing me off tonight. Gwen was singing while she came up the stairs, to which I shouted at her "SHUT UP!" and scared her, Pete asked me if he could borrow Chess and kept asking me why I'd said no so I told HIM to shut up... I'm not feeling very good about anything right now.  And I think explaining how I feel would make some peoples' lives quite complicated. The situation being complicated ANYWAY. For crying out loud.... why is everything I do always ridiculously complicated?
