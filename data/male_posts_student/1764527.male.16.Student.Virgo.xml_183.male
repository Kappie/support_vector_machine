Besides, high school girls rarely know how to pick the 'good' guys. They'll come to their senses later in life. And, when you make it big and are really successful and have all the women fighting for your glance then all the ones from high school are gonna feel really stupid"? Did I mention that that annoys the fuck out of me? Off me some damned good advice, not wishes for the future.
