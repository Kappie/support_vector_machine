I mean in the first one it basically drags on for two hours how Harry is so great for surviving a magic attack. First of all, how does an f***ing baby defeat a supreme dark lord of magic that was able to defeat Harry's parents, which were supposedly really powerful. I mean, it just doesn't make any sense at all. Then in the second movie there is Dobby. Basically Dobby is a complete rip off of Gollum from a much better series called Lord of the Rings. Except, Dobby whines a lot more than Gollum which I thought to be impossible, and Dobby is basically Harry's bitch. Then, at the end, a f***ing bird that weighs no more than 10 ounces carries a f***ing hat that Harry can pull an f***ing 9 pound sword out of. I mean, it is like when you see a tiny little clown car, and 20 full-grown men in makeup come out of it. Now, supposedly in the third movie, a dark wizard named Serious Black escapes from a prison. First of all, what kind of name is Serious Black for a f***ing dark lord. I mean come on, Serious Black, it sounds like it could be the "next" Power Ranger. Then you have the fact that the only people who can supposedly stop Serious are these weird creature/demons called Dementors. First, how does Serious escape from the Dementors in the first place. Once again, makes no sense. Personally, I think Rowling was just running out of ideas for books, but she really wanted the money. Then there is the fact that these "Dementors" have a very uncanny resemblance to the Nazgul of the Lord of the Rings. Furthermore proving the Rowling sucks as a writer and has made fortunes by copying and slightly modifing ideas from Tolkien. She is almost like a "Jewel" brand of soda over a real soda like Coca-Cola which is obviously much better. So, that is my overall summary and opinion of one of the worst stories ever. Sure, I may get lots of hate emails telling me that they are going to come and find me and cast magic spells on me, but when I receive those, I will laugh at how pathetically sad they truly are.  later, bradleyJ
