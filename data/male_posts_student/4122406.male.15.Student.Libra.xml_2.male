This is its description of itself:   "The Last Alliance is an online resource centre and meeting point for players of Games Workshop's Lord of the Rings battle game. Run by gamers for gamers, it is our mission to make it easier than ever for the community to share their knowledge, experience and tips with other players. "   Yes, I play those 'Warhammer' games. Though technically,   urlLink Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game s  is nothing like Warhammer. The gameplay itself is based upon the Warhammer gameplay, but everything else is different. For those that have no idea of what I'm going on about, this is a brief overview. You buy little models, metal and plastic, about an inch high, paint them and then, using various rules, you battle with them.  I started playing it when a magazine called  urlLink Battle Games in Middle Earth  came out. This is the same models/game as the  urlLink GamesWorkshop  one, but just made it available to a wider area of the population.  I now have over 200 miniatures, and have spent around 200-250 pounds. Take a look at the various links to see what they are like.  When my site is done, I will have my own pictures on it.  This is just one that I have painted:   It is a facinating hobby, but one that is looked upon as geekish and pathetic by popular people. You get a whole lot of flak if you don't do what 'normal' people do, but you learn to live with it.
