The Dead Sea Scrolls were so boring, there was no translation available, and it just was... pointless.  Some dirty pieces of paper under some dim strobing lights-- those dirty pieces of paper are so ridiculously pointless.  I'm sorry to say that to all the religious nuts-- but think of all the people suffering around the world, then thinking of all the money going into preserving and showcasing that nonsense.  Even if that money went to giving 3 people fresh water it would be worth the loss.  So my 2 cents again- but it's my weblog :)
