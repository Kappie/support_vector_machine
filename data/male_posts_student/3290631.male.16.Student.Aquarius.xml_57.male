Afterwards, Dan and I went to his house to paint his mother's bedroom.  We got $25 dollars a piece, which was very nice.  After that we got a ride over to the Riverdale Metro-North station and took the train up to Hastings to meet Kyle, Britty, and Becky to go see Fahrenheit 9/11.  The documentary was very good, most of all, it was touching.  I got teary-eyed during this part of the movie where the mother of a soldier, who died in Iraq, was reading his last letter to her.  It's hard watching a documentary by Michael Moore--sometimes you want to laugh, but then immediately afterwards you want to cry.  Afterwards, Kyle left us and we went to Britty's for some food.  Then Rachel came down.  We had a good time chillin in the basement.  It was a good time.  I'm gonna miss Rachel tons during these two months.  :(  I'm gonna write Rachel and Stephanie while they're at camp though.  In lighter news, I got a 100 on my global history regents and an 89 on my chemistry regents.  I'm extremely proud of my history score but slightly disappointed with my chemistry score.  I'm gonna start getting some real work done on my short story.  Either today, or tomorrow, or both days, I'm going to be mapping out my protagonist--his history, his future, his emotions, his reactions, the works.  It will make him more tangible in the story, and more realistic in my own mind.  After I do that I'm gonna take a good hard look on what style of writing I want to use in this story, what themes I want to convey, and also intricately mapping out my plot.  Once all that is done, I'm going to write.  I might end up scrapping the first two pages I wrote during the Spring if they don't fit in with the direction I head in.  I'm looking forward to all that.  That's all for now.  My next entry will be about the film, Elephant.
