So to sum up the day, I got a haircut, went to Barnes and Noble to buy Pendragon, had gymnastics, and lost my Barnes and Noble gift card. (I figure I dropped it walking out of the store)  But today was good. Nana was able to come by and watch Riley so I didn't have to do it. It was a relief for once. We got Burger King around lunch time. Reid HAD to have chicken nuggets from there even though I wanted Wendy's. He always gets his way and now I sound like a brat. I came back and went in the pool. Actually, I floated around the pool in a tube. I didn't feel like going in. It was cold from all the rain so I drifted around and got a good tan.  Before that I made some corrections on my history report (Thank you mom!) and was able to read 3 chapters in "The Good Earth." It took me the same amount of time to read 1 chapter in Jane Eyre. This book will probably be much better. Speaking of books, I stayed up pretty late last night reading Pendragon. It's the only time I can get. In the daytime, I make myself read books for school.  So I had gymnastics tonight at 5 and got out at 7. I came home and watched Big Brother 5. Did I mention how much I love that show and how I want to be on it when I turn 21? Well I do. We went over to Kohls afterwards at 9:00 at night. Mom had a 10 dollar off coupon and had to use it before it got too late and I needed to get a new watch. So, we ran out with Riley and Rachel (Dad, Reid, and his friend John went over to my Uncle John's to see his boat) I picked out a nice new watch. And the best part about it is the blue light. Yes the shiny shiny blue light that glows in the dark is great!
