I can stand near my window at night and just listen to the sounds that come from the darkened field.    I stare at the moon and the stars hidden behind my big tree.    It’s at night when my thinking becomes clearer but it’s also when everyone goes to sleep so I end up being alone.    It’s okay though because I like to be left alone.    Sometimes I crave companionship but other nights I just like it when I’m by my self.    I don’t know, maybe I’m just weird.
