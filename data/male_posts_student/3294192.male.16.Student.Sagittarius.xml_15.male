School is supposed to be over, as I took the last of my final exams on Friday in the horrible heat. Sadly, this is not exactly true for me. I managed to fail Health 10, so I must take 6 days of summer school. The worst part just may be standing in line to register. Hopefully, the 6 days I'm assigned won't intersect too horribly with my film course, although they most likely will. That's a real bummer, and I feel like an ass for getting myself into such a crappy position.  After my final final on Friday, I walked home with Matt and we played video games for many hours. It felt really good to get back in touch with him, since nobody else will play with me and my toys. I was able to vent a bit of my frustration with my Xbox though, by explaining to him how impossible it has turned out to be to modify it. Later in the afternoon I went over to Jon's where I met up with the usual suspects plus the members of At Any Cost, who would be playing a show with us later that evening.   What a show it was.   At Any Cost played an awesome set filled with their usual un-tethered enthusiasm and rowdiness.  urlLink We  followed right after them, playing one of our literally hottest shows ever.  urlLink Off went the shirts . I think we played our set really well, except for a few technical difficulties we had during the first two songs. At the show I got to chill a bit with Sarah from Milburn who is just the nicest girl. Afterwards, Chris drove Jon, Guy, Kate and I to Taco Bell for some awesome 1/2 lb. Bean Burrito Especials, and some oh-so pleasant dinner conversations. I got home at some awful hour and went straight to bed, ignoring the mess of wires, plastic and solder on my desk that had at one point been an Xbox controller.  I woke up this morning at a lazy time, and got some messages from Guy saying that a band had dropped out and that we had been asked to play the show tonight. I thought it was a good idea and so did the rest of KP, so we decided that we would eventually meet up and get our shit together. Just before I left though, I talked to a new acquaintance of mine, who told me he'd be able to help me with my Xbox modification. As KP coagulated at the Baird Center it donned on me how much I love playing in the heat. After a bit of fretting over the PA system, we were able to relax a bit and hang with the wonderful  urlLink Notrock ers who dropped by.   Hunger lead to a pick-up order from Pirate Pizza which lead to some nice conversations with Adam and Liz at a red checkered table. Adam is really a wonderful person, and I wish everybody could meet him. I don't mean to inflate him though, he's just really charmingly unblemished by negative characteristics. I told him about my plans.   Goldy and I have decided we'd like to work together to produce a comic and a CD, that are to be experienced together. One would read the comic which contains several small stories, and each of these stories would have an assigned track on the accompanying CD. We haven't decided on the music though. It might be an awesome mix or something home-brewed. I think the combo should be titled Aural [heart] Visual.   We were motivated to play an extra-special and efficiently paced 10-minute set, which involved me getting shocked I think a bit too badly, by an odd acting instrument cable connected to my charged amplifier. As soon as we left the stage  urlLink Khantra  began their explosive act and got me to dance. They're one of the very few bands that can do that, and I really appreciated it.  Following the deconstruction of the show, Mr. Danger Takahashi was kind enough to take Allie, Logan, Kate, Jon, Guy and I out to a late night dinner at IHOP, where I drank possibly 3 too many strawberry iced teas. The ride home was filled with merriment and lots of pen-on-Jono action. Good times with good people.  As I got home tonight I talked to my acquaintance again, who was surprisingly helpful and patient in helping me get the illegal files I needed and setting up my machine. Pretty son thanks to him I will be basking in the glow of an Xbox fitted out with a running  urlLink EvoX  dashboard.  Those were my days.
