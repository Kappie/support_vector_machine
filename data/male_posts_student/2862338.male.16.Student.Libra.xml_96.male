No, not that kind of dream, it was actually quite innocent, and made me remmebr the fact we never said goodbye to each other :o(  Well, hopefully she's doing good where ever she is.  It sucked though, cause from  6 to 7 i felt really bad.  1.5) Caroline calls to tell me she isn't going to go to the city because of the weather, something i completely forgot about.  Turns out today acutally wasn't that bad, but we made plans for another day  2) Went to school after a breakfast that consisted of about 6 Strawberries. And had my contacts on for the first time at summer school too.  What was ironic was, that today i felt more awake then anyother time. Prolly cause i was still alittle excited that there still my be a chance to go to the City.  Side note on the city: I fucking love it...don't like it, love it. As i told every other person, i used to hate it...with a passion.  You see, like, almost all the family freinds live in the city.  Theres gotta be like 4 in every borough, it's ridiculous...anyway, long story short, we used to go pretty much every weekend, and i fucking hated it.  But the older u get, the more u appreciate, and now i can;t get enough.  I just typed all of that up to show a point that it sucked that i didn't go to the city today...that is all....go eat some gerber baby food, so babies can eat your souls.   3) got home, and went drving for awhile. Saw jorge, tunred around, swung by the arcadian, then came all the way back around to go pick up a job application in Croton. Got back, and my lil' brother was bitching about food, so i drove back down to the arcadian for some subway.  saw jorge, said whats up, then drove back...well, more like slowly tired to, cause my engine was fucked up.  You see, i turned on the AC for just alittle over 3 seconds, and my engine just says "fuck you....no..no, i don't want to hear it, fuck you"...so i BARELY got home, and when i did, it smelled like severely bruned *insert random noun here*.  So yeah  4)then went driving after like 2 -3 hours of doing nothing but think about what i COULD have done today.  We orderd Pizza, and i got to drive...yay!....came back home, ate like, literally 5-6 slices, and now i'm here, feeling severly fat.  So yah, there u have it, minus acouple little details, nothing importnat though.  It's about 7:44 right now...i m prolly going to head to the gym soon, cause i really do feel extremely fat right now. I'll head out as soon as my dad is finished checking the car...  I've rediscoverd my playing ability now that mike let me borrow his Metal Master.  I've been shredding that thing like there's no tomarrrow. It's awsome  Told my parents about the i-pod...weren't as pissed as i thought they'd be...but still, i felt like an fucking asshole  Been DLing High Fedelity.  Everyone loves it, and back when i saw it, i thought i was the only one that even heard of it!, let alone like it.  lol, no matter, i must own a copy...and yes, the illegal way will suffice for now.  I realized, time in general sucks major parrot cock.  It does.  Like, i never go by time, but i'm always around some kind of time-telling mechanism.  i can't escape it!!  been going through my music library, i realized i have a shit load of love songs in there.  Just noticing (see entry below)  Speaking of below, u prolly noticed the "roaches" pic.  Ya, thats the krew.  I spent a good amount of time making it, just to realize it looks like shit at the end.  W/e...it's easy to see Jones' came out the best, with mine second.  The pics weren't exaclty perfect, and it just turns out i have more of me and jones than of everyone else.  No matter, it's ok i guess.    Still have an urge to go to the city. But as stated above, tomarrow will have to be the day.  I wanna check out some tattoo prices, and just walk around...it's good to just go out with freinds and forget about life for a while.   Download Jimmy Soul - If You Want To Be Happy...trust me...you know this song, it's it's fucking awsome.  i'm sure your wondering what the title is about...well, i've been bitchin about time lately.  Like, i think it was today or yesteray 9see, there it goes again!) like, this whole thing just hit me. Like, wtf, literaly, wtf is going on. It fucking blew my mind.  Life was so simple back in the day. Nothin to worry about, but now look at us all, were all working, running around EVERYwhere with are cars, g/f, more freinds than we ever though posible....omg...it's lol, its' so fucking crazy.  If you told me 3 years ago that this would all be happening, i would have laughed in your face so hard...  ok, i'm tired, which means i should go to the gym now. I'm sorry, but i care to much in the way that i look.  Maybe its case i used to get teased alot...long story...want to hear it? call me...i'll be back in an hour or so  Doing everything you dreamed of -steve
