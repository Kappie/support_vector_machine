The news comes from a believeable source who posted a thread on the  urlLink Zeropaid  forums.  Appareantly, the hacker group ran into some trouble about copyright infringement, ironically, but that's not gonna stop them. Be advised, the current version MAY stop working, since the version of KaZaA it is built on (core 2.0.2) is pretty old (new is core 2.6).  If Sharman Networks hasn't banned it, it'll keep working, and that like is uselful. Someone, or well, a couple of people, are working one builing a new spyware free version of KaZaA based upon 2.6, but its not really ready, or all that great yet. For a good alternative, try  urlLink eMule  or see the full post  urlLink here.  Zeropaid itself is a good p2p portal, you might find some useful stuff there. If anything, ask me.  A few things looking up now, Ozzy's getting better, mostly. He can breathe without the aid of a respirator and, well...I think that's about it! The Fallout license MIGHT go to the old members of Black Isle Studios, AND Fallout: BoS, the BAD Fallout, is getting BAD reviews! Just goes to show you, they'll get theirs!  I'm Deadinside, and I burn with vengance...kinda...more like...a sizzle.  "Umm...I just wanna be friends...." "Ok, I'll be your friend...if you'll be my piece of ass"
