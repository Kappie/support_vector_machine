Where do you think that Nissan was made?  Ohio?  How about the gas from 7-11?  Chances are that itâ€™s from Citgo, a Venezuelan company.  How can this person stand to be such a hypocrite?  Now, I realize that it would be nearly impossible to buy  all  American made products.  The clothes I wear from AE and Hollister are made mostly in Mexico, Egypt, Pakistan, and Vietnam.  It would be nice though, if all Americans would stop and think about where some of the more major products they buy come from.   Think how much money is lost to our economy every time someone fills up at a 7-11.  Or how many American workers lose their jobs every time someone buys a Nissan or Hyundai.     Contrary to popular belief...Honda Civics are not made in China or Japan, they are  all  made in Marysville, Ohio.   urlLink  Please check out this page for a list of American and foreign owned companies...     urlLink  THIS LIST IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT...WHERE THE GASOLINE AMERICAN COMPANIES BUY ACTUALLY COMES FROM
