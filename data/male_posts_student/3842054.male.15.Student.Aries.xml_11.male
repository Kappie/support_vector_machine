I got on the Tri- Rail @ 8 am like a normal school day (it was a trip  down memory lane) I saw simon, but we did not aknowledge each other...  too bad, so sad. Brittneys mom picked us up, and i spent twelve  wonderful hours at her house. We played DDR, Crash Bandicoot. Listened  to Music, watched T.V., and of course, ate. Our little rondevous at  publix ended with me almost crashing her moms cart all over teh ground.  "I just busted in my pants Brittney" Ha.   So i went to Brittneys to see some Shakespeare play with her, and when  we got there it was all good. We ate a bunch of KFC chicken, biscuits,  coleslaw, mashed potatoes, and mac n cheese, and as we were preparing  to watch the play, my worst fear struck upon us, Lightning. I had to  leave as that is the one thing i am very afraid of in life, Natural  Disasters. So i forced her to come to the car with me where i proceded  to sit in the back seat and not look out the window so i would not have  to face those bolts of terror. THen the play was canceled and i was off  to my grandfathers to spend the night.   My grandpa is very rich and lives in somewhat of a mansion. Its worth  about a million dollars, and i benefit from it only when i visit there  and enjoy what it has to offer. Pool and spa (we'll get to taht later),  huge yard, big house, including my grandpas office/extra bedroom which  is a second story on top of the garage. It is a seperate house, and  that is where i stay when i go there. So i show up at my grandpas  and no one is home, my brother has been there the past week for a camp  that is in Jupiter. So i wait there expecting them home, and hour later  they show up, thank God i found the key that lets me in the house or i  would be stuck outside. So it was just any normal night. I couldnt get  on the computer (passworded) or i would have posted then, but i couldnt.    That was Thursday.    Friday, July 16th   I woke up to my grandpa typing and talking away in teh office portion  of hte guest house/bachelor pad thing. I pretended to sleep for like  ten more minutes, but gave up and just arose. Went down to see my  brother and cousin preparing for camp. No coffee cooking, i was  disapointed, i was in the mood for some coffee but i wasnt about to  ask. There were donut holes though, which i devoured half the  box, and little muffins. Then i watched tv and read the paper as  my grandpa brought the kids to camp. When he came home i asked him if  he could give me some work to do so i could make some money. He asks me  to clean the windows. Easy enough. Except my grandpas humongous house  has see through bay doors, and like 200 windows. and one thing about my  grandpa. He is anal retentive, and a perfectionist. So i had to do it  perfect lest i risk having to do it ALL over again. Two and a half  hours later, I was thirty dollars richer and my grandpa was praising me  on what a good job i did. Now, i spend enough of my day watching  VH1 and ESPN that i could risk doing something productive and  benefiting from it again. So i asked him for more work, getting paid 10  dollars and hour, and he told me to wash his beloved Ford Explorer.  Big, big car. And he has all the right materials. So that was simple  since i had cleaned a bunch of cars in my day, and now i had ten more  dollars plus a tip to equal 50 dollars!!! not a bad payment for only 4  hours work.   Then the bad part of hte day happened. I went swimming. In the  pool i thought it would be cool and relaxing to go under and swim  around under the surface. So i close my eyes, dive under, lose track of  where I am, and boom, hit the bottom, my face is SCREWED UP! My first  reaction is " MY TEETH, ARE MY TEETH OK" My teeth that are worth a net  amount of about $1,500 + . But my teeth were ok, it was my face that  was messed up. I feel under my lip and theres not blood,and i wonder  how i could have made it out of that without a scratch. Oh gosh  bobby... I get out and go into the outside bathroom, look in the mirror  and it was like something our of a horror movie. Blood is dripped all  down my face adn its everywhere, i pick up a towel and wipe it off,  ruined towel. I jump back in the water to clean it up. No help, i hold  pressue to it with a towel and go inside to explain to my grandparetns.  Two huge scrapes on my nose, a scrape on my upper lip, and on my chin.  Neosporin, band-aids, i feel fine, but now i look like a sufferer of  lepercy.   My mom came to pick us up, and when i get home, i eat and ZONK OUT (  Zonk means to fall asleep) I sleep for 4 1/2 hours missing the marlins  game, and i love the 90's but i wake up in time to take a shower and  watch the best week ever. Thank god for reruns on ILT90's.    It is now 3:00 in the after noon saturday. I'll post again tonight to talk about today.    LFO  "Summer Girls"   Yeah...I like it when the girls stop by..

I can not even give you an  analysis on this song. the message is so deep that if anyoneone other  than LFO ever EVER uncoded its true intentions, God would come down and  kill us all by sending evil ostriches that shoot fire and shit out  twinkies filled with apple sause rather than creme. LFO = Lyrics Fuckin  Owesome (the O is there instead of the A on purpose, its all a part of  the creative eccentricness that is LFO.)
