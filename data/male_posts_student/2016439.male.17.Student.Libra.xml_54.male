The times I say it are few and far between, and usually when I do say it it isn't because I mean, "I'm sorry." It's usually when someone's having a bad day or when something happens to someone or something close to someone close to me.  What do I say?  "I'm sorry."  But the times when it  really  counts, when I really  should   say that I'm sorry, I'm unresponsive.  There have been way too many times that I haven't said I'm sorry for things I've said and/or done, especially to my mother.  I could write a book with all of the unsaid I'm sorry's, and maybe that would be enough to make her feel more valued and appreciated than she is now.  Two words than can, for some people, mean the difference between life and death.  How many times do I say, "Thank you"?  Again, I say it in passing to someone who congratulates me or helps me pick up my stuff when I drop it in the hallway, but hardly when I actually want to say it.  If I had my way, I'd say "Thank you" everytime I wake up and see my parents getting ready for work or when I see that my friends made it safely to school or when someone picks me up from the deepest of depressions or when I simply see people working to help me get to where I want to go.   You know, there are few things in this world that are worse than having one of your own family members tell you that they don't feel appreciated or like they matter simply because no one ever tells them.  That was a wake-up call for me.  I want to try now, I want to make a conscious effort to say "I'm sorry" for the things I'm sorry for, and "Thank you" for those for which I am thankful.  Two phrases, four words, five syllables, a million and one reasons why I should say them.
