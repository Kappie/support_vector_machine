    
       all along the road less traveled, i have crawled and i have run.  i have wandered through the winds and rains until i found the sun.  the watching eyes asked me why i walk this narrow way.  there may never be a reason for the hope i have today but... i am blessed.  from when i rise up in the morning until i lay my head to rest.  i feel you near me.  you soothe me when i'm weary.  for all the worst and all the best... i am blessed.
