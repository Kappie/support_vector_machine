The night was good. Lots of fun lots of drink.  Spoke about the unspeakable again... I just hate the situation. Well no recent news which is good just carying on with the work.  Larry-o-key was quite fun. Spoke with lots of people. Masacred a couple of songs.... Showed my blog to more people.... I just haveto carry on working as all I have done is gone down the pub for lunch.
