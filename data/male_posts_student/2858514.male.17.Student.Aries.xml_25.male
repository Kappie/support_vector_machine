The major problem of learning to program is not the language itself, but the technologies needed to learn in order to write useful programs. For example, just XML consists of plenty of technologies, such as XSLT, XML Schema, XQuery, XPath... These names make me feel dizzy. And it is not very possible to learn them all since they expand as time goes by.  However, the truth is as a programmer, you need to know the major computer technologies to be competitive. So, treating programming as a hobby is good. Treating it as a job is not as good as many people think.
