He claims to be tolerant and mindful of equality for all, but it just doesn't jibe with the evidence.  The man has shown no tolerance towards homosexuals.  He has done this through simple inaction and a refusal to even acknowledge their existence.  He refuses to even mention the terms "gay," "lesbian," and "homosexual."  The President ignores them and treats them as though they don't exist.  How can you truly care about a person's rights and equality if you don't acknowledge them?  But this issue is only one of a larger problem that has arisen since the beginning of the Bush candidacy in 1999.  With President Bush's election came the ascension of the Religious Right.  The Religious Right has always been a part of the Republican Party ever since the late-1970s.  President Reagan's election helped establish them as a prominent wing within the party, although they were not one of the dominant wings.  The wing became dominant with the 1994 congressional elections and the retaking of Congress by the Republicans.  The rallying organization at the time was the Pat Robertson brainchild known as the Christian Coalition, then headed by Ralph Reed.  At the same time several leaders of the Religious Right published books, including   urlLink Our Hopes, Our Dreams: A Vision for America   by Gary Bauer,   urlLink Steeling the Mind of America  (a collection of essays by prominent members of the religious right), and Ralph Reed's own book   urlLink Contract With the American Family: A Bold Plan  .  This was the high point of the Religious Right's influence.  They were  the  influence in the Republican Party and one could not even dream of being elected without their approval.  But the 1996 reelection of President Clinton saw the slow decline in the Religious Right's influence.  They hurled everything they had against President Clinton, the one person they saw as the leading example of America's moral decay, and they lost.  It was a big blow to them, but it would not prove to be the last.  The largest blow came in the disastrous results of the 1998 congressional elections, which saw a major shift against the Republicans in congress despite forecasts to the contrary.  This resulted in the resignation of the champion of the Republican cause, Newt Gingrich.  With this defeat the already weakened Religious Right shrunk back to the prominence it held when it first entered the political fray in the late-70s.  Despite their decline, they remained in the background.  They were still an influence in the party, but they successfully operated under the proverbial radar.  Many simply ignored them, considering the group defunct and out of the picture.  After much concern I even declared them gone.  We were all wrong.  They never seemed to play a large role in President Bush's campaign, but it has now become apparent that they were operating in the background there.  One should have expected this with President Bush's declared religious beliefs.  Now reports have surfaced of Bible studies being held in the White House on a regular basis, not to mention Attorney General Ashcroft's fundamentalist beliefs and the Bible studies that have accompanied him to the Justice Department.  Then there's the social conservatism that has permeated the Bush Presidency.  It is completely in line with the Religious Right's views.  The best example of this is not only Bush's silence concerning homosexuals and homosexual issues, but his endorsement of the Federal Marriage Amendment.  The Federal Marriage Amendment would codify, in the Constitution, that marriage shall only be between a man and a woman.  At least, that is what has been claimed by its advocates.  In actuality it is much more.  The FMA actually states, "Neither this Constitution, nor the Constitution of any State or Federal law, shall be construed to require that marital status or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon unmarried couples or groups."  Supposedly President Bush and other supporters of the FMA believe civil unions and other contracts are perfectly fine, and that only the institution of marriage should be reserved for men and women.  If this is so, however, then why outlaw "legal incidents thereof?"  The current language would make not only gay marriage illegal, but civil unions and all other contracts between homosexual couples as well.  This betrays the true beliefs of the FMA's supporters, as well as President Bush's.  Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas recently wrote in the   urlLink National Review Online  , "If the movement for civil unions and same-sex marriage succeeds, we may well be dealing a fatal blow to an already vulnerable institution."  They can claim no more that the only target is gay marriage, but all legal contracts that would give homosexual couples the rights heterosexual couples have.  The FMA has no chance of passing.  There are too many opponents.  But was it always the true intention of the Religious Right, its most ardent supporters, actually to pass such an amendment?  According to its most prominent members, no.  Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council recently said in a   urlLink New York Times   interview, "Social conservatives are looking at this issue so we know who needs to be educated on this issue or removed if that is possible."  The goal was never to win the vote, although that would have been an added bonus.  It was a measure used in the goal to remake the Republican Party into a fundamentalist Christian party.  It is designed to bring about the transformation of the party into something resembling the Constitution, American, and American Heritage parties.  Their conservatism is focused on the social aspect, one that would use the government to enact and enforce what they deem to be the morals of America.  These morals would, of course, be based on their brand of "Christianity."  This will destroy the party.  It will relegate it to third party status.  That is unless a resistance movement can be formed.  It is unclear whether this will be done since this is an election year and many Republicans fear that any deviance would cost them.  Many have already declared their resistance.  The rest can walk a fine line and use the Religious Right, then betray them after the elections.  But the Religious Right is still acting stealthily.  The upcoming Republican Convention is filled with moderates and liberals.  This has been designed by President Bush and his advisor Karl Rove to show the nation of the Republican Party's diversity and the broad support for President Bush.  The Religious Right has already expressed concern over the lack of representation, but this concern has been lukewarm at best.  I'm not unconvinced that this is some sort of ploy on their part; some sort of deception on their part designed to conceal their coming coup d'etat.  The only way of stopping their plans may be the defeat of President Bush.  Unfortunately I don't see that happening.  The worst thing that could happen is a Bush landslide, which is what I feel will happen.  If this is the result come November, it will be interesting to see what happens when the Religious Right declares victory and comes out into the open.  The lines are being drawn, and the resistance is forming.  The Republican Party has some great moderate voices, including Giuliani, Hagel, McCain, and Schwarzenegger.  I only hope that they take a stand and rally their supporters to fight the coming civil war within the party.  If they don't, then the party will be doomed.
