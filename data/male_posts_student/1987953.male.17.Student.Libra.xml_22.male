Final Destination , The Game  and  The Omega Code  are awesome thrillers. Has anyone seen  28 Days Later  and  Abandon ?   Frankly,  28 Days Later  is the dumbest thing I have ever seen in my life. It wasn't scary, tried to seriously defy biology, and was so full of cussing that I couldn't stand it. I bought it from Hollywood Video (yes, BOUGHT not RENTED), but threw it away it was so stupid and annoying. It makes no sense, by the time you get the hang of the idea, you're too far into the storyline, and at the end, it leaves so many questions unanswered and doesn't make sense. It's also not scary! I hated it.    Abandon  was actually pretty good and worth keeping. Overall, one of my favorite actresses is Katie Holmes, who stars in this thriller. (I wasn't happy about hearing that she had a topless scene in  The Gift , but what can you do? I can't change what she'll do for money!) At first, the movie kind of seems like it's a WB show, you know, just a show with a storyline, but at the end it gets really good and shows you how the main character is more than meets the eye: a crazy psychopathic freak. You may be disappointed in the movie at first, but it gets good eventually. There was too much sexuality, but I am able to tune that out and focus on the movie most often, so it was okay. If you can handle the sexuality and not let it change you during the movie, I recommend it. Although I've seen more sexuality in the hallways of my old school, a   Christian   school, so it's not too bad. Overall, good movie.   Now to my question: What are good thrillers and scary movies that you all have seen? I am always coming up short and not getting the best ones. Keep in mind that movies with milder sexuality and less cussing are so much more appreciated. I almost always read a lot of reviews to make sure what I am about to watch is "doctrinally acceptable," but for some reason for these last two movies I just watched them with no regard to what kind of themes they portrayed. I do recommend  Abandon . Whatever you do, do NOT watch  28 Days Later . It's so dumb and the themes are so unethical. I have seriously learned a lesson, and I will be keeping tabs on what I watch a  lot  harder. God has taught me a valuable lesson this time around.  (Also, my other favorite kind of movie is comedy.  Master of Disguise  was awesome. So basically you either need to scare me poopless or make me bust a gut laughing. Sorry to put that so picturesque!)  Anyway, let me know what you think. Comment me! Blog ya later!  In Christ, Mike >
