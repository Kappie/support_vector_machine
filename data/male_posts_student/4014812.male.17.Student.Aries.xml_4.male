Im probably gonna be doing a list clean up soon so that i can delete the people that dont talk... or just the people that are really annoying.     Yep... Just thought id fill this in before i go swimming... cuz i probably wont be back on the computer till tomorrow... So yeah, were going swimming at the Aquatic Center from 6 to 9... anyone who wants to come is more than welcome too :D...     ok off to swimming i go    **EDIT**    w00t.... just got back from swimming... was are fun :D...
