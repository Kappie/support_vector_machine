About how even when you blow your chances life smiles back. My sister told me once, in raltion toa nother Irish mob film, life strangles you but does not choke you to death. I guess she was right.  Bless her and bless my nephew that was recently christianed. May he have as much chance as I have had in my life.   Mood: slightly insomniac but looking to the future
