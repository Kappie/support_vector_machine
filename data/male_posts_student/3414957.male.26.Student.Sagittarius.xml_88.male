I need something to occupy that space. I hate this. I hate this. I hate this. I need a vaction from my mind. Hmmm, maybe I should just start a new split personality.   On a hydration note, I have drank 1 XL coffee, half of my bottled water, and half of my Poweraide jug. I have been taking a leak almost every 10 min it seems! I know, TMI right?
