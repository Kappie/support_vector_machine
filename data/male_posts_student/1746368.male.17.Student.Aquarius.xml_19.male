I can't drink water, I'm weird, I don't like the taste of it.  Hopefully tomorrow my mom and I are going to go to Book Oasis (a really neat-o used book store) to get some bookage. Although I would rather go today, neither my mom nor I have any money.  Yes! I just got back from Sarah (the worship leader at my youth group) that I am co-leading worship on Wednesday. I can't wait! I am finally moving towards what I want to do with my life.  Eh, not a very long entry, I will try to do something exciting later today, I don't know what though. Remember: On the other hand...you always have five fingers.
