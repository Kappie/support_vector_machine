I dont give a flyign fuck about going back and seeing whoever the fuck I didnt care about 2 months ago. Fuck it all. All I shall do is go to school, exist if even that, come home do shit, and then go with the few or numbered real friends I have and have fun on the weekends and exist until next summer. FUCK SCHOOL. FUCK BALLARD. FUCK EAST END RICH ASS PREPS.  I played better at practice today. Made some damn good saves and only messed up like 2 times. I still need to get better at some stuff. But Derek didnt say but 1 thing to me that was bad today. I did however hurt my thumb which sucks ass.
