It is a word I accidenally made up when trying to type cliche to Angela Yen... So some credit must go to her for forcing me to attempt such a difficult word. After typing it i decided it should become a word.  So I entered it into Urban Dictionary and made a definition.   urlLink Here  is the definition.  I think a lot of you will be feeling quleshe within the next couple weeks, because of finals and such... I wish you well on that adventure... been feeling that way for a couple weeks now, and its really not to bad. I promise the next entry will not be boring, it will be a picture or two...  -Dan V
