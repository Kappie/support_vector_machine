My numbers for today (a day of down pour).  Art History 550E: 8/10 (Dec. 15)  Art History 572F: 8/17 (Dec. 10)  Sociology 607: 12/18 (Dec. 16)  Sociology 616: 3/20 (Dec. 11)  Totals: 31 / 65 = 47.7%  Remaining: 34 pages / approx. 22 days = 1.5 per day   I'm extremely unsure about Thanksgiving. I don't know if I can take a day or two off. I really won't know until early next week. I could bring my laptop, but that would also mean bringing books with me. A laptop, clothes, and books being hauled from Binghamton to NJ via bus doesn't sound fun at all.  **
