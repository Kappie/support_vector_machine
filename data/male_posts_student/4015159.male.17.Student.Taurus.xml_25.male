Anyway I've done the maintenence and it STILL isn't shutting down properly. Pretty soon I'm just gonna have to leave it in constant standby to make sure my graphics card doesn't corrupt!          Tonight, as we all know, is the Big Brother 2004 final, in which we will see either Dan, Jason, Nadia or Shell be crowned King or Queen (Queen if Shell wins teehee) of Big Brother. What an interesting series we've had. 10 weeks ago myself and Andy sat in my living room and watched what seemed to be 12 utter weirdo's enter the house. From Kitten's entrance outburst and Marco's very annoying screaming every big brother fan knew that this year was going to be VERY different.          The first week was a week of rebellion in which we saw leader Kitten not conform to the rules of Big Brother, Big Brother retalliated and kicked her out on her fat ass, also dropping the new £100000 prize found by £9000 just for her insolence. Personaly I believed that with Kitten gone it wouldn't be very interesting anymore, but oh boy I was wrong:           Two words, The Bedsit. I do not believe I have laughed as much at Big Brother whilst Emma and Michelle were in the bedsit. Emma (The gal who shudda won Big Brother) was classic! Michelle mothered her throughout the bedsit and also added much needed comedy by talking to the camera slagging off Vanessa. From Victor's cold showers to the chilli cake and Marco saying "Big Brother, So Twisted," I was giggling my ASS off!          But what was to come could be considered one of the most intense nights in Big Brother, possibly television, history. On Day 20 Michelle and Emma were released from the bedsit and were allowed to go back into the Big Brother house. But the excitement was too much and all hell broke loose. Arguments became likely and began happening. Victor vs Emma, Jason vs Marco and Nadia, it must have been very frightening for the fellow housemates. After the arguments came trays being thrown between Emma and Victor almost resulting in the TV shows first ever fight. Thankfully Dan managed to calm the atmosphere and Emma was put back into the bedsit, eventually being given the boot.          Only 3 weeks in and we'd had more Brilliance from the show than ANY other series of the hit reality show. Anyway weeks went on and Big Brother was becoming VERY evil! Some tasks were fun but then came the Boot Camp task, giving Michelle and Jason a horrible task. They became sergeants and had to lead the privates into passing daily challenges, however if the privates passed they would be up for eviction, if they failed the sergeants would be. Only Michelle and Jason were allowed to know this information, but some housemates had ideas. Ahmed may not have had an idea but he was very jealous of Michelle being a sergeant over him. So jealous he faked illness... making Michelle very angry. Probably my favourite line from the series came from Michelle's mouth during a dispute. "What the fuck are you doing here?" Doesn't read that well but IMAGINE it in a geordie accent.          Well the weeks went on and now, Day 69, will see the best ever series of Big Brother end. I will be routing for Nadia tonight even though I have been thinking Jason has been a good housemate. I think he should come second! Anyway peeps I'll be blogging tomorrow!          TTFN, Jim
