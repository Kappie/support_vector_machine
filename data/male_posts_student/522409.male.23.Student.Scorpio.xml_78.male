Stressed because I got sick and overextended and have been trying to play catch-up at school since spring break.  Confused because I finally decided that I wanted to like a girl and I ended up liking two.  And one exists in two levels of consciousness, I've found--one that's incredibly sweet and kind and interested in me, and one that's entirely focused on herself, material/superficial things, and uh... I dunno.  The other is a good friend who could probably be more, but I'm awful at reading signals, and probably doesn't want anything more than the really awesome friendship we already have.  Nice.  Disappointed because I've let stress and distraction win, and I've let my grades slip this semester.  Granted, I let them slip in two classes that were associated with a major I'm not going to do, but still, it's on the GPA, and it'll look an awful lot like I'm falling back into old habits.  First semester, I was unstoppable.  Second semester, supremely distractable.  Fuck.  Also, and consider this Confusion Part Deux, is I'm sorting through this haze of doubt as to whether I should be coming back to the Sound.  I know that what I have to offer, and my beliefs about the group, need to be present one more time to secure it in the consciousness of the new guys.  And man am I psyched about the new guys... I can't wait to sing with them.  BUT, I'm experiencing a bit of what Roo was telling me about: the resentment toward the little gigs we do--schools, community centers, sundry little gigs that take up precious time; as well as feeling entirely too old to be doing this one more time.  That sounds ridiculous, and I hope it is.  I'm 23, Samrat left when he was 27.  I've got time... but it's not just about numbers... I want to keep moving forward, and I keep fearing that this summer is just a distraction when I should be taking 20 credits at Berklee and getting my ass to Nashville as soon as humanly possible.  Maybe this will fade when finals end.  No more.  I have to go to a recording session.  I'll write more later.  Like September.
