It's supposed to be a 50's theme, so I can either dress up as a greaser, I can put on a poodle skirt, a business suit, my birthday suit... nevermind. But it sucks cus its my last time i get to see ave until december :'(. But hey, I can be kewl w/ that, cus it's not like she never comin back right? RIGHT? of course im right! :-p but anywho, i kinda bored so ima go now. L8R
