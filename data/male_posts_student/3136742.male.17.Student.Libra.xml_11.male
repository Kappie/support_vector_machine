I’m sitting here trying to find out how and why, but I can’t figure it out for the life of me. Take my math teacher [Rodney Dangerfield] Take my math teacher, please! [/Rodney Dangerfield] *ahem* so, this woman is, as my friend Theo would say, a “cunty bitch.” We’ll call her “MT” because those are her initials and she’s a Math Teacher—how conveeeeeeeinient! She has, by far, the most abrasive, anger-driven, scolding personality I have ever encountered. I hate her. She is definitely not attractive (she looks like Joe Camel). Then why, as irony would have it, do I want to fuck her (angry Donkey-Punch and Dirty Sanchez sex)? It makes no sense! **[Edit]** I've decided to remove what I wrote in here about my ex-girlfriend. It was a little too disrespectful and immature. So I'll just say she was a cool girl but we were the furthest thing from compatible. We both realized this but I didn't want to admit it. I was lazy and didn't want to have to look for a new girlfriend so I tried to salvage our joke of a relationship. **[/Edit]**I’m just too attracted to people I could never have a successful relationship with. I like these people as friends, no, like is too specific and positive of a word—I enjoy these people as friends because our personalities conflict so much it makes things interesting. But what is this insatiable sexual attraction to people who make me want to puke?! (This doesn’t go for saying that I’m only attracted to bitches)  Another question that just entered my mind-- I believe this is the definitive paradox--King of all conundrums: Is it in my character to do things that are out-of-character, leaving out-of-character actions impossible, or, would doing something out-of-character be tremendously out-of-character for me because out-of-character actions are not in my character? Does my being bipolar make an answer to this question even more impossible?
