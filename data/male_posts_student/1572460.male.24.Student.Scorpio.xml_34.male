They will carefully pen down everything that happened in the last 24 hours of their life. If that is not enough, they will even diligently reply to  each and every  comment people post. Nothing wrong in writing about all and sundry once in a while though...  Summers are awesome in Colorado. Long, sunny days, with intermittent showers (although 2002, I very much know, was an exception). It never really pours cats and dogs here; won't exactly soak you, but is enough to get some respite from the otherwise burning sun, and for the reservoirs. I haven't explored Colorado as much as I would have liked. The #1 thing on my outdoors wish-list is to scale a fourteener (a fourteen-thousand foot mountain, half that of Mt. Everest, if you would like). There are 54 of these in Colorado alone, out of the 100-odd in the USA. California comes a distant second with 14-15, I think. Needless to say, this place is a paradise on earth, if you truly wish to explore the back-country and stuff and are an outdoors fanatic.  Saturday was such a day -- wonderful, wonderful weather. Not too hot, not too cold, a bit on the breezy side with a little cloud cover, the sun choosing to play hide-and-seek. In fact 2004 has been amazing. Right from April, the weather has been more or less very much pleasant. Usually, in this part of the world, a few days of 80-90 Deg F, are followed by days where the temperature dips to 50-60 Deg F. The very unpredictable nature of the weather can sometimes be a welcoming prospect. Ideal conditions for activities like biking, if the wind is behind your back, ofcourse. So, went biking on the weekend to Horsetooth, Spring Creek and Poudre trails with Snehal, Vidya and Katrix. I have done these trails twice before, but every time I have went, there has somehow been a different feel to them. Especially the Horsetooth trail. It starts off with a steep incline, with a couple of really sharp spoon-curves, where, unless you have a good bike with a good set of gears, you have to walk it up whole. My gears slipped once in a while, so had to climb (walk) up a couple 100 metres. Plus, mountain bikes don't help; if you have a road bike, nothing like it. The incline gradually turns into a short flat stretch of road, where you get to see a beautiful view of the front range mountains and the famous horsetooth rock with the clear blue reservoir waters in the foreground. Then its a downhill slope all the way (which I must say, is a thrilling ride), and while you are cycling down, there's another panoramic view of the waters and the mountains. Snehal took these lovely pictures. Click on the thumbnails to check the larger versions. The first two were taken when we were on the Horsetooth trail and the last was on the Poudre, where Snehal did an excellent job of zooming in on the prairie-dog.   urlLink      urlLink      urlLink     I look a bit slumped in the second picture, don't know why, but don't be mistaken that I have put on weight, although I would be more than happy to put on more. We hadn't slept the previous night (Friday) at all, not even a wink, thanks to the usual chat session with Sid, Vaibhav and Snehal. To our own surprise, Snehal and I weren't exhausted even a bit, considering we biked 15-16 miles for sure.  Sunday was more relaxing, catching up on some much needed sleep, most of the time. But come evening, and we are itching to play cricket. Yes, that's our newly found passion this summer. Turning a couple of basketball courts into a cricket field, we are reviving the good ol' days of galli cricket, although admittedly, we play pretty hard, unlike those days where pure, unadulterated fun was the only norm -- not that its not pure, unadulterated fun anymore -- that is the very basis after all. It's just that we think of ourselves as "adults", now, or errr...should we not?! Ah, anything for a game like cricket.
