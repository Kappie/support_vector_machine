"The Middle" by Jimmy Eat World  hey, dont write your self off yet its only in your head you feel left out  or looked down on just try your best try everything you can and dont you worry what they tell themselves  when your away  it just takes some time little girl your in the middle of the ride everything(everything) will be just fine everything(everything) will be alright (alright)  hey, you know they're all the same. you know you're doing better on your own, so don't buy in.  live right now. yeah, just be yourself. it doesn't matter if its good enough, for someone else.  It just takes some time, little girl you're in the middle of the ride everything (everything) will be just fine,  everything (everything) will be alright (alright)  (repeat)  (instrumental solo)  hey,dont write yourself off yet.  its only in your head you feel left out  or looked down on. just do your best, do everything you can. and don't you worry what the bitter hearts are gonna say.   It just takes some time, little girl you're in the middle of the ride.  everything (everything) will be just fine, everything (everything) will be alright (alright)  (repeat) /end  Delve into it as you will, I will provide no further insight.. (it's pretty self-explanatory, geez)
