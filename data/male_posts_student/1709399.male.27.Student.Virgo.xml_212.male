Since I didn't have french classes this saturday, I decided to go   be part of the Audience during the Shooting of the Program "Big Fight" hosted by Rajdeep Sardesai on Saturday. The Topic was "Do Indians prefer Dynasty (Read Nehru family) rule ? " . The BJP and the Congress got into a verbal duel ( they even fought during the commercial break time!!) with Omar Abdulhah(NC) providing some unbiased inputs. The program was recorded very well in the studio and I was lucky that my Question " Even in family run businessess the progeny spends at least 10 years in different depts/positions before gunning for the CEO post . Why does Congress , a 119 year old party with 10 million members convey the desperation that only the Nehru family can save them ? " got selected as the first question and I got my 20 seconds of TV Time and my Question was answered by Anand Sharma (Spokesperson,Congress)  Omar Abdullah. Got a first-hand experience of the Animosity of our politicians .
