I just want to know when they are gonna learn that they will never be able to get rid of drugs in this country. The war on drugs ignores the basic law of supply and demand. That when there is a demand for a product, there will ALWAYS be someone to supply it. The question then becomes is that someone going to be ruthless drug cartels from all over the world, or is it going to be from legitimate businesses within the US that can actually be taxed? You continue to allow criminals to make money by keeping drugs illegal, or you can legalize them and make money from their sale. I mean tobacco kills far more people every year than all other drugs combined and it' s legal so what the fucking problem. The fucking problem is stupid uptight fucks that don't know anything and think drugs are morally wrong and therefore they should be illegal. It seems odd to think that the people that know the least about drugs are in control of keeping them illegal. And how about this http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/scheduling.html. Looking through this you see a shit load of things you have probably never heard of in your life. I find it odd that drugs like THC, DMT, and magic mushrooms are all schedule 1 drugs. Schedule 1 being the least likely to be legalized. So I ask you what schedule is cocaine and crack on this government list? Schedule 2! Fucking schedule 2. That means that marijuana is less liking to be legalized that cocaine according to it's scheduling. Anyways, I need to go so I will have to continue this some other time.
