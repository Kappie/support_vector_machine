I mainly asked the questions to Drewcifer because I consider him one of they few people that understand wrestling in a way deeper than just thinking they know what they are talking about (like me) So without further adieu...the roundtable  Peter -- First off do you think that Taker deserves a shot?  Peter -- why or why not?  Drewcifer -- hell yeah he does Drewcifer -- Taker has been solidly behind the Mcmahons through thick and thin Peter -- yes he has, and through all his matches where he has jobbed for people (Cena included) he should dang well win the title next week  Peter -- But if he does win it...that is another story  Peter -- as a mark who do you think would win this match?  Drewcifer -- he's not going to win the title next week Peter -- why not?  Drewcifer -- Taker is contyent in his role as a locker room leader... Peter -- good point  Drewcifer -- plus everyone loves angle Peter -- I never really looked at it that way  Drewcifer -- Angle is going to take the belt all the way to Wrestlemania Peter -- if you were the Undertaker next week, who would you more than likely look to come from the back? Because with WWE these days nobody will job for anyone anymore  Drewcifer -- keep in mind that next months PPV is a RAW only thing Peter -- ah yes  Peter -- didn't Raw have the last one before summerslam?  Drewcifer -- Besides, Angle has everyone's respect in the back Drewcifer -- no, Smackdown! had the last one Peter -- But say by hook or crook Taker wins the belt at SD! next Thursday....and then what would happen?  Drewcifer -- won't happen Peter -- you sound so posative  Drewcifer -- I'm betting on some sort of run-in from brock or slow Drewcifer -- or both Peter -- why would they take out taker though? have they formed an alliance? are they going to take out taker then go after angle?  Drewcifer -- hard to say Peter -- lets look farther down the line, like say to Mania XX...and lets say that Angle is going to hold the title  Peter -- and he fued with the obvious norms of SD! main events....lesnar...pig slow....taker...do you think that we could see another fatal 4 way elimination match like at mania 2000 (mania 16)??  Drewcifer -- honestly, I think they're going to build up to Angle/ Lesnar for Survivor Series and do it again at Mania Drewcifer -- in the meantime?  sure Peter -- have Angle and the Undertaker had any feuds in the past?  Drewcifer -- Angle/Lesnar has the potential to be one of the greatest feuds of all time Drewcifer -- Taker/Angle? Peter -- i heard someone say that it could possible be as big as the hogan/andre feud of the past  Drewcifer -- none that I can remember Drewcifer -- I said that Peter -- maybe armageddon hell in a cell..but that involved so many other guys....the immortal HHH....Rikishi...Rock....and Austin  Peter -- ahh yes....you did didn't you...or did you?  Drewcifer -- Austin!! Peter -- lets skip shows here for a second....(yes austin)  Peter -- what is your opinion on the IMMORTAL ONE.... eveyones favorite dillhole Triple H?  Drewcifer -- Hell YEAH!!! Peter -- ha ha (in case you haven't figured it out...Drewcifer is a HUGE Austin fan)  Drewcifer -- honestly? Peter -- yes honest  Peter -- keep the profanitly a little low though...what if some kid reads this....  Drewcifer -- the thing is, back in the day, when I was your age, pedro, I hated Ric Flair Drewcifer -- He would never loser his title to anyone Drewcifer -- as I got older and became more educated about wrestling Peter -- I think I might know where you are going with this  Drewcifer -- I realized that I loved to hate Ric Flair Peter -- (good point)  Drewcifer -- which is why he was so over Drewcifer -- and now HHH is the same way Drewcifer -- except I'm a little more educated in the inner works of wrestling these days Peter -- like HHH is Ric Flair in some ways...do you think that having Ric by his side....the WHOOOO 16 TIME CHAMP!....makes anyone 'love to hate' Triple H anymore?  Drewcifer -- but I hate HHH just like I hated Flair back in the day Peter -- how about the Hair on Nash? I have wanted to blog about this forever!...what do you think about it?  Drewcifer -- I'm really not concerned about the hairdo's on the guys... Drewcifer -- now a Trish/Victoria hair vs. Hair match... Peter -- WHOA!! That would be a nice one to see! I'm sure all the fans would love it  Peter -- ok...Closing Comments?  Drewcifer -- I'm marking out for Brock Lesnar Peter -- explain  Drewcifer -- I think he's the future of wrestling Peter -- like another Hogan...or Freddie Blassie type even?  Drewcifer -- along with Rey Rey Peter -- I think that Rey is getting old....how old is he do ya know?  Peter -- like 30s? Drewcifer -- If the writers use them correctly Peter -- then again Terry Funk was doin some moonsaults at age 54 for the WWE (then wwf)  Peter -- yeah like in WCW they had Rey Rey run with Nash and almost win the belt  Drewcifer -- I think rey Rey deserves a run with the title Peter -- so do I  Peter -- maybe just maybe in the future do you think that he acutally will?  Drewcifer -- I'd love to see a Rey Rey angle match Peter -- already happened my friend  Drewcifer -- for the title, I mean. I'm talking about a Main Event Peter -- ah...sorry...I was going to say almost one year ago at SS 2002 they met Drewcifer -- I remember Peter -- can you recall who won the match?  Drewcifer -- Angle Peter -- ah yes...angle lock correct? Im looking it up now. Peter -- Hey you are right Drew! You really really know your stuff when it comes to wrestling!  Drewcifer -- then again I'd alaso like to see Booker T, or RVD run with the title as well Peter -- ok well with that nice long rant about Rey Rey, Booker T, and RVD...I think I am going to close the Roundtable...Peace
