I always feel bad about distrubing people in their sleep unless they really do ask for it. In this case I even have proof of it.   i need a favour from you. when you go to get your spiritual fast food today come by and wake me up . see ya   So I did. I only saw a courtain moving and I made a thumbs up sign. the hand that moved the courtain did the same. That was quite funny image I have to use it somewhere.  Beers form 6 o'clock. That is it.  Mood: definetly good though I should be working more.
