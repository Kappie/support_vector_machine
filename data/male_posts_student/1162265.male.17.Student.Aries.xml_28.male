They said, the Universe was the same thing as God, which I kind of believed, then a person said they didn't need to believe in afterlife they'd existed since the begginning of time.  There is no need for people to have souls, we've always existed as part of the Universe and even when we die we are still part of it, just not held together by conscious.  My old view of things had been that we were already dead, from the second we were born, but this view is that we always were, and always will be alive.  Nice outlook.  Modern religions are great.
