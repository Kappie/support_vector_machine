Lots and lots of rain this morning with nice temperatures (until you got  inside  the school, then you were freezing your ass off) followed by the damn sun making it hot and humid. I jut can't win in this state.  Today was the last day of classes for the Seniors, so from henceforth I'll be part of the leading class. Not that I'm special or anything among my peers, but it's fun to feel on top. I think that the powers held by Seniors should be transfered to Juniors upon abdication, like getting out for lunch 5 minutes earlier (makes all the difference, trust me). But alas, Mr. Beasley will have none of that going on. At least Physics is fun.  I have the suspicion that Josh skipped school today (and last Friday). Today and Friday he was home when I got home at 3:40. He said Friday was a power problem and today was some teacher promotion. I think it is a load of BS. He cracked more or less about today, but he's set about Friday's events. Whatever. Mom believes the little twit anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter. He thinks he so clever too, but his IM has been logged in since 11:30 this morning on Mom's iBook and he  NEVER  leaves it open unattended, plus it's 11:30 no matter how you slice it. I've only skipped a whole day once Freshman year, but he's in 7th grade and not doing fabulously well (good, but not stellar). He keeps it up he'll be a drop out.
