I'll call it that when they win Stanley Cup sometime in the next......75 years? Hopefully anyways....yeah so so far basically the teams I rootin' for *Vancouver and Colorado.....Sens over Leafs* are all doing well =D.  And of course FINALLY the long weekend is here. After a long waited week.....through many toils and fatigue....it's finally here. Easter Weekend. I'm just wondering what I'm doing though this weekend......so far it's lookin like this:  Friday: Good Friday Church Service, then Badminton, then Workin' Out Saturday: Don't know yet.....I still got Piano *Shudder* Sunday: Church, don't know what else after then....maybe homework? Monday: No clue at all.....depends if I do homework on Sunday  As you can see I'm mass future planner eh =P. I wish I was headin' out to Toronto this weekend though....I mean 4 days you can do some stuff...Martha was gonna have a reunion.....arghhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Lol I wonder how many are goin' to that though. Oh well for me....I gotta wait for summer to come. If any other Maafaah kids read this......tell the others I said hi =). I'm still stuck in good ol' Londontown for weekend....waaaaah Toronto!  And on a daily note......to summarize up my day.  Woke up this morning with the notification stuck in my mind of the fact today was last day of school week. So waking up this morning was pretty joyful. Though it was a day 2, no worries =P. It was a pretty cool day two, and of course just the fact it was end of school week.....that cancels out all possible sadness =P. So this morning headed to school with a smile on knowing "in 6 hours.....the dictorial attidude of school will be forgotten for 24x4 hours" =P.  Music class today....NO REP TEST!? SHWEEEEEET! Mrs. Wharton was unfortunately sick *mood change there hehe* so we sadly had Mr. Clark teaching us. Yeah apparently Mrs. Wharton was sick today so Mr. Clark merged the two classes together into one big class. Wasn't too bad of a class....played music like usual and stuff. Not much happened in music today. Just usual little jokes and stuff. Then we broke up for brass ensemble, wind ensemble and whatever the saxophone and percussion do. Us brass people just sat around twidling our thumbs...talking...which leads to this little quote:  Connor: EVERYONE SHUT UP AND LISTEN TO ME! I'll conduct =). There's only a ME in TEAM Fred: Oh yeah? Well there's also a U in SUCK *strange laugh like science geek from the Simpsons*  Yeah the main focus was probably Fred's line.....lol U in Suck. Never really thought of that play on words.....very creative haha. Oh yeah and heading back into class......found Tanis conducting? W...T.....H? Teacher not doing job? *looks outside* OOOOOOOH he's conducting saxes....good call =P. Saxes seem somewhat musically challenged at times thats all lol. Jokes.  Science....today we had 70 minutes to finish up this vector assignment. SO stupid. Got to know Toronto a bit better though haha...Gavin, Josh, David and Jason: next time I'll actually know where I'm going in Toronto....hey at least I know Toronto better than Dave sadly =P. He lives out there. Anyways yeah finished the assignment....then went out for lunch.  McD's for today. Yes some grease platters.....my favourite *not.* Wow took forever to decide where to go today though. It's kinda nice to have McD's every once in a while though I guess. Wait what am I saying? Eeew I should smack my head against the wall for that.....EEW what WAS I saying!? If Subway was 3 bux for a sub combo I'd go there everyday. Why must Subway cost more than Chinese Dim Sum it seems at times? I can get a platter of fried rice for the price of a footlong sub. But I still buy it every once in a while...just don't go overkill on $$$.  Bio class.....Saliva lab. Spitting in 4 test tubes gets you pretty dehydrated after a while. It was pretty sickening too though. Saliva+HCl+water=almost solid solution. Eew. Lol or maybe it was just the cracker at the top acting as a plug. I don't know but when I turned tube upside down....it didn't spill out haha. Lab was pretty cool though. I looked like a crack addict splitting up a soda cracker into 4 piles of crushed powder with a ruler. Yes.......I kinda realize why crack addicts are retards. Wow I felt retarted doing that lol. Spendin $500 bucks doing that and then killin' yourself in the process? Wow......you need rehab =P. Only another 75 minutes and home time! =).  English.......IT'S ENGLISH NOT HISTORY CLASS! We spent 70 friggin' minutes relearning the depression 30's. My mom n' dad pays their taxes for me to learn history in history and english in english.....NOT HISTORY IN ENGLISH....ESPECIALLY RELEARNED MATERIAL. So we spent our time learning about that....dunno why but apparently it links with our new book "Fried Green Tomatoes At the Whistle Stop Cafe." A book that flips back and forth between depression 30's and a retirement home with a crazy woman that talks 24/7 about random stuff and a depressed woman who eats a lot. REALLY weird book and I don't see why it's considered an "amazing" book. IT'S SO STUPID. But who cares about that..when it's HOMETIME! =). WHOO! THE BEGINNING OF 4 AND A HALF DAYS OF FREEDOM! FREEEEEDDDOOOOOOOM!  First thing I do for long weekend: HEAD 2 HEAD GAMES LOL. I know it's kinda sad...but hey it was pretty funy =P. Tried out BF Vietnam.....GREAT game but I prefer original BF over it. Got overrun on Omaha like last time. Oi and in Midway map.....watching the water go by while swimming......VERY nauseating lol. But it was fun times there for 2 hours. After playing BF and BFV played some Quake III. Haven't played that game in almost a year.....and only 2nd time playing. Wow......2nd, 3rd, then 5th place. Not bad for first  time playing lol. Arjun was there too....oh yeah almost forgot about that. I beat him =P. My style of playing derives from Adrian's a lot........circle strafe, mash keyboard to dodge bullets, etc. Works very well =P. Quake III is so funny and stupid...but fun at times haha. Got a ride from Mophead home afterwards. Dunno what Arjun did. Was actually kinda weird seeing him there then gaming with him. He's an alright kid though I guess.....got nothin' against him. Then again I try not to make enemies.  Like the Lord said:   "Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against one of your people, but love your neighbor as yourself. I am the LORD."  -Leviticus 19:18  Sometimes when I think about Christianity.....I mean I don't see why people like to throw it away. I mean...really in the long run it helps you. It prevents you from doing stupid things and theoretically if all is done by the Book and His Word.....this world would be perfect. *Sigh* why must people ignore the Love of Christ? Life would be so much easier for everyone.  Like I was saying earlier though.....after Head 2 Head got home. Ate, Drummed, then SC for a bit. Played two melee games with Jason then.......HOLY CRAP 7PM ALREADY!? NHL TIME! Sens Vs. Leafs....  WOW Leafs can't penalty kill. And bad luck for them too...after scoring 3 minutes in.....Marchment gets a puck off his skate and past Belfour. Whoops? Hahahaha afterwards they'd lose anyways.....4-2 for Sens. I fell asleep though....got the score from Antoine haha. Fell asleep after 2nd period......soo.....  *WUMP*  *3.5 hours later*  Yes I'm awake and well now.....it was 11:50pm.....now it's almost 130am lol. I've been around the house eating etc. etc. Gotta sleep though soon...still got Church service to head to tomorrow....ugh won't be able to sleep though from a 4 hour nap...meh. SC? Anyone? lol j/k I've had enough of games. And I just missed Conan O'Brien. *D'OH!* So yeah.....nothin' much else left......guess sleep? Lol Later.  Happy Easter everyone!
