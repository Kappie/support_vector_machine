This is a problem, its not an easy choice in the first place, and its made worse by pretty much every person around me. Im talking specifically about teachers, parents etc. Now this isnt a new point but its worth repeating. At my age it is drummed into us that choices we make at this age will affect us for our whole lives, now i dont know whether this is true or not, i cant speak from experience, but im pretty damn sure that its not as important as they make it out to be, it adds a lot of stress to the preceedings. Which brings me to my second point, the rest of my life, what do i want to do with it? I used to think, and still do to some extent, that there wasnt much point living unless you made a difference, unless you changed the world, unless you won some victory for mankind, otherwise whats the point? This is a way of coping with the realisation that life is pointless, now thats not a huge reveleation, its something we all know but most of us choose to ignore, those of us that don't tend to go a bit crazy. So my most difficult question is this, do i go all out to try to make a difference (doctor, politician, scientist), to try to make my life a little less pointless, or do i just have fun , do i do what i really want to do (open a restauraunt), and just have a good time while it lasts, and then die knowing that my life was essentially a waste of time. Well thats what i used to think, but now im thinking maybe it wasn't a waste of time, maybe the point is to have fun (see my earlier post on drink). Whatever i choose, i need to make a decision now, or so my teachers tell me =).
