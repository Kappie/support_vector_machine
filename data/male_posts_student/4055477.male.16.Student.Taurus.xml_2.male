(I dunno, somehow i thought I was gonna just skip that little part about me  for the next, ever .. considering how many guy friends i've lost in the past.. ) He was really cool about it.. makes me happy that someone gets it (even if its just alittle..)  -Anyways, he was supportive and I liked that when I told him, he didnt just let the window blink and watch in awe as I basically slit myself open and spilled my guts onto the table..  I mightve just made a friend today..   - -Right now i'm goin through drama in other areas that I dont wanna worsen, but i'll just say that it was all my fault..  Also, if i wasnt a passivist i'd kick someones ass right now .. (Bitch..)  I gotta let go of the issues and buckle down..  7  days until the end of the world.. (i'm goin to  hell )..  ttyl.. (Talk to you later..)
