I have aspirations for this blog to become a fully fledged site but this needs me to get to grips with a little more html than i understand at the moment. Posts are on the way for all sub-blogs but even more than that Polls are being added, statistic counters are being added and photo albums are being compiled. I am hoping to nick the source code for a links section on my sidebar so as to list my affliates. Things are changing and the only way is up.  (oh yeh i have this cool little graphich fo when i close a sub site for some reason. see it on friday feeling as a preview)
