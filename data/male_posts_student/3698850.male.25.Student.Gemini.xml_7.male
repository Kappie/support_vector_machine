I performed in front of like 15 people and 5 comics, which aren't really people anyway.  I got a good reaction and realized that it wasn't just because of the way I have altered the words I use, but more due to the delivery.  I am learning about how to do comedy more and more every day, and am, for the first time, proud of what I am doing as a comic.  So come check me out at the Stress Factory on Church Street in New Brunswick every Wednesday night at 8:00.  It's an open mic, but it is only 5$, so fucking come.  Thanks.
