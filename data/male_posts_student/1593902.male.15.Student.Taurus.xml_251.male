Brandy hangs up at 6 or so. :i'll call ya back" by 7:35 i knew she wouldn't call back. this was like on Friday.   pulls the SAMe shit today. at 10:45 hung up on michelle, in CASE she might call. fell asleep around 11:45, and woke up at 12:45 in case she called at 1 like last year. which would abeen genius since she would only had to talk to me five minutes, say i'm tired and i got to_________ tomorrow. Night.  Stupidly, i even checked me texts and voice mails.   Nothing.Nno, now i don't even get that bullshit excuse.  Now it's i'll say i'll call ya later and that's that until next time you call em, cause i'm too lazy to lift my five fucking fingers outta me ass and and pick up and dial a number that i've fucking memorized, and talk for a minute, only if to say , thanks for for trying to keep the friendship alive, though i have no fucking interest in you, goodbye, burn in hell.   Or maybe it's just that she doesn't wanna talk. Fair enough. Seems I only annoy her now. And if not go call me some other day!  What kind of fucking friend does this shit?  Bet ya the house i live on if that was odie that said that, at 8 i'd have been on the phone with her again. And should she read this she'll go "but that's odette". So waht ya fucking mong. It's Franco. Ya don't like it, tell me to fuck off and that's that.  And this applies for any of you assholes.   Let's not be a total ass, kill my sleeping habits, because I'm a complete fuckwit. Because i still have a ton of belief in ya and abuse that. Then when i act like an ass with you, you act like a dick.  Brandy, for once let's try NOT to let me down, i'm depressed enough as it is, it would help if ya ACTED like ya gave a flying shit, as a charitable gift to me. Your good deed of the day for a fucking loser like me.  I don't know if that's too much to ask for though, so i'm sorry if i'm asking for too much.
