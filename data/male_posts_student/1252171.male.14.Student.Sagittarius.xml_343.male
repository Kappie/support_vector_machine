Tehe, hey guys, I thought I asked you two to email me...anyways, I was talking to Mike, since he's the only who, like calls me here, when I don't call you guys (meaning everyone) on the weekends. Oh, well. Hey, SI, did you notice the new stuff you can do when your publishing a post? It looks so cool! Oh, Mom bought a couch btw, and I'm getting cabel (spelling?) today! No more watching Disney movies over and over again! Did you know that I actually had to resort to watching  My Neighbor Totoro  something differant besides IY all the time? *Mental flinch*  These people in a truck kept asking me if I wanted a ride to the freeway last night, so I said "Yo no comprehende engles', siento!"  Bye for now! EMAIL ME!!! -Dilussional Child-
