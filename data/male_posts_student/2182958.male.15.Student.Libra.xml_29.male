People who just...don't deserve what they have.   And this person...is considered a role model for millions of American girls, she's beautiful, she's charming, she's perfect.   YEAH RIGHT.   Who am i talking about?  None other than:     BRITNEY FUCKING SPEARS  Ever since she appeared on the scene back in 1999 i have disliked her. Why you may ask?  A few reasons:  1.   SHE CAN'T SING:   If you've ever taken the time to notice...what she sings about is total nonsense and utter  bullshit.  I mean her songs really aren't about anything else besides having sex with random men, not being too young, not being too old, not being a girl, not being a woman, doing it again, and having lips that are capable of injuring or killing by poison....or being TOXIC.  2.   Can she keep her breasts under control?:   If you haven't noticed, the size of Britney's breats change dramatically. Need proof?     Britney before the dramatic change.     New and improved.  3.   Can she make up her fucking mind?:   Britney seems to be confused..about a lot of things...her lyrics seem to have changed along with her body.  Examples:     "Hit Me Baby One More Time"  -  from the album "Baby One More Time"     Lyrics:  Oh baby, baby Oh baby, baby Oh baby, baby How was I supposed to know That something wasn't right here Oh baby baby I shouldn't have let you go And now you're out of sight, yeah Show me, how you want it to be Tell me baby 'Cause I need to know now what we've got  ( How was i supposed to know? this must mean how was she supposed to know how her man was feeling when she slept with the guy next store. )  [CHORUS:] My loneliness is killing me I must confess, I still believe When I'm not with you I lose my mind Give me a sign Hit me baby one more time    ( This is basically saying she is lonley and she wants to get humped one more time. )   Slutty? I think so.  Let us also analyze lyrics to  "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman"     "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman"   -  from the album "Britney"   Lyrics:   I used to think  (....really?)  I had the answers to everything  (If you do why dont you answer this: Are you an attention whore?   Or just a whore? )        But now I know   That life doesn't always go my way , yeah (When life doesnt go your way....where does it go?)   Feels like I'm caught in the middle  (No...but something else is...) That's when I realize   I'm not a girl, not yet a woman  (If you're not a girl and you're not a woman...then you've gotta be that other thing....)  All I need is time A moment that is mine While I'm in between  I'm not a girl (....she admits it)   There is no need to protect me (...from sexually transmitted diseases.. ) It's time that I Learn to face up to this on my own, oh  I've seen so much more ( penis ) than you know now   So don't tell me to shut my eyes  (well....think about it...)  I'm not a girl, not yet a woman  All I need is time ( ...to hide the damaging effects of herpes..)  A moment that is mine  While I'm in between (...his legs ) I'm not a girl     You will see it in my eyes But if you look at me closely This girl will always find her way (into your pants!)    Basically what Britney is saying is that she is horny and can't wait to have sex and she just wants it over and over every single day.    And she goes on to other singles such as "I'm a Slave for You" and "Oops! I Did it Again." to say things such as "I'm not that innocent."  ...which leaves me to do nothing but agree.  YOU ARE  NOT  INNOCENT.  ...AT ALL.   4.   Can she get any sluttier?:   If you own a television set and have atleast basic cable...or atlest free cable, you probably have noticed how scandalous and how....skanky she looks.      "Oops..my shirt fell off!"      Skank ho.      Fat ass.         ATTENTION    WHORE!    I think i rightfully proved my point. Britney Spears is not a good example for little girls nor is she someone to turn to for advice..seeing that her own life is very fucked up as she keeps getting "screwed." Someone stuff a fucking sock in her throat. For all our sakes.     Also...     MADDOX RULES      I was reading things on Maddox's site and i thought "wow i want to be as smart as this guy..this guy...he is the man." >Which he is.  And what i just pulled a few lines up^ Yeah well that was influenced by Maddox...i have something on my mind...and that is:  Britney Spears sucks ass.    urlLink Go to Maddox
