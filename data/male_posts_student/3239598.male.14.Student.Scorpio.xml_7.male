The rest of my day, unfortunately, has not been so.  This whole "thing" is tearing everyone apart and I just can't stand it anymore.  Michael's right, bad things continue to happen, over and over, back to back.  Can't everything just be all peaceful?  That would be nice.  But, you know what?  Such is not, and from the looks of things, such will never be.  Sadly.  Oh well, what am I complaining about?  I don't even know what the problem IS.  But, when everyone else is unhappy, I am also unhappy.  The extent of my knowledge knows that this is my fault, because if I didn't exist, this all would not have happened.  *sighs*  I suppose you could say that God sends us troubles to keep us awake with life and not to allow us to become too lazy and laid-back with life.  Who ever said life was fair?  It isn't, as I recently have been made aware of.  The very hard way.  But, you know, God, being the generous, loving God he is, could at least make life fair.  And, has anyone bothered to ponder how someone such as God could ever send anyone to Hell?  Doesn't that seem kind of cruel?  Oh well, I suppose God has his reasons that we won't ever know.  It would be nice if we did though...  Is anyone afraid to die?  I, for one, am not.  The only thing I fear is the judgement.  What would happen if I was not good enough, and I was sent to Hell.  Purgatory isn't something I would really mind going to, if I can get to heaven someday.  But, Hell is it.  If you're sent there, you're stuck there.  Forever.  Scary, isn't it... also, it's like virtually impossible to get to heaven on your first try, isn't it?  I mean, unless you are killed walking out of a confession where you confessed ever single one of your sins, you are going to end up going to purgatory, at least for a little while, right?  Does that tell you something about our world?  How the world we live in is basically going to Hell.  Everything the media and Hollywood projects is based around sin.  How many GOOD movies have you seen lately.  Besides "G" movies and The Passion, I doubt if there were many.  OMG, Michael!! Who ever thought the moon was made of cheese? Like, seriously! LOL  That's all! Bye everyone!  ~JACK SPARROW~
