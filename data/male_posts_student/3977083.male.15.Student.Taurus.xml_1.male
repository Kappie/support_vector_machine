Theseare my natural curls!" In not so many words. They said that it was cute though. We weren't late today, but just on time. We even managed to acquire a cushioned pew. I was very pleased. When we got home, I finally remembered to email my Easter talk to Sister Pheysey. She's been begging me for months. I really am not sure of why my talk impressed so many people so much. They're still complimenting me about it. Oh well, Mine is not to wonder why, mine is but to do and die. After a few events that I admit I may have overreacted in, I am now forced to think of and participate in an activity with  urlLink  Almond  . I think I may be able to avoid it, but if not, oh well, it can't be too bad. I practiced for nearly an hour. A lot of it was improv, but hey. There are some times when you CAN serve two masters. My mother and myself. Well, in the background, I can hear my mother hinting about how much she dislikes my situation, and how she wishes I was like any other child.  urlLink  *sigh*   Life is just a package stuffed with foam peanuts. You have to sift through the annoying to find the enjoyable, and sometimes you just have to make do with the bubblewrap at the bottom. I read some from Fellowship of the Ring. I wish I could read faster. I really need to buckle down and just read the thing. Oh, I got emails today. Yesterday I just decided to tell    urlLink   Van Tan      the truth that I don't like him, and never have, but that I really don't want to lose such a good friend. He wrote back saying that he actually hadn't been avoiding me, just that he'd been busy. I just decided to believe him. He also assured me that we were still friends, which made me glad.     Anyway, 2 of the other emails were from    urlLink   The Radish     , telling me about hisfamily reunionin CA, as well as congratulating me about telling Van Tan the truth. The last email was from  urlLink  The Watermelon  ; it wasabout my confession as well. She also wanted to know exactly what the truth was. I told her that the truth was that I never liked him, and that I'm a dork. Well, that pretty much covers my day.
