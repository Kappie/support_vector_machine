Well it went something like this the dream that is: [mark falls asleep and tosses and turns as usual, ending up in a 'ball', dream starts] I was in my house, well not this house but my future house, with my wife. We were on the bed, don't ask what we were doing, i';ll let you decided that ;), then we moved and well is aw her face and she was very very very nice, then it went to a couple of moths later on and we had, had about two or three kids. [dream ends] Damn me waking up at that point, i was enjoying the dream as well!! I know its a dodgy dream but hey its  my  dream what do you expect!
