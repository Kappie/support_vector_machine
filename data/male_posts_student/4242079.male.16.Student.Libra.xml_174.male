And since, the trend has continued. I haven't thought about her in quite some time, and there is absolutely not reason at all that she should be in my mind, and yet she appears. Last night at a picnic table downtown. Is it perhaps that I never should have let her go, or for once in my life I actually did the right thing?    Last night. Went out with Robyn. Nice girl. First off, we went to dinner at the Mongolie Grill. I seem to have aquired a certain amount of celebrity (although not the kind most people like), as when I walked in, the girl at the counter's eyes light up and she loudly proclaimed "You're RadioShack guy!". It made me chuckle. "Yes, I suppose I am". The food there, oh my God. If you have not eaten there yet (as I'm assuming is the case for most of you), GO THERE NOW!. Expensive, but well worth it.  A walk in the park followed. There's nothing like a walk in the park to get to know someone better.  We ended up seeing "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen". I quite enjoyed it, Robyn didn't know quite what to think. All the heroes I looked up to as a 12 year old with a love for books. Tom Sawyer, Skinner, Dr. Jekyll, all thrown into one fantastic movie. Must buy.  The movie was over and we still had some time before she had to go home, so we had a campfire in the park. I love campfires and I love the dark and I love parks. I had a wonderful time. Sigh.  And now. RadioShack Guy must go to work.
