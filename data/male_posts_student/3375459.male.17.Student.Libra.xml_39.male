It must be the big crash yesterday that made Baby T gone crazy, or could it be that I was in too deep a sleep to notice the alarm going off. I certainly hope its probably me in too deep a sleep, cause I  cant bear too see my Baby T dying at this young an age.   Even so, I woke up just in time to freshen up and headed straight down to Boon Keng MRT station to meet up with the guys (Amos, Kah Loong and Kenneth Lim). We were supposed to meet up and head on down to P.S. to catch Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban together, but we had to leave without Amos because he only woke up after I gave him a call from the station. Onboard the train, we talked about Kah Loongs new phone plans and of cause his new phone as well. He got himself a Nokia 7250i (teal in colour), which I thought looked really slick. I love like his phone a lot, but Im truly happy with Baby T. Theres this one feature in Kah Loongs phone which I think most singlish speaking Singaporeans should understand, thats right a   L  adio, Kah Loong said. This reminds me of LiLings joke, which animal can you find in Singapore and starts with the alphabet L? The answer to that would be   L  abbit. Cold huh? Well, thats how the joke was meant to be.   Once we got out of the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station, we took the lift to the seventh floor of P.S. where Desmond was already waiting. Amos and LiLing came shortly after. Since it was still early to enter the theater, we went for a little morning window shopping. The only setback of going window shopping so early in the morning was that, we would just be looking at closed doors. We were merely riding down the escalator and elevating in the lift just to kill some time. Back at the seventh floor, we stocked up on snacks and combos before entering. For the very first time, instead of sitting in a row like we always do, we were divided into 2 row one behind the other. This is a better layout for conversation.  The movie was great; I believe anyone would enjoy it very much. After the movie, we went down to B1 in search of a place to eat. We made a detour and wandered off into Action city, where I had no luck finding those One Piece and Doraemon figurines. We decided to eat at Sim Lim Square as B1 was kind of packed. We passed by Sunshine Plaza with more figurine shops, to get to Sim Lim Square. Sad to say, all those figurine shops were closed for lunch. After lunch, we made our way into Sim Lim Square to get Desmonds graphic card and also LiLings speaker. We were roaming the place for up to an hour before everything was bought. I came out empty handed, but I was home with lots of fliers.    It was late afternoon when I set foot inside my house, so I turned on this computer and stoned while downloading animes. Then came my teacher who corrected each and every one of my blog entries, after watching Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone on the television. I think shes bore of checking for my mistakes already, so its up to me to keep my language as perfect as possible. I must do it, I can do it! Cheer on! Though Ive got a pretty bad hunch that this particular entry has got more mistakes then I can ever imagine. Thinking back on essay writing, it was always the best to write to the minimum words required. The logic is that the lesser one writes the lesser mistakes one would make. This online English teacher of mine is good at teasing people too, some trait passed down by her sister I guess. Should I be happy or sad when I got teased? I was getting a pretty sour feeling then, I still think its best to forget about it. Now, I cant even tell if Im dumb or just plan old thick skin.  Till the end of today (12 am), I was still blogging and chatting. That explains why I can blog for hours just for this single entry, right?
