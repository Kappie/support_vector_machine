If we could come up with a cool logo or somethings, perhaps we could create something cool to wear.  That's step one.  The second step, and surprisingly a big one, we have to learn how to fight! Now of course Luke and Edgar are way ahead of the curve, but it's time for the rest of us to step it up and start learning the goods.  Joe and I are gonna be at class on Saturday.  Gerrit is talking about returning.  Ruben's got the whole kickboxing thing working in Pasadena.  Adrian and Al....it's time to decide.  Are you with us?  Come on buddies...come on buddies....
