Please bear with me - and if you don't want to bear with me, then go and bear somewhere else; although please remember there are laws against such actions.  So, an entry to post here, eh ? I used to have a blog, you know. It was nice. Sort of like this, only plainer. And it didn't have my picture at the top of the page, which Mr Battrick, the creator of this small piece of the web, has kindly done. This is sort of a trial entry for me, so we'll see how it goes.  I'll tell you a little about my day, that shouldn't be too bad. I'll liven it up a little, hopefully you might find it vaguely interesting. I awoke to the sound of birdsong, which was nice, and the sun streaming through my curtains ... that's the poetic bit, you see, so this becomes almost like a novel. I've spent most of the day writing some French coursework, which is quite time consuming. I managed to spend half an hour looking for a quote, and failing to find it ultimately. Ah well, I could have done far less productive things, such as ... dunno, daydreaming ? Although that is undeniably fun.   And now I'm upto the stage in the workload where I'm writing about "Art Deco – it’s influence on transport – 1925-1939". Can you think of a topic that could be more exciting than that ?! Most likely. But I shall carry on, regardless of boredom level, until it's concluded in a manner that would make a soap-opera writer quake in their boots (at the thought of a conclusion ... as they don't have them ... soaps, that is, not the writers ... it just wouldn't do to have immortal soap writers, would it ?).   Right, I think I had better go back to writing about the Normandie, the Bremen, the Europe, and whatever else was floating in the 1930s.   Until our next meeting, au'voir !
