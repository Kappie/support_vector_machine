The fans cheered wif great applause~ surprisingly,ashafie was called wiliam hung~ haha~ guez he's small n fair~ haha~ aniwae, the penalty shootout was nerve-racking~ hamdani,dzaki and ashafie failed to convert the penalty kicks but eventually we prevailed we've goals from anwar,ansar n the winning goal from nabil as the opposition eventually buckled~ woohoo~ we r in the qualifiers~!!!  i hope the text juz now wasnt too long...well,nxt i guez wud be my firz training wif pasirian~ it has to be the moz nervous dae i ever had~ on the wae there,i met up wif my fren who told me abt those wonderful stuff those pasirians cud do~ i was so nervous i didnt even wanna step into the hall~ luckily, i cud muster up enuf courage to enter the hall n watch their warm up~ their passing was superb~ shooting brilliant~ it was fantastic~ it was such a joy to watch~ i'm nuting compared to them~ it also came to my realisation tat we from sp are nuting sia~ we reallie nid a coach to address tiz problem fast~ aniwae,on my firz trg match,3 on 3,very embarassing sia~ headed on to a high pass which resulted into a penalty~ kena lobang abt 3 tymz~ very de malu sehz~ my passing was damn fast oso,mcm shooting sak~ very different from the rough ground at skewl~ sum more i so kan chiong n nervous~ wah lao~ feel lyk restarting sia! haha~ aniwae,i'll be back for more man! i'm gonna learn from these batch of floorball players n improve myself more~ Tiz iz my goal!
