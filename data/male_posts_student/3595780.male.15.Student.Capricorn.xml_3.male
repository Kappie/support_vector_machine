Yes, it's a very deep ethical question that delves right down into the annals of time for it's answer.  We'll begin by looking at The Endangered Species Act of 1973 that makes it illegal for Americans to import or trade in any product made from an endangered or threatened species unless it is used for an approved scientific purpose or to enhance the survival of the species. Also, the endangered species on this list cannot be hunted, killed, collected or injured in the United States. Um, who cares So, since one is being harmed in the process of the above said question we must therefore kill it and roast it over a fire. And thats when i discover that the plant was poisonous so I must therefore kill the plant because it was harming the animal eating which was endangered. So, in answer to the above question: We must kill the animal, and if the plant is poisonous we must also kill it due to the fact that they are harming one or both species.  urlLink My Hompage
