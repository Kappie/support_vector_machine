I feel better guys, thanks for all the support, but most important...was your presence with me today,  you .   I rushed off to Raffles Place this morning for the outing with my Photography Club members. I have to admit this, I felt so intimidated by those present when they seemed to know almost everything about photography, about the equipment and basically, almost everything. And me? I felt like I didn't know anything at all, man I remember how terrible it feels to be low on confidence. But a little confidence goes a long way, I'm gonna keep going (: I believe I took some good shots after I took some time to settle in, but well...I believe i'll know how to take better shots soon (:   I didn't have breakfast at all in the morning, but the good news was that I was meeting my baby at City Hall at noon! -grins-   It feels so good to have my arms around your waist, fingers intertwined, and feeling happy again. I smiled, for once I smiled for real. Both  You  I had a great day -smiles-   My parents went for the movie "Brotherhood" heh, i'm so glad they found time to relax on their own.   I got into a little squabble with my 2nd sis, but well I won't talk much about it, things are getting better, that's good enough.   About my wallet, even though it means so much to me, if I really do not get it back, i'll learn to let it go.   Baby, I'm not giving up on our dreams, I wish you knew how much your laughter and smiles meant to me.   HAPPINESS -winks-    "A love letter waiting to be written,    a story of love waiting to be told.    A touch of a hand waiting to be felt,    a tear on the cheek waiting to be wiped.    The heart of a soul waiting to be entered,    the key to that soul waiting to be used."        -The Key         You were with me today, man nothing could feel better            I love you
