It seems the Leftists' plan to defeat Bush is to make him out to be an even bigger liar than their man. How pathetic. They cannot debate the issues, they cannot offer solutions to any problems, so they must denigrate their opposition.  How will electing John Fing Kerry help the country? Why should we try to get back at Bush if he lied? If we take recent history as an example to follow, then Bush should be praised for his adroit telling of falsehoods just as Bill Clinton was. After all, he only comitted perjury and made a mockery of the office of the President. I can hear it now, though. "Bush killed 500 Americans and thousands of Iraqis for a Lie!"  The knowledge at the time led us to believe that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Saddam lied! He wanted us to believe it. If it wasn't true, then he should have proven it. But he decided to call our bluff. How should we have reacted then? Should we have backed down and shown ourselves weaker than some thug running a third-rate country? When Saddam refused to fully cooperate, he had to be attacked. Our credibility and position were at stake.  Five hundred Americans is a high price to pay for victory. And the price hasn't been paid in full. But what was the price of failure? Who can say what a defiant Saddam would be up to today? With the War on Terror in full swing, Iraq could have sheltered countless enemies of the U.S. Syria and Iran no doubt are doing that very thing right now. But Saddam and Iraq are not, and that is a good thing.  There were intelligence failures over Iraq. But the enemies of America would paint that as a reason to attack the CIA. I see it as a reason to strengthen it. The CIA is a necessary tool in our defense. The world is a terrible place, and we must be constantly vigilant for danger. Assasinations, bribery, threats, and all manner of distasteful things must be done to keep our citizens safe. The projection of our power is the best way to ensure our safety and prosperity. Those who oppose that oppose our nation. By all means let a probe commence. But the results should spur a building up of the intelligence angencies, not a tearing down. It is obvious they were hamstrung by the previous administration. With our new focus on global terror it is imperative we restore our CIA as something to be feared by our enemies.  Look at this crap: "Questions about Bush's use of prewar intelligence, in addition to feeding doubts about his honesty, have sent his performance rating plummeting. Fifty percent of Americans approve of the job he is doing, the lowest level of his presidency in Post-ABC polling and down 8 percentage points from January. The survey found that, for the first time since the war ended, less than half of Americans -- 48 percent -- believe the war was worth fighting, down 8 points from last month. Fifty percent said the war was not worth it. "  I sometimes wonder if America is worth defending at all. It seems that every other person I meet thinks it isn't. I don't believe that we should have fought the war to bring Democracy to the Middle East. I think they are not ready. But we should have fought it to topple Saddam. And to show the world that we mean business. This threat of violence has already brought results. Libya is trying to get in our good graces. That's progress, folks!  These poll numbers really only describe the stupidity of Americans. Both their socialist leanings towards the Democratic Party and their gullibility to the mainstream media are apparent in these numbers.   "These doubts have affected Bush's reelection prospects. In a head-to-head matchup, Kerry beat Bush, 52 percent to 43, percent among registered voters. Bush had more passionate support -- 83 percent of his backers said their support was strong, while 59 percent of Kerry supporters said so -- and retains an advantage over Kerry in dealing with Iraq and the war on terrorism. But the Democrat was seen as better able to handle the economy and jobs, education, and health care -- all top issues with voters this year. "  Kerry's supporters only use him as a surrogate to defeat Bush. Notice that all the three "top issues" are basically handouts. People want the Federal Government to hand them a easy job for life. They want the Federal Government to give them a free ticket to college. They want the Federal Government to give them free cradle to grave healthcare. All of this is of course piad for by theft! Kerry's slogan should be "Vote for me, I'll steal from your neighbor!" Not that Bush has done any better with his "Compassionate Conservatism." His new entitlements alone do far more damage to our future than anything since Medicare. But at least he can lead us in the fight on global terror. The Democrats may be able to as well, but if you believe their rhetoric they would have never gone into Iraq. They seem to think weakness is strength. Do you want that in charge of our national defense?  I want you to forget the idea that anyone else should provide for your job, your education, or your healthcare. Do you want to be a dog? Becuase a dog just wants a kind master. A dog wants the same things most Americans seem to want. A dog cannot provide those things for itself, but a man can. Stand up for yourselves and stop stealing from your fellow citizens to provide for your wants.
