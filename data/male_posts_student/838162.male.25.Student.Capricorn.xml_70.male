Still looking into new hosting options and other blogging tools. Should I consider Blogger Pro? Or go for the web host and use Movable type? Also came across a new blog host/tool site TypePad. It looks very interesting, especially the photolog services.    >   Here are some links and reviews that I have come across recently.   Computers  Lots of news of the MSBlast virus going around. Wasn’t effected since I patch my windows often and have firewalls, e-mail virus guard and spam killer all standing by.    urlLink ZoneAlarm  and  urlLink Kerio  Two free firewalls out on the market. Although they may not be all powerful, it sure beats surfing naked through the Net. Learning curve on how to configure them may be abit high but once done, it becomes much less a nuance.   urlLink Pacific Internet Spam Guard  One of my local ISP’s new offering. Frankly speaking, I think all ISPs should integrate some form of spam filter for their customers, and not charge for it too. But it’s good to see the first steps taken over here.  urlLink  Mail Washer   Interesting little program. Checks your mail for you and shows you what could be spam based on a constantly updated list. And with a single click, you can blacklist other addresses that slip through. Once all the mail have been filtered, then only the “real” ones will be downloaded to your mail reader. Cute. Highly recommended.   urlLink Avant Browser  Combines the best of Mozilla and Internet Explorer. Makes surfing much faster and easier since it’s able to juggle many different windows at the same time. I would use it full time if it weren’t for one major bug. Still do give it a try. It’s free after all.   Entertainment   urlLink Television Without Pity  Funny website that does totally critical reviews of the latest television shows. Very useful if you miss an episode of your favorite show and want to catch up on what happened.   urlLink MegaTokyo  My latest webcomic craze. Beats out all expectations one would have gathered from other webcomics. Beautiful art and a truly multi-layered plot with romance, action and lots of humor that doesn't try to go for the joke of the day tactic. Only fans of anime and gamers need apply and please read the archives or be totally lost.  First site to beat the three link limit in the sidebar.    urlLink Megapixel.net  One of the first websites I came across while doing research on digital photography and what camera I should buy. Lots of breathtaking photos and in depth reviews of the not so latest cameras.   urlLink Friendster  The latest Internet fad, since the time of when ICQ first came out and the “six degrees of Kevin Bacon”. In fact, friendster is mainly popular because it combines the two together. Worth checking out and if so, do drop me a message :)  Lastly, I cleaned up and updated the link and information in the side bar. Take a look around. More updates soon.
