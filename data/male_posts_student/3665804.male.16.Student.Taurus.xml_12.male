Here's what I thought of them:  Bubble Gum Crisis episode 1: I didn't really like this one, the main character(as far as I know) just gets on my nerves and I don't know why.  But I will probably see the rest of the series, this just felt like that one episode of your favorite show you just don't like.  Darkside Blues: Now this was a good one, a little gothic, but still pretty good.  The ending could have been done better, or maybe they were setting it up for a sequel because it's like the movie has no ending.  And I still have no clue who that skinny kid-like guy is, he only says one word throughout the movie and it seems like everyone knows him.  Kai Doh Maru: Okay this one sucked.  It was good at first but the ending made no sense to me what so ever.  Not that I didn't know what was happening, it just made no sense what the characters were doing.  I mean, I still know nothing of the bad guys motive, the chick in love with the main character killed her friends, the main character just kinda sat there while what's-her-face tells her she killed them(basically) while she does nothing(I woulda ripped the bitch's head off, then gone to save my friends.  Maybe that didn't occur to her.) If someone could explain it to me, I would like it more.  Everything about the movie but the end was good.  3x3 Eyes part 2: This I still don't have an opinion.  It was too short to know if I like it or don't but I definitely want to see more of this series.  Demon City: Shinjuku: Just in case the rest were crap like the last few times I decided to rent a new anime series, I got this.  The only problem I have with it is that "fuck" is the regular adjective.  But this is one of the better anime movies out there.
