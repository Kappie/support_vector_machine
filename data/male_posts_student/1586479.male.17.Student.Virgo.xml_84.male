Yesterday I met Mary Kate for coffee (even though I don't drink coffee... ironic, eh?) and then went to play dodge-ball with a bunch of North Westenerers (you know what I mean). That was oodles of fun. Except that my arm still hurts from throwing and there is a slight chance that I may never have any kids (ouchies).  Without the pretty pink ribbon, you'd end up just like me.  So I'm going to be out of town for the next three weeks doing various things. It'll be a perfect time to try out posting from my cell phone. And catch up on my writing.  I have yet to find a suitable purpose for the little book Katy gave to me. It's a really cool book, so i don't want to ruin with crap, but I also don't want to have it sitting there forever blank.  I saw a cool book called "Off Ramp" at border's. It's a guy who wrote a bunch of essays while traveling across the country through back-roads and non-metro America. It seems like it would be an enjoyable read.  Aaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.......
