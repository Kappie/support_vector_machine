I will miss Zeigenbock.  There is a store here called Woodman's.  It houses more beer than I have ever seen in one place in my life.  It's kind of like a little slice of heaven.  I'm going to struggle to get used to the liquor in the grocery store thing.  That's different than both Fayetteville and Austin.  Be strong.
