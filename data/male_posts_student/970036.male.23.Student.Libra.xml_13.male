My inner-clock, my circadian cycle, is still 12 hours opposite of what it should be, even two months after being back in school.  *eyes the clock wishing he'd been asleep four hours ago*  Well, I guess it is giving me ample time to catch up on my reading. I've read seven books in the  urlLink Dune  series...only two more to go.    Currently listening to: Kill Bill Soundtrack (Japanese version)
