I slept until noon, watched a whole disc of FRIENDS episodes, went to rehearse a sketch for an hour, bought a few groceries, and then came home.  NO WORK INVOLVED!   7:45pm  I’ve really been enjoying my time here… well, for the most part.  I’ve not been miserable by any means, just been losing sleep.  I’ve met some really cool people and I’ve enjoyed visiting with some old friends.  I miss people and things back home, though.  Which brings me to a very scary thought.  What happens when I graduate?  Am I trying to hold on to school because I don’t want to leave my friends?  The comfort and assurance, the confidence and strength I’ve gained from these people is enough to get me through tomorrow, and knowing that I’ll see them soon, re-energizes all those things in me.  I want to be me, no matter where I am, and know that I have a support group of some sort to be there for me when I need it.   11:19pm  I meet all kinds of neat, fun, smart people.  People who I have a lot in common with (but not too much)…. But why with all these people can I not meet her?
