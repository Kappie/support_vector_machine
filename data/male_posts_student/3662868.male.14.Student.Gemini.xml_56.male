It took me from knowing nothing about football, and not caring, to loving football and knowing...some stuff.      Another game I got today was Rainbow Six 3 : Black Arrow. I wasn't so pleased with this game.   Anyways, to keep this post ending on a high note, I'll have reviews for both games sometime later.      I've been shopping a lot for my games and gear lately, and I've noticed that urlLink  Red vs Blue  has made a promo dvd to run in the demo xbox's at stores.   It's funny.  If you can ever hear it!  All of the stores have the volume turned wayy down on the xbox demos. But of course the pseww and gaycube demos are turned up more than loud enough to hear. "Ref, I'd like to challenge that play!"    So of course they want the psew and queercube to sell. Sure folks, complain about not having jobs and all the jobs being overseas. THE PROBLEM ARE THE ONES WHO ARE COMPLAINING! BUY AMERICAN BITCHES! XBOX IS AN AMERICAN BRAND! NOT PS2! Who cares if Bill Gates is a prick, his products are great! And you're probably already using some of his stuff, no matter how much you hate him.    How can you keep the jobs in America, if no one wants anything to do with them?   And if you are a ps2, or gamecube fan, and think my politics talk is going no where, just wait a second, shits commin your way too.   Just because Xbox is newer, and has better graphics, doesn't mean that yall have to be haters.    I don't hate gamecube because it has shitty games.   I hate it because it has shitty graphics and no internal memory.    And ps2 is just old.    Don't buy something and love it when you know you can go better.    The choice is simple.    Buy an xbox. Not a ps2. Not a gamecube.   Why stand the crappy graphics, or low memory?   And if you think the xbox has bad graphics, don't blame the xbox! Blame the developers!    In the gaming business, it's all about the money. And supposedly, whoever gets their games out the fastest will make the most money. WRONG! Crappy graphics on mediocre games don't rake in the cash.    Blockbuster hits with innovative gameplay and graphics keep the money train riding along for a good long time.   Look at Halo, it's sold over 1 million copies, and people are still buying it!   Either way you look at it, when Halo 2 comes out, it will own you all.    November 9th, 2004.   Are you in?
