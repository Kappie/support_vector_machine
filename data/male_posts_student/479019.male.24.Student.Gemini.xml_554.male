In 3 months I've seen 11 concerts. This summer I've seen Bad Religion, Alkaline Trio, One Man Army, the Vandals, AM Radio, the Circle Jerks, the Dropkick Murphys, Ozma, MTX, Phantom Planet, the Moving Units, the Muffs, Audio Karate, Rilo Kiley, and Rise Against.  There's been a lot of booze, fire, vomit, and blood - - in Vegas, the storage shed, Shooters, parties, etc. Last night we did some crazy shit with Descendent River at the shed.  This summer hasn't been without drama. That's something I won't revisit right now, but it certainly made things interesting the past 3 months.  My flight is at 10 PM... I'll be leaving for LAX probably in 3 hrs.  For all my peeps in Irvine / OC / LA / SD - - It's been a great summer. I'll miss you all.   Binghamton: Year 2 here I come.  ***
