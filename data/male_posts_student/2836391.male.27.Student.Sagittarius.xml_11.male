I've got a good group of people in my classes, with a wide range of ages and experiences, so it will be a good environment to learn in.  What is really encouraging is the number of guys training. This is a big problem in New Zealand schools, that there is a huge shortage of male teachers. It is really good to see so many guys starting training this year.  And, on an unrelated note, how cool is Lord Of The Rings?! Go Peter Jackson, go the Hobbits! And, as I commented to  urlLink Rachel  when watching the movie, the waistcoats were outstanding!
