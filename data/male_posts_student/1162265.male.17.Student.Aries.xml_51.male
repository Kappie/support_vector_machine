They questioned me, and made me lament over many things.  It was that night that I sat awaiting the voice of the Savior.  He came to me on the Third hour.  "Why do you lament in my namesake?" The Savior spoke to me.  "I fear many things of the flesh, when you only spoke of the spirit.  What of the old laws? The old ways?"  I questioned Him.  The Savior became silent, and I sat for another three hours in complete silence, until the Savior returned to me.  "You already know these answers.  Do not lie to yourself, and always know your own face." Upon hearing this, I grew confused and answered him in frustration.  "Lord, again, you speak of how to make myself strong in spirit, but how do I follow the laws of the temple?" The Savior left me again, and again for three hours I sat in silence.  The Savior returned to me.  "The Pharisees do not speak of your Temple, for God does not live in only one Temple."  With this the Savior dissappeared again.  I sat for three more hours, but this time the Savior did not need to return, for I realized that he'd never left.   I changed it to reflect a different feeling.
