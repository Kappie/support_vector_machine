By this, I don’t mean physically, but I mean love as a neighbor.  People on earth are faced with many things.  We must work to earn an income.  We must earn an income to buy food to eat.  We must buy food to eat so that we don’t die of starvation.  We are forced to do this in order to stay alive.  Meanwhile we are also faced with other things, not only physically but emotionally as well.  We all need to feel acceptance.  We all need to feel love.  We all need something.  You could not live in the middle of no where, isolated with no one to comfort you.  You would become extremely depressed.  You would go crazy.  The main problem in our current world is that the focus is put on us.  We are not concerned with one another, but with ourselves.  We are not asked to help anyone.  We are not forced to help anyone.  We are not obligated to donate a kidney if someone dying is in need of one.  In this country, you can deny someone their life by not giving them it.  No one in the United States could put you in jail.  No one could legally punish you.  Ethics, manners, the right thing, and morality are not enforced.  No one asks you to do what is right; they tell you do to what you want.  Thus making everything in your life optional and making everything ever more hard.  Nothing of morality is mandatory.  You just have to follow the law and not deny anyone their right to choose their options.  That in turn, is what makes the United States the United States.  We’re a huge country of diversity.  We’re also number one in crime and many other horrible statistics.  A country with so much freedom leads to a country with so many problems.  That is not to say that freedom means problems, it only leads to them.  We should have freedom; we should just use it in the right way.  The right way is not on the law books.  Therefore, anything goes.  I hope and pray this country will make a turn around.  We’ve seen some progress since the day of September 11, 2001.  Everyone has heard the story.  We know what happened.  I just pray that we’d all come together and do what’s right.  I don’t know how we can, but I just want the evil to stop.  I’ve had enough of it in my life as it is.  I’m sick of it.  I’m sick of the sarcastic remarks.  I’m sick of the mom jokes.  I’m sick of the drug dealers.  I’m sick of the rapists.  I’m sick of the murders.  I’m sick of the bad.  I’m sick of it, but the word hate will never come from my lips.  Fighting fire with fire doesn’t work.  If you’ve tried, you would know.  As you poor more flames on the fire, it elevates and devours anything in its path.  People as well.  Innocent people.  We need to do something.  I want this to be a better world.  Don’t you?  Do you want hate to continue?  Goodnight.
