I just got off the phone with a company here in Montreal that pumps volunteers full of drugs, takes blood, gives 'em cash, and sends 'em on their way.   Okay. I shouldn't be so vulgar. They are testing generic drugs versus name brand stuff. Sounds safe -- not like I'd be a guinea pig for anything radical. I'd have to stay overnight. One of the trials coming up is in late August. I would check-in Friday at 7:30pm and leave Monday morning. It's like sleep-away camp! They will take my blood 15 times during that time. And take urine samples. So I guess it's not like sleep-away camp. Which is fine, I hate camp. I figure I can get some homework done.   Oh yeah, did I mention that I will be paid $900 for "volunteering"? Booya.   Unfortunately I can't do it. I'm going to be out of town. They said I should call back when I return.   I met someone a few weeks ago who has been supporting himself for a long time doing this. He has characterized the experience as emotionally draining and degrading. But it pays his rent.   It's important to keep one's eye on the prize. I could finance a trip to Paris with my drug money. Christmas in Paris, by myself, crying over a bottle of wine? To be alone is one thing. To be alone in Paris is quite another. And I'll have track marks all over my arms, I could tell people I'm a junkie. Oh, the glamour!   If you think this is a bad idea now would be a good time to pipe up.
