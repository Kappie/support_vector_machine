I regret my anti-socialness i regret who and what i am I regret not trying harder, giving up so easily I regret my crap, how i didn't even know. I wish....so many things...  I'm sick because mentally i'm not there right now....mentally i wihas i was somewhere else i wish i was ....different...and i hope i achieve my damn goals, short and long term
