Short story shorter, I ended up going to the bar with Danielle and Ashlyn. I never realized how much I miss Danielle until last night. Her and I get along well enough. Guh. Came home, slept for a while, and went to work on my day off. *surprise, surprise*.    Saturday Night Vomit With Karin  Bryce and I were off at the same time on Saturday night. We started drinking around 7ish. We talked to one of his friends from Edmonton on MSN, and he decided that he should be there, so he came down here. By this time Bryce and I had invented a game. The game is to jump really high and let the ceiling fan hit you in the head. We headed out to the bar, and was pleasantly surprised to find KARIN HEHLI! She found me, eating a hotdog in an alley. My last post is a song I have been listening to a lot lately. It's how I feel these days. I had coffee with Crystal the other day, and I think I finally feel how I'm supposed to feel towards her. Instead of all sad and depressed about the fact that we broke up, I'm happy for the fact that I know her and that I had the chance to be a part of her life. That's how it's supposed to be. It's easier for everyone that way. At any rate. I also feel like I want a new girl. A girl like Karin.  NOT necessarily Karin  (circumstance has a funny way of fucking you over that way), but a girl like her. Someone that you feel comfortable with. And not comfort from familiarity, just plain old comfort, the kind where it doesn't matter if you've hardly seen the person in the past year, you can still be completely your self. The kind of person who will ditch her friends on the dance floor to stand by the door with you while you decide whether or not you're going to vomit up the hotdog you ate in the alley. Crystal was not like that, and though I did love her, I can see now what she saw. We weren't the people each other wanted us to be... ANYHOW, that's where I stand on that issue.   Sunday at the Shack  Sunday Morning, I went to work. Still a little drunk, i suppose. Work was work was work. Then it was time for inventory at the other RadioShack. Bryce's sister, Ashley was down for the day, and so she came with to help. I felt really sorry for her. Bryce had this big idea to go get drunk after, but since we didn't get out of there until 1 in the morning, it was a short lived period of drunkeness. Bryce and Jamie left for Jamies house, leaving Ashley and I alone. We talked for a while about religion and the such, and why or why not there is a God. We got bored. And you know what people do when they get bored......MAKE NOODLES!!! We made two packages of noodles in one bowl, and due to the fact that we can't even cook noodles proper, we only ate about three bits each and decided that was enough. Bed time it was. This morning came far too early.  Monday Night Sleep Now.  Ahhh...my own bed, for an entire night. Here I come....  nite, world.
