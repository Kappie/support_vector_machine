I saw  urlLink Harry Potter 3  yesterday and it was better the first time, for me at least. I was really upset because I wanted to see  urlLink the day after tomorrow  again. I saw it with my friend Sha a couple days ago and we both want to see it again. I was not expecting it to be as good as it was. What made it extra good was the one and only  Jake Gyllenhaal !!! I loved his character. *sighs... Another movie I want to see  again  is  urlLink spider-man 2 . I saw it opening day and have wanted to see it again ever since. I thought it was better then the first one, but that's just me. I had so many favorite parts, I don't even know where to start, so I won't...lol. I'm going to beg my parents to drive me to blockbuster so I can rent bubble boy. Everyone I have talked to say it's really funny. Wish me luck!!
