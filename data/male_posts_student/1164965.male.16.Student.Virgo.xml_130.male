I personally find the characters very realistic, especially Holden, I enjoy how the entire book is simply living the life of somebody who's our age, but engrossing simply because Salinger paints such an accurate portrait.  But I'm not hearing unanimous agreement from others, since people in my small group are finding different views of the book.  But what's really on my mind isn't the catcher in the rye, for me it's the aftermath of the ISEF fair.  Aside from meeting kids who I'm sure will be extremely successful before they're 30, I saw a group of 4 of them on my favorite business commentator's show, Lou Dobbs, talking about their projects tonight.  I wish I could accomplish as much as they have already.  I'm having the hardest time finding a good idea which real practical applications.  Getting started is always hardest but I digress.  I just feel like there is so much any of us could be accomplishing and I hate feeling like a sponge.  But there's always next year!  Or this summer I should say!  -Read a real newspaper, go to www.nytimes.com
