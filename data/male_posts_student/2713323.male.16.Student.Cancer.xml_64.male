Yep, i'm watching Bowling for Columbine for the second time now, even though my dad said it was dull, and i could tell by kel's expression that he was a little bored watching it. I don't know, but i kinda like that show, its not the usual films i'd usually watch, something knew. Hmm...i went to kels house today, didnt watch Shrek again like i planned to. I REALLY WANNA GO WATCH THAT SHOW! but too bad you guys are having your Os next mon. Ah shit. The mood has just died out, i dont feel like blogging anymore. God dammit i hate this. BLEAH.
