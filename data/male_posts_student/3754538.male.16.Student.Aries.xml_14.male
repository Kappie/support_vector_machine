By the time i'm really angry about some situation everyone else will be moving on and i'll be just ready to say something. Comebacks and retorts always come to me after-the-fact. I'll get worked up and want to yell at someone but if i do i'll sound ridiculous because the whole thing would be coming out late and my off timing would just annoy the person(s).            _______________________  Just trying to peg a name, to that feeling I get when I'm with you. (old poetry that never got expanded upon)            _______________________  Competition is for people unsure of their own standings and they need to beat people to build an identity for themselves. (don't immediatly assume i'm talking about sports or school, because i'm not)            _______________________  Self expression using a limited number of cuss words is an art. Few can paint masterpieces. Most butcher even their preschool fingerpainting equivalents. (i don't claim to be good at it, and don't always appreciate it)
