Every summer I always say that I'm going to do a whole lot of stuff, but (as expected) I maybe get about 1/10 of it done. Still in the middle of reading my two books for summer reading which hopefully I can get finished up by the week prior to school starting so I have a few days to review each of them. Anyone that knows me knows that reading comprehension isn't exactly an area where I excel in. Plot summary? Yes. Characters? Kinda. Style analysis and what the deeper meaning of lines 5-23 are? No.  For the past 4 nights (Tuesday-Friday), we've had Vacation Bible School at our church. Since my grandparents are the ministers, I of course get to help with  everything  that we do (food, singing, crafts, etc.). At least that's over with and I hold the unofficial veto power for any and all future years.   Ratchet and Clank  (the first one, not  Going Commando ) is my new favorite game. I'm about 2/3 to 3/4 done with it already, and next up on my list is the sequel. I'm trying to play and beatgames that have sequels (or simply more games coming out in the series) coming out this fall ( RC: Up Your Arsenal ,  Sly 2: Band of Thieves ,  Jak 3 , etc.) before the sequels come out. Then not to mention great games such as  Beyond Good and Evil ,  Metal Arms: Glitch in the System , and  Prince of Persia  that I still need to play. I wonder if 1 month if even enough...
