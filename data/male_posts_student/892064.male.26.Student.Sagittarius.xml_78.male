Ha!  Second of all, that bitch is going down!!!  Yeah.  If you don't know who I'm talking about, ask me.  :)  Woohoo.  Thirdly, Jeremy starts working at Target wednesday and I can't be there to witness his first day in a red shirt and khakis so everyone should go in my place!  And I'm now alone at Aalon :( so Jackie, I left you message and you should go fill out an app. and pretend like you don't know Jeremy.  Haha.    Fourth...I can't wait till Friday when El Paso will be taken over by the dynamic duo with a side of Chris.  I'm ex-super-cited!  Love, love, love from ME!
