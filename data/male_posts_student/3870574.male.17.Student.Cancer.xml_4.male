As the the most liberal Senator in the United States Senate, his voting records tells the American people what he does not want them to know. He stands for higher taxes; against the protection of pregnant women. (Laci Peterson Law) He is for sending our troops to Iraq but against giving them the proper equipment to fight the insurgents in Iraq. He is for the Patriot Act, and now he is against it. Why can't John Kerry tell the truth to the American people on the issues he stands for? Is he embarrassed of his voting record or does he not want to give the American people the whole story?       Secondly, when John Kerry spoke the Democratic National Convention, he was trying to display a more centrist, more moderate viewpoint. Clearly from the reactions in the crowd, the Democratic Party is far from being moderate. They cheered the most when John Kerry made his digs at the President and his cabinet. He pledged that "As president, that is my first pledge to you tonight: as president I will restore trust and credibility to the White House", only to go on to say, "I want to address these next words directly to President Bush: In the weeks ahead, let's be optimists, not just opponents. Let's build unity in the American family, not angry division"      Furthermore, Kerry goes on to say:      "I will be a commander in chief who will never mislead us into war. I will have a vice president who will not conduct secret meetings with polluters to rewrite our environmental laws. I will have a secretary of defense who will listen to the best advice of the military leaders. And I will appoint an attorney general who will uphold the Constitution of the United States."          No angry division, Mr. Kerry? How can you, in the course of one speech, flip-flop on your statements? Especially in a speech of this magnitude? The President mislead us into war just as much as you did, Mr. Kerry, and unlike the Senator from Massachusetts, President Bush has a clear and concise view of what he plans to do to protect America. Bush states that he was tired playing defense and he wanted to go on the offensive on these terrorists. (Stated before the 9/11 attacks as chronicled by the 9/11 Commission Final Report.) Bush believes that to defend America we must bog the terrorists by making them move constantly so they cannot plot to murder Americans. President Bush believes that we should not have to get United Nations to get consent to protect our country. President Bush, as did John Edwards did at one point, believed that if we had to defend America without the help with some of our allies, that we will do so.      President Bush is proud of his faith, values and conservatism. John Kerry cannot decide if he is proud to be a liberal. He was a hawk at the beginning of the war. Prior to the re-invention convention, he had to adjust to a more anti-war stance to become the Democrats choice to run for President, and now, at the time where he speaks to the country, he comes to the center and tries to have it both ways. Mr. Kerry, it will not work. The American people see a straight shooter in President Bush. They see you as someone who says what is politically expedient. And in November, it will show as President Bush will have "four more years". For you Mr. Kerry, no "help is on the way".
