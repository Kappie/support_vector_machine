Well I ultimately take myself away from that when I don't MAKE time for God to be speaking something new to me.  I was so frustrated but happy with the results of last weeks practice. Frustrated because some people wouldn't shut their yappers but happy that I could play some pretty music (even if the band wasn't always backing me up like they should). I'm trying to be more direct with what I want to hear (without sounding like an overbearing ass). Jules kept saying "K.. K.. let's go already! Play something!" and after rummaging through the song files for half an hour, I wanted to throttle her. Felt like snapping back, "Well, why don't YOU go through some songs and pick something then!?" but I kept my mouth shut and just made some sort of odd exhaling noise.  We tried to get two of the songs rolling. I wasn't comfortable with the melodies or lyrics for either one. So it was discouraging to see both of my songs crash before they even got off the ground. But I'm not backing out, not backing down.. I'm going to keep writing, keep practicing these songs until they're drilled into my head. Hopefully, something good will come of this.
