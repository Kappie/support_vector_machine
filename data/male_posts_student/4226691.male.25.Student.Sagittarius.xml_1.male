Way back in High School, I began to read different holy books, the Zend-Avesta, the Tao te Ching, the Uspanishads, the Koran, the Ramayana, even a little Torah....and of course I read the entire Bible...I did go to Catholic school after all. But I always felt that Catholicism, and christianity in general, was a downright depressing religion, nothing worth celebrating, and nothing worth keeping. I went to confession once, and I told this old priest that I was having some doubts about my faith....and he yelled at me for five minutes about my wicked ways and such. but that didn't really destroy my faith, since some old luny man doesn't really make the end all and be all for me...no. My mom made us to go church every sunday, and I can't remember when, but I decided to look around at other people in the church. I do this from time to time, when I'm bored, and I start looking at other people, what they're doing, what are their facial expressions, and I wonder what they are thinking. Well, everyone in that church didn't look happy. They looked like they were going through the motions. Everything was scripted, and so it's easy to just have your refrain that you do every Sunday. I was screaming inside, "what's wrong with you people!" "Does being here really make you happy, with your empty rituals, refrains, songs, and dirges?" I knew what the answer was for me, and from that point forward, I vowed never to go to church again, unless it made my heart swell with joy and I was truly meant to be there....since that time, I have probably gone to church two or three times over the course of four years. This was usually due to baptisms and such. I have kept my vow, and I don't really see any end to it all. Now, I'm not really attacking anyone's religious beliefs, but I have been raised to question things. Why we do this and why we do that. I would hope that other people are doing the same thing...questioning at the very least. You don't have to have outright speculation, but at least be mindful of things and why you are the way you are. I guess if it gives comfort to people during times of crisis, then that's ok. But I have been through a lot of things in my life, and church/god has not given me any comfort. I guess that's kind of fucked up, but there you go. Faith is such a frustrating thing, putting your trust in some god, or in people for that matter. My faith is pretty low, though I know that I will always have hope. And I know in the back of my brain that what I have learned from 13 years of catholic school cannot be undone just like that. I still believe that Christ was some super-special being that was meant to help people. Was he god? maybe. Who knows?Still, religious belief is different then religion and its establishment. The Church, and sometimes its membership, has this view of controlling your actions and thoughts, which I find abhorrent. Christians, some of them anyway, can be the most judgemental people. They believe that they are these pious people who can do no wrong since they are in god's special graces. But I am sure that if you look deep enough, they have a bad track record somewhere, and they are just as dirty as the rest of us. The Church is this monstrosity that is old, decrepit, and callous to human suffering. It is an instrument of perversion of what Christ originally mandated. Of course, when I speak of the Church, I mean the big one in Rome, but I think all of the other denominations are simply derivatives of the original church. So, one doesn't believe in saints, or the other has women priests, or the other has some funky singing section....it's all the same basic structure, the same basic tenants, and the same fatal-flaws. Not that I am saying that Christians are not capable of good and beautiful things....look at the Cathedrals of Europe, the manuscripts of the middle ages, bingo. But with the good, comes the bad...the inquisition, religious strife between denominations in Ireland, and with other religions- like with Islam, the slaughter of tens of millions of people in the Americas---the church took part in that one, especially with the missions, the congregating of people- which spread diseases even faster, and the continued intolerance of people-especially women and homosexuals. If anyone reads this, and takes offense, I apologize for that. I'm just being honest and trying to work my thoughts in my head. But I do invite dialogue...if anyone wants to do so in a civil manner...I don't need the "you're going to burn in hell", or "the bible says this..." I know what the bible says thanks. I plan on writing a sequal blog to this, called "why I'm a pantheist," since I feel that I must explain my current belief structure, though it is also on shaky ground. later. E
