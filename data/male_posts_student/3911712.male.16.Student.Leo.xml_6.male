I miss her ever so much (she's in england at the moment, hope she's having fun, I havn't heard from her yet, she comes home on my birthday). When people call me "dust" (no, not the gray stuff, its notwegian for "moron") I think of her, she call's tells me I'm a moron whenever I say something she doesn't like, but I think she likes it a bit anyway, 'cause then she gets to call me moron. And when she call's me moron, its not that avrage "dust..", she sais it in *such* a cute way, it's more of a "dus-s-st), like shes saying it with her tounge up infront of her teeth ^_^. So now I no longer get offended when people call me moron, I get happy and start thinking of her :D.  2. I have now realised, I am as evil as all you other people, I too have something to hate. I am not as angelic as I once thought, I thought I was incapeable of hating.. I have been proven wrong. I  HATE , the end on wieners. You know, theres like "the wiener" and then theres "the wiener end", I'll draw it for you!        >(000000000) " and "   anyway, that's today for ya..
