I'm not very worried about it though.  I don't think people are jumping on it as a domain they can't wait to have.  But I still need to get it registered.  Anyways my computer's broke as well.  I'm not sure what's wrong with it really.  It just locks up when I boot.  I think it might be something to do with the drivers because I was installing some updated drivers for the webcam or something I don't remember and the thing locked up when I was installing it.  That probably screwed with the system files or something.  I don't know what I'm going to do.  I'll figure it out.  I'm tired, so good night, folks.
