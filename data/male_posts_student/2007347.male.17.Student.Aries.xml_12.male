Its so hard to argue this point of view, its illogical and fallacious. *sigh* looks like I'll never get into the Toastmasters club now...   I said that I'd tackle Male tendency to be stupid. But id also like to first look at a topic that Meg brought to my attension, which leads into several other issues.    Somewhere between Hamish's crimes against humanity, Kenji's pornos, and Tassos's plea for a return to our roots. Meg post a message that said something along the lines of "I need to get back into a relationship" I wish to highlight the word NEED.  NEED/ni:d/ v.   n -- v. Be under the necessity or obligation.    obligation, necessity, are very powerful words. Dare I say it, but 'need' in the sentence implies a requirement of existence to have a relationship.  the guys generally like, or want, or find it better to be in a relationship, but very few of us actually need a relationship.   Meg may have been saying it lightly but for many of the female form they Require a relationship in order to define what sort of person they are.    Its true isn't it? Some women latch onto a fella and use him to reflect how they are. "He's popular and strong and masterful, AND HE PICKED ME!!!!, im sooo cool" then, shes destoried when he fucks off, cause he can live on his own and she cant. Becuase HE knows who he is. He can love himself. (this time im not refering to jerking off) 8===========> The man is defined by his actions. The action defines a woman.   think of this very very carefully. lets take 2 groups which most people dont like. Jocks  sluts.  A jock loves the rugby A slut loves the cock but  a jock is truely defined by following the phillosphy of jockism. (stupidity at lunch, worship of sport, hate of nerds and intelligence) there are some rugby players that dont fit in the same catergory as Jocks in the true sense of the word.  but a slut is defined by actions, even just one action. of sexual activity. there is no doctrine and general attitude of sluts. at least not at the same Fascist drivings of Jockism. you can have goth sluts,  blonde bimbo sluts, minga sluts, etc. groups of entirely different people and different approaches to life.   Instead of using The action defining a woman. use principles to define the action. As a wise (and senile) man says "Stay True to youself"  --Tavis.  8===========> Note there has never been a matriachal-female civilization. Why?   is it the psychological nature of the cock  cunt? the exernal, outwards cock builds the psychology of expansionism. although the inward cunt has a psychology of self conciousness and containment.    that is one theory.   What ever happened to the Girl power idea? it was there and it just faded away. why? did men crush this rebellion, No. it fell apart on its own. everyone jokes about women controlling the world in one way or another. but is that really possible oweing to the dependaceny of ladies on gents?    YES YOU CAN JOKE, BUT ULTIMATELY YOU NEED MEN. 8==========> Men cant get away with anything rotton unless women let them. every conceviable transgression (crime, violence, sexism)! women have the ultimate power of sexual acceptance/dissaproval. Although women cant control male action they can control theirs most of which is tollerating the male behaviour to avoid loneliness, self-assertivness and self-sufficeny.  it makes sense doesnt it? tollerate a little bit of shit to get the guy, and youve got access to all the money this fella makes. Why isn't there females in high administrrative positions? BECAUSE THEY CANT BE BOTHERED!    Dont give me that Sexism in the workplace bullshit, theres rascism too, and still Curries, Gook, Fags, Wogs, Spicks, Pinkos, Hispanics, are getting to the top. Females love to cope out. give up, settle for less.   Guys wont do it BECAUSE OUR EGO WONT ALLOW IT. 8===============> Recap: we've covered alot today. Firstly, Male definition and female definition in society is ultimately different. Owing to the focusing on different aspects of the person Secondly, SOME Women lack the drive to truely excel. because they dont really know what they want. Thirdly, SOME women instead cling onto the males in order to define themselves as a person, and thereby allowing male stupidity to take place.  Fourthly, Man (usually) doesnt suffer from this because ultimately our ego gudies us in a direction. (not nesscerally good) Fifth: This doesnt apply to everyone.   Every guy deep down inside believes theyll change the world. "What we do in life echos in Eternity", a very masculine and egotistical statement.    Ladies get off your whiny, depressed and complaining asses AND CHANGE THE WORLD
