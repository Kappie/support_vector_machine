Warriors Blue will remain for my stories, if i ever finish them that is.   so what is Just Communication and what is Rhythm Emotion Pure?  both are the names of songs by the group TWO-MIX, i would have used Rhythm Emotion, but that was aparently already taken by someone else so oh well, i like Rhythm Emotion Pure better anyway, better song, even if the lyrics are the same.   so anyway, Just COmmunication will be for stuff like survey, quizess, and other freaky ness and this will actually be about me, if i remember to post on it, i might forget i have this new one, but oh well.   time is on i wanna spend my life, to get the reason why i'm so hot. look at me, there are no tears for fears now in my eyes  you made my mind brave and you made me find where to be with you, i'm ready for holding you so tight!  i just feel Rhythm Emotion,  i just feel light forever and more. only to be, i'm leading myself to a brighter way out, it's so far away!  i just feel Rhythm Emotion, i just feel love forever and more. only to you, i'm sending my heartbeat so far away!  time is now, i wanna risk my life, to get the reason why i'm so real. hear the voice, there is more story to tell with my heart.  won't leave the glory alone in the days you could see magic, i'm ready for dreaming on again!  i just feel Rhythm Emotion, i just feel warmth forever and more. only to share, i'm making myself to give everything in so many ways!  i just feel Rhythm Emotion, i just feel kiss forever and more. only to tell, i'm being for you, but so far away!  i just feel Rhythm Emotion,  i just feel light forever and more. only to be, i'm leading myself to a brighter way out, it's so far away!  i just feel Rhythm Emotion, i just feel love forever and more. only to you, i'm sending my heartbeat so far away!
