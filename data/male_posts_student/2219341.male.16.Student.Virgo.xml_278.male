L got served!  i can so play the Canon better than her!  lol!  i just got back... i did have a very nice night.  i felt kinda lonely for most of it though... even though i had all my friends around... it was just.. weird.  i think L could tell cuz she was bein overly nice to me... or maybe the fact that Ben was there put her in a really good mood... ill try and be positive and say she was just tryin to be nice to me... not that she's not nice ever.  she's just sarcastic and stuff alot with me... its really our joke... but it bothers me sometimes.  i guess it was nice to have a nice Ellen this night.  she's actually started to be nicer and less sarcastic lately.  i like it.  but yes... anyways.  Bailey was downstairs sittin next to me while i was playin the piano... but she kinda disappeared after awhile... i think she went upstairs... but i was wonderin where she had gone.  well... i think im off for now.  its late and like Claire said "church tomorrow!"  goodnight everyone.
