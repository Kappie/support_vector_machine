All i need to b actually is jus calm ya know, cuz sometimez when i play i jus freak out and i have to make everything perfect...so all i did was jus stay calm throughout this match. In the 1st game i had like a shit load of killz, it was insane, there were no big guyz on the other team so i jus pounded the spotz where no body was at, we won 25-20. Then in the 2nd game, we jus knew we had this game if we jus stayed calm, "calm" in the key word of this post...haha, and jus took to em. On one set, it looked like the ball was goin over but Tom set a 1 to me and i jus drilled the shit out of it, it was fuckin awesome...we won 25-9. The third game i think we got a little overconfident, but we knew we had it, so we jus won the last game 25-18. In the end, Tom got the tiki, i think he deserved it cuz w/o him, i wouldnt of had my 17 killz, so i was happy for him. So now, the focus in on the 2nd round, after the game i was jus like "yeah...1st round...on to the next." I jus have to keep that mentality, its not ova...its not ova...payce.
