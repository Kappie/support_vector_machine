He taught me an arabic scale called Hijaz, which is really interesting. I think he is an expert in Arabic music, he has been playing the Ud for thirteen years. I bought my new guitar today. It's shiny and red and a Stratocaster. I feel like Jimi Hendrix, just minus the ability to play the guitar! That'd mean I'm pretty fucking debilitated I guess;at leastI can learn. I now need to get an amp when I get back to England and some funky pedals and maybe an Ebow or something and then I can prog out, man! I just went to some kind of festivity in downtown San Jose, it was boring and borgeoise and the music sucked, although the band (named the Hitmen) had a singer who sounded similar to the Godfather of Soul. You could easily equate them with Jazz-Funk-Soul-Lite;Norah Jonesand Katie Melua mixed in with Prince, Kool and the Gang, the Isley Brothers, Miles Davies and James Brown all put in a blenderwith a good dose of shit-crowd pleasing cover versions. They did a good Jackson 5 cover, but that's about it.The upside of the eveninghowever, was that I met out neighbour's son, Paul who is a DJ and has played the Berlin Love Parade. He seems like a cool guy, he knows England quite well and lived in Manchester for a while, where he tells me he knew Elbow before they were famous. There were a lot of resiliently and agedly wealthy old white men, dancing like morons, which was nice. This was coupled with a load of newly welathy Tech-execs trying to keep up with the gentrified. I guess that's Sunnyvale for you, there are quite a lot of boring old snobs, maybe not as bad as Palo Alto, but still. At least there were some cool liberal people there, like a hippy woman that I bought a crystal pendant from for $8. Chuck, our neighbour, and I had a good chat about politics on the way back. I guess one of the advantages of this land of pigs in cages on antibiotics is that at least most of the people (around here, anyway, and especially people like my Dad and Chuck) are well edified, and so make fordecent conversation. Even the Republicans, dare I say it, seem to quite well-informed, so it makes for interesting discourse.  Speaking of politics, the Democratic convention is in course at the moment. Amongst the stolidand omnipresentTed Kennedy, the vivaciousJimmy Carter the vibrant (but a bit greyed)Mr and prospective-PresidentMrs Clinton, as well as the big surprise of the week, Ronald Reagan Jr speaking in favour of stem cell research legalisation, the highlight has thus far been the dynamic, rambunctious and frankly-pretty-damn-awesome Al Sharpton. The man was like an inferno, he was ablaze and scintillating to watch. He was a man of integrity and conviction and spoke eloquently regarding the iniquities of Washington DC having no representation in Congress, the maltreatment of latino immigrants. Some might describe him as a loose cannon, but I feel he was speaking his beliefs and was totally unpretentious in doing so. There was so much electricity in the room it could have lit up Boston, the entirety ofMasachussetsand most of the inaugural thirteen states. I'd be surprised if John "boring-git" Kerry or any of the latter-day speakers can top the Reverand. Anyway y'all, peace out, much love and stuff.   Mood: Annoyed at the irateness-inducing alphabet video my brother is watching.  Music: The Section - Paranoid Android (from the LP 'a string quartet tribute to Radiohead'); The Killers - Jenny was a friend of mine; Metallica - Master of Puppets (Live). All of which are interlaced with some stupid fucking alphabet nonesense. Quote of the Day:  "We never got our mule and our forty acres, so we rode this Donkey all the way here!" ~ Reverand Al Sharpton  "If you're not liberal when you're young you have no heart, if you're not conservative when you're older you have no brain" ~ Winston Churchill
