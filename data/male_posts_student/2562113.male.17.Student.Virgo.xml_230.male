Bar fights, thefts, stripping, crazy bus/taxi rides, and extremely drunk people. Good shit. That's what makes Albany so great; you never know what to expect when you mix alcohol, girls, and raging harmones together.  I was looking through the hit counter for this blog and I cannot help but point out the kind of search queries that this blog is getting. Here are some actual search queries for this blog:  "nrhs tits" "kid with downs wins the race even though he stood in place" "milf bryans hot mom" "thursday night is ladies night at college bars on long island" "blog bitch fight" "terd in my backseat" "around his neck gold medals hung hanging on his giant tongue" "why karen like to pull andrew%27s cock and accidentally kick andrew%27s cock"  Hmm...interesting to say the least.  Until next time,  -BIGsmut
