I'm writing this from work, cause no one is picking up the phone... pick up the phone baby... addicts of communication, addicts of communication... mmm... just had to bust out some  Randy  there. I'm gonna be going to the free AM Radio mini-show / CD signing later. AM Radio is alright, but overrated in my opinion. But free music, especially free live music is always a good thing. I need to pick up some goodies for Steff, and I want to meet up with some boardies. I'm not sure if I was amused or not when Steff said "no alcohol tonight" when she thought she could go.  Woohoo BBQ on Friday and Vandals on Saturday. It should be another fun filled week.  ***
