Then My brother met us there at the hotel Santa Marina and we put our stuff in our room and immediately left for exploration. My brother was quite the map looker so he led us everywhere. We saw lots of scultures and a lot of Pigeons so many is it was freaky because there were people there that actually sold like dried corn to give to the pigeons. Were were very close to a piazza and there were lots of churches and bell towers there. We went to Murano and Burano, Murano very well know for the glass blowing there and Burano for Lace. We stayed in Venice for 3 or 4 days then went to Rome. We had a private tour of just our family to Nero's Palace, Colloseum, and Roman Forum, all very nice places. We got there and we hiked around a lot then went back to our Hotel to find out that the air conditioning was always turned off after 6 CHEAP BASTARDS! and the streets were so noisey. and the rooms were very small. We saw everything that Rome had to offer the fountains like the Trevy Fountain and the other Obelisks and churches that were around the city. Since our family had read the book "Angels  Demons" which is a mystery book and it takes place in Rome so we had a "Angels and Demons" tour that we did ourselves. After our 3 days in Rome we went to Lucca, we went to Quico Terra (5 villages) and we hiked 4 of them which was quite enough and went back to out hotel we stayed in Lucca for 2 days. Then we went to Florence which is where my brother had been studying for the past 3 months. He led us to every big church sculpture garden, museum, painting, and piazza, forum anything you could think of we tried to try. We were in Florence for 4 days then took the train to Prague, The train to Vienna was 12 hours overnight train now the train is like sleeping in a damn submarine you get llike a 5' x 1' square of heaven all for yourself and you can't move for else you could fall. then we got to the train station in Vienna, and waited for an hour and took the train from Vienna to Prague and met our relatives at the station, the train ride was 5 hours. Inca was the women and her son Michael who was in his 30- 40's and was a very successful dubbing director, he took American movies and dubbed then into Czech. He had the coolest surround sound - Home Entertainment center ever! Adam Turned 21 on the 19th a day before Father's Day. we saw the oldest Synogogue in the World, yes it even beats out the ones in Israel. We enjoyed a good 4 days in Prague and it's sites and places then we came home. If you would like anymore information about my trip please set up an appointment or IM me. Many of you have presants waiting for opening!
