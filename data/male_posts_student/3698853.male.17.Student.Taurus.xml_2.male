But I know I could have done so much better. I've turned into a slacker, and that makes me angry. YES! I realize it's my own fault, and I don't expect pity, and I don't pity myself. I want to incite change! Some people just like to think I'm crying over spilled milk. Well, guess what? this isn't farking spilled milk! Grades might not mean anything one hundred, fifty, or even ten years from now, but right now, grades are the only thing I have and the only thing that can help me make something out of my mess! Everyone has  their  thing. I don't even know what mine is yet, and when I do realize what that "thing" is, I wanna be frickin' prepared. Is that so much to ask? doG almighty! Yeah it sounds selfish, but what of it? I want to lead a regular life, just like and maybe even less than anyone else. There are so many things about me that work to prevent that... Gah! and when people complain to me about my conduct, all they're really doing is feeling sorry for themselves, and it makes me SICK! _I don't normally get angry with anyone, and usually the anger will pass rather quickly. But I can't stand always being angry like this. It shouldn't happen on a weekly basis. Up and Down like I'm on frickin' drugs or estrogen. NO! I really don't need that; it's unnecessary. I shouldn't  have  to explain myself, everytime a person takes what I say out of context. Hell, I say nebulous things all the time. Frankly, I don't give a sh*t anymore. People can kiss my @$$. Every time I try to make an effort to ameliorate something, they just spit it in my face and childishly give me the cold shoulder. I don't mind talking things over, because it gets sh*t done. _So what if I'm self-conscious and worried about my grades? If you think it's wrong of me, then maybe you don't place enough emphasis on them. Yeah, that was bitter! no apologies! You think it's sOOooO easy to be me. You think ALL I do is just sit around and slack off. uh-huh, yeah, sure, you believe what you want. I  do  get things done once in a while, and I make an earnest effort. I may not put out that much, but it's the best I can give. With each year, the tiredness just accumulates. The stress, the anxiety, the frustration. I hate to sound like a stereotypical, angst-filled teen, but people DON'T understand me. And don't think that you do, because you can hardly begin to comprehend. I know myself. Yeah, I'm pretty f***ed up....
