I don’t understand why people complain about not being able to get a job.  They’re everywhere, it’s like they grow on trees, I myself have 2, and oh many of you will never understand the simple joy of having more money then anyone else.  And no I’m not one of those snobby rich kids whose parents give them everything thing they want…like a car…I think those people should be shot. Me, I’m one of those honest working shmoes that busts his ass trying to make a lot of money, possibly to go to Greece during spring break.  And while I can sympathize with people who don’t want to work in fast food place (I’m one the people who doesn’t want to, incase you can’t tell) sometimes you got to suck it up and go with the flow.  But yes, I guess the whole point of this is to say that I’m stinking rich and loving it!!!!!  But just a tip to all of you who have large sums of money, always lend to your friends because you never know when that one time that you’ll be short on cash will come up, and if you are greedy you can probably expect the same thing back.   -Matt
