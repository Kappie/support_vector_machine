There's a thread on the Princeton Review law school discussion board where a hiring partner at a top firm is taking questions and giving his answers.  He responded to one person that he Googles everyone before he interviews them.  I'm sure there's at least a handful of lawyers who read this occasionally -- does the mere existence of my weblog put a real dent in my chances during the recruiting season?  Or does the fact that someone might find it entertaining balance the risk that someone else might see it as a negative?  At this point I'm merely curious.  Any thoughts, shoot me an  urlLink e-mail ...
