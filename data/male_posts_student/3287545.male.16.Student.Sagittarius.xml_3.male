    
       I just got home from doin my papers 20 minutes ago, and now I’m having my dinner. Just a mixture of stuff bunged on a plate. So, I was home 5 minutes and me phone was ringing – withheld it said, it picked it up they hung up. Again. The same thing happened yesterday at 4:17 and today it was 4:31 (just so I’ve got it noted somewhere). Something pretty big happened at school today, Katie kissed me, I say she kissed me cause it was her who did all the kissing not me. Not that there was much kissing it was a more of a brief cheek slap. Everyone’s being saying we should kiss for quite a while, but up until now she’s been to scarred and I’ve never really wanted to. So, were standing outside my tutor room, there weren’t many people around which I guess was strange seeing as it was absolutely poring down with rain (I had previously got very wet from running through it from youth club to tutor). So, yeah, we’re standing outside my tutor room, and then she has to go to her tutor, which is usually next door but there was some drama exam so her tutor group had been moved elsewhere. She dropped her bag throws her arms around me, I’m thinking, she’s going to kiss me I know it. We’ve been talking about it a lot recently you see, because everyone else is kinda havin a go. Then we pulled apart a little, made eye contact and then she waked her cheek against mine and made that kissing sound. Why do we (as humans) do that, there is no lip usage yet we still make a lip sucking/clicking/kissy sound – odd. Then she picked up her bags, and I picked up her plastic bag, think it had art work in it, and gave it to her. Then she literally ran off towards the door. I then walked towards the radiator, to dry up a little now that it was free, and she looked back seeing me doing a girly walk, which looked like a run towards her. I think she thought I was going after her, and that made her run faster. So, then I was doing a few rolls along the radiator in an attempt to dry up me soaking shirt, and got a crazy look from, oh, whats her name, errrr, oh god what is it [smacks head], Katie, of couse (but not gf Katie a different one in my tutor group). Then miss came along to unlock the tutor room doors and I did a girly walk from the radiator to the tutor room (which I quite enjoyed). I was a little lonesome (is that a word?) in tutor today. Amy and Elle weren’t there to start with, Chris went on the computer to play some game thing and Charlie (as in Charlotte) and Lara were standing the other side of the room by the heater, until they noticed me and came over. I still felt a bit left out though, cause they were talking amongst themselves about some secret thing. It really annoys me sometimes, cause I want to be part of the girls, and talk about fit blokes and the latest episode of sex and the city, but society (the school) wont let me. Laura seems to let me in a lot more, today, she told me about a letter Arron sent her, presumable a love letter, the other day, something which Lara and Charlie refused to tell me the day before, but, to be fair, I suppose it wasn’t there gossip to tell. Of couse Lloyd wanted to know in Science what Laura was talking about but I said nothing, actually I misled him, in an attempt to show the ladies I can be trusted with secret stuff. Not sure if any of them noticed. Arron, really confuses me, he’s so blatantly gay, and yet he does things like send love letters to girlfriends and saying he believes gay people shouldn’t be able to get married and adopt children and stuff. I’m sure it’s a cover. Unlike me he doesn’t want to be gay and denies it through constant gays are bad references. I managed to get out of doing my PE analysis thing today. Basically, one of the PE teachers ask a load of questions about the sport you’ve chosen and grade you for it. The end of the double period lesson came to an end and I was not next but the one after that, so I just missed it. But, of course, I still have to do it, another day, so I guess it isn’t that much of a great thing. Lloyd was sitting with us again today in youth club, which really pisses me off. Lunch time is my girly time, and having a man there doesn’t help. He sat behind me cause there was no room in the human circle, to start off with I pretended I didn’t know he was there until he spoke, then I had to acknowledge him. I did a tiny little flit with Arron in youth club (god I hate hate that name, makes us sound like yobs) as well. He was resting his legs on me seat and when I got up to throw some rubbish in the bin his legs fell down. He jokingly said oh, Jonathon, so I pushed the chair back forward so he could reach. Like I say it was a very small flirt, in fact know one could possible have know it was a flit other than me. You see, I’d only do that for someone I like, besides I enjoy having Arrons legs resting on my seat cause I get to see a little bit of leg flesh (he wares trainer socks), and Arrons got well nice legs – perfectly tanned, perfectly shaped and they have lovely little hares on them. I guess that’s all that happened today, from yourth club me, Katie, Amy and Vicky ran in the rain to our tutors and the rest I’ve already been through. Oh yeah, on the way to maths I saw Amy (not the one just mentioned, a different one, although they both have the same surnames – Smith), and told her about the kissing action, she’s one of the main people trying to get us to kiss. So, we both got all excited and high-pichy voiced, and, you know I might even done a bit of a gay limp hand movement.
