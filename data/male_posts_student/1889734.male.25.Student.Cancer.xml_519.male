I thought that after Altered Carbon, I would have to wait some time for Morgan's next book, Broken Angels.  I guess I wasn't paying attention, because Angels has been out for some time now, and I picked it up on the same day I bought the Koran and the SS book (again, I'm on someone's watch list).  Do yourself a favor and go get Altered Carbon.  Morgan is a masterful writer!  The highest quality of prose.  I'm about 90 pages into Broken Angel and it is more of the same - I'm pausing between chapters to just digest the prose, bask in it and fester in envy over what he is doing.  Go read it!
