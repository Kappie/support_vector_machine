BEST LEGAL WORD I LEARNED IN 2003: "Easement" BEST MEAL IN THE LAW SCHOOL CAFETERIA: The purple things with the brown sauce and white stuff BEST LAW SCHOOL: Florida International University, because one of the professors e-mailed me in response to a post BEST LAW SCHOOL RANKINGS: U.S. News BEST CASEBOOK: Tie -- "Property," "Bankruptcy" BEST LEGAL REGIME OF 2003: Constitutional democracy BEST LAW: The one against cars driving on the sidewalk, because otherwise walking outside would suck BEST LAWYER: The hiring partner at the firm where I accepted my summer offer BEST WAY TO JUSTIFY LAW SCHOOL TO FAMILY: Telling them what a summer associate gets paid BEST LEGAL RESOURCE: Library BEST LOCATION TO PRACTICE LAW: Courtroom BEST THING THAT IS LEGAL: Tie -- sleeping, eating BEST LAW-RELATED TV SHOW: "Judging Amy" (I'm serious -- it's really good!) BEST LAW-RELATED SONG: "The Remedy" (Jason Mraz)  Yes, I'm kind of stupid.
