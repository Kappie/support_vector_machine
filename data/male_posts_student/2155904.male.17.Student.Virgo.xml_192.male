This year is just an easy little AP test.  Yeah, AP Government test is tomorrow but that shouldn't be that bad.  It won't be fun writing the 4 essays but really they won't be all that brain-crunching (there's a weird picture).  The multiple choice part will be fine.  And the best part is that they should get out by like 11-11:30 meaning that they will get at least an hour and a half to have lunch.  They don't have to be back at school until like 1.  And Tyke still might come back late.  Cuz hey, he can.  Oh, back to the actual events of today.  Well, there weren't really many events of today so maybe that is a bad segway (hehe, that was in the Trivial Pursuit game on Saturday).  But anyway, Tyke found out his grade in AP English today. It shows that not working until the last minute doesn't necessarily mean that you will be able to pull off what you want.  He has a 67.1% in there right now.  He was hoping for at least 69.5% but he is quite a bit off from that.  How this happened, he doesn't know really know since Amed seems to have done almost the exact same amount of work in there since they both started working and they started with basically the same grade and yet he has a full 2.5% higher than Tyke.  Hmmm...odd.  So Tyke might need to try to get the aid of Big or Little Twigg to help pilfer the deficiency that will be coming in the mail when Tyke is in Ashland next week.  That could still not work though.  Hopefully all goes well.  Tyke, Amed, and Doc P got out of English about 5 minutes early again today.  So they went to JIB and Tyke got the ever-so-filling Bacon Ultimate meal.  That is a monstrously mmmmm meal.  It takes all of Tyke's 132 pound frame to handle all the meat and cheese.  What a delicacy it is though.  In Physics Tyke was a little worried about having to present a problem but he got lucky and didn't have to.  And although the quiz was hard he didn't mind taking it all that much.  But after school he didn't really have much fun for a while.  He did re-burn a few CDs that he gave out and no longer had copies of though.  So now he has 3 more to add to his great compilation.  He still needs to re-burn the 70s mix though.  That was a fun couple of CDs.  Tyke was tired as usual and managed to fall asleep a couple of times once again.  Every Monday and Tuesday he seems to fall asleep at least once.  It's a new tradition.  But he talked to his mom about England and how they have a house set up for the first week and a half they are there.  Speaking of England, at the soccer game at night Tyke and Mandy sat next to each other and they chatted briefly about Tyke going to England and about how Mandy might get to as well.  That would be really cool.  They might get to see each other there.  Odds are it won't happen but if it does it would be awesome.  But back to Tyke, haha.  He had some nice faJITAS for dinner and they were tasty.  Then after that he got some papers signed and came back online.  All of a sudden he got an urge to go to the soccer game at Sly Lion because the weather was nice and it would still be fun.  So he talked to Kinker and after a weird little debate (they weren't on opposite sides so it wasn't really a debate per se, but they were debating whether or not to go) and they decided to go.  Tyke drove after Kinker got to his house and they got there just as Kramm was scoring the one and only goal.  They didn't see it though.  Tyke and Kinker talked to a few Issy's and then talked to Mandy for most of the time.  After the game they went over to the Sly Lion side and saw the Issy traitors Purdy and Haras.  Tyke talked with C-Biscuit and BNelly for a little bit as well.  But then Tyke and Kinker left.  The funny part about leaving though is right when Tyke and Kinker got in the car and started it.  Tyke had the CD in that had Eamon's 'Fuck It' on there and it just so happened to be cued up that when Tyke started the car the speakers played "Fuck you you ho, I don't want you back."  Kinker was in the middle of saying something when they played and it was quite funny.  A real hehe chuckler.  After they got back to Tyke's they checked each other's headlights because Tyke noticed that he thought his left one was not as bright as the right one, but the thought that it might be like that on purpose.  Like, maybe it is like that so that it doesn't blind the drivers coming the opposite way.  So they checked Kinker's but his weren't like Tyke's.  So they didn't really get an answer to their question.  Then Tyke tried to figure out what he was doing when Kinker flew over his house and Tyke's car wasn't there one day but he couldn't.  So Kinker is going to go back and check the picture he took of Tyke's house to see if Tyke's car really wasn't there.  It will be interesting to find out.  And then Tyke came inside and his mom asked him about prom.  And that was it.  Just prom.
