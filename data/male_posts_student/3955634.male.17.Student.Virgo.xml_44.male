Along with  urlLink Kos , it's the place to go for general updates on the latest polls and some basic poll analysis.  I sure as hell hope  urlLink Jesse Taylor is right .  Along with  urlLink national preparedness month , it looks like BushCo and Karl Rove are rolling out a comprehensive plan to frighten parents into voting for Bush to keep their children safe. Bob Herbert has a few details at  urlLink Tom Tomorrow , too.  I can't quite express how appalling I find this new tactic. It plays on ordinary people's fears in such a cold, calculated manner. And honestly, I can't see how this will win Bush votes. Not only is it negative campaigning (which people profess to dislike), but it's negative campaigning with no target--or a target so vague that it ends up meaning little or nothing. Beyond breeding caution and fear and subtly encouraging bigotry (keep an eye out for those Syrian musicians especially! Jeepers!), what's the point?  Oh.  That  is  the point. To get the nation to come back to Daddy Bush after getting a glimpse of the wide, wide world outside. Shit man, isn't it  scary  out there?  Come back and we'll  urlLink tell you how to shut it all out .  That is, as long as you ignore the fact that Kerry is doing  urlLink quite well   urlLink for himself .  And it looks like Bush is losing a  urlLink few   urlLink important   urlLink groups , ones that he really needs to keep a handle on in order to win this thing. Young and old, it looks like the public is starting to get a handle on what's happening to them, and connecting it to the people in power.   urlLink And what  about  the children?    Beyond that fact that we're  urlLink chronically underfunding education (warning:big pdf)?  Firing young, vibrant  urlLink teachers ?   Fifty-five percent  think they're going to have to serve in the military someday.  At the University of Minnesota they've  urlLink raised tuition  by double digit percentages four years in a row--I'm paying fifty percent more for credits than a graduate of just five years ago. If I have a personal bone to pick with these guys, it's the sorry state of education funding in our country in general and Minnesota in particular. I'm all for streamlining the funding process, trying to weed out the bad apples (be it  urlLink teachers  [*wink] or  urlLink administrators ), and in finding educational approaches that work for more children.  The way to do that is not to cut funding to pre-90s levels.  More money  may not  equal better education, but less money  certainly does not  equal better education.  Curses, I've lost my focus...talking about education always gets my dander up.  Expect more on this topic sometime soon.  As for the fear in electoral politics, it's hard to miss these days.  But from now on I'll be paying a bit more intention to the target of the message.
