And it seems that things are getting worse before they're getting better.  Allow me to explain.  This whole train of thought probably started percolating sometime around Christmas - it's supposed to be a time of joy, of laughter and fun and giving, but it most certainly didn't seem like any of those things for me.  The things that I actually enjoyed doing (being with friends  family, helping at church, etc.) just didn't seem to have the meaning or essence to them that makes them so much fun for me.  And the whole season seemed dead - instead of being a celebration of Christ's birth and all it seemed like an abyss of melancholy, like everything good about it just fell off a cliff before it got to me.  Any spiritual significance seemed gone, and that really got me wondering why.  I won't go so far as to say that I got worried about it - "concerned" is probably a better word - but this whole sense of spiritual emptiness and loneliness seemed to have been dogging me for a while and I needed to confront it.  I just seem to have drifted so far away from who I want to be that it seems that I can't even remember what that was or why I wanted to be that way aside from a few superficial vestiges belying the deeper reasons.    I went to a get-together with some of the guys from Mr. Robinson's Bible study during break and Jon was asking everyone what God had been teaching them over the past semester.  I have to admit that I felt both relief and disappointment that I had to leave before my turn came up - relief that I didn't have to admit that I didn't think I had learned anything about God over the last six months and that He'd seemed pretty dead to me for a long time, but disappointment that I didn't have the opportunity to confess this to some guys who might actually be able to help me.  I thought I might bring it up later, but of course I didn't.  Heck, everyone probably thinks that I'm just peachy aside from being a little moody every once in a while.  Oh, what people don't know and don't want to find out.  Truth is, I've been alienated from myself and my beliefs for a long time now.  Marxian scholars speak of a "false consciousness" impressed upon oppressed classes which cause them to accept their oppression because they do not see it as that - they are blinded to the reality around them, divorced from the knowledge and wisdom which would open their eyes to the situation they are in.  I feel the same way - I feel like I've been so divorced from my beliefs that I have forgotten they are my beliefs, so estranged from my God that I forget He exists and what His presence is like.  Life goes on, day by day, not moments to be lived in but moments to be gotten by.  Life is not a mission but an endless stream of faceless things, faceless events, faceless people, occassionally punctuated by something reminding me that life can be more.  But life can only be something more with a purpose, a reason for making the extra effort to come out of the cave and see the sun.  But I don't know what that purpose is.  Every time that I try to rediscover it it just seems like I run into the same roadblocks - my damned questions about everything which never seem to get adequate answers, my lack of faith, my twisted logic, my laziness.    They gave out calendars at church with a schedule for reading through the Bible in a year and I made up my mind I was going to try it - of course, I haven't broken the cover of my Bible in about two months or so (including when I go to church), so trying to do so now hasn't exactly been easy.  Actually, it's the 6th of January and I still haven't started - I just feel so intimidated by actually reading the Bible.  I just think up questions and can't answer them and I'm too lazy to actually research things and I don't feel right just outright asking people because I don't want to put them on the spot...  And then there was what happened today.  Just a routine doctors checkup before I go to D.C. and all (the preparations for which are a whole story on their own), but I got the aforementioned wake-up call.  I probably should have seen it coming, but maybe it was just having a doctor tell me about it that brought it into focus.  Basically, I'm getting too unhealthy.  I used to always rely on sports and all to keep me in shape (and even when I was playing sports I never worked out on the side), so when I stopped playing three years ago I didn't really have a plan for staying in shape or anything aside from trying to work out when I can, secretly hoping that I would find someone else who I could work out with and who would push me to do so.  I believe that I can now say that this lack of planning and support is an unqualified disaster - during the checkup the doctor was telling me how I was adding to my risks for this and that because of the way I was living and all (and he was right).  So now I need to start doing something about this - and I feel just as helpless about this as I do about the whole relationship-with-God thing.  The funamental problem is that I don't know where to start on either of them.  I've become so accustomed to a certain way of life, a certain way of doing things, a certain mindset, that I don't have the first idea about where to start changing, but I know that if I stay the way I am now I'm only going to be miserable (both now and later).  But I think the operative word here is helpless - Lord knows this isn't the first time I've tried to turn things around, and after a certain number of attempts one starts to become defeatist.  I know I'm a high-maintenance person sometimes, but it seems like I'm always getting the low-maintenance treatment.  Sometimes I wish I had joined the Army or something, not because I especially want to go into combat, but because I need someone to be pushing me, telling me I can do better.  It seems like right now everyone is saying I'm doing well enough and leaving it at that, either not taking the time to really find out how things are going or not caring one way or the other.  And I hate the way that I keep waiting for someone to come along and actually have faith in me, someone who will push me to be better because they know I can be.  But it doesn't seem like anyone has that kind of faith in me, and I certainly don't have it in myself...  Anyway, maybe this is just a depressive tirade, but I don't think so - I feel fine right now, and I've become very aware of when I'm getting depressed.  I think it's more desperation - if this sounds like a cry for help, well, that's exactly what it is.  I'm at my wits end about what to do here, and maybe getting it all down will help me come to some conclusions (aside from the thereaputic affects of directing my comments at a fictionalized audience and imaging someone gives a damn)...
