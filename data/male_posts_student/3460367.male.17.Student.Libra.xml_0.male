So I talked to Kevin and Jill for a bit.  Then I went to bed after staying up as late as possible.  I really hate how I acted.  It was deliberate and I was such a jerk.  Anyways Sunday morning was the usual deal at church.  I had to do children's church that day too.  Alissa LaCourse was baptized.  All through church Kevin and Kyle were trying to get me to come to the movies.  I didn't really know what I wanted to do.  I went home and I had lunch.  I sent Lisa an email telling her I was sorry for how I acted.  Then I told her I wanted to talk to her later and explain myself.  So I decided to go to the movie.  Better than wasting my time sitting around at home.  The movie was okay.  Afterwards we hung out at the mall for a bit.  Then we ate.  I got Jay fries and a drink since he didn't have any money.  Then Kyle and I took Kevin and went to my house so I could get my shoes and tell my parents we were playing basketball at Kyle's house.  We played for awhile then I had to take Kevin home and get milk.  When I got home I saw that Lisa had sent me an email and had been on a lot that day.  I talked for a bit then asked if I could call and explain myself.  She said yes and so we talked for awhile.  I think she understands how I feel and what I see etc but IDK.  So now I've told her mostly what is on my mind.  I don't know what to do now.  I just wish I could forget about everything.  I've decided that I am going to minimize my online time as much as possible now.  I don't think it helps me and I can be more productive this way.  I just want to be so busy that I don't have to worry about thinking.  I'll be busy enough this week, and hopefully I can stay that busy.  I'd go running a whole lot more except for my knee and my ankle.  I probably should just rest for a week but I don't want to do that.  I am kinda afraid that my knees are going to turn out like my dad's.  I really don't want that to happen.  But lately they have been feeling worse and worse.  I'm hoping it is just growing pains... wouldn't that be nice.  But yeah I am pretty afraid.  I can't wait to be done with living.  Why do we have to have such a long lifespan?  (Incase anyone is reading this I'm not suicidal, I just don't want to have to deal with everything.)  I'm so sick of feeling like this.  I just want to be happy, not being dragged around emotionally.  Oh well... off to work/chores/family gatherings... woohoo.
