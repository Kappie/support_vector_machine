I'll prolly do it again.  Def ended up driving to Wegman's afterwards and had to fucking eat Terimasu with a single chopstick. And now I'm home and  extremely tired. So I'm cutting this short cuz I'm in the middle of conversations with certain special someones. I'll ttyl.   Cold, cold water surrounds me now     And all I've got is your hand    Lord, can you hear me now?
