It's piss but me dad's got his shitty music on nd I can't concentrate. I'm never in the mood to revise anyway and I just can't be arsed. It's like everyones been revising for yonks, and I'm just- the exception. I havn't even started revising for Maths- the exams on Tuesday! Oh well- in 19 days I won't have ANY EXAMS LEFT!  Rite f**k this I'm goin for a ride round castle eden...
