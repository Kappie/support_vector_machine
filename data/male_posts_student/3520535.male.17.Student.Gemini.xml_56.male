All I can hope for is that what I am becoming is better than that which I have been. I'm optimistic in that regard. There remains one month this summer for me to get my life together. I still have work to deal with, but I still have plenty of time to do what I need to accomplish. I am readying myself to prepare for the future. There are colleges to look at, scholarships to consider, SAT scores to improve, summer reading for AP next year to do, and general studying in the realms of Spanish and French languages, and Basque culture, food, and history. Yes, that's a lot, but my girlfriend has moved across the country and I don't have much occupying my time. So, single and spotting failure looming ahead in the horizon I have decided that I must scurry to assure my place in the moonlight. I'm thinking a lot about school next year - you know this is the part of summer I hate the most, when I begin to miss school. I have a plan for how the year will go. I hope that things go over well with my license and that frivolous reckless driving charge so that I don't have to pay outrageous insurance for my car. Assuming so, and assuming that my car stays in decent shape, I don't want to keep a job. I won't be able to with school hours and the pile of homework I'm sure I'll have. So, I will focus on my school work, strive for the best possible grades, and put that before all other things. I also plan on spending the month of November writing a novel for NaNoWriMo and then the rest of the year editing and adding to it. There will be much writing my senior year, particularly since I have AP English and a creative writing course. I plan on spending much time in bookstores, libraries, and coffee shops. I'll probably do most homework in jitters. Well, I have the best times ahead of me, and confidence inbues my soul with hope that I can in fact accomplish all that I have put off these last three tortuous years. Farewell, lethargy.
