That's kinda how I feel about the Austin Powers movies. Back to 50 First Dates. Adam Sandler was funny. Drew Barrymore was, uh, Drew Barrymore. And of course, Adam Sandler brought in a couple of actors that have been in ALL of his movies.   Okay, something I noticed about this movie was, it was a bit too long. I mean, it is kinda one of those movies, that is good, but runs a little too long. Still, I liked it. Adam Sandler did a good job. I was ready to have a good laugh when they got to the scene when he gets out his acoustic guitar to sing to Lucy (Drew Barrymore). Like all of his guitar songs, it was funny. He got to one riff that goes like, "Lucy broke her head, just like Gary Busey did." I thought that was harsh, but funny.  WOW! I was surprised with the music. They had some damn-good stuff! They had some Bob Marley and stuff like that. In fact, this morning the only thing on TV was TRL, which I friggin' hate! Adam Sandler was there and he talked about how for the soundtrack there's some newer bands doing old/80s songs. I thought that was cool. Hell, I might go and buy the soundtrack to this movie.  I noticed that Adam Sandler uses stuff from his older movies in this one. Like there's a golf scene when they're golfing and they get a running start, just like in Happy Gilmore. And when he's pissed-off he screamed, "You sick! You sick son-of-a-bitch! How could you do that to me?! Like in Mr. Deeds. Pretty cool, eh?  Grade - Well, I gotta do it. The movie was good. I'm gonna give it a ***1/2. It was good, but not great. It wasn't Adam Sandler's BEST film. But still, if your desperate for a good laugh on Valentines Day, see 50 First Dates. You'll like it, I know I did.  By the way, HAPPY VALENTINES DAY to all Suburban Myths fans!!!
