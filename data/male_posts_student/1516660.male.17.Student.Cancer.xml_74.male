It means that you don't expect love back when you give love to the other party. You love the other party because you do, not because you want him to love you back.  More often than not, only few romances/friendships are 'uncondtional relationship'. Everybody wants something out of the other party. Seriously. I observed. A lot lor. They say, mother's love is unconditional. I agree. This is the most purest form of love. Great mother's love.  Me? I give both. I am guilty of committing 'conditional love' on some of my friends. I realised that now. If they don't love me, fine. As long as I do. Unconditional love, yeah, I do that. Only those those I trust perfectly. People like my  VERY EXTREMELY CLOSE  friends. But now, I am trying my best to change all my 'conditional love' to 'unconditional love'.  Hmm..yeah. That's about all. Quite chim right? Actually, this two day's thoughts are the weakest....I still think the one about LOVE is my best written work in this blog (I treat this blog as one of my writing exercises....and mind-clearing....HaHa!).  See ya tomorrow, blog old friend.
