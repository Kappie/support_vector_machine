I am 15/m/ireland as of august 2004.  I am currently trying to: 1.Not kill my brother 2.Find a house 3.Find a school 4. Entertain myself  all in the next 4 weeks....damn...thats hard....  I traveled here form Seattle Washington on my own so that was cool at least. I felt slightly independant. The only bad parts were in Heathrow airport when I was:  1.Stuck behind an old woman in line for half an hour 2.Running through the airport with ALL my stuff trying not to miss my flight. 3.Sitting on an airplane for 3 hrs without taking off due to thrunder storms 4.Having no food....  It was hell.....  But I finally got here and now I am living in a hotel trying to do everything I listed above. I am looking @ houses, schools, cell phones, misc electronic adapters...meh!  I was so sad to leave but in many ways I was glad to leave.   I was sad to leave because I had a job which was my social life. I worked at the Pro sports club in the day care center. Which I was going to switch out of anyway to a Computer Job since that is what I am most proficent in.  But I was happy to leave since I want my old school to blow up and burn to the ground. My old school is nothing but preppy spoiled brats. They all think they are black, when they are acutally White Upper Class acting, "Gangsta" pisses me off. Whenever they said G,g,g,g,gG UNIT! I wanted to just yell G,G,G,G,g,g,g GET OUT!  Damn...glad I am gone!  Any who...my friendship is up for anyone willing to accept it....if anyone wants to AIM or Email me look in my prof.....  Peace  -Prometheus
