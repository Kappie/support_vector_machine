After breakfast, we spent most of the day lounging around, watching tv and chatting. We've just about sorted out our trip to shanghai next week, it all sounds very promising.  For dinner, yuqi's father made some excellent filled dumplings. I have to say, i liked them so much, yuqi remarked i ate more of those than any other food so far here.  As i write this now, it's very cool outside. Although quite a hot day, when we went out for a walk after dinner, it started to rain (up to my old tricks again!) after a while it turned into an impressive storm with thunder and lightning. Now, it's all calmed down, and i'm enjoying the cool air coming through the window.  Gonna have more to report tomorrow :)  interesting china fact #1 - in the cities, a lot of the traffic lights have counters showing the amount of time before the lights change. Should be quite handy for boy racers!
