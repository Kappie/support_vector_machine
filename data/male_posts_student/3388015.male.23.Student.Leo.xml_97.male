It was one of the best days I've had in a long time.  It was nice to relax.  Monday was almost a repeat of Sunday!  Amazing.  Laura came over in the evening to visit Cindy and I, watch TV and whatnot and I planned for my trip.  Cindy did some dishes, I cleaned up a little.  Tuesday was a good day.  I had a blowout meeting in the morning (they canceled without telling me) and I felt rushed in the afternoon.  Prolly because I took a 75 minute lunch.  Those extra 15 minutes are important.  I demonstrated the website to Nancy at 3:30 and by 4 I was cleaning my office.  I left at 4:30, rushed home, changed and took Ashley to the vet for her rabbies shot.  We got there 15 minutes late, but they took her anyway.  We came back and I left to get Laura for our shopping spree.  We went to Old Navy, I tried on some board shorts and some swim trunks.  I ended up buying a red and black pair of board shorts.  We went to the mall and checked out Express for men, I bought a couple pairs of summer shorts, then we went to Walmart and got supplies (and a couple shirts).  We stopped by McDonalds, picked up some food for Cindy and then went to pick her up.  We came back, Laura did a fashion show with the old clothes Cindy does not wear anymore.  I cleaned, packed, did laundry and relaxed for the evening.  My mother and sister get here at 4:30am, so I need to get to bed.  Wish me luck, we fly out in a couple hours.
