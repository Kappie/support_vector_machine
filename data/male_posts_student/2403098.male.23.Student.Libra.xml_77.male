This show, coupled with "I Love the 70's/80's," is the reason I love VH1.  They went from playing Phil Collins a lot, to actually having quite the sense of humor.  These fun shows mixed with the fact that they run lots of advertisements for condoms and STD awareness makes me think that "Video Hits 1" (a name that makes no sense) is appealing to a younger demographic now.  Either that or they're appealing to a humor-friendly Zimbabwean population (STD reference.. apparently there's lots there)  I knew today was going to be a better day than the last few days when my professor made the following comment in my 2-week-summer-class:  "Is it hot in here?" the class responded "yes" and he continued "Good, I sometimes don't know if it's hot or if I'm just fat."  pissing yourself in class is embarrassing, so I tried really hard to hold the urine in after that statement.    Hey HEY, I just was instant messaging with a friend and wanted to describe how I was in a difficult position, and accidentally came up with a new way of typing it.  Wanna see?  I thought so.. okay here goes:  "Rock-Mason-Hardplace"  Do you like it?  I did.  I was like "hey!! Look, Mason between a rock and a hard place."  Okay, lauren was right when she said the other day that I have the attention span of MAYBE a hamster (if even) or something, but I somehow come full circle when I write.  I would agree.  I go all over the place when I write.  She was referring to various letters/cards I have written her over the course of our friendship.  I would have to say it's true with my blog, with my thought process, and with my life in general.  I get distracted, go off on some tangent, but it all seems to come back and make sense.  At least that's what I'd like to believe.  So I was in line at McDonalds today, to get a salad, and I ended up with a quarter pounder with cheese somehow.  Oh well, whatever.  I swear my intentions were good going in.  Anyway, while in line I was laughing on the phone with lauren (I should title my blog "stuff about lauren and I it seems.  I should also stop using parenthetical references mid-sentence) and the lady behind the counter goes "you have SUCH a nice smile."  I thought that was pretty nice, but then it turned into a conversation between the employees behind the counter.  "DOESN'T he have a NICE smile?"  I promptly checked the mirror in the car when I got back out to the parking lot.  Yeah, coke-stained teeth dude, real nice.  In some worlds, I'm a fuckin' male super model!  That world.. is McDonalds at the lunch-time rush.  I'll take it anyway.  Which way to wardrobe?  Just past the indoor playground?  cool.  "Dancing on the Ceiling" just made number 22 on the list of worst songs, by the way.  A panelist on the show just made a wonderful comment about the Lionell Richie song "Dancing on the Ceiling."  "Sadly" he said "the money that Lionell Richie made on this horrible song, has twenty-years later allowed Nicole Richie to go on TV and annoy an entire new generation of people."  Rock on.  I'm seriously laughing so much at the cynasism of this show.  I think I want it on DVD or something.  Well, I guess I better go now.  I have several phone calls to return, loose ends to tie up, and at least 45 minutes of cardiovascular excercise to accomplish at the gym.  I was so frustrated with my past few days that I "accidentally" did an entire hour on the elliptical machine Monday night.  Anyone who knows me well, knows that cardio is my least favorite part of my workout regime.  Therefore, the idea of an hour of non-stop cardio was strange.  I guess I had lots of energy to release.  The machine told me I also released 750 calories, so that works for me.  RRAAAWWWWWRRRR!!   CAPTAIN CARDIO!
