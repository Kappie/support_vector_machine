However, I did recently go to the carwash. As you may have already guessed...I washed my car. For the first time in eleven and a half months, and only the second time during its life with me, my car got a thorough cleaning. It was interesting, a good experience if nothing else. The rainbow shine smells of sweet bubble gum!  I went to Wal-mart yesterday to buy a radio. I needed one, seeing as how I have been incredibly bored at work recently. It isn't that I have nothing to do. The work is simply mindless but I can't complain, full-time at seven bucks an hour brings in some serious cash. Anyway, I was really bored yesterday so I started plotting to kill my co-workers. One-by-one I thought about how I could lure them into a secluded area and what the best way to kill them would be. Suffocation, stabbing with the scissors, stabbing with the letter opener, stabbing with the pen, shooting the electric stapler at them, binding them with calculator tape, throwing them down an elevator shaft, poisoning the food in the cafeteria, pushing them down the stairs, running them over as they crossed the street, throwing them out a window, but then I realized that I don't have to kill them because they will probably die from boredom within the next few weeks anyway. Besides my co-workers are nice people whom I wouldn't want to kill unless they managed to really piss me off, which doesn't happen very often. I can't believe that I am actually plotting their deaths, I suspect I could never kill a person even if I wanted to-I have too much respect for life in general. So that is why I bought a radio. And then Spencer and I were arguing about whether or not pifle is a word. He kept saying "pifle this and pifle that", it was pissing me off because I was sure that pifle wasn't a word. I was wrong, pifle is a synonym for rubbish or tom-foolery. That is absolute pifle.   "This whole blog is nothing but bloody pifle" --Andy Mitchelson
