I have lived in Various Cities throughout India  also spent a few years in the US . I now watch more Hindi / English Movies than Tamil , Follow the National/International Politics much more than the state politics but if there is one thing that hasn't changed is my craving for Madrasi Food.                                   I have never been  never will be a big fan of Chappathi/Roti cuisine and my countless trips in the NCR Region in search of good south Indian food would be testimony to that fact. Idli still remains my favourite breakfast !!. This weekend had some Great food at a friend's place  also had a wonderful dinner in Delhi. All these culinary musings are perhaps an afterthought of such good food :-)
