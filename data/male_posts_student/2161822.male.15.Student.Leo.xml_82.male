Not that I talk to alot of people though. Actually only a few. But today was still boring as hell. Tomorrow I have gym again so let's hope I don't get injured. Maybe we'll play Cageball. That is one of the most pointless games I've ever participated in, yet it's still some fun. It's basically two teams trying to push an enormous ball to the opposite side of the gym. Fun part is, there really isn't any rules on what you're allowed to do. So last time we played, we had two of the larger kids pushing it, other kids hitting it, and people jumping at it. Then you had Wilson pulling kids off of the ball and tackling them. So you never know what you'll get playing Cageball. Funny I get hurt playing basketball and not Cageball.   Listen to H.I.M.
