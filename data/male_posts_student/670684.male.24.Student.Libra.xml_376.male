But here I am, a golf match scheduled tomorrow morning, that I should be sleeping for.  I should have worked on DAWSON IN 96! (working title) a lot earlier today.  Office hours end, and I transition to Dawson.  Easy enough.  Except I ran into Javier today, good old Javier from the MFA program.  I will say nothing bad about Javier's work, of which I am only briefly acquainted, because I don't feel like getting into a pissing contest.    Javier wanted scripts.  I sent him a couple.  Two months ago.  No word back from him on it...not a problem, this is how the business works.  I had pretty much forgotten about them, though I will say that I was excited that someone was reading my work.  Excited that someone who made films was reading my work.    When sexy neighbor lady doesn't leave a note on my windshield, I understand that she wasn't interested.  No matter how much I do not want to accept it, it's the name of the game.  She didn't have it for me.  And it sucked for a bit.  And every once in a while, I'll walk out to my car, and be mistaken that there is something on my car, and hope for just a second that this was all a game of possum.  Until I see it is nothing more than reflection, and I do suck for leaving her several notes.    When Javier doesn't email me back about my scripts, I don't think there is something wrong.  He mentioned he'd get to them in 10 days.  Then he said a month.  Then he said when he had time.  And that was fair.  It's a busy time for everyone.    So I see J-daddy today at Little City during a bevy of student work.  He's there with Richard Lewis, and some other film folks, none of whom throw a wave my way, but that's okay, because I'm with students and we're talking script and film and stuff...it's my office hours.  Anyway, Javy starts to leave as I'm still there, so I decide to stop by and let him know that I've got another short film in the works, and it's something more palatable for production, as it's got more traditional avenues of drama (no armpit farts, no threesomes with dead people in a french new wave style).    As I tell Javier I've got something else, he does nothing but look at me impatiently.  "Oh," he says to my news.  "Well, I'm always interested in reading work, I guess," he says, in words that rang hollow to me at first, but as I look back, smell of bellicose pretentiousness.  And while I didn't see that at first, it was obvious his excitement towards my work was waning.  I asked if he had read my work, and he forced a meager smile, a kid with his hand caught in the cookie jar.  He had read it.  And he hadn't enjoyed it.  He wouldn't tell me why.  Actually, he left right then...he was too happy to get out of the situation.  It left me with saying, "I wear big boy pants.  I can handle criticism."    I do wear big boy pants.  And I can handle criticism.  I see my weaknesses as a writer pretty vividly.  But this one stings more than most.  Maybe it's because I looked at Javier as my only UT option to get work produced...and production here was one of the selling points of the program.  Maybe I'm stressed over thesis and shit.  Maybe I have a soft skin on this stuff, and can't handle criticism.  Maybe I'm scared that I can't do this as a career.  That I lack the talent to play at the next level.  That I lack the it.    The weed-out process of life is interesting, no doubt.  Rogers High School, I was the creative writer.  I was the guy folks went to when they wanted something written.  Centenary, there was a little more competition, but I still ended up on top of the mountain.  UT is different, though I'm in the top tier of writers in the MA program.    But, as I often say to family who coo my accomplishments, what good is being good in Austin if I'm not good enough for the big screen?  This isn't a fishing contest for "you're a good writer" comments.  I don't care.  I wouldn't be here if I didn't think I was good.  I'm just curious...
