But yeah I'm awaiting my classes that I will be in in high school to arrive in the mail. For some odd and extraordinary reason I'm always excited to start a new school year and go back to school,I don't know if it's the fact that i like to learn new things or what but I'm going to high school this fall. I just want to do good in school, be proud of myself, keep my friends, and go to college. For some reason my feelings have changed about high school but I still think it will just be another year of school but I'm rally excited about going to a new school and learning new things at that school. So this is Alonzo signing off.  p.s.  chichi if u got your classes for high school like ian did pleaz tell send mean e-mail and say for u erich if u are reading this, my e-mail is darckloud_skye29@hotmail.com
