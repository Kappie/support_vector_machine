Pistons just beat the shit out of the Lakers! I mean, the Lakers made SO many mistakes I don't even know where to start! They did so shitty with their shooting, defense, free-throw shots, and everything! They didn’t know what the fuck they were doing! I mean, no one, and I mean NO ONE, was sinking their FT’s and the Lakers NEEDED those 3-pointers, but they weren’t shooting them!!! I mean, c’mon, a bunch of retards on acid with their eyes shut could have beat the Lakers! Yes, it was THAT bad!   Well, hope you enjoyed watching the Lakers go through a good whoopin’! I know I did!   And wouldn’t it be cool if the White Stripes performed?!
