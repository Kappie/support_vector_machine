I believe the 9th Circuit's decision is not about purging the nation of religious expression, nor anti-patriotism. To me the issue is making the Pledge of the Allegiance inclusive of believers and non-believers. My reaction to the public outcry was similar to that of my impressions of the outcry after 9/11... either the media only lets ignorant people voice their opinions, or the public in general is ignorant. The things people say! I swear! Some people are so caught up in their religious or political beliefs that they ignore that there are other opinions and beliefs out there. Don't get me started on all the people that say that this nation was founded and is successful because of God. We live in a multicultural nation and world that encompasses different religions, political ideals, and cultures. If the United States is supposed to be the pinnacle of multiculturalism, then our government and unfortunately many of our citizens' attitudes don't mirror that image.  *
