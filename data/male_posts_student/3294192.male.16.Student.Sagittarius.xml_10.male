I remember when I was little that 9 was bedtime, and me and my brother would push it to 10, and eventually 11, and now I normally don't get to sleep until about 2. That's why I'm sleepy I guess. Part of the reason I want to get a little more sleep than normal tonight is tomorrow's agenda. I'm going to Six Flags with most of my physics class. To sign up, I had to deal with a couple of forms that were quite a hassle to get properly signed and returned on time. A lot of people I know aren't going tomorrow because they weren't able to do this. It's funny, because when you ask them about it, they say it doesn't matter, because they hate Six Flags anyway. Or maybe  urlLink Guy  is the only person who says that, oh well. But c'mon, how can you hate Six Flags? I can understand not enjoying roller-coasters, but less than you want to sit in a school on a beautiful spring day? Incredible. I plan to spend the day with my buddy  urlLink Kate , who was also able to return her permission slips on time. It'll be good fun.   In my quest for more and comics, I took another one out of the school library. It's called "Berlin: City of Stone" and is a historical fiction about the life of an artist in Berlin, Germany, right before the rise of the Nazis. So far, it's really good, but it's a whopping 250 or so pages long, so I'm not done yet. It's also only number 1 in a set of 3. Oh and you will not believe what I discovered inside it! Breasts and penises and fucks, oh my. I guess it's a them I can learn to deal with, and maybe even love. One comic I really like that has yet to show me the standard B is " urlLink Scary Go Round " by John Allsion. It's what I playfully call a "web comic". The archives go back for what seems like years, and he even links to his previous comic which has even MORE entries. I believe that the characters in the comic are based on his real-life friends, and this inspires me. Because I've got friends, and I like comics, so why the hell shouldn't I draw my own damn comic? Because I know it'd be about me, and I can't draw my new haircut. Fucking buzzcut. A journal comic of my own life might be nice though, however, it would replace these text posts in an instant. I really like the works of  urlLink Drew Weing  and his journal comic, " urlLink The Journal Comic ". His new project called "Little Trees" looks really good, but there are only about 3 pages so far. Correction, exactly 3 pages. He also has a comic called " urlLink Pup " on  urlLink Serializer , which I've only been able to get a glimpse of due to the nature of Serializer requiring a subscription. It does give you a lot of content though, so maybe I'll consider it. Hell, I could be their freaking spokesman the way I get infatuated with comics. So let's move on.  I'm listening to "In These Woods" by Les Savy Fav. I think it would be really cool if  urlLink we  did a cover of this song at our summer show. It has a bunch of interesting yet simple keyboard parts that me and Jon could play with. It also rocks like a trailer in Vegas.  zing . Another song of theirs I like is "Hide Me From Next February". It gets a bit repetitive at the end, but the introductory vocals kick my ass like an ass-kicking machine.  zing ? No? Okay. In other KP news, me and Jon recorded some more guitar-tracks today in his basement. They sounded hot, and I was able to put out the really nice strumming for 'Rome'. I sure hope these songs get mixed down nicely, this new album could be our best. Jon came up with the title "Volume? Clarity? Bass?", which is from "Fear And Loathing in Las Vegas". At first I thought it was bad, and assumed it was just Jon being romanticized by the book, but the context it is in in the story actually makes it really nice, and I wouldn't mind using it all now that I know what the context is.  Denial is the root of forgetfulness. And forgetting is the root of upsetting. I need to make more  urlLink heartsmackingz .  Off I go to -----> The University of You Suck.              (Care of  urlLink Cat  and  urlLink Scary Go Round )
