He came so close to doing the deed that he had all the safeties and locks removed from his weapons (scope powered rifles, magnums), but he stopped because a dog in the park wouldn't leave him alone. He was a dog lover and had a change of heart.  After the police arrested him, they searched his car and found the weapons cache, medication wrappers, and Mariah Carey, the Doors, Abba and Judas Priest CDs.  Moral of the story... never mix Mariah Carey with Judas Priest. I hate to think what would have happened if it was Celine Dion and Marilyn Manson.   urlLink Site
