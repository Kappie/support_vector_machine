That sucks, but you have to deal.  On the other hand, some things do. I picked up a 5mb/s Rogers EXTREME modem today. The girl at the desk kept saying EXTREME like the word itself were all capitals and it held the utmost of urgency.  My internet is faster. One might say, were one inclined, that it is faster... to the EXTREME.  I'm going to bed; I'm tired of today.
