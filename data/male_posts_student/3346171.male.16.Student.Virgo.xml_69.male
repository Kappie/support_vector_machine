My sister desided that she's gonna work out too at the same gym i do,  but  she said that she needs gym clothes  and  a new tennis shoes  and  all that female's crap. And we are going to go to the korean store, they sell fake things for a  cheap price  and the things they sell there look real. Maybe I'll buy a tennis too.   I created another fotolog. The other one was so bad, it couldn't have more than 200 people loged , or it would not work. Well, the one i have now, i had to wait a looooooong time , because they forbited brazilian to do it more than 800 accounts a day, and i had to wait the right time to do it,check it out please and post, just a "hi" or a "hi, nice pic", or a "hi, nice pic you got ", whatever but i posted in portuguese. NO PROBLEM ,  i just said that many friends had asked me to do another fotolog and that pic was taken in RJ.   Here is the adress:   urlLink  www.fotolog.net/a_luiz
