World government is the absolute of my hatred and fear in terms of authorities. A grand, overarching creature, and almost certainly based on communist values...I shudder at the thought. I love freedom, even if some choose to use this freedom for evil, so be it. John Calvin frightens me with his views of God's truly omnipotent control over the world, even to the extent of controlling the actions of men and perhaps even the thoughts of men. I wish he would leave some small modicrom of freedom for our pleasure. The slightest bit of free will would be like the fingertip of water on the rich man's tongue (Bible referance. Look it up if you want). But like that rich man, no water seems to be coming. I will read on and hope for some sign of empowerment. That was what pleased me about C.S. Lewis' theology: it gave us freedom, if thoroughly without Biblical backing.  I searched for Name Generators on Google with Emily today. I was looking for the perfect to use as an instant messaging alias. I searched elf names, gangster names, hobbit names, cyborg names...and finally used a name generator called weird name. How appropriate. I shall use a mixture, a cut-and-paste of two names found in this generator. I shall be called: "Drunken Philosopher." And it will be pleasant.  A great shattering of my ways has occurred. Emily and I discussed the friends and relationships we have with people. Admittedly, Emily has the quickness to strike down fiery curses (such as "I don't really like him") on those she knows. I am slow to judge in most cases. People do not anger me easily, probably because I expcect them to be losers and annoyances. Though I am commonly an optimist, with human nature I am pessimistic and "An optimist is often dissappointed, while a pessimist is often pleasantly surprised." The conversation turned to the amount of time one must spend with someone to be considered a friend. I originally thought that I spend no great amount of time with anyone, and thus am no one's friend (many allies, many aquaintances, maybe even distant friends, but no close friends). Emily quickly pointed out that I spend plenty of time with her. I must ponder this. My previous societal engagements have been hit-and-run, "slam,bam, thank you ma'am" in nature. But she is right, I spend an undeniably large amount of time in her presence. And even talk with her there. It is strange to realize I am not the great lone wolf I always considered myself. Hmmm....
