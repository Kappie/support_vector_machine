It is labelled so, as it was originated from the jellyfish species.It is called pussyfish, as it wobbles, it is spineless, and it is one big fat hell of a pussy... A pussy is a term to describe a guy that has no balls... Pussyfishes can be found sucking up to people, they have long heads, and they claim themselves to be 'very handsome and socialble'. Pussyfishes also have very very white skin. It turns red when exposed to the sun. Pussyfishes are made up of 90% water, 10% shit, that is why they are irritating. When pussyfishes are in trouble, they run home to their mothers and complain to their mothers, that's one of the reasons why they are spineless. Another reason why they are spineless, is because they tend to depend on people for EVERYTHING, including games, homework, etc. Pussyfishes are easily agitated, you can agitate them by saying to it 'wobble' or 'pussyfish'. They are currently a closely monitored species, as they may pose a threat to the whole of humanity by disgracing it. Pussyfishes like to make empty threats. So, do not be afraid when a pussyfish says 'I'm gonna whack you!', because, it will never whack you. It 'fights' by only pushing you, thinking that by pushing you, you will get hurt greatly. But, do not fight back with a pussyfish, as it will run home to his mother and complain. To defend yourself against pussyfishes, you must need a pussyfish repellent. You can get one by telling an adult that you are being physically/mentally/sexually harrassed by a pussyfish. When you encounter with a live pussyfish, all you have to do is to tell it to fuck off. Then, ask it to wobble away. Pussyfishes have a strange desire to do the 'pussyfish/jellyfish dance'. They do so by standing up and wobbling. To see a live video of the pussyfish dance, you can order it from Dominic Ho.    Lastly, BEWARE OF PUSSYFISHES, as they are bigtime pussies  Current pussyfishes: EUGENE TAY XUE WEI
