I believe 6th grade and Erica and I went out in the rain gather up all sorts of slugs, snails, and worms. That was really fun, especially melting them all with salt and making a big mess where other kids keep their backpacks. Then I remember Siobhan hearing about the whole thing and being totally grossed out.   Yes I was an interesting kid growing up.   Class starts... today! in 13 hrs! Woohoo!  Other notes: Lemon pepper chicken on pizza with green bell peppers rock!  ***
