We talked for quite a while yesterday and the subject of love never came up. God, I miss him so much. For todays agenda I'm gonna try to play B-ball with my friends. Hopefully they will be home today, cause they weren't yesturday. I might invite Benny over ot my house, but I'm not going to come right out with anything like I was planning on before. Now that I know Ryan doesn't know I'm not that desperate anymore.   I hate NC, its to f*cking hot. Its 90 already and its almost 1:00pm!! Well there's not much other news going on so I'm going to write on my Saiyuki fanic. Enjoy!   Saiyuki: Goku and Hakkai's Confrontation - Part 2  Hakkai and Goku wake up the next morning in eachothers arms. Goku feels a little uncomfortable and turns around, his back to Hakkai. He wonders if Hakkai really likes him, or was only horny. He thinks about the night before, and gets hard once again. But this time he gets out of bed and gets dressed. Hakkai is still asleep and Goku leans over him and kisses him gently on the lips. Hakkai's eyes open and with rage he pushes Goku away. Goku with tears in his eyes says "I knew it, you don't love me....you bastard". He then runs out of the room. Hakkai sitting up in bed tries to think what is going on, but he can't remember a thing from the night before. Hakkai says outloud "Oh F*ck, it must have happened again, it was a full moon and I didn't notice it." You see, Hakkai has this condition that on every full moon his personality changes completely and the next morning he can never remember a thing. This same think happened to him with Sanzo. Hakkai now knows what he must do, he has to fall in love with Goku or they will never be friends again. Hakkai walkes downstairs to find Goku sitting on a stool at the bar with his head burried in his hands. Hakkai puts his arm around Goku and says " I'm sorry Goku, you just frightened me. I do love you and nothing will ever change that." Goku looks at Hakkai with amazment, then he smiles and hugs Hakkai. "I love you too".   Thats the end, yeah, I know its a crappy ending. But it's my fic so deal with it. So only one person reads my blog, thats OK because thats more than 0. Thanks for making everything clear to me Ryo. Hey, it sure is hard trying to talk to you. I guess its because you have school. How about you give me your email and we can talk that way. Thats all I have to say for today. TTYL
