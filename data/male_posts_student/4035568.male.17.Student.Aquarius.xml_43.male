I am so mad at myself for not meeting the qualifications for English 12 Honors. I was in English 11 Honors, and I passed, with descent grades to say the least. If you know Ms. Heiskell, an 83 is an excellent grade in her English class...she is soo hard!!But, alas, I'm not reading and stressing and using my handy dandy web site that I used all last year in English instead of actually opening whatever book was given to me to read for a grade! Hey, I still passed the tests..so HA! As of right now, I'm redoing my room. I'm getting a new bed, and new carpet, and new dresser, and a new computer desk. Maybe there will be a computer with it....hmmm...Anyways, I have also done alot of school shopping, and I am anticipating the night before school..Big party, and a great next day! It'll be memorable! NO that doesn't mean I'll be showing up at school with a hangover..losers.... :) Anywho, I'm bored...I wish I was stressing...I have to baysit all this week from 7am- 3pm, then on Thursday, we have band from 5-8pm...yeah... bored to death... and actually anticipating the first day of school...      ~Laterz~
