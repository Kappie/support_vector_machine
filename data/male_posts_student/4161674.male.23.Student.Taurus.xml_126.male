We passed on our usual choice of  urlLink Mystery Science Theater 3000  and went with the double feature of  urlLink Things To Come  and  urlLink The House That Dripped Blood .  I only knew of  urlLink Things To Come  by its reputation, and have to confess that I really wasn't all that eager to watch a slow paced film from 1936. But I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It rocked! Very fluid camera moves, great special effects (especially the dogfight sequence) and a fast paced story. I tried imagining what it was like to watch this in the thirties -- what a spectacle -- it must have been  urlLink The Day After Tomorrow  of it's time. The story runs a little out of steam as mankind moves into its utopian existence, but the first 2/3 is impressive. (Although B-- and I couldn't figure out for the life of us why someone would want to start a revolt because of "progress." Anyone have any ideas?) It's a shame that the film has fallen into the public domain. This is a film that deserves a better presentation than the awful print used to make the DVD!  Our second feature arrived in the mail today:  urlLink The House That Dripped Blood . I had a full house for this one -- my wife and kids, B-- and D--, a guy from church. I'm not sure what they all thought of it -- after all, Amicus Films are an acquired taste. But they seemed to enjoy it well enough. Me, on the other hand -- I love  urlLink British horror flicks , no matter how corny or implausible they get.  Well, B-- isn't off to college for a few more weeks -- hopefully we can get a few more double features in before then!
