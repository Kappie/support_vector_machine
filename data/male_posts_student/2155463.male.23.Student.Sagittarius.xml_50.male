I have to admit, I'm kinda lost at work...Lani is pretty much taking over all of the daily tasks, etc., so I'm pretty much just a consultant - I feel like I spend most of my time looking for things to do.  Oh well...I suppose that there are worse things that I could be doin.  Speaking of things to do...I suppose that I should start finishing some law school applications.  I've honestly been getting SO MUCH mail from law schools recently - for some reason I think I've gotten something from virtually every school in the state of California.  Anyway...I guess I should start knocking some of these bad boys off so I can get some acceptances back, eh? ;)  OK, time to go get Pirates of the Caribbean from Jay so my little bros can watch it over here...if anyone is interested in catchin a movie over break, we got a kickin' surround-sound system recently :D
