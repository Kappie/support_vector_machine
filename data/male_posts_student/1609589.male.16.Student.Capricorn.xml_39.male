I felt honored. Unfortunately, noone at his work had a DVD rom or player so they cant play them, so hes just gonna give em to me. HA!  Every review on the new Blue Man Group rock tour said that it wasn't as magical as the original show they had. For one, the theater is HUGE now, so you don't get the great up close look that you did before. I know, i know, they were trying something new, but BMG is one of those things you need to feel that you are kind of a part of- even if it is a fairly small one. After the performance(the original one), the performers stay in character after the show so people who went in can shake hands, get a blue high five (one girl i know even got her cheek kissed by one of them- it rubbed off soon after...), things like that, but if they were to try that after the big concert, it could take hours, and dissapoint some people that wouldnt be able to see them.  That's it for now. I'll post back soon.  Again, thanks to all of you who read this.
