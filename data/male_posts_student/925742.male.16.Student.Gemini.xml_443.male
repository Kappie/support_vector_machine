There was this newspaper box and on the glass viewing part, it was covered in the word "LIES" which was hilarious.  I spent a lot of time with Derek, though, at the community center playing pool, and at this dinner potluck we went to.  Also talking to his hobo friends (Nostradamus).   I had some people visit Sonja's genetics lab, and it was a good learning experience.  Mr. Forsee was pleased to see how his teaching molded an excellent scientist.  I got a little S'd after I ate some funky Buddha brownies and cookies and stuff, and then I crashed at Sonja's and played virtua fighter 4 with Derek.  I also got punched by a drunk person.  I was S'd and couldn't really help it.    On the way back Mr. Whaley was thinking of the exact same thing I was at one point, describing the worlds most costly speeding ticket.  Weird.  And Minh advised me to re install kotor.  I'll try, he is fairly knowlegable. Ok, later guys, better post tomorrow.
