I don't recommend going to the cinema to watch it, but I recommend you watch it somehow (you know what i mean, tsk tsk), just for the fight scenes, for they were pretty neat. Apparently it is also historically incorrect, too. Nonetheless, it beats Gladiator in terms of nifty duels and barbarian fighting. I thought Achilles was the shit.  The only odd thing that I kept having during the movie was picturing Hector turning into Hulk and stepping on the greeks. (Sorry, but as you may know, Eric Bana was the guy who played Hulk, and since that was where I saw him first, I keep associating him to that movie, which was pretty shitty by the way -- though his acting was fine.)  That's all I gotta say about Troy. (I won't tell you about the trojan hors.. oh shit, sorry for spoiling you a history book.)     urlLink Spy Kids 2    Just watched it. Fun movie. The CG could've been better, but it was still 'okay'. The storyline was fine, and so was the acting. I really liked the scene with the skeletons, which was a clear reference to a battle scene in a very old movie called " urlLink Jason and the Argonauts ".  PS: I thought Antonio Banderas' English pronunciation was a little better. At times he sounds a little bit odd. (Yes, I do know his main language is Spanish.)
