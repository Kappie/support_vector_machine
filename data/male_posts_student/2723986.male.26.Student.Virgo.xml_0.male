Now all I have to do to is survive two more tests and the final and I’m good to go.    A rousing game of  Double Dash!!  is sounding pretty swell right about now, so I’m going to cut this entry short, but I’ll add more later if I can muster up the motavation.   Quote of the Day    ”Don't mock me, my friend. It's a condition of ‘mental divergence.’ I find myself on another planet, Ogo, part of an intellectual elite, preparing to subjugate barbarian hordes on Pluto. But even though it's a totally convincing reality in every way...I can feel, breathe, hear...nevertheless, Ogo is actually a construct of my psyche. I am mentally divergent in that I am escaping certain unnamed realities that plague my life here. When I stop going there, I will be well. Are you also divergent, friend?”  – T.J. Washington from 12 Monkeys
