Many of the wars mentioned in the e-mail were started long before America sent troops into battle. Many of them involved many other nations in the world before America joined the effort.  ...Germany, in fact, did attack us. Anyone remember the Lusitania from history class?  ...Germany, Italy, and Japan were allies. Going to war with one was going to war with the others. There wasn't a choice in the matter. No matter what the Bush Administration or Faux News tells you, it’s a proven fact: al-Qaida and Iraq never had a link, much less an alliance. (See the  urlLink 9/11 Commission Report .)  ...Germany was an imminent threat. Iraq was not. Iraq's real-life threat-level was nowhere near the level the Bush Administration projected. If we are to take any hint to former US chief weapons inspector David Kay's remarks at his retirement, or former UN chief weapons inspector Hans Blix's assessment in his latest book, or even listen to Bill Clinton, we can see how both Bush and Blair misled their respective publics into war and why we will NEVER find any WMDs in Iraq.  …When we look at past speeches from our President, most notably the 2003 State of the Union Address, we see that Bush not only used faulty evidence to justify the war, but he knowingly cited unfounded claims to the American public. Why is George Tenet, the former CIA Director- a man who told the Bush Administration days before the 2003 State of the Union Address to take out specific unfounded claims in the speech- not in power? Why is George W. Bush- the man who left the faulty evidence in the speech and knowingly gave an address of deceit to the American public- in power?  ...Vietnam is looked upon today as a grave mistake.  ..."Once upon a time, Europe looked to the United States for stability. Remember how Clinton helped stabilize the situations in places like Bosnia, Kosovo, and Northern Ireland? Europeans expected strong, intelligent and sane leadership from the United States, and they got it. With Bush in office, Europeans miss the good old days when the U.S. had an educated, clear-headed president. Bush is confused. You never know what's next. The terrorists came from Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan and Pakistan, so Bush bombs Iraq and sends most of his troops there. North Korea not only has weapons of mass destruction, but brags about them, yet Bush simply shrugs his shoulders because his troops are too busy in a wild goose chase in the Middle East to do anything about it. Meanwhile, al-Qaida terrorists kill innocent civilians in Spain. What's the Bush logic? As long as he's fighting somebody somewhere, he must be doing the right thing."- Chapter 126 from  urlLink the Boo, Boo Bush Book .  ...Clinton was impeached for putting his dick in the wrong place and, God forbid, trying to get away with it. What do you think would have happened if Clinton went to war to capture a man the American public barely knew? I'm sure there wouldn’t be a complaint, much less a crusade, from a single Republican, right? (At least he tried to focus on the al-Qaida and Bin Laden threat, and compared to other leaders, sufficiently did something about it. He warned the next President of the United States of the threat, but if Bush wasn't going to listen to his own Counterterrorism czar, what chance did Clinton have?)  ...Democrats own up to their mistakes.  ...The liberation that Bush speaks of is not the same liberation that injured, deceased, and tortured Iraqi civilians know.  ...Bush is seemingly able to “crush” the Taliban and “cripple” al-Qaida, but the mastermind behind the worst incident of mass murder America has ever known is still at large. Of course, diverting essential equipment and troops from Afghanistan to Iraq didn’t help. (This all rings true, of course, if Bush doesn’t further play politics with national security and pull Bin Laden out of his hat in the nick of time. High-level al-Qaida officials are already starting to “show up” at  urlLink convenient times .)  ...stating Bush put weapons inspectors in Libya, Iran, and North Korea without firing a shot doesn't make it so. Did I miss something or is this just a flat out lie?  ...Taking cheap shots at Democrats in the context of the e-mail is not relevant in the slightest, but why should I be surprised? This kind of low behavior is right on par with the Grand Old Party. (Anyone remember the Max Cleland fiasco in 2002? Anyone remember how the Republicans exploited terrorism and Iraq to defeat the disabled veteran?)  Our Commander-in-Chief is doing a great job? The military moral (sic) is high? George W. Christ...
