I think I could seriously find that rewarding.  I'm at work, things are alot calmer today.  I'm going to lunch with a finance guy from emerson/ssg and robert is going to.  The guy is taking both of us to lunch for...i guess our help with his bank software.  MiMi is off today.  I hope she is enjoying it.
