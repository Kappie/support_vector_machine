I couldn't sing or act (no change there, then) for some reason, and I wasn't feeling well, so not pleased with that in all entirety. Oh well.  Also, phoned Fi, for someone to talk to - my working was thus; Too late to phone Lawa at half 9. Nikky is busy, apparently, and it's too late to phone her. Fi is usually up 'til about 10:30. So I phoned her, and said "Hi, is Fiiii there please?". The reply? "Chunk. Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee" Thankyou, someone who probably wasn't Fi. This is me not being incredibly pleased... once again, oh well. I assume it was not workable it was me. If it was, then... whoops, Jon's buggered up somehow.  As usual, there's an upside - talked to Naomi (Cosette) a bit, and she seemed nice, and she's getting a lot more confident at physical acting, and it's just nice to be able to meet someone. She's nae on MSN, but still, she asked if I had a mobile. Damn you, techno-age. GIVE ME A MOBILE!!! ACTUALLY, DON'T! PLEASE! I'D LOSE IT AGAIN!  Love, Jon Roskilly
