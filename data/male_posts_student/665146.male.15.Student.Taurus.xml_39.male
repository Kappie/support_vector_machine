There actually is something so creepy that it sounds like a conspiratory, when it isn't, in your video games.  It's known as the Military-Nintendo complex.  Various game companies have collaborated with military officials to create the most violent, brainwashing (I couldn't think of a better word), addictive, and entertaining games around.  They can bend the truth very far, but can never ever say anything bad about America, its government, or anything it's done.  Companies have had their people go on previously secret aircraft carriers and submarines to take information on engines, weaponry, exits, and every nook and cranny.  What would get a spy hanged for espionage is now keeping war at the fingertips of millions of glassy-eyed kids sitting at their computer in a dark room.  (Gee, that sounds familiar........)  For example:  SWAT 3: Tactical Game of the Year - Takes place in Los Angeles in 2005, yet this country still has the zeal that we did from post-9/11 and everyone in LA has a heavy Southern accent.  All the enemies are communist radicals.  There's something else about this game that's unusual, but I can't quite put my finger on it.  Besides that, the game is the violent, realistic, and ridiculous.  Soldier of Fortune:   " The hunter becomes the hunted... You’re the world’s deadliest Soldier of Fortune and your mission is clear: survive. Track your prey across the globe in a series of secret missions to take down a fanatical terrorist organization... before it takes you down. Maintain your cover as a covert warrior in a startling variety of explosive missions - ranging from underhanded sabotage, to stealthy assassination, to full frontal assaults - where skill marks the difference between the hunter and the hunted. Welcome to the secret world of mercenary combat.  Based on the popular mercenary magazine of the same name, Soldier of Fortune is a hard-core action first-person shooter, based on a heavily modified Quake II engine, featuring Raven’s own state-of-the-art GHOUL rendering system. Soldier of Fortune immerses the player in a fast-paced, story-driven roller coaster ride, from beginning to end. "  I don't even need to tell you about that one, that's just fucked up by itself...  Some of you may be thinking, "Now Nick, what's all this nonsense with brainwashing???  They're just games, you silly little conspirator  :D"(And if that voice you heard that from was as sweet as the one in my head, you'd be sick, too.) I'd say, "GET IN THE CAGE, MONKEY....  NOW....  NO, QUIET!!! NO...   NO  "  Then, I'd calmly tell you that the game Wolfenstein 3D has been clinically tested for increasing "aggressive tendencies."  I'm not denying how much fun these can be; I'm just a little scared.  In all the games that I've seen like this, the guy you play as (because the women must be too smart to fall into this mercenary shit...) always seems to have a Southern accent...  Will the South rise and crush the United States with its superior gaming knowledge, increased aggressiveness, and weaponry designed by GT Interactive???

Note: Nick, in no way, has anything  against  the South (except slavery, the Klu Klux Klan, and country music) and in no way believes that people in the southern part of America are bad people, they just have a bad reputation.  Nick hopes the South and him can party once they get rid of the KKK, all the confederate flags flying around, and Kid Rock...  Thank you...  Go America......  A simulation game brought to you by Raven Software, GT Interactive, and Activison.  In stores now.
