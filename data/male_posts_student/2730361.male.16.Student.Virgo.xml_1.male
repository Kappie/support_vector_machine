It is a phrase that tries to say that you cannot hurt me with anything that you might say. In a way this is a truth. Talking in a strictly physical manner the words cannot hurt anyone, they can however hurt peoples feelings and even permanently scar them. This is a terrible way to hurt people broken bones heal but hurting someones feelings is a very serious matter. I have been bullied since i was in elementary school so I can sympathize with anyone who has gone through this and while it has many unwanted side affects such as the emotional damage and scarring in my case is has also caused a hardenning of feelings that can also be unwanted but that can also be seen as a preperation for what is reffered to as the real world because unlike our sheltered existance with our schools and living with our parents we will be on our own and be exposed to things that we have never experienced and will be exposed to the harsh realities of life. So even though we preach that we should protect our children from all emotional damage it can help if the child is raised with the propper temperment and with caring parents to help them through it.
