I will probably send out an invitation E-mail separate from this post, which people may or may not see, but I just wanted to let you know so you could cancel all your other plans.  I'd love to see you there!    2) It's hopefully my last traditional corporate Monday ever... Hooray for me.  Boo to fancy corporations and their Herman-Miller chairs.  Boo!
