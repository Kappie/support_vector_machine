Tied with yi!] !! 15/20.. [so-so] =pp   ...bought a Senior Tie today~ need it for stage Band 1 uniform~ i feel so special now ^^  ZOne Athletix Carnival was such a... failure -___-''I don't like saying that i suck, so i'll just go blame it all on the weather, which is very true, isn't it? hehehe  Okay, before I marshalled for the High-Jump~ it was already raining, so it got partially wet... then when it actually started~ it was so.. slippery!! I didn't want to slip and stuff like i did at the school's Athletics Carnival, so i took it slow and safe =) 400m, had to compete against scary, drugged running freaks ~RESULTS: FAILED! haha~ not gonna say much more than that, coz it's quite depressing.. =( oh well, not like im a serious runner/ jumper or anything ^^ The only thing i got out of today was the knowledge of how to use a starting block! oooh, sooo pro ^^V!  that's it about the zone [notice that i didnt mention my exact results] =p  seeyaz.. on Tuesday~!
