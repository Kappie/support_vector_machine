I'm sorry I can't be prefect.  Ever heard of the saying Jack of all trades, master of none? Know any? If you rea reading this now, chances are that you already know at least one, which is me. I am moderately good at studying, SUCK at sports(I have no stamina whatsoever, can only swim 1/3 of an Olympic-sized pool) and much to the disgrace of guys out there, am no good at computer games(well, at least I still beat my two elder sisters at them, haha, coz they don't play much, if at all...).  There is only one thing I can think of that is to my advantage : My promises and keeping them. Luckily I make promises and keep them, or die trying. That's like the only way to make me get off my butt and do something. If not I'll just sit there and rot or until my stomach growls or I need to go to the loo and so on and so on.... hahhaa.....  Well, I was feeling a bit stresed out last night, so I had to go down to the swimming pool at the hostel. I always go there when I am stressed out, it's quite cool there at night although there are some mosquitoes there. Since there were some couples sitting there already, I went to sit near the BBQ piut area, also near the pool. That didn't go really well, so I walked around the pool. My roommate and his gf were there. I saw them the instant I came down, but didn't want to disturb them, so I didn't call them. The gf saw me as I was walking around the pool and miss called me on my handphone. I waited till I got back then messaged her, telling her I already saw them. Sometime after that, my roommate came back and told me that they thought I looked as if I was going to jump into the pool! God forbid! Haha....  That's all for now. I'm sorry I haven't posted for so long. I think it will be quite some time before my next post because I have some catching up to do on my studies, just waiting for the bomb to explode when my parents find out about my results...
