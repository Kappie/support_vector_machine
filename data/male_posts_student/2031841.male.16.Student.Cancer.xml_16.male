For instance:  movies.  Some movies barely break even, often because people go to see the movie out of curiosity.  If they can download it off of the web and don't like it, they don't go see the movie.  For some movies that can be really bad.  For others, like big movies such as the Lord of the Rings, it makes little difference.  Then there's music.  I've bought CD's (Yes, I'm admitting) because I downloaded MP3s, liked them, and wanted to hear the music.  It's tough.  And what about TV shows?  It's possible to record and trade them, and it's not illegal.  On the other hand, I've heard lots of porn is distributed through file swapping programs like Kazaa, so that's not cool either.  It's tough.  Some of those things on those file sharing programs, like Kazaa, ought to be shared.....It's even legal!  Other files are illegal, but it's common sense to share them and nobody cares.  Then there are the files in question.  They are illegal, and people take sides.  Some people think it's okay to share them, others don't.  Then there are the ones MOST people agree should not be shared.  That's a broad generalization, and obviously SOME people think it's okay, but, at least, most people  I  know agree that porn is bad.   Anyway, that's my take on things!
