HAHA, but that's not me! i'm efficient!!! i did ECON meanwhile!!!    now that i read the blog, was surprised to see irene posting something. heeehee, it's all abt the 1st 3 mths' recap. Ya, that time was fun during GP. It's always Carrom, Carrom and CARROM!!! But didn't matter lah, Mrs Nair usually tok crap.    Ha, irene, i dun rmb the part on me singing on a table???!!!??    k, todae there's racial harmony day celebration. We gals signed up to take part in some designing competition. haha, shame on us, din bring anymaterial at all. So,since the theme was sth to do with flowers, i went ard the school to pluck them. hee, i think it was fun. PLUCK-AND-RUN! heehee,Best frends were like the creative directors, seeking ways to improvise. haha. but come to think about it, the whole competition was stupid and purely a WASTE OF TIME, PrEcIOUS TIME!the chem pra was fun ( of cos not the part when she held back the class to go thru chem paper) cos we got the chance to deal with SiMplE ExpErimeNtaL PrOceDuREs.    Manda, i truly stand on ur side that Nus needs occassional sCoLding. Like todae, she PurposEly held me back to wait for her to complEte Physics Pra.
