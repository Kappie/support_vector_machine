Now that the hard shit is over, i say we all go out an enjoy the fruits of our labor, aka go out and be sociable. ive been doing my part in the "go out when bob is not here" department, where is everyone else? This weekend, everyone better have a story to tell about how awsome there saturday night was, or how they had such an awsome time watchin the superbowl. If you dont go out becuase you chose not to, well thats another story, but remember, a hermit crab can only move into a bigger shell by going out and getting it (whatever that means, i just made it up)  Make [SMUT] proud Darin P.S. By going out i dont mean waste all your money on alcohol or drugs, especially if your not into that. hanging out with your friends and doing fun stuff is just as cool.
