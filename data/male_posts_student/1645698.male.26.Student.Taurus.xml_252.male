If you, for some ungodly reason, still wanna use the Limewire network, head on over to  urlLink Unite the Cows  an excellent p2p portal, and pick up your very own copy of "Aqualime," a spyware-free Limewire! Now stop being such a douche, and head over there RIGHT NOW.  EDIT: Unite the Cows makes you sign up, if u wanna avoid this pain, go to the  urlLink Aqualime Homepage.   I'm Deadinside, and that's not all....  "Oh so there's a real 'Paris Hilton'?....Do they allow umm....double occupancy...at the 'Paris Hilton'?"
