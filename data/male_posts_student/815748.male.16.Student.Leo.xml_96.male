However, I didn't sleep a wink, though I finished beaucoup de French homework.  Charles de Gaulle airport was just as I expected it to be: futuristic, like Logan, but dirty futuristic.  Le Massillon was not that bad, though I could understand like 0.000000000000001% of what people were saying.  Arnaud, my host guy, is pretty cool.  I keep talking in English accidentally, I really need to immerse myself more.  In The Al Blog's grand tradition, here is a quote from Civics, my favorite class so far:  "Les juifs ont des nez longs..."  (The Jews have long noses.) --- M. Guyont  Well, not great, but whadayagannado.
