I hope she liked it...I think she did. Both yesterday and today in 4th period people were crying...I felt really bad. Samantha was crying like crazy both yesterday and today...I mean it is sad but I think she might be over reacting a wee bit. She only knew Stacey for like half the year and she is acting like her best friend just died...oh well everyone is different I guess lol. Then in 5th we were doing our Japanese dialogues at the "cracker table" and all of a sudden she started to cry....I felt SOOOOO BAD. Oh yeah and in 3rd period we were having WWII with paper balls lol. Tim W., Tim P, Alex, Canh and yours truely were running around the room throwing paper at each other...we were like rolling behind desks in stuff....it was a lot of fun....man I am gonna miss all of this crazy shit :( So in 6th period Nick Dexter who is black had to go to Mr. Carter so she was like u better have Mr. Carter call my room to let me know you are there or I will send my "posse" after you and both me and Tim were like she's gonna send the klan lmao. So today was pretty eventful...tomorrow is Wednesday...shit....
