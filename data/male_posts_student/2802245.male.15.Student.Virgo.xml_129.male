As for Beckett's post...what about capital letters in the title? ^^  I've done my first ever sprite flash (13seconds) and when I finish those articles, I shall get to work with the latest Wanderers flash movie, featuring Rhue aka Mr Blue. Just need time...and some morale to get to that 1 min+ requirement for each movie ;_;...  And I shall close with the remark, "Change is inevitable...except from vending machines."
