People that perform such stupid acts make me realize that I'm better off in this world than I think I am, and that is a great feeling to have.  So just today there have been a number of stupid things going on.  Here is the list...      1.)A man was arrested for driving his lawn mower drunk down the street.  He is now being held on $50,000 bail.   2.)A company gets broken into five times. This company hires a security company who installed a video surveillance system. The security guards forgot about video surveillance system, and decided to break in. Needless to say, they were thrown in jail.   3.)People are saying that Vampires are apparently roaming the streets of Portland.   4.)Don't make the same mistake that these dumbasses made... When selling exotic animals illegally, do not hang a sign on the front of your store that says "live exotic animals".   5.)A man spent $28,000 at a strip club, and he still did not get laid.  That is just plain sad.   6.)A Building contracter hired three firefighters to burn down a $1.5 million house after the owner refuses to pay in full. Hilarity ensues...   7.)And a man was fined $312 for "driving" a donkey drunk.  That is just today...
