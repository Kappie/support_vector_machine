Anyway I come back to blogger.com for the first time in around a month and they've totally redone  everything . That includes adding a whole bunch of fancy new templates which I think I will use from now on. The old one was nice but a change is good once in a while. I don't really feel like writing a new template so this will have to do for now.  What's new? My prom is in two weeks and I need a summer job, desperately. That's what's new.  Here is a picture of some  urlLink ducks.   :(
