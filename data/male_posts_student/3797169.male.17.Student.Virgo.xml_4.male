So we're supposed to go and check out this Ranchero, 1957, that my mom's friend's mother in law is giving us, if we ever get out there. It doesn't run, but that's not a problem, a few small items, maybe 150 bucks and it should go. But I get home..."what time are we going out to see the Ranchero tomorrow?" "We're not goin' out there tomorrow..." WTF!?!      Then, I get to the office and switch on the comp. just to realize I missed 3 hours of badminton. It doesn't sound bad, but it was the last day, and the only day Nate showed...Of course it was fate. I had to take my mom's shit out to my dead grammas house, and I stayed a while, left the cell at home.      Then, while talkin to Cam, I realize...nothing we planned or talked about is ever likely to happen. Everything is falling to shit, and yes, I'm goin back into my depressed shit, and I doubt anything by the DJ could make me better. I'm never gonna move out, not for 3 or 4 years at least, well, that's if my mom remodels the house.      I doubt I'll ever go back to the auto shop, I don't wanna learn how to sweep the sidewalk, and clean up barf from a shit faced mechanic, and I'm not a very good errand boy. So there goes that.      I'm still waiting for Sonya to call about goin' to the beach today...a little late. So there goes that; yeah, we didn't go, Speedzone kinda takes a lot out of you.      Damn it..."Blues dead, Nicole hates me, Frank's divorced..." shit I feel like the Godfather. Except, I can't make it all good again buy beating the Dean at his own game.      Fate's a cruel bitch...but then again, "Payback's a Bitch, aint it?"
