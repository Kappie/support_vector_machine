She is with my mom in a convention in NYC.  What should I do about this behavior?  Oh, my!  Just stop doing it again and again!  It's that simple!  What was I thinking?!  I hate myself!  I know I would not really play them!  How the heck I buy them for?  You know, I've been really out of house for almost two weeks now...  Yeah, yeah, yeah, just keep giving myself excuse, I am sure I will be happy about next I commit a crime again.  How do you want to fix this problem?  how did you intend to do about yourself?  What should I do!?  What should I do?!  What should I do?!  What should I do?!  What should I do?!  What should I do?!  What should I do?!  What should I do?!  What should I do?!  What should I do?!  What should I do?!  What should I do?!  What should I do?!  What should I do?!  What should I do?!  What should I do?!  What should I do?!  What should I do?!  What should I do?!  What should I do?!
