First hour we finished up the MYMY movie. It was pretty good. I mean they caught the theif and everything. Then second hour we had to take notes. It was so boring. I hate notes. Third hour we made pretty stuff. See we did our worksheet and we got to make pretty boxes. I have to make sure I get a new sheet though because I messed up on the other one. Fourth hour was as boring as ever. I hate health. At lunch we ate and I had a MAJOR headache. I fell asleep for a while. Then Kirsten woke me up. THANKS KIRSTEN! (I'm just kidding and you know that.) Fifth hour we practiced for our chorus concert. We were so off key at practice! It was awful! Sixth hour study hall was freaky. We went to the LMC to scan the pictures and about half way through the hour the fire alarm goes off. Hilary Feldt gets up and screams, Katie throws the pictures all over the place, and Alicia Kloepfer throws the pen at Shanon. Within two seconds I was four feet off my chair laughing, shaking, and freaking out. It was actually quite hilarious when I look back on it. Then in English we had to take our test. It was easy but I think the sub screwed Connor Lind and I. O well. Then we had to read out of these odd books and Jordan Knox was being a screw off again. Almost all the girls in the class went in the hall to read cuz he was being loud and annoying. Last hour we worked on our homework assignment. It was so easy. After school I went to Desire`'s house until five o'clock. We ate popcorn and freezees and looked at magazines. I took some of her posters for my room and celeb book thingy. When we were going home I grabbed her crutches and crutched the way home. It took us like fifteen minutes to half an hour. It was kind of funny actually. When I got home I ate dinner. It was quite yummy. Then I worked on my celeb book. After that I crutched around on the crutches and got ready for our concert. Our concert TOTALLY ROCKED!!!!!!!!! We were so good! After our last song I was going to start crying because if you think about it it's our last song as middle schoolers. When we got home I just started crying so hard because it's really sad if you think about it. Then I got on the net and typed this and talked to Kirsten! What a great day!
