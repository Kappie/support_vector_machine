To be honest I am going to keep looking for other jobs where employers understand the concept of inflation, and fair pay.  I also have been thinking about friendship a lot, and trying to figure out why it's so hard for me to meet people I get along with.  So again I'm tinkering with my life so I can increase happiness, and decrease the bullshit.  I guess things could get worse, and no doubt they will.  I just hope I can get into McMaster.
