Without physical contact, we held a watery 40-minute conversation on a variety of topics, including prefered showering methods, his internship in Texas, and manipulative marketing practices of the hygiene product industry.  ChrisSinclair believes there are too many chemicals in body soap, so he vowed when he invents a new body soap, there would only be two ingredients: water, and soap. Soap to make the water soapy, and water to make the soap "liquidy." It's a good thing you have a 4.0 in mechanical engineering, because I doubt your success in the emulsifying agents industry. On a sentimenal note, I'm watching The Best of Christopher Walken on SNL. ChrisSinclair and I love him and I wish I could be with ChrisSinclair right now. I missed you even before you left my door.  I hope you're sitting down, because you're not going to believe this: Luke and I went out today. Yes, I know. We saw Shrek 2 in Brockport in a theatre full of children. At the first high-pitched scream, I wanted to shove my hand inside my womanly cavity and rip out my uterus.   While I'm in the habit of shocking all of you, Luke and I went to Taco Bell again. Third day in a row. We should get frequent-visitor cards, or a free burrito, or a roll of toilet paper or something. I'll talk to a manager about that tomorrow...when we go again.  Luke: it's going to be   so   busy at work next week. Me: Why? What's going on? Luke: My boss gave me, like, five things to do. Me: Wow, so now you'll have, like, five things to do.  Luke is the only person in the world who doesn't think I'm an asshole.   I wonder what tomorrow will bring. Oh, hey, more Luke! The days have just become fodder for my blog. My life is blog fodder. Blog Fodder. hee hee. Say it out loud. It's so funny. I mean it. Do it now. Blog Fodder. hee hee.
