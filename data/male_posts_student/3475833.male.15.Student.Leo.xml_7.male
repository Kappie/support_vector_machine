Amy WAS supposed to have a movie day, right? Well, It didn't happen, so I went over to Alyssa's. Great time as always. But then on Saturday we had, I'd guess you'd call it, a planned visit. So, I tried to separate them, but they kinda blended together. And I learned a few things while I was there too.       1) The phone is, in fact, evil and needs to stop ringing.      2) Answering simple questions on the phone can be, in fact, not simple. Especially under the influence on inhibitants.      3) Nancy knows all. Enough said.      4) Don't leave your pizza on the floor, especially if there is a hungry dog around.  I'll probably think of more later. Oh! I thought of another one already:       5) If you leave the basement door wide-open, there will be mosquitoes in the basement by the time you get back.  Good Times all around. The only bad part was, I still have to clean my room. Loo. I got away from it for those days, but it, for some odd reason, didn't clean itself. Ho Hum. What else is there...? On Saturday in the morning, had football, it's great to be back doing football, gives you a great feeling. Well, also on Saturday, Amy and Brad came by and picked up Alyssa and I and took us down to Sarah Campbell's grad party. Barely anyone there, but a good time anyways. Then we went and hung out a Deanna's, talked to her dad about Amy going into the Navy. Good Times again, I learned a lot about Amy's choice. Then she took the car-load to Pav's bought ice cream. (OH YEAH SUCKERS TAKE THAT!! I GOT FREE ICE CREAM!!!!) But then I had to pump her gas, no biggie tho. I STILL GOT THE FREE ICE CREAM!!! Then I went back to Alyssa and hung out for about an hour and then headed back home. Great day all the way.  Sunday was pretty mediocre. Not much happening, just went swimming all day. Got a sunburn on my face. Which kinda sucks. Cleaned a little. Gay stuff all the way.  And then today. I slept until noon, ate, cleaned a little, swam, went to football, ate again... Feeling great after football. I gotta clean some more tho. So, nice talking to y'all. I gotta go clean.
