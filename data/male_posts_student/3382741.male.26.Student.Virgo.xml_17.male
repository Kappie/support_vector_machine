I went to meet one that seemed most promising Wed evening (despite the fact I had no money - not even for gas - since he paid for everything).  Before I left I promised myself there would be no sex ... (you can probably see where this is going).  He was kinda cute but looked a little old (probably becuase of the drugs he used to do [but he has been clean and sober for years now]).  I was not over attracted to him .. yeah kinda cute .. fairly hot body .. but i didn't want to do anything with him.  apparently he did with me tho .. and he started kissing etc ... then one thing led to another .. blah blah.  and there in lies the most stupid thing ever .. i didnt want it .. i didnt want to do anything .. but i didnt stop him .. it was almost like i LET him rape me ...... but its not that becuase as far as he knew it was fine.  UGH what is wrong with me!?!?  OK well i don't plan to meet up with him again.  I am just tired of guys in general .. is that going to stop me from going out on dates ... no ...      cuz i am stupid.  nothing else is really going on.  working a lot as usual but not enough ... wasteing SOO much time driving.  bank things finnaly a little better since i got paid today .. but the negative balance i had will still leave me with practically nothing.  i am sposed to have a date sat with another new guy ... to go to movie .. but i dont really want to go becuase i met yet ANOTHER guy online who I already like better (see i am stupid, idiot, dumb, ugh).  but i will go becuase i agreed to it (and because i still love movies).  he does seem like a nice enough guy, but i am afraid we have nothing in common.  oh well ... it's ok.  i really want to meet the other guy i am now talking to, but it seems our schedule is just not working out together well yet ... if i didnt already have plan sat night we could meet then, but again .. oh well.  what i should probably do is just not meet anyone, not go anywhere, save all my money and work on getting completely over everything i have been through the past few weeks.  but that's no fun.  blah ....   blah ....  blah and blah....
