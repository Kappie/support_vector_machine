I think I am going to take a new picture of me, I just need to do a few things first, like post in my blog (oh wait, if you are reading this I already did that now didn't I?)  Today was an interesting day and I might tell you about what actually  happened  later. Right now I would like to share a song with you and do a little song interpretation and what it means to me.    So Close    I'm so secure. You're here with me. You stay the same. Your love remains here in my heart.  So close I believe You're holding me now. In Your hands I belong. You'll never let me go. So close I believe You're holding me now In your hands I belong. You'll never let me go.  You gave Your life and Your endless love.  You set me free to show me the way. Now I am found  All along You were beside me even when I couldn't tell. And through the years, You'll show me more of you, more of you   What I really want to direct your guys' attention to is the second verse. It says "You gave Your life and Your endless love."  This really struck me because I have been living the wrong life. Ever since I was maybe 10 years old I have had a problem dealing with what I view on the internet. I tried to stop once by completly unplugging my computer, and that worked for a short time, but then when I got really bored, I would just go onto my parents computer and look at pornography there.   Recently a friend (whom will remain anonymous, if he would like to be known who he is, he may comment on it) of mine had set me up for a prank. I was supposed to put in certain information about myself, and then I would be paired up with the perfect girl. (now I was pretty sure that this was moot and that it wouldn't really be accurate, but I never really knew how moot it would be) What ended up happening is they asked me a few personal questions: Do you masturbate? Do you view porn? I answered honestly to both questions (yes) and the whole thing ended up being a joke to get that information to my friend. Well, I confronted him about it and he helped me out.  He sent me to this website called  urlLink Setting Captives Free   (link opens in new window)  and I started taking the course for freedom from porn addiction. I have been doing very well in my opinion and I have started to step by step fight this addiction of mine.   I just wanted to let all of those know that I am not a perfect person. I am not "Mr. Christian" and I am not "Mr. Pure." I fell in this area  hard . Very hard.     Other then these things that I have struggled with, my day has gone pretty well. I had Tech Assistant, Biology and US History. I had a test in Biology and I think I did fairly well. I also have to remake a test in US History that I keep forgetting to do. GRRR I make myself mad sometimes.  I will continue to blog here because it is a place where I know I can express my true feelings and if people don't want to hear about it, they don't have to read it. For anybody who is reading, please please please post comments about what you read. Any questions and I will do my best to answer them. I really like hearing from my readers and I want to know what is going on with them. Thank you for your time, I shall talk to you later.  Cop: Do you know why I pulled you over?  Fletcher: Depends on how long you were following me.  Cop: Let's start from the top.  Fletcher: Here it goes: I sped. I followed too closely. I ran a stop sign. I almost hit a Chevy. I sped some more. I failed to yield at a crosswalk. I changed lanes at an intersection. I changed lanes without signaling while running a red light and SPEEDING!  Cop: Is that all?  Fletcher: No. ...I have unpaid parking tickets.
