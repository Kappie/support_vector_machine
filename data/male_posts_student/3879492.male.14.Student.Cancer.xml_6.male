Was it a test to see if Id give in, take all the things I said back and let you win? Inside I feel like giving up I cant take the stress that comes with this love stuff No longer will I sit here wondering what went wrong I will learn from my mistakes and everything I have I will appreciate Sitting here knowing my future and wishing that you'd be gone......... Author  I shall not tell
