I of course didn't get the T-Mobile job even though everyone went out of their way for me, having a DUI is just too much.  God damn DUI.  So instead of having a Job I like I don't have a job I like.  I've been looking for more jobs though.  Preferable in sales and not in a restaurant (god I'm sick of restaurants).  So that's the way things are.  School starts tomorrow and at that point I will probably disappear off the planet and this will probably be the only way to get ahold of me.  9 hours in a month.  What was I thinking.    oh but on a lighter side, saw 3 great movies this weekend.  "Love Actually," which was funny and sweet and just good on all sorts of levels.  Would probably have been better if I watched it with a cute girl instead of my parents but it was still good.  I also saw, "Miracle" which was good as any sports movie about underdogs that is done well is good.  And I saw "In America" which was amazing and basically beyond words how good it was.  If you want to know I cried through the whole thing and just was moved by everything in it.  If you can sit through movies without explosions, I know some of you can't (Paul), then you will enjoy this movie.  So I'm off to achieve a few more goals today and see if I can actually succeed at anything without someone dropping the hammer on me.
