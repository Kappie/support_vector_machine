It was very early.. around 6.  I was up for the paper route (last day, thankfully) so it was the right time since I just got my permit.  For the first time, I think I did pretty well.  That's what my dad told me, as well.  I didn't really make any mistakes other than driving a bit slow at times.  I suppose nothing's wrong with that though.  After all that I slept for a while.  I woke up to the largest gob of slobber on my pillow.  I was supprised to see so much all over my pillow.  I'm not exactly sure why I said that.  It had to be said.  No it didn't.  Who cares.  I went over to my friend Brett's house later.  Hadn't seen him in a while.  Was glad to have done that.  That's about it.  I've begun to notice that my blog posts are more like me explaining what I did each day.  It sucks, I think.  I normally would like to have actual thougs on topics and whatever's on my mind.  Not just what I do everyday.  I guess it all depends on what I'm thinking about.  I bet it also depends on when I blog.  Right now its 12:30 and I'm not thinking that well.  Right.  Night.
