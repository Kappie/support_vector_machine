It is a hotbed a rich corporate executives with perms (yuk), SUV's, $200,000 salaries,minivans, and homes with white picket fences. The American dream. Except all this wealth just makes the less wealthy parts of the world seem poorer, it makes anyone who has traveled south of Gilroy notice that this little corner of bliss is only rich because it sucks natural resources and labour from less wealthy climes. The whole place looksmorose and lifeless, with successions of track homes littered hither and thither, with trees which look fake and plastic and tree-like(ahem, don't sue me for plagiarism Thom, please?).No character, no vivacity just blue sky and falseness. There seems to be a great deal of keeping up with the Jones's and a great deal of pretension. My Dad and Stepmum complain all the time about my messiness and my unwillingness to help keep up the false shine on their floors which gives the impression that somehow they are worthy. I think the American Dream is very unwholesome, material acquisition just seems to be a very superficial way to fulfil yourself. But it keeps these people happy, for now. One day America will implode, but for today we must just countenance its tentacles reaching out and sucking the blood out of ordinary people. This country is what makes Stoke-on-Trent the tip that itis, this country pollutes the visions of the billions worldwide with its inexorable greed. Mass production methods have robbed millions of their livelihoods by introducing cheaper production methods to undercut those of ordinary farmers. Oh well, it's a rather pleasing feeling to know thatChina (I might consider that regimehypocrites, but none-the-less)will eventually do the same to America, but I suppose that the People's Republic will also capture America's economic pre-eminence and we will have another super-power which will be able to exert its will around the world in order to expand its markets. Ah well, a little competition is always a good thing, as they say. Anyway, I'm probably boring you with silly leftish-economics. I spent a pleasant day in San Francisco on Thursday. Because I don't have too many friends over here I felt the solitude press in against me, but they had a load of listening pods and an expansive import section (American music blows asshole), so I listened to my usual diet of prog-indie-pop-metal, the Pixies, Razorlight, the Killers, Franz Ferdinand, Muse, Lorretta Lynn, The Stills, The Cure and a plethora of other good stuff. Anyway, love ya'll loads  Mood: Need...... coffeeeeeeeeeeeee....... nooooooooooooooowwwzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZ Music: The wind (it's kinda bluestery), but earlier I was listening to Jimi Hendrix Experience - Electric Ladyland (LP) Quote of the Day:  "I can't listen to too much Wagner, I keep getting the urge to conquer Poland" ~ Woody Allen "Pigfirst, flowers later" (bleugh, it's a weird metaphor that I like) ~ kid on Dragon Tales
