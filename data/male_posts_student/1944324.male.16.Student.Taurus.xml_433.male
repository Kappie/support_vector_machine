MAKE WAY FOR DAY!  :D  Daniel will kick all of their butts to China-town because he could argue all day about the meaning of life in Greek (or maybe it's Arabic now?), French, and probably his made-up language.  He'd confuse Al Sharpton so much he'd end up being condemned to hell, but that's a-okay, because Day does't believe in all that!  At least I don't think he does...oh well.  He's a nice guy, anyway, and the only one of the four I've ever met.  Plus, Kelly's dating him, so that means a lot.  :D :D :D   The Betty-one looks drowsy!
