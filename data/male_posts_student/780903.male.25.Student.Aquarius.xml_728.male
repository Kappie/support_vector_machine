Along with "Spellbound," it's one of my top two movies of the year, no doubt.  If you write -- or even just if you read -- it's a great two hours spent, basically right there in The New Republic's newsroom.  Rich, compelling drama.  But don't take my word for it.  Read  urlLink any review you want .  If I felt more ambitious this evening, I'd write up something longer.  But instead of a movie review, how about a Thanksgiving review?  Or at least a Thanksgiving review template.  I'd like to propose my very own Thanksgiving Ranking System:  There are four key aspects to any Thanksgiving meal.  1. The Food (subcategories: turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce) 2. The People (subcategories: youth, adult, adult-plus) 3. The Conversation (subcategories: current events, sports, all about you) 4. The Aftermath (subcategories: bathroom, leftovers, personal grudges renewed)  Each of the three subcategories that makes up one of the "Magic Four" gets a score between -10 and +10, inclusive.  The scores are then added up and divided appropriately to give a score for each of the four categories and then an overall Thanksgiving Day score.    Again, if I felt more ambitious, I'd rate my own Thanksgiving.  But I had a good time, and nothing funny happened, so it wouldn't be a very interesting story.  Other people who actually have terribly dysfunctional families where holidays are a chore would be better equipped to wring comic value from their Thanksgivings.  Mine was solid.  Good food, no problems.  Go see "Shattered Glass."  Trust me on this one.
