Recently, three of the blogs I frequent expressed dismay with the world of blogging, whether it be the petty griping of posters, the repetition of comments and lack of creativity, or the  urlLink ever-present social structure  that the internet was "designed" to overcome.  My  urlLink first blog  was more of a channel to review movies and literature than a running dialogue, diary, or discourse on anything.  The writing was great, but it was killing me to review things on a constant basis, and no one seemed to want to join in.  So I moved from there to the more activist-natured blog.  And while I don't believe that my comments here make a bit of difference to how our elected officials lead this country, at least people have the ability to read this.    I have no idea how else to put this, so I'll go straight out:  to everyone who is upset at the world of blogging, stop your bitching.  It's not the panacea it was made out to be; neither was the ham radio, cable television, or the furbie.  I probably check my email twice a day; when I was an undergrad, it was so much more, and when I worked at the library at  urlLink UTA  it was more than that.  But really, if this machine were taken away, I'd miss easier communication and little else.    It sucks for me to write about the redundancy and mirth of this message I'm writing, but fuck it.  I keep writing.  You keep reading.  You invite your friends.  Larry Faulkner takes me for a steak dinner, and someone sends me nude pictures of themselves from their iCam.  It turns out to be Jennifer Birge, and I vomit in my mouth.  Isn't that why Al Gore invented this mess?
