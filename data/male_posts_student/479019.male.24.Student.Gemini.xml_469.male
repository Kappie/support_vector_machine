He says his memory is fuzzy, but swears he didn't try his Maxim line on Steff... haha... but I think think he did. Hopefully she doesn't ask about his experiences in journalism at Berkeley, 'cause then I'd have to further the white lies.  Maybe I should get my ass out of my seat and go to campus today to meet up with Minh-An. I haven't seen that girl since I've been back.  Wow I've been back for 1.5 months and I still have 2 more to go.  ***
