I chose volleyball for some reason (chelsea damn you lol) and then we get to play guitar so im gonna go pick up an acoustic this weekend for like 200 bucks. then school ended and i came home and my niece was here! so we played with her. Jon and steve came over and we just fooled around. then Chelsea and Natalie came over and we hung out until now. jon went home steve is still here and me steve and jon are going to go to my brothers apt. to hang and play guitar. Then there gonna sleep over my house.. i think steve might not be aloud but well see. ill leave another one tonight. later
