All this anti-cheating just sounds like a challenge to me.  So here's the plan for u.s., we all fabricate test booklets, replace them with the real booklets when our booklets get picked up, and mail the originals back to the College Board.  Our goal is to have to take next year's tests in facilities with prison-like security.  We'll call it operation Rebel Yell.  Anyway, one day you'll look back at high school and just admire your naievity and such, and you'll be pleasantly nostalgic, at that point you'll buy yourself a Harley and hit the road for a couple months.  As soon as H.S. ends I'll be anticipating my mid-life crisis (maybe crises), because maturity and responsibility are WAY overrated.  ENJOY IT WHILE IT LASTS!  Carpe Dium!  Much love to all bloggers for making MY h.s. experience memorable  Love, Rob
