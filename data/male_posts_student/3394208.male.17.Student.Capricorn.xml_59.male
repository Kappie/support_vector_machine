But the question here is...  Why I do it? I ask and ask... Why do I do this, when i will be reminded of it Somehow, someway, hell...  Someday it will come out,  And in that time it'll be too late... Editing my life... I probably do this to compensate for yours Or maybe, i don't even have a life, So I add things that were never even there To keep you near me... just maybe... The thing here is sometimes I'm not even concious about it... Unconsciously, i'm already fucking around with you And what's weird is, i already am before i even meet you... And at the same time I'm also getting fucked By Me... Editing my life...
