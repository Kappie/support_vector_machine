After a week in Novgorod, the self-proclaimed most ancient surviving city in Russia, we spent a day in Moscow.  It was interesting to see churches and other buildings that were built in the 10th and 11th centuries.  Red Square was honestly breathtaking.  Petersburg is beautiful and distinctively more Western-European than Novgorod or Moscow.  Anyway, just a quick update...
