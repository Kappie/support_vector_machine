Why do farewells have to be sad? I feel sad every time I bid someone goodbye? Maybe it's because I love to be around people, so when people leave, I feel sad and alone. What do you think?  This is the last day of my attachment to Messrs BPN, a law firm at Damansara Heights, which is quite a good law firm in my opinion. All the people here treat me very nicely too.  They are not the only people who I am leaving today. I'll be saying goodbye to the two Singaporean girls I met a few days ago. They are 4  5 years old, but extremely smart and their command of English  knowledge is impressive. Amazing, the Singaporean education system, although expensive. Don't get started on the paedophile thing again!  So long, farewell, auf widerschein goodbye!
