If there is a God, why create the human race with all it's pain wars and suffering and not a race of beings that are graceful, with startling powers of telekinesis? Or, if we all sprouted from a pile of slurry in a hole in the ground, why was our 'soup' not evaporated by the scorching temperature of the earth all those millions of years ago? I get what we are, and I get who we are, but what I don't get, is why we are. That's what miffs me. I think that if people just stopped and thought about what a miracle\one in a million mistake we are, then we would all be better off. There would be less chavs for a start :-p But if you just look around you, at what we've done, you're sat reading this across the internet on a computer. A computer for christs sake. We evolved from the apes, why are all the other apes all still sat in the jungle eating each other's headlice? It just strikes me that everything we have we take forgranted.  I don't know where all this came from lol but next time you have a minute, just take it to sit there and think about all that is around you. Think about how lucky you actually are. You may think your life is a load of crap sometimes, but it's not really is it? (lol I sound like some old lady from Christian aid) but its true I suppose, we are so much better off than people in other places. I'm sat here writing this on a palm computer, you wouldn't get that in Rio de Janeiro...  Ok I'm going to lose track now because I've been writing this over the course of the past couple of days. It's just occurred to me how all this technology may not be such a great thing. If we had stopped at the telephone, and didn't use text comms, we could have saved on so much confusion. You just can't put enough emotion into a piece of text to justify its meaning. (he says whilst writing) A harmless quotient could turn itself into an unwanted accusation. This also shows how as humans we are so quick to judge, where sometimes we should ask if the meaning is not clear. What IS clear however, is the fact that reading the above shows that something has happened to think this. In short, yes I have made a monumental cockup. No change there then. I'd just like to say to the person concerned, (some of you may guess who this is) that I am truly and deeply sorry.  Finalmente, te amo todos. Gracias por tu tiempo.  Jim  x
