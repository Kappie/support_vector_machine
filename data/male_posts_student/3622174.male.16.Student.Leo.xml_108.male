Well, I had this series of blisters or something on a finger on my left hand, and one popped last night, and the other ones started to grow bigger.  So, I had to go and have them all cut off.  It's painful.  So, I'm going to NOT talk as much as normal tonight.  Oh wait.  Yes I am!  My driving days for drivers ed are on Monday and Tuesday, so Digital Lust is going to be closed then.  But, I'll still post here, maybe an audio post during the day while we're at lunch or something.  I'm probably going home with Alex, too, so I'll audio blog it from there if all else fails.  The second day, I have my senior pictures, and I'm debating whether or not to go to them now or wait until August.  It depends whether or not I feel like actually taking pictures, or flipping the camera off!    Later tonight, I'm just gonna post stuff.  No Late Night Bloggin', since I feel like I'm going to be overdoing it.  I've got XBConnect now, so I can play my Xbox online!  Only MechAssault and Midtown Madness 3, but, hey, its better than nothing.  Look for a review (hopefully, if I can get it to work) on Digital Lust tomorrow.    And that's it for this incredibly short post.  I'm gonna go stop the pain of my finger.  Bye for now.
