And that was our last practice for club...::gasp::..til the summer. But high school season is about to start in about 4 more weekz or so, and this has to b the best season the oxnard dudes will eva have...(cif champions). Hhhhhhanyways, our last tournament for club is tomorrow so i will sure miss those days wakin up at 4:45 in the mornin, but overall...i think we had a pretty decent season. Well i shall post somethin a little later...captain out
