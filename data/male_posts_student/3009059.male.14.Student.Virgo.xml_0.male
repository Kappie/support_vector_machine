What the hell happened?  Well okay. "We were suppose to comment on the gr. 6 and 7's portfolio's.  I passed Sir T's well developed embryo, and she told me to sign her's.  I signed it, 'cause I pitied for her.  I saw her signing paper, right smack on top of the paper...was the name...DARIUS!  I screamed, and screamed, as horror stabs through me.  A chill ran down my spine, and my pupil enlarged 2.4 X as it was to receive more light than ever...it was scary!  I backed down a few steps...and ran as fast as I could!  But I came back, because my class was still in there and I forgot to sign Hannah's portfolio."  Dimas, who was panic-stricken wrote "Darius first...hmm interesting...".  I myself did not witness such a crime.  But I do believe, or in Darius' words, "very cool", that there is something.  Oh yeah and I have to add something.  Hannah, if you're reading this...my comment said "nice effort"...well what I meant was the the 12.18 thing...ya know not that I'm saying that you put an effort and it's not good...I'M NOT SAYING THAT!  I'm just saying that...you put a lot of effort kinda thing.  You know!  We wish you all portfolioers to have good grades, and I hope that you guys hope we have great exam grades. -And I'm spent.
