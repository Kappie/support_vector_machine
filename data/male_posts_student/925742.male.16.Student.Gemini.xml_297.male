So yeah, I was listening to that song, Holy Wars, Peace Sells (all 3 by Megadeth), Fight Fire With Fire (by Metallica) and another when I wrote this:  Relentless  by  Wesley Smith 	 ~~~~~~~~~~  Man took up the club and hunted Man made fire to live easier Man built villages to share and live  Relentless to improve his live  Man took up the sword and killed his brother Man made steel to work his will Man built castles to hoard his wealth  Relentless to hold more power  Man took up the gun and warred in the name of Peace Man made homes to live in dreams Man built cities to enforce his rules  Relentless to stave off his fears  Man took up the machines and they did his bidding Man made himself arrogant to be strong Man built bombs to kill Himself... 							 Too late to relent, Man has gone too far.
