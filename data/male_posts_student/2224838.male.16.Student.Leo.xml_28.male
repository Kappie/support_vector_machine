As you can see, I haven't traveled much outside of Kansas. But on the bright side, I have been to nine percent of the United States!     Now, here is a map of states that my dad has visited, in sharp contrast with mine. It seems that my dad went all over the place in his youth. I know that he feels bad because he hasn't been able to take my family on vacations, but I love him just the same.   urlLink Create your own visited states map   urlLink Write about it on the open travel guide
