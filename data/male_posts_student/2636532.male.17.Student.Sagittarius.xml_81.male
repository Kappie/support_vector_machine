I knew after putting up the link that if anyone actually came to my site they would try my links and then you would be led back. You did a really good job on HappyDeath and made everything how you wanted it to be, it’s always been your blog more than mine. Not many people I know ever actually come to see my blogs so I really never cared to write anything because I knew your friends really wouldn't have wanted to see what I had to say since they had no idea who I was in the first place. I know what you meant about my blogs being personal, but I guess that’s why it really didn’t matter to me whether it was up there or not, since nobody I know comes to visit and they wouldn’t see what I said.  I should have told you sooner and I was going to as soon as I actually made my blog look somewhat nice. Right now its just randomly set up since whenever I play with the code it always screws up. I managed to screw everything up one time so bad that the whole page went down for a while. Going back and going through everything to see what went wrong is not fun whatsoever. So if you ever have time to help me with code for my blog I would highly appreciate it ^_~ My blog will probably always end up looking like crap since I’m way to impatient and html stupid to figure out how to get things all pretty like.  Thanks for letting me blog with you for so long. July 30th was HappyDeath’s one year! I came in on August 1st, 2002 and I guess my official depart will be today, although if Matt lets me I hope to come and post random blogging from time to time.  -  Dark Lily  0>--}---
