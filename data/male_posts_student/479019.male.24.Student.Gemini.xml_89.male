I still have to  Write about the Legion of Decency.  Go into more detail on the Left.  Write about the film's overall impact on Hollywood.  Do the conclusion.  Fine tune stuff... to make sure it all flows.  This all has to be done by Thursday at 3PM.  Oh yea... I'm seeing the  Hives  this weekend. I'm really looking forward to that. Those guys are awesome live. Much better than recorded... I've been saying that a lot about a lot of bands currently. Oh well... but that should be fun. I think that will pretty much end my concert goings until I go to Warped Tour.  Off to bed so I can make it to statistics tomorrow morning.  ***
