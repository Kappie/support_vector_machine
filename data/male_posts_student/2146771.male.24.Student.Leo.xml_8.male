There was just the typical work.  Brooke has classes on Monday nights so I usually get to work on my website those nights.  I did get another fish last night.  It's called a giant graumi or something.  I seriously don't think people that work at pet stores really know what they are talking about.  I tell them what kind of fish I have and they look at me like I'm crazy, 'cause I have fish together that aren't supposed to get along.  But they do.  I can't help it.  I just think someone has told them that they can't be together so they just believe it.  Ok, so now that's off my chest... hee hee.  Ok, I'm going to go 'cause Brooke just got here and we're going to eat lunch :)
