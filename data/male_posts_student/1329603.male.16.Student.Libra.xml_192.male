I want to stress something as clearly as I possibly can - I am not depressed. I am not sad, even. What I am is a little confused, and can it be said throughout the entire course of my life that there has been a time when this was not the case? I don't understand my feelings and I wait in perhaps my own limbo but no-one is to blame for this. I stress again that I am not depressed in any real way. I am not angry, saddened, nor dissapointed in anyone. My own feelings are to blame for how I am - and I don't believe that that is such a bad thing. It is better to feel and live than to simply exist.  Nothing's really... happening for me at the moment. Everything I was waiting for has gone, including Les Mis. Massive amount of PPD (post-production depression) after that. I guess that it is vaguely possible that I could be said to be waiting for the equivalent of a 'green light'. I hate to put it like that though. I'm just... sitting here, watching the wheels go round. I think whether my time comes or does not come is as of now something I have no control over, so I believe my best course of action is to take each day as it comes.  Quote of the day: "I'm just sitting here, Watching the wheels go round and round. I really love to watch 'em roll. No longer riding on the merry go round, I just had to let it go."  From Lennon's   Watching the Wheels go Round   Love, Jon Roskilly
