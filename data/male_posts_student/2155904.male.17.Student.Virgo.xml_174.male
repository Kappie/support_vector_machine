He went to lunch at 1 with Dr. Phil and Kinker at Subway and they ate some good eats.  Then they decided to go to QFC and cash Doc's scratch ticket and since Tyke had his monster coin bin he decided to cash that as well at the coinstar.  So make your guess in your head now before you read how much it is.  One last chance...$143.15.  Yep, incredible.  That is after the 8 and 9/10 percent that Coinstar takes out of every deposit.  So Tyke lost $13.98 to Coinstar but he did have 1491 pennies so he didn't even lose all his penny money.  He had 309 quarters and like 454 dimes.  It was insane.  Just insane.  He just about cleaned out the cash register he went to get the money from.  Or at least so said the man working there.  Then Tyke went home and did nothing for most of the day.  Just sat around, wanting to do something but not able to.  He tried to see if some ladies were free but nope.  So he kinda moped around longing for something to do.  Kinker and MSwa got a poker game going at his house so he was ready to play there again.  He went out for Chinese with his family and then came home just to leave for Kinker's house.  Tyke, Kinker, and MSwa were joined by DCups, Maniak, DUI, and Macaroon.  Tyke was down for a while at the beginning so he went all in but the river came a 5 and that ended up giving Tyke 3 pair because he had pockets.  So his pocket pair was the lowest and thus MSwa's kicker was higher giving him the win.  Then later on Tyke had KK and the flop came 3QJ.  Tyke bet big and bigger and then MSwa was all-in so it was just Tyke and DCups deciding who would keep betting.  Tyke bet big and DCups took forever but called.  There was another Q on the table and then a J came.  MSwa got excited and threw his JJ down on the table showing he had a full boat.  Tyke kept betting big and DCups kept calling after much thinking.  Finally DCups showed his AA and Tyke lost like 15 bucks on that hand.  It was monstrous.  3 hands with pockets.  The biggest winner had the worst pockets too.  Later on Tyke was in 3-way action with Macaroon and Kinker.  Kinker went all in 1.25 and Tyke called of course cuz he had about 35 bucks.  He lost and from that hand on he did not win until about 25 hands later.  He just kept getting chipped away and had good hands but got screwed by lucky draws or gay shit that just screwed him.  Macaroon ended up getting much of Tyke's money and it was not cool.  Then he left early too and cashed out Tyke's money.  So Tyke ended up going 1-1 with Kinker but they had been playing for about 5 hours so it wasn't that focused.  Tyke just went all-in cuz he got tired and lost so he ended up down 15 or 20.  Whatever, he still made money today.  But he came home and talked to Haras cuz she is home again!  And whoa, she just signed back online for some reason.  But yeah, today wasn't exactly the ending to break Tyke wanted (although break still technically has another day but it's a Sunday) but it was ok.  Tyke needs school to start to take his mind off things though.  But he doesn't want school to start at all either.  Such a complex situation.  Why can't this all be a little easier?
