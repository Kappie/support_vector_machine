How many years pass before the difference between murder and death erodes?  "Grief requires time. If a chip of stone radiates it self, its breath, so long, how stubborn might be the soul. If sound waves carry on to infinity, where are their screams now? I imagine them somewhere in the galaxy, moving forever towards the psalms. "  - Anne Michaels, Fugitive Pieces
