Well, despite not having the chance to talk to Laura... or Fi, coming to think of it... or Nikky... since Friday (Nikky since Thursday, come back Nikky!)... Fi and Ging are doing really well, it seems, so Fi's happy, so that has a reaction with me... I'm getting on OK it seems at Les Mis, we've almost done all of it now, and we've done where I get shot, so that's all well and good... I didn't do my trombone practice today so I'm not as nervous as usual (practicing highlights errors, so if I practice I feel like I'm going to do abysmally)... I don't have to get up as early tomorrow (doctor's appointment)... I guess the only thing wrong is that I am feeling... insignificant, I guess. Not extraordinary, just... mediocre in every sense. But even in saying that... I am content.  In a typical me-style, I am beginning to get a little obsessed with Olivia, who is playing Eponine... never mind, it's the voice, I tells ya... nah, this isn't quite like when I get obsessed with people in that I fancy them too much *coughs* it's more like I want to get to know her, you know? It's... odd. I know bugger all about her, but she seems nice... and she has a superb voice... and she dies in my arms... Ohohoh, at Les Mis, while it occurs, me and Naomi (Cosette) spent about half an hour trying to work out how to hold hands. Seriously... At first, we kind of just gripped hands, and it looked like we were going to have an arm-wrestle, then afterwards we did the "gripping the fingertips" thing... which made me look like I was in love with Enjolras (who I did seem to sing some of A Little Fall of Rain to, strangely enough, when Olivia wasn't there)... seriously, it's so much simpler with Olivia, because she's very much into the contact thing, which is nice. It's very unprofessional of me to say this, but I like her hugging me. I like hugs. I get quite a few, too, cause apparently I'm quite good at hugging... see, I'm not bad at  everything , just most things.  *sighs* There are times when being unprofessional makes you feel kinda... weird, you know... not that me being weird is in any way out of the ordinary.  Despite feeling insignificant lately, I've also been feeling very, very detached from everyone, like no-one understands anything about me. I suppose, in a way, that's true, because it's fairly difficult to know when to take me seriously or not. But... I love all my friends, some in more than one way, but even so I find it difficult to relate... to get close to anyone. It's not one of those "I don't want to be hurt" things, more an "I suck at getting close to people" thing. I guess it's the subtle mix of maturity and immaturity that makes it so hard to communicate.  Oh, but I will tell you all this, despite the fact it seems a bit cheap to say it on here rather than keep it to myself - I have made a pretty big sacrifice for Lent... I have given up chocolate, in no half-measure. White, Dark, truffles, chocolate yoghurt, chocolate mousse, hot chocolate... even Galaxy is out until Maundy Thursday. Why is this a bad thing? Because... I am a chocoholic. I buy at least one 400g bar of Galaxy a week, usually, and I tend to buy at least one chocolate bar a day (Wispa, Galaxy Ripple usually). At band, I have a Milkybar in the break, which they kindly give to me. I'm not good at not eating chocolate. I've gone half a week, and that's had serious downs - I realised on Wednesday that I would not be able to get any Galaxy Ripples when I got off the bus, and felt like jumping out of the window. Oh well, that took up a paragraph, somehow. Summary - no choc for Lent.  Just one final thing - there are ironies that exist that we can't face. When you want to be with someone who wants to be with someone (as in you want to be with [specific] who wants to be with [indefinite but not you]), that's going to be hard, and it's a situation that occurs a lot, I think we have to live with it. Ignore it, fight it, or crumble. I choose a mixture of all 3. If you're in the same situation, it's up to you to decide.  Quote of the day: "They say they follow the Lord's will, Still they'd torture, Still they'd kill, To help a young man reach his prime. They say he's cursed, he's Satan's child, I'm just a boy, Betrayed, defiled, All a young man needs is time... Damn them all! While they run with the pack! They will pay For the scars on my back!"
