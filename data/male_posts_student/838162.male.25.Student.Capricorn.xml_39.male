Basically Linux is another type of computer operating system, sorta like Mac OS and Windows. It has not been an easy transition. Installing and running it is not a problem, it's getting all the applications to work thats the problem. I think part of it lies in me wanting to get it to work like Windows. It's hard not too. I have been using Windows for a very long time. Before that was DOS and how having to go back to a DOS like environment, it's like taking a step backwards. But where it lacks in flash, it makes up for it stability and function. No more random crashes. Which makes me wonder again about what was the problem on my old system.  The biggest complains come from    >   of course. Not easy getting used to the new environment and getting all the applications to work. But as you can see, things are much better now.  Of course I still keep my Windows around. Games still run better on it and since gaming takes a big chunk of my processes, all the more that I should still maintain the best performance for it.  In other news, I've been hitting the books hard since sunday, need to make up for lost time suffered during the migrating of OS. On top of that, I have to make time to study for my driving test this friday . It's only basic theory, which I have passed in the army, but I shouldn't take it lightly. Better get it over and done with.     >
