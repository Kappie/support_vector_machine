He played a very stupid weatherman, and he did it perfectly. This movie had a ton of very funny parts, as shown by the preview, but the begining was very slow. I was also happy to see Ben Stiller cameo, and that Vince Vaughn also had a part. The whole news team (main characters was absolutely stacked, and some parts of the movie i thought i was going to choke i was laughing so hard. I give this movie:    ****  *
