If you want, we could hit a matinee showing of Spidey 2 on Wednesday or Thursday.   I haven't seen any of the Harry Potter movies... does this put me at a disadvantage in seeing the last one?  If not, I would be interested in seeing that tonight.  BUT... if you guys want to see a movie earlier in the day, we could always go to a matinee showing of Farenheit 911... it won't be $4, but it will be pretty darn close.  Lana... the Onion is perhaps the greatest literary achievement of our time.  I love their "Point, Counterpoint" pieces:)
