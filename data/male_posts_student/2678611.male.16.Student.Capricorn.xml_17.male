Mr. Lif - Avengers Lyrics   {Akrobatik + [Mr. Lif]} It's Akrobatik With the final fantasy tactics Eliminatin' wack shit [With strategy that's sick] Teaming with my accomplice who helped me on the Fat Shit We'll f**k your tower up With multiple power-ups My appetite for pain will eat a meteor shower up Crash a thousand crews [Grab a bite] and get showered up  {Mr. Lif + [Akrobatik]} You feel refreshed Now let's continue the quest I use a towel to Catch innards of those we disembowel for Foul play [Lif what did Colin Powel say?] Who knows? I had flood waters wash his ass away He was just another rabble-rouser from Babel's tower Living in the glorious realms of false power  {Akrobatik + [Mr. Lif]} I make you shake ya ass I make you nod ya head Plus give you the motivation To get your ass out of bed Cause to me, MC means Motivate the Crowd And eliminate the evil cause I know they hate the proud I blow the fakers out of the box with Hip Hop [They oughtta stop or watch they frame get chopped Or better yet they suffer from paralysis and shot] So if you feeling this pump ya fist when it drops yo  [Chorus]: Mr. Lif + [Akrobatik] The avengers Sent to tear down the terrorists Perceptionists [Who's that?] Ak and Lif [And you know that we're Attacking with the raw for sure] The earth [yo check it] get another realm to explore  {Mr. Lif + [Akrobatik]} At this point the predator blinks Knowledge rifles past the head of the sphinx The nation cringes as a terrorist thinks How to spike his next target But we're all americans here so our place is the market   Death to whoever tries to harm it We'll demonize you Provide adversity you'll never rise through We upgrade to downsize you [Who says we can't buy you?] Here's a dollar that claims faith in Allah Currency currently funding a holy war You'll only get a little cut So you know there's more We assure you that we're heavily in debt [I'm sick] Sorry we don't have the remedy yet  {Akrobatik + [Mr. Lif]} Yo I shower fat freeze On the powers that be So when they come to me with bullshit I devour that steeze Like tryin to charge a hundred grand for Bachelor's degrees And creating filthy air that be stifling the breeze And filling our TV's With these gold tooth wearing MC's Who probably don't even know their ABC's [But got cheese] But we all know that cheese goes bad and gets molded So my priority is wisdom for my head to hold it  {Mr. Lif + [Akrobatik]} The wicked get scolded [Their soul] They sold it They got a million ways to make sure that we're molded Along the same lines as those with no spines But the power of these rhymes is changing the times  [Chorus]: Akrobatik + [Mr. Lif] The avengers Sent to tear down the terrorists Perceptionists [Who's that?] Ak and Lif [And you know that we're Attacking with the raw for sure] The earth get another realm to explore  [Chorus]: Mr. Lif + [Akrobatik] The avengers Sent to tear down the terrorists Perceptionists [Who's that?] Ak and Lif [And you know that we're Attacking with the raw for sure] The earth get another realm to explore
