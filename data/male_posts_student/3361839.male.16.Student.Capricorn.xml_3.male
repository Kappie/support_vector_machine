And I have to go right now  The four two syllable words everyone has used, you can be sure that your not the first person in that of making inroads to the use of these fillers.  We start this journey off with eh the two words that mark when you just can not seem to come up with something to say or for that matter saying something that would be just downright rude.  secondly the um word, the thing you use when you just can't think fast enough so your thinker (brain) sticks it in to  give it more er time.  Er, the fixer syllable, commonly used as something shorter than "oh shit I said the wrong word."  And finally the most important one for the many of us who just cannot fathom the idea of listening to someone's entire sentence the first time.  Thats right its hu, it sounds like something from the land of saturday morning cartoons but you would be surprised how many times a day you here it.  An example of its use might be you walking into the office and seeing woman with these amazing boobs then getting all mixed up in them whilst she tries to explain to you something important.  Once she is finished you immediately trip over to hu?   Remember thats: -eh -um -er -hu
