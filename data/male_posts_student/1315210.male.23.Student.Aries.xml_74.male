I HAD TO BRAVE GREAT DANGER JUST TO GET IT~!!!!"  now that's done, on to my david and goliath story........... "In fair Tampines where our (a friend and myself) odyssey unfolds...............david met goliath........."  ok lah, abit unkind to call it david and goliath..........but.........wat the heck...........anywayz, we were wandering around century square in tampines looking for a metal chain necklace..........and we wandered into "Yellow"...........and this salesgirl approached us..........smelling the possibility of making a sale...........she turned on her persona knob to "Salesgirl friendly"..........and i, smelling a possiblity of a bargain, turned my knob (figuratively, NOT literally.....abit obscene if i were to do dat......and totally painful) to "Consumer friendly"..............and the exchange went on until we managed to pick one particular piece..........  i had requested she matte the piece of necklace cos it was too shiny and i would come back to collect it in half an hour's time..............so we left and returned.........she was still matting the necklace.........so we took a look around the shop somemore...............and i made a passing comment on how i wanted to buy a piece for myself but had no money.........  now this is the critical part...........and this is exactly what she said (translated from Chinese), "If you don't buy now, next time you won't be able to see me here anymore."  ya.........duh~!!!!!!! evidently she had turned her knob to "Looking for a guy friendly" and was hoping i would turn my knob to to same level..........anywayz, i jus dismissed the remark and pretended nuthing happened.........subsequently the salesgirl was too embarrassed to look at me while i was paying........ the salesgirl isnt ugly...........chubby tho........sweet looking lah...........BUT NOT MY TYPE~!!! and even if she was.........i was only looking for a sales transaction~!!  i do not doubt that im irresistably handsome.........but somehow or the other i seem to attract only females of the larger kind and those males unsure of their own sexual identity................it sucks~!  maybe i should have invited her to my friend's birthday celebration that night.........and introduced her to my friend as his present...............so i say again......... "YOU BETTER APPRECIATE THE PRESENT~!!! I HAD TO BRAVE GREAT DANGER JUST TO GET IT~!!!!"
