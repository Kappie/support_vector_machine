I also have  Netscape Navigator 7.1 , it's cool and have a lot of features, but the template start to annoy me. Firefox template is regular and can also be changed with customs so easily. Only a few flaws of html, like on Bb's forums .( 3Drealms )   Well, back from school, my mom made me angry right away. Let's hope i do not get disturbed for the next 5 hours, that would be nice. At intervallo i was in  Ana Eloiza 's class, chatting with some girls. I saw that girl named  Amanda , men!   I think i will continue my html lessons now.  Regards,  Zephyr
