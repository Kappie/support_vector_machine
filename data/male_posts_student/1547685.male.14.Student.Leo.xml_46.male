It was for our 8th grade grad party so everyone from school was there. Lets see....i had fun swimming, eating, and being abused by my shorter mom aka carmen. There was dancing, food, music, and also what i thought was really kewl was when they took a pic of us in front of a palm tree background. It was really hot at the start but then it cooled down (i think i got a little roasted). Luis was the champion of all the compitions which was really kewl. He got to represent the AP! After it was all said and done, I went to this Tapioca place which was really good. I had the Lychee smoothie with big tapioca balls inside. Tomorrow i have my last day of Jr. High.....going to a billiards place for 6th period and a party for 7th. blog later....im out
