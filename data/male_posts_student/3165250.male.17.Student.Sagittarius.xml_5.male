I then owned another cheapy bike which I used to putter around in life, you know, to and from school, around to get food and candy and the like. After saying "hasta luego" (thats Spanish for until next time) to that bike, I then mooched my father's relatively cheapy bike. This bike was put to some serious use. It saw all parts of the city, Brentwood, numerous trips around the Calgary reservoir, the bottom of the reservoir (an adventure involving failed brakes and unfortunate hijinx), Mount Royal, and so on. We pourd more money into fixing this bike then we buying it. So after a quoted $300 tuneup, I said good riddance. Being the lazy bugger that I was, I didn't even bother to pick it up form the bike store. I assume it is now becoming something greater in life, like a chain link fence post. I then mooched another bike off my father, a 1978 Raleigh. I will double check the spelling on that. This bad boy was retro. And in great condition... Because it was never used. I quickly put a stop to that. Now, unlike wine, a bike does not appreciate in value over time, so locking it up was never a huge priority. Just stash it behind a dumpster and go on your way. Now with all this money we saved on bikes, I thought it was about time I invested in a bike... A real bike. So after 3 months on my dad's bike, we went our separate ways and I bought Virginia. I might never own a sports car of any sorts so naming this bike is as close as im gonna get. Virginia is a road bike, a Devinci Apex to be exact. $899 marked down from $1299, I paid about $1100 in total. In addition to the bike, bought a kryptonite lock (to keep that fucker Superman's hands off my stuff) , a computer for it, a bell and other biking accessories.  Virginia is my pride and joy. I have no sorrows about getting up at 4AM when I know im gonna be biking to rowing on Her. anyhow, it occurred to me after i bought the bike that yeah, i could go somewhere with this (pun completely intended) and toyed with the prospect of long distant bike. Iv done two fifty kilometer on cosecutive days and my big project for this year is to bike to Canmore on a Friday and home on the Sunday. Thats about a 200 Km round trip. My almighty goal for next year is  The Golden Triangle.  Its a 3 day, 300 Km trip, starting at Castle Moutain Jnct and doing a round trip and arriving back where we started. Thats all for now. Ill keep this updated... i hope. Mack
