Instead of telling you about all of the not so exciting things that have been happening to me lately, I'll just rant.  The copyright board of Canada is following suit of the Americans and is now suing people for sharing files on the internet. Unlike the states, here in Canada, it is not illegal to download copyrighted material off of the internet, but it is illegal to upload, or "share" it. Half of my purchased CD collection, which is at roughly $500 since I started it in October (I've owned CDs before, but have always lost them or whatever, this is actually a "collection"), are from artists that I would not have known existed if not for Kazaa and Bit Torrent. Anyway. This rant is not about sharing music. It is about the waste of resources that is going on by tracking down the people who share music and video files. You know what would be a far better use of the same resources? Tracking down those who share child pornography. Let's face it, Pedofiles are a much bigger concern for society today than are music lovers.  Ok. Short post, but I'm done.
