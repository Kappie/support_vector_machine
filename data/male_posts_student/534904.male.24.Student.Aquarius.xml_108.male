I can't even ask a girl out for a casual cup of coffee and a chat - in an entirely 'this is not a date' way, mind you - without fucking things up. ugh.  Sometimes I wish life had a Rewind button. What would happen if I changed that one moment just a little? What if I never told my 'friend' which girl I had a crush on? Would I be a happy man now, full of self-confidence and a wonderful girlfriend? Or would she have found out some other way and destroyed my hopes and dreams anyway?  What if I'd actually made a move on that that other girl while she still had something for me? (I did not know this at the time, of course :rolleyes: ) What if I'd told yet another girl how I felt about her a week or two earlier?   All I want is to have a relationship with a nice girl. I would give up  everything  for a decent shot at that without screwing it up somehow. But I'm still right here, feeling as miserable as ever, feeling like there's this insurmountable blockage in my path and there's nothing I can do about it. Dammit, I  want  to heal! I desperately want to forget forever that  one small moment  where it all went wrong. Why can't I fucking get over it? Why is it fucking ruining my life like this? Why can't I dwell on a single tiny moment of happiness for my whole life?  What fucked up evolutionary advantage is it that causes us to dwell on negatives and not positives?  Maybe I should just wait it out, maybe it'll happen for me one day. Maybe this is just some kind of test, and I'll be rewarded with a fantastic life later. I don't fucking care! I'm 24, and all my friends are either in great relationships, or they're happy with being single, and have at least  had  a great relationship at sometime. What the fuck is wrong? Why am I subjected to such torment?  Maybe you think I should just quit my whining and just get over it and on with it, and I must say that I'm inclined to agree with you, but every time I try to do just that, I get shot down again into this vicious circle of self-doubt and fear.  I  will  face my demons one day, and I  will  conquer them. I just wish they'd agree to it.   I miss the comfort in being sad -KD Cobain
