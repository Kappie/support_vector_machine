Man this i will never forget!!! it was good fun but for some of it i had a pounding headache. for bit sit got better and i was able to be social but it always came back in really painful throbs. it had to be a migrane. then jamie hit me in the head with a really tough block of foam. well i did deserve it, that night i must have hit jemma so many times with various things. i feel so sorry for her. again jemma i am really sorry bout that.  on another note i played a really good practical joke on jamie. finally i got him bac for so much. hehehe, i am so proud of myself. well this is what happened. we are chucking crackers across the room, if you werent there dont ask, long story. but one landed on me and i saw that jamie was leaning forward and well my eye caught the fact that his boxers were showing clearly above his pants, so i jammed the cracker down his pants. he jumped out of his skin wondering what the hell just happened. so he pulled the cracker out and shoved it in my face. but i got him so good i didnt mind. the best part was that somehow cracker had gotton down his pants, he had to go get it out. like gone down his boxers. keeping in mind that i put the cracker between his pants and bloxers, and if jamie tells you different hes lying. ewan thought it was pretty good aswell.  beth and luke... well the only complaint i got between these two ppl are the appauling amount of sms messages they send each other. look i dont care who sends more cos the both of them say different things. luke 94 messages in a month, and beth easily more than 50 in a week and a half. either way its amazing how they manage it.  the things that jamie and his friends get up to is incredible. i so want to get involved. looks like great fun. personally i love practical jokes but never are able to do it, without getting someone angry. oh well, i got my fair share of them out in the winter sleepout last night and this morning. lsat weekend mike got initiated into the guys club, so ben the initiator got the crap kicked out of him. tom f was the last to be initiated. jeremy was the initiator in that case. tom got it pretty bad, uppercut to the equipment. feel the pain guys. on the same weekend jamie got his gooch vacuumed by dave lovel, man i am so proud of him. and the best thing about all of these things is that we at the winter sleepout got video footage of it all.  winter sleepout was great, good stuff guys, cant wait till next time..
