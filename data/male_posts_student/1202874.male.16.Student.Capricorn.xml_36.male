(this blogger is starting to have plenty of sexual inuendo) i guess thats good. two more to go. for some unexplainable reason mr. burnside had the snowboarding meeting today (october 22. little anxious buddy) and i guess it was kinda pointless. the large portion of the 15 minutes was spent waiting on emergency forms. exciting stuff. but afterschool we were all crazing a little bit of that digestive satisfaction (food) and went up to tom's house. that is except liz ( urlLink  ) who had some issues today but oh well. anyways we ordered up some delicious chinese food... what other country makes better food? everyone was funny for some reason so it was cool but i o.d'ed on that general tso's chicken. so we have a chem test tomorrow and angie wanted to study. i haven't hung out with her in forever. it was cool to see a new face (or rather old face since we used to hang out?). i was extremely tired so i fell asleep when she was researching online. but sleep is so good.  this weekend i'm suppose to go with the orchards, brian, mason, and mitch to pennsylvania. up until this week the enthusiasm was high for this event but recent events have shown that it might be a bust. the bare facts of the trip are we're going to a house from friday night to sunday afternoon, we're about an hour away from any stores, and the main entertainment is gonna be each other. the whole idea of non civilization bothers me just cause there will be nowhere i can walk off to if i get pissed off and stuff like that. then what if... and this is inevitable... someone gets into a fight on the car ride there and the whole weekend becomes in dire need of dr. phil to fix it all. then another guarantee is that there will be two or three groups divided the whole time. brian and liz (likely), mason and brian (probably), me and mitch (likely), liz and me (not so likely), and then christine. i can't really see where she'll extremely fit in so there gonna be some anger. just this weekend has a high chance of looking like a days of our lives.. ghetto style. but the possibilities if i stay home are to hang out with everyone thats won't be going... tom, angie, maybe amber, etc. and get a relaxing couple of days. worst comes to worst i end up playing video games and listening to billy talent. does that sound so bad?   whatever happens will happen, maybe i'm just looking for a reason to not go.
