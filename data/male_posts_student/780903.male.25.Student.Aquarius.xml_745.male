"They Didn't Get Elected" (The Supreme Court Justice song) to the tune of Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start the Fire"  Potter Stewart, William Day John Paul Stevens, Horace Gray David Souter, Stephen Breyer, Robert O. Grier  Fred M. Vinson, Nathan Clifford Harry Blackmun, not Frank Gifford Rutledge twice; second time just for one year  Henry Brown, William Strong Brennan served for very long Brandeis, and Byron White Clarence Thomas is far right  Joseph Story, John McLean William Taft was not so lean Rufus Peckham, Mahlon Pitney, Benjamin Cardozo  [CHORUS] They didn't get elected Presidents appointed And for life anointed They didn't get elected But they hear objections And decide elections  William Cushing, Joe Lamar John Jay didn't drive a car Sherman Minton, not Bill Clinton Salmon P. Chase  James Wayne, Tom Todd John M. Harlan twice, that's odd Arthur Goldberg, William Douglas heard the same case  Al Moore, Stan Reed, each heard nervous lawyers plead Bader Ginsburg, John H. Clarke Robert Trimble made no mark  Ward Hunt, Fortas too, Day O'Connor, one day you? Wendell Holmes used moustache combs David Davis was fat  [CHORUS]  George Shiras, Gabe Duval, Kennedy seems kind of tall Frankfurter, Antonin, Blair was judge when court begin  Noah Swayne, Harlan Stone, Hugo Black didn't serve alone Earl Warren, Livingston, take a breath we're almost done  Philip Barbour, James F. Byrnes, when they question take their turns Peter Daniel, John Catron, William Cushing's long been gone  James McReynolds, Morris Waite, Roger Taney not so great Henry Brockholst Livingston, justices are so much fun!  [CHORUS]  Even when they're gone Their decisions all live on, and on, and on...
