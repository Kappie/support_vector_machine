That's the key word: continuously.  Don't know what I mean?  You will.  I voted for the MLS All-Star game yesterday.  This format foreshadows a match between the MLS All-Stars and the most famous soccer club in the world Real Madrid.  The sad part is many Americans know more Real Madrid players (David Beckham, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Luis Figo, Raul, Zinedine Zidane) than MLS All-Stars.  However, Real Madrid scheduled a Japanese tour that will clash with the All-Star game.  What will happen?  Stay tuned to find out.  Anyway, I still voted for the MLS All-Star team and this is who I cast my vote for:  Goalkeepers (2): Henry Ring (CHI), Kevin Hartman (LA)  Both ‘keepers have done outstanding for their team this season.  Who would have thought the Fire had an All-Star sitting on the bench for two years while Zach Thornton dominated the ‘keeper position.  Defenders (5): Jim Curtin (CHI), Kelly Gray (CHI), Frankie Hejduk (CLB), Cory Gibbs (DAL),  Jeff Agoos (SJ)  It was hard only picking five.  I chose Jim Curtin because he is the most underrated player in MLS and has been huge in the Fire’s defensive success so far this season.  I chose Kelly Gray because he is my favourite Fire player, and I chose Frankie Hejduk because he is a great defender, but also gets into the attack very well and has outstanding speed.  Gibbs deserves an All-Star spot because he has been solid all season, and Agoos’s veteranship will be great against a team like Real Madrid.  Midfielders (5): Chris Armas (CHI), DaMarcus Beasley (CHI), Landon Donovan (SJ), Andreas Herzog (LA), Cobi Jones (LA)  This may not be a very good midfield.  True, it is loaded with outstanding players, but it won’t work because there are way too many attacking midfielders.  Donovan, Jones and Herzog are all mainly attacking, Beasley’s main job with the Fire is to support the attack, and Armas can’t stop Real Madrid all on his own.  I would probably put Herzog as the only attacking midfielder because his play this season has been simply outstanding.  His crosses, passes, and vision are second to none.  I cannot stress enough how wonderful Herzog has been this season.  As for Donovan, I hate him, but you cannot deny his wonderful play.  Cobi Jones is getting up there in age so if I have to leave one out, I would leave him out even though he is one of my favourite players.  Forwards (4): Ante Razov (CHI), Brian Ching (SJ), Jovan Kirovski (LA), Carlos Ruiz (LA)  The only one out of these four that will definitely be on the line up is Kirovski.  Ruiz has injury problems, Ching may not get enough votes because he is another one that is underrated, and Razov has been cold most of the season, and anyone not living in Chicago hates him passionately.  Kirovski has been outstanding this year showing why he needs to be considered for the U.S. National Team.  However, four of his five goals have been scored against the Dallas Burn so he may have that going against him.  If Ruiz is healthy, there is no question he will find an All-Star spot.
