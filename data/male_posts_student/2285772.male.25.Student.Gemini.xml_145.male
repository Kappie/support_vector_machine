"i'm listening flowers in the garden laughter in the hall children in the park i will not take these things for granted anymore  to crawl inside the wire and feel something near me to feel this accepting that it is lonely here, but not alone and on the telephone you offer visions dancing  i'm listening music in the bedroom laughter in the hall dive into the ocean singing by the fire running through the forest and standing in the wind in rolling canyons  i will not take these things for granted"  --- urlLink toad the wet sprocket ,  i will not take these things for granted
