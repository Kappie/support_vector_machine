(ha-ha) Blackadder came 2nd in the top British sitcoms thingo, Vicar of Dibley came 3rd. (woooo!) Double PE tomorrow, always fun. (yaaaay) I have tickets to go see Bristol City play on Saturday (woo and yay)  Bad stuff: Citizenship cwk is in tomorrow. And I haven't even started it yet. (SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT) We have yet more bloody exam papers in maffs. (booooooo) I ate too much food inbetween games at badminton. (bleugh)   Holly seems to still be insane. But good at badminton. So she better be doing badminton tomorrow in PE. Or I'll have to beat the holy crap out of Olly and Phil again. (No offense guys) Either way, double PE and the walk home will be kinda crazy and fun, probably with lots of "Hey, thats not fair!"s, "stop smashing it!"s and "pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaassssssssseeeeeeeeee"s. Eehee.  And one great quote from Blackadder 4: Blackadder - "The only attractive woman around here is carved out of stone, called Venus, and is standing in a fountain in the middle of the town square with water coming out of her armpits." George - "So, we're a bit stuck, eh." Blackadder - "You can say that again George. We're in the stickiest situation since Sticky the stick insect got stuck on a sticky bun."
