I'm getting a pizza tonight because of it and I'm going to watch every moment of it!      So, my mom finally decided that she would let me go to sleep away camp for next year. My grandmother convinced her. So I went and got the stuff from Maggie and her mom and we talked for a while. So, then she told all about it and last night my mom sent in the form. Oh, yea, its the one Maggie and her cousins go to. So, now I'm hoping I make it in, which I probably will because I sent it in really early, but they won't open it till October 14 or something. But I hope I get in to Coniston!
