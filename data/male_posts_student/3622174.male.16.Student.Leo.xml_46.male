    
       This weekend I'll be making some adjustments to bagel.tech, including changing the template (possibly, not 100% sure yet), adding new features, and getting rid of the tagboard.  So, please ignore the construction work.  Also, the 1up.com review is being redone, and you will be able to see it on Monday for the Site of the Day.    Enjoy your bagel.tech, and check out Blog of Bagel all weekend for new stuff.
