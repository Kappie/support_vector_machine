Like when My parents said that they were going to there good friend pup's party Knowing that most likely Dad was going to get wasted and they would stay the night Leaving My brother Tanner (Capricorn) alone at Home But instead came home early!? But I did meet this one Dude from Florida, How you ask? I was in this chatroom because i was very,very,very, bored when he typed in "Im 15 male blonde hair blue eyes and i play soccer, and track." I then thought to myself, "Hey I didnt type that" so i made a pit-stop with an IM and that was that? but Dad wouldnt stop calling me out to help wash the truck and suv (Chevy Silverado 2000' and Chevy Suburban 1997') Which that truck is MINE! that is when i get my permit and then license and she is all mine. But ofcourse that is a long time away, besides ill be fine till then and non of the sophmores start driveing except around the end of the year.
