My item I was questing after was unavailable. I met by friends sister who works there. Other than that no revelations occured. However I hate the transit system for West Vancouver...because it sucks my ass. I waited for 40 minutes, which is actually short from past experiences, for a bus way behind schedule. Oooh and I had sushi for dinner. BC rolls rock. If they played guitar they would bust out some Page inspired solos. Mmmm BC rolls. So there's my insane diary. -Hip-happening Gavin I could have lied I'm such a fool.
