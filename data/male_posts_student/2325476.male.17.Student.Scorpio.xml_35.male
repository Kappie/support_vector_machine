Then i did laundry all day cause everyone who was like, "oh yah, we'll be there saturday afternoon," never showed up. But I guess thats cool because then a friend that was supposed to call me about seeing a movie never did, and I just happened to not at all be able to get in touch with her. But just so long as no one else was inconvenienced and everyone else was happy then I guess it's fine and fucking dandy.  At least someone thinks enough of me to chill with me for an hour.
