I finally got the AP Euro project done with Matt and the rest of my group. Oh this is Saturday night but because its after 12, it's considered Sunday. It's also Day Light Savings Time. Yea...so Friday (yesterday) I hung out with Justin and Matt and slept over Matt's. Then the next day Jay came to Matt's and we spent a good time going down his steps on bean bags. Damn what fun, but it hurt. Tom (Matt's brother) had gone down and hit his head against the railing and then the ground and then when he was on the ground in pain and Callie (their dog) comes over and starts humping him. I hadn't laughed that hard in a while. I laughed so hard I almost fainted literally, I started fading out but then I caught my breath. Funny because I told Matt I'd stop laughing forever because I'd gain weight if I did. Laughing makes you lose weight? Oh yea, earlier in the day Matt's brother, PJ, and I threw the bean bags over ourselves and Callie humped us. It was good fun at the Kaiser's. I went home, took a shower, drummed for a good amount of time and was amazed at some of the things I was doing, then went to see HellBoy with Jay, Jared and Matt. Horrible. Just horrible. But it was fun. Right now I'm close to fainting, so tired. Tomorrow, well today, I think the band is gonna do some hard practicing to prepare for the recording we supposedly doing this vacation. Well, it's time for my departure. Many combulations Elizegurth.
