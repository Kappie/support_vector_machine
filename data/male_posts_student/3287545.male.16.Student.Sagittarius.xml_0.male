I wish she wouldn’t. I’ve been going and staying on the internet recently about the time she calls so she can’t get though but it seems she’s going to try constantly so I have no choice but to listen to her ramble on about a load of crap. We were, well she was talking for about an hour, more than that even. So I missed relocation relocation and a bit of grand designs, programs I watch every week. She’s really pissing me off now. I’m rtrapped in a relationship which I don’t want to be in. I don’t want to get any further in but I can’t get out because she apparently really really likes me. So Laura was telling me earlier. In science today all the girls bar Laura were out because of the German exchange people, so it was just me Lloyd and Laura on the table. I wish Lloyd was ill that day or something, because there was a good bond going on with us and I felt I could tell her how I feel about Katie but Lloyd kept interrupting and getting in the way. He’s pissing me off to. I feel like I have no choice but to hang around with him all the time when I would prefer to be with my kinda ‘new’ friends. At least they actually listen to me and ask me if I’m ok. Lloyd does nothing like that, he just calls out stupid comments which make me look bad for sitting anywhere near him, and talks to me about stuff I’m not really interested in. Anyway, back in science with Laura, she asked me if I was gay, can’t remember why it came up, oh yeah, cause I wanted the pink set of work cards, anyway, I desperately wanted to say yes, but I had to say no, especially as Lloyd was sitting right next to me. If he hadn’t been there I would probably have said something like, I can’t tell you that, and that would make her think I am, but it would be unconfirmed. I think she would be cool with it but I don’t know if I could trust her not to tell anyone else. I really wish I had a girl best friend type thing going on with someone like Laura or Amy, who I could share these thoughts with, but I’ll be using this for the time being. So after I said No, to Laura’s question, Lloyd chipped in by saying he trough I was Bi, and I don’t think he was joking. I think he refuses to believe I could be gay, but at the same time my campness makes him think I am, and in Lloyd world someone who seems gay but isn’t must therefore be in between, bi, which is bollocks, but Lloyd doesn’t really get the real world. He knows what all the words mean, gay bi straight but his knowledge on these topics isn’t cultured enough. He seems quite homophobic, and he seems obsessed and perhaps disgusted by the thought that there are openly bi girls in out year. Lloyd lives in a world where words are more important than definitions.
