I feel so tired today.. walked alot.. kick alot.. punch a lot..haha..  Actually today i was late for my class at Botanical Gardens.. i arrive there like around 8:20am.. and i realized that noone was in class.. they had actually left for an educational walk with the lecturer.. so i caught up with them.. and continue the rest of the journey..  After class.. i took a walk.. haha.. not exactly.. i went around walking to and fro around BG.. taking pictures from my project.. i was suppose to take pictures of plants that was in my plant list given by my lecturer... I got around 10-15 of the plants.. and the total is 30 plants to be exact..  I was there walking around from 5-7++... very the tiring..  Right after that ... left to Bugis.. to surprise my darl..  then back home...  i didn't stop there..haha.. i actually kickboxed for awhile.. haha.. it's been sum time since i kicked and punched my punching bag... so i was like sweating here and there... hahah... i also tried err... kicking err.. the metal pole of my double-storey bed.. hehehe.. and my right leg shin.. was a little swollen.. but .. hey.. no pain no gain rite? hahah (consoling myself)...  tomorrow start at 8! so adiosa.. semua!
