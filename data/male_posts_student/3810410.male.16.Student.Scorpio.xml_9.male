I hope that you are lonesome too, cause I am  I want back that hat that I always wore And that jean jacket that seems to be torn  It’s almost as if you tore out my heart I throw out my notebook that I’ve had since 8th grade It’s filled with our notes, yeah it was great But this masquerade is a never-ending process And you think that you’re fooling everyone, but you aren’t fooling me  Keep your door closed, and keep all my clothes I don’t want them back- Your scent still lingers on them And that aroma you left still surrounds my bed Like a pheromone ghost, it still haunts my head I can’t stand it any longer It’s a never-ending road, that only seems to get farther And I have lost touch with love  You know, what they say has finally come true I never knew what I had until I lost you You were my jewel, gave me such pleasure One man’s trash is another man’s treasure And I treasured you that best I could Even if you never understood all my intentions that I held close To my heart, but I fear the most, it happened everyday And that aroma you left still surrounds my bed Like a pheromone ghost, it still haunts my head I can’t stand it any longer It’s a never-ending road, that only seems to get farther And I have lost touch with love Can you bring me back to love?
