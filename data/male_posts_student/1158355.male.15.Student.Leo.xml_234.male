English was hilarious, Global Regents was a joke, Bio Regents was easy, took that today. All I got left is my Italian Regents. Bad news. Yesterday I got my braces on and I look like a fool. I've already had bottom braces a while back but now I have them on top and bottom and it kills and my lips and gums are all cut up. I also have to eat rice pudding for the next day or two. After I got my braces on, I hung out with Paul, Matt, Ricky, Crystal, Nicole L, Alyssa something and Ray H. I also got this Jew Camp thing in the mail and on the cover was a few jews I know water rafting...Jake, Jeff and Shawn. I showed it to everyone, especially Paul, loved it. I also had a great introduction for Matt as I dressed as Neo and stood in the middle of the raining foggy road to re-enact the Revolutions SUPER BURLY BRAWL. It was fun. Then I wrestled Matt with him wearing a South Park (Stan) mask and Michelle Downing drives by and gives us the finger, *shivers*...creepy. Girls and ray went home. I was depressed because the girls made Crystal come with them and she was gonna play Twister and I was all ready for a really fun game. Then we went to my house for a bit. Then it was just Heaton and I, and we watched parts of Signs but then his brother came so I watched T3 with my parents and then Paul came to study for BIO with me. I have never laughed this hard in my life. I was tearing like crazy. Paul and I have never laughed this hard. Paul told me about how Anthony Calandrino was chosen to answer a multiple choice in Mrs. Laird's Bio class. Anthony goes, "The answer is B...Sausage." Part of why it was so funny was the way Paul said it and the time it was at night. Ok, so after laughter to the heavens, Paul went home. Today after the Bio Regents, I hung out with James and Paul and jammed with them for a bit. Then went to Boyz Day with Matt and Jon, it was ok...I think we missed the good part of it all but last year definetly was better. Kao drove us around, it was awesome. Jon, Matt and I also went into town for some ices. When Jon went home, Matt and I went to James' where I recorded with Paul New Found Glory - All Downhill From Here. No singing because it was late at night at James' voice was raspy. Then I left, oh and I forgot to mention it was raining pianos and bricks at like 7, it was awesome. It reminded me of the time when Pat, Dan, Jimmy and I went outside when it was the hardest rain down pour ever and we ran to Eric's. Oh, another god damn beheading in Iraq. I'm so sick of those fucking assholes. I was thinking about writing a book about a soldier who loses his mind in war, kills a bunch of boys and girls and just kills his way through a innocent town of Iraqis. Then he finally reaches the real Al-Qaeda and tears em apart. That would sell like crazy, but if I made it, someone might report it to the school or cops or something and knowing this gay ass soft country, certain people will think I need to seek guidance. Well fuck that. That's not the reason I'm not writing it though. Personally, I'm not afraid to say Hail Hitler and say I'm gonna blow up the school because it's only words, and I'd hope the school saw it just so it scares those bastards. The reason I'm not writing the book is because I'm too fucking lazy. But why am I talking about blowing up the school, the school is a god compared to Iraq. Let's nuke em! Just think about the man who was beheaded had a wife and kids. Just imagine if that happened to your dad. Oh man, OOOOOH FUCKING MAN. I'd work out to be the strongest man in the world. Fight my way through a huge American arsenal building. Load up on weapons and get a small nuke and get my ass to Iraq and kill as many people as I could. The kids, the women, the men. Kill every one of them. Then Boom! Set off the nuke. But that's if my dad was beheaded and the only person I know that has a chance of getting capture and beheaded is my cousin who might be going to Iraq (Marine). NO, no way in hell he can get captured, what are the chances? Oh fuck this. Why am I talking about war again? I thought I was through with this shit. Ah, one more easy Regents on Tuesday, then summer is a callin! THIS SUMMER IS GONNA KICK SO MUCH ASS!  "All that we can do is just survive All that we can do to help ourselves is stay alive  Ragged lines of ragged grey Skeletons, they shuffle away Shouting guards and smoking guns Will cut down the unlucky ones  I clutch the wire fence until my fingers bleed A wound that will not heal A heart that cannot feel Hoping that the horror will recede Hoping that tomorrow we'll all be freed  Sickness to insanity Prayer to profanity Days and weeks and months go by Don't feel the hunger  Too weak to cry  I hear the sound of gunfire at the prison gate Are the liberators here? Do I hope or do I fear? For my father and my brother, it's too late But I must help my mother stand up straight  Are we the last ones left alive? Are we the only human beings to survive?" - Rush
