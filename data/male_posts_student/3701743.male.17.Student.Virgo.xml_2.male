Today I got out of bed late and got my daily espresso (read:caffeine-shot) at the italian ice-cream shop where I work with Dale.  After that I went back home and turned on the computer so here I am. I decided to not read all the 900 pages again but practice on my economics by reading some old exams I found on the internet. Wish me luck! The pics are taken on the terrace from the  urlLink karseboom  where I spent a lot of my time.  I wish I would be here now!  urlLink    Ale   urlLink    Ale and cards   urlLink    Some more ale .  urlLink    Dale and me   urlLink    View from the terrace and a little piece of Tim
