The ppl there says she is still as bitchy as before and had not changed much since the Nationals. Damn, she could have been dead in 3 wks. She could have been knocked down by a car and die on the way to hospital. Still, I can't believe she could survive.  Got the DVD player today and watched Spiderman 2. I can't wait to see the other movies. After the series of tests this wk, it was finally time to relax a little bit before going on to Fri the thirteenth next wk for the Lit test. Then it is on to the Science and Maths common tests 3 days later after black Friday. That will be the time when all the tests are finally over. Huge relief then. I can't wait until then.  Well, I have not much to say abt the Hate Zhang Campaign. I may not implement it of Zhang treats me nicer. Then again, it is impossible. Nevertheless, Zhang will be my greatest enemy. Slaughtering Zhang, slaughtering Zhang is my pride!
