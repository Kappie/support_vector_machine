Anytime something was going on in my life I could go to the EMS office and 90% of the time you'd be up there working your ass off on some project that was due in 12 hours or something. No matter what you had going on as soon as I walked in the door you always made time for me and we'd have a good time just talking...about anything, it didn't matter. I would sit down in those shitty chairs and you'd let me bitch, bitch, bitch about my life. You also let me in on your life and it was therapeutic like that. Why aren't there people like you in my medical school class? I really wish there was, but no, there can only be one Jake Woods.  So I'm a week into classes now. Yep, we got practically no summer. I did get to go to Vegas for 5 days with some friends though. That was in mid July. Man did I drink. I actually got really smashed the night before school started. Can you imagine me coming into the first day of class with a heinous hangover? Who would have figured? Well I did it and it sucked. That night was fun as hell, but that monday sucked butt. You know one of the biggest reasons why it sucked butt? I discovered that morning that I broke one of my favorite shot glasses. I completely shattered it. I also apparently cut myself accidentally with it in several different places. Seriously, I woke up looking like I got the shit beat out of me but I don't remember a thing. That's very scary sounding, but don't worry, everything's fine now.  Jake, I've got a question for you...more like a series of statements. I'm starting to get concerned about my mental health. Med school is really fucking with my mind. I'm probably just blowing things out of proportion, but I don't know. I've no basis for comparison. I know about bipolar disorder and I don't think I'm bipolar just because I don't think my behavior changes eratically, but I do go through these periods of hi-low-hi-low and when I'm low it's like I have a really hard time getting things done. This is probably just normal, but it still sucks. I probably just really need to get laid. It's so frustrating sometimes.   Tonight, just before I was leaving for the party I went by friend's apartment to get him so that we could carpool. He tells me at the last minute that he's not going. It's a small thing, no big deal, right? I know that in one part of my brain, but the part I listen to is telling me that I'm not being studious enough and that I should not be going out to a party. I become angry thinking that he's on this bandwagon of new habits and that going to a party with me is a bad habit. Of course these things probably aren't true. Later I find out that he's trying to avoid someone else...so I had been preoccupied with anger and confusion all night for no reason really.  I don't know jack about life. Sometimes I think I pick up on clues and signals here and there, but I'm really just floating around from one interesting flicker to the next. Does being engaged alleviate some of this craziness? I've got to go now in order to put a stop to my rambling. As I look back on this email it's so crazy and disordered. I really should delete it and start over again, but no, I'm not going to. It is fuckin' the way it is, right or not-so-right.   Here's to your Saturday night and write back anytime. I love email a little too much.  DS
