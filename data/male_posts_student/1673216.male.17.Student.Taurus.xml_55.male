You all may want to talk about how your day went, and what's irking you about your best friend's behavior (completly random example, I have no idea if anyone wrote about this), but I'd rather see what's on people's minds at a deeper level, and give them the same opportunity should they choose to like the same thing. It would be sad, and even tragic, if someone read this, and immediatly got the impression that they didn't like me. Unfair, it's your choice to read this or not...You've made it this far, why not delve deeper into the broken shards of my brain?
