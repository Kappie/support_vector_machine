My sleeping habits have gotten worse, I'm falling asleep at about 3 or 4 in the morning.  School feels so long, and after dealing with those annoying projects, it just gets longer by having to take notes in just about every class.  To compound that, I do work during lunch, and that prevents me from eating lunch.  Other than that, I'm great.
