"Ok, just looking out for my fellow human being, sorry for creeping you out if I did, g'night." "It's ok, I actually don't have any ride home, thus my pacing around the parking lot." "Er...Were you planning on sleeping here...?" "I dunno, I was gonna cross that bridge when I got there." "Haha, clever...Can I help you out anyway?" "Well...I'm not one to mooch..." "It's ok, you could always give me a dollar for gas.." "I don't have any money.." "Well then, I shall do it anyway...where to?" Slipping the swinging key into the lock, unlatching the door, and clicking open the handle, I drive home alone, by myself, and with no one. Not exactly eager to forge the next pseudo-conversation.  A black audi races by me, misses my car by about 6 inches, and blows past the stopsign. Teenager, without a care in the world. You only live once, right? Besides, his life was more important then mine, and obviously worth riskining both our lives to get to his destination five minutes earlier. But the million-dollar question is: Does he deserve my respect?  How do you draw the line?  A motley car roves down the street in the opposite direction of mine. Windows open, radio on, one headlight slicing through the night. Male, about 20, on his way home from his friend's house. He hates the fact that he has a bedtime just because "he's under his paret's roof for the time being." Doesn't matter, that's not what is on his mind. He's blissfully lost in his music, because his favortite band is on the radio (he has no cd player, so hearing music he likes is rare) playing one of his favorite songs. It doesn't matter which one. Know why? Because I don't know him, and he's already over 6 blocks behind me.  Incomplete thoughts..Incomplete conversations..Fake meetings..We've got questions,  no one  has answers.
