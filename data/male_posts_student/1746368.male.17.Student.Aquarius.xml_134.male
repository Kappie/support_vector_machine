I can't really complain but I'm just going to be under a lot of stress real soon with crunchtime for school and all and I am just trying to get away from it all, but what I am ending up doing is creating more stress. I wish I could change all of this with a blink of an eye. Too bad.  "[Hanging on to Slim's leg in mid-air]  Flick: You've got to help me, I'm desperate.
