I felt so helpless and had my paper scribbled with all my nonsense. Well, I could only do a few of them while the others really sucks !! Oh my god !! Its the most fearful subject I gonna take tommorrow, its Chinese !! It is always the lowest mark that I score among all. I neglect my Chinese since I was young. But never mind, I think it would not beat me down because I believe I can pass it. Yesterday was Jay's album first day of release but I still haven't collect my CD yet. *Sigh* Anli told me it was nice and I couldn't stand the temptations. I heard it before on the radio and MY GOD !! It was extremely nice to be able to smooth my ears. You will like it when you hear it the first time.
