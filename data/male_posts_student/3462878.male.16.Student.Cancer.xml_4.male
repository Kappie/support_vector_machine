I know I probably shouldn't be sharing my feelings with everyone on the wide internet.    I shall off this brand new shiny Blog by saying   FUCKING GCSE's!!   I really can't be doing with much more of this crap. I know, I've done two so far, and am probably just over-reacting, but I really don't like tests. I'm not a person who can sit down for hours on end, revising. I have to be doing something, and that something usually involves playing some form of game (Sim City is a new favourite :D) but then I get too wound up in the game, and forget all about revising, so it's safer just not to start revising in the first place  Probably a bit long, but my feelings are gunna be like that, people don't talk to me, and generally I keep my feelings inside (I dunno why, that's just me)  Till the next time I remember about this
