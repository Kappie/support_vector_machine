I woke up at 6. Yes!!! 6!!! I got up at 5:45ish to get a drink and couldnt sleep after that. I then proceeded downstairs and did my usual morning thing. I then played some more of the WC3 campaign. Afterwards I took a shower and got dressed to go to the pickering flea market.  The flea market was exactly how I imagined. A huge open place wit hundreds of lil booths. I hadn't gone there before so I was kinda excited. I had $200 in my pocket and I was ready to spend all of it! Well I started off the day very shy, afraid to ask any questions. But as I went from clothing booth to booth I got more into things. Asking the price of this and what they have in that size. Well, to keep a long story short, I left wit a pair of lite blue jean shorts, some dark blue RocaWear jeans, and a black and white "name brand" tee. I use the quotations cuz they have a name on the front but expert analysists (my friends) tell me that the tees are bootleg... hahaha, o well, i got some great prices. Usually a nice pair of jeans are at least $80. I payed $60 for the jeans and a white tee. And the shorts look very boot, but for $25 how can u go wrong? I payed approx. $25 in tees, nice ones wit decent designs. Reg tees that size usually go for 2 for $30. Did I get a good deal?.... I like to think so.   Afterwards my friend came over and we ran some INTENSE MvC2. He usually owns me but I had the xbox advantage. To keep this short we played for like 4+ hrs and at the end I was prolly up 8 games or so. If we did this at the arcade we woulda spent at least $10 on quarters. He's used to the dreamcast controllers while I love the xbox. The only diff besides the size and shape is that xbox has 2 xtra buttons that serve as PP and KK. This is key for dashing in linxing out supers. He didnt take advatange of this and strained to get supers sometimes while I cant play w/o it and abused it to my heart's content. But anywhere besides xbox means me getting fooded. After he got strained in WC3 we finally reached the courts.   When we got there, some guys were getting ready to play hockey where the net wit the mesh is so we played on another one. We ran a rematch of around the world and he took 1 and I took 2. Then I shot around and watched another game going on as my friend talked to a girl (I'm sure) on the phone. After, that we ran 1v1. The first game was on the same net we started on. He won and then we moved to the mesh net. Then he beat me 2 more times before we called it a day.   After a short chat I took a shower and here I am... my fam ate out again w/o me and I'm hungry...  On a side note, my posts lately seem to have been bothering my only fan left, so lemme explain a few things. Here's the main thing:  "I knew that if I ever "loved" someone who "loved" me back then I wouldn't hesitate to commit..."  No, she didn't confess love...  "I promised my heart to the first person who seemed like they  might  take it."  Might is the keyword, she seemed like she might... that means 0.01% chance... which is more than I ever had.  Anyways, see ya later... all 1 of you who MIGHT read this...  Warren   [10/7/11]
