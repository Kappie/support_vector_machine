I'm not saying I don't care how I look, I like looking nice.  I love it.  I like getting compliments and stuff, that's all well and good.  Here goes:  School... all of it.  Scott not a popular guy.  People who mostly make fun of him and put him down... the trendy people... the "cool" people.  Scott didn't want to become like "them".  And change can be a scary thing.  I'm a fan of change to a degree... I find it exciting a lot of times, but people just have to understand that changing how I look after I've basically looked the same for 25 years.. is a big deal to me.  I know to some people it's not a big deal.  It kind of makes me feel self-conscious to think that people think I need to change.  Whether it's a good thing or a bad thing.  So please don't think that the previous blog was some maddening rant... it was not.  Oh, and about the "forget girls" part... I'd like to take that back.  I want peace in my heart and in my mind, AND girls.
