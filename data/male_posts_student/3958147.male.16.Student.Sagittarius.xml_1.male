The only man who ever got his work done by Friday was Robinson Crusoe!         Teacher: What is 24 times 8?   Pupil: 192.   Teacher: That's very good.   Pupil: Whaddya mean very good? It's absolutely perfect.       In my hand I hold a ball             White and dimpled, rather small Oh, how harmless it does appear             This innocent looking little sphere By its size I could not guess             The awesome power it does posess But since I fell beneath its spell             I’ve been through the fires of hell. My life hasn’t been quite the same             Since I chose to play its game. It rules my mind for hours on end             A fortune it has had me spend It has made me curse and cry             And hate myself and want to die It promises me a thing called “par”             If I can hit it straight and far To master such a tiny ball             Should not be very hard at all But my desires the ball refuses             And does exactly as it chooses. It hooks and slices, dribbles and dies             Or disappears before my eyes. Often it will have a whim             To hit a tree or take a swim With miles of grass on which to land             It finds that tiny patch of sand Then has me offering up my soul             If it would first drop in the hole It’s made me whimper like a pup             And swear that I would give up And take to drink to ease my sorrow             But the ball knows I’ll be back tommorow.
