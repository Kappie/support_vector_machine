I had some good moments, a few good hits and passes here or there, but mostly it was crap...chad though was playin like he had never stepped on a court before, i give credit to him for comin and tryin to do the best he can but he jus needs to learn all the little things before he can play wit us...like reading where the ball is goin, stop jumping while he's passing, lead his passing with his shoulders not arms, have a faster reaction time, i can go on and on...i mean practicing non-stop is what i do, and i basically learn something new everyday...but yeah, he has a lot to learn. But hopefully he doesnt stress over it, i had to go through that when i was his age, but w/e...he'll b fine. Well hopefully next week i will continue wit my recruitment video for hawaii and other colleges...but mainly hawaii. Hopefully God is with me through out the week and bless me to play the best i can...hehe. Well i guess all i have to do is get out of this funk i've been having lately...i'm probly jus stressin out too much and gettin pissed easily...idk...i'll get over it. So the only  "problem"  that i am concerned about it is vball...payce.
