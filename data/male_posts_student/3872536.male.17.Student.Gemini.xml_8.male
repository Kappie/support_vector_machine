Rather convinced with the final product lor. Haha.  After which we learn the committee item 4 the concert. Leonard and some other members actually managed to get the so called dance done within today lor. Hidden talents in the committee ba...  Rather frustrated with Esmond today lor. Last minute then tell mi cant get the projector 4 the concert. Then how on earth are we going to show the animation to the guests lol. He wanted mi to like to the animation but it's like no projector, then do 4 wat lol. He suggested that I go home and do the animation b4 the concert at nite while they are having the camp in school lor. As if I can complete within such a short time lor. Sian... Then he expect mi to go home and then return back to TJ again at nite mehz... Sian lah dun noe wat he's thinking about lol. Juz hate last minute changes.  Initially I wanted to have pw meeting tml de, to do the survey, coz tot thr'll be no meeting tat day lor. But haiz... Got the camp meeting again lor. I realli dun mind going 4 meetings, but can't they like prepare everything in advanced first so that we will not be like slacking thr, duno wat to do... It's realli a waste of time man. Juz take 4 eg lah, some of us were like doing the door gifts and we like took quite a long time. Can't the rest like think of some ideas for the event rather than juz toking and resting lor. Sian...  The camp is like on friday and we have yet to borrow the projector lol...  Then we suggested on burning the animation to be prepared to be burned into a CD for the guests, but last minute, no cd burner, then the gift how lehz....  Juz hope that Esmond managed to borrow an external cd burner and a projector ba, if not the animation and gift will be like screwed up lol...
