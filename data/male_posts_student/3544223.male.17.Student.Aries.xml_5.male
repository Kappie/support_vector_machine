Today couldn't make it cause i am just too tired to study thus i same home early.Haiz... My feeling for her slowly drift apart as weeks and months passes. It seem i have my own target in life to achieve. Now in this world nobody understands me best, none at all. Sad to say this but i have some outside friend who treat me very good. I know them through a game and even though they like to tease me a lot but they treat me very well. Better than some people i know in school. I had a few outing with them and they brought me to a lot of places and i learn quite a number of new games like pool, which i learnt in within a day. Steve was one of them i chat with most of the time online other than yiwen and a few others. Even though he is older than me by a year but he treat me more than just friend, a brother to me.     Life is full of obstacles, either you try to pass it or you will be stuck there. I remember i created a poem about life is an obstacles but it was long lost a few years back. Today actually want to go down to Pasir Ris Beach to write my last will on the rock that she wrote about me but i changed my mind and didn't go. Yesterday 13/7/2204 Tuesday. I saw her walking home alone, actually wanted to call her but i changed my mind and accompany my friend to go and study together.*sigh* i feel very bad. i don't know i don't know. Everytime i see her i don't know weather to avoid her or should i just face it. My heart in a confused state.
