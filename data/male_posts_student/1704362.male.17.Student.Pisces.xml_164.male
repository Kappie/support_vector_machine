SAM:  Have you and President Bush decided on what to rename the Tour de France? The Tour de Freedom, perhaps?   CHENEY: (Talking out of the side of his mouth) The Tour de France?  Well, the racers should come to my home state of Wyoming and try riding on them mountains, those are REAL mountains...not those pussy mountains out in France and Belgium.   ROVE:  I also have some good news, and I have some bad news.  The good news is, Lance Armstrong's second testicle does not pose a threat to the nation's security.  We have neutralized it and hidden it within our borders at a secure location.  The bad news is Dick Cheney refuses to share a shadow office with some "prissy bike-queen's testy."   -  urlLink Operation Infinite Justice
