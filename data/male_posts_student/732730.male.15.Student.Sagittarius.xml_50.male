It should be pretty painless, but let's wait and see :P  It was the sports carnival today. I sat around and did not much at all, and I still got sunburnt. How shocking. I went in no events, so there was no chance of me embarrasing myself by tripping or coming last or what ever.  Oh, and thats for ditching me this arvo, Tara. You  didn't  need to wait for Emma. Ah well, no big deal. Didn't wanna talk to you anyway...
