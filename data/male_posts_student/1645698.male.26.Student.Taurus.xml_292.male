Today was wonderful..in the sense that I have taken moldings of my teeth(not to say that the process itself was of a pleasing matter)..but this is proof...and considering my orthodontist even said so...that come Feb 25th..i am TAKING MY BRACES OFF!!...and getting a retainer..and apparently some sort of thing called a mouth guard which will help in the alignment of my jaw i suppose.........oooo oooooo how i've waited for sooo long. ~_~  o...how i will sing sing sing
