Marten is doing something, but not something that I can put my finger on, or see or smell or touch. Erin's doing that bizarre disco play. I don't know where Sophia is. I'm so very lonely...  Jonah: Bring my pants (and  all  of the change in my pockets) in a big bag to The Pajama Game. Otherwise they'll be lost in Jonah's room, among college brochures and clothes forever. And I liked those pants too!  Why shake hands when we can touch...other things? Like Lips...
