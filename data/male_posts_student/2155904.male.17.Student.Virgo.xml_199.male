And now Tyke just has to blog/talk to people online who are either online and talking to Tyke or sorta online but not talking to Tyke.  It makes sense if you are Tyke so just go along with it.  But here's how today went.  Tyke got up and worked on his grad project portfolio first off.  He did the letter pretty quickly and then started to compile things so he figured it would be quick.  But he also knew that his printer was on the fritz so it might not be so smooth.  Well then things got said and Tyke decided to go help out Kinker and Tyronious with some prom stuff and maybe help Tyke out while doing so.  Well Tyke didn't get any help out of it but it was fun.  They went to Party 4 Less and got 4 dozen balloons for Tyronious with a dozen of the blown up ones in Tyke's car so he couldn't see out the back.  Then they went to Kinko's where Tyke was going to print some of his stuff off but he couldn't do it for free he didn't think so he just decided to not do it.  Then he went back and they watched some of Tyke's prom video that he made the night before.  After that they went to Ted Meyer's for some stuff and then to Costco to pick up a pizza.  They ordered it on the phone while standing in line so as to get it quicker.  Then they went up to Tyke's house to eat it while they waited for Trewfanator to leave her house so Tyronious could go fill the room with all the balloons and rose petals and such.  They finally did that and it was fun and tiring but then as they were leaving Trewf returned without their realization cuz Tyronious missed the text message he received.  So they sorta hid but couldn't really and it was just really awkward.  And then they stayed there for longer than Tyke would have liked cuz he still had to do his portfolio.  So finally they left but then they came to Tyke's and watched the prom video Tyke made last night for Purdy.  It is really pretty tight.  Well Tyke then called Purdy to try to see if he could set her up at night with the video and she was able to come pick him up.  So they went to Refuge together and Ekul was there and he performed a couple of songs and they were hilarious!!  He did a great job.  And 2 of the bands were really good too.  So after Refuge, Purdy drove Tyke back to his house and then he invited her in for a little bit to watch "this video" and she said she would.  So Tyke got it all ready for her and Tyke's portfolio mess was everywhere so it looked like just a normal day but then he showed the video.  And she really seemed to enjoy it.  It made Tyke really feel great to hear her laugh and watch it so he definitely feels like it was a success.  So Tyke owes his sincerest gratitude to Skippy for doing an awesome job directing, Kinker for his ideas and sound mastery, and Macaroon for well...he didn't do anything but he was there.  So now the secret is finally out.  Tyke asked Purdy and he even used his blog somewhat secretively to ask her but he didn't tell her that.  And since she said she didn't know he was going to ask her he knows it is true.  The last word (or two in the first case) of 7 of the last 8 or 9 blogs spells out Will you go to prom with me Purdy.  Tyke just felt like doing it and he knew if he didn't draw attention to it, it wouldn't be that noticeable.  So yeah, go back and look at that.  Well after Tyke walked her out, he went back to working on the portfolio.  Tyke's dad was finally able to fix the printer so Tyke was able to print everything off and hole punch it so now he just needs to put it together tomorrow morning and that won't be that hard.  So now Tyke is really excited to go to prom with Purdy but he still has to go through the rest of the planning and that is becoming a chore.  But now, Tyke can be excited that he has asked Purdy.  And that is all Tyke needs to be excited about for now.  But now Tyke really thinks he should go to bed.  He most likely has missed out on a lot of details but forgive him, for his head has been working hard today.  Oh jeez...Tyke just got called and more weird stuff has happened...wow
