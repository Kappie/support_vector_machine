What we don't see are alot more cruel that it can be beyond imagination. Being aware that you are ignorant is a great step to knowledge. Hoping that someday one able to go around the world to gain more wisdom rather than remaining somewhere that all are provided. Feeling the hardships n pains of others by experience it is beautiful. Being sophisticated is gorgeous. Should one be content n satisfy with what they are now? If they are, they should be abashed..
