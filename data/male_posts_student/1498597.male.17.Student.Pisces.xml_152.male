Well, thanks to readers like  Eddie , who have dutifully informed me to fuckin' update the blog, I will do so now in a very fashionable manner.  I'm sure a lot a lot a lot (yeah, I repeated the word "a lot" on purpose  Nick ) have heard people or even heard yerself use the phrase "Life is like a rollercoaster, it has its ups and downs."  Damn right its like a rollercoaster.  Now, lets see...there are different kinds of blogs that will appear on the  Punk Rock Editorial , such as the conspiracy blog, the victory blog, the information blog...all of them are written for different purposes.  Well this is a fuckin' angry blog, or in other words, you have the fuckin' privelage to listen to me go postal and whatnot.  Well, things aren't so bad right now...or at least they're an improvement from what they were yesterday.   My old man  is seriously being' a motherfucker right now, and it just pisses me the fuck off.  God damn dude, he quit his fuckin' job today!  And he always fuckin' does that!  Alright, everyone is entitled to a good bitch, which is one of the reasons I started this damn blog...to fuckin' bitch and rant and rave and bitch...I guess its sorta like a kinda personal journal or somethin'.  It really helps to get yer feelings out there.  Anyway, I think thats enough for now...this blog prolly accomplished nothin'...or maybe its an allusion to the next blog topic?  More to come...!
