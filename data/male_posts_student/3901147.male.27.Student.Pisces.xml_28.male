They have the exact same things every year in the exact same places.  It would be fun to take children to; but that is about it.  Something about walking around with bugs, strange people in wife beaters will beer bellies and the smell of livestock  all mixed into temperatures of about 95 degrees and no breeze!!!!  Things good about the fair though:  -  Philly Cheesesteak Sanwich *this thing was good even though we aren't in Philly  -  It makes my wife happy so I grin an bear it  Bad things about the fair:  -  Lots of large, smelly wierd people with no manners  -  Farm animals all around with farm poo and yummy farm smells  -  5 bucks for the Philly sandwich!!  No drink no extras!  -  Carnies... yes there are carnies  -  Crafts made by the public that should truly be kept to country stores that no one ever visits  Oh my there is a lot more to the list but I could dedicate an entire blog to fair idiosyncricies.  LOL!!  I walked by this one game and this guy says to me... Come throw the ball and win your woman a prize.  When I ignored him he continued to tell me how I wasn't man enough.  I turned and said in front of our group out to the man,  " It's ok I'm hung like Mr. Ed she will forgive me."
