I was a little busy; in other words I was being lazy enjoying my summer. :D I didn’t screw up my solo at the parade, and I think we may have got 1st place but I won’t find out until tomorrow. I got to sit with Ryan on the bus to the parade, I really wanted to confess my love to him, but I am to much of a goddamn wuss. I love him so much I would die if I could be with him in the afterlife. I found another pic that I like of Shinji and Kaworu; I will post it later. I started writing a fanfiction the other night but when I was done writing my browser crashed and I lost everything. I really didn’t feel like typing it again so maybe I will get to it later. This Saturday I have to go to graduation and play, then I have to go to a graduation party. It going to suck, but luckily the day before I get to go to a county fair. That will be somewhat enjoyable. But I have to go with my 3 cousins, which really blows. Other than that not much is going on. TTYL
