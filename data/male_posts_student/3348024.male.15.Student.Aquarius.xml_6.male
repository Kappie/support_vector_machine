I traveled to Michigan City today and stopped at a Pizza Hut Express/Taco Bell where I ordered a number 2 w/ cheese and cinnamon sticks.(Mexican Pizza)  It ended up being something like $5 but that's irrelevant.  The thing is when I went back up the get more cinnamon sticks.  The total was 94 cents.  The problem was the cashier of an undisclosed ethnic background told me it was 94 cent.  I heard what she said but I, being the jackass that I am, asked her what she said.  she said, "That'll be 94 cent."  I asked again, "What did you say?"  She replied, "94 cent," Realizing it was a lost cause, I just gave the cashier of an undisclosed ethnic background a dolla dolla bill.  she then said, "6 cent will be your change."  Oh man, I was about to jump up on the counter, pull my pants down, and declare my independence.  Luckily for the world I did not.
