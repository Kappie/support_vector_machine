It didn't seem like Crystal and Yumi were really into it. Oh well... it was cool nonetheless. I dug the manuscripts. I just wished I could read Latin. On the way back I made a few calls to people I knew on the way, because I didn't want to drive all the way back to Irvine in that traffic. I ended up stopping in Torrance and visiting Janet. We had Chipotle's which I think is over priced and not all that great.  I then stopped by Chain Reaction for some MTX and Audio Karate tickets.  Now here I am at home.  ***
