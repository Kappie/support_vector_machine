Anyway, today, we had a full dress rehersal! haha... ok, so perhaps, the whole thing, wasn't really great, but at least, there were no major screwups and Sujuan and i actually managed to hang on and simply worked together! haha... Shared lots of jokes and and had quite a lot of fun... haha, i think the best and most entertaining part was that of the performance 'sleeping!' put up by feelow ACSIAN Jonathon Khoo! haha... it was damn funny lah, the way he simply fell asleep! haha... but oh well, Sujuan and i videotaped it and well... haha... had a good laugh along with Kelly, Jiade and Gary! haha... so funny! *snigger*  Ok, so now, back to the many topic; Here i am, drained, both physically and mentally. Physically, simply cause we spent so much time working on the pieces and tired from waiting at times, and oh... for having fun! haha... Mentally... simply cause i had to put on a false front the whole damn day. Yup, certainly false front. I don't know since when, but a wave of depression and sadness hit me, and well, i guess it showed early in the morning all the way till PE. PE allowed me to release whatever negative energy that i was running abundant on and well, it lightened that feeling of... i don't know, erm... Anger, fear, misery, frustration, jealousy, CONFUSION... yeah... but, after that, i guess, many of my friends grew worried and thus, we their care and regular jokes, i lightened up and i guess... put on a front so that they wouldn't worry so much...  why am i feeling like that?! i don't know honestly speaking... damn, i feel so tired, don't feel like continuing, but nevermind... shall try... now addressing the topic... i think it's quite easy to tell what am i talking about... Chris  Valarie, at least knows and understands what is it all about lah... but, basically, now i am at a lost, really at a lost... so many paths to take, yet so afraid to take them. Fear of falling, fear of losing all that i value... all that i know... all... that... i... love and like...  Waiting, what exactly do you mean by waiting? i honestly don't know anymore... to wait there like a dimwit with absolutely no sense of direction? to wait there with passion, forever being optimistic? or... to wait for a period of time, knowing that it is hopeless, yet trying so hard, struggling, to get and earn what you or i want? i don't know, which 1 do i fall into anymore... i used to think that it was the 2nd one, waiting so passionately, never once letting any obstacle to bring me down or make me feel so low... yet now, i feel lost, not knowing which direction i should take, where and how am i supposed to wait. Simply put, tired... Honestly speaking, i do carry lots of hope, but sometimes, there is a cause of wonder... Wondering whether i am waiting for a hopeless cause, just wasting my life away? Oh wait, wasting is not the right word, as waiting for this particular reason is special to me. However, i do understand that, all may come to lost, but... i guess, i will just say this, for now at least, i will wait passionately, wait and give with whatever i have... though... it may come to naught... no matter what, i will always be there for that special person and reason... of... LOVE? LIKE? i'll leave it to your hands to decide what i am feeling. Ultimately, all i can say is that the reason why i am waiting, is simple. The person has grown to become a very special part of my life and that, i don't think it's ever to go back to my old self or normal life with her out of my life.  Yup... ok, another thought... am i also feeling cause recently i haven't been putting enough time or spending enough time with GOD? i think that it plays a part too... However, i guess, right now, i just want everyone and anyone to pray for one another and wish their on friends and family to remain strong and supportive. Especially me, whom i want to pray for the safety and happiness of my friends. The need of saving of my parents into the Christian faith, hopefully it would come soon. To friends and family who are always there for me, i pray to GOD and thank him for them for being blessings in my life. To others that have been there one way or another, thank you! To everyone... God Bless! Let's all have faith in GOD and pray that he clears our mind and empowers us! Take care to all! and... Keep that optimistic spirit! :p
