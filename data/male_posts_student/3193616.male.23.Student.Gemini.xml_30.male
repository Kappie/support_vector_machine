This has long intrigued me. The avowed objective of Tigers is to have a Aganda Tamizhagam- including the present Tamilnadu and parts of Srilanka. This will never be possible without riping apart both India and Srilanka- which is completely unacceptable to me. Though I speak Tamil Iam an Indian First and then comes What ever. I dont also understand the behaviour of Tigers- They know for sure they will never be able to get their demand met, yet they keep killing themselves and others. It took India the Life of a Young Leader with lots of Potential to understand that Tigers areNever to be trusted and only after this, there had been some improvement. Though even now, there are certain select few who still prefer supporting LTTE, there is no popular support for the Movement. People have understood their back stabbing and I dont think will forget that Incidence ever.
