That's really a shame, I only took this place because he said he'd be staying a couple nights a week.  Cindy burned herself really badly last night.  I haven't seen it yet, but it apparently started blistering almost immediately and she's peeling.  I gave her the advice I have, I hope she's okay.  Mom is coming to town today to give blood.  I'm going to try to meet her for lunch.  We'll see if Garry lets me take a longer lunch.  He shouldn't mind, but you never know.  Not really looking forward to today, it's gonna be a long one.
