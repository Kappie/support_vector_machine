But enough of that but still in a related subject Im getting rather anoyed that everybody is talking about Idol which every country has had ther version of (Pop Idol in the UK and American Idol in US). Ive seen it once and it kind of sucks first of all the most popular one sucks, the only hot girl got woted out the last time. The fifth one (that will be thrown out tonight) only sings slow romantic songs which is ok but he sometimes just takes fast paced songs and slows them down until you run away crying your eyes out. If somebody remembers the guy in was always singing in front of Cafe Zurich (I know I write it wrong) then its not that bad the same feeling just not as strong.  Now everybody is watching this show exept me, Im working. The reason why these two subjects are a bit related  is that the goy who sang "Hiroshima" is Icelandic Idols Simon, the person everybody loves to hate. He is an admirable person cause he had Icelands best selling album for 15 years staight (different album each year hes not our Bill and Ted).  I just finished writing my beloved Seema a Email and was telling her about somethings that are so strange. For example I had some funny feeling that something was not as usual today I found it out around at noon that my wallet was in the back pocket where it hadnt been since I first came to Barcelona and was adviced to put in the front pocket.  The other thing which doesnt put me off but is still strange, when I take the elevator at school and am going down Im always waiting for the floor number zero to come up on little screen.    Tomorrow Im going to babysit my favorite cousins two boys 3 and 5 years they are so adorable, always playing and saying jokes, Im realy looking forward to it. These boys are so good friends and so alive they sometimes fight but at the end of the day they are always best friends.  Well I dont appetite for more writing so...   hasta la proxima, Ingi/Ãšlli
