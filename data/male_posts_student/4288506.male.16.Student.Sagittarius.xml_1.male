It is simply a common sense method of letting people know youre available without being tacky or obnoxious. AND if done properly, it is your best chance at snagging your future partner! So, get ready to demystify the art of flirting with these five fabulous flirting tips. Practice your new moves on the object of your desire this weekend    #1: Be SincereIf youre going to flirt, you need to be real about it. Anyone can spot a fake a mile away. If youre feeling insecure about your flirting skills, dont start with your secret crush since the 10th grade. Begin in a situation you are most comfortable with. If youre going to pay compliments to someone, be sincere about them. Really mean what you are saying and your results will be well worth the effort.    #2: SmileA smile is the simplest form of flattery. It shows that you are genuinely interested in the other person, and for that one single moment they are the only thing on your mind. Never underestimate the power of a smile.    #3: TouchTouch is an obvious sign of interest. Used correctly it can be a subtle way of getting a persons undivided attention. Rest a hand on their arm or on their knee when you are talking. Engage in activities that promote touch, such as dancing. Just be careful not to appear too flirtatious. The last thing you want to do is send the wrong signals.    #4: Hold Eye ContactHow do you make the object of your affection weak in the knees? Hold that meaningful gaze for just a few seconds longer than normal. Show them youre not one to turn away from something great!    #5: Be Interested In ThemWant to know if they are worthy of your undivided attention? Find out more by asking them open-ended questions about themselves. Show off your flirting skills by showing them you are actually listening to what they are saying. Bonus Tip:Dont forget to show your appreciation for the person spending time with you. Always thank the person you are with, and let them know if you had a good time with them. A little politeness goes a long way to making you the next catch of the day.
