I am not going though, why not? Here is who is with them: Linkin Park, Korn, The Used, and (get this) Snoop Dogg  That should be a fucked up concert, but Less Than Jake has done this before, some other people they have toured with are P. Diddy and Bon Jovi. Sick.  Reel Big Fish is coming to Freedom Hill on June 29th with Catch 22, The RX Bandits and more, that might be a decent concert, but isnt Freedom Hill the place where you can sit on the grass or get those seats up front and it is outside? That would be weird.  The Lawrence Arms return to Michigan on August 2nd with Tsunami Bomb and others, they are at the Shelter, I'm going to try and go to this one.  That's all I found for now, I know, not many people are coming for awhile, it sucks, hopefully my cousin will have a shitload of concerts I can go to when he returns from tour in June.  Oh yea, I did find this though:  urlLink Click .  It is a Japanese animation of the "I Believe I Can Fly" cover by Me First And The Gimme Gimmes, there are a lot of cute animals :).  that's all for now.
