Was nice, some interesting code conversation was overheard between Tim and Alex Rabkin, and once again the legend of the Katie Minnock conversation lives on. (That story was started right here by the way uncovered by yours truly) bwhahaha.  Now a final (deciding) math test and math exam... then I am DONE!!! DONE DONE DONE DONE DONE DONE DONE DONE DONE DONE   can see I'm excited?
