The gist is - US Trade reps are going to start attacking price controls over seas on drugs, listing them as a trade barrier that must be removed.  The idea is to increase prices overseas so the foreign consumer pays thier fair burden of the R costs, and allows prices to come down in the US.  As it is, the US subsidizes R costs for the entire world through higher prices.  The interesting quote is as follows -   [Sen Jon Kyl, R-Ariz said] "'The answer in the U.S. is not that we should adopt price controls,' he said. 'We should work with other countries to reduce or eliminate price controls.'  Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., said he agreed, but that 'leaving drug pricing policy entirely to drug manufacturers may not be the best idea either. The market has not contained prices that private plans and employers pay for drugs here in the U.S.'"  OK, think about that sentence - "leaving drug pricing policy entirely to drug manufacturers may not be the best idea..."  How about - "leaving soda pricing policy entirely to soda manufactureres may not be the best idea."  "leaving retail pricing of DVDs entirely to retail chains may not be the best idea."  Or how about - "leaving salary demands entirely to workers may not be the best idea..."  Why are drugs any different?
