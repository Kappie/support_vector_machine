It was nearly two hours long. After the movie we went to Starbucks and then to Nations. Silly girl, she kept on throwing fries at me.  We went bowling afterwards and I think she spent more then $40 on games. We played a couple of racing games and we played this one weird prize winning game that I got addicted to a 'lil bit. Probably spent more then $5 on that one alone. Then her mom picked us up and we went to Safeway to get gas and food for them.   Now I am home, with nothing to do. Waiting to talk to people's.   She probably gets to go to Merced with us this weekend. It's my Nana and Papa's 50th wedding anniversary and we are having a big party, and Dominique was invited. Isn't that neat-o?  Anyways, see ya later.  "Doug McKenzie: I am your father, Luke. Give in to the dark side of the force, you knob.  Bob McKenzie: He saw Jedi 17 times, eh." --Strange Brew
