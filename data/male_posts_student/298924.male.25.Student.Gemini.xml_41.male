This is my favorite time of year besides the cold weather....I love reuniting with my friends and family and knowing that life can be simple....  I have some inner turmoil going on....I swear if I ever get married it will be through some minor miracle....I can think of the countless women I have had feelings for and never told them....the list is endless....I don't know whether I am scared of rejection, scared of how it might change the way things are, or just scared in general....I need a resolution....  I got a chance to catch up on the Real World this weekend....upon further review Coral is okay with me....Nicole is insecure....and Mike and Malik are just plain cool....everyone else is non-descript to me....oh yeah Lori still can't sing....  I think that is all for now....
