Ah well..English prelim oral yesterday went very very well..arrived in sch real early to play some soccer...wooah..i hit the post and smashed the post but still wasn't able to score..argh..and nic was able to get a hat-trick..cool man...the impending oral was making wei zhi real nervous..lol..but he was the last one..so i tried to calm him down..  man..the wait was extremely long..but eventful though..lol..we invented a new game "rubbish paper basketball" or something like that i think..lol..we just crushed one piece of paper and moulded into something which resembled a ball and tried to score by shooting it into the rubbish bin. Sounds pretty childish..but it was quite fun...some crappy combination of chapteh and soccer i guess..lol.  oh well..i was 2nd last..and i was getting quite nervous..and well i just sat down and thought of some stuff.."why was i getting nervous..i was afraid that i won't perform well right..but getting nervous won't help me get better remarks and impressing the examiner..so i should just get the nervous sensation out of me and make an attempt to display some extent of savoir-faire..lol.."  So..i began mumbling to myself..."Let the rational thinking mind take control and let go of any distressing sensations.." and woah..it really worked wonders..trudged into the room with overwhelming confidence(not over-confidence)hehe...was really worried that laura ng might have recalled that i was a debater so she would be extremely stringent..but luckily she did not..lol..and it went really well..not a single prompt...just one question..that's bout it..and it ended off really well...  she commented.."Good..very good...do you take literature?"   Well obviously i denied it..and she replied.."what a pity..."   lol..feeling rather "ego" now..pardon me..wahahaha...so ppl...anitime when ur nerves are getting the better of u..tell yourself..let the "rational thinking" mind take over..lol..it really helps..=)  haha..was feeling really good..so went out with xavier, jon, ks and xavier's senior...first went for lunch at scotts' picnic...guess who we met there...lol...lokelf sia..lol..apparently she went there right after eng oral as well..she was there alone with kalavathi..really didn't expect to see her there man..lol..den went to the usual place for pool..must say..lady luck was really on my side..and i was kinda on form i guess..lol..i won every game i played..lol. It totally rocked man..went to play LAN for the first time in 3 months..and lol..still did very well...surprisingly so...lol..and went back home to play football once again.lol.  For some reason..something struck me to learn beckham..perhaps aspiring to be better than him...lol..so i decided to imitate him and learn his "trademark freekick"..first time..didn't exactly work well...so i said to myself.."ahhh..didn't bend my back enough..." so well..i tried a second time bending my back much more..and OMG. i was absolutely gobsmacked after i took the shot...it went straight into the top right hand corner..en route it swerved diagonally down...it was a sublime shot..lol..it was really fantastic..wahaha..  Dun mind me..i'm in a very very good mood now...haha..albeit something wasn't exactly achieved yesterday...only 2 ppl would know pertaining to which matter..so yeah..nvm..i don't think it matters anymore..
