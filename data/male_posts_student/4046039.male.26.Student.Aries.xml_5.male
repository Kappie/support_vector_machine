The gospel, “good news,” is widely viewed as little more than harmless religious gossip: shallow, trite, ineffectual.  What is our response?  Some of us forsake the gospel, some of us agree and don't read the gospel, some of us read too much into the gospel to answer the questions of society...  Just be faithful to God...his word is tried, tested and true.
