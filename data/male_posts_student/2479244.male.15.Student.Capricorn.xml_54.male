So I have half a fake tooth, and today I had it replaced after 3 years of stains and decay. So why should I write about this? I have no idea. But the thing that I liked about this was that I got it done and over with without trying to put it off like so many things I do.   I guess that a few things that have happened recently have sparked a lot of change in my life. I am glad for that.
