He looked at it, thought for a second, and then quoted Mr. Jack Handy:   "If you saw two guys named Hambone and Flippy, which one would you think liked dolphins the most? I'd say Flippy, wouldn't you? You'd be wrong, though. It's Hambone."    Hambone the dolphin is everyone's favorite toy now.  Mostly because he's so squishy; you can throw him and catch him and use him as a pillow.  However, it is not cool ( Yaron , I am looking in your direction) to shove Hambone's tail fin up his butt and make fun of him for it.
