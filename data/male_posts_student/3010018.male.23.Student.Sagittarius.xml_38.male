The following is more for Naveed (my brother) than anyone else: so in NBA Live, i continued my franchise that i had started b4 with the Pistons, that had Dwayne Wade, Jermaine O'Neal, and Michael Redd......i changed the settings to the more realistic settings that i was tellin you about....In free agency i decided to trade away Grant Hill and Robert Horry, their ratings went down alot and their contracts were huge which was really keeping me from getting any help on my bench...I traded Robert Horry and Jason Kapono and got Devean George and I sent Grant Hill away for some guy named Borchardt..he is a power forward, he is pretty good i guess.....so my starting lineup goes like this Wade, Redd, George, O'Neal, Mihm.......I signed Chris Mihm to a mutli-year deal worth 150k/year (for those of you unfamiliar with NBA live, the numbers are points not dollars) and made him my starting center.....he is only a 59 right now but i think his ratings will go way up as a starter.....i picked up Charlie Ward, Mark Madsen, Wesley Person, and a couple of other guys in free agency..most of my bench i didnt get back from last season (by the way, i lost in the Eastern Conf Finals in Game 7, i simulated the playoffs, just for fun) Horace Grant and Brian Shaw retired and everyone else i didnt sign back or keep (i made some off season trades) except for Josh Howard, he is a scoring machine..........Sacramento won the NBA championship with C-Webb, Bibby, and Peja.....almost exact replica of the current Kings team....anyway, thats my NBA live franchise update........  Messege to Mark Cuban: You better have some big blockbuster deal coming this summer for the Mavericks......if you dont, you have alot of explaining to do for why you let Steve Nash get away....we needed him!!! You better get Shaq ......hear me Cubes ? You better get Shaq.....(but dont give up Nowitzki) I dont care if you have to dump the rest of the team but do not trade Dirk!!! Send Stackhouse, Walker, Podkolzine, and Delk along with new free agent (from Golden State) Dampier (sign him to a good fat contract, that will help match Shaq's fat contract too) and get SHAQ!! And then make a smart free agency move and sign Derek Fisher ! We need a good starting point guard and we all know Devin Harris isnt gonna do it (not yet at least) There is the Mavericks blue print for success, starting lineup for 2005, D-Fish, Finley, Howard, Dirk, Shaq......and if the Lakers still want more givem Bradley and Abdul-Wahad (stop for laughter) yea right, who is gonna take them ?
