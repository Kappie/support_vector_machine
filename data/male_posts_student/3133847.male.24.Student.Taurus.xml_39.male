Cheers, good wishes, and basically everyone was in a very good mood, in spite of the continuous rain. The guards came up to see what was the matter.Sunday morning, no one really wants to study but classes go on as usual. We sit through them and raced to the mess where we spend a good hour singing boisterously. Evening, most of us went to the city but it was raining heavily, so not much fun there.  More presentations coming up, and also the exams, so I'm studying a bit now. Suffering from cold, sore throat, cough and fever. Great timing.
