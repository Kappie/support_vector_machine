Hmm? erm...stayed back waited for hui...she came over..and lalala....ok this is continued from like 5 hours ago cos i left it on...so yeh, just came back. went to drink, with kel. i drank, uhh....ice lemon tea. and kel had barons. had manly talk..heheh. okok i'll go play grand theft auto. Hope it works and doesnt screw up like the risk2 i downloaded. BITORRENT KICKS ASS!
