Only me, hope and wish These days there's nothing to do there is only a me and never a you i wished i was loved like i wanted to be i wished i was loved by more than just me I feel all alone only emptiness in me my family always moans and refuse to treat me as i am, grown i know i am not grown but i am more than a ball to be thrown from wall to wall of this family of mine my rope of hope is almost gone now mearly a twine my only wish is to feel like a family this constant war is hell in my life going back and fourth not knowing what to believe, but then i remember it is only me me who is not loved by anyone else me who wants to hug, but never has felt the love i want to feel from more than just me they all have love, a family of one. i hope for one day a normal life and for all those putrid souls i spit at them with spite and hope that the night of my departure will be taken as easily for them as it will be for me
