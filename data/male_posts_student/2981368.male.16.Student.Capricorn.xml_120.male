Everyone was in  really  posh clothes...like, all the boys were wearing jackets 'n' bow ties 'n' things, all the girls were wearing ball gowns. And everyone looked great! Spent most the evening chatting...bit of *attempted* dancing as well. The yellow mini was pretty damn cool as well, especially when it had its fairy lights in as well. Everything is generally too hard to explain or describe, so for the rest I'm gonnae wait for photos.  In the other news, I today completely re-made  urlLink my site . Yup. Its now actually up to date, and has nothing to do with anything in particular. And I reaaaaaally like that splash page. Worked better than expected.  So yeah.  urlLink Get yo asses down to ma site, 'n' have a look round. As usual, complaints, suggestions 'n' things are welcome. Oh, and theres a caption compo in the pics area. So...go go go. What're you waiting for?
