While he remains a polarizing figure for some, his administration continues to serve as an example for conservatives seeking to build political consensus.  In its pursuit of a politically expedient  urlLink solution  to the question of stem cell research, however, the current Bush administration has undermined progress in a field of medicine that shows great  urlLink promise  for treatment of the very disease that afflicted Reagan in his later years.  While no one would suggest that Bush's reluctant stance contributed directly to his predecessor's death, Nancy Reagan has strongly advocated changing the policy and supporting the type of stem cell research that could help prevent countless others from suffering the effects of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes, and other recalcitrant diseases.  Elected officials have a strong moral obligation to support research that will improve the lives of their constituents, despite the vocal opposition of a conservative minority within the religious community.  Just last month, Mrs. Reagan  urlLink expressed  her continuing frustration: "I just don't see how we can turn our backs on this...  We have lost so much time already.  I just really can't bear to lose any more."
