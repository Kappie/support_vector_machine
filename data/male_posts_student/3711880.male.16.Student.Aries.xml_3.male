The only thing that's missing is a memorycard (damn, I've already said that? or? my memory's, like, the worst ;)  But you don't really care, now do you? Some "news": Tenjyou Tenge has been licensed by DarkHorse (yesh, bebby) and they've also licensed the great seinen Madara. DarkHorse holds a very high quality when they print their books, so I'm more than happy to hear that it wasn't Viz that licensed the books (god, forbid). And for you shoujo-fanns out there: a new anime from CLAMP has been announced, and will air on August 1st. (source:  urlLink animenewsnetwork.com ) It's old news, but I haven't been able to survey them.
