It is the story of a woman, played by Drew Barrymore, who has no short term memory, thanks to an accident. The story begins when Sandler meets Lucy(Drew Barrymore) and starts to like her. The next day he finds that she has no recollection of him. After trying for a few more days Lucy's father tells him not to go to the cafe where Lucy goes every 'Sunday'(everyday). So he invents ways to meet her on her way. The comedy continues till one day Lucy finds him on her bed, and start hitting him. From thereon the move moves on a more serious note, but still there is enough comedy to laugh quite a few times.  How the move goes? Well you should see it, because, I am not a very good story teller. So go and watch "50 First Dates".
