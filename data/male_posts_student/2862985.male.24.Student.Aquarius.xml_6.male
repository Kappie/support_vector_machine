Some are too bo liao that I feel that it would be a waste of time and space putting here. Haha..    Ok, let's talk about yesterday first. Basically the most interesting thing about yesterday is when I went to change my dad's car tyre at Toh Yee Drive. The tyre shop we went is actually not a very big shop and it only has one worker and the boss himself. The interesting thing is the boss. He must be one of the most blur boss that I have ever seen. He can even talk to himself or hold two phones at a time and talk at the same time. if you do not know him, he would appear a bit mentally unstable to you. He is very very busy, always going about to do things (well, he has only one worker and his business is actually not bad at all because his tyres are really cheap) and listening to phone calls.  Then I saw a portrait of his wife on the wall. Gosh, you won't believe that such a blur man can have a really pretty wife. And do you still remember the incident when the wife of a man who sells car at Great World City went to smash 13 of his cars when she realised that he has a mistress who is the TV actress Wang Yu Xiang? Yah, he has the newspaper cutting pasted on his wall just beside his wife's portrait. It somehow gives me the feeling that he is the man. But then, he looks so blur to me that it would be really unbelievable if he can get a fling outside.  Not only is the boss blur, he also is being fucked and scolded by his customers and even his own worker! There's this customer who keep scolding him CB that he is taking his own sweet time and wasting his precious time. And the blur boss just take it in and never show his temper once. Well, just imagine, when the clock hits 12.30pm sharp, his worker just leave everything to his boss to do and went about his lunch, leaving the poor boss to settle everything. My gosh, such a blur and easily bullied boss, I also want next time.. hee..  However Ace told me that most probably he is just acting blur. When it comes to quoting prices, he is faster than anybody else. If he sees a rich customer (i.e those people driving merz or BMW etc), he would quote a relativey higher price. And I really believe that he is not blur, else how can he have made his business so big and successful that he is opening a second shop at East Coast? Hence it came to my conclusion that he just wants to give his customers and worker the feeling that he is blur and would not cheat them, but actually he is laughing inside at how stupid these people are.  So, at the end of the day, do you think pride is more important or money is more important? To the boss, obviously pride means nothing. However to me, I surely cannot stand it when people scold me.  Today, went to Malaysia with dad to settle some property transfer things. He also set up a stock account for me in Malaysia. Well, very boring day in there as we have to go a lot of banks and law firms and accounting firms to settle a lot of documents. Tiring also and I slept on the way back.  Have been rather moody these few days. Hope that I did not affect the people around me. But I think I have already done so. So here's apologies to you.. hee.. although you don't know about my site, still I want to tell you I'm sorry.. hee..  Ok la, here's a little meaningful quote for everybody, taken from Vivian's website :  "For every minute you are angry. You lose 60 seconds of happiness."
