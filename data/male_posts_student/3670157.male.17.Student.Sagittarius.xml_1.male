So I sat down and wrote something. Exactly a month later I through out what I wrote and wrote this. But I wrote this about another person for Jen. I hope she still likes it as much.  Name the Stars  By: Jeff Bell  It is impossible to live With society turned away When pain is all it gives And all you can do is pray  I could never begin to tell you How great you’ve always been To always see me through My woe and perils without end      Chorus  You can’t measure friendship You can’t name every star Or count the footsteps of your trip Nor imagine how awesome you are  You are always first to be there When life’s burdens knock at my door To end this hopeless despair And help lift me up off the floor  I know you’ll never let me down You’ll always wish to care The day that you were found Someone heard my prayer   Bridge     Chorus  You can’t measure friendship You can’t name every star Or count the footsteps of your trip Nor imagine how awesome you are
