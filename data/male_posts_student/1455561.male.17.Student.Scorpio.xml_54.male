Although i dont think the two lithuanian visitors will be too involved.  This rob guy is making his own blog.  It's special.  Here it  urlLink is   Just to make it clear to anyone who went there, he doesnt really have over 1000 hits.  He set it to that to give the illusion of popularity.  Yes, i know this blog isnt exactly popular, but i dont really want people i know to read it so dont tell anyone.  I like the way he is pretending to be someone completely different online, hinting at himself having some sort of fantastic alter ego, whereas he is like that in real life too.  Imagine it if you will.  ah well, i cant exactly complain about other peoples blogs.    I will though because thats the way i am.
