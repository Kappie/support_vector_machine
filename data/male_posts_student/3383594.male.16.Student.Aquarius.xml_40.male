They can realli be fun and great to be wif, but sometimes they juz dun noe their limit. They keep on going without stopping and without thinking of how the person actually feels. They will probably treat it as a joke without realising how much pain they had caused for the other person. Tt's how I realli feel rite now. I won't say I'm pissed, but I'll definitely say tt I'm disappointed. The reason is tt I feel realli close wif this person and I juz think tt this person shld understand me more than others, but to do something like tt juz proves to me tt I'm wrong. I guess tt in life, some mistakes juz cannot be avoided no matter how hard u try to. I juz hope tt this person, or preferably these ppl will noe their limit and not overdo it. I realli wish tt they can juz show some care and concern towards me, but the way i see it, it's nearly impossible. Like the Black Eyed Peas would say "Where Is The Love?"  Nothing much happened today, I juz bought a infrared port for my computer. It cost me $39, but I feel tt it'll definitely be cheaper than constantly sending things frm my mobile phone to my computer. Tt's the reason why I bought it. I'm like realli sleepy and drunk rite now, but still apparently open-minded. I definitely feel rejected, dejected, disappointed and so much more, but there's nothing I can do. If onli I could cast a spell, but tt would totally change somebody, he or she wouldn't be the same anymore. I'm drifting away rite now, I'm drunk, haha. Drinking pretty much helps when u're depressed u noe? Especially if u've got a hugh bottle or like 10 cans. Haha, but even though I'm so damn drunk, I'll probably be unable to slp. These kindda things clot up my head and stays there. It stops me frm slping till I actually solve the goddamnit problem and shitz. So this is pretty much the way I feel rite now.  "I am shock by the amount of disrespect u've got." - Paula Abdul, judge of American Idol. Oh hell wif this thing, I dun even noe how to conclude it. Let's juz say i aint gonna end this shitz till i actually do solve this shitz although I dun even haf a single idea of wad I'm typing rite now, but I'm sure it's the truth. I dun even noe wad I've been tryin to say, but heck wif it, I dun care. So wad more do u wan rite now huh? This is sick, juz sick!
