No real change in the world, other than no exams left.  It's not like the school blew up.  Oh, wait, that would be a different law school.   urlLink Explosion at Yale Law School .  Scary stuff.  My initial theory was that someone's head got too big and just blew up.  But that's only funny if the story wasn't true.  It's pretty frightening, actually.
