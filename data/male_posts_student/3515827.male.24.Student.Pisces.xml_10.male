Spiderman 2  Originally I, along with some friends, went to the  urlLink Charles  to see Fahrenheit 9/11 on Sunday, but it were sold out so we saw Saved instead.  It was defiantly a smart alternative, a delightful romp if you must.  Funny and cute, it was like Mean Girls, but about the confusion a young mind encounters with Christianity instead of popularity.  Some, particularly those that saw The Passion of The Christ 437 times, will easily dismiss it.  In the film, each character's blind devotion and all consuming faith in Christianity hinders them from asking any question regarding their viewpoints, choices and actions.  The antagonists, a Jewish girl and a wheelchair bound MaCaulay Culkin are great.    I'm not saying it is a profound film and should be taken seriously, it is still a comedy in the end.  And I must add that I really like Mandy Moore more and more.  Out of all the girls, (Brittany, Christina, Jessica) I find her the most sincere and naturally beautiful.  She does a wonderful job in this film although I have trouble believing she has any range at all as an actress.  As for  Fahrenheit 9/11, I defer you to  urlLink Paul Krugman's  take, which fits mine rather well.  As for the flaws Krugman notes, Spinsanity has done all the  urlLink research  for me.  I like Moore, sometimes.  When he acts like the Ann Coulter of the left I wish he'd shut up.  I feel that making Bush look bad is easy, but in his typically style, he just had to resort to half truths to make his point and grab some headlines.  I guess noting the pipeline will make people's eye grow larger than telling people how Bush steamrolled the CIA into giving them the info in the way they wanted it.    Overall, there was very little I already hadn't read somewhere online at sometime.  Everything else I met with skepticism.  Now if only the media had done their job two years ago, this movie (it is certainly not a documentary as it is not objective) would had never been made.  The worst was that there was a guy selling Tshits outside the theater with a headshot of Prez 39 and 41 with the caption Dumb and Dumber.  Come on now, we're better than that.  I know the guy was only trying to make a quick buck, but how insightful are those tshits?  Not very.  It caused me to roll my eyes in the same fashion as when those wacky Bush backers calls John Kerry the "friend of the French."  As for Spiderman 2, it kicked ass.  The only inevitable problem is that the more successful it becomes, the more others try to ride the wave with crappy clones (Daredevil anyone?).    The next installment is due in three years and though I know what it will be about(the ending is none to subtle), I still wonder what it will be about.  Is Peter's inner turmoil being Spiderman over?  Will he and Mary Jane get their freak on?  Will Aunt Mae have to sell her pain pills on the street to make rent?  Will Harry Osborn give into his lust for Peter and become his new arch enemy, The Turd Burglar?   On a side note, I always thought  urlLink Franco  was extremely beautiful since I discovered him in Freaks and Geeks, a series that (I'm still bitter) was yanked from the air.  He has nice lips, high cheekbones, and great, wonderful, bedroom eyes.  But he doesn't look good in this film, nor the first one.  My guess is that because Tobey Maguire is the star but also homely looking, the crew had to make Spiderman's future enemy less attractive.  Even though a bad day for Franco is still an unattainable good day for Maguire.
