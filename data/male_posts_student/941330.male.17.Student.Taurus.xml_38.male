Nothing much, I think I won in fantasy basketball...chem sucks...I ran a bit, got some weird pain in my chest and my breath sounded wheezy, I hope it's nothing...Legend of Zelda ROCKS!...I fixed Erik's computer after helping to break it...Michael Jordan was really good today, and the Lakers' white jerseys are tres uber.  Wow...that was pretty boring. Guess I had nothing much to write. Tonight was a lot better than last night.
