Years later, it was the first movie I purchased on DVD.  Imagine my joy and excitement yesterday as I browsed the aisles at my local  urlLink Best Buy  and saw a copy of  urlLink The Monster Club  on DVD for $9.99. Released directly to TV in America,  urlLink The Monster Club  was a stepchild of the  urlLink Amicus horror anthologies  of the 60s and 70s. The movie is a who's who of horror:  urlLink Roy Ward Baker ,  urlLink Vincent Price ,  urlLink John Carradine ,  urlLink Simon Ward ,  urlLink Geoffrey Bayldon ,  urlLink Donald Pleasence ,  urlLink Britt Ekland ,  urlLink Patrick Magee , and  urlLink Roy Ashton . Add a great soundtrack by a bunch of bands that never broke in America, and you've got an evening of prime entertainment!  This movie really takes me back to the early 1980s. We were the first family on our block to have one of those newfangled VCRs (a Montgomery Ward!) and one of the first things I ever recorded was  urlLink The Monster Club  off of  urlLink WOR-TV . I've probably watched this flick a couple dozen times over the course of my life and it's as nostalgic for me as looking at my high school yearbook. This isn't a great movie. It's a movie that's so bad it's great! Remember -- MONSTERS RULE O.K.!!!
