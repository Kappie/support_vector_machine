So I've been reminiscing the good things of the year and blocking out the bad things that gnaw on my brain in the most painful possible manor. I could reminisce here, but that would take forever, and I'm sure you don't want to read that anyways. But overall, I must say, it's been a pretty good year.  On the last day of school today, I took my Gym final (eeeasy). After that, all I had was Global Village, in which we had already passed in final essays. So Brandon, Chris F., Chris G., and I played Gameboy whilst the rest of the class played kickball. I would've played, but I don't like kickball. Or moving. ;) Brandon let me play Metroid: Zero Mission. I got confused alot. I got to fight some big worm thing. Is it just me, or do all first bosses/mini-bosses involve waiting for their eye(s) to open and then shooting them like mad? Anyways, I got bored of that after a while (read as: I died), so I stole Chris G.'s Pokemon game. While he was looking. And I still have it. I hope he doesn't want to play over the summer. ^^;;  Since getting home, I've been listening to Bad Hair Day by Weird Al (as I do on every last day of school) and playing  urlLink Achaea  (which I've gotten back into for about the fifth time). And I ate a Lunchable (still cool!) for lunch.  Ah, free at last. So glad it's summer. Any longer at school, and I think I'd explode. I say this every summer, and it's usually a lie, but I'm going to say it anyways: This is gonna be the best summer ever. :D
