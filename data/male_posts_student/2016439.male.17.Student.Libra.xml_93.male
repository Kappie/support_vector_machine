Green from dirt and mud and foul-smelling water from the last rains. But if I can't hit someone else, I may as well hit you. You and I, along with our friend the Brick Wall, have had some good times together. Sometimes I'll hit you one way and he'll hit you back another, but instead of getting upset, I just laugh. How stupid of me to expect things to always come back my way. Some of your skin is starting to come off, but I'm too tired to sew it back on. Thanks for being such a good friend.
