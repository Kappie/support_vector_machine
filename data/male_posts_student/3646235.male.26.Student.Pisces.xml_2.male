I went shopping for her birthday gifts, got my car inspected and registered, and looked into a wedding present for her.  I missed her and Ella, but it was nice not having to take Ella out or play with her.  I needed a break.  We head to Dallas next weekend for the 4th.  Going to spend it with her family (her brothers live there).  The weekend after that Ella and I head to Houston since my parents are coming in to look at rehersal dinner places.  Alicia will be at a conference.  She's out most of July with conferences and workshops.  Just me and the dog.  Ella will be spending a lot of time at daycare!  Research is going fine.  I started 6 arrays today.  When I finish them, I'll have 9 I need to grid.  Blah.  Damn cell lines are on backorder, so I may have some time where I'm not doing anything.  I hate wasting time like that.  I need to call Houston for a different cell line, but I'm nervous talking to people on the phone whom I've never met.  I need to do that this week.  Word of the Day: tenacious - persistent; stubborn
