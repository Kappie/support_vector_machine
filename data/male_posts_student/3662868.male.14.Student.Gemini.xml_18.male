It was leaning on a fence, and two other trees, and lead to the other part of the woods, where it fell. So when my first friend told me he had it, I was like "eh, that sucks" and didn't think about it much. Then my other friend told me and I'm like..."Hmm..hope I don't get it". Now I've got it on my right leg, my left arm, and I think its on my face now too. This sucks. And I was just thinking. In war, you have to be prepared to order your men to their deaths. But what happens when orders aren't given? Fubars just like this. All 3 of us got poison ivy, and for what reason? Because they followed me on to the tree. They shouldn't have. Even though it wasn't a real threat or anything, it was still dangerous. And I didn't realize the poison ivy vines were there till it was too late. Fuck.
