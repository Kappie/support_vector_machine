     
      You ever check out other people's journals and see something like:  "Men are complete dogs" or "Its great that women are so f**** understanding."  How passive aggressive is that move? If you got something to say say it.  With that said, I'm out.    PS Any chance that "analysis" has the word "anal" up front on purpose?  Just wondering
