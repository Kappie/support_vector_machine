Then, you need to hear about how my life is going overall. Also,some pictures from camp will be on my webspace, and I will link you to them in my next blog.   First off, Steve didn't get to go to camp.When I got there, my counselor seemed kind of corny, because he was trying to do a "get to know you" time, while I was trying to find Kari, Jess, Michelle,Dave Smithand more. So I compromised and found a way to get all of both in when I first got there. The first person I saw was Jess, the one I saw two months ago to begin with. She was in the line registering when we were. Next, I saw  urlLink Karen  and  urlLink Jenn  Bertsche (sisters- Karen is older). Karenran at me full forcein order to hugme (practically glomping me- "glomp" is Drea Davis' word for what Karen did), while Jenn just shook my hand. Next, I saw Kari. I saw her register and then I ran in order to see her with her mom and "sis" Erika. When I yelled "Hi" as I ran, Kari turned around, and "attacked" me when hugging me. Then, I was sitting in the gazebo by the youth tabernacle with Kari and Jenn, and Michelle walked out of it with several of her friends. I yelled "Hello" and Michelle, like the rest, ran at me full force and glomped me with all she had. Then she sat on my lap so the other side ofthe gazebowould not stain her clothes(green mildew or mold on the back of the seat). My roomates were Steve and Ty (cousins) also from Middlebury Center PA where Karen and Jenn are from, Eric Ruby (AKA Ruby), and my counselor Dave Barber (AKA Barbie), from  urlLink Lancaster Bible College  (who can be found in the picture  urlLink here  of Proof, the LBC group that counselled this year- Dave is the guy with the curly black hair in the gray shirt in the middle).   As soon as I got to camp God spoke stronger than ever. He convicted me of all the things I was putting before Him. He wrapped His arms around me and basically said, "I know why you're here this year. I know what you expect to get out of camp. So I'll give it to you right now. I love you. I know why you've replaced me, and I know what you have replaced me with, but I forgive you. You're my son and I love you."   Thenext things I will mention are my injuries. Monday morning heading to breakfast, I got lazy, so instead of getting on the porch by the ramp, I jumped on it like I always used to do, but this time banged right onto the porch on my shins. The scabs from that just now left my legs. Monday night right before everyone began playing the treasure hunt thing, I busted up my arm falling off of A-Tel-1's steps. It had a huge gash and lots of big bruises and swelling to the point that it didn't look like an elbow anymore. It was ridiculous. When I got my arm bandaged up and got a sling to help bring down the swelling, and sat in my A-Tel for a couple minutes alone, Satan found my weakest moment and attacked. He gave me a weird fear and told me that if I didn't leave camp that day, I'd leave camp in a body bag, but yet in my despair, I confused it with a message from God.I told Penny Espenshade, a counselor I have known for years,about it, and she told me to go see Paris, the head of the counselors. Paris got Dave to sit with us, and the three of us talked about it. Dave had me discern the difference between the two feelings of God speaking during the sessions, and the fear I had in the A-Tel. Easily, the difference was that God's was a warm feeling that I was His and He loved me and wrapped His loving arms around me in my time of need. The other was a fear unlike any fear I've ever had, and it felt evil. Dave said he once had the same trouble and confused an attack from Satan with a warning from God before. I decided to battle Satan and stay. It was the best decision I ever made.   My team was team number 4, God's Archangels.We eventually came up with acheer that ripped off the song "Na Na Hey Hey Hey Goodbye" that said, "Archangels! God's Archangels! Mess with us and you will die! Archangels, God's Archangels! We send Satan to Hell!" Our team was first place, second was"God's Gostoppo", the team of the only other high school graduate this year, Dave Smith, known as the boy with the weird patch of back hair. Kari, Jenn,and Michelle were part of the team that came in last. My team members were my roommatesSteve and Ty, 6 girls, most of which were related, and "Grandpa" Dave and "Grandma" Shelly Samaria who is part of the  urlLink Roberts Wesleyan University Youth Ministry Team. Grandma and Grandpa were the affectionate nicknames they had because Mister and Miss felt weird.   We played carpet pool, a weird ghetto game that Tim, the camp director created, and all kinds of stuff. Most memorable of games was "Gross Factor", spinoff of "Fear Factor"including a mixture of water and a couple dozen containers of cheese balls, making a nasty mixture when the cheese mixed with the water and the cheese balls were all soggy, and we had to dunk our heads in to get fireball candies from the bottom with our mouths. It was so nasty. Our team won that one. I was surprised with the girls we had. It freaked them out, but they were awesome, and handled it so well. I was so proud of them! Also, we did a water balloon target game, where you must use your body to block your target and one of our balloons ended up crushing a girl's hand to the point that she needed treatment.   Now, I must bust open the relationship issues. Michelle and my roomate Ruby once dated, and were going to again, but Ruby had to break off the idea saying that he was not going to get into a relationship to have to break it off when his schedule filled up too much in a couple months. Frankly, Michelle is awesome anddeserves the best, so she should be careful, and also I am sort of glad Ruby could realize that and be sure that he knew what he was getting himself into. Also, I was intending to ask Jess out soon, but I could tell that wasn't where I was supposed to be. The more I hung out with her, the more I felt God saying, "No no. No no." (That was also something Laura Hetke always said so obnoxiously to everyone! "No no. No no. No no.")   Now to talk about all the great talks we had in our group devos. In morning group devos, "Grandpa" Dave and "Grandma" Shelly led all kinds of relationships discussions and everything, and taught us the basics of a good Christian walk with God, how to live that way, knowing God's will, and choosing the perfect partner. They did well. In our guys-only devos at night, we had great talks that included treating ladies like godly men, and lots of thought provoking, mind blowing topics. When I was talking about how far I wander from God sometimes, "Grandma" Shelly especially told me about a Petra song that states, "Though you've walked a thousand miles, He's just a step behind."   Dave Smith was the only other graduate. Because of that, we got closer during the week. He used to just scare me because of that weird patch of back hair, but now we got to talking, espcially Thursday night when we took our "last walk" of the camp late that night and ended up playing some small pranks on the camp including putting the picnic tables up in pyramids and flippingsome over.We messed withe every picnic table and every chair on the campgrounds except those inthe guys' and girls' areas, so they wouldn't have any clue who was the culprit.   Dave and I were both in the talent show. Dave sang with Brenda Bittner and then Brenda dedicated a song to him that she wrote for her graduating class at her school. Michelle, Kari, Jenn, Mrs. Carolyn and Miss Kim sang "The Storm is Passing Over" with Michelle on piano. That was awesome. I played guitar and sang, performing Sonicflood's song "Lord Over All" completely acoustic. I've been told I was really good, so I trust everyone. Dave then ended the talent show singing "A Whole New World" like he did two years ago, a duet he did on his own. It's so weird it's awesome. I can get a hold of a small video of part of it if I beg Kari enough to send it to me from her digital camera.   I made several new friends, including Mary (AKA KessShanks/Longshanks), Becca (AKA Ber), Emily,Nate, Jon (AKA Bob, a name given to him by his counselor the year before that caught on to everyone else)and Michelle's friend Amanda.   The last day and also the time after the talent show were hard for some of us. Dave and I both cried, and Kari ran over to Dave and hugged him, in tears,then came to me, hugged me and cried harder, and then went back to Dave and then came back to me. The last day she just hugged us both. And of course you can't forget Michelle, whose total hugs with me that week came to about 762.3. (Kidding. Probably about 20 really!)   We had a great time, and I'm sure how long this is, you were bored poopless reading this thing. Well, Kari is probably having a great time reading this, laughing a bit at some of the things she remembers from this. And of course I am glad I get to archive this for as long as my page exists because I want to keep this entry to remember everything.    Anyway, as for life, I am getting a little irritated with my job, and I am considering leaving. I am definately looking for another job once I turn 18, but I am considering not waiting and getting a carry-over job and when I turn 18, getting an even better job that requires you to be 18. I still have no idea what I am doing, where I am going, or if I am even to have a future. I keep telling everyone that if I don't figure it out soon, I'll be living in a cardboard box. Once people yell at me, I say, "Hey, well at least moving will be easy!" Nah, I'm not afraid, "for I know who holds the future and I know who holds my hand." (from "Because He Lives" by Bill and Gloria Gaither)    Well that is all for now! (Finally!) Anyway, blog ya later and more often!   In Christ,  Mike  >
