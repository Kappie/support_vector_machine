I had been avoiding it because I just knew I was going to dislike it or that it would be seriously weak. I liked it and it wasn't even slightly weak.  So, normally what I would do at a time like this is run out and tell all of my friends (both of them) to see  urlLink this film  right away, but I won't because I'm apparently the last person on earth to see it.  Decent flick. Go  urlLink rent  it... again.
