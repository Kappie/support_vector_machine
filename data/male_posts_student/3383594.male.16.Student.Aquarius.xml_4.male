I admit it tt I'm upset, disappointed and a little pissed off too. I mean I can tell the difference between a joke and an insult. Maybe they think tt it's a joke and all tt crap, but there's always a limit. And they haf simply gone over it. I didn't even wanna look at them or be around them after school. It realli makes me feel tt whenever I'm being nice to them, they take a hell lot of advantage of me. They probably wouldn't feel the same way, cus they obviously do not noe wad's like. If onli they could understand and juz spare a tot for me, I'll be delighted. But the way I see it rite now, it's never gonna happen. The insults simply go on and on non stop, they probably didn't even care about how I feel. Tt's wad makes me upset and disappointed, to care for others so damn much and tt they dun even gif a shit bout' me. If this is gonna go on, I'm not gonna gif a shit bout' any relationships anymore damnit. After my 'O' Lvls, I'll juz hope tt I'll never see such ppl ever again. My emotions rite now juz cannot be describe in words. I juz hope tt they would think thru their actions...
