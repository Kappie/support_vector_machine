It is pronounced more like "an" with a... hard A or something. Some examples follow:  Let's go eata some pasta en? You maka no sense en? What the fuck, en? (This is where the title of the blog comes from)  So don't read it as "What the fuck, 'n'" anymore. It's "What the fuck, en?" Anyway, that joke just got unfunny by explaining it so I might rename the blog real soon.
