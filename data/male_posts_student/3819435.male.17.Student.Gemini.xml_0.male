I went to Beauty Mart and they sold me some nasty chemicals that burned the dye out of my hair (along with about 3 inches of my scalp!).Wow, that was some powerful crap! So anyway, tomorrow I take off for Las Vegas! Wa hoo! I'll pick up some cheap and tacky souvenirs  for y'all! I'll be back by Tuesday. See ya then! Lumps of Love!
