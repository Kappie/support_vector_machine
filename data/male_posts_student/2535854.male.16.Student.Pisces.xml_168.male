Ok so aint been able to update much here....so blogging at school..not exactly allowed to blog directly so im typing up all my stuff in my  urlLink  email    and mailing it back to myself so I can copy and paste when I get home so im like maybe not quite technically blogging at school.Haha...    I cant exactly see my blog site..so Im guessing I havent updated since last wednesday or something...but anyway....    last Thursday....school as usuall..yuck..and went for tuition...and damn..the number of tables out and ppl there on that day must be like 2 or 3 times more than the Friday class..theres like maybe 20 tables out?ok maybe 15 or so...and the number of people and noise...anyway choose that day since I know alotta people..but maybe ill opt for Tuesday`s class next time just for a change...but damn..that class is at like 6:15pm...so maybe Wednesday?...Anyway met aloota ppl....Ben was there..Kar leng as well...most of em Stella Maris ppl and stuff...but mainly over-run by hartamas ppl though...oddly at the begging of class I stuck around outside with Pearly (the hartamas 1) and Pei ling..they seemed to leave class since it was cold inside and stuff...and me wearing long sleeves found it hot..although outside was partly warm cause it rained earlier...    Anyway..not much at tuition and stuff happenning...learning that sust nilai crap and stuff..damn..ima gonna need to borrow Divyesh`s book to check that stuff out...so i sat with pei Ling,clarissa and marcus and stuff that day..and yes..we were dissing Wei Hong..marcus was complaining that he yaps and yaps non-stop during their BM tuition..hahaha..sigh...    anyway after tuition followed Valerie and Pearly (Ng..the smbb 1) to that smart connextion place..but decided not to enter so I left....val said she left smbb because of the same reason I left there..heh..and Pearly said she was still there cause she was 'strong'.heh.Met may yeng there as welll...and wei Ning,Wen-di and brendan b4...with them pretty much being part of the stella maris gang ppl I only know...    met err oh yeah Kishore or as I like to call him Kis-whore...haha...he said Shai`s the head prefect now..and he claimed that being a normal prefect itself was a headache...said they were able to talk him into the job.....and haha..Noorul is now a prefect...though hes a nice guy some ppl think hes a bit too much at times..heh...he was like doing a spot check the other day an Wei Han was like..no need to spot check me and stuff....so fine..but Noorul lied to wei Han claiming that teacher was calling him and then in the mean time he like spot checked his bag and stuff....and managed ti rampas a liquid paper...so wei han somehow found out abt this when he got back and went to Nooruls class and took all his books out of his bag and tore out every page from every book he had...heh....so all he could do was do his usuall stupid smile and stuff.....2 bad for him....    So like got home....wearing  stonewash jeans and a green  long sleeve t-shirt and my nikes but then..had to go out to 7eleven and guardian and stuff half an hour later...so I like left home wearing different clothes and like some ppl are bound 2 say/.."I say that guy half an hour ago I swear!".but now hes wearing different clothes.heh.Met Natalie and told her that.haha...    well lalala spent the night doing homework and working up on my   urlLink  livejournal   and stuff..which is still my second blog..but private..! yeah yeah later...       urlLink Blogspots  new features rule!
