Ack too nervous to eat, I went to the bus :-p.. praying for my life 'cause I was going to surrey :P. Anyways I bussed there everything went fine and I had a VERY good time [ i'm leaving this vague so I get the joy of questions from people who actually read my blog ]. I had to lie to get there but it was all good. Anyways :-p I had a good dinner and yeah here   I am now. Poo anywho this morning after I woke up the rain reminded me of a song. Haha I know it's corny and everything but when I was a little kid my mom used to always listen to amanda marshall, sheryl crow and stuff like that :p So anyways.. It reminded me of Amanda Marshall - Let it Rain. Haha so the songs been in my head all day. Anyways i'm gonna get back to chatting with all you people :-p... Ciao
