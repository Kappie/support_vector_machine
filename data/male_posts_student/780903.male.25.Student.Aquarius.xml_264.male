To the tune of "One More Night" by Phil Collins  "Red Mouse Nub"  It's been sitting there so long On the laptop Helps the arrow move around  But the glue has come unstuck The rubber's tearing Gets away and must be found  (chorus) I need a  Red Mouse Nub A brand new Red Mouse Nub Red Mouse Nub Oh I can't type without you (repeat)  It's been rolling 'cross the desk Have to find it Or the cursor will be stuck  (bridge) When I hit the keys It gets caught on my fingers And then I'm out of luck  (repeat chorus)
