I was just down in San Diego this weekend, and I went up to LA for the  LA County Museum of Art 's All Niter last night. It was cool I went up there with Naomi N. and Naomi R. for free art,  peanut butter , and for all the interesting LA people walking around this huge event. Tonight I'll be headed up to the  Autry Museum  for the  Wild in the Streets  exhibit and show. Channel 3, D.I., the Dickies and  TSOL  are playing, and there'll be other punk rock stuff going on too.   Speaking of punk... I was watching a show on VH1 for the 100 greatest hard rock bands and I find some questionable choices for the punk bands on there. Outside of the obvious big 3 (Ramones, Sex Pistols, and Clash), I think Fugazi is a good choice, but I don't know about the Misfits, and Rollins Band. There's also Iggy Pop and Bad Brains, which I think are alright.   Fugazi is sort of a the missing link between punk, alternative, indie, and emo. So I think that's a good rationale, but with the Misfits and Rollins I'm less sure about. For sure, without the Misfits there'd be no AFI and psychobilly would be very different if existent at all. However, I don't know about their overall impact on all of hard rock outside of a strain of punk. I really don't get having the Rollins Band, and not Black Flag. The other bands are reasonable too. However, I think bands like the Damned, and X are deserving of spots. Or even Bad Religion. I mean come on Hole and Ratt shouldn't really be on there. ***
