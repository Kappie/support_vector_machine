The cause of it was because my computer broke down for no reason whatsoever and I was unable to use it to communicate to the rest of the world via the Web. That's not all. My wallet and Nokia 3660 handphone was stolen while I went swimming in a public pool( luckily the thief was "kind" enough to leave my clothes behind, or else I would be going home in just my swimming trunks ). Goes to show how honest people are nowadays.   You may be thinking I am feeling terribly down now due to these turns in events. I indeed was, at least initially. I was even imagining myself strangling the thief if I ever got to get hold of him. But, strangely, I felt kinda HAPPY after sometime. Because, I know that whenever after something bad happens to me, something equally good, if not better, will happen to me as well(sounds like I am comforting myself). It may not be true, but it sure beats me sulking all day long.  Anyway, I just caught Spiderman 2 on the bigscreen recently. It sure was a great show. Besides the excellent CGI action, the script was also well-written with some twisted humour and thought-provoking quotes. My favourite one is the one about giving up things, even your dreams, for others in you believe in. On the whole, 5 thinbs up. Catch the show at a cinema near you!
