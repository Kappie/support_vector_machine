You snip away slowly, unknowingly tearing me apart. It's taken awhile but you are finaly reaching the end of the line. Snip by snip you barely cut through me, leaving a loveless residue on the poorly trimmed sides. I wish the scissors were sharper so they could slice right through without problem, leaving no trace of the offense. But no, your blades barely slide through me, and they leave the biggest pain of all.
