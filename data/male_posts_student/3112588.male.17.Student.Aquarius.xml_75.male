LoL! just one day i went without typing anything....oh well--i've moved on! sunday wasn't that much fun: church in the morning (like 5 ppl in SBC-everyone's in yosemite), came home for a bit, went to the country club to visit the g-parents, then came home and chatted with my aunt for like 5 hours! dude, i love her..she's such a cool aunt! then, went to the store, and of all ppl to run into, i see TRIKA D'COSTA! its been like 2 1/2 years since we last got together--im sure that elizabeth hasn't forgotten all those parties with all those "dances", have you liz? so anywayz--she totally blew me off, and so did her mom, who SAID she like loved me...but im good! it was just weird seeing them since its been a few years! at first, i was like: mom, go this way!!!! but we made eye contact, and it was weird.....oh well--then i came home and just chilled by myself for a while. tim called me around like 11:45pm i guess?! and we talked until about 3 or so. so funny how a week ago at that EXACT time his car was totally broken down, and we stayed up all night talking...good convo last night though: "dude, if our parents were dead, we would have SO much fun!" LoL!! omg, that was soo terrible, but so funny. so we talked, then we hung up with one another...i ate hecka ice cream and junk food, watched "Lunch with Europe", which is a European Economics show for a bit--then went to bed around 4:15 am. woke up early today and just kinda chilled...thats all i've been doing today pretty much, but hopefully i'll get to see tim this week or something--praying for your car to be cheap and get done fast! soooo im gonna go right now...gonna watch 50 First Dates tonight, so i hope its good! bye
