The real difference between that album and U2's  All That You Can't Leave Behind , which I compared it to, is that U2's album has "Beautiful Day," a truly great song.  There's no stand-out track on the Beasties album.  Nothing that grabs me or jumps out at me.  Also, the more I listen to the album, the more the lyrics to "Right Right Now Now" kind of bother me.  I agree with most of the sentiments, but there's something too facile about the lyrics.  They lack bite or edge or something that would make them stand out.
