Back to the present. This is almost as bad of a ride as the first. There is absolutely no room in this car. Im going to sleep.  We got to grandmas before lunch, yawn, and theres about as much to do here as there is in the car. but later we might get to drive the golfcart.  We went to the pool. kinda boring. Rick was checkin out all the minors, kinda funny. no one was hot. except these 2 girls, completely out of my league tho so i left them alon. Someone did, however, think Patrick was "cute". lol.  Yeah we got to drive the golfcart, but not for too long. I cant wait till tomorrow.
