There are no classes right now yet there are still quite a few people here.  Of the people here probably 90% of them are indian (or asian at least).  Of this 90% at least 80% of them stink.  I don't mean stink as in a sweaty smell ... I mean stink and in they havent had a bath in several days and are usuing perfume to cover it up!!  It's very bad and if you think I am exaggerating you should walk through the lab here and see for yourself.  At times it is all I can do to keep from gagging.
