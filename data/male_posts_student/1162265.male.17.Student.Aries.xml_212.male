Magic crap is generally BS, and even if it existed, I don't see much of a reason to pursue anything that leads to external power, when I can't even understand my own mind yet.  So you know.  I figure, I'll just work on my dreams, and psyche all the stuff that's important.  If I can understand that, what the hell can't I understand.  I started my dream journal.  Cleared out my closet, to give myself some freespace.  Then I updated my other writtings.  I'm thinking, maybe I can change my other story.  I forget the name.  But it really had a lot of potential if it was more grounded in reality.
