Then, at the end of the e-mail there is some bullsh*t, similair to this "send this to 10 of your friends, or you will have a terrible death, you will die of cancer, in great pain and agony, however, if u send it on, you will have great success in your love life!"  Wow, u guys must have loads of time if u think this is fun. "Lets go screw some one's day up by sending them 20 dumb emails!", you know what? I'm gonna take my revenge on all of you idiots, and publish your e-mail addresses, I'm sorry for the innocent ones. Anyway, here goes the list!  urlLink CLICK!   By the way, you guys have to realise that I'm being nice to you, because I could sell these email addresses off, instead Im gonna publish them for free. :)
