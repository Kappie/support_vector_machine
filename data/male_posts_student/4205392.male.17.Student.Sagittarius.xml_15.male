As I write this, I'm trying to wipe the peach juice on this page that appeared subsequent to the smashing of the aforementioned peaches which were placed (unbeknownst to me) in my carry-on by my parents. Typical. On the flight, I learned a little bit about curry, Yellowstone, and the deliciousness of Coca-Cola. Here we go! Prepare yourself Daryl McBride, Orrin Hatch, and [Supreme Overlord of the Mormons]. Daniel Chen has arrived in Utah!
