-when you have a choice between going camping with your family and going to rachael's house, you should probly pick your family but it sucks

-richville is a lonely place to live

-i miss my friends

-summer should be twice as long as it is

-most guys write really short e-mails and i dont like it

-Nicole still isn't part of this blog

love you all, hope you had fun at rachael's
