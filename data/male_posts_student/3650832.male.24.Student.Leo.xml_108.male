(Yeah, I could run it around in the head for a while and find some b.s. thinking man's extrapolated jargon filled meandering, but even that seems a bit weak.) As a real person, he only affirms the greatness of the ancient Greek civilization being that no one socked him once or twice, at least not until high tea. Anyways, more later. Take care, Josh.
