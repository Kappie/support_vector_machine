This segment is basically to be dedicated to a random quote, thought, etc, that I had or heard - if you hear any others, please let me know!     Todays random statement of the day (I said it at a party on Saturday, when a mate was looking for something sharp to open a can of beer)  "That's a kindergarten next door...there's gotta be razor wire there!"  And another:  "You're the one-man cool patrol" (used as an effective insult, not a compliment, by the way)
