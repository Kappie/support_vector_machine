One of the students spoke up and said that he didn't know about the quiz. The teacher said that it was on the schedule that was handed out to everyone in a previous class. The student said he didn't know that (and very obviously implied that other people didn't either) so nothing could be done and there shouldn't be a quiz.  I was flabbergasted. How is it that a student can tell the teacher what is acceptable in the teacher's class? I couldn't believe the audacity of this guy. He showed absolutely no respect whatsover for this Professor!  Since all this happened in Japanese, there are certain nuances that just don't get translated, but what this guy said and how he said it is like an American saying, "What the fuck? How the hell can we have a quiz? Some of us didn't know about it so it's really pointless to have one." The exact phrase he used, "Shigata ga nai" implies a sense of the decision having already been made and there's nothing [the teacher] could do about it.  That really pissed me off. This guy was trying to bully the professor into not giving us the quiz simply because he didn't want to take responsibility for the fact that he didn't check the schedule beforehand and prepare for class.   Glad nobody checked my blood pressure that day, otherwise I would have been hospitalized.  Now, before any of you people try to assume that I'm a teacher's pet let's get one thing straight. I'm not. In fact I really disliked this teacher, however that is no excuse to disrespect his/her position and the authority he/she holds.  It's time to wake up people. Don't be such a wuss, stand up and just accept the fact you might have made a mistake.  Revolutions of the Mind
