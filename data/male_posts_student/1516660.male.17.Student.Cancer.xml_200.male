I have been waiting for this day for so long! Oh god! JingJing can finally be with XiaoXin! Second piece of good news, SiTing finally ackowledged WanWan as "Mum"! So touching!! The most exciting part is, who WanWan chooses! The lucky cat is....Yang Xiong!! YAY!!! I always wanted them to be together! My predictions came true! YaY. Ya know, ever since NuoWen left for Australia, I pretty much ruled him out off the picture. YX contributed so much to the family...He deserves to be recongized for his efforts.  Oh...today I went to watch a movie. Rugrats Go Wild to be exact. It was an okay movie, quite humourous too! I watched it with XC and HuiMin. Hmm, the rest of the time, we went around Causeway Point shopping for Christmas presents. We paid a little visit to Amanda in the ladies' department in Metro. I gave her quite a scare, hehehe. We also visited Wendy in the Christmas decor department. Heh. I never knew they have to carry around batteries. Coolies! I got a few ideas what to buy le for who le.  Hmm....what else happened today ar? Ahh...yes. I chose my JCs. My top 3 choices are: AJ Science, PJ Science and YJ Science. Hmm.... Excellent choices. Yeah. No regrets la. Cannot regret anymore. Form sent in.  Hmm...you know what? I am going off le. Gonna watch Survivor later. So, see ya tomorrow. Night blog!
