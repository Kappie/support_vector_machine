Ok so there was a spider in my house and my mom was about to kill it, but I stopped her because I don't like to kill bugs [they haven't done anything to me] so anyway she told me to get it out of her house then. So I took a piece of the newspaper from that morning and tried to get it on the piece of paper, but it just kept running away from it and then [like magic] I saw the spider turn into a cat. It was really crazy. So I kept the cat as my own and it's really cool. I hope it doesn't turn into a bear, cause then I'll be attacked in my dreams. ooo Freddy Kruger. yikes. Well yeah that was just really weird so i thought I should tell someone. Wow my brain is really starting to get all screwed up again.    I love you
