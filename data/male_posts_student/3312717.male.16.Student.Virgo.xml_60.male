Got to witness Chris try to hold his own while talking to Hanna and Kaly and some other former seniors. Quite funny with Chris yelling "Fuck you guys" and then Hanna just saying "He's from Pequot."  I've also decided my room needs some new wall furnishings. This redecoration process shall first begin with extensive research and then will end in a great ordering frenzy, probably on monday.
