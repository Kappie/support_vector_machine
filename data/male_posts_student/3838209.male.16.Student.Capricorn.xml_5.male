The morning was rather wasted as Jon, Angie and I ended up going from place to place, only to realise that all the shops we were looking for were closed. We were quite BoLiao, as in, we ended up riding from Bishan to TP and back to Bishan. Other than a movie, nothing else was really accomplished(except maybe planning for Choir Outing). Speaking of accomplishments, sigh..there was just so much i could have accomplished during the holidays, but never did. I realised long ago there was no point looking forward to the end of Exams, as after that normal lessons resume and i'd end up dragging myself home at 8 plus again!!! Maybe its time i start planning my aims for the 2nd half of the year. I certainly hope i accomplish it this time.   Top 5 acadamic aims i wanna achieve from now  - Get my PW work spiffed up. I can't believe i put this off during the entire hols!!! Lazy me!!!! - Collect relevant PEARLS Points. I seriously hate the PEARLS system! Yet i have no choice but to submit to it... - Improve my Chinese. The Senior Minister once said that not everyone is cut out to be billingual. I'm gonna prove him wrong! - Improve my GP. Darn, i still can't get over the fact i screwed up my midyrs for GP!!! - Finish all my tutorials on time.(still got 1 Roots and 1 Vectors qn unsolved)    Top 5 personal aims i wanna achieve from now  - Lose weight. I think i'm getting fat, i seriously need to start working out. - Train my vocal range. I've yet to hit the high G. If i can't make it, i'm gonna be a screeching banshee when i do tenor. - To be on time. Could somebody tell me how many times i've been late already???? - Improve my piano and guitar. I still suck at sightreading, and my guitar pieces still sound horrible on recording. - Get Shao Wei (My student) to score 1 for his AMaths. If he does, i might get promoted.
