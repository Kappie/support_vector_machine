Fireworks go on today, and I wanted to get a shot to go, and I passed up on it cause I wasnt feeling up for it. I regret it now, because I need something to pick up this feeling of depressedness I suddenly have.  Been trying to keep optimistic, and I've been planning to go somewhere tomorrow, hang out with a couple friends. Really hoping I get to go.   Anyways, just thought I'd say that, cuz, yaknow, just wanted to.   See you people later.
