Now the Department of Fatherland er, uh, Homeland Security is telling us that we're under an Orange Alert. An attack could come from from the air (any number of terrorist branches could be harboring "ready to drop" oranges) or by sea (in the case of navel oranges).   All I can think to say right now is, "I told you so." The next revelation of doom will likely come from those pesky vegetables everyone tells me I should be eating. Don't say I didn't warn you.  Be careful out there.
