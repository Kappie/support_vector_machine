I've no idea whether you read it or not, and I'm not going to go, "Have you read it?" from msn. But do tell me, when you read about it. I still love you, as who you are. Keep on rocking. =P Don't misunderstand what I said before that, 'cause I seriously have  no  offence. =P *Actually, I spotted a slight change from you, or maybe it's me* Meh, tats.
