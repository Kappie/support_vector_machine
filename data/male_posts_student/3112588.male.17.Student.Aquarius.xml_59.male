LoL!! i guess i did OK, well at least thats what THEY told me haha. i think that instead of going back to bible study (as much as i do enjoy it), its time to move on and maybe just start going to softball instead. the nice thing is, there's only 2 more weeks of bible study, so even if i HAD to choose--i woudlnt really have to, b/c softball would be the only option...hope that made sense, but im really tired. i just fell asleep on my bed last night, when i was supposed to be doing something else..i just passed out from playing baseball, and my brain is totally fried. i have "Junior-itis" as they call it...this phrase basically means that you can think NO longer, and you need to just shut-down...great, this has to happen before finals, right? ahhhh!! im gonna go insane! i have so much hw to do tonight..the only good thing about this situation is that i dont start school until 10 am tomorrow (seniors are taking finals early), but even that has a downside, b/c i have to spend half of the extra time i would use to sleep, to be doing American Lit/Us History/Marketing/Math etc etc etc....my english group is making me really mad. we have to do a 15 min presentation on the 1940's, but the hard things is, my teacher said: you cant do anything on the war--so now im stuck, b/c we can only do 1945-1949, and we have to include: Science, History, Arts, Technological Advances, Entertainment, etc....half my group basically bailed, and i didnt feel like being a control freak on wednesday..i only wound up yelling at 3 ppl. im sure that half the ppl in my American Lit class prob hate me, b/c im always yelling. but, what else am i supposed to do?? i like things done, and done RIGHT...maybe its not like this @ home, but at school (especially a class where i need to keep my A+), its VERY important to me. my teacher expects me to provide TOTALLY ABOVE AVERAGE work...more so than the other students. i hate taking charge all the time, but if i have to do it, then i will, ya know? well, i better start writing my 5 pg essay (for US History) on how Iraq is more like: Vietnam or WW2..and use a bibliography as well, which is no good--basically b/c i got all my info from Dan Scott LoL!! btw, thanx Daniel for helping me out....ok, only 1 more REAL day of school...then 3 days of finals. i dunno what im gonna do this weekend (other than studying)...its nicole's b-day, i so better get her some flowers or something....(sigh) better get going byebye guys/girls
