I think I'm really starting to feel the pressure of the test coming up, but i think as long as we continue to have review after school, I'll survive. I will definitely be at school on Sunday from 1-4, but what are we working on? I think the era that i need to work on the most is during the 1800s...pretty much the entire century has become a blur to me. But im feeling confindent about the 1600s and definitely the 1900s, and im starting to understand the 1700s better as we've been talking about it during the review sessions. See you all tomorrow! Oh yeah, and Rob, dont ditch me on Friday morning...i coming to your house at the crack of dawn whether or not youre awake!  Kailie
