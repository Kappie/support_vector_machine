I've got a large collection of Les Mis stuff which is now residing on my wall... it needs to be seen to be believed I think but it's pretty impressive I think. Or not, you know, at the moment I couldn't care less.  I don't think I'm in a particularly bad mood, I'm just not in a good one. Confusion once again plagues my head, my brain spins out of control once more... perhaps an overly romantic description but it's how I feel. My thoughts fly apart.  Let's be blatant, I've been thinking about Lawa a lot recently, but I've also today been thinking a lot about Beccy. It's not a different obsession, I promise. What it is is that I feel very confused about what was a pretty massive difference from how we reacted first time we met. First time, she was a little disinterested, she talked to all the adults while I was kinda set apart. On Saturday we talked a lot and she was sitting on my lap, playing with my jumper and putting her arms around my neck. I don't know. People change, and she was different from how I remembered her. But am I so different now as well?  I suppose if I had to select a current mood, it would be a mixture of bemused, confused, and worried.  Love, Jon Roskilly
