He said he thought maybe he was combining "stupid" and "horrible."  That reminds me of when Strong Bad came up with "Dumples" for CGNU's team masking, thinking he might've meant "Dumplings," but he was really hungry at the time.  Read below for a recent post.  Oh, btw, here's another Loren quote from today:  "No! Mine's stiffer!"
