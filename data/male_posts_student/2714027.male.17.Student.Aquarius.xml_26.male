I nearly drove in front of a bus, but otherwise I learnt a lot. There was more to take onboard this time round, as we did several circuits of the village, even going up into 4th at 60mph down the by-pass (wow!). It got a little scary at some points, but I'm gradually learning to do some things without thinking about them. Next lesson is on Monday and then I've got one of Wednesday after that.  A couple of hours ago I went into town to set up a bank account for my gap savings. Ironically, you have to prove your identity via post or at the branch for an internet based account. I also picked up a nice new wallet to replace my old crappy Kangol one. While I was in town, I thought I'd pop into HMV and I had a brief look at the videogames...   £39.99!   How much?!? People in GAME were queuing up to pay hideous amounts for what were mostly crap games. Gulliblee sheep, the poor things. Buy games online at Amazon and you pay £10 less than in GAME. Plus you spend nothing on travel costs, you save time and you can compare prices instantly. Amazon practically offer a 'buy 3, get one free' offer if you add up the savings based on the price alone. When there are more people buying games online than in shops, it'll be a very interesting time for high street retailers, that's for sure.
