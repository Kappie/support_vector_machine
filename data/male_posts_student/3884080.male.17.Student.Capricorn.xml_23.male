I called into work this morning and told my boss that i was sick and i couldnt work my 5-8 shift (but im not really sick, i just dont want to go) and i think she could tell that i was faking because she said "get a doctors excuse" and then she slammed down the phone. But i dont care im not going to work today, last night i worked 5pm to 1:27am. I was very pissed about that so today im like screw it im not going to work today. so im not going to.  nothing to post about, so im out
