I must say, I was a bit doutfull when I first heard about Atlantis but the pilot episode last night just shattered those doubts. Its really hard to explain why it's so great. Just think of what makes SG-1 great and then think new galaxy and you'll probably have it. Anyway I recommend that anybody who is a fan of the Stargate franchise an just scifi (and action fans) go and check it out. Enjoy!
