Suppose to meet my friend, Ben to go SIM together, ended up i asked the cab driver to go dover mrt to pick him up. When i reach SIM and found the crowd, i met up with my other friend, Gina.. And i turned my head, and saw the officer who was once my PC in camp. OMG! Was damn surprised, talked to him for a while and went back to my friends.  And i wrote my name on the list for my bachelor programme, i asked the student union guy wat will the programme be like, and he said that they will bring us to the track at ngee ann poly.. And i felt cheated! HAR! Ask me come here play game AR! My friend, Gina, used her charm to charm a guy into telling us details of the whole programme! HAHA, the guy told us that we can skip the bloody games and come back at 3pm to collect course materials. Ended up we went to Mac at clementi for breakfast, ben went back home to sleep and asked me to collect the materials for him, coz he damn tired and needs to go back camp later on...   Oh well, so i "nuah" together with gina and went down queensway shopping centre, she bought a bag and i was damn tempted, especially when the salesperson told us theres a compartment for laptop.. He asked gina to carry the bag and he pulled the bag down.. And gina dun feel the heaviness at all! DAMN! Who will be my genie and give me money for the bag! haha.   After nuah-ing till 3pm, went down to SIM again... Saw everybody holding on to course materials and we dont know where to get it.. So i asked a student union person, i told her: Sorry we couldnt make it in the morning, so we just came.. May i know where to get course materials? (Haha, or should i tell her about our stint in Macdonalds, Queensway and Ikea?).. So went up to collect our course materials, and to my disgust, i only can collect them when i paid for my course fees. OMG! And i only rec the letter three days ago! DAMN IT, one whole day wasted!   Oh well, so Gina got to wait for her bf to pick her up to go to some concert, as a samaritan, i accompanied her.. Went to coffee bean at Holland V to nuah and wait.. And got to know some sad news (read my prev posting for more info), sad man.  Listened to the cd i bought not long ago on my bus journey home... Damn hooked on it, haha...     LOVE TIS CD!  After that, i went home and my nephew  niece are there! Haha, had fun disturbing my nephew, and i used a piece of candy to make him call me uncle, haha so cute... And i chased him around the house, haha...   Got to settle all my course fees tomolo, wake up early again! ARGH!! DAMN!!
