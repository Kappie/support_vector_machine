It started out with my friend and I at a busy intersection, on our bikes. I got this feeling that we were at the other end of the city, but the intersection looked exactly like one in this side. So we were trying to cross the intersection to get on a bus. When we get across, a bus pulls up. We try to get on, but the driver says something like "This is a ride only bus" and we get off. Then I noticed my grandparents across the intersection. I get over there and start talking to them. I think they were looking for directions. Also, there was a bridge just after the intersection, with a highway under it. So I take them over the bridge and start pointing them the way. At the other end of the bridge, it got all wooded. My grandfather stays put while I took my grandmother into the forested area. Apparently there were two very narrow and rusted railroad tracks surround by wall, which was then covered in vines. After a short walk there was a dirt hill, which we climbed. Beside it there was a go cart track and in front was the highway. I pointed the way a bit more, then it repeated but only started at the point where we were walking down the railroad tracks.   I was at my old school and I walked to where there are a few playing fields, but in the middle it looked like there was somewhat of a bus station. Even though it was crowded, I managed to meet some of my friends. The weird part was that my "friends" were Hige, Tsume, Toboe and Kiba. So at first I met up with Toboe and we talked a bit. I forgot to mention that at this station there was a raised platform, which I was on while kneeling to talk to Toboe (who was on the lower platform). So after some talking, Toboe noticed that the guy beside him was stole some of his (Toboe's) stuff, so Toboe stole it back while the thief wasn't looking and stole a bit of the thief's stuff, including an iPod. I asked to see it and he showed it to me. It looked exactly like the normal iPod, but it was slightly bigger and had more buttons. As I looked up, I saw Hige on another bus and I waved to him and he waved back. Then our bus came, Toboe and I got on but since it was so packed we had to stand near the door. As the bus rounded the corner to get out, my old Art/History/Geography teacher, Ms. Millard came on the bus by our doors. She was pretty pissed and demanded to know who caved the at the dance (I didn't know anything since I don't go to that school anymore). We got off at what seemed to be the same place and met up with Kiba and Tsume. While walking amongst the fields, we noticed some people playing catch in a baseball field and decided to join in. Kiba, on the other hand, decided to sit out and hang out with some girls who were playing gameboy. So it was just Toboe, Tsume and I playing catch with other people. After a bit we went to sit down with Kiba and watch everyone else play catch. Then this other girl walked in and Tsume wouldn't stop whining (in the "she's so hot" sense). Then I went to my grandparents house (which in essence, was exactly the same as mine, furniture and all) to introduce me to his new dogs. It turned out that his new dogs were Toboe, Tsume, Hige and Kiba but in their wolf/dog form, yet I was the only one who could see them in their human form (out of my grandparents and parents). They were all sitting under the kitchen table (except Kiba, who was somewhere else). I mouthed asking where Kiba was (since I didn't want to grandfather and father to hear me) and Tsume mouthed back that he was upstairs in the master bedroom. So I went up there and saw him playing gameboy beside the bed. I walked over, sat down beside him and watched him play. I have to admit, he was pretty good. When he got a game over, we flopped onto the bed where Toboe decided to join us. Then I woke up.   I was at my old school again, but this time I was walking around inside with my other friend. Apparently the school was having a bit of a flooding problem (this was probably linked to the main water pipe breaking at the start of last years school year). So we were walking around in shin deep water and decided to make our way to the school's office. When we got there, it was hectic as usual but one of the secretaries lead us to the phone. Instead of it being at the front, as it usually was/is, she lead us down a hall. When I got on the phone, I called my dad and asked him to come pick us up. He said he would. So we waited around in the office for my dad to come. It only took a few minutes for him to come. Then the dream skipped ahead to where my friend and I were at a construction area at night. We wandered around, came up to a small forest, walked through it and came back to the school.   My family and I (excluding my older brother) drove down to a mall. We parked in a parking garage and went to the mall. We stayed there for most of the day, until it got dark. After dark, we went looking for our car, but we just got lost among the endless amounts of dark, empty car lots. Every once in a while we came across a lot that was filled with a whole bunch of people, where we got the impression that they were either stoned or drunk or both. In the end, I got bored of the dream, never found the car and decided to wake up.   I decided to take the day off from school and hang around the house with my mom. After a bit of watching TV my mom had to go out and run some errands and I stayed home. While my mom was out, I got a phone call from my friend, who was talking about something with airports and busses. So I got on the bus and met him near the airport, where we then transferred to a bus to get home. When we got on I noticed the transfer the driver gave to us was printed on that light pink and blue paper, like the tickets AMC theaters give you and that the ticket itself was provided by AMC. So we're riding the bus until it hits a flooded part of the road (probably relating to the flooding in Peterborough). The driver decides to drive through it, so I find myself standing through the bus's sunroof. After a few minutes of ploughing though, we get out and it continues it's course. Eventually I make myself home. When I got home, my mom asked where I was and by then I woke up.
