I had jazz band this morning... and i totally slept through my alarm so i was late... but mr caroll didn't care, he needs all the trombones he can get :P  And then school started and we're doing poetry in English and its totally cool except that the things where we're supposed to write poems its write it like so and so would not write it like you would, so I decided not to to the poem for today.  Bio was interesting, me and mr g laughed about a few things, and we got new seats, and I like mine better than the last, but mr G wouldn't let reid sit behind me :(  Oh and did I mention that this chapter is really boring?  ah but it wasn't bad.  And eash wasn't so fun, and study hall was really boring but I finnished my bio packet so I have nothing for assignments in that class until wednesday.  Electronics is gonna be a really really easy class I can see, the whole class is stupid practacly, but the teacher seems really leaniant.  Lunch is when the day started to get better again, I sat by jeremy and kelsi and jenna and people here actually talk... lol and everyone brings their stuff with them... nobody did that at 4th hour except like thea and eliz.  I must say, 6th hour is better than 4th :P  lets see 7th hour ohhh my he was pissed again... theres like 2wice as many people in that class now too.  german was good, we got new seats there too, and i'm like way in the back of the room, which is good, i think.  Band was ok, not the best though.  Well I wrote the new poem, and procrastinated on homework, so i'm kinda mad at that right now, and then i went to opendiary and became sad.  It seems laura noticed just about everyone who came to 6th hour lunch except me... that kind of thing never makes you feel very good.  I guess people just consider me a low maintenance friend... but its terrible being a low maintenance friend, i don't want to be one, I don't want to be the "if nobody else is around" guy.  People can be so mean sometimes... it makes me quite sad... I'm not talking about Laura... I think you know who you are... and what i'm talking about... grrrrr.  It's nobody's place to decide other's people's lives.  Sorry for being blunt, but I'm just getting tired of it all.  Anyway I'm listening to my thinking music now and that always cheers me up so I'm doing better now.  Well, it's 7:30 i should finnish my hausaufgaben (and homework)... lol
