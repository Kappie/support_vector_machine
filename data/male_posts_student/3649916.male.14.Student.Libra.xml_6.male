I sold many bulk order deeds for blacksmiths and tailors.  I have become the ultimate thief, and everyone thinks i suck.  Today has not been busy at all, I stole a few rings to piss people off for my pleasure, not very good ones but yet...still rings.  I went on my other character too and fought some mythical monsters called imps.  I am growing plants in the game also.  It will be interesting when they are finally finished.  I hope that later today the world gets busier, i am playing on a freeshard at the time and probably some time....someday i will move to pay to play ultima online, where the masters are!  It is almost the end of school and I cannot wait.  Its also kind of shitty because I will not see my friends or others for like 2 months because they are out busy doing things.  Also the one girl I ever liked is moving away, which is amazingly shitty.  Her name is Gillian, I am just adding this in for when i am in future and i look back at this hehe.  Exams in 3 days.  Cannot wait for the end.  The events of today were pretty bleak, nothing at all happened i was pretty moody today, dont know why but i was because of some other kids irritating me.
