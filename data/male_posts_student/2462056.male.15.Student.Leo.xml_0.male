I'm still working on putting all of my CDs on it, only about 20 more to go.  Claire came back from camp. Hehe it wasn't soccer camp like I thought, it was band camp.  Whoops!  Yeah, and Chrissy had a birthday/going away party, so that was pretty fun, because everyone was hyper it seemed.  On Sunday I went to the skatepark with Jesse for the first time in forever, because he wanted to try out some of the stuff taht he learned at Woodward.  We got down there and Ben showed up.  We were about to start riding when a storm rolled in like, instantly.  We sat underneath a ramp and we were going to wait it out but then like, we saw some lightning stike like, crazy close, so we took off quick.  Jesse and I went to his house and watched TV and played PS2 and stuff for a while, then I went back home.  Tyler (my cousin) came over that night and ate dinner with us.  That night Claire came over and we watched Gothika.  That movie is freaky as crap.  Especially the 2nd half because i was sitting in the dark downstairs watching it alone, haha.  Yesterday I sat around the house for a long time, until that night around 7 when I went to Zach's with some people.  We played Xbox and Gamecube for like, 4 hours, and it was fun.  Yep that's pretty much all that has happened lately....
