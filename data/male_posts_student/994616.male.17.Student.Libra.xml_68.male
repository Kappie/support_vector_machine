I'd give this song about 4 stars out of 5 it rocks!  it has the  trippiest  video-clip using superimposing, blue-screens and what not! And there is so much green, so very very green. The only problem is that there aren't any specific lines i can quote of sing, - though i suppose thats  good thing for the people who hang around wit me.    Don't read this:  First some background on the two competing media types. All the new PC  music download  programs use  WMA  (windows media audio). This is a propriety Microsoft format, which means that every song sold makes money for Microsoft. Apple uses  AAC  (advanced audio codec) in their iTunes Music Store. This was developed by Dolby and is an open format (no one makes money from the sales).   The iPod, which has over 50% of the mp3 player market, doesn't support  WMA. Apple is launching the iTunes Music Store (iTMS) for windows. If Apple makes a huge enough marketing push they should be able to get an even more massive chunk of the mp3 player market, and while doing this if they choose not to support WMA then anyone who owns / buys an iPod will be forced to use the iTMS thereby  ensuring the success of the iTMS . However this would perpetuate the idea that apple computers don't work well with non apple products.  The other option is to make the iPod play WMA which would give the iPod an even larger  market share in the mp3 player market.  This would probably be the better option because apple makes more money from the iPod than they would from the iTMS and it would make apple appear more user friendly.    ok you can start reading again   1 up shroom to: Apple - having the (voted) #1 coolest product - the iPod  Poisoned Shroom to: King Lear
