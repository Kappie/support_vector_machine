As usual, talking as much nonsense and feeding as much vital information as possible. Taking each other back to the track on where we started. Really miss her pressence, now that she's back. I need to mend things up with her. Got myself two beautiful books. 1 entitled World's worst murder and another with world's unsolved mysteries. Such interesting books Gonna start reading it to the end. It's rejoiceful now cause not only that I've gotten back my long time bestfriend, i've also complete the most sickerning homework of all time, Maths.
