As you know last saturday my family went off on holiday somewhere, dunno where, dont really care but anyways, lets go through each day;  Saturday : Got newspapers, went on computer talked to my wonderful freinds online. Sunday : Pretty much the same, were gonna go to town with Jonny, Sarah and Vix :-( . Monday : Aha! Finally socialising, bit of gaming and watching of dvds while rock music ripped through the tv speakers, spent good part of the day hugging vix on the sofa. Tuesday : Four of us go to town, look around, sit on a bench, more vix cradling and stuff, my quest to find a pirate flag also failed :'( oh well...  So that was the week, monday and tuesday have tired me out, i've experienced alot of emotional changes over the four days in total, i was angry and scared saturday and sunday, calm and worried on monday and very relaxed tuesday.  I'm happy at the moment but also in a wierd dreamy state, something wonderful happened to me and others around me are happy too. I also feel loved, by the girl I love the most.
