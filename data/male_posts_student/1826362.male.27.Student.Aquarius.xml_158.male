And it has what appeares to be dope in it.  I squat down to see what it really is, and pick it up, and it sure looks like dope, or some other green leafy substance.  and then I think, whatever it is, I really don't want ot get involved, so I just put it back where I found it, and when I came home later on, it was gone.
