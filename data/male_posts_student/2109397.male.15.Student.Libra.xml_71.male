FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK. OK I'm done wiht the fucks, I could have done more, but Fletcher Memorial Home is keeping me in tune. Good song it is. BUt you know what song is a bad song? Fucking Limp Bizkit's gay fucking ass cover of  The Who's  Behind Blue Eyes. FUCK. I just compared the two side by side, and it made me almost have a seisure...literally. Limp Bizkit is SHIT...FUCKING SHIT. I'm not one to hate on people's taste in music but if you consider that nasty white trash piece of shit (Fred Durst), and his band "music" you're a fucking looney tone-deaf idiot. I trully mean this, if you like Limp Bizkit in any shape or form I HATE YOU and will never be your friend or aquaintance or anything. Exceptions going to Peden and Samo, because they are special cases, and they were misguided. Very misguided. I warn anyone who hasn't heard either version of this song, to listen to the original FIRST. There will be no turning back. If you do however like Limp's version better, I wish you no good luck ever in life and hope you parish in a horribly painful death. I'm glad I know and understand the music hierarchy unlike stupid people these days who catch on to every single fucking punk-pop-rock-emo shit band that comes out every fucking week. Now there's a few who have the right thing going down, but a lot of them are just re-using music and lyrics, ideas, and inspirations. Music is about expressing yourself not others. That is what a lot of these little bands have fogged in their poor misguided minds. Certain people liten to music from the 70s an 80s and even teh 90s and say oh this sucks, I don't want to listen to oldies. FUCK THAT, seriously you must have no musical sensor in your fucking body. Classic rock is just that, classic. It is the original, it started all of this stuff. But back then it had a meaning. Today's little bands only point in life is to get on MTV and TRL. I pause here to say, in the voice of Ms. Booshay " MTV IS THE DEVIL!" MTV is probably the stupidest thing that has ever happened to music. Video killed the radio star. UH HUH it actually meant something! Video's in my opinion ruin the songs, they can make them brilliant, but really, they can change the meaning of songs for people, and that in my opinion is just fucking wrong. Maybe you are a fan of TRL where you get to see like 30 seconds of each video. It's like those little hit clip shit fucks. Who the hell gets entertainment out of those? Well its the same as you people who watch fucking TRL god damnit. I think sometime in the near future I will post a list of all the bands who have, in my mind, sinned the art that is music.  Thank you, and goodbye.
