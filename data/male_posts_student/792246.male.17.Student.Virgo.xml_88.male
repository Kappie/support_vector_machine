Obviously she can't be in two places at once, meaning I can be here in the library and procrastinate.  Amy doesn't want to be here, she wants to go to sleep. She seems impressed that I can type without looking at the monitor or the keyboard, so I'm scaring her by looking directly at her while typing.  There are seniors here on Senior Cut Day. I hate them. I also hate the juniors who are planning this Junior Cut Day, they're stupid.  Happy Birthday Mom! However I hope to god you can't read this site.
