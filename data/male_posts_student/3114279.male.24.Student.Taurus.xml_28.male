      I finally got something done. I got quite a few things packed and a lot of stuff thrown out.  I also found my  urlLink CQ  DVD, which I thought was long gone, in my trunk.  Now I'm relaxing and doing some around the house type stuff before tonight's bowling.  Went out to lunch with Ryan and Glenn, and ran into an ex, which I was afraid of, but it turned out to be not strange, as I thought it might.  One more week...
