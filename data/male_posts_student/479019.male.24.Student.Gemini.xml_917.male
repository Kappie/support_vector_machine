If anything I apologize for trying to wake you up, when I was bored in the morning. I should know by now how you get when you’re tired and want to sleep. However, a lot of the other stuff you started, regardless if you knew what you were doing. This is not the first time you’ve done something like this. You weren’t the only one that got irritated and felt weird.
