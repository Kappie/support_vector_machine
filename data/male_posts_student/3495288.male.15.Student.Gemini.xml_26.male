I did not go to school because i am now not feeling very well. A bad flu, Fever and Headache. Nope i did not visit the doctor. My mother asked me to rest in bed and eat this weird pills. Haiz. Woke up as if an elephant is sitting on me. My headfelt heavylike a rock. I miss school. I miss everyone in my class, except Bing Lin. This is all for now. Yeah short msg for today as nothing much is happening other then me being able to burn the kitchen down, clean my room, laze around and sleep. Thats all for now. Take care all. Bubbye.
