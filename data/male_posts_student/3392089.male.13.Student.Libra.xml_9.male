And to tell you the truth I would even jump in front of a bullet to save you even if that caused me to dye it was worth.  You have been the best girlfriend I have ever had.  I think our relationship will never split and I'm so glad because I love you too much.  And I had people say why do you go out with a fat girl and you no what I'd say.  "Well goddamnit I'm proud of her!"  It takes a strong person to live through the things we've been through.  And you think I really care what people think about your wait a lets see...NO!  The only thing I care about is that you stay the way you are and keep your heart pure of love and passion and don't let an asshole like Robert Trahan get in the way of YOUR life.  You have no Idea how proud I am to have you as my girlfriend.  In fact,the only time I care about your weight is when it involves your feelings or health that's all that matters to me.  I really don't know how I would get through my life without you.  So Dear Rachel I love you.  And always will!! -iBrad
