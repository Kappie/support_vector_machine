I actually liked it, the whole picking clothes and fitting them. Useally I'm half sleeping/ half braindead when I've to fit something. I got some really nice clothes. Hope I'll like them tomorrow. I useally regret buying clothes after a while. I fixed my website a bit. Made a test at school. Tried to play the piano again. I found out the sheet music I used isn't right. It just doesn't sound right. No, it's not me! I'll pursue this hobby I think. It's not like I'm going to be real busy the upcoming holiday. I'm going to try to improve myself yet again. This sounds a bit weird maybe. But that's just a thing I have. I'm always trying to improve myself. Then I'll try to change my character, my appearance, my way of thinking or whatever. I fixed a lot about myself this way. Before I used to be a really shy kid with absolutely no social skills and no idea of reality. Last Christmas I volunteered (somebody had to do it, so it might as well be me) to say something about charity and stuff at my school in front of 90 people. I'd loved it if it would be more, but that wasn't going to happen. And it went perfectly. No stumbling, no soft or too loud voice. Ordered the guys in the back to be quiet, they listened. I now have a vast network of friends. Most of them are more acquintencens. Some I just hang out not because I like them so much, but because they have something I want. But there are a few good friends. And I know everything about everybody, first hand. No gossips. Boy, there are many things that can go wrong in someone's life. I wonder why people trust me so much. Saw a movie on the tube this evening with my sis. My sis and I don't hang with each other as much as we used to. I miss that. Tomorrow: hear wheter I go a schoolyear higher or if I have to do this year over. Also I'm going to hang with Albert. Will that turn out right? Don't know. I do not really like his kind of people
