And my smilie collection is constantly growing for the *cough* inevitable *cough cough* invisionpower board. As for articles...they've been put on a temporary halt as I did my first flash, but now that that's done, I'm back on track. I've decided to put 20 points in the Too much C'n'C one, so not much left to do. Random Thoughts...need two more thoughts to write about before that's finished.  So I end this blog post thingie with a quote from...Wilde.  "America is the only country that went from barbarism to decadence without civilization in between." -Oscar Wilde. Lovely quote describing one of my favourite countries, America. *Retches*  Tull,  urlLink Black Ghost Staff
