He was dead tired and the thought of driving 17 hours to Atlanta as orginally planned was not one he particularly relished.  After some discussion, he jumped online and booked 3 airline tickets for us to leave yesterday afternoon.    Well...Jay was the only one who left.  I went to bed early Sunday morning with chills then woke up halfway through the night in a sweat.  Just great! What a bad time to have a fever!  When I got up Sunday morning, getting on a plane was the last thing I felt like doing.  Thankfully enough, we were able to get a refund on the tickets for Jessica and I.  So I'm in Toronto another week. We leave next Sunday, since Jay has to fly in to attend his brother's Bachelor Party.   Jay and I are both a little frustrated.  He's beginning to hate the travel and we all hate being apart all week *sigh*.  In the meantime, I'm downing orange juice like its going out of style and getting plenty of rest.
