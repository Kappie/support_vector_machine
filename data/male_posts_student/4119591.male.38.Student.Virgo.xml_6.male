We rarely see films in the theater so it was a special treat to experience that for-real squeaky plastic chair and spilled soda under the feet environment that only a cinema movieplex can provide. But enough about that.  Terminator fans will find much to like here. However, I think newbie Terminator fans (those who have not yet seen parts one and two) will get lost quickly. John Connor (played well by Nick Stahl) is now in his early 20's; the doomsday date for earth has come and gone, thanks to the adventures that took place in  Terminator 2: Judgment Day . But just as we saw in that earlier film, the future is not set, and the arrival of two terminators from the future (one good and one bad) almost assures that the disaster of SkyNet will come to pass anyway.  Arnold's character is sent by humans back in time to protect John from the very blonde and very bad T-X (played by Kristanna Loken and a lot of computer magic). If you thought the T-1000 in the previous movie was flexible, wait until you see this new model!  As with the other films in this franchise, stuff blows up and all manner of unlikely things happen to our almost indestructible hero/villain Arnold "T-800" Schwarzenegger. This may come in handy for him should he decide to throw his hat into the California Governor Sweepstakes to be held later this year.  Allen and Tania give it 7 popcorn kernels out of 10. Go get in line right now.
