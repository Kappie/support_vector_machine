If you aren't watching now, you should be!  Here's the part of the post that was nice...  2.18 - 17 People  The episode that set up sweeps week, as well as the future of the show. Bartlet's MS is revealed to Toby, who freaks out and tears both Leo and Bartlet new cornchutes. (I actually would have enjoyed a scene where he goes off on the first lady and she slaps him. But this is a serious episode...) Meanwhile Sam and Josh try to write jokes for a speech for the Correspondent's Dinner. Sam invites Ainsley up to write jokes and the end up debating the Equal Rights Amendment. Powerful episode, masterfully captured by Alex Graves, who is probably the most talented director on the show since Schlamme left. Great acting from Marten Sheen, Bradley Whitford, Janel Moloney and Rob Lowe. However Richard Schiff turns in a powerhouse performance and steals the show and runs.  Also I don't understand dell. What is a dell exactly? And what does Dell Computers's catch phrase "Easy as Dell" mean. Cause it's stupid and I don't get it!
