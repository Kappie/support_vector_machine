I mean, i see your point - what better way to celebrate than be heavily reminded that your loved one could die any second over there? Bring on the fear.  Also... freedom is not free, whether it's Americans' freedom or Iraqis' freedom. We're all citizens in this global community. You said it makes you sick to see the dead children and civilians. Let's realize that Saddam Hussein was even worse...  Furthermore, servicemen *also their families* should not complain about this war. If they had been drafted involuntarily, it would be entirely different, but signing up for the armed services means pledging yourself to following the leader. You get many beneifts, but it's not meant to be a FREE RIDE as many take it to be. There's a reason you get such a big deal, and that's because you've signed up to possibly be called to put your life on the line.   I don't know why Bush had to invade looking for "weapons of mass destruction." Why couldn't Hussein just be kicked out for being evil? The UN seems like a bunch of BS to me right now. I hope to get a view of the European perspective whilst I visit.
