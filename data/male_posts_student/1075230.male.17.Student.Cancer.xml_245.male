One major difference this year for me has been my overall attitude; generally, i've been tired and much less cheerful than last year. I wonder why that is so... maybe increased workload? Parents continuous nagging near the very beginning? The fact that there are more things to worry about?  Any one - or a mixture - might be the cause.   I won't bore you guys with a play-by-play recount of my year, as any who reads this would probably have read every other post i've made =P no point in restating what has already been said.   School - the academic part which my parents is fixated on - was indeed harder this year. I found that it took longer for each unit, and the tests were many times harder. Not to mention the exams. I didn't need to May/June rush this year, but the afore-mentioned nagging really challenged my calm =P   As for the extracurricular part of the year, the stuff that really stood out were the intramural sports; specifically 3-ball. That was really fun, and i'm definitely going for that again ^^ i swear, if there was one thing in this school year that did not have stress attached to it, it's 3-ball.   Other events were fairly fun and memorable too... all those little things that happen that make up the entire gr.11 experience... yes, yuki would say that it's all very boring, and maybe she would be right ^^;;   ah, and got to know a little too many people... keeping track of all of them might also be why it's been a tiring year, i guess yuki will be my major time sink from now on ^^   *looks bak* Wow, i took 3 posts last year to sum up the year... lol
