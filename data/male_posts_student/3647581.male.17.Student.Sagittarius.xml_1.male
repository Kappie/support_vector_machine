As for the rest I helped my aunt move out yes she's moving to Dallas, whish sucks on two levels 1.)now I cant stay over and sneak out to see heather 2.)im actually going to miss that crazy girl. Well I am really committing my self to this musical aspiration of mine and im infatuated, I also cant stop thinking about how awesome today I went, I saw heather last night and at school she just made me laugh over and over she makes me ridiculously happy. I don't know what id do if I didn't have such wonderful person in my life. Im happy content and sleepy...
