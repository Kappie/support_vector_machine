I kinda thought after what happened on Tuesday there would be a lot more interest in my answer and stuff, but there wasn’t. I felt as if people were avoiding me or something, not in a nasty way, if you know what I mean. I was expecting far to much to happen Wednesday, I thought it would be the start of a whole new life and it wasn’t. When I got home I had a really big cry, it was the most I’d ever cried as far back as I can remember. My parents were away (looking at houses in Ireland) so, it didn’t matter how much noise I made. I let it all out. All my pent up depression, all my crap, I just got it all out of my system. Then I went downstairs took two paracetamol with a glass of water and went to sleep. I’ve never considered taking drugs, but these were amazing. I didn’t know drugs could help me so much. After resting for half an hour, I got up feeling fantastic, well, not fantastic, but an awful lot better than I had done previously. Then I went around the house doing house work, singing Sinatra and had some stuff to eat, watched a movie, and decided this would be a new start for me. I realised during my crying fit that I’ve been depressed for many years, but just accepted it as a part of my life. Seeing people around me recently having the time of their lives, only made me feel worse, from seeing what I did not have. That’s the reason for my recent extreme depression. So, I went to school, on Thursday, determined it would be different and it was. Second lesson was business, and as usual, I tried avoiding having to walk with Katie from IT. But she just hangs around waiting for me. She’s so stuck in routine. Anyway as we split to go our separate ways we kissed, I stuck my leg in the air, as usual, and gemma saw. She didn’t really comment on the leg and said something like aaarrrr. I sorta did a gay head shake and smile and went into the classroom. Then we had science, I think Laura K must have told Lloyd what happened on Tuesday, cause he made a comment on it. Something like what’s all this about laura asking whether you were gay, and you didn’t give an answer”, I started saying, “the reason I didn’t give an answer was” and then he interrupted with something like, “it’s ok if you gay”. I didn’t say anything. I think Lloyd thinks I’m gay, cause latter on he said he though the teachers were a bunch of homosexuals (as an insult rather than it’s actual meening), and there was a second-long, weird atmosphere and he kinda looked at me to see if he had offended me or something.  Anyway, that lunch time was really good. I didn’t sit next to Katie but opposite her, I find this is a much better way to sit cause by doing this I seem to get inside the group more. I had heather to my right and gemma to my left. It was good, despite the fact that some twat pulled my chair from under my arse causeing me to fall to the floor. But, it was after lunch that the really good stuff started to happen. On my way to PE, I caught up with Laura B. To start off with there was a kinda awakward silence, but I did something gay, like walk around a muddy area or something. She said “you’re so gay”. Then she said “are you bi”, I said no firmly, and she said “are you gay” and I said yeah. She responded with a kinda high pitch excited, wow, your gay, really, I can’t believe it and that sorta stuff, I looked over my sholder to see if anyone was around, I told her to keep it down and not make a big thing out of it. She did. She said she wouldn’t tell anyone, but I said I didn’t mind the girls knowing. On our way into the sports centre she said what are you gonna do about Katie, I said I didn’t know and that was that. I sat down for a crapy PE lesson with a massive smile on my face. That moment where I said “yeah” and she got excitable, will be something I will never forget, it will be one of those key moments of my life. Today, wasn’t quite as good, but a lot better than a lot of the days I’ve been having over the last nine months. Once again by sitting opposite Katie I found myself in a much better position to socialise with everyone. I was talking to Gemma quite a lot. It was good. I’m so happy right now.
