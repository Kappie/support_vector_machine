Interestingly, I put that up on  urlLink xanga  before I talked to this friend of mine. I made the mistake once of opening my mouth when I didn't really understand what she was saying, but this time around I felt like I really could relate to a lot of things she was saying. What is it about adoring chaos and loving order that we both deal with? Is it the modernist mentality of insatiable desire? Equilibrium is not enough for us?  Brave New World  and the movie  Equilibrium  are two artistic examples of that desire for chaos. Emotions perhaps exemplify chaos more than anything. It's always so complicated and constantly changing... for some more than others. Yet taking away that chaos, as argued in those two works, takes away our humanity. However, as a civilization, there is the opposing force of order that is needed for the maintenance of society. Freud goes into this in his psychoanalysis and in  Civilization and its Discontents .   So when it comes to human relationships what do we want? Chaos or order? Is being content enough?  If this friend happens to read this... I just want her to know that however she choses to navigate these two opposing forces, I'll be there for her.  ***
