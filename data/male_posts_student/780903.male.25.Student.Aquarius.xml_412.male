Seems like nothing's really safe anymore.  I'd trade a bit of personal freedom for a bit of security, I think.  Metal detectors at the door of every public building, security guards, bag searches... I'd be cool with all of it, if it can potentially stop bad stuff.  Of course, then they'll just do bad stuff that doesn't come through doorways and in bags....  No real solution I guess.  But, man, that Yale explosion is freaking me out.  Thank goodness no one was in the room.  Wow.
