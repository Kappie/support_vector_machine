It was one of those strange nights where I've completed all  my tasks but there were still people and that angered me. Another thing that angered me is that "work Amy" quit, she didn't give 2 weeks notice, that's bad. That lady taught me how to mop and she won't even say good bye before she goes to work at Benny's or Denny's. What a slut.
