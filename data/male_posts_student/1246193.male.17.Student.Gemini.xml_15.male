Got lots of good candy. It tastes so good but makes you feel so crappy if you eat too much.  Please help me.  I am being drawn toward the chocolate bunny.  It is evil.  It possesses my mind.  The only way to stop it is to bite off the bunny's head. No, I don't want to eat you little bunny, but I must.  I didn't know that bunnies had teeth. They look kind of shar.......AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  Watch out for the cute, fluffy ones, they are dangerous.
