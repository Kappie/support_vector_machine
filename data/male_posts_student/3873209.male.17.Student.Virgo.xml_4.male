She really pushed it... telling me wat to do... nope! I'm not gonna take it... coz i was talking in the library! Geeezzz... everyone talks... selective hearing. Since when have we lost our freedom of speech??? Damn it! So sick of people telling me wat to do. It's pissing me off... whether it's at home, sku or church! Anywhere! It's fine if they tell me the do things nicely I'll probably do it... bit damn it... if they use their authoity on me... i get really pissed... Like really pissed... damn it. So freaking pissed.  Bleh... I s'posed to practice my piano... but decided not do anything and piss of the teacher... so now I'm listening to Boyz... Keke... they are so good looking... and i like their songs... Yep yep!!! All is good... Damn it... i can't believe i cried infront of that COW!!! :@ soo pissed... Maybe i should turn this music up and drown myself in this stuff... yep yep...   Sigh... i think i have the record of having the most negative post so far!!! Oh wellz...
