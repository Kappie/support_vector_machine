Maybe I should introduce myself, or maybe I should bore you with the details of my day to day life, or MAYBE I could chronicle and outline a particular obession or bitch on about war and politics.  Well maybe I won't.  Well, I might as well introduce myself.  My name is Colin, and I'm 15 but 12 at heart. I live in my jeans, and sneakers. My interests include: music, Piano (I'm in grade 7 piano level), acoustic guitars and writing. I love the smell of freshly baked bread and playing cards. I like to waste my time on a sunday afternoon by idly strumming on my guitar or having a jam on my piano. My favorite colour is purple or blue and my favorite drink is Powerade (Coffee, technically is a BEVERAGE :). ) Well thats it for now.  Cheers!  Colin
