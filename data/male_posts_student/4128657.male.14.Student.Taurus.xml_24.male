Andre Gide:   One doesn't discover new lands without consenting to lose sight of the shore for a very long time.   Charles DuBois:   The important thing is this: To be able at any moment to sacrifice what we are for what we could become.   Mark Twain:   Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.   Ralph Waldo Emerson:   (probably erroneously) Whatever you do, you need courage. Whatever course you decide upon, there is always someone to tell you that you are wrong. There are always difficulties arising that tempt you to believe your critics are right. To map out a course of action and follow it to an end requires some of the same courage that a soldier needs. Peace has its victories, but it takes brave men and women to win them.
