I'm soo bored as well, someone add me/talk to me on MSN or something. I got no games as well! Well I have but I'm waiting for Doom 3, which comes out 3rd August... My god I can't wait, that game looks great. Got 94% in PCGAMER US, don't know what it will get here in the UK.  Oh yea, console gamers suck :P  Just thought I'd add that. Now I'm off, to play games most probably!
