Check out especially points 8 and 9:  "8. I am utterly unconcerned with having any sort of personal life outside the office.... If my mother's funeral was the day of a key deposition, I would do the eulogy via teleconference after the deposition.  If my wedding was on the date of a key trial, the wedding would be postponed...."  "9. If a piece of evidence was accidentally dropped into the garbage, I would have no problem going to the local dump and spending days covered knee-deep in the worst foul-smelling sludge imaginable to search for the evidence."  If this guy gets a job out of this, and he probably will, there's something wrong with the world.
