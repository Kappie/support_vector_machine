He is seeing everything from the outside, 3rd person view. He is still trying to find out where he belongs in society. Thats what's goin on with me. I see whats happening with other people's lives, but their's is too far from mine to relate to it. I seem to be able to help other's with their situation's but i can barely help myself out of mine. Like i was telling Tiger how to help Dragon. I was in Dragon's situation, so i can give my two cents on how to fix it. Though i don't know how to talk to Dragon one on one... Because of my age and the way people  think  i am, it's hard to really get my message through. Some, like Tiger, think i take life and everyone in it as a joke. Though in reality I'm the opposite. And i guess its my fault because that's the only side i show. And the whole time i was blaming Tiger that it was him not taking the time to figure me out. So to Tiger, I'm sorry. But there is more to me then just a silly kid who's all for games. And the irony is that this is what i always wanted to avoid. And yea, I've always been a vid head so that will never change. I can't really sit here and describe myself, i guess it takes the other person to find out. Sorry wouldn't want to publish a book on Justin, that could be dangerous haha. Then everyone would know all my tricks and thoughts. And i know how i go on bout tasha, meagan, ect. but i dont wanna go and just make the move. Yea, you would think its easy to do your thing once your at their house everyday with just them alone. Yea it would be easy but thats not what i want. Sad as it is, i like someone right now... though i always deny it everytime Tiger brings it up. And Tiger you better not say anything! But it's kinda unfortunate for me because of what is in the way of me getting to her. If you want to figure it out think of  Mulan (what's guarding her?). She's real cute and funny, and can't help it. She is probably one of the very few girls that i know that would actually say is  beautiful . Yea there are those girls who are cute, fine, and sexy, but for me to say beautiful, she's got to be something. I even told Tiger that i don't use that word freely. In my opinion its a very strong word. Too strong to use on just anybody. There you go i just revealed something, and it'll take you a bit of thought to decipher it, though i hope that one specific person doesn't figure it out. Or Tiger will laugh at me as i get whats bound to come to me.
