I like the idea of the infantry being able to kill things, and the no base thing. However the artillery can be a problem. A  major  problem. It's just the first of some huge balance problems.  I don't want to get into a story about a ground control game, because it's all the same and very boring to read. So, instead I will give you a pros/cons column:                 Pros                   Excellent grapics        Spectacular camera        Easy to move camera        Control scheme is easy to pick up        Infantry can take out vehicles        The firing and explosion effects look good        The vehicles take more damage from the sides/back        The Landing Zone and Victory Location system is intuitive                    Cons                   The artillery have a  very  long range        You need to constantly keep your units moving        Some units are overpowered and overarmored        The 16-unit selection limit        The dropship upgrades are underused        The balance is TERRIBLE        Everybody online is better than you        When I say the balance is terrible, we're not talking one side is better than the other. I'm saying that you only need to build 4 types of units, the rest having no effect. If you build Rocket Terradynes, Ravager Terradynes, Artillery, and a few Combat Engineers you will have no trouble. In fact, if there was a game type where a point was placed in the game and the goal was to build the most Ravagers by then, it would pretty much mimic what the winning players do. I'm not joking.  Beyond that, there's not a lot to say. Yeah, it's a good game, but it really,  really  depends on what you like. For lots of people, this is going to be one rockin game. For me? not so much.   Ratings  Graphics: 10 This game looks great, even on low end computers. It runs well, and it runs well on systems below the minimum specs. The explosions, firing effects, models, everything looks excellent.  Sound: 8 All the sounds are solid, and I like how some things sound different as you get farther away. There's nothing spectacular about them though.  Network Performance: 9 This is no surprise. There is little to no lag, and the worst performance gets down to is some occasional stutters.  Gameplay: 6 It's fun, sometimes. But the balance is thrown off and most of the matches are the same.   Features: 7 The secondary mode feature is very helpful. Plus, you can call in airstrikes, battlefield sensors, and smoke grenades. There's nothing to really phone home about though.  Overall: 6.5 I have to say, I like  the game in spite of some of its flaws. And, it's not nearly as bad as Warcraft 3. However, suffice to say that I don't like it to the tune of fifty dollars.
