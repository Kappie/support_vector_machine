The download wizard won't download them, the alternate download song won't play. To top it off, they're in WMA format. I think that's the sound of me losing interest. Come ooooooon iTunes. Secondly - Gmail, for some reason I couldn't get gmail to load up though IE on my PC - reason being, the "submit" button didn't show up on login. I add one site (https://www.google.com, oddly enough, not https://gmail.google.com,) and I've got access.  A single email from both companies, one regurgitating the nearly useless FAQ, the other provinding a specific reference to the fix and how to apply it. I'll let you decide which is which.  Strange whacked out dream last night. I was in Niagara Falls, but I was wanted by the Feds. They'd sent someone after me and two of my friends, we escaped in their car, which at the time was towing bottles of explosive gas. I "knew" we'd have to cross the border into the states, but they were watching... so how? That's when I woke up. Bizarre.
