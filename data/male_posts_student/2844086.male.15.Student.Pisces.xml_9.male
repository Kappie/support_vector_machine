It's already been out a day and I have yet to see it! Most will know that I am talking about "The Passion". Oh but I have heard many people talk about how wonderful it is. I so can't wait. I just know that it's going to be awesome.  Anyway I'm really sick! And I'm tired. But don't think that is going to stop me from going to revival. 'Cause it's not! I'm telling you though I really believe that God is going to manifest Himself. I really and truly believe that I am going to see Him tomorrow. And I'm telling you that even if I don't, I have already experienced Him more than I ever have.
