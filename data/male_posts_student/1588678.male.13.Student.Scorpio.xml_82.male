I could easily say Rolling Stone magazine is one of them. I agree with my brother when he says Rolling Stone comes out with a Collectors Issue with countdown shit every month! That always bugs me, because most of them really suck! The two the rubbed me the wrong way the most was 500 Greatest Albums; there's probably only 100 great albums out there! And then their latest Greatest Moments That Changed Rock  Roll. That suck ass! Mainly because on the cover they show a picture of Eminem. He isn't even remotely close to be called a rocker! But anyways, you get the point. And then there's Comedy Centrals Mouthing Off: 51 Greatest Smartasses. I mean, half the people on it were either animated cartoon characters or fictional TV characters. And it was stupid as hell when they had Bill Murray at number one instead of someone like Denis Leary (who got like the 20 spot). How much bullshit can I take with this kind of stuff?! And the something-countdown of the Greatest TV Shows on E! It was okay, I knew that Seinfeld would win, which it did. Some shows I agreed with the spot. I thought they said it was a "Shows We Wish Were Back On," but they had the Simpsons and Will  Grace (sadly on there). Oh well.  Drop off a comment of your favorite stupid countdown.
