I would like to bridge the gap between us by purchasing you two tickets to "One Man Star Wars" in Chicago. I can't provide lodging or transportion, but Expedia frequently has good deals. The show is playing at The Noble Fool theatre and is playing January 1st and 3rd. It is probably playing more in the future beyond that but Ticketmaster has no information. Provide dates, and if tickets are available they're yours.
