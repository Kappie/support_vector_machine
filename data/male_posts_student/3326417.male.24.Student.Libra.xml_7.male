Increasing concerns about a variety of issues lead to the question: How long before we enter into socialized medicine? 41 million Americans do not have health insurance and according to the case 80% of them are working. I currently do not have health insurance and I work. What would I do in an emergency? Well there is always the emergency room, but I know how much of a pain in the butt that experience is. The University provides free basic care to all students, but my major plan is to avoid going to the hospital at all costs. This means limiting my risks and exposure to potential harmful agents. But if I wanted health insurance could I get it? Yes. Through work or even through an extended program through the University. If one wanted health insurance they could have it. People will have to make a choice between a cell phone, cable, etc. and health insurance.
