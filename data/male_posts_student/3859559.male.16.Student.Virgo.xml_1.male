I have been a wreck since then and I think I am finally pulling through it now. I have said all I need to say to her and am ready to move on even though I still care about her. Now I am single again like it always seems to be for me. So I think now then only thing to do know is to fill the void with someone new since I have the fellin that the love of my life will never give me another chance there is nothing else to do. I now bid her well with her life the one I am not apart of and walk of into the sunset never to bother her again.
