The nightly ritual grew into a happening, and on occasion we'd have up to 10 folks on the field in a circle, throwing the frisbee, laughing, tackling each other just for the fun of it.  I'd often make a run, slide on my knees to catch it, and try to flick it to the person behind me as if I was completing the second leg of a double play.    One time, after the lights were installed on Jones-Rice but before Matthew had carte blanche to do whatever he wanted on campus, security guards Preston and John came by to see what the commotion was, and we included them in a few rounds of throws.  Preston, a Vietnam vet who was often voted the campus' favorite officer, wore his gun and holster during the festivities...it weighed him down so much that every lunge became a fanciful stumble to regain his balance, and all of us sharing visions of internal hemmorage or accidental gunfire.  I'm not saying that we brought Ultimate to Centenary...guys like Tigger Denison and Cliff "Close Your Legs" Magnus, as well as Britton "Lipschitz" Lipscomb, were playing weekly rounds of Ultimate on Fridays...about 10 or 15 folks, usually consisting of quiet science majors, would line up on opposite ends of the field and engage in a game, which at the time seemed overly dramatic and not near as much fun as throwing the frisbee up into a wind gust and seeing how far it would implant itself into the ground upon descent.    After a while it seemed obvious to merge.  Matthew, Brian, Nick Missios, JW, Leif, myself, and a very sexy sports bra-clad Sarah Lagersen rolled out for Ultimate matches, sometimes playing the Science crew, other times getting enough of the Dave McCormick/Corey Pavletich posse involved to have a game if the Science folks weren't around.  Games held no dramatic aura that I expected...we ran around, caught the frisbee, stopped, and tried to throw it to someone on our team.  We always preferred to be on the team that didn't have Sarah, because it meant we could get away with tackling her in her sweaty wonderness, then helping her up and exchanging the playful hug.  I remember one game in particular, that Fall, with maybe 20 or so folks playing, where Matt Bowden, who was never known for his athletic acumen, posted up in the end zone and called for the disc.  I got over to cover him, and he ran to the corner of the end zone, with me in pursuit.  He turned back, and I cut before him to get the advantage.  The frisbee came flying, and as I looked, I saw that he was still behind me, standing his ground in the corner, having executed the most glorious spin move.  Touchdown.    That game was also great because Nick Missios got mercilessly tackled by Dave McCormick at least four times.    Matthew decided to turn this Apple Dumpling Gang into a team, so we could go to tournaments and play some honest competition.  This hit well with the new recruits, but the establishment balked.  We played ultimate to relax, have a good time, get some exercise, chat with friends, see Ceci Salinas run around in blue scrubs, and enjoy the weather.  To create practices, drills, and a serious mentality seemed to get away from what we started frisbee for.  And so Matthew and JW took Frisbee and applied a more regimented side to it, while Missios, Bowden, Sarah, and I faded from the sport.  I played with them as much as possible, but I didn't have the time to apply to the practices and tournaments (save a trip to College Station and another to Baton Rouge), and I wasn't near the athlete anymore.    Those of us who founded the sport with Matthew began to blame him for many of the problems our group of friends was experiencing.  He was called out for ruining Spaghetti Night, a tradition I started where we would hit Notini's Restaurant on Wednesday nights for their all-you-can-eat spaghetti and bread dinner for $2.99.  It lasted maybe eight weeks before Matthew usurped my power, leaving me out of two nights in a row, and inviting people like Lori Bradshaw and Rachel Day to the festivities.  The usurption led to a shouting match between the two of us in the student union, one of my less enjoyable moments, but the guy was cutting me out of spaghetti night, my own creation.  I also later blamed Matthew for the death of oral sex on campus, for reasons never explained by anyone.    Matthew kept his team together for two years, getting a few very good players out of it, as well as enjoying the hell out of himself.  Notini's never recovered.  And now, I am coaching the TIP Leadership kids in Ultimate for a showdown with the TIP East Campus All-Stars.  They don't want to do the drills or look at the strategy...they just want to throw the high, long, angling pass, let Dennis catch it, run around a bit, and have fun.  I can't blame them.
