I woke up at 9 and got up and 9:30 which was when my parents told me that we were going to yumcha and were leaving now. This prompted me to get dressed and cleaned in something like 10 minutes (and a pretty good job i'd say). I won't go into why we were going to yumcha on Sunday because it'll take too long. Let's just say it involves my grandmother who is staying here at the moment. Due to track work in the city, we caught a bus to central (again don't ask why we were eating in central).  The first sign of trouble was when we got there and noticed quite a large crowd of people standing outside the yumcha place. This turned out to be people waiting for a table. Now we had to wait for a table and we waited...and waited...and waited and pretty soon i was quite pissed off and bored because i was hungry as i missed breakfast and i brought nothing to do. After an hour i rang andy out of pure boredom and talked to him from a payphone in the middle of this waiting crowd (note: if anybody ever wants to be a person i call out of pure boredom please leave a name plus number). By now i have a fat headache caused by loud random noise caused by annoyed people. Then i get pulled off the phone because we finally get a table. So i'm eating with a large headache still with lots of noise. Not good. When we finished we went to Chinatown etc. all the asian places asian people go in the city. I was travelling along in a kinda drugged trance due to headache. When we got home at 4 i went straight to bed and i just woke up. Anyway RICE was fun, saw lots of people, learnt some new stuff, relearnt some old, saw a HP3 (not that bad). And that was my weekend.
