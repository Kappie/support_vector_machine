We decided this afternoon to place a bit of a bet on WSEX, the great online evil other than porn.  I felt really good about Carolina with a spread, considering their penchant for close games, their strong defense, and a league average New England offense.  But to place a bet online, I'd have to pony $300 to start an account, well more than I wanted to pay.    So the Tripster, well versed in picking Arkansas-Pine Bluff to round out a five team parlay, decided it'd be a good idea for us to pool our resources to make a few bets.  I threw him $75, and he matched it, and we placed some monies down.  The roundup:  $80 on Carolina (+7) to win $70 $12 on Steve Smith to catch a pass over 21.5 yards to win $10 $13 on Stephen Davis to rush for more than 72.5 yards to win $10 $30 on John Kasay to score more than 7.5 points to win $39 $20 parlay on Carolina to win straight up AND the combined score to be over 38 to win $100  Davis was out of the running pretty quick, but the over bet looked good most of the afternoon.  And then Carolina made a game out of it, and took a lead and then the big tie with a minute left (btw, terrible timeout call by Carolina when they had 1st and 10 at the 15 with 1:40 left...let the clock run, the last thing you need is time when you've got four plays and three timeouts to get it in the end zone...take the 40 off the clock, call your timeout then, and that gives you the last possession of the game).  And what looked really good at that point was the Carolina staple of overtime followed by a Kasay field goal to win...we'd win the $100 bet, as well as the $40 for Kasay...mix that with previous winnings, and we'd have $100 each.  But Kasay had his worst kickoff. ever, and I'm settling with a few extra bucks of spending cash.    And now I write, a few more episodes of WEST WING under my belt, listening to some sappy inspirational music that I keep in check for a while, mostly synth.  It always is.    I find myself less willing to take the shit most people throw at me about 80s music.  Tastes and preferences, yes.  But the constant berating of all facets of the decade is no longer going to be met with passive aggression.  Last night I got into it with Brian Thomas for only the second time in my life, specifically because he took a few shots at 80s music.  We were listening to Siouxsie and the Banshees, a great goth meets new wave band of the 1980s, one of the pioneers of the last 20 years of college rock.  The band I played before that, Alan Parsons Project, had been a disappointment, and the past hour had been a bash-fest on the 1980s, so I said, "You might not like this sound, but you've got to appriciate it."  Brian made some side comment about it sucking, met with laughter by the table.  So I got out the big gun, saying, "Not everyone likes two guys dicking around on acoustic guitars for 20 minutes."    Brian paused for a moment.  Probably longer.  "I love that comment," he said, in his "I know more than you" attitude, "because when people say it, it shows that they're not really listening to it."  Now, looking back on the battle, I can see his fallacy here...regardless of whether I'm listening to it or not, his comment on the 80s shows his lack of attention to Siouxsie.  But I missed that inroad.  And the commentary stopped, we took a break, and I took it up outside with him.    Here's where it got me - I said something about acoustical guitar, a misstatement I often make, don't know why but I do call it acoustical rather than acoustic.  And he called me on it, for no reason other than to be a dick...it had nothing to do with the argument I was making, but he needed to point it out to weaken my position.  Then he took a few specifics and showed my lack of understanding in them (quite in the same vein of the Christian Coalition), never bothering to listen to my contention:  that the world of music doesn't start and stop with jam bands.    When it comes down to it, I don't like jam bands.  Nothing against them, I just don't enjoy it, which is odd, because I love the hell out of jazz.  I don't like the sound of the acoustic guitar.  Twangy.  And not just bluegrass...acoustic rock is the same way.  Give me something smooth...a synthesizer, a piano, a trumpet...that's what I dig on.  And I've listened to quite a bit of jam rock in my life...living with Brian for a year gave me more than enough...and they do their thing, and that's great, and it's just not my thing.  And it has nothing to do with feeling music, because I've played more music than Brian has, and probably more than most people, and I get into it, and I feel it, and it moves me, and it changes the performance.  I don't jam though...that might be it.  I never had an instrument where you'd just sit and fiddle...there was always somewhere to go, and you loved the journey.    I probably put him on the defensive with my guys dicking around comment.  But he threw me there a lot earlier.  I don't know...synth/new wave is a strong part of who I am, no matter what I say...happiness can be achieved by the right obscure 80s song...and I'm tired of having people shit on the genre because Kenny Loggins had some hit songs.  And I so rarely get mad, and I so rarely hold a grudge.
