Gwen forbade me from making a move on Miller, Scott's being irrational and forbidding me from not... and last night I had a dream about the Yr. 8 Flautist called Rosie. Slightly paedophilic but she's so cool, fairly small, and not bad looking. Waah. Jon feels dirty.  Scott is just generally trying to push me into relationships I'm not ready for. I can understand why, don't get me wrong, but that doesn't stop it from being annoying and distressing.  The group at school is being torn apart.  Seb doesn't like me no mo.  My throat's packing up.  Dr. Fugler can't accompany me on Thursday.  Mrs. Stanley doesn't like me much because she knows now that I may be in hospital during Pirates of Penzance.  Colwell is beginning to think that I'm getting too much money out of them.  Everyone's either not talking to me or finding me annoying.  My story needs redoing.  I've got to do a shitload of coursework.  I've got nothing better to do than blog.  I got a 3E for my physics h/w, and 7/24 for my Maths.  I didn't do my paper round.  On brighter notes, I've ordered the sheet music for the musical "Chess" today, as have I ordered Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men".  I just had a cheese and pickle sandwich.  CAYO tomorrow, and a band rehearsal.  I'm so tired...
