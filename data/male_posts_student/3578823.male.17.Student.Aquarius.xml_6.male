Seeing as if I could even have a even nice day in the few days past or few days in the future, or even had any cool ideas I could share with the group. Hell, I wish I could talk about something funny that happened to me today. But no, I've been sitting in front of my computer for about *looks at watch* 3 weeks now. Considering I made  few  trips. Last saturday I went to see the new  Harry Potter  movie. I found it to be pretty swell. A couple days before that, I actually got to go to Wal*Mart! *Sigh*. And the weekend before that I attended a 24-Hour LAN party at a friends house. That has been my summer thus far. With only 4 days to go till UB...Oh yeah, UB is short for "Upward Bound". This is a government funded program ran by dedicated employees who work year-round to make sure everyone is doing well in school and home. In the summer, a group of high schoolers(sophmores to just graduated seniors)come together to live on a college campus(in this case,  urlLink Berea College ) for a total of 6 weeks(we get 1 week to go home after the 3rd week, and then come back for the remainder). We go there and take different classes that can help improve our academic composition, and they help us with anything we need. It's really beneficial. Oh, and they pay us to be in it. That's right, every week you are there in the summer they give you $20, plus extra money during trips to eat and shop. And they pay us during the year to go to reunions and such. Wow, I guess I can talk about a lot(even though that's not really a lot). Eh, I guess talking about how people talk to much can end up getting pretty long. That'll be it for now. Auf Wiedersehen!
