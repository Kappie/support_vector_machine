You know, the reason I get 10-20 less kills per game than David and John some games is because they usually play on the so-called "good" team. I usually play on the team with the most people, which means 1/2 to 2/3 of them suck. Which equates to easier kills for them and the Hobster. I was playing against Jake, David, and John today, and I had to work for my kills, whereas 1/2 of my team sucked and were gimmes for them.  Speaking on Halo, we plan to implement phase two of our Halo rivalry, namely a flaming bag of poop on my mom's doorstep, on Thursday. If there need be a step three, Jarid has volunteered to supply us with some fireworks.   Turns out on Friday John wasn't going to eat with his grandparents, like he claimed. Although after he left everyone pretty much agreed that he was going to hang out with Pammy.   I'm done cutting up the Joe Day concert. It seems that the second song just walked off and left, which really sucks. But it is 20 minutes long and I got some good Chris/Chris footage for my documentary.   The end of school, like every year, seems anticlimactic. I mean, the same thing goes down every year. I suppose some people are graduating who I'll probably never see again. God, I hope I won't be so weepy when our senior year gets over. I probably won't. I don't like the majority of the sophomores.   There are six people that can blog here, and Hobe hasn't even blogged once. I understand, what with the tennis and the getting rocked and whatnot. But there is no excuse for everyone else to not do it if Houley can. He is like the busiest person in Brainerd.   I've gotta replace my chemistry book. That looks to be setting my dad back 50 bucks. It is a bunch of garbage, because I'm pretty sure that book was almost unusable when I got it.  Tomorrow is the last day of TV Pro and German. I've had Frau Wied for three years now, and I think she is a good teacher. I don't really care about German ending, though. On the other hand, I'm going to miss all the people from TV Pro. Some of them are even my friends (though I'd hate to admit to Hannah and Kali that I will miss them). Next year's class is going to be much less talented than this year. But more about that when I'm in a different mood, I think.  I've decided that Chris Derby is the Flexo to my Bender. Yes, I bet Hobie is the only person in Brainerd who understood that. We are similar, yet he seems to have decended into full-blown assholery while I am still back on jerk. We're two sides of the same unbalanced coin.  I didn't have anything to write about tonight. Maybe tomorrow I will write about something interesting. May your everloving soul bounce on.
