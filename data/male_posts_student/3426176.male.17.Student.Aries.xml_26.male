Today, I went with my sister, her boyfriend, his brother, and two of their friends to see NASCAR Busch Series and Nextel Cup Qualifying. We got to the parking lot, which was a giant field and walked all the way around the track to the entrance. We could hear each car go by as they did their qualifying laps. We got in and looked at the sky and knew we were screwed. Dark black clouds and green clouds hung over our heads ominously. We got seats and sat down to watch two cars qualify. Then a giant Tropicana blow-up orange broke loose and ran a qualifying lap of its own. A safety truck tried to corner it, but the runaway orange rolled right over it. When the orange crossed the finish line, the crowd cheered. The orange finally got hung up in the safety fence in turn one. It was popped, but still stuck to the fence. The safety crew finally got the orange off the fence when the first raindrops pelted the track... then poured. We ran under the grandstands and stood in a little dry rectangle. After the it rained for an hour and the crew dried the track for another hour and a half, it was time to continue qualifying! I got up close to the fence to take pictures of Kasey Kahne's car and Tony Stewart's car. I will post them later when they get developed.   Back to the Italian madness:      The alarm rang at 03:15. Or somewhere around there. It was too damn early, let me just say that. Anyway, I got dressed, put contacts in, got everything I needed for the three hour bus ride in my bag, and was ready for take off. Werner and I got to the coach bus around 3:45 so we were early. We were waiting for 10 minutes after our scheduled depart time when Eric, Alan, and Pietro arrived fashionably late. After that, everyone was aboard so it was off to the Vatican.   The five hooligans (Me, Tim, Eric, Anthony, and Robert) sat in the five-seat backseat on the bus. Occasionally, Beatrice would come by and sandwich herself between Eric and me. We talked most of the way there about random stuff while looking through Robert's Italian dictionary for off the wall phrases and obscene words. For example, we learned how to communicate with animals from that book. Then someone took it a step further and called me "assholeballs" in Italian. How do you mess that up? Then Tim remarked that the Pope's home should be renamed "Pope-al Stadium".   Yeah, that made no sense either.      Eventually we got to the Vatican. We got out and climbed down an eternity of stairs and there we were. We were at Pope-al Stadium.        We got inside and found our seats. Originally, this was only supposed to be a private gathering with us and about 200 other people, but somehow, over 1,000 people were in attendance. They were groups of people from all over the world. I believe the entire... ceremony I guess one can call it... was delivered in five languages. (English, Italian, German, Spanish, French) The Pope made his way out and everyone took a bunch of pictures. Here's something that bothered me: it was over 90 degrees, the Pope almost 90 years old, and he is in bad health so why is he in layers of heavy polyester robes and gowns? That's not smart if you ask me. Here's something else that is on my mind: why is it that the holier the place I go, the more morbid my inner thoughts become? Why was I hoping for the Pope to suddenly croak? Why was I hoping for some strange little catastrophe to happen? Why was I booing everyone else when their respective group was called out? Oh well, I'm going to Hell.        After the Pope's little ordeal was mercifully over, it was time to go... somewhere else. Oh yeah, we were supposed to go to the Sistine Chapel, but for some unknown reason we couldn't. So for the next two hours we wandered about eating our packed lunch, going out into the town square for a drink and gelato and just chillin'. While we were chillin', Tim made a bet with me that Eric was about to "get some" on the trip. I set the wager at $5 and counted down the days until payday. I was sure I was going to win. Later, I ordered myself a gelato with ease and looked at a little shop that was selling cheap knock off jerseys of famous soccer players.      We eventually had to gather again to go. So we all wentto walk to the bus. The walk was uphill on a narrow sidewalk. That's a stressful walk when the group is over 60 people large. We made it after about 20 minutes and I thought that it was finally time to escape the heat and make it back on the bus... I was incredibly wrong. It was time to go into... someother holy building and look around. We had to split up into two separate groups because our group was so large.        We got to the end of that so I decided to get an early jump on everyone and I left with Matteo, Ulderico, and Anthony. We would eventually run into Alan, Eric, and Bea. We got to the exit, but to our surprise, no one else was there. We sat around at a gift shop like the tour guide said and waited for about 15 minutes when we decided we should try and find everyone else. Reluctantly, we got up and tried different exits of where everyone else might have been. Luckily, Matteo had his mobile and he called Werner who was sitting comfortably on the bus. Matteo decided we all should walk back to the bus to be safe. We were walking back when Alan ran into some of his old Italian friends. He stopped to talk with them for a minute or two and brought them with us to our trek back to the bus. We happened to run into a few of thechaperones on the way back and they decided to go with us back to the bus. We were on the same path we went on to the entrance and were almost done when we saw the whole group we lost rushing in the opposite way. Extremely frustrated that we made the long trip in vain, we went back to go into the Sistine Chapel, the same chapel we were denied access to in the first place.       We hauled ass and followed everyone to the entrance to the Sistine Chapel... which was a few feet from where we were in the first place! We rushed through security, the chapel, and all of the stuff inside. I touched the famous foot of St. Peter for good luck. I think it is supposed to bring good luck. After that, we left for the bus.      The walk back to the bus took an eternity. It was hot and we walked uphill most of the way. We finally got to the bus and everyone filed in. We were waiting for about another 20 minutes because Alan was missing. The tour guide got on the microphone and made a remark about us being behind schedule because we were wasting time. Wasting time? They were the ones whomade us sit around for two hours because they wouldn't let us in the Sistine Chapel and they want to complain to us? Piss off.      Alan finally made his way to the bus and was unjustly disciplined for losing his way. We headed for home, but first made a quick drive by the Colisseum. Towards the end of the bus ride, Werner, Matteo, and Bea started a raucous rendition of the Italian National Anthem and other Italian songs. Frankly, I enjoyed it. But then, a few American girls started the worst rendition of "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" in the history of man. Even worse than Mike Ditka. Yeah. That bad.      We finally made it home and it was time for the first good news of the trip: THE LUGGAGE ARRIVED!!!! Most of it at least. There were a few pieces missing and it was reported that some of the suitcases were destroyed. We got to the Hotel Arlecchino was told that the luggage was at the Hotel Progresso. We got there and searched for our luggage. We found most of it. My mum's suitcase was wrapped in packaging tape. My dad's suitcase had the zipper ripped off and gouges on the outside. My suitcase had a huge rip in the side of it and several scratches on the surface. I couldn't wait to get home and see if anything was missing. As long as my soccer shoes are in there, I would be OK.      But first, I was starving so we made a quick jaunt to a nearby McDonald's. I was really interested to notice the difference between Italian McDonald's and American McDonald's. I ordered a Big Mac and noticed that it was not as greasy as the American version and the bread was somewhat stale. The meat tasted better and the secret sauce was a little bit sweeter. I heard from people that the fries were alot better because they had olive oil on them. I think I like them the same.      I opened up my suitcase to discover that half of what I packed was gone. Two new pairs of shorts were gone. My shaving kit was gone. A shirt was gone. But worst of all, those bastards at the airline STOLE MY SOCCER BOOTS!!!  (Long obscene rant deleted)        Angry, I got ready for bed and went to sleep. Those bastards will rue the day...     Day 5 later. I will alsoadd pictures once I finally learn how.
