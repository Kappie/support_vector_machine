I woke up and I went with rob and my sister to his friend's house to work.Me and my sister moved shingles into a wheelbarrow around a house and then we had to throw them in a huge dumpster then do it all over again. all in all we probably moved 2,000 lbs of shingles. there was a lot. after that we had a party. we cooked a bunch of brotworst and hotdogs and we listened to music. We also played this awesome game. It was a game that shocked you. It was awesome!well i g2g b/c im beat and i want to go to bed lol. cya
