ASHLEY I LOVE YOU!  you are an awesome person!  and you are beautiful ashley!  dont ever think that you arent!  anyone who tells you that is blind!  i feel like i've found someone who can somewhat understand me.  even though i dont talk to her as much as i would like...she is such a good person.   	yeah well i do feel slightly better now.  actually im more in one of those moods where you dont feel anything really.  im too tired of feelings to feel anything.  im still sad about Mal.  i miss her sooooo much.  i cant even describe how much i do.  im very upset about my family.  erik and dad just stress me out!  and they have forever.  they dont even know it.  i talked to my mom a little.  it helped.  somewhat.  at least it was nice to talk.  she's like the only person in my family i really talk to.  i guess its easier to talk to her cuz we have so much in common.  we're so much alike its almost scary.  i dont talk to my dad much.  it bothers him i've found out.  i never knew he really cared.  or that he wanted me to talk to him.  i've never thought about askin him to help with my emotional stuff.  i dunno.  he's not like me at all.  he's not sensitive or anything.  i dunno.  i guess i just dont think he'd be able to understand as much as mom does.  yeah well...ok.  im done.  blah.  i swear i dunno what im feeling.  its like...nothin even though i know what feelings are there.  im so screwed up.   too tired to feel.  aww well.  this is it for tonight.  off to watch 24.  goodnight.
