[Chorus] Well, it's love (It's love) Make it hurt (I deserve it) Well, it's love (It's love) Make it hurt (I deserve it) Well, it’s love, it’s love, it’s love... Make it hurt. I said I use the inconsistencies That undress the machine, You're the poster boy, their selling point, the focus for their new campaign. (Something has to be) Bound to come around about (Bound to come around) Oh, but can’t you, can’t you feel it rolling off your lips, Tensing up your shoulders, c’mon... [Chorus] The keys to the castle (Are right where I left them)The princess walked in just to take more attention, 'Cause after all, well isn't that all that I've been after and, After all, well isn't that all that I'm after, You're so...(No way out) I give up in you, well, I give up in you, (No way out) I give up in you. (No way out) Well, I give up in you, I give up in you, (No way out) Well, I give up in you. I wanted you for nothing more, Than hating you for what you were, If that's what you wanted to hear, (Well, if that's what you wanted to hear) I wanted you for nothing more, Than hating you for what you were, (Don't leave, leave) If that's what you wanted to hear, (If that's what you wanted to hear) I wanted you for nothing more, Than hating you for what you were, (Don't leave, leave) If that's what you wanted to hear, (If that's what you wanted to hear) (It's love, it's love) I wanted you for nothing more, (Make it hurt, I deserve it) Than hating you for what you were, (If that's what you wanted to hear) That's what you wanted to hear, (To hear) If that's what you wanted to hear. (If that is how you'll let it burn)
