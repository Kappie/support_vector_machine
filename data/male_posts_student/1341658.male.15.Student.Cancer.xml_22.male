Only for a short moment.   urlLink Service to offer movies over Net / RealNetworks, Starz Encore Group team up in venture :  "The two companies plan to start the service, called Starz Ticket on Real Movies,' today. The service, which costs $12.95 per month, is only available to PC users with high-speed Internet access.   The firms first announced plans for the new service in December 2002. But executives said the timing hasn't been right until now, when broadband Internet access has spread to about 26 million U.S. homes.   And the success of licensed music services like Apple Computer's iTunes Music Store and RealNetwork's Rhapsody against free but unlicensed file- sharing networks like Kazaa 'show consumers are willing to pay for online content,'' said Richard Wolpert, RealNetwork's chief strategy officer.   The new service will offer a selection of at least 100 new major Hollywood movies and older films that are released to the home video market at the same time as they are on the Starz cable channels, which reach about 23 million homes with digital cable. About 25 percent of the selection is replaced weekly with new films.   The movies, which are about 600 MB each and take an average of 20 minutes to download, are played back in 'near DVD quality'' on the computer, Wolpert said. A movie like 'Pirates of the Caribbean'' takes longer to download because it takes up 700 MB of hard drive space. Subscribers can download as many films as their computers can store. To prevent piracy, however, the movies can't be transferred out of the computer."
