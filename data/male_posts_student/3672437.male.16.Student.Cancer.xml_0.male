I will be posting any news of my student exchange to America here so keep looking for news as I wont be able to send messages to everyone except if i keep them really short.  Let me give you a run down on whats happening.  I'm leaving on the 7th of August, 2004 to Nashville, Tenessee(in the mid south of the USA) for a 5 month exchange program. I'm staying with 'The Pitts', Ginny and Greg Pitt and I'll be going to East Literature Magnet High School. I'll be getting back on about the 7th of January unless I get to stay in Chicargo for a week or so.  I made the first phone call to the Pitts today. Has anyone heard the way that someone from deep south America talks? well it was so hard to understand them at first and they found it hard to understand me. Both of us ended up talking really slowly and loudly and by the end of the 5 min conversation we had basically said hi, how excited we were, what the weather was like and goodbye. Still it was good to put a voice to a name.  I will keep you updated on the exchange more regularly once it actually begins.
