Heh, OK, I'm glad to say I'm back and ready to blog...sorta!  Now, in the wise words of  Nick , lets move on, shall we?  Right, well, I sorta consider myself a cross between an optimistic and pessimistic person, so I guess it would be very opti-pessimistic of me to say that my life has been suckin', but that things will pick up.  Well, whatever you wanna call that statement, thats the way it was, always has been, and always will be.  Life sucks.  Its a known fact, isn't it?  I mean, scientifically proven and everythin'?  Haha, maybe not, and I don't know if my life will always suck...hell, I'm just a confused kid.  Dunno what to think sometimes, you know?  In risk of contradictin' my statement of "it always will be," I don't believe in destiny...I don't think some awesome power controls your fate...unless you consider yourself an awesome power.  What I mean is, its the paths that you choose that really determine where you go.  Pretty much, its all up to you.  Anyway, I'm gettin' all philosophical, and I want to stop.  Lots has been up, but since my sister is tellin' me to go and get ready for a family party, I guess I'll just leave that for a later bloggin' topic.  Just be fuckin' glad I was nice enough to throw you all a fuckin' bone OK?  More to come...!
