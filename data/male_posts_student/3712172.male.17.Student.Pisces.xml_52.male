Life flies by much to fast for my liking.  Work was alright I guess today, our systems were down for pretty much the entire day so I didn't really put much effort into helping anybody because I didn't have the necessary tools to do so. They shoved a bunch of the supervisors on T-Mobile today into Target's section so I was away from all of my co-workers except for the 5 I was with in Target. I purposely saved  urlLink Christie  a seat today and within 10 minutes of my shift they shoved me away from T-Mobile society. A lot of shit is going on at work now as well, I could almost even refer to it as drama.  For starters, there is a new representative who has been giving some supervisors very rude and arrogant behaviour, and in turn, complains that the supervisors are being rude. So they took all of us and warned us all that other reps have been complaining on how us T-Mobile supervisors are being complained on for being rude. I understand that it needs to be relayed to us - but it bothers me that this even has to be brought up. Why would anybody in the right state of mind be rude to someone with no apparent reason? I know damn well I do my job right and I would never disrespect another co-worker - no matter how rude they are with me. I would deal with it in a much different manner.  Too many things get started around there as well, it's like a fucking soap opera - work style. I attempt to stay out of it all, but now that I work full time shifts it's hard not to see a lot of what goes on there. It's a job - and it needs to be taken that way. Save the drama for your personal time, because it's one thing I dislike.  I try my best to disregard that kind of stuff, I have seen and put up with enough in the past with friends and family - it's as if people like the rise they get out of it? I suppose each of us indirectly contribute to it, but even so - can you help it?  Anyways, back on to a different subject. I am kind of tired tonight as I lacked some sleep last night, which was kind of a stupid thing of me to do, but I tried my best to fall asleep.   In turn, I did happen to fall asleep a bit after 3 - then I woke up a 9:30, not too bad but still, tonight I will have to compensate.  I wrote a poem finally today as my mind was in that state. Enjoy.   Deprivation  Not a moment to spare, Never the time to waste, Wishing time could stand still, Wanting a moment to replace,  Withholding life's pleasures, Letting go of the pain, Strict effort and integrity, Allow me the world to gain,  An impact of relation, A worthless tone of hate, Grief and existence are continous, Next to nothing to refer to as great,  Wrath of wisdom's ways, Bliss of knowledge's power, Caring too much about it all, If not equal, then a coward  Lonesome deep at heart, Depths of a soulful ill, Pain is state of mind, Love is what fulfills.
