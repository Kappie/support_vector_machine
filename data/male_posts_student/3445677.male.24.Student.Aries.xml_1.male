A la the retro inspired late nineties.  Now, cycles have their ups and their downs.  What is most important to remember is that while some pieces inevitably become stuck in one period while other forms receive little jiggles as they pass through a cycle.  Crack pants (those low cut jeans that took the hip out of hipsters and revealed inordinate amounts of female plumbers crack to the entire population - while a hint of nudity is good, a hint of arse crack is not attractive) have been and are going, forever stuck in the arse end of the nineties.  But the suit, it's a stayer.  What a man needs in a suit is longevity.  Suits cost money so what you want is something classical, something that is going to prove you are a style guru during any particular fashion period.    First of all, I would recommend cufflinks.  Cufflinks give your suit a flavour of old world know how.  Yes, buttons are more convenient but cufflinks tell people that you have an eye for detail.  Cufflinks are a way of individualizing your suit.  Buttons are impersonal and boring.  Also, you will find that a cufflinked shirt sleeve is more comfortable on the wrist.  The cufflink holds the edges of the cuff outward so that the wrist only ever encounters smooth fabric.  Of course, the button does not work in quite the same way.  Any good jeweler is going to stock a credible range of cufflinks in a range of prices.  Understated is the way to go - simple silver, or gold without a great deal of flashy gemstones.  If the gemstone design is simple and understated, then by all means purchase and wear.  You want to avoid a garish display of colour and light that is going to distract attention.  The art of the cufflink is one of a subtle rounding off.  The cufflink is not the focal point of the suit, nor should it be a major highlight.  The very best cufflinks fly under the radar, people see them and recognize that you are a man of style and substance without being slapped in the face with your obvious style acumen.  Cufflinks also make good family heirlooms.  By passing them on you ensure that another generation of men will by masters of style.  Cufflinks give a suit that retro but upmarket feel.  So, avoid the impersonal, inhuman, mass-produced button and opt instead for the personal, individual cufflink.  That wink of silver or gold from the wrist that whispers of class.  That wink of silver or gold from the wrist that whispers of comfort.  That wink of silver or gold that whispers of a man who knows about style and has an unerring eye for detail.  Remember, comfort is not everything.  Price is not everything.  Looking good is everything.
