Well I'm going to probably fall asleep about 4 so that means 4 hours of sleep, I think I might be spending a fair amount of my recent paycheck to keep me awake at work and the hours following, cause who wants to fall asleep their first night in Madison at 9!?  Looks like the site is getting some people looking at it, keep reading, trust me, all three of us will have very interesting stories to contribute as the semester goes on.  Well time to get some sleep before I have to deal with the emotional baggage that my mom is sure to bring tomorrow.
