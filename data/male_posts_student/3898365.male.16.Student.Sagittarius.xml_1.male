A pleasant reward for doing well in class methinks.    Dude, for once, Netflix has let me down. And they let me down  hard . I mentioned how I received  Pee Wee's Big Adventure  in yesterday's post, did I not? Well, I went to take it out of the patented Netflix sleeve to watch it when I got home from class and, Oup! It was cracked. The DVD. There is a big crack going halfway across the DVD. I guess it was bound to happen eventually, that an ordered specimen would be smashed by the mail-people, but did it have to happen to Pee Wee? God, I mean... he was so young.    It's so hot... So hot... And Amy got air conditioning... She's so lucky... So lucky.    School is out for me now! Today was really easy. Mr. Gilford brought us donuts and orange juice to drink when we arrived. We cleaned up the room all nice and pretty and organized our notebooks that were to be turned in after the final. For the final we went out to a park on Eagle Creek, because some of the questions required us to be outside around trees and a stream. We all scattered around this play structure area -some were on swings, some were on slides, some were on monkey bars- and worked on the really simple final test. Not that we really needed to, but Gilford let us use our notebooks and all the handouts we received to look up information on the final. Seriously, I wish I had him for a teacher longer.    Jenny freaked me out for a little bit. She was having a stomach ache and it looked like it was really hurting her. But you know what? That didn't stop her from saving some kid's life. Okay, maybe he wasn't going to die, but she saved him from getting scratched up. There was this kid -five years old, as he would later tell us- jumping up and down on the really thin branches of this tree a ways away from where our class was. He was yelling, too. Not urgent "Help me!" yelling, just sort of "Hey, look, I'm in a tree! I want attention for my god-like feat!" yelling. After a couple minutes of that, Stephanie and Kristin walked over to see if he needed help getting down. After about ten seconds of them talking to him, Jenny stood up (we were sitting in the shade over by the playground) and started running over to the kid, and seriously, right when she stood up, the kid fell about three feet on to some lower branches.    Like a superhero, she jumped through the branches over to the trunk of the tree and helped the little guy down on to safe ground. Turns out his parents owned the campground, or something, so I'm sure he was used to being up in trees.    It was cool.    After we finished up the final we headed back to the school. Gilford told us that if we wanted to, we could go to the computer lab and have everyone enter a CRLE for the course. It means Career Related Learning Experience, and our school district requires two of them before a student can graduate. So, dude, I only have to do one more CRLE. Awe-some.    Then my dad drove Jenny home. Then we went home. Then I napped. Then I stabbed my neighbor. Now I'm typing.    My parents just left and my mom told me not to have any parties or do any happy dancing while they're gone. No really, she actually said that. "No happy dances." Sorry guys, I know you were looking forward to that.
