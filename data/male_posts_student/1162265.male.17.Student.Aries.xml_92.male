Never having had a recurring dream (not nightmare) it has kind of disturbed me.  Last Nights dream was the strangest, since the person in it actually ended up seeming more like Devon/Rene(Two cousins) then who they were supposed to be.  I'm assuming I had this dream, which I don't want to elaborate on, because I went to sleep around 9 on a Saturday which is extremely early for me, and didn't get up until 9 today.  It was pretty weird, I've been pretty anti-Christian for the past few days and today I really just didn't want to be dragged to church.  Fortunately I wasn't, so instead I could waste my day at home.  Great trade off.   I've been really feeling strange for the last three days, and I have no clue why.  Probubly those dreams have something to do with it, but they are usually a reflection of something I'm already thinking of or that is weighing down on my mind.  But why now and not months ago?
