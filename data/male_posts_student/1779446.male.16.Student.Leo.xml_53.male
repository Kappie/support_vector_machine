We also started a group blog...  http://kudosincarnate.franktherabbit.net  Quite cool, it's basically a group blog with me, Andrew, Matt (who is also the gracious host), Dennis, and Ray. We're managing to sound not only pretentious but arrogant! Alrighty... I guess that is it! Visit that blog!  I'm not really in blogging mode so yeah... maybe some other time readers. Sorry.  Cheers.  Colin.
