She had the microphone on so I can hear it. Anywho, we were listening to it and there was a girl who was 16 on there saying she was a bisexual and he was saying (the pastor on the liveprayer thing) the bisexuality doesn't exist.. etc. etc. and you would pay the consequences (in a nutshell, he said change your ways or burn in hell) and rambled. Anyways, I had my webcam on and she said "George, you should call in".. so, i've done stuff like this before when we tried to get pedophile phone numbers and call them and screw with their heads. LMAO... anyway, she gave me the number and I kept hanging up and hitting redial till it was answered. The first two times, I was hung up on and at one point the person answering the phones said I was up next. Then it hung up on me. Then right at the end of the show, the pastor answered and went "the show is over, aight?" and then someone called back from there and I answered and they hung up on me. Weird. That was funny as shizzleeeeee. I want to try it again tonight (the show airs every night with all these screwed up people calling in wanting to pray"... but what was also funny was that the pastor was saying homosexuality led to drug and alcohol abuse and your life would be bad and you'd be confused. Then he told that 16 year old girl on the line that gays commit suicide and do drugs more. I mean... who cares. As long as they are happy with life.  By the way. Being a democrat, I am pro-gay rights because I believe people should have more options in life and they shouldn't follow a "you can't do that!" type of life. Do as you please unless you are hurting another... it should be your choice to have these freedoms. Anti-abortionists piss me off sometimes like that. I mean, yes, I feel, being a vegan, everything should have the chance to live, but if Jim Bob pulls you off the street and forces you to have sex with him and rapes you and you find out your pregnant with the baby of some fucked up loser who couldn't care less, what would you do? The baby didn't do anything wrong. But say you're 14,15,16,17.... around there.... would you want to give birth to it? I sure as hell wouldn't want to. The thought of having your own child is scary enough as it is.   The power went out last night at 4 while I was talking to shelly and I usually keep a red flashlight next to the pencil cup on my desk just in case it ever happens and my dad moved it into the kitchen. So I dug around in the dark... holding a $1,500 guitar... afraid i'm going to run into the wall with it or drop it. I stepped on a quill tipped pen (that felt great) and fell down the stairs waking everyone up when I went upstairs to get the emergancy lantarn and down to the basement, I tripped over my mom's sandals while getting candals and batteries..... then the lighters wouldn't work because they were outside in the rain. Then I found my dad's windless glow lighter thing outside on the floor of the porch... I stayed up till 4ish. Then I awoke to the power being on (yay). I'm going to see Styx, Peter Frampton, and Nelson in concert tomorrow night at the virginia beach verizon wireless amphitheatre. I have 6th row seats in the gold circle reserved area. So.. yay for me. My dad saw styx in 1976.
