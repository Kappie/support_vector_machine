And i just write about what happenesd. sometimes a stupid critic or two, and if i write poetry then im either high on oxygen or im a tad depressed or maybe i need to stick a pencil up my nose. yeah. well anyways i was reading this blog, by an old friend who i eventually came to call "asshole" lemme giveyou the link...   urlLink    and after reading it i found out how fucking full of shi* she is. i mean, shes always writing poems and stuff, using complex words that at some point actually impressed me. well im finally noticing that she always writes the same kind of poems. let me invent a poem that would not surprise me if it was hers. And no, I dont read the dictionary every day, or look up complex words, so this isnt really good.  "yeasterday i woke up coffee coffee coffee cup my aunt fucked up //then she needs a bad word in here... and my cunt went up."  thats stupid, i know, but its HER kind of poem. and it sucks a lot. hehe. arg i gotta get this head band off my head its going to kill  me, its too tight argh. done my mom and i agreed to wear a head band if i wanna keep my hair long. ugh. and she aint letting me dye my hair.  i woke up with a cold today. and it still hurts, my eyes hurt a lot. yeah. people should start to read blogs. they... they sorta tell you how to be, not who to follow, but how to act. youll notice the difference between a sloppy blog (ahem) and a well done blog  urlLink   yeah. i gotta start a proyect for tomorrow and so ive gotta finsh or ill probably fail hehe. Mr miller didnt like my animation. he didnt even laugh at rene! but ale did. mwhaha.ok i gotta work/sleep/eat cook-ays or something. I DONT WANNA WORK SAVE ME!  or maybe ill just read more blogs. i was also reading on vegan food recipes. and i cant use a headband. two more days and i dont have to see anyone from school for two months. which kicks ass.  i want a hockey mask.
