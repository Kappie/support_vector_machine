I had spent 2weeks with this stupid complex, overnighting several documents - over and over. I'm just really bummed out about it. I have a few applications out with other condo's and rental houses. I really hope this goes well. I feel sick.  I didn't go up to school yesterday or today. I just don't have it in me to think about studying or stupid cisco shit. Right now I need a place for my wife to live. :(  I washed Precious today, she was starting to smell like a big bag of Fritos. haha. And that doesn't make me very hungry. She is all super clean now. I even went to far and got naked and turned on the shower. I could pick her up easy and just hold her under the spray. It was easier to rinse her for sure.  I dunno what is going to happen. I really freaked out yesterday, i had two corona's and that calmed me down. After all the kicking and shouting I was pretty emotionally drained and super fucking slumped so i went to bed at 8:30pm. 12hours later I am up - i don't feel better.   !!!!!! F U C K !!!!!!!   current mood:  drained current music: nothing - my speakers are packed
