There I am, bored to death and stuffed with Easter ham, looking for some shit to do, things to demolish, stuff like that... :D Since I managed to suck out some money from my "dad", I decided to tank some fresh unleaded into my Trinity and make a cruise in a virtually deserted city of Zagreb. Puttin' some clothes on (being just in my underwear) I manage to drop my cigarette almost igniting my damn carpet... It now strikes me that I should've looked at the signs before undertaking the adventure of cruising. ;) Well anyway, I got into Trin, pushed a freshly burned AudioCD into my player, opened the sunroof and pressed the damn pedal with just three simple letters on it:  G .. A .. S . Gettin' to the gas station took 'round 10 minutes at an average speed of 55mph, which isn't that bad considering there were still some idiots on the road. I got my petrol and headed out to annoy some people, as well as to look for cops to pull me over and ask me if I was drinking anything. :D Now why does this sound so weird to you? :p ...well, I don't recall the last time I was pulled over for ANY reason; since I got Trinity cops seem to ignore me, no matter how fast I drive. o_O oK, so I head out to Spansko (part of Zagreb) 'cause I know they're out there somewhere... *BINGO* - I spotted them, but they were stationed opposite of my direction. DAMN! ... Ah well, I decided to make a U turn after a couple of miles and scratch their balls a bit later. I got lost in time, didn't realize half an hour passed... "time to get those cops...", or so I thought... The blue fucks left by the time I got back! *grrr*  I've listened the whole damn CD through and got bored, so I decided to go home to get some old coffee and prepare myself for nightmares I'm going to dream... So there I am, completely relaxed, both front windows down, smoking a cigarette, lookin' at some drunk women passing by lookin' completely stupid, when all of a sudden a FUCKIN' CAT comes running out of nowhere! oK, so she's after my Trinity's pussy or something, or she just wanted to check the tire's pressure. *boom, bang, miyauuuuuuuuuuuuuuu...* - the cat got busted! :D Now let me tell you, it was  LOUD ! "poor Trinity", I screamed; I had to pull over and take a look at potential damage done to her... I don't want to sound insensitive, but the cat asked for it; why the fuck did she have to run under a speeding car, with absolutely no damn chance of stopping and letting her highness cross the road?! ...and since there was a moron in a car behind me licking my car's ass, there was no fucking way I was to brake!  I pulled over and took a look... oK, no major damage done, just some torn plastic and shit. *phew*. I strolled back to the "crime scene" to check everything out and found her dead, without any blood around, took a bag and pulled her off the road. I also took some pictures with my cell phone, but I'm not going to publish them.  I think all of this proves how much I love cats! LMAO! ...but still, there's a philosophical approach to all of this, being Easter and all... I'll post those thoughts in  urlLink voice from within  once I get my thoughts organized.  ...and that, my dears, concludes the story of my short cruise...  Be good now, and stroke your kittens if you have any! ;)
