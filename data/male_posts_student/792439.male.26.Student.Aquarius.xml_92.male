The real battle has not started yet.’  — MESSAGE PURPORTEDLY BY AYMAN AL-ZAWAHRI" check my entry for  urlLink sept. 11  : "mark my words...this was only a test. the terrorists are probing our weaknesses. they have exposed to the world how easy it is to strike on our home soil." speaking of armageddon....we saw 28 days later. go see this movie. it is intense. i think my muscles were tensed up during the whole first half of the film. whew. i actually lost my composure for a second when the dude tries to open a car door, in the beginning. the lead actress is a serious badass! it's eerie how accurate the events unfold. oh, and the cinematography makes me drool. the shot compostions lead not only your eyes around the frame, but also your mind. there are a couple of strange personal psychological interactions with the images on the screen (like the director knows what you are thinking) combined with the audio. one scene in particular, the entire audience was mumbling and discussing a ghostly face in the top left corner of a view of a sunsetting horizon. the pacing of tthe scenes is impeccable. just as your teeth begin to grind from the sound of a rattling cage, the screen goes black, and the sound mercifully ends. i felt like i was on a ride through most of the movie. yeah.
