Since, after all, you don't all reply to emails (coughaustincough) and I forgot some email addresses (coughconnorcough) I thought this could be the best way to keep in touch right now, since this time tomorrow I may not have internet connection at Ernesto y Adri's.  Costa Rica has got to be one of the most beautiful places in the world. Okay, now that we have the setting down. lol anyway, right now I'm staying with Suzie and Michele. They have got to be some of the biggest sweethearts God ever made. Honestly. Anyway, I think the 2 biggest things that have happened so far are these.  On Wednesday (I think) I gave my testimony to an evangelism group from the youth group that Michele is working with. See, Natalie and I had to sit in on the meeting (I understood like half of what was going on). And they were learning how to write testimonies and give them. So Michele had already helped me write mine out and asked me to give it. So I did. It was really cool except I was sooo nervous that I couldn't get the word mia out. First it came out mio and then miaeee and then they all laughed when I finally got it to mia. lol and then later I couldn't say involucrada, becuase that word and I just have issues. So this one guy who said nothing the rest of the night, I was like 'involcr... no involucrud' and he goes 'involucrada' and i was like 'si!' and then kept going. lol it was funny. And then they all clapped and cheered afterwards. I'm still working on whether they were happy for me (cause they said 'amen' when I said I want to be 'una misionera por que yo quiero compartir el amor de Jesucristo con otras personas) or if they cheered cause they were happy I was done. lol  Then I was talking with Suzie about the 'illegals' which are Nicaraguans. I never knew that Nicaragua was having such a  hard time, but apparently they are. So I asked if there was an I-Team down there, and Suzie said no. But this other girl Maribela wants to go down there and start one but she needs someone to go with her, you know? And I was thinking about it a lot lately (which means in the past 3 days) that maybe this is what I want to do. THey don't need me here, they're already well established. But they need people for Nicaragua. And even though I couldn't go for another six years cause of school, I could spend summers helping Maribela prepare to go down there. I could come to Costa Rica for a year of school and work with her to plan it. You know? But then, I'm not sure if this is just me thinking of all of this, or if it's God showing me what His will is for my future. So I've been praying about it. I almost want to do the whole Gideon and sheepskin thing, but I don't want to be like testing God, I just want to know for sure so I don't screw up some vast eternal plan.  Anyway, those are the big things that have happened. Email me. You all have the address.  Working on my spanish, sara  ps, bring something for the rain.
