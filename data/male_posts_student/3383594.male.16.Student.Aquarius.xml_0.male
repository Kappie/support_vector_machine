L0L, which is pretty unbelieveable as I've been failing my Chinese. I can't even remember when was the last time I passed it. But the fact is tt I can actually pass it as I managed to get a 48% for the mid-yr exams without studying.  I'm juz wishing for the best and stuffs. I'm juz telling myself tt I can do it and tt Chinese isn't tt tough after all. Haha, I actually look forward to tomorrow's Chinese paper cus I wanna get it over wif and start the June Holidays, which is gonna be a blast! I've basically plan out wad I'll be doing already.  1. Study! 2. Tuition twice a wk, 2hrs each time for A Maths. 3. Make my Geog, SS and FNN notes. 4. Swim at least twice a wk to get darker! 5. Play pool at least twice a wk too juz for the fun of it. 6. Spend quality time wif certain ppl. 7. Go out, relax and chill. 8. Go for a short holiday.  So, tt's basically it. I'll definitely be spending lots of time on the first 4. I'll probably onli go out if I'm extremely bored or if some1 gifs me a ring and ask me out, which I hope happens cus I dun wanna stay at home everi single day! L0L! Well, so if u guys wanna go out or smt, u can always gimme a ring ya? I'll be here for u always! L0L! Alrite, tt's about it for today. Gd luck for tmr's paper to every1 who is taking it. Chill. =]
