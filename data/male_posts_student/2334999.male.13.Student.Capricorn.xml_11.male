I'd rather be sitting in the hot sun at the tennis courts and watching the parade and the SCDF wadeva-performance thingy than WORK WORK WORK... First of all, we T.Club people had to go and record the entire parade on the Canon MVI700i or something like that (courtesy of Canon)...  We watched the whole boring parade from lvl 3/4 and lvl 5... Then halfway, that was when things started to go wrong... Our camcorder ran out of battery... Daniel and KJ ran all the way down to the D studio (4/5 stories) to get the DC adapter, after running all the way back up again, we realised that they grabbed the wrong one lol... Then they ran all the way back down to get the correct one which they did... They connected it to the water cooler socket and we only managed to record bits n pieces of the parade from a weird angle (due to the length of the adapter wire) and even then, from the position which we were recording, people had to limbo past the taut wire to get past us lol... Most of the time, Daniel was recording the parade. But with great luck, I was the one who recorded those who fainted in the parade :D We also had 2 camera crews (clifford n daniel seet) who went around taking pics of the UYOs...  Right after that, we all went back down to the D studio. Whee, finally! Aircon!!! Some say that greatest invention!  Back there, we were all wrapping up everything... Charging the horribly pathetic batteries and compiling the pictures. N Mr See was like damn pissed, ticking us off and scolding the others... Somebody woke on the wrong side of bed today... Mr see wanted us to save the pics in the CF Cards to a CD... Leonard went to get the laptop but we could not use it because of the OS (Win98) which needed drivers for it to work... After lotsa crap (connecting the laptop to the internet to download the driver, then downloading the latest windows Service Pack), it didnt work in the end... What a bloody waste of time! Sheesh! We then used the D studio's computers (which were windows XP) and we managed to get it done... We=Daniel Lee  Daniel Seet  Me... Haha, 2 Daniels sandwiching me :p  Ok, so after that, we had like 1 and a half hrs to burn... We went to Waffle Town for lunch and we saw Michael See n his wife!!! Haha, what luck!!! Then we bought lunch for leonard and KJ...  After they finished eating, we had to get ready for the Time Capsule thingy... Haha, armed with my A80, I started taking pictures of that gaping hole in the ground where the time capsule was supposed to be placed it... And guess what, the time capsule was SQUARE...A square in a circle -.- sheesh... Then the VIPs and guests started coming in... I was supposed to 'shoot' them signing the guest list and I dinnoe it was upstairs, at the drama theatre... Haiz...  After that, it was damn blardee hectic... I went around shooting pics, then running down to get them printed then back again... Then everyone started to crowd around the time capsule area while the guests and principals were 'checking' out the stuff that they were going to put inside the time capsule... While 'shooting' those guests, my frickin camera ran out of juice!!! Arghhhhh!!! So I ran all the way down to get whatever I shot printed... Since there was no battery, KJ borrowed Clifford's batteries to get mine printed... omg... Did it feel like eternity! We printed and printed and printed... The stupid printer took so damn blardee long to print out each photo! It really felt like some newsroom! Mrs Tan was rushing us to print out the photos that were just taken to put into the time capsule... Since my photos were 'outdated', Mr See made me take more pictures of the blardee event... They were already sealing up the blardee time capsule which I had to snap pics of... So much rushing around... Bah! Im just glad its over... We still had to come to school tomorrow for a debrief(saturday)! Of course im not going! Why should I come to school just for 20 blardee minutes and go home right after that... HELL NO, MAN! And I'm also to go for the 2.4km run retest but of course, im not going... Hey! I mean im so damn tired after today, and its a SATURDAY damit... Saturdays are for sleeping till noon! And now, im like typing all this just for the helluvit...Even tho im so bloody tired... A'well...Good nite guys
