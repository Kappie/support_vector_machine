First, we drove down into the D.C. area, I was unconscious most of the way down and don't remember anything until we parked the car, we went down this way to go to the viewing of Ronald Regan's casket, so after we parked the car we, my dad and two brothers (no girls this trip), took the shuttle over to the line waiting to get in the capitol and began our waiting process about 10 till 2 in the morning. The line went all the way to the end of the mall and took us 5 1/2 hours make our way through, so it was about 7:30 when we finally got into the Rotunda. After that exciting experience (I have to admit that was probably a once in a lifetime opportunity) we headed to Ocean City, Maryland. It was raining and cold when we arrived, but we swam anyways, then came back to the hotel zoned out in front of the T.V. for a while and then went to eat at the original Phillips Seafood restaurant. Very Good.  The next day was warmer and the surf was up so we went swimmingthen we went parasailing which is a once in a lifetime thing too. After that we went to Asitiuge(?) and swam some there, and then we headed home and came back later Saturday night. All in all it was a fun trip.  urlLink My Homepage
