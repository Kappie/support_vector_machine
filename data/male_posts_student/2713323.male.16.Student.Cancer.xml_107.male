Its (i haven figured out whether its male or female) name is  Gucci  . Yeah, my sis named it, brah, after all it was her bf that found it flying inside his room. oh well, its yellow and has a streak of green on it. woah, today was very....fun. dunno why, me kel ryan was all in a reasonably good mood. damn right kel, should do this more often. :D. oh yeah, before i leave, a quote my dad told me today.  "if theres a problem, solve it. if you cant solve it, then theres no problem at all, why bother about it?"
