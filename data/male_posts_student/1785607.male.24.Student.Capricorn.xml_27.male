Occasionally you take a bath, a nice warm one; then you get ready for a night of endless hours. Sit at the edge of bed, is everything in the place it should be? Pillows, sheet, quilt? Have you turned the lights off already? No? Why not? Oh! Because you know it's no point. Well, look at the floor, see all those remote controls? Should you do it? Do it, I mean, is there anything else to do?   There you are, TV surfing, but there's nothing to see, just infomercials that try to sell you useless stuff. Why someone would need some of stuff? Sunglasses, the mega speed reading, kitchen gadgets, and so and so. And after an hour or more of that idiotic programming you feel so numb. Pop on a video, or a DVD, or listen some music, that seems a better idea. But how many times have you seen the same video? And answer this: have you turned the lights off already? I knew it!  There you are sitting at the edge of your bed, or maybe moving from one side to the other, but always with the same exhausting feeling. So now you stand up. Walk in the room. What's that? You think if you ate something you'll get in the mood. Ok let's try that. Go to the kitchen, open the fridge. Is there anything you would like? Nah, I thought so! But hey, maybe a nice warm glass of milk should do the trick, everyone says so. But you know it never works, don't you? I know, you will try it anyway. Let's go back to the bedroom.  There you are, a glass of milk in your hand, maybe, some cookies or even a sandwich, a peanut butter and jelly one to go with, and again the TV's on. Look around, do you see something to do? No? But I bet you can think of something to do. I know! Working out. You think of that every night. You will be thinking it for at least an hour, and like every other night, you won't do it. See the time, man Is late! So late already, or maybe early, well it all depends on the point of view. But tell me, have you turned the lights off?  There you are, you already ate and drank, thought about doing some exercise but nothing works. What else could you do? And still sitting in bed, uh? Turn your head to the night's table. Do you see it? The same old book that you always try to read but never do. It is even in the same page like the last three times, not because you don't want to read it, but because you always have to start again. Could it work this time? Want to try it? Ok, let's give it a try. Oh man! You will finally turn off the lights! Big step let me tell you, big step!  There you are, at night, with the night's lamp on, in bed, and with a book on your hands. You don't even remember the names of the characters, and maybe, and I said maybe, you don't remember the plot; but it doesn't matter as long as you have something to do. Are you reading or are you thinking? You are thinking about him? I bet you are thinking about him and everyone else, all those people that are asleep, even the ones that are awake. What he might be doing? Not thinking about you, that's for sure!  There you are, thinking in bed, and again, the book's in the floor in the same page and waiting to be picked up tomorrow night. Now, what are you thinking? About how the hell will you sleep if you don't even really try to? Well, ok, do it. Try to sleep. Lye there, put your head on the pillow, close your eyes. Is he holding you in your thoughts?  Why aren't you sleeping? Don't cry, time has passed already. Yeah I know, your head is not an easy thing to turn off. Try it anyway. All is peace, even though you are not asleep, even though you ache for him. Can you hear you breathing? Can you feel the movement of your chest going up and down? How peaceful and quiet.  There you are, lying in bed, eyes closed and almost asleep. What's that? Can you hear it? Oh, and in your face? What's that? Believe or not, the sound is the one of birds, they are chirping, and that in your face is the morning's sunlight. You've been up all night. Are you tired? You are supposed to be ready to go in a few hours. Why are you turning around? Are you going to try to sleep? Have you stopped thinking about him? He did hurt you didn't he? He did break your heart? Have you turned the night's lamp off? Try to sleep, morning's coming.
