I do my Psychology final tomorrow, my Spanish 4(hehe failed that one already)and Contemporary Issues finals on Wednesday, my Journalism and Tech finals on Thursday, and my English and Concert Chorus finals on Friday. FUN!   On Sunday, I gave a small "sermonette", I guess you could call it, and I got a great approval rating from it. The only person who frequents this site at all that heard the sermonette is Ruth Fox. (Hmm, I wonder what she thought of it...) I used some of my own personal testimony to back up my point, and used some of  urlLink Newsboys  front man Peter Furler's testimony too. I see him on the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) on ATF TV done by  urlLink Acquire The Fire (ATF)  and Ron Luce, head of Teen Mania Ministries, sponsor of Acquire The Fire (ATF).   The service yesterday (Sunday) was our graduation service, and my sermonette was on taking God with you with you wherever you go, to live for Him, and to have the strong relationship with Him that He wants to have with you. When Peter gives his testimony, it comes from the heart because he made a lot of mistakes that he doesn't want any other Christian teenager to have to make. Those who know me well know that I made me own small mistakes before that I am not proud of. That was part of my personal testimony. I told the church about how I used to be into pornography two and three years ago, and though the temptation is still there, I hold strong against it. I also told them about how I used to smoke, for a short time, and recently quit.   I'm not proud of my past, and I'm actually pretty ashamed of it, but God was speaking and told me to use it to further my point. Not only were they glad to hear an honest testimony (which in Christian circles, is still hard to come by), but glad to hear a strong challenge for all ages, to live the way God would have you to live, and have that strong relationship with Him. It was a lot of fun, spiritually uplifting for everyone, and the church (full of people I've known all my life and have grown very close with) got to learn more about the me they never saw. It was great, and I would gladly do it again.  Also, Colin, if you read this, E-mail me or IM me sometime and remind me: I have a somewhat large online project (that is fun) I would like to endeavor that I might need your help on if you're willing and have some time on your hands. It may be more than I can handle in a short time.  Well, that's all for now! Blog ya later! Comment me!  In Christ, Mike >
