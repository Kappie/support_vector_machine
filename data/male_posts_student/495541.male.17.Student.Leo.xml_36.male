More than a normal day but there's stuff I could have done instead of just sitting here doing nothing.  I went to Best Buy and got some new Sony headphones.  They're the kind that go behind your head.  I like 'em they're cool.  They sort of hurt my ear though.  I think I might be wearing them wrong.  I also got the new Moby CD '18'  It's pretty good.  That's about it for now.
