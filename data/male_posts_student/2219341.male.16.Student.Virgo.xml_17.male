L just comes out and says "hey kristopher" right when she saw me.  she probably doesnt know how good that made me feel.  just the fact that she was happy to see me.  or when ashley made a little hand stiched thingy!  that made me feel good that she did that for me.  yanno i like it when somebody notices me without me havin to try to be noticed.  like when someone just says hi and just starts talkin to me cuz THEY wanted to.  they thought about me and thought i was important enough to talk to.  makes me feel wanted.  its a great feeling.
