It pulled out when it realized I was driving too slow (120) and was bumper to bumper with the black truck. the green car tried to pull in front of me as soon as it could and missed my bumper by about six inches. At that point he lost control and slammed straight into the barrier to my right, bouced off that, hit the barrier to my left then cartwheeled on that barrier three times, snapping off a wheel that I dodged around. The whole thing took about eight seconds. The guy actually got out and started to throw a tantrum, so instead of stopping to help him, headed for the copshop around the corner. Saw a cop on the way, told her and followed her back to the scene. The guy had fled the scene.  Tonight sucked a lot. I should have stayed in bed. To top it all off I feel even worse.  I can't wait until they catch him. The other cop - the O.P.P. lad they called, Officer Thomas - he took names and numbers. I'm itching to have a chat with this chap. Fucker nearly killed me. *rage*
