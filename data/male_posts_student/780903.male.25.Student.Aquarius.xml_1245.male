One of the items on the line were miniature bagels, on a platter with some smoked salmon.  So I took a bagel, and a piece of salmon.  And I get to the table, and I open the bagel.  And it was pre-cream-cheesed.  They had already put cream cheese on the bagels.  Astonishing.  This is how good they treat us.  They put cream cheese on our bagels for us.  Amazing.  (Is that what paralegals do?)
