One of the best reality show things I've seen in a long time. Then again I larve reality shows, mainly Survivor and Big Brother though. BB is my summer guilty pleasure, which starts by the way.  Speaking of summer... It starts soon. Eleven weeks of glorious weather and no school. The latter and former can battle out for the most important feature of summer. But it also means that job looking WILL commense. I  really  need a job; sure I've given out a few resumes but none have been.. Followed up on. Bah at my town. It sucks though RE post secondary school. I honestly think that it should be free for everyone. It isn't fair to be charging kids tens of thousands of dollars for school, and then people wonder why we're greedy... It's 'cause we need all the freaking money we can get after school to survive! I hate the fact that while we're in high school, students are forced to get part time jobs to raise money for post secondary school, while the jobs interfere with high school marks which, essentially are the only things that can get us to post secondary school. Think about it, you walk up to a university and say "Hey! I have $20,000! Sign me up!" They'll say "Ok... Lets see your marks... Wow... You failed everything. I think we'll pass." "But I have the money!" That is how it'll be. All post secondary schools need to be nuked.  Seacrest, OUT!
