Anyhoo, I'm still here, though nothing much to say, I did a Hampshire Collage science camp, called  urlLink "CSI" (camp science investigators)  and just finished up with a vacation from a beach in Watch Hill Rhode Island. Hopefully I'll get some photos up and running, but I'm not sure whether to trust flickr or not, so I'll have two decide.  Anyway, our puppy still isn't doin' too hot, but hopefully she'll get better, we think it might have been a urinary tracket infection, so we'll see.........  See ya'll 'round, I'll post again, as soon as my life becomes interesting!!!! :(
