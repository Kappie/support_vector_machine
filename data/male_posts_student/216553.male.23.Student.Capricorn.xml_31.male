Here's some interesting statistics about what I should anticipate during residency:   Average Starting Age of Residents: 26.5  Average Length of Residency: four years  Average Hours Per Week: 80  Average Educational Debt: $100,000  Average Salary Range: $38,500-49,000   Average Length of Training:  Pediatrics — three years  Internal Medicine — four years  General Surgery — five years  Otolaryngology (Head/Neck) — six years  Neurosurgery — seven years   And yes, at this point, I'm considering neurosurgery! Ack!
