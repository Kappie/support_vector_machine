I saw a bunch of people I haven't seen in a while or ever. I saw a relative of mine who is a missionary up in Canada, that I've heard a lot about and never seen. I've seen some cousins that are about my age which I've never seen.A lot of funny Dutch accents flying in the wind and truly awesomeDutch foodon the table (I didn't know we had so many kinds of meat). Of course, I didn't talk to them, but baby steps, people; you're talking to a man that has periods of completenothingness.   My brother got a car on Ebay. What should I be feeling? Envy? Desire? Interest? Nadda. Maybea little happiness, just in being around such a beautiful work of art (that is what a car is) and maybe a little pleasure divined from my brother's overwhelminghappiness. But almost nothing. Cars are important things. I feel great freedom and worry and caution when I consider my own car (sidenote: I got flipped off for the first time. Not that much fun, that motherfokkin aoss [aren't fake swearwords fun?]). But this thing evokes nothing.
