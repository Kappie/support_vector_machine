Have you seen or spoken to Claire at all this time we've had off? =/ Do you even care? *pulls out the notepad* ... Soooo, where'd it come from? You just decided one day.. oh I'll write about love? About love that you haven't told someone about, about the love you've left for some obscure reason... WHERE'D IT COME FROM? I DEMAND ANSWERS! Mwahahaha, I'm nice really. =)   *sighs* I'm not sure I'll get the answers I'm looking for, I don't even know what I'm looking for... lalalallaalalala - rambling.. *consciously makes an effort to stop*...*STOPS*
