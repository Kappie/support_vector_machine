TOI is a near Monopoly in Mumbai , while The Hindu dominates Madras (Chennai) , Delhi has a tough Competition between TOI  HT while Calcutta has the Telegraph  Statesman .                             I have been observing a paradigm shift in news reporting both in Newspapers  in Magazines over the last few years. I am not too sure if its the changing times but the News is increasingly focussing on Glamour  glitter than on actual content. There is very less fodder for the Intellect  more for the eyes in glamour photos  P3P's. More on this later . But its definitely time to Ponder ........
