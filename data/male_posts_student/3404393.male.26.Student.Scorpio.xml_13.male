There was a Harvard University study done on some healthy, independent seniors on what kind of effect positive/negative words had on their physical state of being.  They were tested with some sort of video game where positive or negetive words were flashed on the screen for a predetermined amount of time, but not long enough for it to register consciously.  The result?  The seniors exposed to positive words walked an average of 10% faster than their regular speed.  Huh...amazing...  Oh yeah, the senior exposed to negative words saw no change at all. I wondered at this, but the researcher said this was probably attributable to the fact that most seniors have a negative view of old age in general and are therefore less affected by the negative input.  Just thought that was interesting...
