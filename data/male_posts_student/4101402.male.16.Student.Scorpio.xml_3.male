Dad decides it's time for them to come down, as one tree is leaning toward our house, and the other is leaning towards the neighbors'. This tree felling was no easy task, however. Dad had to climb the tree with the chainsaw, cut branches as he went, then tie a huge-ass rope to it near the top. He then cut below the rope and had me pull the top of the tree down with the Jeep, as the other end of the rope was tied to the hitch.     After the top of the tree was down, Dad and I cut it up into smaller, more burnable pieces and dragged them down into the brush pile. Once that was done, the process was repeated for a second time. After 5 hours of labor, the tops of both trees are gone, but the large trunks still remain. That's tomorrow....       Why do I hate trees? Not because of all the work involved in cutting the bastards down, it's the fact that they seemingly have a personal vendetta against me. When we were dragging the limbs to the pile, the entire tree top fell on me. All I heard was a loud cracking noise, then I tried to run away. However, I wasn't fast enough to keep the tree from slamming into my right shoulder. I got a few cuts and scratches, and it is a little sore. Damn tree, I didn't even cut it down, Dad did. From now on, the only time you'll see me hugging a tree is if I'm trying to shimmy up it to cut it to the ground. It wasn't SO bad, as our neighbor did help with the clean up. Unfortunately, he is 85 and could only do so much. He did let us use his lawn tractor and cart...as ours is of course dead.      On the subject of Murray...there will soon be a new Murray. Dad and I took the busted tractor to the Wal-Mart where we bought it and told them what happened with it. The guy drove it around for a little bit and could tell something was wrong, so he told us to leave it at Wal-Mart and he would call us when it was fixed. However, on the way home, the guy calls Dad and says that he will just give us a new mower. What the hell? Alright...whatever, I wasn't going to argue about it. But, we should have the new Murray tomorrow. I'll be sure to inform you all about the mower when we get it, as I'm sure you are all enthralled.    The day got better when I went down to my aunt's house and played PS2 with my cousin. We played some  Need for Speed: Underground  and  007 Nightfire . Then, when I got home, I continued working on "Fade to Black" by Metallica for the guitar. I've got the intro and intro solo pretty well. I can play the other parts, it's just a matter of fine tuning my movements to keep the pace. I'll have it soon.    Well, until next time, good night and have a pleasant tomorrow.
