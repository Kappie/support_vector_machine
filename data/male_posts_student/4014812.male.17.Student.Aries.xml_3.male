But i havent recieved the stuff they sent me yet so i guess they are gonna call me back in like a couple days or so, so we can go over the courses and stuff.     Also today i told my grandparents that i wont be making it to Calgary this summer due to much difficultys in the past couple of days. Stupid Christians work and lack of money to purchase plane tickets. But thats ok... i think that my parents are planning for me to go out there for Christmas which will be absolutely awesome cause i havent been out there for Christmas for about 10 years.     My parents are going away this weekend.. so if anyone wants to doing anything *wink* *wink* tell me alright lol....    WES AND JAMES... we need to talk.. about this upcoming week cuz i need to know if we are going camping or not...     ok thats all for today :D...
