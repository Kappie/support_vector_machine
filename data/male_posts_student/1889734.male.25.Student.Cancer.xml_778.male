We decided we needed a bit of a break, and since Wednesday was our ten year anniversary, it seemed as good a time as any to get away for awhile.  You might be wondering why we chose Cleveland, land of the Burning River, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the ignoble Browns.    I wondered that as well, but then I recalled that my brother lives there, so we had the added bonus of being able to visit him, as well as get some decent tips about what to do in town.  Since our time was limited, we really didn’t do a whole lot, at least not the sort of whirling tour you would expect from a typical vacation.  Despite the relatively sedate time, I thought it was worth noting a few things that I found amusing.  We visited the  urlLink USS Cod  moored in downtown Cleveland.  The Cod is a WW II submarine that saw seven tours in the Pacific, with a fairly remarkable battle record.  The boat is  urlLink moored  at the waterfront, with easy parking and access.  As a WW II historical nut, I really looked forward to this.  And at only $6, it’s a real bargain.    The tour is self guided, and since it was a weekday early in the morning, Diane and I practically had the boat to ourselves.  The condition of the tour is what makes it so interesting.  The boat has not been altered to accommodate tourists.  Entry is gained through the forward hatch, climbing in through a cramped ‘airlock’, then down through the hatch on a thin metal ladder.  The opening is so tight, I had to force my shoulders through.  Once I left the ladder below decks, I had to stoop slightly to get enough headroom to move around in the  urlLink forward torpedo room.     I won’t bore you with the blow by blow details of each compartment, but if you want to view some quicktime movies, click  urlLink here.   Suffice to say that the crowding on the boat is unimaginable.  I didn’t bring a camera since I wasn’t sure it was permitted, but after being inside the boat, I realized it wouldn’t have mattered.  I wouldn’t be able to get a coherent picture, since the subject of any picture would be too close to achieve proper focus.  I tried to imagine what these guys experienced as I shuffled along in this tiny little boat, bumping my head, knees and elbows with almost any movement.  90 men lived in a space unfit for half that number, and fought a war while doing so.    I wonder how they got around the boat with their enormous testicles in the way.  If you are ever in the Cleveland area, take an hour and go see the Cod.  You won’t regret it.  Next stop was  urlLink The Cleveland Museum of Art.   There were two primary reasons to go to the museum – 1) it isn’t something we usually do, and 2) it was free.  I put aside my entire ‘pay as you go philosophy’ for the moment and knowingly leeched from the taxpayer to go stare at  objects du’art  for a few hours.  I wasn’t really sure what we were getting in to here, but it turned out to be an enjoyable time.  The museum self guided tour started us out in the lower level, full of art from ancient Asia and India.  There’s something about antiquity that draws me in, and I’m willing to stare at about anything if you tell me it is four or five thousand years old.  The museum had no problems providing suitable moments where I could witness the creaking bones of time.  The most remarkable thing I saw was a five thousand year old clay pot, delicate and shapely, adorned with a spiral glaze pattern that looked quite modern.  I tried to imagine the circumstances that allowed it to survive 50 centuries without any significant damage.  I’m surprised some drunken Asiatic potentate hadn’t smashed it over the head of a clumsy slave, shortly before having him impaled for spilling tea.    We moved on through a vast collection of stone Buddhas in various states of decay.  Arranged properly, they would make a good Paleolithic animation of the ravages of leprosy, if one walked along quickly.  After the fifth statue, my respectful pauses to soak up the age and craftsmanship of each work degenerated to bare glances with a murmer – “Bhudda, Bhudda, Bhudda, Vishnu, Vishnu, yeah, okay…”  I think art appreciation requires small doses to be effective.  Next came various displays of Japanese art, running up until the Meiji era.  I’ve always loved Japanese art, especially the brush paintings, which are really designated as a Chinese style.  Whatever.  There’s something about Japan that has always interested me.  I appreciate how their culture values subtlety and understatement.  At least until they tried to grab the Pacific and we blew them to hell.  But we gave them Quality Control in exchange, and they turned out just fine.  There was one particular piece there that caught my imagination.  Upon entering the gallery, I was confronted with this massive  urlLink scroll painting  of a man who appeared to be in complete agony, yet with a dignified expression on his contorted face.  I also noted the proportions of the subject, thinking they looked very odd.  It turned out he suffered from gigantism, and stood over seven feet tall.  He was a samurai who turned to Sumo when he fell upon hard times.  As an added touch, the subject had placed his hand print on the canvas, just visible in the picture.  I can’t exactly explain the reason, but this portrait still sticks with me.  After this, the highlight of the museum, at least for me, was the Armor Court (a massive collection of European armor and arms dating from the 1200s through the 1600s), and the gallery of Baroque Art.  There’s just something about European art from this era, when they painted real people and real events as they imagined them appearing.  It is photo-journalism of the day, albeit at a much slower pace.  I could easily spend quite a few hours wandering in a place like this, feasting on the radiance of  urlLink this , or the transience of  urlLink this .    The gallery of modern art drove away any lingering desire to press on through my fatigue or hunger at this point.  I stared at a  urlLink Jackson Pollack  for a few moments, trying to understand what people see in the swirling mass of dribs and drabs.  With any respect that might be due Mr. Pollack, I remain an ignorant savage.  I had much the similar experience with works such as  urlLink this large piece of graph paper , or  urlLink this...whatever .  One of the funnier observations was the caption that accompanied these  urlLink squares .   ” Largely a self-taught painter, Mark Rothko stopped painting recognizable objects in 1940 because he wanted to "create a new language of painting" that made no reference to the kinds of things people were used to seeing in pictures.   May I translate?  Mr. Rothko is a talentless hack who disguises his inability to paint with an unbridled pretentiousness.  Modern art gives art a bad name, and we should identify it for what it is.  Famished from a long day of submarine exploration and a properly snooty art experience, we decided to go have an early dinner/late lunch at the Cheesecake Factory.  If you have not yet dined at the Cheesecake Factory, I strongly recommend you take the time to do so.  The food is really quite remarkable, and the portion sizes are simply ridiculous.  When our waitress brought our entrees to our table, I was immediately thankful that I had ordered a lunch portion.  While working my way through the first ten percent of my plate, I quickly grew weary of the fork-to-mouth action, and lost myself in the idea of opening up my own chain of restaurants with similar portion sizes.  I would be honest about it, and call it  Glut .  Then I considered that name too obvious, wondering if a properly umlauted name such as  Glt  might give it that touch of Euroness to make it acceptable to the upscale coast dwellers.  I fantasized about properly Germanic employees with an appropriate Teutonic dourness, operating with Prussian efficiency.  I considered the  Lebensraum  menu option, where you would get your entree along with all adjacent items.  The fantasy quickly fell apart when I contemplated the viability of German cuisine, but it was still a good image.  After I consumed an insignificant portion of my meal, it was time to consider desert.  After all, the name of the restaurant is the Cheesecake Factory.  Duh.  I had looked forward to this $7 slice of cheesecake for many days, and I wasn’t going to let a little thing like an entrée that could feed thirty get in the way.  I selected the Chocolate Peanut Butter Cookie Dough Cheesecake.  I’m sure many of you have had cheesecake that you might consider the equal of the cheesecake found in this blessed establishment, so I must embark on a deeper explanation of what this particular cheesecake really means to Western Civilization.  Imagine a Diabolic Machine that can take several dozen ordinary cheesecakes and condense them down to one concentrated slice of pure Experience.  This is a slice of cheesecake that diabetics speak about in hushed tones of awe.  Overweight people within three miles find themselves leaning in the direction of the restaurant, caught up in an inexplicable urge to take a few steps closer.  Small children may not be exposed to the cheesecake.  I believe that specially plated forks might be appropriate utensils.  I consumed half of my cheesecake slice and promptly forgot most of what happened afterwards.  There are fleeting memories of feverish hallucinations involving sugar, Dr. Atkins and the inverted cross.    All in all, I have to say it was a good day.
