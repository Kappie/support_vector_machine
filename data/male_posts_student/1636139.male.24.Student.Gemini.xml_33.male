Well, there's a company in NorCal called MetroPCS that offers exactly such a plan so I now have a cellphone. It lets me call anywhere in Northern Cali any time of day and talk as much as I want, all for just $35/mo. 
I think I'm allowed to recieve long-distance calls at no extra charge so I'll publish my number here in case anybody needs to get a hold of me: 408-849-9673.
