It almost, but doesn't, make me feel bad about not getting my permit yet, but fortunately, my extreme mental prowess allows me to rationalize the fact that all I'll be doing until August is working a few blocks from where I live, or going to school.  So, I'm waiting until February break to get my Permit.  That's like three weeks.  So anyway.  Swim meet today.  I sucked, and I have overly high standards for myself, which makes me feel even worse.  I swam the five hundred today, which is 20 laps to those who don't know swimming, and sucked.  I came in last by like 30seconds to a minute.  Whatever.  I've been going uphill this year, so I guess I can redeem myself.  And school.  I don't like school.  I want to run away to the foreign land of LA, and work in Stephen Hoellers church and learn the ways of Orthodox Gnositicism from him.  Hell, maybe I could run away to a Thelemic enclave and learn Thelema.  The sky's the limit.
