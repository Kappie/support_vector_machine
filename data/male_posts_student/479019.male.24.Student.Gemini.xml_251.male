I managed to get the changes I mentioned a few days ago up as well. Hope you all like it.  Not much since my last post. I talked to Steff a bit, which was nice. She was just checking up on me to make sure I got home alright the other night, via the whole text message thing I showed her. I've also been chatting with her sister lately too. Both young ladies are quite cool. Heh... I guess their parents did a good job. I'm still feeling kind of bored though. Perhaps I'll give someone else a call after this since it's still free weekends for me right now.  ***
