I've written (once) before (a long time ago) about the sad state of the little red mouse nub in the middle of my laptop keyboard.  While I use a "normal" mouse (I don't know what that means, but it's a normal mouse, like it fits in the palm of my hand and rolls around) when I'm home, during class I'm forced to use the little eraser-like nub to make the cursor move.  And, for about the past year or so (my laptop's almost 4 years old... actually, its birthday is coming up in just two months... I should get it something special, like a CD burner), my red mouse nub has becoming more and more fragile.  No, fragile is too polite.  Destroyed.  It had a little rip, which became a bigger rip, which became quite a decent-sized tear.  And the fuzzy surface on top wore down to be smooth and shiny.  Making it hard to get rolling.  And making the thing pop off the laptop once a class or so, and make me scramble around on the floor to find it.  Fun stuff.  Anyway, my friend had an extra one, from a time when he had to order one for his laptop and they came in a pack of thirty or something unnecessary like that.  And now I have a brand new gray mouse nub, and, despite its lack of color, it's very lovely.
