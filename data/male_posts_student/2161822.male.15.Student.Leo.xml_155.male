Looking back, this year actually went pretty quickly compared to other years. Comical conversations and antics helped this year move on easier. Chemistry was painful, but it's finally over. Art class was a dissapointment, but we still squeezed every ounce of fun we could out of B period. Math was awesome this year I must admit. Mrs. Parsons was ...well  ... and Mr. J rules. So many good and random conversations in that class. Spanish was similar to Chemistry: painful. Lunch this year was ridiculous. History was pretty boring, but it was ok. Theology was retarded. It was a bit of a change from last year (work 15 minutes of class then free period/open notebook tests/open notebook and work with a partner exam). English was ok except for the god awful research paper. So I guess I can't complain too much about this past year. It could have been alot worse also. So here's to another year. Scarfaceology 101 is in session.   P.S. - Thanks for the dollar. Shady. Very shady.
