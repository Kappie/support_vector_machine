Whoever is out there that does that probably isn't reading this anyway, so I'll just type to myself for awhile. After things get weird, people will come. They'll be weirded out, and leave again. This is how it usually happens, in bloglife or not.  If you are reading this, I have no idea how you got here. Congratulations on finding this. I hope it helps you kill 3-4 minutes out of your busy, busy day. If I've done that for one person, I will stamp this venture a success. This will make my life not a complete failure.   I'm joking, children.  My life isalready there.  I have nothing more to say right now, except go listen to some Wilco. Buy their music. I'm a pimp.
