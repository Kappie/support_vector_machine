Under pressure.  That's such a beautiful song, isn't it? Thank you David Bowie for performing it, and thank you Dennis Leary for making it popular again. Hopefully, this week I won't be under too much pressure - I'm done with work for the summer (not that it wasn't an enjoyable experience . . .), school doesn't start for a week, and I'm finally getting some time to myself to read, paint, and do all the things I've been "meaning to do" since summer started. The only thing that's screwing everything up is my parents. They have this annoying habit of taking me to the trailer in Lake, Michigan (no, not Lake Michigan - it's a town called Lake) at the most inopportune times. I have nothing against being outside. In fact, I love the odd walk or bike ride through the park, perhaps a hike with friends, sitting around in the back yard, canoeing down the Au Sable, etc. It's "the outdoors" that I hate - purposefully subjecting yourself to the tired stereotype of rural life as opposed to actually enjoying nature. When will people understand that living out of a crappy trailer on the weekends is not "camping" nor remotely fun? Gah!
