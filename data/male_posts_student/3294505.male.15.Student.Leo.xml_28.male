Of course this would be a little redundant from this blog, seeing as I talk about things that happened to me every other day (and seeing as it's summer, and nothing'll happen, you get the picture). Maybe it'd be useful for someone who has that kinda capability.   I  almost  went to go see Chronicles Of Riddick today.  I didn't.  It's so great that it's summer vacation, but as much as I hated going to school, at least there were people to talk to there. Even those who I couldn't stand held reason for me to be around in a delapidated way, now I have noone to argue with except my mom. And skating with the same couple of people every day won't exactly cure my boredom either.   But rather than let this turn into a rant.....  I'm thinking I should go out and do something.  ........  Maybe later.
