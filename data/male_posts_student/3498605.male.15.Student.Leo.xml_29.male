First of all, I just typed the word "Jesus" and the second picture that came up was this: http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~lthomas/jesus.jpg . Now, I'm not saying that picture isn't hilariuos, but what if some little catholic kid typed Jesus and used that picture for a school report. The nuns at his school would beat the crap out of him, and its not his fault, he didn't know that was bad. So, I decided to type the word "Holy". Now, check this out: http://www.umbrart.com/images/holy.jpg . Yeah, that was the fourth picture that came up, and the only thing I could say to that is "WHAT THE F**K!" Now, that isn't even funny. That is just plain terrible! So, imagine this, a little kid is searching up a picture for a school report. He types "Holy" because his report is on the Catholic Church, and guess what comes up, PORN! I mean, come on, a religous word linking to porn! What has the internet come to! So, I decided to switch over to the regular Google search and I typed in the word "Dizney." I wanted to see what would come up if I mispelled Disney in a way that a young kid might spell it. So, I type it in and hit search. What comes up? The most disgust and worst thing imaginable. Basically, this is the title for the fist page that comes up, WARNING! THIS TITLE IS VERY BAD AND MAY BE OFFENSIVE TO SOME PEOPLE! THIS TITLE IS JUST AN EXAMPLE OF HOW BAD THE INTERNET IS AND IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY! So, here is the title "FREE CARTOON SEX! HENTAI, HEROES, DIZNEY, FURRIES, BONDAGE, TEENS ..." Honestly, that is the lowest a person could ever go! Soliciting, not only disgusting, but also illegal pornography to little kids! I mean, WTF!!!!!!!!!!!! I never though I would see the day where little kids would have to be constantly monitored online. I mean, If a little kid honestly searches for disney because they like disney shows, and the accidently misspell it dizney, they may click on the first site, and see some very, very bad things not even adults should see. Anyways, now, I am completely disgusted with some of the slimeballs on the internet today. As of now, it is my personal goal, as a hacker, to bring down these terrible sites, but flooding the crap out of them so the owners have to pay bandwith overcharges out the ass! Thats just my way of getting back out those slimeballs! MWAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAH! So, if any of you slimeballs are reading this, this is for you, "GO EAT SH*T YOU DIRTY MOTHERF***ING A** HOLES!!!  later, bradleyJ
