That's what I miss about Arkansas, or Louisiana.  A community of people with common goals and supportive mentalities.  I've got it to a degree in Austin, but there are just six other screenwriters, three with families and two with serious girlfriends and one with a fairly serious medical condition.  I'm building it with other folks outside of my discipline, and I am interested to see how those friendships progress, but for tonight, feeling at home with a bunch of third year med students on a house off Shackleford in West Little Rock...I want that to be my house.  I want people to feel that comfortable.  I want all levels of pretention to be wiped away, from the frat boys to the Buddy Holly spectacled guitar players.  Enjoy yourself, and don't just show an interest in the other people...be interested.    I heard the best shitting the pants story ever today...much much much better than my Borders experience.  Incredible.  The victim is allowing me to utilize it for any screenplays, something I'd normally have no problem with, as I realize that the writer rarely creates, he just takes from others and mixes it together to provide a theme...but this story is so good, I don't want to make fame or fortune or get laid because of it.  But would me getting laid because of his shitting himself be a perfect ending to the saga?
