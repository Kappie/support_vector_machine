I told her about the new revised "hate list" and she said that it isn't a personality trait he has that I don't, his personality is more compatible with her than mine is/was (I'll withhold my comments on THAT subject though :D).  I feel like I won't find the right person for me, but that's just because this has happened so recently and certainly hasn't helped me feel that great about myself.  Doesn't make me hate him any less.  The more I watch of him, the more about him I hate.  Example: Today, we had a fire drill.  I watched him "sneak" (by sneak, I mean crouched low to the ground and moving quickly) up to the group of people he (and whom I used to) hangs out with, pops up, obviously says "Where is she?", "sneaks" off, and finds her.  I honestly don't believe he can go longer than five minutes without seeing/touching/talking with her.  I'm amazed he can get through an entire class period...  We'll leave his life, to which I'd love to see burn and razed onto the ground :D, and say that eventually, this site will change.  For now, I just need to rant and rave.  Shouting into the vastness of the internet is nice.  When I get the time to, I'll post bios of my friends (names?  maybe "nicknames").  For now, I've got a presentation to make for English.
