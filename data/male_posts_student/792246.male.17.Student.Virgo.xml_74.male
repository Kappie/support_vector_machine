I have to do many things. And I can't due them because there is hair dye on my head. Ow. It stings.  I had ugly hair today at school. You see, the reason I am dyeing my hair is because we dyed it yesterday, and it was atrocious and ugly. So now we are dyeing it again. And if it's ugly, all of Paly will know and laugh at me tonight. I could be more optimistic. I'm not. So I ran around under my hood all day. I even convinced Kamikihara-sensei to let me have my hood up in class. How sweet of her. The worst were the people who thought the hair wasn't "that bad". I'm like...so you're acknowledging it's bad, and then you're saying I'm stupid for thinking it's really bad. So it's worse than telling me it's ugly. So stop it Kelly. Just because Kimmy hates me doesn't mean you have to.  25 minutes before the stingyness can go away. Go away stinginess! I think the pain is affecting my spelling. I spelled stinginess in two different ways.  Purple Haze will be a success I think. See, it'll either come out purple or black(the asian guy they have on the front has black hair. It's not until you look up close that you can see the purple. So that'll be awesome. Or it could be really black, which would be good. Or it will be purple, which would be good. I can't lose! Whee! Bikutari!  I'm doing stream of consciousness writing. I'm hoping by the time it's time to take the dye off I will be done here. Err...reverse that statement. Anyways, eggs. They're tasty.  Oh, so I celebrated Passover. Now, before you tell me I'm not Jewish, I want to tell you I am. Something people don't seem to understand is that Passover has very little theistic purpose and is much more of a cultural religion. And last time I checked, I was still Jewish ethnically. So maybe that's why I did it. I toyed with the idea of celebrating a bunch of holidays, but it makes sense the most to me to celebrate cultural holidays in Christianity(Do Lutherans and Presbyterians have any special days? You know, like the Catholics.) and Judaism.   Oooh, the dye just did a weird sting, it was like a sting orgasm. It kind of came up in sting power and climaxed for a few seconds then went back down. Maybe it was my brain cells frying.  Now it's in the phase where individual parts of my head sting. Bzzt!  Oh, my hair all just fell out and I am dead. Goodbye.  April Fools!  Oh by the way, in case you haven't noticed, It's past the day I SAID I would be moving. That's because I already moved. I am in Boston right now. Actually know, I convinced my mom to let me stay for prom,  but I'm leaving tomorrow of course.  Why do teachers feel the need to give homework on prom weekend? Are they thinking that if they give out homework people will do that instead of having sex and getting drunk. Well...I suppose that could be Living Skills homework.  Whee! Purple Haze!  15 minutes left. My mom is hovering over my shoulder. Now she's not. She's silly like that. La la la la la. "You could be doing homework instead of that?" "No, I couldn't. Sting make brain hurt." "Oh" .... ... This is going to be the stupidest post ever. I wish I could the LJ thing and only have some of it show up and you can click to see the rest on a seperate page. But nooo....that would be far too nice. :P  So Bret is famous. Funny how that works. He was in a Fiona Apple music video too, so you KNOW he's famous. And he was in "Tap Kids", some show in New York. Silly internet. And he has an entry on IMdb. Funny.  Shiranne and I have started "Pretty Person of the Day" in Japanese class. So far our winners have been: Clement Andy Jeannet Bret  I'm sure they're all honored. Though only Jeannet and Bret know they're winners, because Andy thinks(knows?) we're freaks and we've never talked to Clement in our lives. Good times.  I just realized my website will now probably show up when someone searches those names. Sorry if this happens guys, but hey, Brets already famous, and Luong is a common last name. So...who knows.   10 minutes. 10 painful minutes. *stares at clock* 9 minutes.  "I'm sick of this rain", said by my wonderful mother. Thank you mom.  8. Prom prom! It's like pom pom, only with r's. How exciting. Why is nobody going to prom this year? Off the top of my head, the following people aren't going to prom who should be: Tristan Claudia Portia Yael Shiranne Jonathan Lizzy Giboc Gabrielle Ryan(haha) SOME of the freshman in Japanese class...and sophomores. >_>.... _ Margaret Thatcher Bob Dole The guy on the packaging for "Clairol Herbal Essences Purple Haze Hair Dye."  5 minutes. What the hell is Level 3: Permenant. Is Level 2 a lower stage of permenant or is it semi-permenant. This sort of vagueness is unacceptable. We should burn Long's. On a day MJ isn't working there. We wouldn't want to lose MJ...yet. Not before she gives birth to the clone of Jesus. Wait, but I don't think MJ is a virgin....this ruins my plan. Okay, burn Long's whenever.  2 minutes. The guy on the box is looking at me. I think he's checking me out. Woo! I love it when Asian man on hair dye packages check me out, it makes me feel so good about himself.  1 minute. *stares at clock*. Doop. Deep. Doop. Deep. Doop. Deep. Doop. Deep.  Doop. Deep. Doop. Doop. Doop. Doop.
