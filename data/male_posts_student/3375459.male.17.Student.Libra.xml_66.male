I have to summaries what I’ve written regarding the technological aspect and issues on Punggol HBD flats by tomorrow, so that I can send it to my group leader to consolidate all our work. Another sleepless night, sigh.  Yeah, today we celebrated all the May, June and July Bibi’s Birthday with a 2.5kg choco cake. Hahahaa, it was so funny even though no one was ‘plasted’ with the chocolate cream. We the borthers each took a piece of cake and went after the ‘organizer’, who ended up running into the female’s toilet. So we stood outside the toilet waiting of our chance. She sticks her head out like a tortoise from it shell. Seeing her so scared, we retreated. But it was so damn funny when she ran when we were just walking towards her.   It all ended so fast, and it was back to the com with research on an overseas architect’s work this time. Here’s the slow part, try sitting in front of the monitor for another 4hours (I did 3+hours of research before that) looking for the same old guy’s work. Arrhhhhh…………….
