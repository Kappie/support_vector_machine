Okay, over it.  Yeah I get to do some photos for a website since the admin's too busy to do it right now.  I've done photos for him before.  The place would be http://kweb.us.  Anyways, nothing much new going on in my life.  Bought a new CD, Rammstein Live Aus Berlin.  Nice CD.  Just a live concert from Berlin, all there songs.  In other news, my friend has set up her message boards here http://www.bigassgoldfish.com/community/.  Meh, its all hot in here, going to go dump some water on me or something...Ta.
