Then afterwards we all went to buy fireworks.....we stocked up big time. Gonna be some big BOOMS tommorow. Then I went over my cousins who had alaina over and we through some smoke bombs and other small things. Then me and this chick and my cousins sat on the back porch forever while our parents were watching Cold Mountain, hey I know someone in that movie. Anyways. I went home and I talked to that girl till late. We were trying to get the webcam working but no lucky. Anyways im off to church.   Seeya
