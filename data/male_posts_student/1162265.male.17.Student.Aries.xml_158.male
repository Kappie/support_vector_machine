It's just so much better, I remember I was thinking about two different story ideas, although one of them is far more relevant to the now, and it's been burning under the skin in my fingers to be written.  I've never really talked about it for fear of people thinking it applied to me, but it's something more in general.  I know very little about Freud but from what I do understand, he had this thing called the "id" which essentially is the evil part of your personality lurking in the background.  It seems that this is some ancient sort of "reptile brain" lower function to me, but with all the civilization it seems so many of us descend into that part of the brain.  I was thinking of mixing that with Kuandalini-type of serpent fun.  Some guy who's awakened the serpent in himself, but instead of ascending, it descended.  So the guy is being controlled by his Id, and he can do nothing about it?  Except, I never liked the idea of being controlled.  No one is ever controlled to do everything, we all choose to do everything ourselves and I have an obsession with first person.  So this guy, you'd need to feel for him, but at the same time hate him for what he does.... but how?  I really gotta start crackin' on this, but my dad is shrooming.
