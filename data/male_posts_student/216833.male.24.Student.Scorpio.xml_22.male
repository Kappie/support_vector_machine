I have some super sinky ass farts going on tonight.  oh my.  mimi and i went to a thai resteraunt in dallas called the thai rose. it was really just alright. I had the Evil Jungle Price with tofu and some thai iced coffee and mimi had the asparagus and some sprite.  i enjoyed the time we had just hanging out. it was fun. we tired to go shopping for some family for christmas and saw these awesome new toys....remember the Rudolph the Red nose raindeer claymation cartoons that ALWAYS come on around christmas.  THEY MADE TOYS of ALL the characters and they are off the hook.  I want em all so bad.  That seriously gave me chills when I saw em.  It just rocks.  I mean....i love those shows and I watched em every year, that is a totally good memory of fun at christmas.  Man.....if you get a chance....buy me some....hehe...love john
