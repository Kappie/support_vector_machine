Well, today was quite mild. I cleaned my room, which took a few hours. Then I ventured over to Bridge of Harmony to buy some picks. Unfortunately, the staff there were being complete dicks, taking order after order while I was ignored. Finally, they rung up my beloved Fender Thins, which were a little overpriced at $4.25. It seems that every time I go there, the staff do their best to alienate me. I always get ignored, it takes forever for them to ring up something as simple as a string, and the senior associates yell at me. One time me and Chris were in there looking at basses and this guy said, "If you aren't buying, get out." Now we had been in the store for 5 minutes, and had just started to look at the basses. Obviously buying a musical instrument is a slow process, as you want to find something you are comfortable with and sounds nice. Chris isn't just going to drop 700 dollars without carefully looking over the bass. So we decided that our next instruments wouldn't be coming from there. Long story short, those guys are jerks.  Later on I played some video games, read  On the Road , and watched Jon Stewart make a Texas Congressman squirm. He was a member of the GOP "War Room" in Boston, and Jon nailed him when he started talking about John Kerry being ranked the most liberal member of the Senate. It was quite funny because he set him up for it throughout the course of the interview, and at the end you could tell that he was serious about what he was saying. I enjoy the Daily Show, and though they lampoon both left and right, it seems to be more than a little liberal to me. Heck, one of the co-creators has a radio show on Air America. Usually, they are pretty gentle about it, and they don't coddle the left either. I've watched the Daily Show sporadically for a few years, but I watch it about every night now.  Instead of blogging a lot last night, I sat down at wrote down what I was thinking on the back of some tabs. It was basically the same thing I blogged, but it was nice to actually write something instead of typing. Also, I enjoy looking at my handwriting. It has evolved from a harsh, angular, unreadable scribble to a soothing, flowing unreadable scribble.   I get paid tomorrow, which is cool. I don't have a plan yet on exactly what to squander my money on, but no doubt by 4:30 tomorrow it will be gone.   Tomorrow I think I might check out a movie, either the Village or the Bourne Supremacy. I'm leaning towards the Bourne Supremacy, because M. Night Shylaman is more than a little full of himself. But hey, so is Quentin Tarantino, and he makes great movies. Go figure.  Well, I'm not really out of things I want to say but I'll save them for tomorrow.  Fall asleep fast, because waking up early is the worst.
