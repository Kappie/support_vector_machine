They said thatI'm miles away from her, I'm just a normal friend...It's true, but what could I do to improve when I wanna advance yet she retreats?  I'll dream 'bout her everyday without fail, I couldpicture her cute face inside my mind with a 90% accuracy, the 10% lost to her hair change and her wearing spectacles. You may find it hard to believe, but I actually think that she looks more mature with her specs on, mix it with her cuteness andVIOLA! The prettiest girl I've met!!!   With so much imagination, yet no action. Yes, my pals kept pressing me to give her a call for the intimacy factor, yet I feelso timid whenever I want topush her numbers on the dial... I'm just like achick, trying to break out of my shell, yet afraid of the harsh facts of lfe, that things do not always go the way you wish... How I wish that myskin's a little thicker, so as to handle the embarressment of rejection. I like to take calculated risks, no, i hate to take risks, which explains why I'm afraid to take risks by calling her...  What topics could I make up if I call her? The lamest advice was to call her for homework advices. Hell, I'm in a freakin' different class with her!!! Yet my friend insist that a little silliness could be of some help, this, I'm not sure of... I seem to have no topics to talk to her, yet her allurence is making me crazy. Why can't I freakin' find a single common interest? Hell, I even have toresort tofind out what she likesfrom her friend... I'm so freakin' useless, I don't even think that she would even giveasingle thought about a relationship... Friends? I can't handle the truth...   Please, if 'you' know about this, give me a reply, at least reject me for, god's sake. Let me have a little air to breathe, or I'll just choke till death thinking of you yet not getting you...
