As far as I know, jackson has been suspended for a week or, as according to Angus, until he admits what he did was wrong (and not to mention discriminatory). The fact that his fellow  'g'z'  or  'krew'  are nowhere to be seen indicates that they may have been suspended along side their companion. All I can say is this: sweet, sweet, deserving, victory. Enemy forces have been detained. God bless justice!
