Yes, that's right, I'm talking about graduation.  Today, in history, we got our registration packets for our senior year.  That was pretty despeechifying (yes, I just created a word, so shoot me), and yet so incredibly awesome!  January's almost over, then it'll be short lil' ol' February, then March (a week of which is devoted to Spring Break), then April, and finally May (which is a blow off month anyway).  Then this wretched year that is my junior year will be over.  Life will be good.  I usually don't like to post too much newsy stuff here, but I'm really psyched about getting selected as Divisional Young Marine of the Year.  I've already been named Batallion Young Marine of the Year and Regimental Young Marine of the Year (which roughly corresponds to the Regional and State YMotY in civilian terms), so the fact that I beat out people from eight other states is pretty cool to me, seeing as I usually don't win too many things.  This means that in April, I will travel to Reno, NV (yes, NEVADA!!!) to attend the Young Marines' Commander Conference where I will compete with five or so other Young Marines for the National Young Marine of the Year.  And if I get that...well, I don't even want to get that far ahead of myself, so I'll stop, hehe.  Do you know that really awesome feeling you get when you get a very pleasant reminder of your past?  That's been happening a lot lately.  During lunch, a couple of my newspaper buddies and I sat down with Mrs. B (although she was only there for a couple of minutes) and reminisced about our elementary school experiences.  How fun it was to remember the boy who kicked the poor midget kindergarten teacher in the shin nearly everyday at recess, as well as the boy who undertook the daunting task of picking off every one (yes, EVERY one) of the fingernails off of one of his hands.  If only the rest of life were as simple as kindergarten, complete with recess, nap time, snack time, playdoh, and writing-to-read labs.  *sigh*  Those were the days.
