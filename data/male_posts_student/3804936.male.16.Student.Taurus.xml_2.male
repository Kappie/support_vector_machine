Each day I would anxiously wait for that light and it never failed me. But as time passed I grew afraid of its brilliance and drew away from it. The light followed me though I kept a distance. It was still affecting me. A short time later I grew less afraid and bathed in the light. When the light disappeared it was sudden. I was left in blinding darkness, left in fear and pain. I was slow to recover from the loss of the light. But I did and in a measure the light returned. I was happy. However the light soon reappeared in full glory. Thinking that the light would never leave again I accepted it back and never questioned where it had gone. I was wrong.  Again the light left me, plunging my world once again into darkness. I felt crippled as every old wound reopened and new ones formed. My soul hardened and I sank quietly out of sight. In time I may once again heal. I will never be truly whole again though. A piece of me left with that light and will never return. For now, I am content to live in the darkness with my despair as a crutch. Farewell and goodbye.    Friends,   -Dant
