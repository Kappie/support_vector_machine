Ben is also a gareth gates song, small, inconsequential, and a pain in the ass to listen to. revenge is sweet to the taste. it also smells like edam...no wait thats ben too. found an excellent band called hot rod circuit, anyone ever heard of 'em? now i look like it almost everything is like a gareth gates song, the internet-slow and anoying. charvers-again slow and annoying. the ceese in the fridge-out dated and gone off. heres a game kids, see how many things you know are like gareth gates.  bye bye everybody
