All I can think to say right now is that I want out of school...not in a couple days...now!  You know what else...something keeping my mind off of school tonight is Game 7 of the Timberwolves v. Kings series.  I am so pumped to watch it and I hope the T-wolves win huge.  The Big Ticket is going to have a big game...YOU BETTER WIN T-WOLVES OR I'LL MAKE FUR COATS OUT OF THE ENTIRE TEAM!!!!
