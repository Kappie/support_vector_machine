If your reading this Ashley, I love ya, lol.  Anyhow, here is somethin different. Last night, when I was feeling horrible, Adam Russell sent me this wonderful little analogy, I think all guys can relate to this.  "you just gotta take it man......its really hard to get over a girl that you really care about and have been trying to get for a long time......i know its worse than getting kicked in the balls over and over, but just like that, eventually the pain will go away.....it will take a long time....im not gonna lie to you and say it wont.....but then one day it will all be okay"  Apparently he thought I wanted to get over Ashley. Oh well, he was wrong. But the saying is still hilarious.
