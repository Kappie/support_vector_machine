But today was fun for the most part and a pleasurable experience.  Tyke had a math test 1st period.  It was group and it was pretty easy.  Triple Threat joined the group and made it easier.  Hopefully the solo test Tyke takes on Friday will be simple.  Nonetheless he doesn't care cuz it is just math.  2nd period was really quite tiring.  When you actually work out the whole period in weight training you really get tired.  Your muscles get very very tired.  But hopefully he will build up some strength and especially in his legs so that he gets a bigger vertical.  3rd period was stupid.  Just stupid lectures on stupid stuff that "you guys need to know."  So pretty much everything in that class is "need to know" information."  Really, if it wasn't something the class needed to know then why would she teach it???  Of course they know that everything is important.  Yeesh.  4th period was pretty fun.  All they did was listen to music.  Hopefully tomorrow they do the same.  At lunch they headed off to Costco and Tyke got a nice hot dog meal.  It was a great purchase for less than 2 bucks.  If only it were closer he could get pizza and everything there with plenty of time.  After lunch the day kinda breezed by.  After school was where the fun started.  After the walk with Purdy and Skippy to the p-lot Tyke drove on home.  He changed and called his mom to tell her he was going out.  In the call she asked him if his grades had come in the mail yet because she heard the message about the grading problem that the school had.  So he lied and said that he hadn't received grades yet.  Just to buy him some more time so that he didn't have to make anything up on the spot.  Then he went over to Amed's and was joined by Dr. Phil, Macaroon, Skippy, K-caj, and a little later Maniak.  They went to the court by Amed's house and played some hoops.  Tyke won the game of 21 they played despite his initial struggles with the double rim.  He then just took it to the house.  It was pure inside domination!  They played some 3-4 games after that.  Every time the team of 4 won.  It was fun though.  Tyke just showed how good he is when he posts up and takes it to the hoop against the defense.  Good to know for his future games.  And he still just kept hitting the free throws.  He doesn't know how he got so good at those all of a sudden but he did.  He just feels really comfortable shooting them.  He knows how to shoot them really.  And as long as his arms or legs aren't dead tired he is a dead on shot.  Basketball is really fun.  It's too bad he only played 2 years of competitive ball.  Not that he would be playing varsity now.  But ya never know.  Well after bball the gang went back to Amed's and Tyke had a Fuze (really good drink when you only have half of it) and another Nature Valley.  Then they played some Halo.  It was quite a bit of fun.  Tyke and Skippy won both games they played in and left at 5 with an undefeated record.  Good times.  After that, Tyke went home and he was really tired.  So he just kinda dropped onto his bed face first with the lights on and everything and just stared at the light on the charger of his cell phone.  And he was so comfortable that he just dozed off.  He woke up about 6:30 to the screams of his parents telling him dinner was ready.  So he went up and had dinner.  One topic of conversation was grades.  Tyke's grades.  But he played it perfectly.  He told his mom that he didn't get his grades but he knew what they were.  He told them the truth for all grades except for English.  He just didn't want to have to deal with the consequences of his english grade so he just said he got a B+.  They still talked to him about his math and physics grades cuz they weren't good either.  So they started talking about college and work ethic and stuff like that.  Tyke doesn't push himself at all but he knows he can so he just needs to prove to himself that if he tries to he can focus and do the work and get good grades.  That is why he might actually do some work this semester.  Just to prove himself right.  So anyway after that he played some NBA2K3 and shot some hoops downstairs and just hung out.  He hasn't really been talking much to people online.  Mainly just Amed and Purdy lately.  Maybe its laziness but who knows.  Kinker hasn't been on much so that is why he doesn't talk to him.  Occasionally Haras when she is on and Dotti sometimes but not much.  Its more of independent time for Tyke now when he is at home.  All in all, Tyke is tired.  So bye.
