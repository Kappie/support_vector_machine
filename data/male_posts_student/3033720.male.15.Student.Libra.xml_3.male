I got to solo twice, and it was improv. Other than the performances, the day was uneventful and boring. Actually, it wasn't.....I'm just tired and don't feel like typing much.  Quote of the Day:In band, when I was talking with Adam about going to Dollywood and getting wet together, Ashley said she would go in a white shirt with no bra and I said I would go without a bra too.
