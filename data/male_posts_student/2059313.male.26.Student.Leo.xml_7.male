I've lost friends due to distance.  Family due to illness.  Relatives from old age.  And more people than I can count due to time.  Losing someone is never easy.  And knowing how to handle it is even more difficult.  No matter how hard you try, you can never be fully prepared for it.  But how you deal with it will affect you for the rest of your life.  Deal with it badly... more than likely you will deal with most losses poorly.  Deal with it well... congratulations.  Knowing loss on a very personal level, I've given and been given a lot of advice.  Each piece of advice I give is usually tailored to the person.  Fortunately I haven't HAD to dish out advice or anything too often.  But today, I heard a really good piece of advice... or maybe more of a philosophy, than advice.  Where did I hear these upcoming words of infinite wisdom?  Well, the TV of course. heh.  From a show called "Charmed" it's a show about some witches, but they aren't bad witches, they're good witches... like Glinda of the North.  Y'know the one who hangs out with all the short people!?  Anyway, one of the sisters had to deal with Death in a physical form, and he gave her good advice.  Ready?  Here at last it is...  You grieve, then you move on.  BAM!  I know it sounds way too simple.  But this isn't like, "Okay, you grieve for two days, and then you should be over it."  NO!  Won't happen.  Anyone that you know that was worth grieving about will have you close to out of commision for a while.  You have to work through it.  If you had a really easy time getting over the loss of someone, then you're either a sad emotionless individual, or that person really didn't mean that much to you to begin with.
