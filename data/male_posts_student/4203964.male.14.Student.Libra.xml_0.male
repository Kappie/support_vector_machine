Anyway i'd like to thank evryone who posted in their blogs recently. Before I had resorted to reading almost everyone's blogs the entire way through due to lack of entertainment. Please people Im me or email me at my new email adress sjd919@hotmail.com Please people I need entertainment!   Today i got my haircut. I wasn't sure i needed cut but what the heck, right? WRONG!!!. Seriously I hate it. It's not a new style or anything it's just so darn short. The few curls I had had are now gone and it's just blahh. I'm gonna try some gel or something. If im not at wednesday night u people will know why. Seriously pray for me and my hair. SJD
