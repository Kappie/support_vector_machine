    
       the wounds will never heal.  constantly they will be reopened.  you can never feel the same.  all your trust and faith is lost... and you have nothing left to do but cry.  you wonder if you will ever be free of this pain.  you have to let go... and though you will never be the same... you do have hope.  just wait awhile... your hope will come to you... and then the flowing tears of this requiem will not be in sadness...
