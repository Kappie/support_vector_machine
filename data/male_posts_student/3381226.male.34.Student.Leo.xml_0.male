Of those channels I like about a half dozen, my wife likes two or three.  Tonight, but some mishap, she actually ended up with the remote.  I thought about killing myself after five minutes of her channel surfing.  She passed up a show on bees another on formula one racing and another on WWII.  The straw was Patton.  Can you believe she didn't want to watch Patton?  If you have never seen Patton, your life is deficent.  What did we end up watching?  Some chick flick with Jennifer Anistink and a bunch of gay characters.  The plot line was that Jennifer Anistink was SO hot she actually had the main gay guy batting for the other team by the end.  What a pile of dung.  If I was gay I'd be pissed.  Do you honesty think a person is gay just because they have nothing better to do?  All it takes is nice set of tits to change their mind.  Please how fucking ignorant.  Oh well, if was watching Patton right now I wouldn't be regaling you with my tale of women and TV.  I decided to drink a few beers tonight instead of trying to get laid.  The beer out of the fridge is warmer.
