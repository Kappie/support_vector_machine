The CD is called AFTERGLOW, the first single "Fallen" has been going up in VH1's top 20, but still hasn't got up to the top 10. Is a great CD, everyone says so, but maybe timing to market it was not the best. Dido has a new CD too and is somewhat a little more hip and is stealing a lot of place for Sarah. We have to remember that most of Sarah's fans listened to Dido as a comfort while she was in hiatus.  Still, Sarah has started to promote the single and she's looking great. The video is extremely good. Just go and get it. Remember, on Sunday 8th this month, on  Oxygen  there will be a concert with Sarah and Avril Lavigne, and  Lifetime TV  will premier her  Intimate Portraid  on Monday the 24th.  Try to fall in love with her music... You won't regret it.
