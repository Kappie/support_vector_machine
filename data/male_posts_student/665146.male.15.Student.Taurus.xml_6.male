Don't even think it.......  She was the best damn cat ever.  She could walk up to you and  make you  pet her.  She would stand right in your way and she wouldn't move.  Now, I'll never see her again.  I'll never hear her nails on the floor, her yowling at night, and her slurping of food.    (Not done yet)
