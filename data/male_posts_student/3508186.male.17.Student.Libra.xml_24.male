Well, I've been playing a ton of games and having a blast. Josh, Sean and Bernard have been coming over to play Mario Kart Double Dash for the past few nights and believe you me it's bad ass. It's been fun but I can think of better ways to spend all this time. I havent called Tosha in awhile and now she lives somewhat closer and I'd like to hang out with her like I have in the past. But I really dont wanna sleep with her, it would be kinda fucked up. She's too wild for me, yet I still wanna "hang out" with her.   This whole girl thing is startin to make me mad, I dont know why but it seems like I need a relationship to survive. That must mean that I'm weak or something, or some kinda loser, lol. Fuck it, whatever comes comes I just hope it's for the best. Pe-ace bit-chas!
