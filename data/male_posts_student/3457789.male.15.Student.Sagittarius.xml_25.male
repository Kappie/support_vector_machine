My friend, you can trust God today  He is good all the time  He is unparalleled and unprecedented  He is the centerpiece of civilization  He is the superlative of all excellence  He is the sum of all human greatness  He is the source of divine grace  His name is the only one able to save  And His blood is the only power to cleanse  His ear is open to the sinner’s call  His hand is quick to lift the fallen soul  He’s the eternal lover of us all  Who else can we trust but Him?    He supplies mercy for the struggling soul  He sustains the tempted and tried  He sympathizes with the wounded and broken  He strengthens the weak and the weary  He guards and He guides the wanderer  He heals the sick and cleansers the leper  He delivers the captive and defends the helpless  And he binds up the broken-hearted  Surely we can trust him    Jesus us the key to all knowledge  He’s the wellspring of wisdom  He’s the doorway of deliverance  And He’s the roadway of righteousness  He’s the highway of holiness  He’s the gateway to glory  And yes you can trust him    Jesus IS more than enough  He’s the all-sufficient King  He’s the king of the Jews  He’s the of all Israel  He’s the King of righteousness  And He’s the King of the ages  He’s the King of Heaven  He’s the King of glory  He’s the King of all kings and  He’s the Lord of all Lords  And yes again you can trust him    And rejoice in this my friend  He is a sovereign King  There’s no gauge to measure His limitless love  There’s no barrier to block His blessings outpoured  He is enduringly strong  And He is entirely supreme  He is eternally steadfast  He is immortally faithful  He is imperially powerful and  He is impartially merciful  He is God’s Son  And you can trust Him    I wish I could more accurately describe Him to you  But He’s indescribable  He’s incomprehensible  He’s invincible  He’s irresistible  You can’t outlive Him  And you can’t live without Him  The Pharisees couldn’t stand Him  But they found they couldn’t stop Him  Pilate couldn’t fault Him  Herod couldn’t kill Him  Death couldn’t conquer Him  And the grave couldn’t hold Him    My friend  He’s the Alpha and Omega  The First and Last  He’s the God of the present  He’s the God of the past  He’s the God of the future  And we rise to speak His name again and again  Jesus Jesus  He is Jesus  He is for us  So who can be against us  We can definitely, absolutely and totally trust Him -------------------------------------------------------------  Okay, this is a lame one i did for an english assignment some time back...   Daryl the bully    Daryl was a bully,  The worst of all there is,  nobody liked him  for he was so awfully naughty.    He tormented all the boys,  and broke all their toys.  Upside down he turned the neighbourhood,  no doubt nobody wanted to play with him.    He was really nasty,  sparing no one.  Even the feeble old lady was left soaking wet,  Completely drenched in lemon tea.    He would sneer, “You little wimps,  come and challenge me to a fight!”  Nobody dared to talk back to him,  Even though he was outnumbered.    He laughed at the children,  mocked them and called them names,  He would tease them,  “stand up and oppose me if you dare!”    Even the adults were at a loss  of how they would deal with him.  The children weren’t the only ones that Daryl terrorized,  The adults also testify of his unruly behaviour.    Daryl took Mr. Moy’s fax,  which he received from the insurance company,  and covered it with wax.  “Let’s see how you are going to read that!”    He was a horrible tyrant,  That ruled with an iron hand.  everyone was wondering  when his reign would come to an end.    All this was about to change  when Germaine moved into the neighbourhood.  All the children realized that Daryl behaved himself  Whenever Germaine was around.    The children decided to tell ask Germaine for help  After a long discussion,  she agreed to do her part  To try to convince Daryl to stop all of the bullying.    Germaine walked up to Daryl,  Who towered over her.  She uttered, “Pick on somebody your own size!”  Daryl was shocked and hung his head in shame.    “I’m sorry, I promise I won’t intimidate them any more.  But now nobody wants to befriend me,”  The big bully replied,  almost in tears.    “I’m sure they want to play with you,  only if you are nice to them,”  Germaine consoled the once great-and-mighty big bully,  “I’m sure they will accept you.”    Daryl tried to be nice to those he once terrorised,  after he had seeked everyone’s forgiveness,  he was graciously pardoned and played together with the other children,  who gained a new friend in return for pawning a bully.
