It's been like three weeks since I've last talked to her, and it's not normal. Longest we've ever not talkewd in the last year or so, was when she left for two weeks to Florida. I miss her so much... even just to talk to, cuz she's so great. Always thinking though, and it's not good. Thinkin' about her moving on already, finding someone else, and it's an icky feeling, and I've never gotten these so solidly before. I see her freinds list thing on her profile and its like... I've neevr been in that. Even back in the day, I was never there. Got thinkin that maybe I was never really her friend, or that she never thought of me as a friend, and that's an icky feeling too.      Sent her an email about 15 minutes ago... it could be good, maybe she'll start talking to me again on MSn or something. I just wish I kenw how she felt. I dunno if she doesn't want anything to do with me again, if she's mad at me, if she still likes me and is worried, or if she doesn't like me at all, and has moved on completely. Again, that fucking feeling, and it's fucking horrible.      It's like a shitty reversal cuz now I think i know how she felt over the last several months, when I was leading her on for my own security, and telling her I wanted to be with other girls. Fuck. If I just knew then that I was doing the most incredibly stupid thing ever, I fucking swear I wouldnt have done it. She is the best... simply. I don't want that out of my life, because she's someone you don't meet everyday, and I can fully understand that now, that I've gone through a little bit of what she went through.       It's just that feeling I get when i think about her moving on, being with someone else, being happy not to know me anymore... it's horrible. Fucking horrible. I wish she knew that. I wish she knew that i lvoe her, and that I don't wanna mess up anymore. But it's not about me all the time. If she feels that she'll be happier not talking to me anymore, I want her to not talk to me. But like... she said she loved me and like... I just don't know how she could go on, and forget about me, if she honestly felt what I felt then, and what I still feel now. I want her to be happy... but I want to be happy too. I want us to be together... but I understand maybe that's not supposed to happen right now, or ever for that matter, but it feels so fucking right.      Goddamn it, I don't even like Lindsey like that... I don't even wanna talk to Lindsey anymore. And fuck... just if I could take back what i said about me liking her, because I obviously dont, and didnt then, I'd take it back. Why I said it... I dunno. Lindsey's just been there for so long, and I thought I liked her, and I didn't want Jenna to not know... it'd be like I was screwing her over, or something. But like... I didn't, and don't, like Lindsey like that.       It's just very confusing for me, when I don't know how Jenna feels... because I don't knwo whether to move on, or if it's still possible to be friends with her. I just thought it would last forever... it felt like it was gonna last forever.
