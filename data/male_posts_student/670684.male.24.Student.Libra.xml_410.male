Brian listens to 90.7 (or 90.1), a Constitution-based radio station in Austin.  Not liberal, not conservative.  Not even libertarian, as I first pegged it, though the belief in the Constitution is a close representation.  Not progressive, though such stations are popular in the area.    Often it is a hodgepodge of mess spewed forth from the radio...good talk that encourages conspiracy without really looking into solutions to problems.  However, after buying Bob Jensen's WRITING DISSENT book at Half Price today (autographed as well, mind you) and reading a bit about setting the parameters of debate, I was more inclined to listen to the station with open intentions.    I got a good show...some guy whose name I forget, but he started with the problems of the news media, something I am always happy to chronicle.  Mainstream news is traditionally nine months to a year late on reporting news.  This isn't in relation to typical "Bush To Stay The Course" bullshit articles where the person in power gives a speech to say he will continue to do what he's doing, because that's just reporting a public relations course.    I'm talking Election 2000, where 58,000 Floridians were kept from the vote, and news correspondent Greg Palast found where the error trail led (Katherine Harris, Florida Election Commission, Jeb Bush, and rich supporters of George Bush), before the Supreme Court ruling, and no one in America picked his story up.  A year later, the story surfaces, but has no shelf life because "it's in the past."  It wasn't when it was written.  Same with Iraq.  Go back to 2003 discourse on this blog, and look at what we're hearing now about WMDs and reasons for war.  I wasn't making shit up last year, I was getting it from other news sources.    Basically, mainstream news follows this paradigm:  issue happens.  correspondent covers it.  finds something fishy is going on.  checks information with a source.  source is in power, and would be adversely affected by this story.  source says the fishiness doesn't exist.  story dropped.  nine months later, the cover-up stalls, and story breaks mainstream.  power source who said it was nothing earlier now says "we had misinformation" or "that was a long time ago" or "we all must focus on the task at hand."  story dies.    Gotta love public relations.    This all comes back around to a documentary I want to shoot where I go to Norway to find my dad's side of the family.  I've always wanted to tie it to immigration, but now I wonder if I can extend it to more of a world theatre view of America today, versus 100 years ago when my grandfather came over.  Personally, I'm not happy with the state of this country at the present, especially in its foreign policy.  And while I will see improvement under John Kerry, it's mostly because Bush will be out of office unable to fuck more stuff up.  That I hope that Kerry can get us back to the mediocre status quo we held under Clinton says just how awful George W.'s tenure has been.    I wonder if it will work.    Thinking about this documentary gets me thinking about my dad, who again is missing.  He does this ever so often...doesn't contact people, won't return calls.  Granted, I don't call him, but his mom does.  He's supposed to send information to them so we can do this Living Estate thing, and he won't do it, probably because there is already a lien on the property.  Suffice it to say, I am not the biggest fan of my dad's.  I actually could be, and I'm not really a fan.  Anyone who wants to see how alcohol can ruin someone, come talk to me.    The sexy stoner...we had a real visceral moment last night, where somehow the conversation came and I said something and it spurred her to tell me that her dad was dead.  Lung cancer from smoking.  He was an alcoholic too.  We shared something in common.  And we both kind of just shrugged it off...it's sad when it gets to that point, where a parent can be in a world of trouble, and it affects you less than someone cutting you off in traffic, because you've dealt with it so much it just lost its importance somewhere.    This is all kind of a lie, as I'm sure when he dies I'll be shook up for not having been able to help him.  I'm afraid of him, I'm afraid of bringing it up.  I've done it before, to pourous results.  He's tried.  He couldn't do it.  It's kind of sad, but when you see how he treats others, it's tough to steadfastly support him... that's just the alcohol talking .  Anyway, the fight to find compelling audience fodder for this documentary continues.
