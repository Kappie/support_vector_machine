The first was meant to work on the origins of good and the following post was intended to illustrate good's inherent evil by its connection with greed. Hopefully, both essays will be returned toin the near future so that they may be given the proper treatmetnts they deserve. Thank you for your patience, -the mgnt.  Are there any good that we cannot directly correlate to personal benefit? It seems that any of the goods we recognize, there is a positive consequence attached, whether immediate or delayed. Gratification and pleasure are goodness in their purest form as they are an end in themselves and cause these positive effects on the experiencer. All these pleasures, however, can only serve to wet the appetite for future, more intense goods. Aristotle accidentally set the groundwork for this when he mentioned, “of goods the greater is always more desirable” (134-35). This is a perfect example of the greed inherent in mankind. The desire to acquire more and more happiness forbids him to be happy with what he’s got. Why can’t we just shut up and appreciate what we’ve lucked into rather than bitching and endlessly scrambling for any personal advantage we can scrounge out of the earth or from another person? Happiness isn’t happiness. Happiness is a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Its only purpose is to bring the final, ultimate end, the void, nothingness, which is the only true happiness. All things we ascribe happy traits to are only paltry imitations of what will be later, but since we won’t make it that far, we think what we have is good. My oh my, much farther on this rant and we shall both be lost and annoyed, to pissy to carry on. One more round are we shall be ready to start again.
