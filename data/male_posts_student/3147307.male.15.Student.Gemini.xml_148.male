Anyways, I drove up from Bloomington today for Driver's Ed (see one drives down, the second drove through Bloomington, I got to drive back). Better than anything I've ever done in that class. I think I'm gonna resort back to old times: 104,400 seconds, 1740 minutes, 29 hours, 8 class sessions, 4 drive times, 8 days left of driver's ed. This week is moratorium week statewide for all IHSAA schools (a week off from any athletics...if you get caught - ouch!) so no running with the team this week (some time to ride my bike and to run on my own). And to catch up on Bible Bowl. After today, I will have had 4 hours of study this week. On another note, camping trip is coming up...I can't wait - like I said earlier, second best YG event (ski trip's better)!  "Drive carefully!
