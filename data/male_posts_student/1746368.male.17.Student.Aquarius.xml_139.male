For you long time readers, you know that I am not usually mean.    Finale:: Well, that kinda sounds like "Final" which I don't have to take.  Martial arts:: I took one class.  Flirt:: OOOh, that got me in trouble once. I didn't do it on purpose!  Energy:: Wish I had some  Flavor::   Guess?:: "346443896753 + 5, with one of those little squiggly lines." "Amazing, you could have guessed treaty of Guidalopea Hidalgo and been closer!"   Accomplishment:: Not accomplishement  Prom:: CONFUSING  Diploma:: In what?  Bloody:: L *lets that sink in*    I've been saying that a lot lately "I'll just let that sink in." Onery, aren't I?  Well, it's 11:00 and I have nothing to do. I am not going to church tomorrow, so maybe I will post a LOONG Blog about something. I'm not sure what. I am starting to write a story, but I have already forgotten the first paragraph or so. Wait...I have just been informed that Melody still has it. *Posts it here*  "Quack quack duckie, quack quack." said the seemingly incomptent little human being.      Walco wanted to say: "You stupid humans, you wait, our race is superior to you. We will rule over you with an iron fist and take your children to prison camps. Your adults will be our entertainers, they will run around yelling "Quack quack." We will convert your duck ponds to sanctuaries and change your houses to training camps. Who will have the last quack then, eh?"     What really came out was: "Quack"
