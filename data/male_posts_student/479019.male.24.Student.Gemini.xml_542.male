       
      I just realized that I like living alone, because it gives me time to be anti-social. Living at home has been annoying, because there's some around to talk to you. And they talk to you, when you want to be just left alone. I don't really need someone to tell me what's in the fridge, or what they did, or whatever... when I'm home, I want to be left alone.  ***
