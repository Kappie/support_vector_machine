I just went out and bought The F-Ups debut cd. Its a good cd i tells ya. Nice sound and nice lyrics, its an overall nice cd. and it was only $10.49! Wow my hand just went numb from writing that sentence, hmmm, crazy i think im going to die, or just fall asleep. whatever comes first.  this post means nothing, and i want to get out of the house. Leave me a comment on what to post about next time!
