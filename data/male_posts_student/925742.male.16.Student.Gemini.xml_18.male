I think it was about what I like about EQ.  Speak of said game, it 0wnz.  It 0wnz b0n3z.  It r0x0rz my s0x0rz, b0x0rz, j0x0r, and c0x0r.  It is so open ended.  You can even fly around!  You can level up without killing a monster!  You can do quests and ally with a faction, or be a lone killing machine, fighting for your own cause and trying to score phat lewt.  Its all good.  My only beef is that the orcs look like green hairless gorillas.  Shouldn't they look more piggish, staying true to most FRPGS?
