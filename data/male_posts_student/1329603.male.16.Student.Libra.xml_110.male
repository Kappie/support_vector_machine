No-one cross 2 pairs of fingers, that's bad luck, just 1 pair will be helpful. Thankyou!  Anyway, 089.co.uk is redesigned.  Go see! . It's actually probably one of my best designs. Nice and simple, gets the point across. ...Well, actually, to tell you the truth, there's less of a point on it than on W.H. Round's Sphere for Fat People but still...  Mebbe I should get off the net and practice my singing. Actually, though, my throat feels like Hell. If Hell was a load of phlegm. I don't care how that's spelt, but still... yuck. I'm sucking a strepsil at the moment. Hoping that's going to help.  You ever noticed how many contradictions each paragraph seems to have? I don't want to appear indecisive. As that is entirely not the case.  I can't decide whether I want to go for M. Thenardier at the auditions, as well as Marius and Valjean. OBVIOUSLY I'm only going to get one of them, not all three. That would be a very inconvenient experience. I don't know. Maybe, maybe not. I'll see how I feel at the time.  Still haven't got round to learning Java, doing my Brass Band and Jack Teagarden fanlistings, and thinking of a decent theme for my site. Still haven't revised for the mocks on Monday. I'm about as organised as the United Nations Security Council.  Quote of the day: "You shall go out with joy, And be sent forth with peace. And the mountains and the hills Shall break forth before you."  From   You Shall Go Out With Joy   Love, Jon Roskilly
