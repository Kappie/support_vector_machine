There were promises of food, drag queens, free drinks and water polo boys in their speedos.  When I arrived, at around 6:40, the only food that was left was Swedish meatballs. And since I haven't eaten red meat or Swedes in over ten years, I passed. Additionally, there were no speedos to be found anywhere. PLUS, to top it all off, I knew NO ONE at that place. It has become increasingly rare for me to walk into a crowded bar and know no one, but somehow, I managed to do that this time.  I left for a brief moment to grab a bite to eat, and a cute boy making eyes at me through the window at Hearty Boys Caf√© helped make the decision. When I went back, I was feeling energetic, so it was time to meet new folks.  I looked for guys who looked like fun, but who weren't busy posing. Who looked like they were friends, but not trying to cruise too hard. Because I was in the mood for making friends that night. I had work in the morning. I happened to stumble across a nice foursome of fellas named Eric, Zach, Scotty, and Craig, and there was some weird guy who left as soon as I got over there, and so I assumed he was just hitting on one of the guys there. They were very nice, and quite receptive to the idea of being my new best friends. I, of course, was anxious, because I just wanted to talk to people and not feel alone in a room full of people, but, looking back, they were actually quite cool. And plus, sometimes I need to remind myself that it is a privilege to know and be liked by me, so good for them.  The show ended with only a brief show of speedo. My new best friends and I were heartily disappointed.  They left, and I was hanging out with Paolo and this dancer guy, Devon, whom I met at Berlin one night. But then, as happens when you hang out with Paolo sometimes, he got on the prowl, and I was sorta out in the cold. That's fine, I guess.   Weird things that happened:   Paolo's friend, Casey, refused to tell a guy his ethinicity, because he was "post-ethnic American". There are a number of reasons why someone might say this, some good, some bad. I wonder which Casey had in his pocket.  When this guy came over to talk to us, I was engaged in my normal degree of self-aware histrionics about my dating life. Woe is me, the usual. I stopped, because there was some man who was not involved in our conversation listening, and he was a stranger, and didn't need to know how pitiful I was feeling at that point. Paolo turns around and tells him that I am a "player". Wow. A stranger? And that's not even true. And maybe those who don't know me need a briefing. I get a lot of phone numbers, probably more than most of my friends, but the quality is low.  We're talking scheisty lawyers, and scheistier law students, people not over their exes...am I supposed to be forming strong relationships with these people. I was a little frustrated, and no one was talking to me, because they were getting their cruise on, and it was not my evening for such things. So I left. I'm healing.
