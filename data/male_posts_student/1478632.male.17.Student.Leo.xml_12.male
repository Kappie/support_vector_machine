I have a flaming moron near me and I'm not sure what his problem is...for some reason, he just stands there screaming at me and other people, for no reason whatsoever. Oh well.   Another note, I'm about to make fun of people. I'm sitting here in CAD class, and I guess I've inherited a protege (*sigh*) from the teacher. The thing is, this kid can't hold his own for crap. Yesterday, for example, I told him how to do the same thing about twelve times before giving up. Needless to say, I'm a little annoyed by him.   Another Idiot that I can't stand is Senator Fritz. For some reason, he thinks that people need to have their computers all equal and with "Trusted Parts." These "trusted" parts have special chips on them that allow the Trusted Computer Platform Agency to know what you do at all times. They will log your keytappings, and they will be able to remotely scan your computer and delete any files they don't like, such as music, "Innapropriate" games (GTA III for example), and any pirated stuff on your computer (music, games, videos, etc).   Oh ya, speaking of idiocy, check out my friend's blogs:  urlLink Dismantled Intentions  and  urlLink Monochromatic Existence    I'll update later.
