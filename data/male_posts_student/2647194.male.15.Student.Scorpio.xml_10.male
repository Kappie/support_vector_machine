Great movie-absolute classic Mel Brooks comedy. Everyone should see it-just like everyone should read American Gods.  These days, everyone needs something to look forward to. Here's my list: 1. Talking to: Caitlin, Amelia, Amanda, Shayl, Liz 2. Summer (of course) 3. Biking 4. May Term 5. MITY 6. Getting done with this stupid English project  To everyone who's had a crappy week, or even a bad year, here's what I say: Just tell yourself to hold on just one more day, and keep doing that. Eventually, it'll be summer before you know it. Just keep saying it, and you'll get through it all.
