Isn't that great or what. This site is called  urlLink  Chit Chat   and they have some pictures for you all to see there so do go check them out, the little one is so cute.   ---   Boy o' boy this is going to be one hell of a week. Even though this week is ending, I still have a busy time ahead of me. School starts in about one week and I still haven't started my summer reading. I need to really tonight but I don't feel like doing it right now.   I hate school, I must say. I really hate my high school too for it is just ugly as hell. Do you know how long my high school,It's called  urlLink  Milton   by the way,has been up? Ever since the 80's!! And ever scince then, the school has become infested with rats and rouches. Anyway, they are building a new high school soon yet it won't be done until my senior year in 2005-2006. Isn't that just great or what?   I wish I could go to this other high school,  urlLink Alpharetta High School . The school is brand new and this year will be its first year of classes. And I must say right now that I have never seen such a great looking high school before. Sadly though, I am districted to go to Milton. AHH!   No matter though, school is just school, right? I do hope I get the classes I want. I signed up for Web Design, Sculpture 2, and Graphic Design. And it all starts August 9th, much later then my past years of high school.   Well one thing is for certian, at least I get to go to Universal, Orlando before going to school! WOO HOO! Thats my favorite place to go to on vacation and I plan on having a great time while I am there.   Anyway, I got to run. Later everyone!      Wolfwood
