       
       I came back with you in a bus, but I wasn't sad. I kept looking at the sky thinking how fun it would be to go home. Didn't you? I'd yelled and screamed at you, counseled you, and stared at you for the last six days, but I wasn't sad to go. I was tired.  Very  tired. You didn't seem to be from the continuous roars you made on the trip home. Perhaps  Remember the Titans  wasn't good enough for you, but it was good enough for me. I slept. I drooled a little, and you made fun, but I don't care. I don't have to see you again for another two weeks. Thanks for sleepless nights of counting mosquitoes, trips to the"head" where some of any diseasecould have been found, and long "chow" lines where I waited for you to trade in your rock throwing for a nice pancake breakfast. But all that doesn't matter now. I'm home.
