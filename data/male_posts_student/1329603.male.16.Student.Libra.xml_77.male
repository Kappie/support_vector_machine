She's cool, small, and I didn't seem to have the urge to constantly look at her breasts. Not once, in fact, had I the urge to focus my sight on her chest region. *feels all not manlike* But yeah, she's the queen among men. Not that the converstation got me anywhere in particular but 'tis not often that mere mortals are allowed to speak with these demi-gods. And she's certainly demi-sized (alright, enough with the focusing on her smallness). On the way there we were taken by Miller's dad in his Audi TT, which is surprisingly cramped. However, he is a music fanatic ^_^ and likes John Lennon ^_^. What is more, he said he might try and put Rock and Roll (the Lennon album) onto a CD for me ^_^_^. AND he ranks Working Class Hero in his top 3 Lennon songs ^_^_^_^.  I made a really good terragen render of an icy scene today, shall probably use it for some kind of christmas thing on 089.co.uk closer to the time of Christ's celebrated birth. It took me about 50 minutes, and about 40 of that was making the ice look like ice.  Miller, you need to come here and live or something, you're cool.  Quote of the day: "They hurt you at home, and they hit you at school, They hate you if you're clever, and they despise a fool, Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules."  From Lennon's   Working Class Hero   Love, Jon Roskilly
