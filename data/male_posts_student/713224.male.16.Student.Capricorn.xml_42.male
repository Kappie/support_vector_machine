I could just go on and say I wanted to be a bloody millionare, and theyed give me a million dollars. But back on subject... They had a band on there called "The Sly Caps". and here is thier site:  urlLink The Sly Caps . Most of the pictures there are from the MTV special, too. I was impressed to find thier website, and still see no news of a record deal. actually... I was dowright disappointed. Thier song was (and still is) stuck in my head. It was pretty catchy, so I would buy thier CD if one came out... yah.
