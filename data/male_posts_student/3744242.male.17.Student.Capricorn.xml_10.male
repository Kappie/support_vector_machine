I feel so rested now, and did I need it after yesterday.  At camp, we had a shaving cream fight witht eh kids and I'm still finding shaving cream in the most unusual spots today (don't get any dirty ideas). I wasn't able to hear for most of yesterday because I couldn't seem to get the shaving cream out of my ears...weird I tell ya.  Later on that day, for our councilor challenge, our task was to pick out Ju-Ju Bees (or whatever they are called) out of a pie tin covered with whip cream without using our hands.  I like whip cream as much as the next person, but not when its up your nose.  It has the worst smell ever when you have to breath it in and every time I inhaled, more of it would be pushed farther back into my nose.  Not the most pleasant thing ever.  Let's just say that at the end of the day I really needed a shower to get the thin layer of shaving cream, whip cream, and lake water off of me.  Later on that day, Pat and I shared some Dew and chips and played videogames all afternoon, one of my favorite past times.  If you ever have a chance to try Guacamole  urlLink Doritos , don't pass the opportunity up...they are great!  And if you are into videogames, especially war games, you really should try out  urlLink Full Spectrum Warrior , it is a really fun game!  Then we played a mission or two in Ghost Recon and we kicked some major Georgian butt.  We retook T'Blisi and saved the American embassy from certain destruction.  Yeah, that's right...we are heroes, no need for thanks and gratitude, just money will do.  Ghost Recon, now that's another game you wargamers out there should try if you want some real Spec Op fun.  And here's some  urlLink fun  for the rest of you (just click the link on "fun").  Well, I'm going to be on the Cape for the Fourth and should be back early Monday.  If any of you are going to be near Falmouth this weekend, just give my cell a call (if you don't know the number, then I'm not going to tell you) and maybe I'll see you there!  But for now, I have to finish packing and doing stupid chores...so, make like a tree, and get out of hear!  Out
