I stayed up until 4AM, then woke my ass up at 10AM to be sure that I'll be hella tired by the time I go to bed.  Last night my dad made hot dogs but I got this  ingenous  idea to heat up some tortillas and put them in there instead of the stupid buns. It was grand.  Yesterday what's-her-face called me again. Wooo I'm truly the greatest guy.  I  answered the phone and told her  I  was unavailable because  I  was taking a shower. She asked  me  if  I  could tell  me  to call her back later. How stupid do you have to be to not recognize the difference between  me  and  me  on the phone?  And now I give you random pictures of elephants:
