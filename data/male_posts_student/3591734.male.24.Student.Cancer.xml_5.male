Decided to go for the  urlLink Erotica Expo 2004  at the last possible minute. I can safely say that there was more T than an issue of Playboy, Penthouse and Hustler combined.  The evening held store for many more delights to come. After blabbering on about Absinthe I finally decided to take the plunge into the alluring waters of La FÃ©e Verte. This was aided by the $30 bar tab I'd won at last week's pub quiz. Kim, to my suspicion, has little to no bartending training. After taking a good eternity to find the bottle, she was quite unsure on how to prepare it. Luckily, Kelly saved the day. And that's the story of how I had my first glass of Absinthe. After much research on it, I was still taken aback by the strong licorice taste. The two cubes of sugar drowned out some of the bitterness... it's probably an acquired taste. But I'm still quite intrigued and I will make it a mission to sample the good stuff next time.  Moving on to the Che Fu gig. Since I was already inside the bar a good two hours before the gig had started, I didn't have to pay the $5 cover charge. Everyone else did, and I walked around with a smirk unlike but not quite entirely the one George "Dubya" Bush wears when he's jerking off to footage of smart bombs landing in civilian areas of Baghdad.  The icing on the cake... or should I say the topping on the pizza was when I decided to bounce home early and get some dinner from Pizza Guy near my place. Got a free upgrade from a 9" pizza to a 12". I gotta get that dude some weed next time. Only a stoner would have given someone a $6 discount...
