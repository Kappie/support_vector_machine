PLAN, or IDEA, NOT SCHEME!) last week. The awards will be decided on Wednesdays, amd If anyone wins, then E-Mail me if you want the code.  urlLink mailto:Neb_thims@hotmail.com   urlLink http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail69.html  This is really funny if you know the series (though completly irrelevent to MOTW) I found Josh C's Blog, and you all should have a look, because he has done some really clever things with it. (Plus, I told him I'd tell you to look at it, so PLEASE leave an comment on it!)  urlLink http://www.talkingaboutstuff.blogspot.com   Josh C's blog. The Amazing MonkeyMan Ben Smith
