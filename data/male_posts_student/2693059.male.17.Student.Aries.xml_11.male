Reno trip comes up Friday and if i dont get my mind right ima fuck up some more there.  Im starting to notice how all the badass undeserving people who lie and do all this bullshit get everything they want.  And all the good people don't get shit.  I hardly know ne good people with good lives and if you know alot  then hahaha they probably aren't and your just a blind dumbass.  Good people don't get second chances the bad ones do.  So i suggest we all become sleezy ass losers...that is the true path to becoming successful.
