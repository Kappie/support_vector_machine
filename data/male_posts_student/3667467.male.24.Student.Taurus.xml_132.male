Ed Schrock is a stauch supporter of Reagan-era economics and international policies and can't stand gays in the military, which he believes was a failed experiment by the the Clinton Administration that ruined troop morale (this was an integral part of his campaign). He also served two tours in Vietnam and looks kind of like my grandpa. With 84% of the vote, Schrock defeated his Green Party challenger by a more than 5-1 ratio. Congratulations, Ed. And, just wondering: did your family come from Lancaster County?  "You all up in my grill but you don't know what I'm cookin'!" --Clarence High School Student
