It's pretty easy to explain actually, everybody already has a Xanga so I decided to get off that band wagon and hop on another one.  I wanted to be different than the general public, so I created a Blogspot and am going to neglect my Xanga now.  Besides, I don't know how to edit the template on Blogspot so I won't beable to waste time messing with it like I do with my Xanga.  So, why I'm I coming out of retirement now?  It's because I'm bored as hell, that's why.  As you know, boredom seems to be sexually attracted to me.  Writing these horrendously boring blogs seem to keep it away from me for a while.  Besides, writing blogs wastes a lot of time, which I have way too much of at the moment.  Just to show you exactly how much free time I have, I have come up with an inequality:   infinity    Simple huh?  Basically what I'm trying to say by writing this entire post is summerized by these two points: 1.)I think Blogspot is better that Xanga  2.)I am bored!  Oh yeah, one more thing.  I have this qoute that I got from Miyamoto Musashi, some famous samurai but I'm not going to get into his history.  He said,"Do nothing which you will regret."  In his infinite wisdom, still less than my free time, I think he what he actually means is this: "Do everything and regret nothing."  Reach out on a limb, explore the unexplored, do whatever you want, just make sure that when you're done, you don't regret any of it.  I guess that's all, unless I forgot something, which is very likely.  Doesn't matter I guess I'll just put in it my next update, don't wait for it though, it might never come, I might retire again. =P  - Some loser   "Do nothing which you will regret." -Miyamoto Musashi
