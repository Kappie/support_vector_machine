This evening, as the title suggests, I played disc golf. I had an ok game, nothin' special. I have decided that my glove that I wear isn't the super glove of power, but more of a glove of random luck. Every shot I really tried to do good on turned out bad; but any shot that I just kinda tossed ended up exactly perfect. It was rather interesting. But yeah. Afterward we went to Wal-Mart and bought some ice cream. It's like, cherry cordial's in chocolate truffle ice cream with ameretto. Does that not sound completely awesome?! I can't wait to dive in. After I eat my ice cream, I am going with Devin to play Doom 3, a game that is supposed to be a super-cool, neato, sweet game. I'll probably be up near to all night; who knows. It doesn't really matter because I don't have too much of a reason to be here since Bon isn't home tonight. Well, I'm off to eat some ice cream.
