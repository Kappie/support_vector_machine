It's been a long time since I updated!  I added quiz results on left side... same results as Rei. *blinks*  Rei'chan-s coming on Wednesday! Sugoi!!!  On a lower note... I couldn't go snow tubing today... -.-*  On an even  lower  note, I have midterm exam on Saturday! Japonaise... *sigh*   meh  Wish me luck!  -ArV
