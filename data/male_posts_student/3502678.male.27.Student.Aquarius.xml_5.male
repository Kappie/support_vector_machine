Its perfection is hidden in the Cross  of Christ.   St. Mark the Ascetic   We believe that the divine presence is everywhere and that "the  eyes of the Lord are looking on the good and the evil in every  place." But we should believe this especially without any doubt  when we are assisting at the Work of God. To that end let us be  mindful always of the Prophet's words, "Serve the Lord in fear"  and again, "Sing praises wisely" and "In the sight of the Angels I  will sing praise to Thee." Let us therefore consider how we ought  to conduct ourselves in the sight of the Godhead and of His  Angels, and let us take part in the psalmody in such a way that  our mind may be in harmony with our voice.   St. Benedict   In a quest to realize the presence of God at all times, it would seem that the easiest would be in the context of "minstry" or "worship." However, I find that I am often so distracted at times like these -- perhaps it's the curse of being a former worship leader, that I am often caught up in the event itself.
