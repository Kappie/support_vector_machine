We watched Everwood (Was coolness) while eating a nicely prepared cheese on toast by Roger (Chloe's dad), then we played with BUBBLES !!!!! .. thats right, BUBBLES !!!! .. then we watched Fight Club, i have seen it 3 times before, but this time it seemed different, i dunno why ! and Chloe bought me, Skittles to share, a bottle of Oasis, Milky Bar to share and some Poppets. Then we walked up to the train station and watched this big fire, was lovely ! .. and then the train came. I really enjoyed today, it was good fun !
