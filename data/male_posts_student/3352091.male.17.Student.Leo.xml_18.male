I cant wait, ive always wanted to visit new york. I want to enjoy my summer to its fullest but i also cant wait for college. To quote a favorite movie of mine:  "I find I am so excited I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. I think it is the excitement only a free man can feel, a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain... I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams... I hope"                        -The Shawshank Redemption  Really a powerful and moving movie if you havnt seen it suggest you go rent it or buy it its a beautiful thing. well ill probably write later today to make up for when im in NYC. later days
