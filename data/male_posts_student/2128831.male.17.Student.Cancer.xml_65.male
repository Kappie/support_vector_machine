It is obvious that this is my God-damn, fucking, bloody site and if you don't like the shit that I present, then pretend it is television and change the fucking channel.  Where else are they hearing this?  Hmmm?  It is obvious that the pussy-fuckers don't have any balls and if they do I am sure they are shrucken and look like raisens because I am damn sure that the only action they have seen are from thier own hands.  It seems some gay-bashing-mentally-rejected-asinine-foolish-dumb-shits-destined-for-the-nine-to-five-job-of-flipping-burgers-at-McDonalds-asshole-cuntbags are activiely presuing a fight with me.  A little word of advise carpet-munchers this is America sweetie, freedom of speech and freedom of press gotta love 'em!  Another small thingie you Neo-hilter wanna-be rejects, in the words of Courtney Love "Fuck Off"!  Random musings, part 2 Ahh... Monday, Monday. Can't trust that day. Since my head's always still foggy on Mondays, let's start off the week with something simple: random crap. Reincarnation: What would you want to come back as in your next life?  Models: Do you respect aspiring models? Shouldn't models feel guilty because their looks had something to do with getting their jobs? (kidding). But seriously, knowing that you're getting a gig based solely on looks - can that really be satisfying? Why is modeling considered a 'profession'? Honestly, I think that's bullshit, but I love Megan, my girl, call me! Beats: Multiple genres of music, or mainly one? First Dates: Ladies, what basic things things do you come to expect on a first date for it to be considered a success? Guys, your perspective? If there's an awkward silence from a lull in the conversation, do you point it out or do you ignore it?  Voltron: Does anyone know why there were two Voltrons? There was one comprised of lions and another made out of automobiles and planes. I'm sure this confused kids 'round the world. The confusion is like to that which I felt prior to learning that Michelle Tanner was played by the Olsen twins. Before this discovery, I thought that Mary-Kate-Ashley Olsen was just one of those really long honky names (i.e. Billy-Bob Thornton, Peggy-Sue Johnson, Betty-Really Humpter). SNL: Will Ferrell or Chris Farley? What would you rather be: A quadriplegic but mentally sound, or mentally retarded but had full use of all your limbs? (don't forget to factor in the ability to masturbate when deciding). Spring: Where the fuck are you, Spring? Winter's acting like the dependent fat girlfriend and overstaying her welcome, again. That bitch.  Dawn of the Dead Review  So in order to swear for a more benign reason, I'll review this steaming pile of this frappucino looking runny human excrement.  First of all, let me clarify a few things. The original Dawn Of The Dead is my absolute favourite zombie movie of all time. Sure some of the special effects and makeup are outdated (ok, they all are) and the soundtrack is filled with a weird pop synth vibe that is often cornier than scary, but it has truly stood the test of time. It still resonates as one of the more socially significant horror movies. It broke the mould blending gore with moral and political commentary. But more importantly it was and is fucking scary. I watched it again on DVD last week and there were 3 or 4 good jump moments, as well as a palpable sense of fear throughout. And keep in mind, I've seen this movie before, several times! But enough about that, I promised a review of some brown substance. So this one opens off well enough, sure the opening isn't NEARLY as scary as the original and offers very little insight into the state of the world, but it does a good job of throwing you right into the mess of a world gone crazy. Sarah Polley (way to go Indie Movie Queen, congratulations on SELLING OUT. Just because the movie was filmed in Canada doesn't mean the $25 Million Dollar Budget qualifies as a small production, which you've always said you will only take part in) is a nurse, her husband and her are attacked by a zombie child and Sarah needs to escape to survive. I'm gonna stop there and tackle my biggest problem with the movie. No spoilers here, promise. Well as you've seen from the commercials, the zombie's are fucking fast! Just like in 28 Days Later, these aren't really traditional zombie's they're more like me after doing a hit of speed. Wait, I don't do speed. They're more like Barry Bonds before a big game. Y'know, what with the steroids and all. Anyhoo, my big problem is that fast zombie's just aren't all that scary. Its more like a mob of people rushing after the characters in the movie. So what does that mean? Its an ACTION movie, not a horror movie. Put aside the communicable nature of zombification and you have an overblown action movie with a bunch of guns, explosions (wait until you see the nuclear-like explosion of a single propane tank), sex, etc. So, mob of people, action movie, that means suspense is up next right? WRONG. There was only one scene (a childbirth scene) that actually held any suspense, mostly cause you were paying attention to all the brains being splattered all over the place instead of the horror of the world that these people were living in. The whole fun of a zombie movie (as opposed to an action movie) is yelling at the characters: "WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING? DON'T JUST STAND THERE WHILE THAT ZOMBIE LUMBERS SLOWLY TOWARDS YOU!!! FUCKING DO SOMETHING!!! SHOOT THAT FUCKING ZOMBIE IN HIS FUCKING ZOMBIFIED HEAD!! DON'T BE FOOLED CAUSE HE LOOKS LIKE YOUR OLD DANCE COACH, HE'S GONNA FUCK EAT YOUR BRAINS AND THEN DISEMBOWEL YOU!!! SERIOUSLY!! WHY AREN'T YOU FUCKING RUNNING OR AT LEAST WALKING AWAY GINGERLY!?!?!?". Without this gut reaction, you might as well just stop making zombie movies. Yes it takes place entirely in a mall. In fact, in a small twist of fate, the mall that they used to film this movie is the mall across the street from the house I grew up in. I probably spent 15 hours a week in that mall growing up, reading comics, playing video games, mugging old ladies, etc. So that part was cool, cause like, y'know it was filmed in the mall I grew up in. Ok, I got nothing. It wasn't all that cool in the end, cause the mall is scheduled for demolition and they didn't use any of the actual stores (not that they are actually still there, hence the demolition). Back to the "yes it takes place.." thing. So the mall is supposed to mean something, but here in this flick its just a place that happens to have locked doors. Sure there's the amusement of watching the guy across the street from a giant mall picking off zombie's from the roof of his gun shop (correct me of I'm wrong American readers, but you don't actually have gun shos on the far edge of a suburbian mall parking lot do you?), but bye bye messages about consumerism and capitalism. Hello jokes about HDTV. Bleh. Fuck off. So all in all, this movie fucking sucked. It was the worst fucking horror remake I've ever seen. And I've seen them ALL. This movie made me want to run outside and chew on peoples shoulders just to see if I could turn them into more entertaining zombie's than the ones in the movie. Oh yah, and for a movie about Zombie's, we saw a grand total of TWO FUCKING PEOPLE lose flesh to zombie's. Not a single disembowlment. I think there was a decapitation, but I've already forgotten. I'd watch it again with a scorecard but I'm afraid that I'd have to fucking disembowel myself after sitting through it again. I hate you hollywood. Way to ruin the legacy of my favourite goddamned voodoo inspired satan worshiping zombie movie. Burn in hell. I'm coming to eat your children.  No mention of Riley sorry!  You all know how much I heart that nigga'.  I will rub it in some more lata'.  *sighs*  FIVE WEEKS UNTIL PROM!  I am excited!
