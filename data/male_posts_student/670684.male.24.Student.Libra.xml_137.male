I, as I usually do, was day dreaming on my commute into work this morning and thought on a subject, so I will share.   When in a social setting and someone asks the inevitable question, "What do you do? / What do you do for a living?", I have now decided to answer in a different way.  A true way.  I have decided, as you might someday, that what I am is not what I do for a living.  It is everything else.  So, what do I do?  I, at least once a day, love to stand in direct sunlight. I enjoy rolling with my seat back and the windows down, weather permitting. I would love nothing more than to never have to leave the comfort of my home. Never having to make a phone call is happiness to me. I would call myself a writer, because, on occassion, I do write, or post at least. I am a dreamer. I Powerlevel.  Any of these, or a variation of, depending on the day, is now an acceptable answer, and one that you would get from me, if you dared ask what I do to Live.  And now, Moe, please follow this up with a link to something, so that we, together, will keep this a blog,and not a forum for my simpler minded posts.
