Anyway, I don't think anyone would know that this blog exists.. so I might as well just write my inner thoughts and feelings here.. if you chance upon this then you're lucky :)  There's four more days left to my mid-year examinations and I haven't started studying yet.. I don't think I'll do well for this exams.. And I didn't know that a birthday present could be so hard to find.. Two birthdays are coming right up and I already spent like a quarter of the holidays trying to find a nice one..
