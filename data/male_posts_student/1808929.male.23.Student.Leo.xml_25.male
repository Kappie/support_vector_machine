I take the bus from east to west campus so that I can go visit Angie one more time and get a picture. Angie and I chat one last time and we take a quick picture. I’m very glad that I was able to have a courteous farewell picture with her. During the week of graduation last year so much was going on that I neglected to say goodbye to Angie. I noticed that one of my earlier pictures was on her wall, which made me glad. Angie kept all sorts of photos of students she knew over the years.  	My mom made some brownies before I left home. I brought them with me to NC and this morning I finished the big one that I brought. They were really good brownies; I brought them from home knowing that I really didn’t want to be spending money on expensive Duke snacks while I was there.  	As I’m working on the ICS presentation for the squad meeting I get a call from Kim, which means that it’s time for me to head over to east campus to meet her for lunch. We meet in front of the West Duke Building on East Campus, which is where we would always meet at the EMT-Basic class for 2 ½ years. We head over to George’s Garage, which was really good. We spend most of the time talking about Kim’s competitive cooking. Her boyfriend and her got started cooking as a couple and have had some recent success. I don’t know that I exactly understand how competitive cooking really works, but she loves it. You know, it’s all about passion. You have to find something you’re passionate about and then go with it. Before we leave we briefly talk about how the squad’s relationship with the EMT class has gone downhill. The squad leadership seems to have this “my way or the highway” mentality that really frustrates Kim and Barbara. I tell her that I’m really full of regret about not leaving the EMT class more settled than it is. Months prior to my graduation I could tell that no one cared about the EMT class as much as I did. She assures me that it wasn’t my fault and that these kinds of phases come and go. The current squad leadership will eventually graduate and others will take charge. I let Kim know that Omaira will be the new training officer and we both hope that she does a better job of working with the system instead of working against it. Change is a gradual process that takes persistent, patient effort. The current squad leadership attempted to push through immediate, instantaneous change and it only created a rift between themselves and the class.  	Sue-Ellen, Dyson, Sunny Wang and I all made arrangements to have dinner this evening. We end up going to Rick’s Diner, which was where I must have eaten 25% of the time when I was a senior. Sunny is still Sunny, very funny and upbeat, but we are both able to commiserate about first-year troubles. Sunny is a first-year at Duke Med and she apparently is dating somebody she met while she worked at a firestation for two years prior to entering med school. I am real happy for her; I realize how much I’ve got to get out and experience new things, see new people. We also talk about trying to find Dyson a job. Sue-Ellen ends up buying mine and Sunny’s dinner because somehow I forgot to bring my money (is this a recurring theme?) and Sunny’s medical school flex doesn’t work at Rick’s for some reason. I need to remember that I owe Sunny about five dollars. Sunny comes to see the first part of the squad meeting before she takes off, probably to go study somewhere.  	Once I get to the EMS meeting the first person I see is Matt Womble. Matt Womble is another very inspiring individual. Why didn’t I make an appointment to go see him this week? I know I thought about it, but I ended up thinking that he’d be too busy to meet. We talk only very briefly and I can tell that he’s starting to get some grey hairs. He is there to answer some initial questions about their MCI drill, which will happen next week. As he leaves he asks how long I will be in town; I tell him that I’m leaving tomorrow and I again I regret having not contacted him about my visit. What was I thinking? I will write him in the near future, for he’s done so much for the squad and me.  	This is going to sound really corny, but I loved giving the ICS presentation and walkthrough this evening. I absolutely love presenting material to people in new ways and then watching them rise to the challenges I present them with. The squad members seemed very attentive and asked good questions. The ICS walkthrough went better than expected. We took it outside and actually put an ICS in place for the triage, treatment, and transport of 15 written mock-patients. It was pretty cool how all I had to do was set the walkthrough up and get it started before it took on a life of its own. What’s amazing to me about ICS is how increasingly complex it can become in a matter of minutes. The amount of communication grows exponentially during that time. I fully believe that this group of EMTs will do fairly well on their drill. Roni Prucz asked quite a bit of questions; he must know that he’s most likely to be the I.C. for the drill. Dave Strauss and others told me afterwards that they were very pleased and pleasantly surprised about how the training went. Ah, how great that felt. I still got the touch, eh?  	This evening I’m staying with Shaomeng Wang. Shaomeng and I were both RA’s in Pegram my junior year. He’s very unlike myself, which is why I think we get along so well. Shaomeng is a “gangsta” who doesn’t like to take crap from nobody. However, he’s also very thoughtful and a loyal friend. He judges people based on their character rather than superficiality, that’s a very admirable trait, especially at Duke. I feel kinda bad about staying with him that evening because he’s got a project due the next day, but I get to talk with him here and there in passing. He’s overly concerned about how comfortable I am and so on and he goes overboard trying to be a good host to me. That was nice and very typical Shaomeng. He tells me about his girlfriend of about 7 months now. She’s a very nice-looking young woman from Singapore, so now we both have dated Singaporeans. He’s going to Chicago next year to start a business job with ambitions to start an MBA in a few years. Very cool. 	The day is winding down and I start feeling a little sad ‘cause tomorrow I will leave. These few days have flown by so fast and I really wasn’t able to complete everything I wanted to complete. I did get to see just about every person I wanted, so that’s a major plus. There’s really only one person left, the queen of busy, my old crew 1 member, and “my baby momma,” Jen Farrell.
