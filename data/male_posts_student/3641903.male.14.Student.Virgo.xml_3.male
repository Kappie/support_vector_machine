I ate my breakfast and had to take the MRT to Dohby Ghaut there to go to the Sinngapore Red cross society which is behind Park mall to start my standard first aid course, i need to complete this course so that i can be a fully qualified medic in the Barracudas. ok back to where i left out, so i went into the building and god seriouly it was dam old, old in a sense like it was a World War 2 ers type of building and also, even though i was there on time, the whole dam class was dam empty and i was the first person to arrive there, the rest of them came at about 15 minutes later. At first i felt dam extra as every one of them came in large groups, but i am the only idiot there with no one of my friends and GOD the gals there are DAM CHIO, i really mean seriously DAM CHIO!!!! ok so in the end everyone found out i was there to learn to become a medic due to a introduce yourself session, also a lot of them came from differrent places, like JC's, Poly's and secondary schools like Zhenghua and first Sengkang secondary and god i tell you all the gals there are REALLY DAM CHIO. Wait till the rest of the Barracudas hear about this then they will envy me that i made friends with everyone in the class including the chio gals plus even got their email ads and phone no.'s muhahahahahahahahahahahahaha. ok right back to the topic, well today in the course i learnt the different bandages, position, types of injuries and also did a lot of practical of bandaging people, too bad my partner is not a chio gal but i am gald to have this nice man who is a lecturer with his poly students having the course and god his studnets are dam chio and also not forgetting his dam suai male students. So tommorrow i am going back for the 2nd day of the course and then the 3rd day is the test then i will be the only qualified medic in the Barracudas muahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!! and also entry is about th gonna see the same chio gals!!! ok so this whole entry is about the chio gals!!!!
