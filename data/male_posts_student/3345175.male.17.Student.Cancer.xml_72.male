Right, so first Daniel. *Sighs again* We seem to have drifted...we aint spoken as much recently, he hasnt texted me, he's started doing blogger entries without me mentioned in them (:'( That just doesnt happen! Its creepy! Anywayz, we dont seem as close as we were. He seems to be treating me more like a friend that he's just flirty with. Which im kool with, but i wish he would just tell me how he feels. I have no problem with it if thats what is to happen, coz friends is all we can be to each other right now. But he seems to not be as attentive as he once was. I kinda miss talking to him.   And secondly, the person who i will refer to as *someone* (since thats how he likes to refer to me on his LiveJournal). Someone likes me. Apparently. And ive liked someone for sooooooo long (did i already talk bout him on here?). I seriously used to fancy him rotten, and recently have started to rediscover this. I'm goin to the Catty tomorrow before Ali's P.A.R.tay, and he'll be there and its all exciting and stuff and AAAAAARRRRGGGHHHHH!!!! I dont know wot im doing anymore!!!! How many people can i fuck about?!?!  One thing though - if this thing with someone gets anywhere past this (which i sooo pray to the God i dont believe in that it does), fucking about would be NOWHERE on the cards. Man i like him so freakin much.
