No complaints except most of the third trumpets won't play anything and when they do it isn't very loud, so, Anthony and I, well, more myself, have to blast to compensate for the rest of them but at the same time it has encouraged me to practice a bunch which is always a good thing. It's going to be interesting at band camp during sectionals but it is going to be sweet regardless of whatever might happen.  The over all mood this year seems really mellow. Maybe it's just me but it seems calm. I think the outrages number of freshman and over all rookies have something to do with that. The music is pretty different from the past two years but it is pretty easy. Memorizing it shouldn't be a problem either. I'm first chair third trumpet, something I think I forgot to mention in the first paragraph. Our section leaders kick hash. (Craig, Jay, and Ryan.) The trumpet section is kicking hash. I pissed off Sara the second day, lol, but other then that everything is falling together nicely as far as I'm concerned. We have two songs played all the way through. Nobody knows exactly how many songs we are playing this year so it might be four like usual or it might only be three this year. Time will tell. I was a little worried Monday and Tuesday when a handful of people weren't there because of a church camp but yesterday we had a full house and it was sweet, or shall I say  'Cool' ? That was gay but I don't think anyone would understand it unless they are marchers anyways. Well, I don't have much to say. Looking forward to practice again today, not so much the meeting about band camp next week though. All the stuff is probably going to be the same old same old but you never know. Cheers!
