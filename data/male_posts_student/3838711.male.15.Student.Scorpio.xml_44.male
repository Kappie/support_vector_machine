Just a jiffy. But, I dont expect this to happen now...  School was per normal, and I got back my Maths test.... 6/20. Disappointing. Didnt expect this kind of results.... at least a 11. Ah well... Just had to accept it. Later at 12.10, we had our Chinese test, and I could handle most of the questions (even though I did answer every one), but just had this feeling that some answers were wrong, not confident enough to get it right.. But well.. I did my best.  Sherman still didnt pay up, he used my money to go see the doctor yesterday (-.-") . And a rare sight of him too, bringing a hp to school... was supposed to be a Panasonic X300, but it became a Siemens ST60. Lol, hes blur.... haha. On the way home, he was like receiving sms-es from his gf, all were so sweet and full of concern for him... man... I wonder whats the chemistry that makes us good friends... 1 having the nourishment of love, and 1 lacking it big time... haha.. dont know la... confusing...  So we spent around an hour and a half in my house, playing and listening to songs. After that we headed to Serangoon Stadium, for our dreaded 2.4km NAPFA test... the sun was scorching hot, pierced my skin like needles.... pain sia... Then after that I somehow decided to walk home, not take the bus like I normally do, but called Willy along too, to Upper Serangoon Shopping Centre to check out the games shop. But it was closed from yesterday till Wednesday... So yeah, we left with nothing to see... Gonna check it out soon...  Back home, I just bathed and started to get settled down and do my stuff when Aaron rang me up. Called me to have a meal with them at Kovan Heartland Mall, so I thought, why not, since its so near. Again, walked down to Kovan.. I wonder whats with me today... Walking all the time... haha... Maybe I felt good when I walked home last Friday night... But that time was so cool and windy, not like today, humid, and hot. Coupled with the disgusting smell of vehicles' exhausts. (>.  When I got back home, my mum told me, my godfather aint gonna make it through anymore.. Blood pressure going down, discharged blood, and whole body going weak and a unclear state... When I heard this, I was deeply saddened, and I wanted to go see him for the one last time.. But I could not as I have school tomorrow... I feel so.. useless... not being able to see him for one more time, if not the last. My mum's off to the hospital now, only me left in the house, blogging it out...  Life and death are part and parcel of life... But why does it strike so suddenly... His condition deteriorated so quickly within 2 days... Making my mum in a dilemma, as shes got a night part time job too.. so now she has to decide whether to go or not... And me, all shagged out today... with the run and all.. Wanted to go see but couldnt.. Got physics test tomorrow.... Sigh. Life....  I just wonder.. looking back at all the Tuesdays' archives... Things always crop up on Tuesdays, and the most events pass by me on this day. Maybe its destiny ? Fate ? I dunno... feels so strange... yet it has a tingling of coincidence....
