Anyway, back to my point, so i'm just rounding up for the night, clearing away my notes and clutter that's strewn across the desk. I had dinner and everything while sitting here at this darned computer ! A thing i hate doing, but hey, i had to work. So after a delightful meal of spinach and ricotta canneloni my mouth tasted weird,that way that after you've eaten something and then WHAM a big minging taste seeps in, maybe its me, you know what i mean ? Anyway i went next door to the bathroom to brush my teeth, and not knowing that my sister's boyfriend was in residence i had the misfortune of walking in on him taking a pee... i don't think i've ever been so embarrassed in my life... i know what your thinking - he should have locked the damn door,  but then he didn't think that i was in..........wait a minute, that's no excuse, he still should have locked the damn door ! If there happen to be any psychiatrists, psychologists or any other form of mental health professional reading this blog right now, it would be nice to talk about my mental scar. I don't think i'll ever look at the guy in the same way again, probably because i'll never be in the same room as him again.
