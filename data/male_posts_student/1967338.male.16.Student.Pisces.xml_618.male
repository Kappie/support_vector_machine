It sounds lame, but that's exactly what it has been. Fun. I'm running out of computer time, so full details will be posted later, possibly in Zion.   Bye! See y'all in August!  Behold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlett letter, and, of a truth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlett letter running by her side! Come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them!
