Perhaps there's an event, such as Mother's Day or Easter, where everyone works, and so the interaction is at its maximum for all characters. The main characters are the focus of the plot, and the support cast are there to make things funny and interesting.       Basil: Hates the job, and swears that today is his last day here, then again that's what he says everyday.   Todd: Today is the day he finds out whether or not he becomes the new Asst. Mgr. Needless to say, his nerves are on edge.    Hugo: Terribly depressed over his situation, he meets a guest whom offers him an opportunity with a twist.   Roger: He is determined to solve today's crossword puzzle, even if it kills him.   Emrah: A bit of a mystery, yet outgoing and witty. He's foreign, Turkish, so that makes him funny by default. Not sure if he should be a main character yet.   Ty: He's on his way out, hence Todd impending promotion. Today, he doesn't give a shit what happens, and revels in the chaos that ensues.   Charlie: O-Oh, there's that stalker again! A guest who won't take no for an answer badgers the shit out of Charlie, so she spends the whole day dodging this guy.   That's it for today: Next up. Todd's anecdotes.
