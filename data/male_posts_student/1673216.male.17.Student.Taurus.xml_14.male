I'm not moving to Las Vegas anymore :D  So yea... It's because some guy freaked out, called the deal off (ok well he just pushed it back, but because of school there was no time for this). This was AFTER my house was put up for sale. AFTER about 5 people had looked at it. AFTER we bought an apartment dealy in Vegas. AFTER we had planned on leaving in a week. Yes, this is a huge shock..  Sorry if you're mad that you didn't get rid of me. I'm like a bad itch I just don't go away ;)
