I mean people make fun of her and she really is cool. But that's the way my fucking school works, the rich preppy ones rule the world or rather they rule the ones that let them rule them, if that makes any sense lol. And they go and judge everyone else and want you to try so hard to impress them or else you're shunned upon. I really havent met anybody at Ballard, with obvious exceptions of some, that has really been down to earth and not all I'm better than you. They can all fuck off seriously. FUCK OFF all of you bastards. Sometimes I walk through the halls thinking to myself if I want to kill the people that pass me. Usually I do. A lot of them are black people yelling stupid meaningless jibberish in their little ebonics but a lot of them I know and hate and others are just asses I hate.
