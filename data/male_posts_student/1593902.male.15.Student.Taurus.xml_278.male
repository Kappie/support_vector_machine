I got an A in the class which is what I wanted, I've met a lot of new friends, i've reaquainted with people, Meli and Joanna mostly, I've spent time thinking, lots of it.  I feel I understand meself a ton better.  I'm one hundred percent sure that i'll be fine now.  I haven't been able to say that for about 4 years.  I'm gonna be cool, and i'm gonna own.  I have that new attitude, about somethings i'm the same, mostly caus that's me (and i'm always right).  I've figured things out that i prolly wouldnae have before.  It's good.  Life is calm it's fun, it's intriguin but it's SAFE.  One developement i don't like is the fact that me two closest friends i barely talked to, but that's life, one's busy with her boyfriend whom she "loves" (i'm using quotations for this love cause she got over her last love, in approx. a week. lol. (exxaggeration)).  THe other decided she'd go to venezuela and spend most the summer there, the cunt. But I'm ok with it cause i've talked to her in bits and pieces. and i've seen her a couple of time  (web cams own).  The main thing is i'm comfy with myself now. Am I social? no. Do i like social gatherings? no. Will I go to the mall more? Priolly.  I'm also cool with weaing make up.   When i'm forced by three girls to do so!  and yes I may date, once school starts, depending on how school goes.  A well.  One thing that's made me TOTALLY HAPPY. that's not Gisselle is.   NCAA football 2005. It's brought me back to 6th grade, when i CRIED for the hurricanes. It's brought back memories, mostly positive, and iunno.  Life equals good.  People equal=okie.  Video games = good.  and another thing.  Jonh Kerry was fookin brilliat (and Obama).  I saw it that night, and i'm hoping he'll keep it going. If he wins i will officially run aroundnaked to Shakira.  Well maybe not teh Shakira part.
