Team members will regularly chime in when they want to post their opinions on a variety of subjects, either agreeing, or disagreeing with me. If you wish to join my team either contact me on aim, or post a comment on this particular post stating your email, so that you may apply.  Aim Screen Name: Stingray7488  Thank you for your time, and I look forward to a very lively and opinionated blog. As you might have noticed, the blogs are posted most up to date to most out of date, therefore the actual first post is near the bottom of your window. I might suggest you working your way up the post section if you wish to maintain an understanding of the current events in the blog. Thank you.            Shatt
