Don't leach off of others' work. Write a story. Make it about  something , then when it's all over and done with be proud of what you've created. I'm in a funk right now. I need a change of direction. A fresh perspective is what I need. I've rearranged my bedroom, relocating my computer to my basement to allow myself to occupy my time other ways. I've started reading, and I never used to read before. I'm rewatching movies and uncovering everything I may have missed in previous viewings. I'm listening to music I used to say I hated. I've been trying my hardest to appreciate all art (film, music, literature, and the  art  you're probably thinking of) for the good in it rather than the bad, so I've stopped hating everything other people have created (unless of course ignorance was involved in the creation process). Because of this I've developed, for the first time in my life, a true sense of respect for people as artists (respect towards individuals as human beings is another thing). Nothing has  clicked  yet. I know it's coming though. {{ I wrote a lot here, then I decided it was booring, so you don't get to see it.}}
