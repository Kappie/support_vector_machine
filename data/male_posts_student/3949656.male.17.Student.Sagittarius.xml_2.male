In the Collected World (CW) universe, a scientist working with sub-atomic  particles has accidentally created a minute tear in the fabric of  space-time. From this tear, the entire fabric of the CW universe will begin  to unravel. The majority of the story will follow inhabitants of CW as they  drop through into other universes, or universes show through the holes.  The world at large was unaware that the universe was destabilising, in  fact the scientist who caused it didn't know. The evidence only becomes  clear when the president of the united states drops into another dimension  during a political broadcast, aides on either side and cameras rolling.  Once the world begins to wake up to the fact their reality is leaving  them, there will be mass riots. Children will, with their limited grasp of  reality, be the first to spot a new hole or window. Windows will be oddly  placed items that disappear when not looked at from the right angle, holes  can appear anywhere and may alter the existing reality around themselves.
