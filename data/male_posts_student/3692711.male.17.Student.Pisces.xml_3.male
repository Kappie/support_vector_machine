Upon reaching there, Mr Hilbert briefly tell us about the cave, what water will flow into it when that place rain, what they put sulphur there already to "chase away" the crawlies. Then before we leave our resort, Mr Ng even ask us to bring a touch with us. Then, we are even asked to pull our socks over our trackpants....  Okae, next, we are led to a part of the forest where Mr Hilbert says it is the way to the cave. We stop there and he start to brief us again. He tells us that there is this ruin house above the cave with a weeping willow tree there. In another words, the entrance of the cave there is haunted. So, we are given a blind flod to cover our eyes, not to see these "dirty" things...  Then, after we are blind folded, we are led to another part of the forest and are told that the cave is a few metres away. Then, one by one enter the cave. I am led to the raffia string and are told to bend down to go into the cave and are to be remained low thru'out the journey. I slowly walk in as I hold onto the string tightly.  In fact, I am very scare . I dont know where am I and where my friends are. I continue walking, then, I realise that the raffia string is "gone", so I call for my friends behind and can hear them coming towards me. Then, i feel the end, then I am sort of " Huh? How come there's a small tree ?" At first I thought there's water, maybe there's small trees or bush. Then, I feel the continuation of the string and started to walk. I use my legs to brush the ground in front of me to see if there is any steps or slopes. BUT the thing is there's lots of dried leaves on the ground. I am like, " Okae, must be the water brush all the leaves in ." Then I continue, I can feel the sunlight and I thought that's the end of the trail or there are pockets of holes on the cave ceiling. Then, i ignore it and keep going. I almost fall when i come to a slope, then I am like, " wow, cave has slopes ." Thru'out the journey, I keep myself low. In the end, they unfolded me and I look back.... " OMG!! NOT A CAVE!! " Heex! I feel so cheated man~~  BUT, thru'out this activity, I discover and understand alot of things. Actually,  we tend to depend on our other senses when our sense of sight is "removed".  I also found and confirmed that,  actually, I am scare of being alone, dont know where am I and what will happen next . AND,  i really trust others too much and too easily, without realising it is a lie  -_____-"  Net, we have our lunch and went back for a talk. the talk is on commercial logging and sustainable forest management. I realise that they way they do is quite environmental friendly. Then, they also split the areas into compartments for research and logging purposes.  Due to being very sleepy during the talk, they teach us a game call "Judge, Hunter, Bear" Well, I know and had played this game BUT I never knoe that we are enjoying ourslves!!  Next, we have another 2 talks on how to be a good tour guide. From these talks, though they are in Malay and i fell asleep several times, I learn alot of things. Learn some points that I even never learn in school and can be used in PW oral presentation.
