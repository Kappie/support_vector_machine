My friend Amanda is only going ot be their for a couple hours (needs to go to some party)  we're only seeing my cousin for dinner.  and my least favorite cousins are going to be their for much much too long.    plus...after you've been to Newyork enough their is nothing exciting really about it. Cheap sunglasses, bags, and watches...oh and don't forget dvds...but otherwise it's not exiciting...it's living.
