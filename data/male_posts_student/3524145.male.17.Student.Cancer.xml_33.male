" Lose Your Old Self For A New Life " ...remind me of someone telling me this... you have to lose your old self to become who God wan you to be.... get away from the sinful nature... and start walking towards Lord Jesus... hrm... Hope this hair cut is a new change in me...  Today... during cell group i think i also wierd wierd de... whole day seems very heavy.... seems be out of God's presence... think i am very distracted... thinking of alot of things... very out of mind... i dun even know what i am thinking about... just dun seems to be able to concentrate my mind on God... during cell group ... while leading the P  W... seems very lost of words... dun seems to be able to lead well... seem very demoralise... very down... then during the SNL... seems to have something in my heart... but just dunno whats going on... just can't feel him... maybe i haven seek Him enough... just Pray that i can go back near to Him again...
