Anyway life, problems, problem: alice, why the hell block me for no reason? hmm i feel like your avoiding me for no reason, ah well going to poland should be good nothing to worry about till i get back, but then your in majorica so ha, no need to worry about that till end of august, that'll be a wit of my shoulder, be it only temperary but still better than nout. Dam it i dont want to think at this time of night, ah well i have a stomach ache now for no reason :( i also have 2 mic's at my computer and my digital camera set up as a webcam and my music on loud and my phone on charge, eeek
