So do the smart thing, take a day off to read a book, go out with your significant other, write a story, sing a song, practice your skills...whatever you want. "Let's stop praying for someone to save us, and start saving ourselves. Let's stop this and start over. Let's go out--let's get going."--KMFDM "Dogma"
