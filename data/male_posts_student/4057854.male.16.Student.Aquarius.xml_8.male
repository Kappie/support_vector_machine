The problems apply to Internet Explorer 5.01, 5.5, and to IE 6.0, said the security firm late today.  But Microsoft has plugged the holes, which allow alien surfers to mess with your machine.  The "exploits" include bypassing the so called "zone restrictions" and there's a boundary error exploit too. Microsoft has patched the patches, and there's more information at the Secunia website, here, as well as at Microsoft.com.  The list is lengthy. Patch as you must.   Thanks to  urlLink The Inquirer  for the info   Some more reasons to stop using Internet Explorer and start using alternatives such as Firefox.
