There were plenty of fun-filled events like "Orange Pass", "Scooter Relay", and "Clothing Relay." As you can tell by the descriptive titles, these events might have been the most fun I've had. Who am I kidding. Today sucked. The events were stupid. My class spent many days after school working on our hallway decorations and our lip sync. But nevertheless, we didn't win. Our hallway decoration was ok, but it still sucked. And our lip sync was plain terrible. So yeah. Gold and White day is for losers. The local band, Neötærik performed today. Very good. I enjoyed the performance alot. Nice job guys. So tomorrow is Thanksgiving. I'm really not too excited. What is there to get excited about? Stuffing my face with food is a routine for me so that's nothing special.  Listen to H.I.M.
