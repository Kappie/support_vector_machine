Then the wave strikes you, a thousand crazed teenagers like a mob of bipolar disordants collectively hitting mania. Summer is here.  I'm slightly depressed though. I cheated in the Brothers Karamozov. I read up to a point, then read the epilogue. Now I fear that the greatest part happened in that gray, unlearned space between reading endpoint and epilogue. Damn my great culmanation of vices, addictions, and desires which prevented me from a full blown Karamozov binge! Trust me when I say, BK is no action thriller. It goes on a seductively slow and intriguing pace. Still, it is worth reading. Many aspects of the book apply to my life: the spiritual searching of Alyosha, the sensualist needs of Fyodor and Mitya, the confused attempts of reading complex literature by Kolya (this struck me as ironic).  We bought Pitch Black yesterday. For those of you who do not know my family, my father, brother and I are deadly sci-fi fans. I enjoyed Pitch Black and find it suspisious that it came out in the same era as The Matrix. Such a lovely action flick was engulfed in the great mania of tight leather and disposable weaponry that is The Matrix. I find it interesting that both movies have religous overtones similar to my beliefs while still greatly different: Pitch Black being tinged with Islam and The Matrix holding to Gnostic Christianity and Buddhism. Pitch Black has a great deal more swearing in it, as well as a deal more blood (you ever realize that? The Matrix had some heavy battle shots but little gory mangled bodies or great blood splatters common to action/sci-fi/fantasy), but it still has good points on the philosophy of human nature. Men naturally tend to kill to save themselves, but there is the rare self-sacrifice. I believe all truly selfless acts are God-called in some way. Even the greatest atheist can be called to serve God in a selfless act, and thus reflect his greatness in that way. Hmmm...  Bought a CD by Disciple today. Now, it is ironic that I bought it the same day I skimmed a book called Tattoed and Unglued or somesuch. The book decryed the actions and dress of the Underground or Counterculture of today. Mostly I agree. Drugs, swearing, and sketchy theological basing is prevalent underground. But not everywhere. There are Christians who dress and act different than the mainstream. I am becoming one of these, what with my Hot Topic T-shirts and soon to be sexy dreads (my book is in and I shall buy it tomorrow! Huzzah!). Even some of the Christian apparral in Hages' is dark and smacking of Goth undertones. I strongly cry that one should never judge any book by its cover. Goth can be a theologian. But I digress. The CD gave me a minor headache. It is loud, angstful, and filled with guitars, drums, and guttural screams. I love it.  I started The Institutes of Christianity by John Calvin for real this time. I like the way he views his own book. He does not claim to add anything to the Bible, finding it infallible and beautiful. He does not even claim responibility for his doctrinal interpretations, calling upon the Divine for guidance and goodness in his writing. He writes this as a guide to the Bible to help "those who would study the path of salvation". That's me.
