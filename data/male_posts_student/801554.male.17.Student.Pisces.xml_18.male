Well, I've finished that in a week, and I have now gone BACK to the first Discworld novel (actually, novels, the copy I got from the library is the first two books combined.),  The Colour of Magic  and  The Light Fantastic .  I've been on a back and forth journey around this series.  I think my first was  The Truth , which I've been told is not a good one to start with, since it is a different point of view than the others.  Thinking back, I can remember what I was thinking of it, that it was humorous, but in an engrossing way, not a laugh-out-loud way.
