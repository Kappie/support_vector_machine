As he is someone we all know and love(or like a lot, for us males), we should all extend the same invitation to him.  The same goes for all our friends.  This is too awesome for us to not share it with those we share our lives with.  And for those of us not in the know(namely the unhip/uncool), I am not referring to  urlLink DiGiorno  the Pizza, I'm referring to the kid with the tongue.
