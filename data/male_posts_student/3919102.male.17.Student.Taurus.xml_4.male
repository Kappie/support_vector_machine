DAMN, that was basically the whole blog... lol  yeaahhhh.... Simone...(gosh i wrote a lot) ok "back to the beggining" i just read simones blog... it basically was about me for today. it was about the whole "us not talking anymore" thing. its weird... i wish things were different, but at the same time, i am having fun with phylicia, and simone jsut seems to keep getting meaner. like on the phone on saturday...friday... no saturday. she was yelling at me about me being wrong about her tryna play me, (tho i still think she DID even if it wasnt on purpose). she was yelling and crying and yelling and tryna make me feel wrong for assuming... but FUCK THAT! i wasnt wrong for a assuming... everyone got that SAME message. so we were talking and i was like "well how am I wrong, everyone agreed with me, i had a right to feel like i was getting played" and she actually said what i didtn think anybody would say without joking... she was like "well everyone is wrong except me!" so at that point, i was like "YUP! forget it!".... now i  read her blog, and shes saying how she doesnt even care. it doesnt really make any sense... but yeah, let me get back to you all nosey people later
