I actually think they were more happy to see me than i them - I met a friend of mine's family and they seem really awesome - i actually am thinking about going out there for church on Sundays. The Pastor graduated from the first college that i attended "Northland Baptist Bible College" I actually miss portions of that University, I have friends there that finally graduated and are now in the field of Christian Service - maybe one day down the road i will meet them again. If not, there's always heaven.  Right now i'm reading a book called the  Da VInci Code  it's a relatively good book - except it's making me doubt some of my beliefs that i've been raised with - which i don't appreciate, sure it means i'm a critical reader - but the delusions put forth in this book are written in such a way that a lesser CHristian could be caught up in the lies.  Anyone reading this , please know i need prayer - i just found out that i'm moving into my Fraternity house for this year - it's the only way i can stay @ school that i know of. I so much want to be a strong Christian, but in the presence of so many non - Christians my faith has to be deeply grounded ----> This is my one prayer, that i will be a light in the darkness and won't be consumed by the darkness. Jesus loves you, now i must go to class . Have a great day - Travis
