Dont know what the hell i'm gonna do with it, but at least now i gots a place to rant and rave about all sorts of crazy bullshit.  like right now, im watchin game 1 of the lakers/pistons nba finals series.  s'pretty good, so far.  i really think detroit's got a legitimate chance to win this series.  they're doin what i think they should do: defend hard, and force bryant to be a ball hog and take bad shots.  anyways, im gonna keep watchin.  peace
