Then at about noon Tyke's grandma arrived but his mom was gone so he had to do a bunch of other things while she was there. Basically the rest of the day wasn't fun except for when Tyke went outside and sunned for about half an hour. It was really nice. Once he started sweating he felt really cool and there was a bit of a breeze so it was really nice. There's two straight sentences ending with it was really nice. Make it 3. It was coincidental though. After his sun experience he took a shower and when he got back upstairs more family had arrived so he chatted a bit but then had to get ice. Then he got back and had to go to Costco with his brother. Then he came home and was done for a while but later on he had to get more ice. These errands though were the best part of the day cuz he got to get out and listen to music loud with the wind in his hair (or A/C) and just let loose. The party was fun though. Two family friends (which are basically family) and Tyke's dad's brother and wife came over. So Tyke got some more presents (read: money) and it was great to just catch up. Tyke and Bob Barker Kabuki (BBK) who Tyke talked about last night got to talk again. They both go off to college in less than a month so they'll try to fit in a hang out sometime before that. After the party Tyke just sat and had a beer. Or he tried one. Didn't like it. Was gonna have a Corona earlier but forgot so he settled for some other crap and he didn't like it.Never has Tyke been a big beer fan. He doesn't like the smell, taste, or anything about it other than carrying it around in a bottle. For some reason that makes Tyke feel important. Tyke just changed the title of his blog because he realized this blog sucks. So he better go to bed now which means that he has to turn around and walk 4 feet cuz he's sleeping on the couch while his grandma is in his room. And to make things worse her dog smells like shit and has stanked up the whole downstairs. Not to mention the intense shedding this dog is going through. Tyke hasn't seen this much hair since his cousins got here (and boy do they have a lot of hair on their heads). Then again, one of them has been approached multiple times to model so looks like Tyke shouldn't be talking bad. One more day then Tyke can go back to his normalcy. Getting up at 2 and not doing anything all day. Ahhh, that's the life.
