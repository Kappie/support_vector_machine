He just decided to talk for the whole period, about the most boring things on Earth with his offensive and ridiculous opinions. So I asked to go the bathroom, and he doesn't even notice as I take my backpack with me. Which takes me here.  So if you ever have "Dr. Vass" as a substitute, just ask to go the bathroom, and you'll be the hero of your whole class.
