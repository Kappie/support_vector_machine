Today he got up late and did nothing all day other than lay out in the sun for a while and try his best to eat some stuff.  He did get a call from Tina though in the early evening.  They chatted for a couple of minutes and then decided that they wouldn't be able to hang out until next Monday at the earliest.  So they still don't have definite plans but they do both want to see each other.  They haven't even seen each other once this whole summer!  Yeah, that's not any different than any other summer but this is a different summer.  And they have a different relationship now anyway.  But aside from that conversation Tyke spent his day just with himself and his mom at home doing work.  He watched the All-Star game later on and then he and Kinker set up a hangout.  Kinker came over and they started by playing some 2 person Risk.  Tyke won easily because they played Capitals and Tyke got both Asia and Europe so he got 19 armies to start and he easily was able to get to Kinker's capital.  Once they were about to start a second game good old Amed strolled on in.  So they bagged that for a new game with all 3.  This time it was much different.  Amed and Tyke were both stuck next to each other in North America.  They had some struggles to hold on to territories but eventually Tyke made the smart move to retreat out of his capital and into his stronghold in Kamchatka on the other side of the world.  There he sat while he took over Africa with the last remaining armies he had.  Then he just sat in Kamchatka until Amed had to leave because of his inability to close a garage door and Dr. Phil came over at the same time.  They decided to bag the game with Amed getting last place and Kinker winning.  Then they played 31, for real money.  They each bought in 5 bucks and then made 10 stacks.  They ended up playing for an hour and 40 minutes.  Tyke lost once and bought back in.  Then he became very powerful and got close to taking out Kinker when he lost power.  Dr. Phil ended up being strong again and then Kinker went out and 2 hands later so did Tyke.  So Dr. Phil won 15 there.  Then they played "best out of 3" hold'em.  And of course Dr. Phil came from behind to win 2 in a row and take that series.  So then they played Shithead and Tyke finally won!  He won all 3 games they played.  Even if there is only a loser (shithead) Tyke still won all 3 games.  It was satisfying.  So now Tyke has to get up before 8 in the morning and go get his stitches out.  Yay for Tyke!
