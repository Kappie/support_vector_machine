I'm proud.  Just did one thing wrong, but it was just a little minor thing.  Nothing to make me fail the thing.  It was extremely easy (not hatein' on anyone who has failed it in the past).  I found out it isn't as hard as you would imagine.  If you haven't gone to take yours in fear of not passing go take it crazy hobo.  I haven't got my hard copy licience yet, but tomorrow I will and I'll update the site with a picture of it and all since I didn't have a picture to publish today.  Picked up the forms I need for my hardship so I'll be able to drive to school this year so that will be cool.  Go me!  This is about I'll I've got to say for today, 'till tomorrow!  urlLink
