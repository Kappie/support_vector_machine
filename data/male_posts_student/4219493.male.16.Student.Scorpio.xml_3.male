You've probably came here via  urlLink http://www.ydkjforum.cjb.net  or  urlLink http://www.mystcommunity.com  . That or a couple of mini-forums i'm on. If you've never seen these forums, check 'em out! Just don't do anything crazy while you're there. That's my job.  This blog will be a fresh mix... my attempts at humour mixed with snippits of my real life. Warning: It might get dark at times. You've been warned.  I'll also do some random stuff, like sharing some favorite web pages, what games i'm playing, what mods for games i'm using, what music i'm listening to, etc.  Prett crappy for a first post, huh? Don't worry... the best is yet to come.
