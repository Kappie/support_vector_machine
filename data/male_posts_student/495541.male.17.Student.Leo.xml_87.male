I say that with determination in the fact that either I am going to fix it or force someone else to fix it!  Tonight was good.  I actually got my homework done pretty early.  I'm going in early for Geometry.  I hope that I can keep up with my schedule.  I was just up in my room a few minutes ago looking at some of my books.  It's been a long time since I'd actually had spare time to sit down and read.  I got out an old book on basketball.  I have no idea where it came from.  I was just reading it a bit and noticing how almost all the drills in it were ones we do in practice.  Weird.  I somehow felt inspired to do some of the things in the book.  All that dispite the fact that I dispise hard drills because they make my knees hurt.  To me, it seems like a new hurt feeling.  You normally say hurt like aches  pain after a hard workout, but every now and then I get weird feelings in my knees like they can't support as much weight.  It's like doing shadow squat (squat without weight on the bar) after practice is hard because my knees just seem to want to give out after I go down about halfway.  It's probably just me, but I thought I'd say that anyways.  I'm not one to complain, but I think I have a right to say something when I think it could be a problem.  I didn't mention practice today.  I think it was pretty bad.  I don't know how, but I started off with a good feeling about practice after school.  We started off by running extra because coach thought we weren't going as fast as we should in dribble warm-up.    I need to go to bed, my mother says.  I suppose I could explain more later, but I'd be lying if I told you I would for sure.  Oh by the way, I am MC Hipster.   urlLink [Link]   "..Oh take me back to the start I was just guessing At numbers and figures Pulling your puzzles apart Questions of science Science and progress Do not speak as loud as my heart Tell me you love me Come back and haunt me Oh and I rush to the start"  Song of the moment: "The Scientist" by Coldplay  Good night.
