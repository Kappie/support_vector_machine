However, to my dismay, the stiffs at EA Sports dellayed the release of the computer version of the popular video game until September 9th. I was nearly in tears... What game was I going to play when I got back to my house? I went to J-crew to try and think things off, and got a nice tie there (althought it wasn't the one I wanted) and my short term memory sudenly kicked in. I remembered that just a few hours earlier I had a red an article about this computer game about political campaigning. It had seemed hilarious, with the capabilities of pitting thomas jefferson against  the "guvanator" I laughed whole heartedly. Naturally at this point I felt the distinct need to buy it. I rushed back to EB, past the pack of gigling girls (by now they had recognized me) I pushed aside a small child (not really, but it makes it dramatic does it not?) and picked out the game.      From then on, it was bliss. In my first campaign, I ran myself against the guvanator, and lost. But it was close. I would have one, if not for Ahnould's last minute grab of new york. I even won Texas! In my second game, I possessed the poise and experience nesecairy to win it all. I clobbered Barbara Bush. She won Montana, Colorodo, and South Carolina... That was it! I finished with over 500 electoral votes, and over 95 million popular votes.. I was trully the champion. Today I will embark upon a campaign that features appearances on "Night time, with Fred Toppel" "The O'maley Factor" "Hardhitter" "Barry King Live" "60 Seconds" and of course "Barbara Sawyer".. The Political machine is simply a marvelous game, and I recomend it to anybody, whether interested in politcs or not.      To summarize, 8th grade girls need to stop giggling whenever they see me, EA Sports is a bunch of stifs, and "The Political Machine" is the best game of all time, not Madden 05'
