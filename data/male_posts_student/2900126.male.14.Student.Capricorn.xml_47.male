If you haven't seen "Secret Window" already you should see it, in my eyes that movie was great, it may have started off a little slow but it gets better as you watch. The only thing I don't get is, why did he grow corn where he buried the bodies? Because if he ate the corn (which he did) in each ear of corn there would be pieces of her in it. I loved the way they made John Shooter's character because the man that played him he actually seems like he could be a crazy person and when they showed Morton rainy and his "other half" or the side that was trying to tell him that he actually did all those things, that part was awesome because it showed you that he was crazy or whatever. I don't know why and don't ask me why but sometimes crazy people, in movies, seem cool to me for some odd reason. Well anyway, I guess I said all that to say that I like that movie.
