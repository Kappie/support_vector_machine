We were in the CVNRA (national park) which was kinda cool and we say this big falls thingy neither of us had seen before. Fun times eh.  Yesterday had to work becuase I'm taking wednesday off. We worked the PRIDE parade and event and it was actually alot of fun. Got to hang out with one of the directers and some of the crew that I wanted to get to know more. I think we were there for a little under 6 hours but it was fun anyway, plus it didnt really seem like it. So, there ya go. Oh yeah. I saw alot of people from school there. Just thought I'd mention it. Car.
