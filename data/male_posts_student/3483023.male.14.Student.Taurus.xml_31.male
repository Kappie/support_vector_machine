I Recently Figured Out Our New Neigboors (We Live In A Apartment, They Live On Top Of Us) Are College Students, And So Far I Can Tell There Are Going To Be Atleast 3 People Living Above Us. This Is Going To Have College Students Living Above Us, NOT! They Are Already Louder Then Day, And They Leave And Go Like 500 Times A Day! I Will Be Glad To Get Away From Them When School Starts, I Hope That The Local College Starts School Before We Do Though! GoodBye World, Talk To Ya Later!
