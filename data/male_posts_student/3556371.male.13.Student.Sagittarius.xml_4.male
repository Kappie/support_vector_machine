It's weird; apart from Tuesday (The day when it suddenly dawns on you that you've got the whole week to go: Monday's just 'Ug' day.), Sunday's my least favorite day, yet I was born on a Sunday. Ironic. I was actually due on Friday the 13th, but I was 2 days late. I've only had 2hrs sleep in over 48 hours, and I'm slipping off now. Must........finish.......blog.............. My hair's a lot longer now, or it seems longer now it's all fluffed up. My profile pic was taken yesterday, and now my hair seems twice as long. Strange. I'm trying to grow it to my shoulders or longer, but my brother, who I was racing with, gave up and had it cut. Loser. Anyway, I'm sleepy. Gonna go in my room and listen to some 'Tones. Night.
