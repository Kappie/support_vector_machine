Nothing mattered then.... only him...  He camed into my life... turned it upside down... Took away my strive... and left it there to drown... Why did he do it... why did he let go.... Didnt he see it... how it pierced my soul....  My heart then, harderthen diamond, colder then ice... Lock in a chain of an endless vice... The door to freedom seemed so near to me.... However i could never reach it you see...  Grace to me by hand, and gave me a smile... Warmed my heart and cleansed my vile... You see my fren, it isnt hard to let go... Cause what you reaped may not be what you have to sow...  Thebitter wind stung my face....  It didnt matter, I didnt give chase... The coarse sharp sand cut at my soles.... It didnt matter, I tookits toll... The icy waves spatat my feet....  It didnt matter, I was freed...  Begone from disaster, that you may know... That I did not have to plunge to save my soul... For neither fire not frost i need to fear, Drenched in light, so you may hear...  I now spin high, with grace and freedom... Taking the leap into the depts.... That humankind may soon once know... That we may no more fear out debts...  Thebitter wind stung my face....  but I was saved by mercy, saved by grace The coarse sharp sand cut at my soles.... but I was warm by love, no more by cold... The icy waves spatat my feet....  but it never mattered, because........ I am freed...
