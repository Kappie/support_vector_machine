Thank you Jon. I bought myself a DUAL LAYER DVD Burner!  My parents awoke and made me eat breakfast at 8:30 and I just gave Alfred my egg sandwich because food is for weaklings like us human beings.  So we went to Munjal's for a while, Chris was leaving house so we made him go to Munjal's too. Teehee! Hmm.... boring there. No internet. OR GAMES! I had to burn Doom 3 for that jew. Haha.  The computer fair was easy to get into, without any trouble this time. So we stayed until about 1300 or 1330. I bought myself a CPU fan (5000 RPM) and that DUAL LAYER DVD BURNER!  I rock like that!  Afterwards, Munjal went home because he had to get ready to get Ã¼ber raped by some rednecks for two weeks. So Alfred, Chris and I went to his "hizzouch." Wow, I turned gay. Just kidding there!  The ride there was oddish, well not really. Just roadish. We had to slow down for a while too, fucking American checkpoints.  When we got to Chris' house, we had pizza. HAHA. And of course, his puppy was cool. I cuddled with it for a while. DOGS ARE COOL! But a reminder, if that turns to hate me, I'm going to kick it. We also went to 7-Eleven and I bought a slurpee.  So yeah, I got home around 1830 or 1900 and just installed my DVD BURNER! Yeah, I'll install my Fan in two weeks so Munjal can get full liability on that shit. Teehee! So Alfred went home around 2000 and I gave instructions for Eric, my sister's boyfriend on modding his XBox.  Yes, the XBox sucks. It didn't even work for a few minutes there.  Well, I must retire now as I have to wake up and download Evolution X into the new 250GB hard drive.... and fix Eric's computer.  Pieces!
