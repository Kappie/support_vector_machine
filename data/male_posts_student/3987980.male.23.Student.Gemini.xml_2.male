It has sucked in you to a false hope, and then it crushes you. I never really realized this until the most important moment of my Calculus class: THE FINAL EXAM!!!!   If I fail, I'm jumping off a building and taking my instructor with me. I know he put stuff on that exam that wasn't covered in class! I don't remember learning how to find the anti-derivative of COS!
