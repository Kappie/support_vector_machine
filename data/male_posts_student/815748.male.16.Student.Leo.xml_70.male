[x] Part 1 -- The Basics [x]  What's your name? ::: Alexander Samuel Dietz I, Sr. Birthplace ::: Newton-Wellesley Hospital Age ::: 15 Age you act ::: Somewhere around 15 Current location ::: My room Eye color ::: Brown Hair color ::: Brown Right, lefty or ambidextrous? ::: Righty.  Monodextrous. Zodiac sign? ::: Leo/Dragon, though Carl Sagan and Bill Nye agree that astrology is a load of horse feathers. Height? ::: 5'4.5" last time I checked, like a long time ago  [x] Part 2 -- Describe... [x]  Your heritage/nationality ::: Jewish and American, but not Jewish-American.  Stupid PC bastards... I mean ignorant publicly obedient illegitimate children... Your hair ::: Curly Your fears ::: Not getting what I want...in that arena... Your perfect room ::: Mine What you practically do in a day ::: What the crap does that mean?  Eat/sleep/watch TV/hang out online/homework.  [x] Part 3 -- What is/are... [x]  Words you overuse ::: "The." Phrases you overuse ::: "Oughn't it to be" Your first thought when you wake up ::: I'm tired, I want to go back to sleep Your greatest accomplishment ::: Bar Mitzvah, though we'll see how this role business turns out...and this other business Something you want to do ::: Her... haha jk.  Try a case.  [x] Part 4 -- This or that [x]  Pepsi or Coke ::: Coca-cola, but not cocaine McDonald's or Burger Kings ::: McDonald's Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera ::: Britney Spears.  Christina Aguilera is like the pony down at the petting zoo; everybody gets a ride.  Not to say that Britney Spears isn't the same way.  Not to say that I care. Chocolate or vanilla ::: Chocolate.  Vanilla is so... plain. Adidas or Nike ::: Merrells.  But if I had to choose, I'd say Adidas, because they're slightly less evil. Black or white ::: White.  Yeah, I know, I'm racist.  Not really, white is just a really simple color plus I have white pride. Bills or Coins ((Think $$$)) ::: Bills.  And a pound of flesh if I don't get repaid. Burgers or hot dogs ::: Hot dogs, but not Armor Hot Dogs.  What kind of kid eats Armor Hot Dogs? Egypt or France ::: I'll suck up to where I'm going in three weeks and say France.  Plus, Egypt is so hot. Rock or rap ::: Rap, but it depends on the song.  [x] Part 5 -- Do you...[x]  Smoke ::: Not one joint.  "But it's medicinal marijuana!  Prescription Pot!  Texas THC!" Cuss ::: Only damn, but not often, especially since there is no damnation in Judaism. Sing well ::: Not really, but I can rap like nobody's business. Sing in the shower ::: Not...applicable... Talk to yourself --a lot-- ::: Not out-loud.  Wait, is thinking the same as talking to yourself silently? Believe in yourself ::: Yes, though I have some doubts.  Go Dietzinator! Like taking these longass surveys? ::: I don't mind, especially when I'm bored and procrastinating from doing my chemistry project. Play an instrument ::: I used to, the piano.  I haven't really lost my touch, but I'd need to practice a song for a while to be able to play it.  I still use it to figure out TV themes, like the other day I was playing one of the themes to "The OC."  Best show ever, by the way. Want to go to college? ::: Yes. Want to get married? ::: Yes. Want to have children? ::: Yes. Think you're a health freak? ::: No, my immune system can handle anything.  I haven't stayed home sick for over a year, and that was involuntary (Kallikatsos thought I had whooping cough when I coughed once).  Get along with your parents ::: As much as any teenager does. Get along with your siblings? ::: Well enough. Think you're popular ::: Well...  [x] Part 6 -- In the past month have you..[x]  Gone out of state ::: Yes, to Vermont. Drank alchohal ::: Ohhh, dip, I try to restrain myself, but this is just too much.  It's "have you DRUNK alcohOl, stupid survey.  Anyway, no. Smoke ::: No ma'am. Get high ::: Survey, seriously, you need to work on your past participles.  "In the past month have you GOTTEN high"  My answer: So high I can touch the sky... but no. Done any drugs ::: Not even Motrin.  Well, I guess caffeine. Eaten an entire box of oreos ::: Oreos aren't really my thing. Been on stage ::: I've performed in front of several of my classrooms.  I have mad rap skillz. Gone skinny dipping ::: Not since the womb. Been dumped ::: Not in the past month... or ever really.  Although, I have been rejected in the past. Dyed your hair ::: No sir. Stolen anything ::: Well, I stole MY calculator from George's room.  [x] Part 7 -- Your friends! =D [x]  Craziest ::: Um... Charlie Mokriski. Loudest ::: All of my friends are pretty much the same volume.  But this smart girl who sits next to me in history is louder than a yodeler with a shofar. Most shy ::: I would say Loren, but he gets some (non-existent) action, so I'd better keep my mouth shut.  John Garabedian. Blondest ::: Yin-yin (Ian). Smartest ::: You're readin' at him... but I guess Matt Woolf. Kindest ::: Ahhh... but she doesn't really count as a friend.  Richie, before he left. Best personality ::: John. Most talented ::: I guess Jonny; he's good at making those graphs and such.  But my friends have so few talents. Best singer ::: None of them sing, so I'll just say Kevin because he watches a lot of BET. Most ghetto ::: Kevin. Drama Queen ((or King XP)) ::: Melody, I think she might say that I'm not her friend, though. Pain in the ass ::: Ian. The one you just want to strangle to death ((Homer Simpson style))::: Ian. Funniest ::: John.  I laughed out loud when he was talking to me the other day, and I rarely do that sincerely. Best person for advice ::: Jason Shen.  Sorry, Loren, but he deserves the title. Trustworthy ::: It USED to be Loren... I'll just say Jason Shen. Druggie ::: Haha, Will, but he's not my friend.  Jing seems a little drugular, but I guess she's just apathetic. Most likely to end up in jail ::: Loren, he has no regard for the law, plus he'd probably take the fall for whoever is his girlfriend when he's old enough to go to a real prison. Person you've known the longest ::: Brian Liu, but we haven't talked except a few times online since he moved to Andover.  [x] Part 8 -- The Last... [x]  Last dream ::: I don't recollect... but a couple days ago I dreamed I was in English and we had to write two paragraphs during class and I ran out of time... and then yesterday or the day before we had to do that same thing in history for real. Last nightmare ::: See above, though I was just a little agitated. Car ride ::: To school yesterday, at 6:20 in the morning for that Tanzania thing... in which nothing happened... Last time you cried ::: Never in my memory. Last movie seen ::: Paycheck, with Jonny, John, and Loren. Last movie rented ::: Uh... I bought ER Season One a while ago... Last book read ::: I'm still reading "Rise to Rebellion."  So slowly. Last word said ::: "Yeah." Last curse word said ::: "Damn." Last time you laugh ::: LaughED.  Yesterday, walking home with Dan Shir again. Last phone call ::: With a telemarketer for one of them Indian things.  She asked if I was Mr. Dietz, and I said yes because technically I was, but then I panicked and hung up. Last CD played ::: "Liberty! The American Revolution." Last song you listened to ::: "Jenny from the Block" from my blog.  Whoa.  "Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got, I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the blog." Last annoyance ::: George, marauding last night. Last IM ::: With Jason Sullivan about Mock Trials. Last weird encounter ::: With her... ask me about it if you want to know. Last person you hugged ::: I don't really hug. Last person you yelled at ::: Loren, to tell Matt Woolf that he signed my contract so that Matt could witness it. Last time you wore a skirt ::: Not...applicable... Last time you've been evil ::: I probably shouldn't have done what I did to that telemarketer.  They are people too. Sarcastic? ::: Probably yesterday, I'm usually sarcastic at school. Last time you fought with your parents ::: I was arguing with my mother on Thursday when we had to get the stuff for the Tanzania thing. Last time you wished upon a star ::: So stupid a thing to do.  Never. Played Truth or Dare ::: I know I have played it in the past, but I can't remember the last time. Spent quality time alone ::: Right now.  [x] Part 9 -- I swear this is the last one! -- Randomness [x]  Are you talking to someone on AIM ::: Not at the moment, no. Do you feel lonely ::: Not per se. Ever TP'd someone's house ::: No. How about egging someone's house ::: Nope. Do you not like dislike not like me? ::: Yes, I dislike you. Ain't Eminem and 50 Cent just fine? ::: I don't mind them. Yo Momma ::: Yo What? Ever been so hungry you felt like you could eat the person next to you? ::: No, the last cannibalistic thought I had was wanting to eat Jar Jar Binks during Episode I.  He looked like he tasted like chicken.  Oh wait, he wasn't human. What do you think of George Bush? ::: He's an alright person I guess, but not a great president. Any secret fetishes? ::: No. Do you like to wear chains? O_o ::: I'm Jewish. How many languages do you speak? ::: Two alrightly.  And I can understand biblical Hebrew somewhat. Damn.. are your fingers tired? Cause mine sure are! ::: Yeah. Glad this is over? ((Say yes and I'll stalk you XP)) ::: Relieved, I guess.  Congratulations if you've read this far.  I'll update when something new happens.
