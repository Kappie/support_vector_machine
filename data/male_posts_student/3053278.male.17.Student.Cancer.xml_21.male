I looked at the past couple weeks and like my finals I didn't prepare very well, but then again I started preparing for finals about two weeks ago and I've been preparing for this tournament for months now. I hope Hammond is there...Win or lose I have to show myself something..Fill that emptiness. I feel like I've worked harder than every guy on that team, but never really got the payoff. I once said to Marcus, "Your a perfectionist whether or not you want to admit it." He Responded, "And you just want to be the best there is whether or not you want to admit it." I need to fill that hole in me...Whether it's fencing or something else... I have to find it, I have to find my plug.
