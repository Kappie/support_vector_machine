As my family drove to a college visit at Goucher college (was cool) we saw signs that said  REPORT SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY CALL: (tips hotline I don't remember #)   my dad gave me his cell phone and said "let's call" I still kinda want to but prolly only at a pay phone. and a remote one at that...with gloves on....and a tinfoil cap. seriously this sounds like something a totalitarian goverment would support. things need to change...anybody but Bush 2004
