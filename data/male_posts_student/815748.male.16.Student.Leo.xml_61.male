Whatever, at least it schools Jason's "Xanga"... whatever the crap that means...  Speaking of Jason and Loren, this funny thing happened in Heidi yesterday... We're doing these art history stuff projects, and Loren's group had a poster with a naked chick on it, and I was like "Oooo, Loren," and he was like "What are you talking about?" and I pointed and he was like "Oh, yeah..." and Jason was like "Yeah, Loren helped with the gluing on that one..."  Loren and I were both kind of shocked, but I thought it was funny.  (If you don't get it, here's a hint: he would have been alone...)  Also speaking of Loren, his second-to-latest post is equally entertaining and personally grrring. Aside from the blatant spelling/grammatical errors (like "Which of You're Friends"), he was saying stuff like he lived on two continents (New Hampshire isn't a continent, Loren) and that he was in love with Melody (such a middle-school thing) and that I was least likely to get married (I don't see you getting any further than like less than hand-holding). Why I oughta...  Mock Trials party at my house yesterday, went comme ci comme ca, I presented a direct of Palmer (good, but people didn't like Steph Kaplan's lawyering and I kind of messed up on cross), a rabbi showed up asking for money, and then Elliott ruined my whole realpolitik plan to get a role. Ask me about this if you want to know my plan; whadayagannado.  Ummm, Thanksgiving was OK I guess, I was thankful for a lot of new TV (not on today, though!), kind of boring, and I have nothing but work to do over the too-short break.   And I don't know what I'm going to do with my strategy...
