When we reached there,it was unexpectedly still quite full of people even for a weekday.The sun was shining brightly and so it was a good time to go for a dip.The water felt so relaxing...wish all those who are reading this right now was there with me enjoying the water :) we tried all the different pools and the jacuzzi pool was therapeutic indeed...soothed my aching back.  We stopped by around 6.30pm and we took the MRT from Chinese Gardens to Kallang,cos we were going to Geylang to eat eat.IN the end we ordered Chilli Frog Legs,Sambal Kangkong,Kailan,Butter Crayfsh and Fried Beehoon Singapore Style. Somemore imagine the Fried beehoon i wanted onli 4 dollars one,in the end the waiter tot the 3 of us eating and gave us the 8 dollars one.Wahhh cos the beehoon i ate alone,i was struggling to finish it.  :) After the satisfying meal...we just walked along the lorongs and went to Rochor Beancurd to eat a nice bowl of chilled beancurd.It was indeed very enjoyable haha and lucky i din get sunburn at all or else i sure feel pain all over.  Signing out and chowzzz  Joshy
