The more turns you have, the more attacks you can place. Also, there's weapons and defense systems, and also spies who you can send to see other player's attack power, defense power, and gold, in case you wanna beat them and loot their piggy banks. It makes me excited when I leave the computer thinking "After I come back in two seconds I'm gonna be rich. However, when I turn around and sit down after taking two steps away, nothing happens... *cough* Right, so it's annoying having to wait a day for sufficient funds to come through.  I went to a worship team rehearsal for my youth group last night, and it was fun. I sang, and drummed. Afterwards, I asked my brother how I did drumming and he responded with "Oh, you were drumming?" which means that my drumming was very unnoticable from the other drummers there. That's a good thing. It was fun, anyway. Recently,  urlLink Gaia online  an anime roleplaying community, has caught my attention also. Basically it's a HUGE forum community where everything you post and look at gives you gold. You use gold to buy outfits for your avatar, a little charactar that appears on your posts. There's general conversation, technical help and other things of the such, roleplaying forums, and so on. It's pretty fun. Although it takes a lot of posting to get some good clothes... Peace.
