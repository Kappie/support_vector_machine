I realised that being with a person is easy but living with a person, breathing and eating in the same house requires lotsa efforts. How much are u willing to accomodate to the other person and how much are u able to tolerate one another's personal habits. I guess everything takes time. I'm not sure if i am able to take it but no matter what i can be sure that i'll be trying my best.    Todae we almost 'killed' each other. i almost wanted to throw in the towel and give it all up. But i did not. My level of tolerance is amazing. Sometimes i wonder if that's the best option i am taking. a choice is a choice.
