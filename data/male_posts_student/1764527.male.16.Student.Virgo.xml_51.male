But, the one thing that people may not realize is that I may not be telling the truth. So, before you get all huffy-puffy and get your panties all in a wad, just think, "Is George telling the truth?" 
 I'll tell you this much though, if it's the truth, I usually tell the truth but you must  always  take anything you hear with a grain of salt. That's my piece of wisdom for today. You should take that wisdom with a grain of salt, too. LOL I crack my self up...
