Anyway, tomorrow night and Saturday morning I'm working on the boat, then I'm heading off for three straight nights with Pure Energy... Saturday night at Gillette Stadium and Sunday and Monday... IIII dunno.  I guess I'll find out soon.  Then Tue AM on the boat, then Wed-Sat nights, and the Sat night cruise on the 21st is NOT one of the mutant 830-midnight cruises... it's 7-1030, so I can actually catch the T home.  How nice. :)  Still crossing my fingers about the Inaugural Ball, but my wonderful friend Jess has said she'd accompany me should the person mentioned in the previous blog be unable to come with.  Either way it's gonna be a great time.  Jess will, without a doubt, be a fantastic date.  Those friends of mine who spent this semester in London are home now.  So Bobbie, Steph, Court- call me, yo, so we can party in Beans.  My roommate Dawn and I talked for a little over 2 hours tonight, which is the longest time we've talked by a factor of 10, I think.  It was a great talk.  She invited me to come to her holiday party at the State house next Wed.  I'm working, but I'll see how this weekend goes, money-wise, and see if I can't afford to skip one cruise worth of pay to party with Jane and company.  Dawn, by the way, is a sweetheart.  Incredible sweetheart.  Both of my roommates are.  They're just great.  I hate crises, especially because I am one who is so NOT prone to panic over ANYTHING, and now it's becoming apparent that the ICCA is something that deserves to be panicked over.  Two host groups backed out of hosting the same show, and another group backed out of hosting another show, so unless in the next couple of days, two groups step up to host those shows, I have to cut 18 friggin' groups out of the competition.  Not fun.  Not fun at all.  Hence my away message tonight.  Why am I up right now?  gah.  Errands tomorrow, plus the ICCA crisis to deal with, and all of that needs to be done in the morning and afternoon because I'm working at night.  And I have to call Johnny.  DO NOT let me forget to call Johnny.  I don't care who you are or whether you know me.  IM me, call me, email me... DO NOT let me forget to call Johnny.  In related news, I spent part of today trying to figure out whether I want a Navi or an Escalade.  Any thoughts?  This is, of course, contingent on how frequently I work for Johnny... but I'm allowed to dream.  Especially when this position pays so bloody much.  *calculates how many round trip plane/train tickets to Philly he could buy with a single night's pay* *smiles*  Life is good.  And oh yeah- I got my acceptance to Berklee on Tuesday, for those who I haven't told.  So life really is very good.  Alright.  Bed.  After about 10 more pages of  The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt , that is.  Talk to you all soon.  DO NOT let me forget to call Johnny.
