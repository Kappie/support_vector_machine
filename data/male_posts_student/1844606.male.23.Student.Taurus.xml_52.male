I like the look, even thought I frighteninly resemble Travis...I'm thinking about going into Rentertainment and asking if they have Taxi Driver just to see what they do.  I also plan on:  -wearing very "cute" clothing to offset the fact I have a mohawk -having a really fun time during halloween -going bald and then getting to play billy corgan  post script-I still hate southern illinois and if I were to become gov. I would make chicago and suburbs streatching out to Rockford cede from the rest of the state.
