       
      I had a really relaxing weekend. Went to the movies with N--, spent a leisurely afternoon at the library, and celebrated my friend J--'s 40 birthday. Even a drastically low church attendance due to the shift to daylight savings time, a snow storm, and sickness couldn't get me down.  The best part of the weekend came when I picked up some Texas Hots at Johnny's Lunch, sat on my couch in my undershorts and watched  urlLink The Three Stooges  on TV. The thought crossed my mind that this is probably what my guidance counselor thought I would turn out like.
