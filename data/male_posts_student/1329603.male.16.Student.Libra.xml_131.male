    
       Welcome to Friday, which basically counts as the last day of half term... ah, feck it >_  I need a break of some kind... this week hasn't been entirely a very good break, what with Les Mis, a trombone lesson, Ikea... today I've got to do my papers... tomorrow I've got to go and be beaten at pool... I was going to see Laura today but she wanted to move it to tomorrow and I can't do tomorrow. The word I'm looking for is 'bugger'.  It is totally not fair that some people are allowed to be incredibly cool whereas I have to be sehr dull... before you hammer me with things about how it is fair that statement was not without a touch of comedy, it's not entirely serious. But still, you get what I mean. Marx, Ging, Dan... people who get swarmed around, it's not that they're not all lovely people (cause they all rule) but once in a while it'd be nice for someone to be impressed once in a while, you know? Argh, I'm bitching and being really daft. Shush, Jon. Still love you all.  I don't know, so far I haven't really clicked with Ging. To be honest, I think that he like almost everyone else on the planet finds me very irritating indeed, but I don't know. Meh, he seems cool enough.  Roll on Sunday (Les Mis).  Quote of the day: "God on high, Hear my prayer, In my need, You have always been there. He is young, He's afraid, Bring him rest heaven blessed."  From   Bring him home   from   Les Mis   Love, Jon Roskilly
