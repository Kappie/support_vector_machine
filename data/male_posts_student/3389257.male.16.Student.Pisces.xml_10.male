You wanted an ode (however I don't know how to write an ode and so shall stick with a chunky paragraph or two.): Simon is rather cool. his wit is only exceeded by his skill with musical instruments such as guitar. He is without a doubt one of the funniest men alive and one of my bestest friends. He likes sumbreros. He likes sex with non gender specifified oranges.   When I go to Durham, he will be my legacy to bradford. he shall also stalk me in Durham. its a two position post really. He likes urinating in public places. He likes watching people urinating even more so. he doesnt like being kicked. handle with care.   He is good with english. He can even write monkey backwards. I will show you when I have a photo. His only downside is the tremendous amount of crabs. ahahaha. not really. he is rather genitally clean. I say crabs to often. I will try to stop. but this isn't about me. this is about simon. he says "Ben, I like to see you hurt" too much though.   I will always remember Simon for his massive burn on Ms Schhon in IT upon which she turned rather red. Thankyou for making life that bit better simon. You shall be missed early. better stalk me. get the site up and running. I will send you more drawings in the mail.                        Goodbye
