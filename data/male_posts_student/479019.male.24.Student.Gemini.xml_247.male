I mean these classes are more or less like my history seminars which I took last year. The reading is comparable to that. I just have to write a bit more. I also have more time with this being a semester system and I'm not working right now.  Heat and humidty sucks ass. What the hell is this a freaking rain forest? Rain, trees, heat and humidity. Maybe I should have gone to South America for school?  **
