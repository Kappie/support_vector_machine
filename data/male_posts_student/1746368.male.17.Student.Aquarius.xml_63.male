I had to install a bunch of things on a computer in the office. Then I had to fix the Vice Principal's computer because she lost a function on it. That took up the whole class, just those two alone. I need to get a bit more efficent.  In web-page design the teacher told us to make a web-page using Visual Page (the cheating editor) and mostly everyone is done. I am almost done with it, but I am doing it all by hand. I also got to mess around with the digital camera. I decided to take a picture of the clock over the door. I used that for the background on my future goals page.  Lunch; I stayed a little while after web design to scan a picture. It didn't turn out very well. Than I showed just about everyone in the computer lab my stick figure animation (I think it is to the right, if you want to see it). I then went to my old english teacher to visit, and got recruited to help with her computer.  U.S. History=Nap time  Home; worked on my webpage again and here I am.  Well, that's all for now. Um...yea...er...yea, I'm done, just making sure.
