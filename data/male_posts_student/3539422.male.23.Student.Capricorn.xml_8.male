In particular, we could focus on his thoughts regarding man and woman and their relationship to one another, otherwise known as the theology of the body.  I’m hardly an expert on the theology of the body, but I am at least a little bit aware of its potential impact on the world. I believe it was George Weigel who said that the theology of the body is a “theological time bomb”.  It is widely believed within Catholic circles that at some point down the road, not too far away, this rich collection of reflections on the meaning of human sexuality will be embraced by a culture desperate for meaning.  There are still a surprising number of people who are unaware of the Pope’s contribution to the understanding of human sexuality and marriage.  Fortunately, individuals like Christopher West have begun “unpacking” this complex yet monumental vision. He has a great website with salient, thought provoking articles perfect for those interested in exploring the Holy Father’s vision in-depth. www.christopherwest.com  In a beautiful way, the Holy Father ties together the marital act of a husband and wife to the mystery of Christ’s relationship to the Church.  By discovering the connection between marriage and Christ’s betrothal to his Church, the meaning of our entire life is illuminated and enriched.  The “gift” of husband to wife is physically embodied within the sex act.  In giving oneself completely to the other, each finds total fulfillment.  The union is so perfect that it is life giving.  Man and women become co-creators with the Almighty in the creation of new life.  The union of bodies within the marital act is meant to parallel Christ’s eternal union to the Church.  The life giving union of marriage is also a reflection of the most perfect union found within the Blessed Trinity, the Holy Spirit proceeding from the reciprocal love between the Father and the Son.  The beauty of the theology of the body is in its “incarnational” character.  The Divine life of God is brought down to earth in Jesus Christ.  In the Person of Christ, God and humanity are intimately and eternally united.  Thus the most intimate and beautiful of human acts, the gift of self between husband and wife, can be directly linked to the mystery of God.  Time will tell what impact the theology of the body will have on our culture.  More likely than not, after the so-called sexual revolution of the 1960s, men and women will be hungry for an understanding of sexuality worthy of their dignity as created in the image of God.  As the Church has predicted, sex outside the framework of marital love or perverted via contraceptives will only lead to self-alienation and conflict between the sexes.  On the contrary, sex understood as a self-giving and unrestricted act leads to self-fulfillment and a deepening of love between husband and wife.    urlLink    The Creation  urlLink
