Well it was the last  official  day. According to my shirt I'm God and I have enough 'good luck's to repel a lot of those cursing chain mails.  So I have spent over 12 years of my life in education now, taken from society and not given anything back. A pleasing thought that. Last night I found myself watching Question Time from St Andrews featuring some 20 something who I announce to be very irritating. On the issue of  urlLink a 14 year old becoming pregnant and having an abortion without the mother's knowledge  she said that it showed that the government's health and education departments have failed. Now I am not a great supporter of the current British government isn't this a little extreme? It's like saying that because one crime occurred, the police have failed. This same woman had this annoying habit of calling 'here here' to anything anti-government - I dare say that if it was announced that Tony Blair 'smells' she would have called 'here here' to that as well.  On a more personal note I finally asked someone to the prom and she said yes. Now I need to find my self a tux and everything else that goes with it... She's worth it though!
