Good - gliding on graphite on snow. Can't wait to ride.  Today at work kind of sucked. Picked up the Santa Clause and watched it when I got home. I like that movie. It's got charm. It's got Judge Reinhold.t.d.t. I also bought Spiderman. For a dollar. That was cool. Got a slip of paper a few days ago, which, when scanned today, reduced the price of the flick by roughly 23.99. One dolla is a great price for any movie. Plus I got a free Tshirt - another Adult Large - for some reason they're like parachutes on me - Neck almost fits round my shoulders.  Money at work sucked today. I had to approach a quote weilding father and son (my least favorite customer type following the smelly single middle aged balding man-looking-for-a-fight. The father inevitably speaks bad english (Filippo's was pretty bad) the son is cocky and thinks' he knows everything (he didn't) and they want credit (which they usually don't get, but god was in a giving mood today, so Filippo got Six Fucking Thousand Dollars. God wasn't in such a good mood to spare me their request for a discount every five seconds.  So I got home and made some bagel bites. Watched the SC. Garnered a headache beyond all human reasoning. I shouldn't have gone back to work, I'm still not better. Just took some advil and typed this.  I think I'm being stupid when I think that someone's not going to talk to me again, but I get a sinking feeling I'm right :(
