It was tall, about 6', had long black hair, wore womens clothing and womens clothing accessories, but had the face, voice, muscle definition, knees, shoulders, and adams apple of a man... It wore makeup though... We were never sure if it was a transvestite, a transexual, or just a really, really unlucky woman. It was the kindof gal a trucker would give a mayonaise jar to open, the kind of guy you'd go shopping for pumps with... Totally indescribable, but so peculiar... I hope it comes in again...
