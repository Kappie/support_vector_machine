Despite the fact that you're always keeping track of a zillion different things, trying to make sure that nothing is forgotten: no speaker left unthanked, no Late Night left unplanned, no committee meeting skipped. Shad is fun. Plain and simple. Sure, it's not fun in the same way that going out to a party with a group of friends is. It's not fun in the same way that Christmas morning is. But it  is  fun. Make no mistake about that.  I think it's because of the people. You spend everyday with the same group of people. Every minute from when announcements start at 8:30 till Late Night finishes at 10:50 is spent with the same group of people. Naturally, you get to be pretty close pretty quick. I have my own little clique of friends that I hang out with, but I like to think that I can talk/chill/hang with anyone here. I'm just that charming, you see.  I think now would be a good time to tell you about my "clique" (although Shad emphasizes interacting with EVERYONE, we all know that that just isn't feasible and that it's better to make strong ties with a small group of friends than superficial ties with a larger one). Quite simply put, we're the "cool group." That's at least the way it seems here. I think that in a more normal setting, we'd just be the kids with the best social skills. But here... well, you know what they say about the one-eyed man in the land of the blind.  We're normal kids. We enjoy partying, having a good time with our friends, and just generally being teenagers. We're the ones who think that the penis game is funny. We think that various euphemisms for "penis" are funny. We build giant cocks in the sand. We're kids. There's Rosie, Angus, Rory, Stephanie, Ashok, Dan, John, Lisette, Luna, Melissa, and Sheila.  Rosie's from H-town (Hamilton, for those of you not in the know), and she's pretty cool. Good taste in music. Angus is from some rural place in Cape Breton, and has the craziest accent you could ever imagine. He's a DJ, and pretty funny. Rory is the guy that I have the most inside jokes with. He does a lot of acting (well, auditions), and hails from rural New Brunswick (somewhere near Moncton). Stephanie is from Charlottetown. Rory and I have a lot of potato jokes about her (put the potato in the oven and what comes out nine months later? Tater tots! Skin the potato... with your TEETH!). Ashok is a pretty cool dude from Long Island, NY. He originally lived in Mississauga, so he understands my O-town blues. Dan's from Hamilton too. Heavy on the football. Good guy. John's a pretty funny dude from the T-dot. Plays a pretty mean set of bagpipes too. Lisette is awesome. She's a blonde bombshell from Cape Breton. Those Nova Scotians have the damn hottest accents ever. Luna's from New Market. Craziest girl I know. Melissa's a very sweet girl from Calgary. Sometimes kinda blonde, but a definite sweetheart. Sheila's pretty awesome too. She's from Dryden, a small town in Northern Ontario. She's diabetic, but has a really positive outlook on life. I love her to bits. Ah, who am I kidding... I love 'em all to bits.  There are other people I'm friends with too, but those are the ones that I spend most of my free time with.  I'll tell you all about Green House... but not till tomorrow. I've got a super-important meeting to get to now.  Lotsa love to the O-tizzle from the O-dot, - Cary
