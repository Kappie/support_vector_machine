I've always said I'd never teach, because both my parents are teachers, and seeing and hearing about what they went through, really put me off. Even though over the years many people have told me I should teach, it just wasn't something I felt I wanted to do.  Over the years I have felt little nudges from God, as if to say, "this is what want you to be doing with your life". This came in the form of friends, and people at church, telling me I should be teaching, and just a feeling, like you get when you know something is right. Even though I felt God's 'nudge', I was happy with what I was doing, and I resisted.  Early last year I started a new job, as a Checkout Manager, a step up from what I had been doing, and a new challenge, which I felt ready for. After prayer, and careful consideration, it seemed to be the right move to make, so I went. The job was a challenge, and one I found I was not enjoying. The hours were long, the task hard, and I began to doubt if I was up to it. Eventually I decided this wasn't the place for me. Again a little voice seemed to be saying to me "Teach. That is the gift I gave you, use it".  I thought about it, and decided to apply. I sent in an application, and said to God, "you want me to teach... Make it happen".  He works fast. I sent my application in two weeks before the start of the second semester, thinking that I would not hear anything until 2004. Not so! The Thursday before the semester was to start, I got a phone call. Someone had pulled out, could I come in for an interview on Friday? I went in, and within an hour of walking onto the college campus, I was enrolled, and due to start on the Monday!  People hearing that story say that I was lucky to get accepted that fast. I know what it was, and luck had nothing to do with it.
