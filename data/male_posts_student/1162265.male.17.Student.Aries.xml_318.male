It was basically about this white guy who married a black woman and was trying to prove how race was meaningless.  The only flaw of the philosophy, is that REAL racist don't believe it.  But whatever.  What's even worse is unconscious racism.  Like today, "I was driving through Irvington, that's like the Ghetto.  It wasn't too much of a problem though, I kept my windows rolled up."  "Yeah it's not a problem as long as your just driving through, and don't stop or anything."  What the hell is that supposed to mean? Why would any right minded student think that backwards.  Oooh snap son, I was driving through the town that borders us, and their are so many niggers there, I really hope none of them decide to harrass and kill me.  *Rolling of eyes*    Next, story time.  I was recollecting camp, as I often do, and remembered this girl I was obsessed with.  I think I was about 13 at the time of this, my first year being a 'senior' at camp.  Our sister cabin, we got along with decently, but I hung out with three girls.  One of them was Christina, who I was friends with my last three years of camp (I only went 4), one of her friends who's name I can't rember, and Felipa (I spelled that wrong) Hernandaz.  I became completely hung up with Felipa.  She was same age (I think) maybe 12 at the time, didn't really matter. Oh, and she was Mexican! She wasn't seriously hot, I mean she was 12 at the time (I was 13, I wasn't a pervert!), but that's beyond the point.  I was obsessed with her, and somehow didn't tell her this the entire time while I was at camp despite the fact info travels fast among 200 or so people.  So I told one of her friends, hoping the rumor would spread to her.  Silence a few days.... Then one day I was going to Wikappeck (a cabin with appliances!) to get my laundry, and Filly (her nickname) was there.  Someone, I forget who, said something like "Do you like Marcus?" when I was around and she said "No,  ."  The thing is I forget what she said after no, but I just recall, oddly, not being crushed.  Strange.  She never came back to camp.  That's fairly odd, but stranger is that was over 4 years ago.  Oooh actually, come to think of it that was also the first year I met Sonya and Samone, but details.  I just find it strange that has been on my mind all day, and that I've never talked about that.  Enough rambling.
