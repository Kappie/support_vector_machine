Lovely isn't it when you have a day and don't know what to do?     I don't know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve. J. R. R. Tolkien (1892 - 1973), The Fellowship of the Ring    Posted: May 14,2004 12:07 PM     I'm still bored an no one's really been on today. Ate a sandwich for lunch. Wow! never had figured I'd be at a loss for words.  Posted: May 14,2004 4:22 PM     I've changed the layout to a blue. Comment if you don't like it. I surveyed the 2 people who were online today and they said the blue. That being said..... Goobye, see ya later. Again.  Posted: May 14,2004 8:50 PM
