Let’s get to it shall we?  Colin  Christie – With a display of great wit this leg, they have gained a 13 hour lead over the other teams. They, however, seem to lose it next leg as Charla  Mirna steal their cab. They really deserve for their cab to be stolen, after all that bickering this leg. Going to travel agencies seems to be what Colin does best, but always remember, when there’s a flight that’s going to go soon, and you cannot afford to waste time, it’s not always the best option. Colin has a really bad attitude, and instead of Christie bringing down the team, Colin will succumb easily under pressure. I thik they have what it takes to go far, most probably to the final 3 teams.  Charla  Mirna – I can’t make any excuses for their neglecting to check with the trusty travel agencies. Like I said before, the safer option is the airport. Their not being able to find a taxi was stupid, even though they did save a bit of cash there. Finding the 50 min earlier flight out was one of the best tactical maneuvers I’ve seen on this season so far. I kind of think if Colin  Christie had gotten the same tickets as everybody, they wouldn’t have performed as well as these 2, because they would’ve succumbed to “peer pressure” and went with the others to eat, drink and be merry. Mirna better start doing something for the team, cause now it isn’t exactly balanced. With 2 people o the team with an equal number of plus and minus points, balance is very important.  Brandon  Nicole – Funny how the expected Final 3 teams come in 1,2 and 3 this leg. Of all the spoiled final 3 teams, I think this one is the worst as they succumbed to “peer pressure” to fellowship with the other teams instead of trying to find better options. Getting Chip to help, was it a show of manipulative powers? I don’t know. Not much shown on this leg about them really…  Chip  Kim – Where was Kim? I don’t even recall her speaking in a confessional this time around. Chip seems to be the brains and brawn of this team, and Kim is just there to fulfill the ‘team’ requirement to get into the race. I kind of think that they need to start bickering a little bit to make more of an impact on the show. Chip surely went up in my ratings this week. Although helping people is not so much a good tactical maneuver, I’ve said it before that I’d rather someone play Mr. Nice Guy than good player. He better not help anyone if they get any further, cause he may just ‘help’ himself out of the race.  Marshall  Lance – All I remember of them was that Marshall’s leg was hurt. I don’t see how he got that injury, unless he was so dumb that he injured himself during the 12 hour break. Oh yeah… He is dumb! I really don’t know why they didn’t ask help from anyone for the Rock  Roll thing, since one of them was injured. They actually showed a little race skill by checking in with the Air France office. Unfortunately, it was closed. When a team is rumored to be eliminated next round, I don’t think it’s exactly viable to support them.  Kami  Karli – They really don’t seem to have any brains. You know that you’re more physical than the bowling moms, and when you don’t know where to go you might as well wait for them and then beat them at the Roadblock. It was risky for them to go walking around like that, without a clue as to where to go. If they weren’t helped out by Chip, I think they would be roaming the desert for 40 years.   Linda  Karen – Domestic airport mistake, again! These people never learn, do they? I’m just wondering how they’ll cope next week, because this week was all that was shown of them was mistake after accident, and mistake after accident. Again, the blonde one didn’t do anything, and what’s worse, now she has an excuse to let the other one do all the work. I was hoping they didn’t catch up to the 3.15pm flight to Cairo, because they really didn’t deserve to. Getting their money stripped of them was entirely deserving, but what would’ve been better is that they got eliminated.
