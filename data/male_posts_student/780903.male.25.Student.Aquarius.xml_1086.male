Look under my bed if any are missing.  Shake hard drive.  Check garbage pail.  Ask friends for copies of theirs.  Try not to lose them too. Day 2: Get some outlines off the Internet.  Feel productive while downloading lots of stuff I'm never going to read. Day 3: Sneak into journals office late at night and print outlines for free.  Never tell anyone I do this.  Oops. Day 4: Go to bookstore.  Look at study guides.  Memorize without buying.  Go back five minutes later, ashamed of myself, and buy study guides.  Feel bad for the rest of the day. Day 5: Pick a treatise, get it from the library, and pretend to read it cover to cover. Day 6: Print out every practice exam I can find and will never actually do.  Feel productive while stapling them. Day 7: Condense notes into an outline.  Get tired on page 3.  Use outline I downloaded instead.  Feel productive while going through downloaded outline line by line correcting typos. Day 8: Catch up on reading for semester. Day 9: Look for notes I lost since Day 1 when I had them all neatly in a pile. Day 10: Go to professor's office hours hoping to extract clue about exam questions.  Fail miserably, but feel productive for having tried. Day 11: Restaple stuff. Day 12: Read another treatise. Day 13: Do a practice exam.  Convince myself that if I had a model answer to look at, mine would be just as good. Day 14: Try the outline thing again.  This time get to page 8.  Decide you really want to have a small outline.  50 words or less.  Feel productive for making a completely useless 50-word outline. Day 15: Pretend I don't have an exam in less than two weeks.  Read US Weekly, TV Guide, or something else really vapid. Day 16: Wake up refreshed after a day off.  Realize how good that felt.  Take another day off. Day 17: Two practice exams.  Compare answers with the dumbest friend I can find.  Feel satisfied I'm not as dumb as he is. Day 18: Make some new outlines.  Fail miserably. Day 19: Read the outlines I downloaded, and the commercial study guides I shamefully purchased.  Convince myself I know this stuff. Day 20: Re-read the outlines.  Realize nothing stuck.  Bang head against wall. Day 21: E-mail friends at other law schools for their outlines, just for the heck of it.  Print them out and immediately throw them away. Day 22: Practice exam and interminable session with smart friends where we go over answers.  Feel satisfied I'll have a happier life than they will. Day 23: Lots of sleep.  For no particular reason. Day 24: Catch up on American Idol recaps on the Internet. Day 25: Final attempt to make useful outline.  Sort of helps.  Feel productive. Day 26: Last practice exam. Day 27: Lots of Vitamin C. Day 28: Take exam.  Cry myself to sleep.
