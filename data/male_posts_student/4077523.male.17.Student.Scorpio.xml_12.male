We did almost all if not all of the rides there and some twice. Jessica wouldn't go on any of the 3 speed slides, but Ashley at least went on the one on the right, the Freefall. On the way home Justin was a bit tired so I drove his truck back, and his truck is a good bit different than mine on the gas and brakes, lol. My feet are sore from today, all that walking, and i'm tired, haha. Well, that is about it just because i'm worn out. -Fly with Christ
