       
       I'm sorry I had to touch you. You seemed so calm and serene lying on the cold hard concrete of the driveway. My mother doesn't like you, though. She says you're dirty and you have to be put away where no one else can see you. I know you're dead, but when I look at you it's like when I looked at my great-grandmother's face after she passed away. From time to time the wind will pick you up and I'll get mad because I had fit you into a nice, compact pile of conformity and homogeneity. Then I have to sweep you all over again, my back muscles straining under the pressure of having my tall frame stoop to your level. You play with me, and I know you do, but that's okay. There are so few to play with these days. Playing is for "kids," They say, but what do They know? Sometimes it's fun to play, even with you and the wind. But next time, please don't blow in my face. I have allergies.
