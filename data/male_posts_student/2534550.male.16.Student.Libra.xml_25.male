When we got in the room with the drumline though, I understood because it was so cool being apart of that, I mean at Vintage we werent even that good at the end of our season. Then we played and it was like "WOW" and thats all I could say.   Marching was also pretty cool because, well I dont know why but it was...haha Anyways The baritones heavy but eventually it was so painful that it was painful anymore and when that happened I felt very accomplished, very accomplished indeed.  So yea guess Ill see ya all next week. Till then.....
