English: Start! In Japanese: HAJIME!  Hinotama yawned and stretched lazily under a fine shady tree. The sounds of the river near by added peace to the serene afternoon as birds sang merrily. The tempurature was fairly humid, as it had just rained the day before, so she chose to laze around as Haruka slaved in the river, trying to catch fish. Hinotama stared at the flowing, long grass, then slowly broke one from the earth, placing it in her mouth to chew. She then lay her hands on her belly, holding her fan, too comfortable to even cool herself down. Haruka, sweating, wet, tired, hot, and rather uncomfortable, wiped her brow and peered about the surrounding forest. Ever since they had left the village of Seishuu, she had been wary that they would not be followed. About a week had passed, but she still felt the need to be sure. After a quick scan, she looked over to where Hinotama lay, making sure their belongings were near by. A set of samurai swords lay against the tree, and two special blades that were constructed especially for assassination. Much shorter then the usual katana, and with a much longer handle. Not far were sheaths that a common samurai would carry, and a two sacks that held extra clothes and food. Haruka kept all her daggers on under her clothes, Hinotama usually did the same, but with just one or two.   I'll use anything I can find , Hinotama had said long ago with a shrug.  Haruka frowned as she watched Hinotama. Such a careless creature, that she was unfortunately cursed with looking after. "You lazy ass," Haruka called from the river, very sure there was no one within hearing distance, "you're supposed to be cleaning the blades!" Hinotama opened one eye and peeked at Haruka. "What for?" she responded lazily, "We haven't used them since the  last  time you asked me to clean them."   Haruka rolled her eyes and breathed in calmly. She squished the mudd with her toes and immediatly felt the fish flutter around her legs. Aquiring a concentration only a few could ever master, Haruka's breathing slowed down rappidly, and her eyes followed the exact movements of the fish. Suddenly her heart raced, beating to the exact movements of a particular one. Hinotama watched as calmly, and stealthy, Haruka snatched the creature from the water with her bare hands and with such grace, that it resembled that of a heron. There had been hardly any splash, or any noise to tell what she had just done.  "Now catch nine more!" Hinotama shouted with a laugh, "I'm that hungry." Haruka threw the fish at Hinotama. "You wish, pig!"  Hinotama got a direct hit from the fish in the face. She stared at Haruka with wide eyes and a dropped open mouth, the fish slapping around in her lap.  Haruka looked off and tried to hold off her laughter. "How dare you!" Hinotama cried with a hint of humour, "I do hope you know that you eat much more then I do!" Haruka just continued to laugh, beginning to scout out more fish. Hinotama, pouting, flung all the items in her lap to the groud (including the still flopping fish), wiped her face that now stunk of fish, and quickly took off her socks. Getting up in a rush, she quickly rushed into the river and froze in front of Haruka with a grin. Haruka glared at Hinotama. "You wouldn't," she said stepped back. Hinotama stepped forward. "I could!" Haruka smiled and cocked an eye brow. "You think you can catch  me ?"    The three little boys....(argh gotta go. ill continue later)  The two girls lay on smooth grass, staring up into the sky. After soaking one another in the river, it was time to dry off under the warm Sun. Two fish were cooking over a small fire on one of the rocks near the water's edge. One of the fish had been caught by fluke as Hinotama had grabbed one from the river, throwing it at Haruka, but missing to have it flung under the tree where the first fish had been thrown.   *dis is not the ending, im gonna right more, i just wanted to show jade the funny scene :D l8r!*
