I'm gonna eat lunch....get dressed first, then eat....de ja vu? anyway....it's really weird how I only get depressed at night....I've noticed that. I'm usually okay during the day, but at night, I'm just really bad off. Makes me wonder if I do have a medically treatable problem. Of course, there's no getting help with that anyway. My mom would want to know why I think there's something wrong with me, and then she would proceed to deny that there's anything wrong, that I'm making a big deal out of nothing. Of course, who am I to listen to what she says? she's in a constant state of denial about everything, because she's got her own problems. Which, of course, she won't acknowledge. My counselor doesn't know everything yet, may take him awhile to get the whole picture, you know how counselors are. When he does, not really sure if he'll acknowledge a problem or not, it's really hard for me to communicate everything I'm feeling. He might just blow it off, but I don't know. I gotta go eat, that's one thing I do know.
