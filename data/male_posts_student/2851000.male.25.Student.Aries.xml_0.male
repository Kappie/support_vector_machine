I do hope however that this serves as an introduction to some, and leads others to investigate the subject more fully (to help you in you search I will give a few links at the end of this posting).   What To Do?  Where To Start?   The never ending conflict in the Middle East over Israel has been a simmering caldron that threatens to boil over at any moment.  No one wants to get to close or to involved for fear of being burnt.  What to do about this situation has perplexed world leaders for generations.  Today’s leaders are no different, no one is quite sure what to do.  Most of our national leaders are sure about one thing, and that is that evangelical Christians stand in one accord on this issue.  Namely, that the ethnic nation of Israel was given an eternal right to that land by God, and that they currently have sole rights to all of that land through divine right.  The problem is that evangelicals are not of one accord on this issue.  I am one who stands against that presumption.   Why do I stand against that presumption?    I stand against that presumption because I believe that when you look deep into the Bible you will see that God did make an everlasting covenant with Abraham, and one of the promises in that covenant was the everlasting possession of the promised land (Genesis 17:7-8).  But the keepers of the covenant where the ones who did and still do keep it by faith, or in other words not Abraham’s physical descendants but his spiritual ones.  Paul talks about this in many places throughout his letters, two examples can be found in Ephesians 2:11-13, and Romans 9-11.  Reading over these verses shows that the real descendants of Abraham today are the ones that have placed their faith in the finished work of Christ on the cross.  Ethnic Israel has no divine claim on the promised land according to this understanding of the Church.  So have the promises about the promised land become null and void?  No, spiritual Israel (the Church) is still promised the land.  Yes, the land of Israel has been promised to you and I along with the whole commonwealth of Israel.  I must put in a little note here, the promised land is ours, but we will never have possession of it till Christ comes and hands it over to us at his second coming.  So what are the implications of this in regards to current events between Israel and the Palestinians?  Well, I think that as Christians we must support the rights of the Palestinians, including the right to statehood.  We must work towards and promote a fair and just settlement between the two factions, condemning evils perpetrated by both sides.  We should write our leaders and tell them this is what we stand for, and that not all evangelicals stand for the complete rights of Israel to that land.  Above all we should pray.  Pray for peace and that both the hearts of Jews and Muslims would turn and put their faith in the finished work of Christ Jesus.

A few places I recommend for further investigation:    This is a recent sermon by Pastor John Piper on the subject, he does a much more detailed look at these things than I have here-   urlLink Israel, Palestine, and the Middle East  An article by Michael Horton-  urlLink The Church and Israel  An article by the staff at Knox Theological Seminary-  urlLink An Open Letter to Evangelicals and Other Interested Parties: The People of God, the Land of Israel, and the Impartiality of the Gospel
