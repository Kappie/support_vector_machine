I will go insane!  I call back and they always say "uh... were not hiring now, but we have your app on file if we need you..."  and then give me an excuse not to tell them that they are idiots. But then again, why hire a 15 year old who is still in high school then hire a college student who will only be working for the summer! If thats your deal then fine, Wendys, Perkins, Gamestop, EB Games, Wal*Mart, Shopko,  K-Mart, Culvers, and Burger King, be that way!   Im gonna apply for Online learning  I think it is a good idea, a high school letting kids who are adept to computers learn online... maybe I will be posting here even more next year, but on schoo subjects... god that would be cool...
