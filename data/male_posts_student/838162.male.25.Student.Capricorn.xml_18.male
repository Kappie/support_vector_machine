I know that stuff like this are usually overhyped and blown out of proportion. But it is also in cases like this that we should remember our friends, family and loved ones overseas and not take for granted their safety, health and happiness. With our ever shrinking world, it is getting even more and more easiler to contact and stay in touch with one other. Let us make that step to keep the lines open. Peace and Out.
