(he said this with a straight face on the Today show)  FUN FACT: scott  i met michael moore and we got to hold his oscar when he came to UR! it was right after he won it and he said that he was carrying it everywhere with him.   dodgeball: i think most of you saw it already. personally, i LOVED it! so hilarious. not quite as good as zoolander, but similar humor and ridiculously funny characters.  the terminal (aka: one of the most painfully boring  long movies i have seen) enough said...but i will say more: it sucked. the main storyline wasn't that great and tom hanks is played out.   who's excited for spiderman?? (other than jake of course!)   what are the plans this weekend? has anyone talked to tim?
