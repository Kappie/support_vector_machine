Sure, it is a great political move, giving him another soft issue that is dear to the Left, and at relatively low cost.  But I'm really fed up with this crap.  I guess I have to accept that this is the America we live in - hand outs for all, regardless of the ethics of wealth redistribution.  We've come to accept that it is perfectly fine to reach into someone else's pocket to pay for something that few people want.  I'm angry, upset and disgusted, but what good will it do?  I'm shouting into the wind.
