I'm feeling a bit like the girl in Lost in Translation, I'm now living in Hong Kong with my fiance, but she works all day, and I stay in her room studying... But that doesn't last so long, I've been doing a lot of wandering around, eating pocky and some strange, quite unlike cake, "fishcake" substance that, though i've never liked fish, tastes delicious. Actually, I now eat fish, or should i say fishes, like, the whole fish goes on my plate, and i scarf it down. The eyes taste wierd. It's a cool 32 degrees in the shade, so I drink alot of bottled sweat "Pocari Sweat", it tastes like gatorade, but with no flavour. Oh, dinner time! gotta go!   Enjoy, SofaKiD
