Just like my ex said.. only time will tell.   Destiny? Anyone reading this believe in that? I do... Somehow I know that we have all our given destiny...  Will I be able to die in the arms of the person I love? Will I wake up 20 years from now in the arms of that person?...  So many questions that I am dieng to find out...  Pero still have the patients to see what's going to happen next.   Have I finally found the one? I'm not in a hurry. I'm willing to learn another heart ache it that is what it takes for me to be the perfect person for the One.  *sigh* No, I'm not sad. Just that so many thoughts are in my mind and my head is still hung up. I like the way things are right now. Except for the fact with people who are after my ass. Pero most of it I am really happy with. I know I have a friend who I could have and hold forever... Forever...  does that ever exsist. I wonder so many times jud.
