I know there was a big storm because I was up, and couldn't fall back into sleepland because my throat was SO sore that I couldn't even sleep.  What's it been now, like 8 years of this little illness?    So now my feet are freezing because I went to check my mail outside with flip flops on.  I'm sure that will help my cold a great deal.  Wet cold feet.    It's getting interesting around here with things being put into motion about moving.  I always think that being proactive is important in almost any situation.  I am trying to be proactive as well in this moving endeavor.  I spoke to my realtor in Chicago yesterday on the phone, and he's going to be working on getting my search set up for places to live.  This will take a lot of stress out of the process to have someone helping me out on that front.  This way, when I fly out to look at places, I will have appointments set up for me already, and not have to trek around town with the classifieds.  He's even going to be sending me weekly updates with all listings that match my criteria in the areas of town I want to live in.  Afterall, I will not have much time to find a place because I will more than likely be in town for only a weekend when I go to look at apartments and condos.  I was starting to get worried about the daunting task of having only a couple of afternoons worth of time to find a place to reside, but I feel better knowing I've got someone taking some of the stress out of the process for me.  I just got finished watching MTV's "I Want A Famous Face."  That's quite pathetic.  Some of these people don't need a FAMOUS face, per say, but rather a more human-looking face.  I guess shoot for the moon and if you miss at least you're among the stars huh?  Because you, my friend, do NOT look like Kate Winslett, you still look like a fat redhead to me.  Then again, so is Kate Winslett. I don't know how to spell her name and don't care to learn.  It's been a long time since I saw the credits rolling on TITANIC, so don't' be too hard on me.  What have you done for me LATELY Kate?  Oh well, you got some air time today on MTV, because some douche in Florida apparently wanted to look like you.  Oh GOOD, the Osbourne's are on now.  Freakshow.    I think I'll turn it to MadTV instead, because I assume it's about time to throw up all this phlem that's making me sick, and what better way to do it than by inducing hurls with bad television:)  I'm very excited that this coming week is going to be very easy-going.  I have very few responsibilities to take care of for the next week or so, therefore I can be relaxed, get to feeling better, and just handle my shit.    Take care friends, have a good weekend and don't drink and drive!
