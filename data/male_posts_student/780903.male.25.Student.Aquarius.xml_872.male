Oh I can't make you read me If you won't I can't make you focus If your brain don't I may be dry I may be boring If you look at the page You may soon be snoring But try Won't you try Cause I can't make you read me if you won't  Fine, skip the case Then you won't see The law that's applied In the pages of me  Morning will come And you'll go to class The teacher will call on you You'll have to pass Oh you'll have to pass  Oh I can't make you read me If you won't I can't make you focus If your brain don't I may be dry I may be boring If you look at the page You may soon be snoring But try Won't you try Cause I can't make you read me if you won't
