I just enjoy this work of prodding in to the obscurity through a little keyhole. A single ray of light which can be crafted to the needs of what is seen. I do like I get all romantic about this stuff because I guess its my true pasion.  I normally have a hard time explaining this to my girlfriend. But passion and intellect are hard to combine. O how I dread the moment of equilibrium.  Anyhow Sandra is dropping by soon. A few beers are at stake... lets drink and celebrate for the morning will come with its problems that we can not foresee...  State: I am ok.
