They put an IV in my right arm, an oxygen mask over my nose, and the next thing I knew I was lying in the recovery room with some ice packs. I estimate that it took 15 minutes for me to wake up fully from the drug-induced sleep. I didn't ask them for my teeth beforehand, though, so they discarded them; I don't get to keep my teeth. Evidently they came out in pieces, too.    Dr. Anthony Beech, my maxillofacial surgeon, did a pretty good job in my estimation. He even sewed up the holes my wisdom teeth used to be in with some kind of self-dissolving sinew stuff. In general, I haven't experienced any significant discomfort aside from some numbness in my lower jaw yesterday, an aftereffect of one of the drugs used in surgery, and some pain in the back of my mouth where the wisdom teeth used to be.     This relative comfort is at least partly a result of my being all drugged up. They gave me four prescriptions to take and apply after the surgery. Here are the medicines: Vicodin, an oft-abused opiate-based painkiller; Lodine, an anti-inflammatory; Penicillin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic; and a mouth wash, which tastes like Listerine Mint, that I'm supposed to use in lieu of brushing my teeth. I'm not taking the Vicodin because my sister said it made her feel all woozy and half-dead when she took it after getting her teeth removed; instead, I took Advil yesterday and am taking Tylenol today.     I wasn't able to eat much chewable stuff yesterday because I was afraid of chewing myself on accident, though I can pretty much eat anything I want today as long as I'm careful. Mashed potatoes taste pretty good.    It could just be that I got lucky, but getting my wisdom teeth removed wasn't a huge deal. I'm still not going to work tomorrow, though, because Dr. Beech said that I should avoid doing any driving c. for 72 hours after the surgery.     In any case, I thank God for answering my prayers for a no-complication surgery with relative comfort afterwards.
