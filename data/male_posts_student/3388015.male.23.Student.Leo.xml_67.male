We hung out and stopped by Wendy's to get a SPICY chicken sandwhich (no bun, no mayo, no lettuce, in a potato boat) for Cindy.  It came with lettuce, mayo and a potato boat.  We then headed to Jerimiah's, where my friend Katie works in the evenings.  I brought the laptop to get on the net there.  We were seated, but I accidentally confused the waiter guy and we were seated in the wrong section.  But Katie came to us anyway.  I couldn't get on the net, some network error.  I'll try again some other time.  Cindy got really sick, really fast.  I felt bad, so we went and picked up some alcohol and went back to the apartment.  Laura and Luke came over and we hung out until 10 or so.  Luke helped me install some software using his cell phone as a modem.  We walked around and detected wireless networks in the complex.  That was neat.  Cindy and I hung out, played card games, ate good food and eventually got some take out from the Distillery.  Cindy paid, she's so generous.  I ate wings, Cindy ate a pasta dish.  Around 2am, I took Cindy home, and fell asleep.  This morning I dropped by the eye doctor to pick up my contacts.  They didn't have them yet.  Arg.  I then dropped off the cable modem to Time Warner from the old apartment.  They're giving me a new one at the new apartment.  Don't ask why I didn't keep the same one, I'm cheating the company.  Garry asked me to bring my laptop in for the demonstration of the website during the meeting, so I went home at 1 and picked up the laptop and petted the cat.  Apartment smells funky.  Cindy needs to do some dishes.  Heh.  I also brought back a wireless adapted for the PC in my office so I could set up an ad hoc network so I can get wireless on my laptop in the whole building.  UR wireless doesn't come into Lattimore so during my meeting I would normally be screwed.  The meeting went well, Nancy put me in charge of the project, recurring weekly meetings and chose my committee.  Sounds professional.  Anesa and Emily also want to be on a subcommittee.  I suppose I'll find someone to be on a 3rd subsubcomittee. :)  I'm going home early for the Time Warner guy, who is coming any minute to the apartment.
