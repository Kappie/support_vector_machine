He is shown looking at his hands constantly, taking something out of his watch, and not making eye contact with fellow costumers. His early morning trip to the store at 1:30 a.m. (July 19) proofed that he wasn't sleeping at the time he said he was. He is seen in the store with hospital pants and buying lime-flavored cigarettes. Mark and his wife were seen at that same store earlier that night and many believe that that was the last times she was seen alive. Investigators still think Lori was killed in her apartment and is buried somewhere under the 3,000 tons of trash.  This story was written by Jared Drenkow, the info came from Fox News.
