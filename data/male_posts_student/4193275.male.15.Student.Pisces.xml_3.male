I love all Chinese people (especially one), but I want the USA to win this one. Yeah, I'm still obsessed with it - I really should find something better to do, but it's just too much effort.  I think I'm becoming slowly forced out of my own family - today they went out without even asking me if I wanted to go! OK, I always say no, and I would have said no today, but it's still nice to be asked. Right now I wish they'd leave me alone though, because my brother wants me to play penalty shoot outs with him (even though he cries and runs away if I score), and my dad is constantly kicking me off the computer and interrupting the tennis (that is a sin). It doesn't matter though, if I get forced out of this family I'll just go and live with my auntie who already has five kids - I'm sure she won't notice another one.  God, right now a load of cheesy American people are waving at the camera. I would go on a big rant and slag off American people, but just in case any American people ever read this, I'll just say that the majority of them really give me the creeps, although I'm sure lots of them are very nice (maybe).  My brother is here again - this time he wants me to play his new pirate game with him. I've already played it three times, and he beat me every time (which is rather humiliating), so I'm not that eager to play it again, especially as it's  shit . I always feel guilty for neglecting him though, so I'll probably end up playing the damn thing again in five minutes.  Yay Venus and Chanda won the second set! Sorry, I promise this will be the last time I mention the tennis in my blog. Today.  Daniel
