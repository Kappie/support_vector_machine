I'm supposed to be going to Sonya's church on Friday when I get back home, YAY!!! Then like on Saturday I am going to LinZ's house to watch "Secret Window" and Sonya might be coming. So yeah I'm kind of upset because my classes for Rich East didn't come yet and almost EVERYbody else got thier's already. But the only reason I'm making a mountain out of a mole hill is because I like school and I want to see if I got all the classes I wanted and I'm kinda sorta not really excited about going to RE, but hey, I gotta make the best out of it ya' know.    OMG CHICHI'S LEAVIN ON FRIDAY AND I WON'T BE ABLE TO TELL HER BYE IN PERSON, CHICHI GET ON AIM I WANNA TALK TO YOU. PLEASE PLEASE CHICHI GET  ON AIM. You just gotta love the Chi-ster I mean it's hard not to. Got to love her just got to. *muah* that's for all you people that want a kiss from me but won't admit it ( my way of being a concieted jerk aka arrogant person * mi amigos know that I'm hardly ever that way, if you don't shame on you, because you need to spend more time with me*)
