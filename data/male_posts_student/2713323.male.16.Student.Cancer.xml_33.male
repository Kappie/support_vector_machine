Hmm..then i went to Funan to get albums with kel and went for a haircut at the same time...i tried the "student" haircut for fun, which was like, dirt cheap, 5.95. But it was really a budget haircut, i had to sit there and wait for 10 mins and the hairstylist didnt know what she was doing...she had to stop and ask her superior every 10 secs on instructions. I really got pissed off, wanted to leave just like that, but nah, since im so kind-hearted i just told her that im late for a tution class. Then i left and went to orchard to get a proper one...went for sushi after, stuff myself with seafood and rice. DOH. Oh yeah i bought gengs present...well, todays his birthday so...yeah...ciao.
