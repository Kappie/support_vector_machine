We started the practice with weights, so we could get good and tired before we did anything. We went on the turf, and it was so damn hot! Today was the hottest day of the summer, and the next two days are supposed to top that. I have a shot a varsity this year, and I'm not sure about the outcome, I'm what they call "on the bubble", but I would say I have a good chance at making it. So, for now I get all of the privilege of varsity, but I'm not on the team yet. I went to Chipotle after practice, and I think I'll do that almost every day, I love that place! The coaches tell us that we need to eat a lot when were resting, I don't have a problem with that, but I'm trying to lose weight, so I'm trying to eat healthy. Also, it's almost my birthday, only three more days till I can drive! My truck is ready to go, and right after practice my dad will take me to get my license, I can't wait! I've run out of stuff to talk about, so I'll go for now.
