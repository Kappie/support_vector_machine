That was one thing that happened today. Other stuff.....I'll write about in the following couple paragraphs....    So as usual, I sleep for most of the morning, and I wake up at 1230 today after finally somehow getting tired of sleeping. I read up some more PDL, and then headed downstairs for the meal that most people know as lunch.    By now it was already 130. Today consisted of leftover pizza from Pizza Pizza. Before that, and during the reheating of the pizza, I somehow managed to watch through some of the tennis US Open. It was Agassi and some other dude, and it was a close game. Basically I can watch any game that seems either clutch or evenly matched I think. So after watching a bit of tennis, I ate, and then SCed for a bit of the afternoon. First time I played an Alamo match in a long time, probably only the certain few know what I'm talking about, and then after some of that, Calvin came over, and we headed to UCC.    Today at UCC....I'm trying to get style back into my stuff.........my footwork I've noticed now is actually terrible. AND I MANAGED TO LINK 3 MILLS.....well sort of....they were ugly but at least I didn't stop this time. Then after some breaking, came home again....      Days can be so short when I wake up late....but yeah.....so came home, ate some dinner, then watched some TV.    I've actually never really noticed how the show South Park can be so politically/international issues...ly active. It was kind of funny, today's episode on the Comedy Network was one that focused on the child molesting issue a while back with the Catholic priests. I find it interesting how they can make the show still funny, yet at the same time show you the serious problems these international issues can bring up. So yeah, over the summer, I've come to tolerate watching the following on TV now:    -South Park  -CFL football  -Baseball (don't ask)  -Tennis    Oh yeah....and reality TV is still looming around on the screen, so yeah I can still catch some of that junk.....though I'm still not a big fan of much of it.    Anyways I think that's all the ranting I have for today.    Bye.
