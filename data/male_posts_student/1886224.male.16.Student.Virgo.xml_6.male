I enjoy playing video games, hanging with friends, and playing sports (baseball is my fav). I'm a big Yankees fans and an expert ATV rider. Hopefully I would love to race one day. I'm interested in what people say/think about my site, so please comment on the site and I look forward to hearing from you guys.
