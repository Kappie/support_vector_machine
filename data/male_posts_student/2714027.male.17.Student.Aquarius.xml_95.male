Today I discovered that there's a party on the 17th over at a friend's house and more importantly, that the girl from the party in early May (long story, see the archives) will be there. She and my friend split up a few weeks after they got together at that party, so now she's single again. A second chance for me, maybe.  I can prepare this time around though, although the task is even harder. All the conversation topics you can use when you've just met someone are gone, but I've got too keep chatting for as long as possible. She's half French, which I didn't know last time, so I might try using that, if I talk to her at all. You see, I don't want to hang around and hassle her, but I still want to let her know I'm interested. A tricky task, but definitely do-able. Maybe I won't like her as much this time round though. There might be someone even nicer there; you just never know. I'll find out when I get there I guess.  School has been a bit of a joke recently, with only three lessons per day out of a possible five. Yesterday I had three free periods, then took some new first years round the school and today I had three free periods, then Maths, then came home. Still, it's better than having to work hard though.  Even with so few lessons and the lack of work to do, I feel generally tired and drained, with a serious lack of any enthusiasm for working. I just want to go on holiday for three weeks with my family and friend, and just relax in the sun.  I've been playing a lot of  Pro Evolution Soccer 3  recently, especially its Master League mode, which is eating up my time like... uh, me eating a cake... Hmm, something like that anyway.  Anyway, until next time...
