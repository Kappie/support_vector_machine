Back to my point - while at the debate thing, through the use of many asides I essentially learned the history of the world. And the funny thing is that a lot of it had to do with Philadelphia. If I remember some of them it goes a little something like this: The marines were assembled from Philly bars, meaning that the guys were vicious, ready to fight, and could be easily coaxed into a drunken rage (okay, I added that last one). Then there was the story about how Philly is the only city to have ever bombed itself. And now my mind fails me - as I remember, I'll post more, but for now, I'm getting breakfast.  -mikeo  "Do not be too moral. You may cheat yourself out of much life. Aim above morality. Be not simply good; be good for something" - Henry David Thoreau
