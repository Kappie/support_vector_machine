By now we can all write 9-caliber essays with the right inspiration, and the multiple choice is less perilous than you give it credit for.  The tests we've taken from the books are meant to trick you- beat you on a technicality and so forth.  So much so that the objective (I hope) is to get you to read the questions so closely, you don't get fooled on the test.  However, there is evidence for hope.  The test that I gave a link to in my last post, was a sample test written by the college board... after a 50% on the Peterson's test, I got an 80% on the real one... that's a huge improvement.  It's also great for confidence.  We can do this, class!!!  The best advice I can give is to know the literary terms like the back of your hand... what they are, how they're used, and how you can recognize them in a passage.  That's the heart of these questions, and if you can identify those terms, you will have success.  Love, Rob
