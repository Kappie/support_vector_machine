Well, i was listening to the song ' urlLink Renegades ' (hence the title of the album), and it got me thinking.  This is what i thought about.  What do you think a renegade is?  It sounds sort of evil to some, to some it might sound heroic, but what is the deffinition of a renegade?  In the song it says 'Now renegades are the people with their own philosophies, They change the course of history, Everyday people like you and me...'  and i would think that to be fairly accurate.  Renegades are people who have a unique view on life that may change the world as we know it, but they aren't all that special, just normal people.    I also went to dictionary.com to find out what it had to say about renegades: 1. One who rejects a religion, cause, allegiance, or group for another; a deserter. 2. An outlaw; a rebel.  Now, that doesn't sound so good, they desert others, they aren't trustworthy, they rebel against others.  Thats not good at all.    So, who would was a renegade?  Some examples the song gives are Cheif Sitting Bull, Tom Paine, Dr. Martin Luther King, and Malcom X.  Now, i don't know most of the people mentioned, but i do know that Martin Luther King was a good man, fighting for Black Rights.  He doesn't sound so bad.    From what i have looked at here, a renegade is a person who has his own views on life, they are ordinary people with vision, and they will do anything to have their views realized and accepted, even if they have to betray other people. Renegades are radicals that want to help or hinder the world, that is up to them. All i can say is, i am NOT a renegade.   Lates
