Now that you know a little about my family and the town I grew up in, we turn to my development.  I was something of a quiet kid.  I was never terribly popular in Middle School or High School, but Middle School was my real low point.  I simply didn't understand myself.  It was during my seventh and eighth grade years that I began realizing that my fantasies were about other boys, not girls.  It is odd, as I reflect on those times.  I was so confused.  I didn't know why I liked to fantasize about boys, I just did.  And, I was filled with guilt over it.  I suppose the one word that described me during that time was shame.  Though I very rarely acted out in any way during that time in my life, I was filled with shame.  Middle School was my low point because it was my most confused time and because it was my most sad time.  I cried a lot back then because I didn't understand me.  (Little did I know that some of that was simply the normal process of adolescence.)  Oddly enough, I can remember the exact moment I first realized I was gay.  It was the summer between seventh and eighth grade.  I had gone to spend the night at one of my friend's houses.  That night we joked around and flirted before going to bed.  Once we were in bed my friend made a pass at me and touched me sexually.  I was scared.  Nothing more happened, but I was furious about it the next morning.  I was furious and full of shame.  BUT, later that afternoon, I started flirting with my friend and realized that I wanted him to touch me again.  That was the moment I knew something was different about me.  It was at this point that my closeted life began.  I began trying to repress my attractions as best I could.  It wasn't that I simply didn't want to be gay.  It was that I knew I would go to hell for it.  That is what I had been taught.  So, I lived in fear of hell and full of shame.  ...I was a delightful Christian though.  I was funny and I laughed a lot...  But all of that was a cover.  It was what I did to hide my true identity from those around me.  "Luckily," my friend moved to a new school for eighth grade, so my secret was safe for now.  I told no one.  It was a battle I fought alone in the darkness.  I was dreadfully alone.  It seemed as if no one else in the world had the same problem.  Oddly enough, of the four guys that made up my closest friends during that time...all of them are gay today...but none of us ever spoke of it back then.  Where were blind to the fact that we were all walking the same hard road, never realizing we could have helped one another along.  This is why we the silence must end.  There must be discussion.  So that others don't have to walk alone.  Next time I will pick up with HIGH SCHOOL.
