There would have never been a then nor a future, just a constant now. It's as hard to put into words as it is to grasp. So basically, ya... Feel free to tag me or ask me on msn bout it ya?  Anonymous, please feel free to use your name or a nick if you please. The comment you made sounds like something a New Creation member would say. I do believe that the 10 commandments are very applicable, even in today's context. Some things never loose their meaning, friend. One thing we have to do is humble ourselves and realize, that we're still sinners, no matter what we do right or wrong. Keep posting dude. Good to have discussion.  On a lighter note, I think my wisdom teeth are coming out. I can almost reach 'em with my tongue. Was out with Rayner till pretty late. He's very nice to talk to and there's a fountain of knowledge which just flows from him. He knows the market and he knows things. He's a lady's man, a definite Leopold. What a rocker. Talented musician and not a show off at all..  Results will be out tomorrow. Very nervous. The more I think about it, the more I think that I'll get 17 or something. God forbid. Still, "Thy will be done"
