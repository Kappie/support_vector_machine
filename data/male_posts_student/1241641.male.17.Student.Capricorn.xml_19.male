I think this means I practically have to mention John Kerry's choice of running mate.  Once Kerry clinched the nomination with Edwards coming up in second, I played with the idea of a Kerry-Edwards ticket; I liked it.  Edwards' energy, charisma, and message all compliment Sen. Kerry very well.  His "two Americas" message (one for the people doing very well, the other for those struggling to make ends meet) bites hard at the agenda of the Bush-Cheney administration.  This dynamic duo will surely give the Bush-Cheney campaign a run for their money and their jobs.  Of course the Bush-Cheney campaign has launched a counterattack.  The call Sen. John McCain Kerry's "first choice" and then play some slightly out of context audio clips of McCain talking about Bush (his mounds of criticisms of the war in Iraq are edited out).  And let's remember no one offered McCain a seat on the ticket.  I have talked plenty about Bush and Kerry, but what about Nader?  Now he is accusing the Democratic party of dirty tricks in Arizona.  The Democrats challenged the validity of hundreds of signatures to get Nader on the ticket.  Invalid signatures sounds more like a dirty trick than making sure election laws are followed.  And to make matters worse, the company that is making the electronic ballot machines (which create no physical record of every single vote in the event of a recount) have promised a Bush victory.  If that does not scare anyone, I don't know what would.  Insist on a paper ballot. Insist on UN election inspections.
