I always sleep with my light on, but I don't really fear the dark, I just always sleep with my light on.  Plus I hate it when those hairy spiders bite you, they look nasty and well, I don't like anything hairy and nasty crawling on me.  Those are about the only ones I can think of right now - but trust me, there are way more. I Never feared a lot of things like heights, fire, or storms and stuff like that.  So, what exactly is my GREATEST FEAR?  My greatest fear would definitely getting to the judgment seat of Christ and not being written in the book of life!  I know that isn't going to happen, but it would be horrific if it were.  I had a dream about that one time, actually.  Anyway, fears are not always bad for you!  There is definitely I good side of fear.  If I didn't fear not being written in the book of life - I Wouldn't be written in it - cause I just wouldn't care!  For real, if I weren't afraid of those nasty spiders, I'd probably have some contagious disease with bumps all over my face.  That would be bad.  So, use your fears for good, and if necessary you can always conquer them by facing them.  Alrighty then, that's the end of this journal! And....  That's how we do things round herrrrre.  I'm Will - see ya'll later.
