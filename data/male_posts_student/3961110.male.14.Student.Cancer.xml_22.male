I want something to be quality, not a rushed piece of crap. As you can see, I haven't beenon the netrecenty due to the fact I didnt have time, having a job, then the CDRW drivers failing and crashing as I watched The Matrix: Reloaded in the drive, and then to find out the flopply drive had done a kari-kari and died on me, randomly. So I had to get a new floppy,try to fix the problem unsucessfully with the CDRW, etc etc. I wont be on the next few days either as I have to work outthe optimummethod of networking my dads 30+ pcs which includes PIII500s, P4 1.4s, P4 1.7s, 2.4, 2.8, and many more, some on linux (different versions), some on windows 2k, some on XP!!!And then I have to build my dads new PC when it comes,which is good :) At the moment,the deadline is far too unreasonable for me, sorry folks, though if you really want, I'll send you what I have. I want it to be good, and I do not want any work rushed to achieve the deadline, though I do admit it is not a bad idea. I'm glad Beckett did this to motive the team.
