I mean, why the fuck can i not open my .mpeg files?, just necause i changed the fil name doesnt mean i cant open it, how come windows media player, lets me play them, stupid quicktime, the quicker that they let me play my movie, the better, because then i can actually start editing them, but grrrr quicktime, joiin me in destroying the company, unless it lets me play my movies.
