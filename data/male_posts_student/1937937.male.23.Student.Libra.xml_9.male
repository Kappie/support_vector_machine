The biggest joke: the FCAT truly is meaningless.  When tenth graders fail the FCAT, they have the opportunity to "retake" it in their junior and senior years.  That's all well and good, but because the FDOE (pronounced 'fftdoh', also known as the Florida Department of Education) can't actually let anyone  fail  the FCAT, they've instituted a new test format intended  only  for those students doing retakes.  The new test format is designed "to save time in scoring the tests"; however, a coincidental side effect of this time saving process is that the revised FCAT is much easier then the FCAT given to 10th grade students their first time around.
