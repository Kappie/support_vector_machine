I was born in Poland, and now I'm 15 years old, my life was going just find until I came to Portugal with my family in for holiday. The first couple of days I did nothing but sitting in the apartment my dad had rented and fighting with my brother or sister. After few days my dad took us to the ocean. I thought Portugal had a wonderful view from the coast, with a splendid sunset far away in the middle of the ocean... But I was wrong. The beach was dirty with hundreds of broken clams, the sand was dirty and smelled like few thousands of rotten fish swimming in sewer instead of ocean. This was the first four days from our "trip". Few days later I went to the beach once more, I was nine years by then, this time we went without my dad. My mom allowed me to go take a bath because a friend of my dad was there with us and she though he would help if something would happen to us, she was wrong... It didn't took long before the ocean "sucked" me into a much distant area, the man who was supposed take care of me had the same problem (I think) and swimmed to the beach. After few whiles I saw my mom swimming towards me, but the waves increased and turned things much worst. After few whiles I reached my mother and we tried to come back to beach, unluckily something seemed to be pushing her down under the water, I tried to reach her for few seconds but I hadn't a good pulmonary capacity, so I had to go back to the surface. When I submerged once more I did'n saw my mom.  When I understood I wasn't strong enough to help her I swam few meters near the quay, I grabbed two rocks and waited a while looking for a path to swim to the quay. Finally I got out of the water and I realized I was all in slashes made by clams and stones. Finally on the beach I saw my mom lying on the sand, surrounded by medics.  Later that day my father called me, my brother and my sister into his room. He told us that our mom was dead during the transport to the hospital. I think this were the saddest days of my life :(
