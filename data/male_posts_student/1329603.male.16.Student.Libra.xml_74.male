Tried to flirt as much as humanly possible, it resulted in me flirting as much as is possible for me which isn't a lot, but I think she may have picked up on it at any rate. I think I've disturbed her now... lame. She had a weird top that made it look like I was staring at her breasts but I wasn't! I was just looking at the weird non-sensical ribbons... I wasn't looking at breasts, I promise!! Really! *whines*  Zoe's been complimenting me indirectly tonight ^_^. Thankee Zoe! It means a lot to my self confidence.  Recently I've been feeling very down, very ill, and very tired. I apologise, but I doubt if this will change in the forseeable future. I am ill. I am tired. I am down. But I survive on the fact I'm a trombonist and a singer which is why I look so stuck up at times, I'm sorry. But take them away from me and I shall be indeed alone. Poor fellow.  Hm, thinking about to-Miller, bet your bottom dollar that to-Miller...  Also thinking about Zoe a lot now. Ah well, life continues.  ...Dr. Abbot said GYO need me. That's almost an official plea. I just need the head of GYO to ask and then 3 of the County music heads have told me that. Heavens above. What is the world coming to when I'M that needed? For crying out loud. It's not as if I'm even THAT good!  Miller, I underestimated your coolness.  Quote of the day: "The world is too much with us; late and soon, Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers: Little we see in Nature that is ours; We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon! The Sea that bares her bosom to the moon; The winds that will be howling at all hours, And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers; For this, for everything, we are out of tune; It moves us not. - Great God! I'd rather be A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn; So might I, standing on this pleasant lea, Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn; Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea; Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn."  Wordsworth's   "The World is Too Much with Us; Late and Soon"   Love, Jon Roskilly
