If you've got the patience to read it, then in my opinion its greatly worth it as an honest insight into popular music today:      Everyone is a Capitalist in the Music Biz: But They're Not All In It For the Cash    The term immediately hurled at a band that has become popular is the evil little title of "sell out".  This term is so easily shoveled out when a single from a long time underground success becomes a regular on the radio.  Now, though it may be fun to say mean bits about bands we don't like, what happens when it's a band you truly respect?  What if you still like the new stuff?  [Gasp]  Does that mean your band has dragged you down into the realm of "crappy music"?  Worse yet, what if you hate the new single from your long time favorite band?  Have they sold their soul for a bit of fame? NO!  I was perusing the "From the Masses" section of this magazine a while back and came across a very, well shall we say honest, reaction to an article regarding the song "Deep".  Well, I went back through the article that spawned such a very "emotional" response from a reader.  The article was a writer's opinion on the apparent lack of musicianship on the track.  Now, I will admit I did not think that "Deep" was Reznor's finest hour but, it had a certain simple quality I was not used to from Nine Inch Nails.  It got me to thinking about the intention behind the song.  Did Reznor really lend his music to an album just to cash in?  Not necessarily.   Yes, this track was a departure from what we have come to know and love about Nine Inch Nails, but I think it is that very thing which leads to Nine Inch Nails to be such an interesting band.  The sound they have produced has never been the same regurgitation, over and over, again re-packaged and re-released (for reference please see: Creed.)  They have not found a set formula for each album and become stagnant with the comfort of a working system of creation (see also: Limp Bizkit.).  I think variation and a constant evolution is essential to the progression of music.  Not every facet of the evolution process is going to be pretty.  All Darwinist's, I think, would agree that some of our post monkey, pre-modern human stages were a little less than beautiful. My point being, yes "Deep" did not exhibit the usual musical power previously wielded by Reznor.  However, this does not mean "Deep" is the end all be all of Nine Inch Nails.  It was not meant to be the culmination of the efforts of those involved with the project.  It was a song that Reznor was likely comfortable with releasing because he felt it would accomplish the one thing he set out to do: make music.  Not every song is going to be a paramount piece of work.  If there were a way to accomplish that, the music world would never change.  Music is a system of trial and error.  If everything had been completely sussed out then the production of new music would be redundant and, well, pointless.   It is ridiculous to fault a musician for making a song you don't like.  For most people good music is not something easily defined.  We will like music depending on how it connects with us.  We all have a song we may not admit to liking in public but secretly do nonetheless because it holds some sort of special memory or emotion for us.  The goal of creating good music is to create music that envelops the listener in a world of pure emotion through the shaping of sound waves and the manipulation of visual images projected from the writer, either through lyrics or through pure musical expression.  I do think "Deep" accomplished that, though maybe, as I said, not to the same level as, let's say, "Something I Can Never Have".  Reznor probably just wanted to vent and it came out as "Deep".   The reader who responded to the article, Mr. Self Destruct, also pointed out a very honest fact: "The song "Deep" is simply just a spur-of-the-moment-to-make-some-fucking-money-song.  If it took you five years every time to record a brilliant album, I'm pretty sure you'd want to release a bullshit pop song every once in a while too.  What use is a mind made for making music if you can't afford to eat Ramen noodles?"  We all often forget music is a business as well.  You have to have money to be able to sustain yourself for five years so you can put together a fantastic album. While I do not agree "Deep" was a "spur-of-the-moment-to-make-some-fucking-money-song", I do think that putting it on the Lara Croft: Tomb Raider soundtrack may have been a way to generate a bit of revenue.  But also look at the greater scheme of things.  By putting the song on a more popular venue Reznor was able to share his feelings with people who may have NEVER dreamt of even listening to Nine Inch Nails.  Yes, is was shocking to have a NIN song share an album with a Missy Elliot song but does doing this invalidate all Trent Reznor has done in the past?  Does this mean he now only wants to make money?  Is Tapeworm only going to be a CD of "Deep" remixed 12 "new" ways?  No.   As far as the claim that the release of halos with re releases of songs we have already heard were done for the mere purpose of making money, again look at the bigger picture. Most of the halos with re-releases on them weren't released in America.  The "We're In This Together" singles (which is my guess as to which albums Curtis Westman was referring to) were released in Sweden, again exposing a new fan base to the music of Nine Inch Nails.   This isn't to say there are not bands out there that do in fact make music solely for the money and fame aspects of the endeavor, but just because a band makes a song that might be more palatable to a new realm of fans does not mean the band has sold out or is now just in it for the money.  That only happens when a band finds a sound that works and beats the particular horse until it bleeds a painful death (refer again to: Limp Bizkit).  Innovation and variation have to be balanced with a business sense.  Though Reznor may not have sold his soul to Carson Daley or whatever tool hosts TRL now, he did take advantage of MTV when he saw it could get his music to the masses.  He sat and talked with his share of VJs.  The one constant, though, has been everything he has produced has been a new experience for him.  If it leads a parallel with your life or mindset and you further enjoy the song, great, if not you'll just have to see what lies over the next hill.  Music is not a level path easily navigated.  It is rather a varied plethora of artistic expression and as long the music is constantly following that path; it is a brilliant artist behind the music.  It is only when music finds a comfortable spot on the path and sets up shop there that makes for awful mind-numbing music.  So yes, there are people making money with music.  Music can be a product used for financial gain, just as a painter may do a commissioned piece.  But there are also those who just wish to capitalize on the chance to share a glimpse of their emotion at the time.  Andy Worhol painted portraits with the same pattern on the same size canvas for money to fund his studio, but the portraits were also being produced on the same size canvas because he planned to put them together to form a giant mosaic made up of all the people he had painted.  He had a greater vision.  I think that just because Reznor made something with a more pop sensibility, it does not make him a sell-out; there is still a library of work to come.  "Deep" may just be the small piece, the single tile, in a much larger mosaic of artistic expression, a single step upon a very long road we have not come to the end of yet.            xBuBzx
