Now, I went and got Spiderman 2 for my Xbox last week, and I have no flaws with it.  The difficulty is perfect, the graphics are awesome.  When there is sound, its awesome.  So what could be possibly wrong with this game?  Well, it's the best movie to game translation I've seen this year, in fact...ever.  (The Shrek 2 game would have been that title, too, and so would Chronicles of Riddick).  Have we seen the end of bad movie-to-game translations?  No, not necessarily, but, we're seeing a lot more good ones.  Anyway.  I'll start out by talking about the storyline, and if you haven't seen the movie, ignore it.  The story is essentially the same as the movie, but, has some different things, like extra bosses, such as Rhino, Shocker (my personal favorite), and Mysterio.  Of course, you'll be fighting Doc Ock in this game, too, since he is in fact the enemy that you are dealing with in the actual storyline of the movie.  In fact, here's a breakdown of each boss:  Rhino- Just appears out of nowhere.  His difficulty is somewhere around a medium.  You have to dodge his attacks before you can attack, and if you miss, you have to wait until the next time he tries to get you.  Mysterio- This is the most annoying part of the game.  Quentin Beck, a Hollywood director, first challenges Spidey to a little matchup, where he has to get more criminals in these tanks.  Then, you have to complete his obstacle course.  Then, later on, Quentin holds a press conference, where he holds reporters hostage and becomes Mysterio, and Spidey must save all of the reporters and defeat these drone like things.  Then, Mysterio creates this "brain" that is trying to take over the Statue of Liberty, surrounding it in a electric field.  You have to swing all the way out there on these little overhead platforms (which aren't easy to get to the end of), take out 8 orbs and defeat this "brain."  Then, you'll end up in a funhouse, where you'll have to pass through clones of yourself that come out of mirrors.  Then, that's it...there's no actual boss battle that goes along with it.  Shocker- You'll fight Shocker twice, and he is actually the easiest boss in the game.  Just dodge his electric attacks, and you'll be fine against him.    Doc Ock- You'll fight him three times.  Once, he kidnaps Aunt May and tries to take her away via Helicopter.  Then, he'll kidnap Mary Jane, and you'll have to defeat him on a train.  That's where the second part of it begins.  You'll then end up in a warehouse, where you'll have to disarm 9 switches before being able to hit him.  Then, you'll defeat him, and then, the game is over...at least, the story part is.  This game has outstanding replay value.  After you beat the story mode, you are only 50% complete with the game.  There are so many more awards to unlock, and in order to complete the game, you have to accumilate 50,000 more hero points.  There's so much to do, so many places to go... that it makes this game even more fun.  The cool thing about Spiderman 2 is that it is a GTA-like game, allowing you to wander all around the city in search of something to do.  Webslinging has never been more fun, as you can go to the top of the Empire State Building, fall off of it, and practically kill yourself.  Hahaha.  No.  That's not funny.  But, being able to travel throughout New York City is very fun. You'll find something new every day.  I have yet to complete the final chapter, which is completing the 50,000 hero points, but, I'll make it eventually.  There's so many more awards to unlock that I haven't yet.  I can't wait to get them all!  You have Daily Bugle missions to complete, Pizza delivery missions to complete, and on top of that, earning your awards by finishing the arcade games, saving people, and destroying enemy tanks!  There is so much to do in Spiderman 2, and it really sets it aside from most games.  This is the best movie-to-game translation I have ever played, and one of the best games that I have played all year.  Definitely give this one a shot, it's available on Xbox, GameCube, PS2, GBA, PC, and NGAGE.   Pros  +Sweet Graphics +Open-Ended Gameplay +Sweet difficulty   Cons  -Mysterio is ANNOYING! -Steep difficulty may not be for everyone   Score  Fun Factor: 100%-A Graphics/Layout: 95%-A Speed: 100%-A Customization/Controls: 100%-A Final: 98.75%-A Gold!
