I don't know if he got the message or not. He had an away message up and I told him everything, but he signed off so I don't know if he got the message or not. I have to tell him it was a joke because friendship is more important then companionship,which is something I figured out a little too late. ::cries:: I want to shoot myself now! Now I will tell you what happened earlier this week. Ryan came over on monday, it was raining out so we couldn't sleep out in the tent. The next day we hung out and we got into a tv remote war. I had the remote and he was trying to get it from me. We got so close to each other that if I moved an inch closer I would be kissing him. But, I just couldn't do it even though I really wanted to. I got him to stay another night in hopes of having a second chance and we slept out in the tent. That did no good except that in the middle of the night I found him wraped around me but I don't think he did it on purpose. The next day nothing happened and when he left I became very depressed because I know I won't be able to see him for another month and a half because I am going on vacation. I sent that message to him today and I have been freaking out ever since. I just want to die. Other than that not much is going on so I will TTYL.
