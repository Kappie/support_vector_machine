I never thought something like this would happen to me n my family..never. Just becos of that bitch..my life..my family..were ruined. ("Lawan tetap lawan." This saying do exist in my life...)  Hmm..sayang..i enjoyed every single moment i spent with you. I never regret being with you..but i would regret for not being with u. U're everything in my life and becos of u..i am keen to live even longer. You gave me everything u got..and i do appreciate it. I really really love u so much and my love to u will never ever end. I hope our relationship will stay like this till i closed my eyes.. ;)  Ive got lots of work to do tonite. Arranging my GP file, doing my  essays..and most importantly..tepon my sayang..Nurul Assyirah Nadhirah. ;) Rindu kali ah..bulih.. :p   Thats all i guess for today...i'll write again some other time..maybe tomorrow. Love you so much sayang.. *muahz*
