I didn't get near enough sleep last night, even though I slept in for half an hour... and I went to sleep at 10:30, and woke up at 7:30... Sleep is good...  Later  I'm sad now... No one is sitting next to this sad little monkey.  Perhaps if I was more, um, with... the... uh, helping... people would sit next to me... The only people who are nice to me are Ben Hackett, Theo and Ryo. Yet, all is not lost. I'm playing defend your castle at arcadetown.com, and I'm up to level 11 or 12. BOOYAH! Comments about my predicament would be nice... The Amazing MonkeyMan Ben Smith
