Many of the students here who have come to know me are also disappointed. I see it as leaving the hand that helped me up, eventually you have to continue down the sidewalk. While being here I have discovered myself by being myself. I know now that the only reason I was here in the first place was because of myself and the things I have done. 'honor the truth, then fix yourself.' all I can say about that is, Mission Accomplished. I would've never guessed that I would leave here with the possibility of graduating on time. Hard work and determination have paid off but to say I wont succeed is a mockery to this school. 'a mans success is determined by the obstacles he has overcome.' Today closes a chapter in my life story. It also starts the rest of My Life.
