I have to clean the house today. We are cleaning the basement workshop so we can get the boxes wired up for ethernet, phone and cable tv. Biatch. I was denied entry to "Bad Santa" at my local theater, the Capitol. I was, needless to say, pissed off. Who denies teenagers who aren't 17, but look even older? For those of you who don't know me personally, I'm 6' 5", 220 lbs. I look older than 17. So instead of watching the movie we went home.
