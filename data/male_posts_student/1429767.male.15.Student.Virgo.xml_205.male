(Mis)leads America". It is by far the best book about politics that I've ever read. I'm only into the second chapter but so far it is  really  good, the stuff that Bush does behind America's back is astonishing! For example: in Bush's 2000 presidential campaign he vowed to protect the enviroment by implementing tougher pollution laws and putting a stop to logging industries hunger for more wood. Well, it turns out those statements were both lies, since Bush's campaign was and still is funded by many big oil companies and logging companies he actually made pollution laws voluntary which according to his theory will make the companies want to clean up some how... Then take this for another example, Bush started a "Clear Skies Initiative" according to Bush it would set lower pollution levels on Sulfur Dioxide, Nitrogen Oxides, and Mercury in Bush's words: "Clear Skies will reduce air pollution from power plants by seventy percent, the most significant step America has ever taken to address this problem--while using a market-based system to keep electricity prices affordable for hardworking Americans." wow, that sounds like good plan doesn't it? Listen to this though, on a short term basis, Bush's plan allowed 125 percent more sulfur dioxide, 68 percent more nitrogen oxide, and 425 percent more mercury than laws already in place. Now going back to his statement, did it clean anything up? No. Did it drive electricity costs down? No. He actually put the laws into place to drive costs down to the electric companies, they didn't have to spend money on pollution prevention, Bush claims it saves money, sure it does for the electric companies but costs billions of dollars to an increased number of hospitalizations. Honestly when will someone stop him?
