Anyway, I've switched gears to where my talents seem to be, comedy, as evidence by my first ever screenplay, the every-funny "Racewalkers." And now, I'm cruising along on my new comedy, like 20 pages already, because comedy just flows for me for some reason...  Anyway, it's tentatively called "Murphy's Law" because that's what the movie is based on, but man! somebody already took that title, and Salma Hayek is in it, and it's in production right now!! Oh the humanity!!  So, I'm going to have to change the title, I'm open to suggestions, trust me, but I was thinking something like simply "Murphy" or "Murphy Was Right" or who cares, I can figure that out later, plus I don't even think the name Murphy should be in the title, now I'm just babbling, but the movie is about three groups of people, and everything instinctively goes wrong for them, and somehow their paths all cross and in the end, and then...well thats for me now isn't it....  Also:  For some reason, I wish I owned these songs, because I have to settle for repeatedly clicking on the 30 second preview for my useless iTunes [no iPod!]  1. Float On - Modest Mouse  2. Sic Transit Gloria - Brand New  Both not the greatest in terms of lyrics probably, but some of the most unique and original beats around.  3. Rest in Pieces - Saliva  Their only good one, just brilliant.
