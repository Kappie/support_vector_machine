One of the more sublime ways in which I like to decieve people is by subjecting them to relative obscurities which bear a marked resemblance to far more acclaimed acts.  In 1997, this was far easier as bait-and-switching Fugazi for Mission of Burma was always a productive gambit.  Today as bands like Mission of Burma experience a revival in their popularity and the new wave of punk/snob/indie bands mine such absolute unknowns as Human League for their sounds my fix is becoming harder and harder to obtain.  I can always rely on Swervedriver to deceive the odd errant Braid fan, but these are a dying breed.  The first My Bloody Valentine album ( urlLink No, not this one, you amateur .  urlLink Not even this one, but nice try and we should date  ( urlLink are you busy Thursday night ?).   urlLink This one . Yeah.) is absurdly a near-dead ringer for the Murder City Devils.  It also takes a while to grow on you, but that's beside the point.  They are lowdown, mean, straight-ahead rock songs, any one of which would have made a better b-side for "Dancing Shoes" than "Tokyo Gold".  More absurd even than this, the resemblance of the Murder City Devils to an absurd early-career, pre-Bilinda and Debbie, totally atypical MBV obscurity, is the apparent source of some of Fugazi's cribs.  Fugazi have to date pulled at least a riff and a solo, if not substantial portions of the Guy Piccioto guitar oeuvre from Apaslar's 1969 national hit single, "Gilgamesh".  If you've never heard it, you're not alone, because the nation in question is the Republic of Turkey.  The song however appears to be the Urquell or at least the inspiration for "Life and Limb" as well as "Closed Captioned".  The solo near the end has in fact prompted at least two people in my direct personal experience to say "Is this Fugazi?";  I've also gotten one "so this is that One Last Wish thing, huh?"  I personally have access to the song as it is included on  urlLink this compilation ; it would be totally unsurprising to discover this disc on offer at any old Washington DC record store.  I however prefer to believe a far more complicated and danger-fraught web of transmission, which you would understand if you would watch  The French Connection  already.
