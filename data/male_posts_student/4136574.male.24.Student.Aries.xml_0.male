Strange that I get better with alcohol, but mostly I think I revert to my normal/hyper state. Writing this blog is calming me down. Really I just need sleep. Elissa had another date tonight. Some online guy over here. And Brian, her online love, is coming this weekend. The guy that was a large part of her leaving me I think. She thought I'd date before her, but then tried to have sex with random people days after breaking up (or was it the night of?). Anyway, yeah, it'll be a while before I date I imagine, but we'll see.  Maybe Lisa will come into town this weekend and I'll have a distraction from Elissa and whatever crap she's up to. Though I don't much care, her sleeping with some online love may end up bothering me. We'll have to see. Drama is just another challenge for me. I enjoy losing at things because of the challenge  and I've certainly lost a few battles with maturity in the last few weeks. Still... no huge mistakes, so I'm okay. Survive and grow stronger. Nietzsche said "whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger", but some real Nietzsche fans always stick the "in war" part in front.  Anyway, the alcohol: tonight Kelly got a call from Matt inviting her over to swim with him. She invited me, Elissa, and Jamay. We went and had some drinks and fun. Matt and his friends are cool. Osama Bin Laden looks like he wants to sleep with me now, so I'm gonna go. Peace out homies.
