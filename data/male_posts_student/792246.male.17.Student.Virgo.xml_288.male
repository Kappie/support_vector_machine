Professor Carr seems to steadfastly believe in the often quoted but rarely true statement of "For every hour, prepare to spend two hours working outside of class". So she is nice enough to provide us with two hours of homework every night. Isn't that sweet? She also spent five minutes being overly sympathetic for us having to take high school math in college. It was kind of bordering on just plain rude. These five minutes also culminated in her amazingly helpful education on using our "I wills" versus our "IQs'. Isn't that just dainty?  Astronomy on the other hand is the most awesome class ever. It's the first class I've taken in a lecture hall, so it's everything I imagined college to be and more. Professor Fraknoi is a lovable and silly Hungarian man who I would never have guessed that English is not the first language for. Picture Jonathan's dad, but Hungarian. He also talks endlessly about how no prior math or science skill is assumed in the course, and instead focuses on "sexy topics" (Which is, thankfully for all of our funny bones, a term he uses frequently) He finished today's class with a series of slides which were really gorgeous, and when it was time to go, for possibly the first time in my life I wished for a minute that class was longer.   On Mondays, such as today, I then walk the very long trip to across the hall into a classroom where we have an honors seminar in astronomy. This basically means sitting around talking about astronomy. The only work for the class is one 3-5 page paper, which is good. I already have a topic in mind. I'm going to talk about Linguistics and Astronomy, as in how astronomy terms have entered casual conversation and slang. Stellar or astronomical, for instance.  Monday and Wednesday nights I have Japanese. I've discovered that ますだ先生 never really taught me anything, as half the terms they reviewed on the first night I didn't know. Considering that it's Japanese 3 and I've taken  more  than two years of Japanese, that should say something. My teacher is adorable, and there are two adorable student aides.  It's Pesach. My mom bought a whole bunch of leavened products today forgetting this. So I gorged before class. And I mean gorged. And god was the gorging good.
