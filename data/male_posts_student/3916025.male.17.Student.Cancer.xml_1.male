That will be up and running as soon as I can finish that. I really don't have any plans for today although I do have Young Women's. Oh yeah, Ike is supposed to call me. He calls me everyday. Today he wants to hang out with me but I have Young Women's. Then tomorrow I'm going shopping with my brother because he still owes me (my birthday was on Saturday so he owes me  REALLY  big). So I probably won't hang out with him for a while.  Bobby is supposed to call me on Wednesday or Thursday to hang out "hardcore". Eric wants to chill like "villains" sometime this week. Tasha is supposed to be calling Thursday or Friday to hang out because she just got here from Oregon. My mom wants me to go cleaning houses with her on Thursday. My whole week is going to be pretty busy. I was going to go to  Warped Tour  but I decided I don't want to go because I'm not going to spend $27.50 to see a couple of bands play. I guess this it for now. I shall be back tomorrow to post (at least I will try).
