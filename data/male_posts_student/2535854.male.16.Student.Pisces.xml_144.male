Ok my morning like started at 8:30am..I got up early as usual or had to a matter of fact..cause had to go like to the eye doctor..but not the regular one..  So ok Dr Tee like made recommended me to Tun Hussein Onn cause she couldnt find anything wrong with my eyes although shes not an eye specialist...  So went there at 9am..the 1st ever time you go its walk in and like those who have appointments which must mean the second time theyve been is like they get more priority...So had to register my name and bla and they had to make some file on me..And fortunately it didnt take that long but that wasnt the long part..  The long part was waiting!Omg what took so bloody long was when they were calling to check my glasses power...jeesh...they like give priority to those whove got appointments and they got called much later than I did!Omg was waiting for ages!Finaly they called me for something which in the end took like 10 minutes cause they also tested my eye and bla..  Then finally got to meet the doctor and after a series of questions and tests he said there was nothing wrong with my eyes and he said if I my problem repeats then I should see a neurosurgoen or a neurologist or something like that..Oh yeah my problem is that I seem to be getting headaches which seems to start throbbing and coming from behind my left eye..the doc said maybe its plaster( i think) headaches or migrains...I wonder..It doesn`t happen to often..maybe every  once or twice a week every like few weeks...Ive noticed that they happen on Thursday afternoon..at almost the same times..gosh..scary..wonder what could it be..  So then went back and slept a bit to get the pain away from my mouth cause I partly as well didnt take the pain killer :p ....  Then went out and had a haircut..it was actually longer originally but I wnated it shorter which im regretting a bit cause its kinda short although not to short although my hairs reminding me of Nizam`s hair..haha..Then went Mega optics my usual optical shop and like got a new pair of lens made for my glasses (used the same frame..yes those Guess frames that Kim Fui said to give him if I didnt wnat em :p..shows they are nice! and not cheap as well!)So ok im using my spare glasses or the ones I was using before I made the Guess pair which were originally a spare but then I realised rimless is nicer...oh yeah making new lenses cause theres like some cracks on the connections on em...so yeah need to get that done and then getting sunglasses baby!Getting these Killerloops which are like also under the same company as Ray-Ban..getting power for em and bla and mercury so you can`t see my eyes from the outside of em..Cool huh!?Its like an orange frame and the lenses are gonna be like err orangy or is it greyish?haha Ive forgotten...gotta power for em or else i`ll be blind with em!Ok then went TMC and got a truckload of stuff..  Ok didnt do much else but blog..  Oh yeah got some gathering invite from Raimie at KLGCC on the 9th which is this Wenesday I belive..  Ok thats all man..night night!I`ll shall write Fridays post after this or later whenever im free..laters..  Riz.
