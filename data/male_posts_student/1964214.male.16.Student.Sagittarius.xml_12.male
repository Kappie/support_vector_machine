We've graduated from our secondary schools and are now waiting for our O level results that should be coming out at the end of ths month. I really pray we'd do well and go to the same junior college. This way, i'd get to see her every single day. That would really be nice. For all you Christians out there who reads this post. Friend or fellow Christian, please do pray for us. We've been in different Secondary Schools and we don't want that to happen for our JC lives too. Also, it's valentines soon. You guys better get something for your Loved ones. And keep it a secret no matter what. Well, at least till the day itself. I made a mistake by hinting it to her the other day that it was in my bag at that point of time. I guess you all know the story by now, she searched, found it.. 2 weeks before she was supposed to.. well i was just glad she was happy with it. I'd love to stay on and yak about my life and how we met. But lets save that for another day. Enjoy your lives in Christ. Chiao..
