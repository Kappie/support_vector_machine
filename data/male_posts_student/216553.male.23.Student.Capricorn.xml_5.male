Also, Sophia hooked up a car for herself, Rajan and I!!  Finally, we won't have to worry about getting rides off people.  Hrm, what else is new around here?  Well, a fellow just left for back home the other day because he was starting to feel ill.  It's a shame though, he was the one who I came to the island with the first night here.  I guess that's life.  Anyhow, that's it for this brief update.  I gotta get back to everything from terminology, to neurobiology and anatomy.  Word of the day:  Achondroplasia - Decreased growth of cartilage in the growth plate of long bones resulting in dwarfism; a genetic disorder.
