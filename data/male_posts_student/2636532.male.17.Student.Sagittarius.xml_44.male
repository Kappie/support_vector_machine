You know...i've tried to keep this thing running, but sometimes people get reall busy, what with Rugby and work and homework that i get tons of in chem 30 that i have to do simply because if i don't i'll fail the whole course, and also i can partially blame the fact that i did just go to greece and italy and it's kinda hard to blog when i'm out of the country and the only computer i had access to and a greek operating system that i couldn't make heads or tails of. also I've yet to have a free weekend to myself, i actually spent my entire birthday which was last friday at school them working and then doing volunteer work, no cake no presents no party no nothing, not to metion that some of my family didn't even remeber til today that it was my birthday. Aye truly i've been busy. as for the message board, that's not my fault, i've gone over the code many a times and found nothing wrong, i've concidered going and using a different one but for that i'm just a bit too lazy.  -Matt
