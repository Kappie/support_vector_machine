Drum machines named Max don't stand up.  Real drummers sound better.  I'll get off my soapbox.  Oh by the way, the show at Alpine Valley was phenominal.  Don't believe me, take a look at this:  http://www.ateaseweb.com/live/2003/20030823.php  As good as it was, it doesn't compare to this show however:  http://www.ateaseweb.com/live/2001/20010801.php  Who knew a show that successful would pave the way for Shania Twain to play Chicago?  According to Greg Kot, it did.  Shameful.
