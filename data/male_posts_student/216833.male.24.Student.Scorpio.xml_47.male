I got up there around 9 and we started drinking at his apartment.  Went out on his balcony and talked and drank booze for about two hours.  We both decided we would walk over to fry street and visit a few pubs.  First we went to cool beans, had me a double bourban and coke and a shot of Jagermeister.  This was repeated several times through out the night, just at different places.  We left that bar and headed over to Muther's to find a pool table.  No dice, the place was full, James saw some people he knew so we talked with them for a while and left to go to Lucky Lou's - by this time, I am fucked up to no end.  I started calling people, I called nick, josh p. and tyler.  I couldn't really hear then, just shouted in the phone, the bar was loud.  We didn't stay there for to long before we went back up to cool beans.  Got another drink and a shot in me and we went up to roof deck to check out the band.  James had to bull shit the guys and say that I put out 7"s .  I can't even remember what the band sounded like, but they have my card.  Oh well.   We went back down stairs and boozed away, and started talking to random people, oh and fucking pedro was there.  He is from brazil and a totally awesome guy - I met him through Josh P. back a few years ago.  James told these chicks that I was in system of a down, they thought that was pretty funny, so they talked with us for a while.  I can't remeber what was said exactly, I just remeber talking about me getting married in a week and this was my lame ass bachlor party.  haha.  I had a good time - we finally made it back to his place, and I smoked a bit with his room mate ricky and we watched EnemyMine.  Fucking weird movie for sure.   I called mimi and said I was in no condition to drive - stayed up a few hours watching that movie.  James passed out and ricky went to his room so I was there, drunk, and freaking out over this movie.  I havn't done that in a long while and I paid for it the next day.    Sunday, I got home around 10am and just sat on my ass watching movies - pay it forward, proof of life, and some bigfoot show on the travel chanel.    This morning I got up at 7am and went to play some tennis with mimi - I was grumpy.  Been listening to alot of Nick Cave and the bad seeds and danzig!  M O T H E R!!!
