I really did have a lot of fun while in their company, I even remember laughing out loud with them which is something I hardly ever do.  But it was just a lot of work, and they really are not a healthy couple.    Initially I was really attracted to AA more than RN, see as I thought RN didn't like me at all.  But the more I got to know AA, his favoring fell more and more.  He likes to start shit and has a very childish side to him.  I don't trust him and put him in the same category as CK, someone I would rather just not know.  I find RN far more attractive, but than I wonder why he stays with AA.  I suppose the reason is that while most gay men are dicks, a majority are also wimpy, pathetic, whinny and far too passive.  AA is more assertive and a bit kinky, and in that respect more of a typical guy (i.e. heterosexual).  So on that level he is more attractive than most, only because most are rather lackluster.  But he is also controlling, crafty and unstable, the boy has issues.  He is not, and never will be, boyfriend material.  The antics he pulls sometimes with other boys I would never put up with in a relationship.  And that is why I have distanced myself from him, and by consequence them.  But I also thought that they broke up.  Anyway, JM called me as well.  I was hoping he was too embarrassed to ever take me up on my offer for a drink.  Lord knows that if I had ever abashed myself like that while under the influence, the last thing I would do is have drinks with the violated party.  And as conceited as this is, what makes him think that I would be interested?  I'm no top prize, but damn, I do try to take care of myself.  I have far more interesting hobbies than getting high, drinking, and hanging out with dykes.  I bet the boy hasn't read a book in ten years.  He is overweight, has bad skin, bad teeth and is victim to all those unflattering characteristics mention in the former paragraph.  And the worst thing, he's an unapologetic slob.  Years ago during my party days, I, along with other friends, went to his place to get high.  When we entered his room we had to push clothing (dirty and clean alike), magazines and other miscellaneous crap aside to sit on the floor.  It felt gross to be there, my skin crawled.  Then, after some tokes, he casually picked up one of the several 2 liter soda bottles off the floor, removed the cap, and took a swig of warm soda.  He was kind enough to offer everyone else a drink, but I politely declined.  I know I sound like a snob, so I guess I am.  But keep in mind those things don't bother me when the person is a friend.  However, when they try to push for more than a friendship, those unfavorable characteristics swirl in my mind making me dizzy to a point where I want to vomit.
