I thought it was gonna be very stupid and cheesy, but it was awesome. Me and Maryel were laughing through the whole thing but I don't think anyone else thought it was but it was fun. Oh yea and another plus is that the main guy in it sooooooo frickin hot I couldn't stand it. So I just wanted to recommend that movie to all of you. and i would see it again if anyone wants to go see it after Orlando. or we could see a different movie if you want cuz there are tons of good movies out there. and I really miss you guys so maybe we could all get together after Orlando and do something. I dunno.... just a thought. Love, Erica
