They won't(notice, I didn't say can't) see that they're skinny already, and eat a god damn sandwich.  They're skinny bitches who decide that they need to be even SKINNIER bitches, because for some reason, life has gone out of style.  Or, maybe they were overweight, went on a diet, and turned into a skinny bitch, and the cycle continues.  My stoopid health teacher decided that we needed to learn about skinny bitches, and it is then when I came up with this theory. We watched this movie showing a bunch of skinny bitches looking in the mirror, with a reporter asking them "what do you see?"  All the answers were the same- "A fat girl... I can't see my bottom rib while all my others are about to cut through, and my pelvic bone isnt protruding as dangerously as all my friends' are!"  These stupid parents keep thinking its a "phase" or some sort of disease, but it's just downright stupitidy.   If you call things "gay" when you really mean "stupid," go shut the fuck up and die.  And no, i'm not gay you fuckshits, I just know a bunch of them and i'm sick and tired of all you wifebeating prejudice assrapes not realizing how much of a big useless monkeycock you are and killing yourselves.  Why the fuck did people start doing this all the sudden? Some hick on a farm was taught that gays were stupid and somehow got admitted into Public Schooling.  Teacher: Who wants to color?  Class: Yay!  Little Billy-joe-bob-jimmy-bob-jim: Naaw, miss! That's gay!  Everyone: *GASP*  LBJBJBJ: Yeah! that's gay!  Class: *IQ drops 158 percent*  I think that's what happened. It's the only logical explanation to why how every kid in the world got retart-i-fyed.   On another topic, fuck you and your low carb diets. I'm sick of people telling me not to eat a burger because whole wheat bread is bad for you. Jesus, and I thought Vegitarians were bad. Now we're completely contradicting what we said was healthy less than a year ago! What the fuck?!  My mom, rather than eat the devil bread, now orders McDonalds' breakfast with JUST THE EGGS AND SAUSAGE, making a grease-o-rama. Its not like eating bread makes you the Blueberry girl from Willy Wonka. I fucking love peanutbutter sandwiches, and next time someone tells me about how great Atkins is, i'm gonna rip their throat out.  And don't test me- I'm really pissed off on this subject. I about killed my cousin(luckly there was a completely beat-up-able trashcan near me) for responding to my remark "it's hot in here" with the Nelly lyrics. I fucking hate Nelly and hope he dies a painful gunshot wound to the stomach.
