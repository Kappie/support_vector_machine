(yea, notice how the pple who want take photos are mostly female? and how they are mostly shorter? at least in this place called SING-A-PORE)  i dun get it......was watching episodes 19-22 of the OC yesterday....and they were going around exclaiming how being able to take photos wif your phone is the autograph of the new generation...errr.....it is? oh it is! is it really? maybe it is......convince me...  lemme try and recollect wat i wanted to post and post later..... ohyes, I'VE GOT MY MOJO BACK~!!!! yea baby~~
