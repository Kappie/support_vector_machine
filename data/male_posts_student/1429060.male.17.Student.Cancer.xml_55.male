You can find her blog to the right; 'tis the intellectual party link. Which actually leads to "Party in the Library". I shortened it to fit over there. My apologies, Miss Katherine, if thou art offended; tell me and I shall change it.  Another thing. Fuck you, Anonymous, whoever you are, who posts asinine and insensitive comments on other people's blogs.  That is all. Have a lovely evening.
