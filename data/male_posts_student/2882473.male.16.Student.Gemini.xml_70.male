I'm not feeling too bad about maths though, I've revised as much as I can (well, not really, but I think I understand it all) so I should be ok. But business... case study... and I haven't really revised for it. I'll probably do a little during the break between the 2 exams tomorrow. I say that now of course, but when the time comes, I never actually do. But then it's only business, and if I got a B at the end of it all, I would be perfectly happy. I may be slightly dissapointed with a C, but not overly. I'd get over it in about 20 seconds. So that's why business revision hasn't been high on my agenda. Or on my agenda at all. Actually, to be perfectly honest with you, I don't even have an agenda. I just revise when I feel like it, and whatever subject I can be bothered to do. So it only takes up about an hour per day, and that's only light revision. Anyway, I always blog about exams and stuff, so I really need a change of subject.  Earlier today, I re-discovered an old computer game 'Red Alert', which I haven't played for ages. It's not actually too bad, although Red Alert 2 is much better. Shame I don't have 'Generals' though, as that looks rather good. But it would probably make my computer have a heart attack (or something technically simmilar) if the CD was even put it. Well, at least that would finish it off, instead of it just frequently fainting, having memory loss, and tiredness (it does things slowly, it  must  be tired). I think I may look up those symtoms on the internet, and see what the problem is. One mo'....  Ok, my computer has...  urlLink Chronic Fatigue Syndrome  :s Hmmm... let's see... 'The first treatment most doctors recommend is a combination of rest, exercise, and a balanced diet' I could let my computer rest for a while, but I really would get extremely bored if I did that. Exercise? I can't really see how I could do that... use it more than I usually do. Maybe I could set it to do some large multiplications on the calculator. It often says 'this operation may take a while' when continuously pressing 'cube answer'. And a balanced diet... hmmm, I suppose I could just open programs I haven't opened for ages, or put in a variety of CDs - music, games and DVDs... Poor computer. If only euthanasia were legal...  In other news, I finished 'Harry Potter 3' this morning, finally. A rather good book. Now to start the next book. I wonder if I can finish it in just one week.  Well, not much else to say.  Bye bye for now.   Weather:  Hailing?!?! And rain. (Well, it' stopped now) Overcast most of day  Reading:  In between Harry Potter 3 and 4.  Listening to:  Starngely, nothing....  Watching:  The Paroll Officer last night. Great film.  Confused about:  Why I chose business studies  Annoyed with:  My computer  Mood:  Alright.
