Tyke took a group test in math and his team felt they did pretty danged well.  But ya never know with that whore as the teacher.  Grrr...Government today had some of the best clapping in a long time.  Kinker was honored with his Chili's Student Athlete of the Month award and boy did that ever give a good reason for applause.  His "stats" were pretty impressive so the applause was still deserving.  College baseball, that's not easy.  4th period was stupid.  That class is retarded.  But Tyke still does need to work pretty hard in there in order to bring his grade up.  His mom has now asked how he's doing in his classes at least twice in the last few weeks.  She even asked what he thinks he'll get for final grades (even though it's freaking quarter).  Tyke managed to change the topic by talking about the grad project so he is safe for now.  He doesn't exactly want to come home with under a 3.0 though.  So he should probably do a little work now.  Lunch at Subway was fantastic.  Absolutely fantastic.  Wow, just great.  Mmmm...mmmm.  Physics was pretty interesting today as well.  But it didn't taste good so Subway was obviously better.  After school Tyke has just cleaned up his house and semi-napped and watched an independent film on IFC.  Besides for that he has taken it easy (as if those activities weren't easy).  Oh yeah, Tyke had some good fajitas for dinner.  Nothing like good fajitas.  In less than an hour now Tyke is gonna go over to Purdy's and study for the Physics mid-term tomorrow with her and Haras and whoever else is coming.  So that should be at least fun if not learning-centric.  Or something like that.
