And me, Tom, Federico and Riccardo had a class-A, thorns-in-bare-feet, shockingly cold hose, screaming in the face of water pistols,  WATER FIGHT!  I apologise if I sound overly enthusiastic, but it's been so long since I really did something like that, sliding on a sheet, hiding in the orchard with a hose, ahh, all of it. *reminiscent sigh*.       And what better way to spend a sunny morning than with ButtercupNaomi? Naomi, Juli, me and Tom lounged in the beer gardens from like 10 am (I know! early birds an all that) onwards till Naomi had to go to work, I think. I stopped jumping for joy then, because I started  missing her already *smitten* . So I sent a text saying "I miss you," etc. Personal things which I shall not repeat cos she'll blush like purple ;) if/when she reads this. But it's true, I really did miss her like 20 mins after she left (  So  gonna earn some brownie points for saying this!).  ahh, girlfriends are so much trouble, nein?! lol. Anyway, enough from infatuated Sam already.      And now I'm gonna have to love you and leave you, cos I'm going to see Shrek 2 with Federico and Riccardo. Already seen it once, but mneh, who can turn down a film like that?!      Smiling Sam
