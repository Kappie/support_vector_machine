Things that I have found in the last 24 hours that are importantish + A device was recently patented that allows radio transmission using the human body as both a power source and an antenna. Cell phone companies are currently fighting for it. it is apparently Japanese in origin, but patented here anyway. I don't know, there is a gap there from what George said and what I've found so far on independent research. It is called the finger phone, and fits on your wrist. Its inventors name is Masaaki Fukumoto. I am not yet done researching this topic, and I do not yet have grounds for my suspicions, but expect a follow up on this story.  +Prediction completed- "LegoLand", in Windsor in the UK, has started a program of renting RFID wrist bands that can track kids any where in the park. It is important to note that this is not GPS strength stuff, but merely a network of passive readers placed in the park. Now, why doesn’t that make me feel better?  +Prediction complete- alright, truth be told I knew about this for several weeks from the drudge, but, I did not have this blog then, and it was on George yesterday, so I'll take my self served credit now. This month, after, in January of this year, scientists in the US made rats super strong by limiting their myostatin, a protein that limits muscle production, a "natural" mutation has been discovered in Germany tat allows a two year old to lift 3 times his body weight. Apparently there was also some research on this 7 years ago. What scares me is that this toddler’s mutation only "fully developed" late last month.  +Update on progress of RFID- there has been a universal production increase. Actually, truth is told, this news is a little late as well, however, I did only find out about it today. A supreme demand in nearly all types of RFID tech has caused many producers to go into the red in order to invest in more machines. This includes shadow soft, truth software and other very prominent production companies.  +NASA has announced a program to aid the private sector of space travel. This is either a very good thing, or maybe limited by controlling factors NASA may place on the companies that are their beneficiaries. The specifics have not yet been found, so expect a follow up.  Word of the day - maundering- to wander aimlessly, to speak with out purpose.  Quote of the day-the Columbus (Ohio) citizen (newspaper) "A study by three physicians shows that maybe as many as two out of three births in the US result from pregnancies."  Might add again later. Going to do more research now, then eat, maybe play a little gun bound, I think I have my double metal axe now.  +New prediction- Iraqi prisoners will begin to spout out tons of information as we release our newest toy on them. Perhaps new is the wrong word, as the pentagon released partially classified versions of the thing several months ago. As this is not a current thing, I will not go far into, but as I have not said anything about it as of yet and there maybe person interested in it, place in to google "active denial system" and see what comes up. time frame. Unsure, this the area I usually get wrong. My guess is this most likely to happen closer to election time. confidence=2. I only have this suspicion because of the multiple .gov sites I have found stressing it would not be used in torture.
