Just to remind you that Miss Becky goes to school at White Station Prison; she shares my pre-Calculus class, and has several of the same teachers I have. Her blog is at my right,  urlLink Broken Shadows . Just as a little reminder. She needs visitors.  Miss Heather - a fellow I met through Elise. Heather is a face that torments me constantly because I swear I have seen her before, but I just can't place her. Creepy stuff. She is a very lovely young lady, and I appreciate her muy much. And now,  urlLink Ladies and Gentlemen, Heather! .  Miss Rachel - she dropped by earlier to comment and I never credited her for that. Rachel also joins me at White Station Prison; she is in the AP Biology class and the pre-Calculus class, and also has several of the same teachers I have. You might have heard her name on Brock's blog. She posts her  urlLink Ramblings of a Very Lost Being .  Miss Katherine - I cannot provide Katherine's blog because, as far as I know, she doesn't have one. But Katherine also goes to the same hell I go to, and I know that she is a very pleasant person to be around. And she plays drums! Happiness. She is in the same "group", if you will, of rebellious teenagers that Brock, Alanna, and sir Kevin are a part of (you don't know Kevin. I don't know him well either. But he is also a nice fellow).  And now, to other subject matter... Which doesn't really exist.  It rains right now. Like it would in Scotland. Okay, I know that is getting repetitive, but I hate being in the warm, sunny South. I want dark, rainy Ireland. Or Scotland. And Katherine's mom teaches Gaelic! Very very positive. Maybe I can strike a deal with her. Puirt-a-Beul.  I actually remembered a dream last night for the first time in several months! It was wonderful, knowing that I actually dream (I think that Brock arranged it with the cosmos). And it was such a lovely dream too, but I won't go into detail, lest you be angered with my subconscious. But it really was a lovely dream, and a wonderful one to remember.  I must go kill myself with Biology. Cheers, mortals.
