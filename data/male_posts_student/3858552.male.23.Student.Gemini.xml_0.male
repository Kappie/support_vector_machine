It's like I'm swimmin' in an ocean of emotion, But still, somehow, slowly goin' numb inside. I don't like who I'm becomin', I know I've gotta do somethin', Before my life passes right by.   I want to cry like the rain, cry like the rain, An' shine like the sun on a beautiful mornin'. Sing to the heavens like a church bell ringin', Fight with the devil an' go down swingin'. Fly like a bird, roll like a stone, Love like I ain't afraid to be alone. Take everything that this world has to give: I wanna live.   Sometimes I wonder why I work so hard to guard my heart. Well, I hardly feel anything at all. I've spent my whole life buildin' up this ivory tower. Now that I'm in it, I keep wishin' it would fall. So I can feel the ground beneath me, really taste this air  I'm breathin',And know that I'm alive.   I want to cry like the rain, cry like the rain, An' shine like the sun on a beautiful mornin'. Sing to the heavens like a church bell ringin', Fight with the devil an' go down swingin'. Fly like a bird, roll like a stone, Love like I ain't afraid to be alone. Take everything that this world has to give: I wanna live,I wanna live.   Somethin' deep inside keeps sayin life is like a vapor: It's gone in just the twinklin' of an eye.  I want to cry like the rain, cry like the rain, An' shine like the sun on a beautiful mornin'. Sing to the heavens like a church bell ringin', Fight with the devil an' go down swingin'.  Fly like a bird, roll like a stone, Love like I ain't afraid to be alone. Take everything that this world has to give. I wanna take every breath I can get: I wanna live.
