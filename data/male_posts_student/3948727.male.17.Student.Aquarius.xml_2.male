I think that it was a very good gesture, considering all the criticism that Kobe takes for being selfish and only thinking about himself. All the players say that they're happy to play for the Lakers, but then again who wouldn't be with a franchise like the Lakers. They say they want to bring showtime back, we'll see about that. Meanwhilein other sports news, at the British Open Jonathan Byrd has the lead by 1 stroke, but guess who's hot on his trail, Tiger Woods of course. Tiger's only 4 strokesback from leader Jonathan Byrd. Now I am the one of the few people who says that Tiger is NOT in a slump. But....if Tiger doesn't win the Open I might just be proved wrong. It doesn't make sense to me really. I mean how can a man who's won so many titles at such an early age, and look like he's gonna break Jack's title record, all of a sudden just drop off from existence. I hate to say it but it all started when he got married. I'm not really trying to say anything but it's true. They do say that a women can be a big change in a man's life. I don't know though, maybe i'm just thinking to much of it. Maybe Tiger will win the Open and the next 4 tournaments after that. I know it sounds unlikely, but hey it is Tiger Woods we're talkin bout here. Well I guess we'll just have to see tomorrow after the final round. Hopefully Tiger will be holding the trophy high and laughing at all his adversaries who said he was on the "Slump". Let's just watch and see. Well thats all I have to report for today. Until I get more stuff to write on.
