This would be, according to the people quoted in the article, bad news for Democrats and Kerry-Edwards for two reasons -- Cheney's an easy target because of Haliburton and that sort of thing and because it would distract people from the DNC in a couple weeks.  I think the latter is more problematic, and the article sums up my opinion and thoughts fairly well:  “'Only dramatic events create dramatic opportunities to change these perceptions. Why? During dramatic events the public’s attention is fixated on nothing else but the event in question,' the memo says.   "A Cheney resignation would, it says, push Kerry and Edwards to the side. The news media coverage of who’d replace Cheney would be 'pervasive and overwhelming. With less than a week to the Democratic Convention, little attention is given to Senator Kerry’s policy and political agenda. The Democratic nominee is relegated to the second-tier of the news cycle.'"  As to the possible replacements, McCain would be somewhat dangerous -- he's generally well respected across party lines and he's competent.  Colin Powell could be, too, but I can't imagine him taking the VP position after the way he's been sandbagged by this administration over the last two years.  Almost every single time he came out and said something in response to anything, the administration came out and contradicted him.  The guy's on an island, and I can't believe he hasn't left yet.  [Don't ask about my title.  It sounded good when I first typed it, and I've got nothing better.]
