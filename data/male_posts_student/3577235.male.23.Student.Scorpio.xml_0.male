You don't need to get this.  since I myself could not decode the paragraph.  I don't know.  did not do anything.  I think I love her.  Too tired to think!  don't think no more.  You know in what year, I would like to imagine that I went to france and had lots of great sex with lots of beautiful girls!  those imagination was when I was in Taiwan.  Kind funny now!  Don't think so.  well, I can't wait.  But the fear caught up with me.  I look around.  I know one thing.  the Appearance really attract me, but as a whole, I like it.  Personalities really become everything.  I know that.  And I know what kind quality would I be attracted to!   Pictures, that's all I need!  I love to have those, although I also know I have nothing!  it's not just psychological, but in real!  man!  why the time.  what is inside of me is really not something I want to explore right now.  since there's nothing.  hopeless.  don't know why.  but I don't know.  maybe ther's something else.  but I just did not look.  on the sky, there's a bird.  a blue bird.  that have a black stripes at tips of each wings!  the while color and a dark blue is around the neck!  it's a blue jay.  Green land.  it's made up by the grass.   Sky is blue.  Nono is never here.  Seeing them successful, and watching myself falling into trap.  might just falling right now.  why cry out.  or did u cry?  scream?  or call for help.  my problems rely on myself to solve.  but how weak is me.  those chilling night.  it's terrible!  with the dark and only light poles in the parking lot.  why don't you yell for help.  but this is my qustion, dark, because I closed my eyes!  eyes wide shut!  irony?  no way.  but with a blue stripes on the tips of each wings.  we could still not fly.  Nono.  back in japan.  happy maybe ever after.  there would be tears, sweats, passion, and fun!  it's life.  no one can have with without those + pain.  but how you face it, how's your reaction toward it.  why?  but no?  too tired to think.  I don't really feel.  now I just found out that i am the one who needs to change along the whole thing.  I am the coleteroal damage here.  escape from it?  or make further damage?  I love her.  and should not die without saying it to her face.  but she is not here anymore.  then find other ones that you could say the samething to.  what are you going to attract other ones?  nothing.  I got nothing.  maybe that's something.   for whatit's worth.  plz don't sing.  singing is not your specialty.   the wonderous words are not flowing in my head.  since they are recently missing.  why should.  but neither.  whom would thought that I would think sher is beautiful.  but with that heart.  with that smile.  she is right where I want her.  but I know, I am not where I want her.  so where are you.  pizza is so good!  Maybe hakunamotata!  but who cares.  yoohu!  don't even try to underestimate yourself.  I know you are a coward right now.  but I am afraid  that the thoughts build up everyday, the wanting grow every now and then.  it's too dangerous!  what's on earth am I going to do about it!?  erect.  erect.  erect.  well, spayed it then.  I don't like to feel pain.  I still can take the pain emotionally.  there's no limit to those things.  anyway!  cuddle afterwards.  that sounds pretty.  I would like to have that too!  what 's the feeling to have your face dock in your beloved girl's chest?  why?  you want to try?  plz.  it's dangerous.  don't give your heart to imagination, which is going to tear them into pieces...  I could be shakebeer!  hahahah! banama.  hoopla.  aka, dododkee, .  204g4ji3jo4gk6g41u04t/65ku;4sk7ji3u,31j45 l24 is it long enough?  [ssssssss  yeah, I think so.   night night!
