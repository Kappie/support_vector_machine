I had to meet some kids with my freind, but they didn't exactly wanna talk with us to much.  I am not gonna worry though, because they are going to a diffrent school than me.  They seemed nice, but not interested in me and my freind to much.  We would talk and they would walk.  But it is alright in the end.
