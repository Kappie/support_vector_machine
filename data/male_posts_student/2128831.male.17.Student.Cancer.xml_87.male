It was boredom that brought us together and there was just this layer consist of a thick sense of transparency in between us. Neither can tolerate each other's way of thinking and neither can touch each other's life. We were so close in personality; too close. The friendship between me and her was so wholeheartedly treasured and so fearlessly fought. It was a mistake… a mistake I made by loving her so unbearingly and missing Lauren unintentionally... Her arrogance eagerly digested love and concern into simpler, breakable particles, where they gently dissolved and finally be eliminated… All I could have done for her, I tried and I failed. I believe the journey we were destined to walk together had come to an end. I don't need her footprints in my heart anymore… for I was given a brand new path to walk...  and together with Brett I will take this path! (BTW Brett is my new boi, he is great and all shiny!)  [Taking it in, try to be feminine]  My experience with casual dating truly boggles me. The fact being that somehow I am INCAPABLE of it. Add 1/3 honesty, 1/3 fear, and 1/3 bad timing and there you have it. It being me. Because I have no idea if it is pheromones or that unexplainable confidence, or a certain smell like someone else has been circling this territory - but I have been father fucking irresistible this past couple of weeks. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining about that part. No, in fact, I like that part a great deal. It is the fact that I am now left with envy for those people who can string along many people at once with no fear, and no thought of the others' feelings. I'm pissed now. I'm not talking about this anymore.  I am talking about this: I have it on good authority I'm about to be fired. Well, hot diggety damn! Why, you ask? Because I attend school in a building that is beyond unprofessional with their inner politics. It borders on the appearance of poop-throwing monkeys, if you ask me. It's just dumb stuff about someone needing to go down for something, and them picking me because THEY probably have it on good authority that I've been searching for a new learning anyway. So there. I'm not too worried about it.   I have no wisdom for you today. Are you mad? Sorry.  There I go. Dancing. That's beautiful, simply. I never really danced as much as this past fall. We go out to parties and we don't waste that time anymore. We don't just sit there. We don't just stand there. We dance. Dress up. Moving the legs to connect with the ground. Hands to touch the air. Shaking hips, shrugging shoulders. Touching other legs, slipping arms around waists, sexual electric energy, young, smiling, sticky sweet sweat, open facial expressions, important.   And that's what I guess I've learned the most about it. It's important, extremely, to dance. It's important to wake up and be sore in the stomach, the groin, the thighs, the triceps, face hurting from smiling. Going out and dancing teaches me about music, about the other people in the room, about all these tiny muscles in my body that make me so alive. These things are probably the most important thing, the most important metaphor for college here, or youth, or life, or whatever that I learned this past fall. And I'm so glad.
