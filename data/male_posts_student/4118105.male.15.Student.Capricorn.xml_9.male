If anyone wants to use any ideas, that's fine by me. That's why I'm sharing this. I couldn't finish it, but maybe someone else could.  Anyway, here it goes:  Section One: Exodus  Chapter One: Intro  This is the beginning, of course. The view of the soldiers, along with the Master Chief, are described. It is dusty and bleak. Many bodies are scattered along the flat plain, which was once a rolling hillside covered in a thick forest.  The marines trudge on, not knowing if they are the only survivors. Everyone but the Chief believes this was the Covenant's final strike, a trump card used because the battle had suddenly become tilted in favor of the humans.  Describe Manson, a haphazard marine with a cocky attitude and short fuse. He doesn't much like John, who is equally annoyed by the marine.  Many bodies are so badly mangled that it is impossible to differentiate  between alien and man.  Ends with the Chief allowing his men to set up camp. He tries to raise morale, but because he has the nagging feeling that the Covenant did not cause this, he has a hard time even keeping himself upright.  Chapter Two: Break  Zachary Channels is the only known marine who witnessed the incident without passing out before hand or dying. He tries clearing his mind, but as sleep takes him he begins to recall the horror.  Change to camp scene. John continually searches comm channels for any sign of survivors, but to no avail. Some soldiers sleep, others stare at the camp fire while playing cards over a supply pack. Manson is one of the poker players.  John almost gives up hope, but searches through the channels one more time.  Switch to dream sequence. Channels remembers the battle he had been involved in. He had been assigned as a sniper scout by a gruff sergeant.  He snipes at a Covenant brigade from the elevated base of a mountain. The mountain is pocketed with dozens of caves, and he finds one perfect for his use.  Taking out the top-ranking Elites, he causes chaos at the Covenant side. A new leader is chosen for them, and they continue marching.  Suddenly the sky begins darkening rapidly. Both the human and Covenant forces are bewildered. Channels watches as their bodies begin to be ripped apart by a sudden powerful force in the atmosphere.  He cries out as the sergeant almost reaches the safety of the mountain base in a Warthog. End scene when the sergeant explodes, his head knocking out Channels when it flies into him.  Back to camp scene. Chief continues searching comms.  Manson has begun to start a ruckus at the makeshift poker table. Chief ignores it at first, but after the marines begin to fight, he is frustrated.  Before he is able to stop them, he picks up a pre-recorded comm signal asking for assistance. It is badly garbled, but makes mention of an AI. With it, he is able to attain its point of origin. He tells the marines, they begin to clear camp, and the chapter ends.  Chapter Three: Remnants  Begin with a soldier trapped in darkness, unable to move.  The soldier slips in and out of consciousness, hearing a voice within his head. The voice warns that the battle has not yet started, and commands the soldier to survive.  Immediately, the soldier reaches his hand out and finds himself to be buried underground. Struggling to free himself, he almost gives up as he pushes with all his strength and finally breaks through.  Go to Channels. A soldier wakes him up. At first he is startled, but regains his sense quickly.  He is notified a signal has been picked up by the Spartan. The marines clear up camp.  Switch to John and his group. They are still wandering, heading towards the comm's origin. John himself is getting nervous because of the random blips on his motion radar. He also begins to think he is hearing things, but hopes it is only stress getting to him.  The marines seem to sense his anxiety, and are equally on edge.  Suddenly, John realizes they are being watched. He stops, and warns the marines to huddle together. They all know they don't have much ammo left, and any fight would most likely be futile.  Waiting for a moment, John listens intently. There is wind howling. A rustling sound.  Then a Jackal jumps out from behind a smoldering log, plasma firing. The startled marines begin firing away, despite John's yelling to stop. The Spartan then realizes just how exhausted these men must be, and he struggles to help one of them aim correctly to shoot the alien.  Just as the Chief is about to kill the alien, a swarm of green bolts fly into it from both sides.  In a shocking development, there is a rabble of Grunts that have formed around the marines, apparently confused and afraid. They whisper amongst themselves, and the marines' eyes dart nervously back and forth. Chief eases a bit, wondering if these aliens mean harm.  Dropping his gun, Chief slowly moves towards the aliens. They slink back, cowardly. Chief sees that they are too bewildered to attack.  Chief tries showing them he doesn't mean harm. The other marines don't trust the aliens for even a second. Normally, even John would be wary of these creatures, but this was not a normal situation.  The Grunts cautiously ease up to John, holding their weapons very anxiously. One of them walks up to him and touches his leg, then quickly darts away. Chief, knowing they wouldn't dare attack, does not let himself be bothered.  Finally, the aliens gather around the Spartan and admire his stature. He has a built-in translator, so he can tell they don't quite trust him. Still, he is able to pick out words that would seem to mean that they wanted to stay with the group.  The make mention of "The Twilight" and "Survivors". They seem to be amazed and rather pissed off that the humans are "The Survivors". They try explaining to Chief that the Prophets had taught that when the Twilight occured, only those that had joined the Covenant would survive. These humans were the first sign of life the Grunts had seen since then, meaning the Covenant religion was a lie.  Chief tries using a newly-installed human to Covenant translator, courtesy of Cortana, and he questions the aliens. Finding out that this was caused by a Halo installation did not surprise him.  He also finds out about "big scary things" that had attacked and scouted throughout a Covenant camp shortly before the incident, but does not know what it could mean.  Again, cryptic AI references. The Grunts will explain no more. They are still afraid.  Despite the marines' disputing, John allows the Grunts to trudge along with them. He knows that it might lead to more trouble in the end, but these creatures did not seem particularly bright or hostile.  As they continue on, John feels a growing emptiness within his mind. Hoping he is making the right choice, the chapter ends.  -----  Well, I'll try to finish up the storyline of the rest of section one tomorrow. There are two more sections, so it might take a few days to type them all up.
