Political activist, former Rage Against the Machine video director ("Sleep Now in the Fire"), and director of documentaries such as  Bowling for Columbine  and, his latest work,  Fahrenheit 9/11 .  I don't have a problem with the guy's attempt to reveal inadequacies in the government.  I just want him to follow through with it.  Case in point: David Letterman last week.  On the show, Moore practically apologized for his anti-Bush remarks he made at the Academy Awards.  That, and he laughed at everything he and/or Dave said.  I think he's high.  Or maybe he's replaced Tony Blair as President Bush's prison bitch.  If you're going to go anti-Bush, don't just stop your momentum.  I mean, when you have a movie criticizing the entire White House staff for what happened three years ago, you can't just say "What I did was wrong."  No.  Doesn't happen.  I think he's just trying to soften up his image in order to get more people to see the movie.  For one thing, though, I don't want to see Moore for two hours on a movie screen.  And I'm sure he's in the movie way more than he should be.  In short, Michael Moore's fifteen minutes of fame are way over.  He needs to work at McDonald's with that guy who made  Super Size Me .
