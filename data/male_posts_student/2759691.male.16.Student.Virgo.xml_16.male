However, recently released information indicates that the information the government based the hike on is years old. Surprisingly, this little detail was not mentioned when Tom Ridge announced the impending threat. The government made a big mistake here. If they would have announced that this information was not brand new, it would have helped calm the public fear of an attack. The alert was based on a treasure trove of information gathered after   urlLink  Pakistani forces arrested a key al-Qaida suspect   . But what's really weird is that the suspect, who was named as Muhammad Naeem Moor Khan by the U.S., was actually cooperating with Pakistani authorities to capture other al-Qaida militants. Looks like   urlLink  the Americans blew the cover of a Pakistani secret double agent    working undercover to catch the bad guys. What a shame. Maybe the U.S. intelligence needs to work more cooperatively with the Pakistanis.
