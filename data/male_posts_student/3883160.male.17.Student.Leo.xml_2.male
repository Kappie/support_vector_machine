I ended up getting a stuffy nose. It was very hot out, so that's why we went swimming in the first place. :( On Saturday, I had to go out to our farm to hay. I didn't feel very well, so I didn't have to hay that much. I had to work on Sunday, and it was super-busy. We had 322 come in to eat, and it wasn't even a holiday (which are usually very busy)! My friend's birthday was yesterday, and she had a party with her friends and family. She turned 21 yesterday! They had really good food there. They cooked hamburgers on the grill (yum!). She has a lot of kittys at her house, and she gave me one! The kitty that she gave me is yellow, and his name is Lucky. I'm going to take him out to the farm to live.      Big Brother 5:   Anyways, this was a big week for Big Brother 5! On Saturday, when I got back from the farm, I thought that I missed BB5! But, I didn't! However, I thought I did and I forgot that it was actually on at 8:00 on Saturdays. So, at 8:00, I was going through channels to see what was on, and BB5 was on! Luckily, I didn't miss the nomination ceremony. On the Thursday, July 15, episode, Mike was evicted. So, why was he the first to be evicted? It could be this. Mike was probablythe first houseguest to realize that Jase and Scott were huge threats in the household. Jase and Scott's alliance is practically controlling the household. Mike attempted to convince people to go after them, despite the fact that Jase and Scott WEREN'T on the chopping block... Mike himself was. I believe Mike actually convinced the household to be threatened by the Jase/Scott alliance, and the other houseguests probably believed that if they didn't vote Jase and Scott's way (which was to vote Mike out), they would be targeted by Jase and Scott to be the next evicted. This was probably Mike's downfall. After Mike's eviction, Marvin won Head of Household.      On Saturday's show, Jase and Scott talked with Marvin about who he should put up for eviction. They all agreed to put Lori up for eviction, since she decided to accept the $10,000 offered by the show in exchange for everyone living off peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for a week. They had originally planned to put Lori's best friend Karen up too, but Marvin decided to put Holly up with Lori instead. Marvin believed that Lori and Holly were the strongest players in the house.      It turns up that Adria does have a twin sister named Natalie. If they make it through half the game without the other houseguests catching on that they are two separate people playing the same person, they both get a chance to compete for the $500,000. The Power of Veto ceremony will be held on the Tuesday, July 20, episode of BB5.
