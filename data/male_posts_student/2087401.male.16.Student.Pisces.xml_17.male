The part I kept coming back to was a sleepover at our old house in that two-bunkbed configuration with the bridge.  I couldn't see anyone; only here their voices.  I know Jonah was there, I know Jessica was there, the third voice sounded kinda like Sarah but I wasn't sure, and the fourth voice I recognized but couldn't figured out who it was.      The other part I remember: I was in my underwhere and a cape with Shrek, and we were backup singers for Elton John.  Unfortunately, we didn't know the words to most of the songs, so we ended up making stuff up, until we decided just to "stand there and dance provocatively, which was weird.    Then Dr. Hodgins was back-stage waiting to come on, and someone was complaining to him about Turnabout being on the same day as something else.  Then Shrek and I parted ways and I went back to the sleepover thing.
