Nothing last's here. Moving on guess what i bought an uberly cool mesenger bag the other day for $10, and it's not one of those small one's it's actually one of htose big one's with lot's of space for everything, plus it's red and it was the last one i was so happy because ive always wanted messneger bags before but they are to expensive and stuff.
