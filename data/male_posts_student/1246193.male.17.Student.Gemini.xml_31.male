It is nice that Wal-Mart has everything you will probably ever need.  Unfortunately, the store is so freaking enormous that it is virtually impossible to go grab something quickly from Wal-Mart.  I go in there for one thing and by the time I get there, get what I need, get checked out, and arrive back home at least an hour has passed.  Which brings me to my next point.  Wal-Mart is not exactly in a convenient place for many people including myself.  It is on the other side of town, I know Taylorville isn't that big but I still don't like it.  There prices are low.  That's nice, for everyone except the people who used to own the small neighborhood stores.  Family stores are now non-existent because Wal-Mart ran them out of business.  I long for the times when no matter where in town you lived there was a store no more than two blocks away.  I find the past fascinating.  My grandparents tell me stories that I think are unbelievable, and they would be if they happened today.  For example, my grandma Jean used to go to the neighborhood bar everyday after school.  She would get out of school and go home.  She was given a small bucket by her mother and was sent down the street to fetch a pail of beer for her father.  I find especially funny considering this activity began when she was in fourth grade.  How would you react if you saw a fourth grader walking down the street with a bucket of beer?  I kind of got off on a tangent.  Anyway,  Wal-Mart's "convenience" is not so convenient.  Maybe you disagree with me, but I don't care!  Perhaps I will amuse you with some more family stories at another time but not right now.  Music festival rehearsal is tonight.  I would rather not go but I have no choice.  There is only one reason I look forward to music festival: The Battle Hymn of the Republic.  Specifically,  the part the high school choir sings. Really choir people, It gives me goosebumps every year.  I would love to be part of it, but I will never join choir and since that is the primary requirment...  Just one of those things I will forever regret and yet know that if I had been in choir I would have been miserable.    Is it possible to regret a regret?
