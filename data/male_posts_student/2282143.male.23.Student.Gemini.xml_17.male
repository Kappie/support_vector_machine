I have a bachelors degree from the University of Illinois in Molecular and Integrative Physiology and am currently on the quest to become a RN.  Still living at home doing odd jobs and trying to raise money for *ahem* more important things.  I'm 5'8" and weigh about 230 lbs (although I think its more muscle than anything...).  Blonde hair, green eyes, etc.  Two things keep me going:  my martial arts and her.  By her I mean the one person who can somehow draw reason from utter chaos.  Sometimes I trust her more than I trust myself.  She keeps my feet on the ground and I wish I could do the same for her.  Maybe I do, maybe I don't.  Needless to say, she does keep me going.  Anyways, to continue, I do love martial arts.  The human body is a wonderful thing, and I think the martial arts can display the beauty and power of the human body more than any sport I can think of.  Power, speed, agility, fluidity, coordination, reaction, and basically anything else you can think of are found in the martial arts.  Especially when you look at the broad range of styles.  I personally have done three:  Tae Kwon Do, Wushu, and Capoeira.  Tae Kwon Do is where I started it all, and where I came to love the things it stands for.  If you look at the five principles, you notice that not one of them is destructive.  Nowhere does it say to become stronger than your opponents or attack the innocent.  Its all about becoming a better person.  I can go much more into philosophy, but I will save that for another time.  Wushu is aesthetically beautiful.  To watch all the different forms is amazing, seeing the person move in ways that can only be described as watching a river flow.  Capoeira is a spectacle of human emotion.  Never in any group have I felt such ties to those around me.  As the mestres' said, "somos a familia" or "we are all family."  Its a dance, a game, a martial art, and a way of life.  So I'm outta here for now.  If something cool comes up at TKD tonight, then I will write later.
