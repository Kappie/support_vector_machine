Meanwhile, I've been considering tossing my current schedule out the window and graduating early.  Even though I wouldn't, because I couldn't survive and still be Marten.  I'd probably come out as, I dunno, martin or something.  Paul: somewhere around here are rules about title schemes, which you have suddenly followed by accident after stopping the book one, (Which is Erin's) and you have to keep the template in your post.  After the current one has been in use for a week, you can change it. look in the archives for rules I'm forgetting.  Meanwhile, the post ratio has gone a bit off for our most elusive members. Thomas has posted twice within a week, but where's Sophia?   Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.
