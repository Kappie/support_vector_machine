I played a round of golf on Sunday, shooting +13 with three pars, but having a terrible time chipping all day.  My driver was my best club, which is an odd statement; I hit four driver shots, and two resulted in pars, while the other two put me close enough to the green to chip over it and then back over it before getting it on the green to two-putt.  More golf this week.  And Corpus Christi!  First time to the beach since August.    Part of me wants to go to LA, get a job in the film industry, generate a sense of community with fledgling young filmmakers such as myself, and work my ass off with that internship and some job at Starbucks.  Another part of me wants to head up to Petaluma, get a job waiting tables or doing something menial, and spend a lot of time at the beach writing and living.  #2 sounds best.
