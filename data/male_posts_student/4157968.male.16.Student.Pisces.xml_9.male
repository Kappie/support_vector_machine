In the upcoming days/months/etc I will be posting on a semi-routine basis on topics such as: new clothes i may have purchased, the latest Red Sox quandry, how much the Yankees suck, Rick Santorum, John Kerry: The portrait of a dumbass, George Bush: The portrait of a dumber-though-should-still-be-our-president-ass, and anything else I feel like (because, well, I can!)... Hope you all enjoy, I know at some point i'm going to say something interesting on here.    - l8er
