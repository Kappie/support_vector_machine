He's decided this year that he won't be putting the lecture notes on-line, nor his powerpoint presentation. Fair enough I hear some of you saying. Yeah, all well and good I suppose. If ANYONE KNEW WHAT THE FUCK HE WAS ON ABOUT!! It's the lecture notes that allow people to draw a corellation between the readings and the lecture. It allows the students to compare notes they've done during the lecture, the powerpoint presentation/lecture notes from the lecturer, and information gleaned from the required readings. It's this process that develops understanding for the students.  Quality Teaching model.... Higher Order Thinking.... Pedagogy.... all these things, and others I can't remember,  everyone is having trouble with. I know I'm having trouble wrapping my head around it but that's probably because I can't afford to go out and spend almost $200 on some fucking textbooks that I'll use for 10 weeks and never use again. And you can't get them from the library because they're never there anyways!  If I could have a look at the lecture notes (even AFTER the lecture) I might have a better understanding but no, that ain't going to happen apparently. Oh, he's taken note of people's concerns and anger but that ain't going to persuade him. It's apparently so that we will actually do the reading (which I'd do if I could get my hands on a copy). Oh yeah, should I mention that the required text for this one subject, which is about $80, is written by him??  Yes, he is a world leader when it comes to the study of teaching and pedagogies and metalanguages and all that jargon. But just because someone KNOWS a shit load doesn't mean that they're good at getting their students to UNDERSTAND what they're trying to impart. His examples and explanations just leave us even MORE confused than when we came in. And the things that we do get a grasp of end up being COMMON SENSE THINGS ANYWAYS!!! Like making sure you don't set unrealistic expectations and goals for your students but still high enough to stretch them and furthering their education. He wraps it up in all this bullshit jargon when, really, he should SPEAK FUCKING ENGLISH!!!  Basically, he's one of those people who are so smart that they're stupid. Know what I mean? He's so intellectually advanced (in this context anyways) that he seems to forget that we really have no idea what he's going on about.  Anyways, that's me done for the evening. It's almost midnight and I got to be up in 5 hours to go to work so I'll finish off here.   Lowman X, out.    "I've got to be honest, I think you know, We're covered in lies and that's okay..."
