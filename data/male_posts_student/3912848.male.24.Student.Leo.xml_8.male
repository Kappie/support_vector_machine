I spent New Year's in Michigan, hanging out with all of the former Highlanders, except for J-Rock, who was snoozing away in Charelvoix.  Hung out in Yipsilanti, East Lansing, and Hillsdale.  I had a great time, folks.  After arriving home Monday to Brady, Ben and I took off for a little backpacking in the  urlLink Guadalupe Mountains  in West Texas.  We climbed  urlLink Guadalupe Peak , the highest point in Texas.  The climb is just over 3000 feet and guaranteed to reintroduce you to any long-lost leg muscles.    Ben and I then drove to the border and stayed the night in Presidio, TX, a small town on the Rio Grande where my uncle farms wheat.  Presidio is just across the river from  urlLink Ojinaga, Chihuahua Mexico .  We then drove East along the river to  urlLink Big Bend National Park , 800,000 acres of desert and mountain along the Rio Grande.  Did a little hiking along the Santa Elena Canyon.  Incredible.    We continued on to Rocksprings in the south west Texas Hill Country and hung out with a couple of cousins for a day or two, and then met up with our parents in San Antonio for the weekend.  I really love that city.  What a great state!  I'm back in Brady for a few days and then back to Austin.  All in all a terrific last two weeks.     View from Guadalupe Peak over El Capitan
