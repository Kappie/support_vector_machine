On arrival we began to rehearse more and more, and I discovered not only did I get to wear a suit jacket, but also wield a Samauri sword, wear a crown made of leaves and scream very loudly! What more could a humble drama student want?  Anyway, eventually exam time came and we put on a great performance. We got many more laughs than I had expected, which was all good. We had one mistake that was smoothed over not too badly, my northern character's comedic persona went down well, and with any luck we could be heading for A*s!  Well, you can hope...
