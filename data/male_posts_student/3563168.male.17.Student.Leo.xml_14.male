Honestly, what kind of idiot doesn't take offense in comments like these? Trust me, saying "no offense" doesn't get rid of any negative comments effects, and it sure doesn't soften the blow. Also, if the comment isn't offensive to begin with, then saying "no offense" is meaningless.  The Way People Think You'll React when they say "No offense, but..": "Man, I'm a dumbass. That sure was comical when you made an insult at me and/or made fun of me for one of my foibles. Did I mention I'm a dumbass? My hobbies include eating wood and having sex with knives."  The Way People Really React when somebody says to them "No offense, but..": "Screw you dickweed."  When you just joke and say "no offense", then it's ok, because people know saying "no offense" is stupid. When people really use it and think saying "no offense" will all of a sudden mean that insults won't piss people off, then they're just being dipshits.  If you like saying "no offense, but..." then do me a favor and don't forget to go to hell.
