But there were 2 boats out there giving off waves that were almost 6' tall from crest to trough. We would go flying off them and about poop ourselves afterwards. It was so sweet.  Then when we were almost out of gas I got a brilliant idea: Have Jordan go 50 mph by our docks, I would jump off into the water and swim to the dock. Yeah that was awesome. HUGE adrenaline rush. My pants about flew completely off my legs in the water...It was so awesome.  I had a great day :)
