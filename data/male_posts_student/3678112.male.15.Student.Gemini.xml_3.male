Show it your grandma and that’s your pocket money stopped for life. Yes, everything you’ve heard about Rockstars Manhunt is true. This game is sickeningly violent, and makes other blood lust driven games look like a picnic in the park with Barney the Purple Dinosaur. Come to think of it, Barney crossed with Manhunt. Now there’s a pleasant idea..   So what do we already know about Manhunt? Well for starters, unless your 18 you shouldn’t know that much about it. This is deffinently not one for the minors, and I must insist that anyone of a nervous disposition should stop reading now. In order to cover Manhunt properly ill be needing to describe some of the pretty horrific scenes witnessed in the game. Yes, Manhunt is strictly an 18 plus game and if I’m honest, is the one videogame I’ve ever played that truly does deserve the 18 certificate.   So, get the sick bags ready, turn off the lights and lock the door as we get to grips with the dirtiest, sickest game on the planet.
