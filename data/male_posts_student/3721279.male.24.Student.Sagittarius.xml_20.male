Did you know that the human body can survive on a daily dosage (approximately two to four shots) of espresso? I'm not sure if it's helping me regain control of my sleep cycle. Actually, to be honest, it's probably screwing me up even further. Yet, part of me doesn't really seem to care, and the girls at Seattle's Beast are so darn cute...(cough)...pleasant sometimes. Not having slept much in the last four days has made me realize a few things, none of them being the meaning of life, so please, ask your next question.  I'm too honest sometimes. Now half of you, of course, will say, "Oh no Dave, you have to be honest! You're a dying breed of male creature who believes in being truthful and open! Please never change!" (sobbing noises)   The other half of you are saying, "Well.....duh."  Identity is a valuable thing. Struggling with my own for the last few months has helped me confirm this, but within the last few days I've seen just how deeply people can dig to try and be someone else, or rather to be themselves when they feel like they're not allowed to be. Deceit will get you nowhere worth being. Did any of that make any sense? Yes? No? Good, 'nuff said.  The picnic/pool party/golf thing didn't go so bad. I saw some old friends, had some good conversation, and reserved my place in Hell by eating some of the most sinful dessert I have ever seen. Mmmm, wrath and brimstone. (rubbing tummy)  I am not going to make any comment about AVP.       (pause)       Wait, shit.  Thank you all for your comments on my last post. I'd been meaning to write for some time now, but for some reason I never felt as though I could muster up enough motivation to do so. I got on some kind of dumb kick, feeling like I had to have some kind of crazy advanced preparation to write anything of worth. Apparently, I only needed about 20 minutes. It felt good to just let my emotions pour out into words, and as soon as another light bulb turns on, I'll do it again! (rubbing hands together and laughing maniacally)  I'm going now. You can't stop me. No no, you in the back...sit down. I'll be back soon, I promise, but until next time, enjoy yourselves, and try not to get into too much trouble. See you all on the other side of the sun.
