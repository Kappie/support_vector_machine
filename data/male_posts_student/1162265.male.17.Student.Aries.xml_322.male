Before you were born, you were some molecules scattered all over the place, and had no mind. How is that time before life different then the time afterlife? To a larger extent, you've always existed, and always will exist, but a miniscule amount of that time is spent being alive as the person you currently are.   I can't think of anything non-philosophical.
