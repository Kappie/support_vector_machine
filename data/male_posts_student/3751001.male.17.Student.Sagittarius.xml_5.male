My only problem now is some stomach bug which is stopping me eat properly (i ate nothing one day!).  Anyways the week has been relatively boring except for a visit to town to see my online buddies Chris and Vix, i've met Chris before at riktards birthday party but i've only known Vix through talking on msn and i was shocked at how different she looked from her photo (its a good sort of difference).  Well everything turned out fine, both are really nice people and i can get along with them without effort. I didn't get round to buying anything, Chris has no money (poor guy) and Vix was splashing out on allsorts of CDs and DVDs (i think).  About two hours were spent talking on a bench, Chris left and me and Vix talked for a while again I could easily talk to her even without Chris's dominating presence.   Guys I love you both!  As for the site well things have been fairly ok, we've had a bit of activity but nothing worthy of mention (i'm not a millionaire yet!). I really need to learn PHP but its proving a nightmare, i've also been making lots of digital images with Adobe Photoshop 7.0. My photoshop work is availiable for viewing on my website;   urlLink http://www.atrocty.com/images  and some freinds work is in  urlLink http://www.atrocty.com/fanart   Well it's the summer holiday, over six weeks of boredom! I'm gonna be home alone for a few days while my mother and brother go on holiday to someplace i don't know about. Of course like any good honest teenager i will not be having wild parties, and getting pissed *rolls eyes* hehe.  Currently listening to :: Rasmus - Guilty Current mood :: Happier but not super happy, probably because of meeting my freinds. Quoteof the week :: "Bangin Blazin Squad" - Vix, taking the piss out of townie filth. Fed up with :: This illness, I want to eat!!!! Loving :: My freinds, i adore them. Currently in production :: Bon Jovi Vs Atrocity cartoon saga.  Oh well thats it for now!  ~Atrocity
