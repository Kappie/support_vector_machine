COME ON!   WE ARE THE SPARKMAN CONCERT CHOIR AND WE ARE STILL DOING CORNY MOVEMENTS!?!?!?!   im sorrry.  im rather moody.  and that was just really buggin me.  then there is this issue of friends... none of which i feel especially close to.  nows about the time for Dad to get transferred again.  yeah... 12 yrs in one place... its bout time to leave.  i dunno if i'd really miss anything.  there is nothin really to miss.  cept for maybe Ellen... oh and James cuz he's hilarious.  well i guess i'd miss the whole youth group at Church.. all 70 or so.  i love those kids.  anyways... i'm not movin so there's no use dreamin.  Tina and i have to go into school early tomorrow to make-up some quizes for Mrs Yarbrough's class.  i really dont feel like it.  im so ready to be out of that class.  oh man!  and we almost got to the part in Julius Caesar where I GET SOME LINES!  and we stopped for the day.  i was like man i wanted to be Octavius.... oh well.  maybe tomorrow.  oh and that part where they kill Cinna the poet cuz he has the same name as Cinna the traitor guy!  oh now  that  was funny!  anyways.  i think i should be off to make some dinner since im rather hungry.
