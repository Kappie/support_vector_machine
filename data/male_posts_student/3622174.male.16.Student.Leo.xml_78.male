That's what happened to me yesterday.  I was feeling fine until about 10:00 last night, and then all of a sudden, I just started feeling sick.  Turns out, I caught a stupid, spooty cold.  And its summer break, too, which makes it worse, because I hate being sick during my breaks.  Drivers Ed sucked today, having to go in there, sniffling.  During a test, people were getting annoyed.  I wish they'd get sick.  Just so they feel my pain.  Yes, that was mean, but, oh well.  Anyway, aside from them getting annoyed by me, drivers ed still sucked today.  The "you got thats" soared to a new level today, and every other word out of the teacher's mouth was "you," "got," or "that," normally in that particular order, within one second of each other.  I didn't bother counting, because I knew that it was well over 100 times that he said it.  Oh well.  Tomorrow is the last day of class, so, I'm not gonna let it get to me.  We're working on these project things, where we have to map out a 2000 mile trip.  Well, between me, Alex, and Caitlin, we managed to create about a 5,000 mile or so trip out to California.  Now I just have to type up the oral report, and we'll be all set.    Well, I need to go to sleep for about an hour before I type up that report.  Until next time, go bother someone else's blog.
