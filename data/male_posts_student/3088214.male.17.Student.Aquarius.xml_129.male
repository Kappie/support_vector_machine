I am convinced if Tristan and Thomas thought it was hard...it was...and the test score is based on averages.    After hearing what the essay prompts were...I am convinced you did great.  In any event...you are all amazing people and have grown as readers, writers, and students.  I hope you will some day appreciate all of your efforts.  I can't wait to finish the last month of school with you...let's stay positive and have a good ending to a great year.  You truly are an amazing group of school.  Clark
