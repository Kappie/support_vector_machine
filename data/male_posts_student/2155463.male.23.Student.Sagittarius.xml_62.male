Dang...well, instead of trying to narrate everything that's been goin on, here's a nice list :P  -  Installed a surround-sound system at my Grandma's (ok, so maybe it was actually Jay's) - did a very nice job, you can hardly see the wires going all over the place. For anyone in the area - movie night Friday? :) -  Finals week = three all-nighters in four nights.  I forgot how much this time of the year can mess up your sleep schedule; at least I have time to take naps in the afternoons.  Of course, the hard part has been the papers I've had to do - my Political Econ paper was a really butt-kicker, I had to pull TWO all nighters to finish it up (and it was only five pages long!  I just couldn't find a good perspective on it - I worked all night on it and then decided I didn't have anything worth turning in, so I worked another all-nighter on it the next day).  Fortunately my actual exams haven't been that bad, but I'm saying this before I take the Intro. to Conflict Management exam tomorrow... -  Money!  Got a $500 scholarship from WPNI and a $600 Pell Grant (allegedly - I haven't seen anything in writing yet).  I should be getting back my financial information from Kent really soon (like next week).  And a lot of people have been saying that they would be willing to help me out with certain things to get ready (one aunt has promised to help me get a suit - not that I particularly want to get one, but it's required :P).  I might yet be able to pull this off... -  Internship = finally finished up my essay (a case study - it was actually pretty hard) and sent it in.  Had my interview today (via phone); it was pretty tough, Chris (the internship coordinator) asked a couple of really hard questions (ex:  "You've been assigned to defend a man accused of sexually molesting a child.  You walk in to interview him and he blurts out that he did it.  Inasmuch as you still are required to defend him to the best of your abilities, could you continue to work on the case knowing this?"  or "You've been assigned to defend a man accused of killing his roommate.  The police have finished cataloging the crime scene and you go to investigate.  In the course of your investigation you pull back a curtain and find a knife with what looks like blood on it.  What do you do?"  You get the gist of the questions...).  Chris said he would get back to me by sometime next week, so with any luck I'll be all set up for my internship by this time next week :-D -  Washington = found out who my roommates will be and I'm pretty happy with the arrangement.  I've had classes with two of them (there's four of us in a suite) and they're  good guys; the other guy I've had a chance to talk with a couple of times and he seems like a good guy, too (plus, he's originally from inner-city D.C., so I might need to "buddy up" with him ;) -  Work = finally got to meet the woman who will be taking over for me.  Leilani seems really nice; from her resume and talking with her she seems very competent, but it could be a hectic couple of weeks inasmuch as we're only going to have about 3 weeks to get her up to speed and settled in before I'm gone.  And then there's the whole ISO thing comin up...we're finishing up our internal audit this week, and then we're going to have our Management Review on Saturday...looks like I'm probably gonna be working 50-60 hour weeks over "break" between getting Leilani ready and getting ready for the ISO audit on Jan. 13. -  Social = like I have a social life ;).  Although I was thinking about it...this is probably totally weird, but it struck me how much I miss saying "I'm sorry."  Seriously, I probably haven't had a situation where I could (or should) say it in a couple of months (I'm discounting perfunctory situations like accidentally bumping into someone, etc.); of course, I probably say this because I miss having relationships strong enough to allow me to put myself into a situation where the opportunity to say so exists, not because I miss the actual mecahnics of it.  Plus, there's just something restorative and definitive about responding to "I'm sorry" situations - the strength of a relationship is usually better described in how it responds to injury than in how it acts in health.  Of course, "healthy" and "relationships" are not usually words put into the same sentence with me - come to think of it, "relationships" isn't a word usually used in discussing me period. -  Girls = like I have a social life :P.  Nada, zippo, nil; get the point?  Ok, so maybe I have some "ideas," but I'm not planning on starting anything in the next month before I leave for Washington (Lisa, your suggestions was duly noted and is still being pondered ;).  If anyone has any ideas or references, feel free to contact me. -  Birthday = Yes, I am now even older than I was before (not that that wasn't the case yesterday or the day before that...but you know what I mean).  My rewards for turning 23?  Finally being able to file independently for FAFSA (not that it could re-file apply for next semester anyway) and getting kicked off my family's plan at LifeCenter.  But at least I had two e-cards waiting for me - one from WebShots.com and the other from Netscape.com.  I'm so glad that these corporations as so concerned with my happiness... -  Family = Talk about frustrating.  I'm so disappointed in my relationship with my family right now - I feel like a stranger whenever I go over there any more.  Not that I usually want to go over there - it's nice to be "home" and all, but it just always seems like I end up mediating a fight.  And my mom is being a real brat lately (or maybe I'm just becoming more aware of it)...sometimes I don't know how my dad puts up with it.  But I was thinking about it the other day, and I think she might be acting that way to get attention (basically, for the same reasons a little kid acts like that); of course, being "touchy-feely" isn't exactly a strength of my family.  Plus, I think that she might not be taking her meds...and she's been working a lot more lately (she got the job with LifeCenter).  And my perception of my dad has been totally shattered over the past year or so - I used to really look up to him in both a personal and spirital sense, but it seems like every time I'm home my mom is critisizing him, and there's only so much of that you can take before your perception of someone starts to get worn down (especially when some of the criticism is based upon objective facts).  That being said, we got to go out and play some racquetball the other day (I got spanked) - it felt really good to just be able to do somethin with him (not that we could actually do something just he and I - everyone else had to come, and I'm too "nice" to object - not that I knew everyone else was comin prior to them walking through the door).  And I just hate the "economic" mindset of things at home - everything is about money or something related to earning money (reputation, credentials, etc.) - I'm just not wired that way, there's other things more important to me than making money, and it just seems like I always get into arguments over my priorities, etc.  (I still don't think they know I'm a closet socialist :P).  Oh, and they could be moving in with my Grandma soon (it's about time, if you ask me)...they're going to try to rent out the house in Hudson.  But at least I'll be in Washington by then... -  Money (Part II) - I've only recently been realizing how much money actually impacts my thinking (and yes, I blame it on my parents) - I almost threw up the other day when it finally hit me how many of my decisions are purely motivated by economic considerations.  But at least I found it somewhat satisfying to realize that the decisions I've made NOT based upon economic considerations are the ones I'm happiest with...hmm, maybe I should take a cue from that? -  Metaphysics = Yes, time to venture into the weirdest parts of the weird world of Mike.  I finally got up the gumption (yes, that IS a word) to talk to Dave (the leader of my Sunday School class) about two of the primary questions I've been having, but I have to admit that he wasn't really much of a help.  I'm still struggling with my "Christianity Belief Equation" (i.e. God exists --> Jehovah is God --> Jesus is Jehovah), primarily in forming some way of believing the middle assertion (Jehovah is God) based upon some form of rational reasoning.  All I've gotten so far is "It's just something you just have faith in" (I HATE THAT ANSWER).  Of course, that segways into my second question - inasmuch as salvation is based upon faith and faith is based upon belief, wouldn't it make sense that salvation ceases to exist if belief ceases to be absolute?  Grr...sometimes I wonder why I wonder abou this stuff...I would describe myself as a person with a perpetually troubled spirit - "tranquility" and "certain" are not typically words associated with my spiritual state.  So anyway, the question about belief and salvation really troubles me - I've always believed in absolute salvation, but I just don't see how it can be the case if my equation holds true.  And with me questioning the middle principle of my "Christianity Belief Equation" (and thus the subsequent assertion based upon it), wouldn't that mean that I am in a state of non-salvation?  LOL...just another one of those inconsequential questions I wrestle with all the time...I need to take a cue froim my HS football coach and "STOP THINKING!!" for my own good ;)
