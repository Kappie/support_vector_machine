The light becomes that dull yellow, but everything seems wonderful. The wind begins to blow, and the sky darkens. I love this period right before the sky opens. I cant explain why but i just like to stand there watching the flashes of lightning miles away, and then let the rumble of the distant thunder roll over me like a crashing wave. Well, anyways, as i was standing there immensely enjoying this wonderful experience, a girl,  of  about my age, stood there doing the same thing. We both kind of stared at each other as the first droplets splashed on the ground. I dont know why, but it just seemed sort of kooky but awesome.   I picked up someseriously tasty tunes.... Pete Yorn The Fire Theft JohnnyGreenwood Ex Models DEVO Yo La Tengo Beastie Boys Joe Strummer Spoon Ben Harper and Herbie Hancock  i plan on livin this batch of music up for the next few days....and maybe make a mix or two!
