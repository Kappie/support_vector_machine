Ok… well not completely bizarre, because I had a hunch those sentiments were there… that she wouldn’t mind if I went out with this person. Also, I can’t say I’ve never ever thought of going out with this person. I think a dude would have to be gay or missing a testicle to not think she good looking. However, it was a long time ago that I even considered it. Also going out with a friend can be quite disastrous, especially when we have common friends. It’s not a simple matter of liking someone or having feelings, but there are far reaching implications. I should know… just take a peak in my blog archives for more info on that.   In less dramatic news... Alkaline Trio and One Man Army tonight at Canes. Going down there with GXG. This is gonna rock.  I'm not sure what my mood is. The whole little situation above has me feeling weird, but the show tonight has me feeling pumped.  ***
