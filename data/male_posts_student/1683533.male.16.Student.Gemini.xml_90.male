He is staying with us cause he is going through a divorce...but here's the really sweet part: he's been playing guitar since he was even younger than i started, and he has a whole collection of guitars.  Right now he has a Tacoma acoustic here, and it is a very rare one.  And the other day he just brought over a Regal acoustic.  It has a metal grill type thing where the hole on the acoustic would be, and then there are two metal holes near that, sorat looks like two very small metal speakers built in...it's hard to explain, but it has an amazing tone.  Also he brought his very first acoustic/electric 12 string with him.  It is an old Medallion, and he said if I could fix it up I could have it!  I just need to hook the pickup back on and change the strings.  It's only Tuesday, and I am swamped with homework.  We have a history test coming up and that is when we have to turn in our notes we did on the 2 to 3 chapters we covered....too bad nobody does the notes.  It's hilarious we all do the notes a day or two before they are due.  But it's gonna be hard cause I got a concert tomorrow.  Our first band concert...god...it's at a fucking mall....it's gonna be stupid....i really don't want to go...but i have to or else I will lose alot of points.   Thursday I think I will be over the stress I have from pre-history-test homework  cause that is when the test is, and that is when Just For You is gonna practice probably.  I was really bummed about not having practice today...I really look forward to Tuesday practices cause it keeps me happy throughout the week.  That's why I feel weary and weird today...I want this week to be over...X-mas vacation is soon...oh shit and I am going to my cousin's concert this Friday! it's gonna be sweet.  Well, that's what's been going on....I am gonna go work on my history notes...get a head start...and maybe study for biology...I really hate biology...well just the teacher...Richardson...she's such a bitch...her voice is unbarable, it's like nails on a chalkboard, and she repeats everything 1843021940295702 times, and the only people she likes are the stupid preppy pom pom whores, cause that's what she probably was in high school.  anyways, history now, cya  "why should I even try to tell you it will be alright?" -From Here On Out
