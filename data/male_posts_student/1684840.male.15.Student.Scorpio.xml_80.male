I've had to repay dad for I few things I've had in advance plus I went shopping yesterday and bought all of the Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 games.  So with £55 left, I plan to sell my Gameboy Advance and get an SP instead, which are 100 times better (I don't know why I didn't get one of them in the first place)
