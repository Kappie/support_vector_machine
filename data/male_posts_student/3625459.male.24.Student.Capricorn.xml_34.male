Aroo said thatthey were speaking about me ... prolly thinking that im living my life .lol @ living my life.   Angel gets a kitten that she loves only to have the kitten get stomped upon.  I dont know if i;ve lost Lisa's CD.I just wish i dont have anything to do with her. I miss C  more  than ever.  I try to forget the memory creeps in, one way or the other.  These little things that actually mean squat if you consider life as a whole .. but this is my life , my friends .. ppl i care about ... ppl who make me happy / sad. Must we be content with the things we get , even though we desire something thats equivalent but does provide us with happiness , even though it its just for a little while ?  Sometimes i dont know if there is a god, if everything that we do is already writtn down(predestiny), this whole concept of soulmates , why some ppl are stronger and more capeable of coping with situations , why some ppl are insecure and others insensitive to others and worst of all why do we love/care.   I guess its better for me to live in a society where you dont have emotions . i'll blend in very well.  Having thoughts about me living all alone and my sister being well off, thoughts like that i had penned down a good six years ago re-surfacing . No i wont go and ask them for help. whom can i ask for help . no one helps . well the ones who can , cant and the ones who wont , well they just wont help. Maybe i always find it easier to live in poverty,I never did have too many materialistic wants.   Times i wonder if im clinically depressed . Not enough happy chemicals in my head . Well like all things come to an end i beleive that my story will come to an end too.A  happy one or a sad one , i dont know .I sure hope it doesnt end up as a lonely one ... but then again , im so used to being alone .. it wouldnt matter.
