Enjoy!      P.S. Remember to check out the WORD at  urlLink www.crword.com !      *****************************************************************************************************************      THE BEST TV SHOW YOU'VE *NEVER* SEEN    OK...so in all fairness I should probably title this column "The Best TV Show You've PROBABLY Never Seen". After all, it is just possible that a FEW of you may have caught "Firefly" in its original run on the FOX Network. It aired there for all of three whole months in the Fall of 2002.  In a nutshell, the history of the show is this: FOX approached "Buffy The Vampire Slayer" creator, Joss Whedon, and asked him to create a TV show for them. He delivered on his end of the deal, with what is without a doubt one of the best science fiction series ever made; but FOX apparently had no clue what to do with it once they had it! More about that later...  My introduction to "Firefly" came courtesy of my good friend, Ian Eastman. He kept telling me about the DVD boxed-set of the series he had picked up at Media Play. I told him that I actually had heard a little bit about the program when it first launched. - I AM a major 'sci-fi' fan after all. However, I was firmly convinced that this would turn out to be just one more in a long series of potential dissapointments for Yours Truly. Thus, I had avoided "Firefly" like the plague.  It's been tough being a 'sci-fi geek' these last several years - at least in MY humble opinion. You have to realize that I grew up in the era when science fiction was just beginning to capture the imagination of the general public. "Star Wars" came out when I was 13 years old. At that time, you could catch reruns of the original "Star Trek" on TV all the time - usually paired up with another of my personal favorites, the classic "Space: 1999". Anybody remember that one?  The television schedules of the time were rapidly filling up with content like "The Incredible Hulk", "Wonder Woman", "Battlestar Galactica", "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century", "The Lathe Of Heaven", etc. The legendary British sci-fi show, "Doctor Who", had begun to crop up on PBS stations around the U.S. Douglas Adams' "Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy" books were climbing the bestseller lists. Ah...it was a great time to be alive!  Now as I see it, somewhere between the early 80's and today, science fiction - particularly on television - fell on hard times. As a prime example...here there was a brand new "Star Trek" series on TV in the late 1980's ("Star Trek: The Next Generation"), and I SHOULD have been ecstatic. Alas, I soon discovered that - whereas Captain Kirk and his crew would 'boldly go where no man had gone before', Captain Picard and HIS group would basically spend a lot of time sitting around in conference rooms discussing technobabble - or they might occasionally hang out in their local watering hole, 'Ten Forward', and chat about the mysteries of the Universe with Whoopi Goldberg. Yuck!  Again...whereas the original "Twilight Zone" of the early 1960's had captivated millions with its eerie, otherworldly stories, the various recent remakes of the show (1985, 2002) somehow decided that shock value and cheap thrills were the only way to stir modern-day viewers. So long brilliant writing and intelligent plots!  And don't even get me started about all of the garbage that the Sci-Fi Channel produces! Bleahh!  So, I assure that it was with AMAZEMENT that I discovered something decidedly different by popping in a DVD of "Firefly"! (Thanks again to Ian for the loaner!) It became immediately apparent that someone had finally decided to go 'back to the basics' that had made the classic sci-fi shows of my youth so appealing. Without even realizing it, with all of these OTHER recent programs, I had been missing that great sense of wonder and excitement that the 'classic' shows had featured to such great effect. On an even more basic level, I was thrilled to see that "Firefly" had stories that actually made sense, fantastic special effects that never threatened to overwhelm the action or sustitute for good writing, and characters you could really enjoy watching on a regular basis.  Now I know I'm going to step on a lot of toes here, but in my mind, "Firefly" is a more logical successor to the original "Star Trek" than any of the latter-day series that followed it ("The Next Generation", "Voyager", et al). Like "Trek", "Firefly" features a crew of fascinating characters exploring THEIR version of the 'final frontier' - and running into all kinds of exciting adventures. Like the original "Trek", the show gives you a feeling for what it it would be like to be aboard a spaceship out there in the vast darkness of space. Again, "Firefly" also occasionally tells a 'morality tale' - without ever being preachy. - And, yet again, it features a lot of humor - most of it derived from the interplay of the nine vastly-different crewmates aboard the spaceship 'Serenity'.  Without giving away TOO much of the plot, the basis of "Firefly" is this (as printed on the back of the DVD box): "Five hundred years in the future, there is a whole new frontier, and the crew of the Firefly-class spaceship, 'Serenity', is eager to stake a claim on the action. They'll take any job, legal or illegal, to keep fuel in the tanks and food on the table. But things get a bit more complicated after they take on a passenger wanted by the new totalitarian Alliance regime. Now they find themselves on the run, desperate to steer clear of Alliance ships and the flesh-eating Reavers who live on the fringes of space." - Sounds like pretty good stuff, eh?  Now I've got to admit that a couple of 'red flags' appeared immediately upon my first viewing of this series. First of all, I was afraid that being a Joss Whedon - or "Buffy" - fan would be prerequisite to liking this show. Fortunately, I was quickly proved to be wrong on that point! - I have never seen a single episode of "Buffy The Vampire Slayer", yet I love "Firefly"!  Secondly, I initially found the shooting style of the show - lots of hand-held, 'trendy' stuff - to be distracting. (I'm very much a traditionalist, I guess.) This eventually turned out to be not a problem at all - and, in fact, actually ADDS to the show's unique feel.  Thirdly, I was a little concerned about the weird mixture of science fiction and Western that "Firefly" seemed to offer. Right from the opening credits - with its very Western-sounding theme song (and shots of stampeding herds of cattle, no less!) - you know that you're not in for the TYPICAL sci-fi thriller!  Finally, I was afraid that the crew of the Serenity would turn out to be one of the most cliched bunch of characters I had ever seen assembled together in one place. - After all, there IS the requisite "no-nonsense girl soldier", the "cocky, renegade captain", the "tough guy who only looks out for Number One", and, YES - even the "prostitute with the heart of gold"! Amazingly, though, Joss Whedon and his writers turned each of these people into completely new and refreshing creations! They are each so individually fascinating, that even after watching all 14 episodes, it's still hard for me to pick a favorite!  It's neat, too, that they decided to go with a cast of (primarily) unknowns for this series. With the possible exceptions of Ron Glass ("Barney Miller") and Adam Baldwin ("Full Metal Jacket"), most of the nine regulars are really not 'known quantities'. Nathan Fillion does a particularly excellent job portraying the captain of this ragtag crew. His Captain Mal Reynolds is at turns irritating, noble, self-centered, heroic, narcissistic, brilliant, callous, and caring. Also exceptional is Mr. Baldwin as the aforementioned 'tough guy', who has the unfortunate first name of 'Jayne'. He is absolutely hilarious as the boorish, self-centered, not-always-so-bright 'man of action' aboard the Serenity.  ALL of the characters of "Firefly" are very full-blooded, not-always-predictable, 'real' people. They're a refreshing change of pace from the 'one-dimensional' characters of the various recent "Star Trek" series. It's so much more interesting to see characters who are conflicted - who sometimes have trouble doing the right thing (or even knowing what the right thing IS!) - than to see the cardboard-cutout heroes of "The Next Generation" who never break a sweat and who always live by the WWKD? (What Would Kirk Do?) Code.  Now if I've turned you off to the idea of watching "Firefly" by emphasizing that it's a science fiction program - I apologize! Don't be mislead! This show's roots are very similar to those of the original 1966 "Star Trek" series. Back then, "Star Trek" creator Gene Rodenberry sold NBC on the concept of a "Wagon Train to the stars". I doubt very much that Joss Whedon used those same words some 35 years later to promote "Firefly" - but he very well COULD have!  It's amazing to see how the futuristic technology of the show is deemphasized in favor of presenting interesting stories and people you can relate to. Now that's not to say that the show is boring or slow. Far from it! The action is pretty intense in most of the episodes! There are a couple of shows that had me LITERALLY on the edge of my seat! This is a great series for the 'action' fan. And if you're turned off by the idea of weird alien races, don't sweat it. - There are none! In fact, the 'Reavers' mentioned above are actually humans who've gone mad out in the lonely blackness of space.  So, at this point, you MUST be asking yourself, "wow, if this show was so great, why didn't it stay on the air longer?" Well, blame it on FOX, I guess. Once they had greenlighted the project, they basically proceeded to immediately run the program into the ground. First by insisting that Joss Whedon create a NEW pilot for the series. FOX apparently didn't like the 2-hour telemovie he had intended to start the show off with. They wanted more action and less exposition. As a result, "Firefly" went on the air in September of 2002 with a good - if vastly inferior - episode. "The Train Job" - while a very action-packed and reasonably interesting episode - unfortunately had very little background to set up the series in viewers' minds.  To add insult to injury, FOX decided to run "Firefly" episodes out-of-sequence. For a series that has a very nice continuity built into its storylines, this is tantamount to a 'mercy killing'. As a finalt insult to those who had stuck with the series through its initial run, FOX decided to wrap things up by airing the original 2-hour pilot as the LAST episode. Perhaps their reasoning was as follows: Now that the viewers have made the committment to stay with us for several months, let's torture them further by showing them the pivotal episode that explains all of the various main character's true motivations - stuff that would have been helpful to know from the 'git-go'!  I can almost guarantee that at this point, you're probably wondering, "well, so what? The show's dead and gone, right?" Wrong you are, my friends. Since its release on DVD last December, the show has - amazingly - taken off! Sales for the complete "Firefly" series - which includes ALL of the produced episodes (several of which never even aired) in their intended order - have been brisk. Brisk enough, in fact, to inspire the making of a brand new theatrical release - due in April of 2005!  That's right! "Serenity" is currently in production at Universal Studios and the new movie will feature ALL of the original stars of the TV show. It seems that you just can't keep good programming down! It's exciting to see that "Firefly" has now found the audience it so richly deserves. If you don't believe me, take a look at some of the customer reviews being posted on amazon.com for the "Firefly" boxed set!  In conclusion, I urge you to run - don't walk - to your nearest retail video outlet. You need to pick up a copy of this great series. It'll only set you back like $30 or so - not a bad price for around 14 hours of quality entertainment! In fact, I'm SO certain that you'll love this program that I'm hereby offering a money-back guarantee. If you purchase the "Firefly" boxed set and - after watching it - decide that you didn't THOROUGHLY enjoy it, I'll personally refund every penny that you spent on reading this column! (Good thing the WORD's a free newspaper and website! Hee hee!)  Seriously though...check out this great show before the movie hits. That way you can impress your friends and family by saying, "yep, I remember when this thing was just a TV show." Oh yeah, and when you DO head down to the store...tell 'em James Reed sent ya'! (Not that it will do you any GOOD - but it will definitely make you sound very hip!)
