You all know what it is, and you all know what it's about because you all know me. Read carefully.  "Pet" by A Perfect Circle  "Don't fret precious I'm here, step away from the window  Go back to sleep   Lay your head down child  I won't let the boogeyman come   Counting bodies like sheep  To the rhythm of the war drums   Pay no mind to the rabble  Pay no mind to the rabble   Head down, go to sleep  To the rhythm of the war drums   Pay no mind what other voices say  They don't care about you, like I do, like I do  Safe from pain and truth and choice and other poison devils,  See, they don't give a fuck about you, like I do.   Just stay with me, safe and ignorant,  Go back to sleep  Go back to sleep   Lay your head down child  I won't let the boogeyman come  Count the bodies like sheep  To the rhythm of the war drums   Pay no mind to the rabble  Pay no mind to the rabble   Head down, go to sleep to the rhythm of the war drums   I'll be the one to protect you from  Your enemies and all your demons   I'll be the one to protect you from  A will to survive and a voice of reason   I'll be the one to protect you from  Your enemies and your choices son  They're one in the same  I must isolate you  Isolate and save you from yourself   Swayin to the rhythm of the new world order and  Count the bodies like sheep to the rhythm of the war drum   The boogeymen are coming  The boogeymen are coming   Keep your head down, go to sleep, to the rhythm of a war drum   Stay with me  Safe and ignorant  Just stay with me  Hold you and protect you from the other one  The evil ones  Don't love you son,  Go back to sleep"  Analysis - Evil ones, boogeymen are people such as Morpheus, This is the Matrix and Agents talking in this song, or an actual father reaching out to his son hoping he'll stay and sway in this "new world order" with him, because no adult can exit the matrix without going mentally insane and dying. Whoever it is, he wants this child, to stay ignorant and stay within fate (matrix), away from choice (real world). Counting bodies like sheep, this pretty much means in the matrix, not literally but metaphorically speaking, dreams are of counting the humans instead of sheep, in the endless fields of vats. The window is an exit, the sleep is staying in the matrix. Pay no mind to the rabble (rumors of Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus). Protect you from yourself. = Stay away from your real body. A will to survive and a voice of reason. In Zion, your as good as dead and you don't have any say or reason in life, your liberty is poor, it's a shithole and you spend your entire life eating crap and fighting off sentinals as opposed to the matrix, you can become anything if it's your desire, any proffesion. But the question is, would you stay ignorant, oblivious of the truth and keep your fate and hault this so called evolution from one species to another? Or are you going to give your life to pain and suffering but have the ability of choice, fighting a war that one day will be one, for the future of humanity. Not them. Not them at all. You see. They can't last forever. They don't even live. They only exist. They need to be terminated. Send the Electricity Reaper. Save ourselves.
