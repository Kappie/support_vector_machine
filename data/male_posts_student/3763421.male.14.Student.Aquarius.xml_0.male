All of them wanted to watch Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (some of them had seen it already, they just wanted to see Emma Watson ¬_¬) while another friend and I headed off to watch Around the World in 80 Days. This is the first time I watched a Jackie Chan movie in theaters :P It was a nice movie. Some comedy and action touches here and there.  Our movie started and ended earlier than PoA. Afif (my friend who watched AtWi80D with me) wanted to try out the Xbox, so we headed off to a gaming shop nearby and paid RM4 for an hour of gaming. He played Ninja Gaiden. I tried it for a few minutes too. Nice graphics, and Hayabusa is good as a ninja. Around 6.00, PoA has finally ended. The group still haven't came out yet, so Afif and I headed to a comic shop where I bought two Penyiasat Remaja comics and an FFVIII wall-scroll (whee~). We moved on to another gaming shop where I bought Silent Hill 4: The Room, Onimusha Warlords, Onimusha 3: Demon Siege and Fatal Frame.  We headed back to the cinema and found the guys playing in the arcade ¬_¬ We walked around a bit till 7.45 then we went back home.  I spent my one month pocket money on this day T_T
