I sounded really evil at the end, and mumbled stuff off in Spanish, then slowly switched over to Swahili rambling.  I said something like Nataka Mbuzi, all evil sounding, and Obed started to laugh.  He was like "You want a goat?" That was pretty funny, because everyone else was like huh?  The other thing was about Buddhism, I guess most people don't realize that most religions preach the same thing practically.  I've seen that inner peace stuff in Hinduism, Gnosticism, Heremeticsm, even some in Qaballah....  Whatever, I'm to into weird stuff for my own good.  By the time I'm twenty I'll be into Aleister Crowley type of BS, and be able to summon angels by speaking Enochian or something weird like that.  All this weird stuff that exist....
