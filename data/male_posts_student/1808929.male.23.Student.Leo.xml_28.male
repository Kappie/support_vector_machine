In less than 48 hours I’ll be back at Duke for who knows what kind of spring break craziness. I bought my tickets a number of months ago back when it felt like spring break would never arrive. Now that I have to think about packing I’m not real sure why I’m going back. It’ll be a fun trip, of course, but it really doesn’t even feel like I’ve been away for a year. Why come back now? What is that all about?  Why is it that I always have to think of a reason why? Can’t I ever be spontaneous at all? So what if I feel like I’ve burned all the bridges behind me. Damn, this is what I hate about blog writing. What I end up writing is always so damn self-depricating. I think ideally I would like to remind myself of all the people and places who influenced who I am and where I am in my life now. While at Duke I had mentors, role models and a sense of direction (mostly in my last two years). Now I feel like I'm adrift once again, freshman-style.
