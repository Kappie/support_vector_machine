He is one of my best friends and as odd as this may seem I have never had a friend move away before.  Abe is tryin to get with Maria and good luck with that buddy.  Yesterday I was told that Claudie hated me.  I could understand y that would be because well thats not important.  However when I asked Claudie y she hate me she said she didnt. Now I am totally confused.  Another thing that confused me was that she said I was good looking.  She didnt say this as if she wanted to go out with me but that didnt matter.  The thing was I would like to think she is telling me the truth but no one has ever said that to me in my entire life.  Shit not even me.  I hope she doesnt hate me because I want to stay friends.  Now to get to my recurring theme.  Well I am a nice guy and nice guys finish last.  I think that this is bogus but it seems to be true.  I went out with Sarah that blew up.  I asked Liz out that blew up.  I liked Claudie she didnt like me.  Abe tried to set me up with Sheila that didnt work.  Well thats pretty much all I have to say  >>
