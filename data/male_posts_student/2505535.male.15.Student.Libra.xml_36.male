Tuesday Charl (who is atm on holiday) and Kathleen came round, that was fun, played alot of Mario Party 4 - which I won, but it was a good game, the gap beween us all on the leader board was very close, except for Charlotte who sucked =P. Then there was Tai Chi as normal, which was good.  Then there was wednesday, that was fun, played alot of C Generals, w0o, and sometime in the afternoon Charm and Jen came round, we drank tea and debated Asylum Seekers, that was interesting, and the tea was nice, Jen didn't drink her's, she said it was "hot nothing" pah.  Today - booked tickets to Mark's play, which is tomorrow, we went all the way down to the theatre with Matt at 11am, well, it was a 5 min walk, so not that impressive. Then after me and Dave went to Croydon and saw Gothika with Alice, we randomly bumped into Alex on our way to the train station, we're all to buy tickets. Jen and Charm were going to see Gothika aswell, but couldn't cos they spent all their money the night before getting pissed with some guy we only know as Alan, but it was worth it apparently, so that's nice.  Before I forget, Helen came back from Germany today with everyone else who went to Germany. She specifically asked me to edit this post and mention it, so here I am, adding a whole new paragraph just to say this. Apparently her partner for the exchange was a retard. Social retard.  Oh, and a few days ago this bus driver let me and Dave on for free cos we were twins, weird, no?
