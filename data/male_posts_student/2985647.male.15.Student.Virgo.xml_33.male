Finally the evening comes and Little Johnny  and his mum go off to the big top. Little Johnny sits there and enjoys the  lions and the tigers and the jugglers and the trapeze artists, and finally  out comes little Johnnys favourites, the clowns.  Johnny is loving the clowns and their humorous japes until one of the clowns  comes up to him and says 'Little boy are you the front end of an ass?'  'No,' replies little Johnny. 'Are you the rear end of an ass?' 'No,' replies little Johnny again. 'In that case,' says the clown, 'you must be no end of an ass.'  Little Johnny is distraught and he runs out of the circus and all the way  home in tears. When his mum catches up with him she says, 'Little Johnny  don't worry, your Uncle Marvo, the master of lightning wit, backchat and  repartee, is coming to stay tomorrow. We will take him to the circus and he  will sort that nasty clown out.' At this news little Johnny cheers up and  looks forward to the next night.  The next night comes and, sure enough, Uncle Marvo, the master of lightning  wit, backchat and repartee arrives and the three of them set off for the  circus. When they get there Little Johnny, his mum and Uncle Marvo, the  master of lightning wit, backchat and repartee, sit down and enjoy the  lions, the tigers, the jugglers and the trapeze artists, and then out come  the clowns.  Again Little Johnny is enjoying their antics and yet again one of the clowns  comes up to him and says, 'Little boy are you the front end of an ass?'  Quick as a flash, Uncle Marvo, the master of lightning wit, backchat and  repartee jumps up and shouts at the very top of his voice:  'Fuck off you Red nosed Twat!'
