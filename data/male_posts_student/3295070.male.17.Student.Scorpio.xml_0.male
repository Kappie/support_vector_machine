I know i havent posted in like a month . . . . but what can ya do? I've been busy, stop hassling me.      So quite a bit has happened since I last posted . . . but most of the shit is mundayne and insignificant, so i wont bother you with the boring play by play of the last while . . . .       So on friday here at school they brought the drug dogs in, luckily I dont do that type of thing, and had no reason to fear getting busted, but some of my friends did! it was kinda funny because one of my friends had some hooch, and another just had a pipe and some rolling papers, and they got the EXACT same punishment. The interesting part of that is that drug paraphernalia* sp is not against the rules in our school, or in the legal system here where I live . . . . i find it a little odd that the two guys would get the same punishment when one didnt even break any rules. Fuckin' arbitrary bullshit, I think that i can get my friend's suspension repealed, but he doesnt want me to . . . . i just feel as if students get no respect, and they discriminate against us because of out age.      During the drug search, the teachers dont even get searched! I know the odds are slim that a teacher would bring their stash to the school, but its still a possibility! they are discriminating against us like were second class trash! I feel like a black man in the 30's, SOLIDARITY! we might fight the power, fight the POWER THAT BE! quoted from the great NWA.      Im just sick of all the injustice that I have to live with in today's society, All this infrastructure is finally starting to get to me, I just need to be free of all the limitations that hold me down.      Well i just got into a big theological conversation here with a couple guys in my science class, and i dont have much more time to finish this, so im gonna end this here and now, and i'll post something else later on, later guys.       -The Slut
