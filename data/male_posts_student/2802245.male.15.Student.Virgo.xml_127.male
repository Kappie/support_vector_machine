Anyway, didn't get that much time on the computer today, so I decided to make some buttons for the site instead of my usual project, they look okay to me, but will probably need refining for the particular colour scheme of the site.  I'll send them to Jamie, and he can decide what to do with them.     James   ,  urlLink Black Ghost Staff
