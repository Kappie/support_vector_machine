We stirred up the embers of the barbeque and sacrificed the bat handle and the bat.   urlLink     As any good Bush Tucker Man knows, the secret of a splendid fire is to start up a Rolf Harris tribute band. The generous billowing of the wibble board, and the cascading gusts of the Didgeridoo, allow for a fantastic fire!!  Can you guess what it is yet ?    urlLink     But this wasn't doing the job. Where there is smoke,  WE NEED FIRE ! Dave was summonsed to the garage to ' bring the lighter fluid '.    urlLink     As the flames began to grow we watched our signatures, signed at the beginning of this momentous occasion, begin to fade. The heat grew and the flames became towering furnaces of evil!    urlLink     The immense joy of being at one with natures most vicious tool soon turned to fear that we had actually set fire to Dan  Raynor's wooden pagoda. There was only one way to fight this potential for devastation, and that was to fight fire with fire! (well, more lighter fluid anyway!)    urlLink     After the towering inferno had begun to die down there was a fear that, as the bat was made of such quality timber (finest Peruvian balsa, so I'm led to believe), the heat would not sufficiently destroy the beast. Cue  Handy Andy , always ready for action with his power saw. He soon set about wounding the sturdy length, while admirably still finding time to keep drinking his beer!    urlLink     Disaster almost struck! In the excitement of decimating the bat, Dan sought to satisfy his hunger by eating one of the sausages from the barbeque. " No Dan, that's no sausage, that's a flaming bat handle! " We cried. Catastrophe averted, we set about crushing the ashen timber.    urlLink     The ashes were set upon by a pair of insatiable, devouring tongs. Although heartbreaking to do, it was a job that had to be done in order to allow us to bottle the sacred ashes.    urlLink     The careful funneling of the ashes into a Stella bottle ensured that we now had an ashen chalice, ready to be presented to next years winner of the  Annual Sudbrooke Ball Game Gala!  The world waits with baited breath!
