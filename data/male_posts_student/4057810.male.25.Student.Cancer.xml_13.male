One change is that there is that I've put up a fuller profile of myself.  It occurred to me while browsing through other people's weblogs, that it's hard to get a sense of where the author is coming from without knowing even some basic information about them.  I don't expect an autobiography, but knowing things like what area of the world they're in or what kind of job they have helps to place entries in some kind of context.  I've also blatently ripped off  urlLink former Star Trek: The Next Generation actor Wil Wheaton's weblog 's sidebar current interests list, so that you can see what I'm up to, though I can't really imagine why you'd be interested :P  Following my overly verbose links section, you'll find a  urlLink Creative Commons  license.  I debated whether it was worth squeezing it in between the Blogger station identification and hit counter, but ultimately I decided that I ought to.  On the one hand, I thought to myself "what, you think your entries are so wonderful that people are going to rip them off?", and on the other...well, I really hate it when people do rip stuff off my pages without asking.  It happened a couple time before, usually with pictures, and in each instance, the person hadn't asked for permission to use the photos, nor had they bothered to save the photo to their own server; they just linked directly to my page.  I didn't find that very classy.    One last thing I'd like to do is get rid of is that advertisement at the top of my page.  Obviously that's something that won't happen so long as I'm on the Blogger system, so there may be one final move that will put this weblog on the  urlLink individual web space  that the  urlLink University of Toronto  provides to all their students.  It's only available to me so long as I'm a student, but seeing as how I've got three more years of undergraduate studies, possibly followed by graduate school, it's a pretty long term solution.    [addendum, 3:52PM]  One other change I've made is to switch my hit counter service to a move reputable provider and also happens to offer statistics as well as the basic counter, just for my own curiosity.  I've also moved the counter to the bottom of the page, since it's placement on the side bar looked messy, because it was centered instead of offset to the left.
