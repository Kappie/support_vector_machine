Then we smoked a bit. We sat around for a while, and then I decided to go home. Before I left though, we went into this hilarious chatroom on Soulseek - I need to download Soulseek now. So I took the bus and now i'm here. Dad comes home in probably an hour or an hour and a half and he'll make a barbeque. I'm probably going to smoke some during the day tomorrow. Oh yeah, and it's still impossible to conceal my bald spot. Fuck you barber- fuck you all the way to the bank. I'm never getting my hair cut by him again. Oh yeah, and Sam is in the kitchen so I can't get any food. Because he'll ask me stupid questions.   Stupid bastard
