I will link to a page that I find amusing, or boredom stopping or funny etc. I accidentaly found this site. I suppose I could add the links to the left side bar, but I'm not going to. I think that would make the bar to crowded eventually.  I am in search of some more journals to read. I think that I will make a search for them later.  Tomorrow Dominique is coming over after church, so I don't think I will be writing in the journal, or even being online, until after 7. Sorry, but tomorrow is to important to me to waste time on the computer. The only way I will be online is if she decides to turn on my computer. I don't know if she will or not though. If she's reading this now, she probably will.  Wow, I just realized I was ranting. Gotta stop that. Let's see, something interesting, something interesting...nope, I got nothing. I suppose I could tell you what happened yesterday during school.  Math: I decided to stop reffering to my math class as "Geometry". It takes too much effort for me to type "Geometry" correctly. My math teacher changed the positioning of the desks, so we got to chose new seats. Doesn't make much difference to me, I'm not sitting next to anybody (thankfully; during school, I am very socially inept; on purpose that is). I asked him if we could just sit anywhere. Mr. Lewin said: "Anywhere that looks good." I was just about to sit on the floor when he said to sit at a desk. Some teachers suck out all of the fun of being so literal.  Between math  english we had a rally. Rally's at my school are great. They aren't mandatory. I dropped my backpack off at my english class and my teacher tried to get me to go to the rally. Yea right, like I would go to the rally. He told me that his water-polo team was doing a strip-tease. All the more reason why I shouldn't go. Like I really want to waste a half-hour of my time watching a strip-tease. I'm sorry, I am not one of those perverted guys who actually wants to see that crap. I sat and talked with Liam, Lenny and Danny. Lenny actually admitted that he almost went to the rally. Only because there are soda machines near the big gym.  English: Well, all we did was read for like an hour and a half. I almost fell asleep. We are reading a book that is such a low reading level. It's a really easy read, and I estimate it would take me less than a day to finish it. I don't like the way my english teacher talks to us. He pretty much talks to us on what he thinks is "Our terms". Well, that is true for about 80 percent of the class, but the other 20 percent doesn't talk like that. Sara suggested that I asked one of the dumb preps around me. I agree.  Lunch: If it weren't for lunch, yesterday probably would have sucked. Actually, even with lunch, yesterday sucked. I don't enjoy B-Days (periods 5, 6, 7 and 8) only because I have math and biology the same day. Again, we pretty much talked about random things. Sometimes I wonder how many times you have to repeat somethings until you get it into their heads. Actually, that has no relevance to lunch, I just wonder.  Free Period (7): Well, since I have nothing to do, I decided to help my Biology teacher until 1:40 when class started. It actually worked, the time went by fast enough. When you have a free period, an hour and a half seems like a long time. Well, even when you don't it does, mostly because you are probably in class.   Biology: Last period of the day. We had to do a lab involving the temperature of water which fish were in, and how many times they had to breath if you altered the temperature. Our group had to fake it, since the stupid fish wouldn't sit still. I think we might have messed up, because one time I was counting with another person, and I got 100 times and he got 130 times. I think one of us can't count, and knowing my math abilities, it's probably me.  Well, that was a dreadful waste of 24 hours. I think I am going to go wander around. Oh yea, Dominique told me about this cool AIMbot called "smarterchild". Add "smarterchild" (without quotation marks) to your AIM buddy list and say hello. It's pretty awesome. He can tell you what time it is in other countries. Heh, that's what I thought was cool, there is plenty more than just that though. This is agent 11; signing off.
