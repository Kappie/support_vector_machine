I cant go home coz i got training in the evening. Nobody was there 2 accompany me. These couple of hours i began to think of you again. You seems so far but i wish tt u were wif me.wentwalking ard TM and then went back to sch again. So  urlLink sianz! @_@ Training  starts and i started jogging while watching the soccer match going on at the same time. 2dae's IVP soccer match is TP vs SP.  This is an overview of the match : In the first half, TP dominated the game. At around 35th minute, a cross from the right side falls perfectly onto a TP's striker direction. He seized the opportunity and volleys the ball to the back of the net.  GOAL!!  TP took the lead. In the second half, TP's players were lacking in fitness but they still tried to attack quite a number of times. Sp's goalkeeper performed well in the second half. He managed to perform some great saves and refused to let TP increase the lead. At ard 75th minute, a mistake from a TP's defender in the penalty box gave SP a penalty kick. SP's striker no.9 slammed it home.  GOAL!!  SP equalised. TP's goalkeeper was disappointed. He dived the right direction but yet did not managed to keep his clean sheet.  Final Score : 1-1
