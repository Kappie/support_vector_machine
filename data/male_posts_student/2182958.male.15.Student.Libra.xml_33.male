Spiderman has to be the best superhero movie and movies ever. Better than Batman, better than Meteorman, better than The Increidble Hulk, X-Men, ANYTHING, SPIDERMAN BEATS THEM ALL OUT. Everything was so well put together, so well thought and planned out.    The relationships between characters left me guessing about the next "situation." The tension between Peter and Mary Jane left me asking questions till the end. The characters were so real, it was as if they weren't acting at all. Especially Doctor Octopus, he did so well of a job at acting that it was like he wasn't acting at all...like that's who he really is. AND THE ACTION, the action was so well animated and even though we all know it was all computer generated it still was a great use of computer animation..they did a VERY good job at mixing real fighting scenes with animated ones. The action was so real, I felt like I was flying around with Spiderman, and at some scenes they would have first person views of the action and it made me feel like I was there. The movie gave "me wrinkles and it makes my rump shake" to quote Eagles of Death Metal. But overall, if you were to see any action movie this year, Spiderman 2 IS that movie.   Like the first Spiderman, Spiderman 2 leaves a large hole in the plot....that will be filled in Spiderman 3. Like other movies, the Spiderman movies leave great start ups for the next movie.  Thank god for Spiderman, a sure save from movies like "White Chicks."   urlLink     I love these movies.
