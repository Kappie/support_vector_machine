Alex is speaking pseudo german. I think it's kind of funny. Turns out the chap who's windows XP wouldn't install didn't do so cause the disk was scratched. Chalk one up to I told you so.  I miss Frankenputer. I'm going to play some Diablo on it when I'm at home.  Wirelessly.   Fuck yeah.  That is all for now.
