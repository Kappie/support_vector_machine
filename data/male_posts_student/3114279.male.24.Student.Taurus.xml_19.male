      Yo yo yo, this is Glenn, lazoid supreme. I have now entered my mid 20s. 24. The beginning of the prologue of the introduction to the pre-end. I feel kind of old. True, I am only in my early-mid-twenties, but next year I'll be in my mid-mid-twenties, and before I know it I'll be in my early-late-twenties. Aging is a scientific bitch. Classes have again started. The people in my classes are still whiney retards, but I only have to put up with them in one class this semester, so it shouldn't be too bad. The songs I have started for my summer project are beginning to take shape, and I am very happy about that. Moving this weekend also, a definite plus since my roommate caught a prostitute having sex on our porch the other night. Oh, I wish that was a joke. If I post more often, maybe it would be less uninteresting events in my life and more humorous observations. Hm. So the last week of class a bunch of scientific geniuses started circulating emails complaining about our chemistry professor, and how it was his fault they were failing, and blah blah blah. One guy responded by saying the whole system of chemistry was at fault, but students aren't powerless, and our voices can change how it is taught, and how the textbooks are written, etc. Here is the email I sent him in return.    Hmm. You raise an interesting point. But then again, perhaps it's not the  book or the professor. Perhaps it's chemistry itself! We, the students of  FSU, should unite together to change the science of chemistry! After all,  with all of these fancy equations, and numberamas, and thingamabobs, it gets mighty peculiar. Why, if we just changed it so it was much simpler, we'd have all gotten much better grades! What's the point for all them high-falootin' elements up there on that brainy-brained e-lem-ental tabular? We only need about ten of those. When you gonna see cesium in the real world? Matter o' fact, when you gonna see electrons in the real world? Never. Electrons ain't a gonna git me a brand new porsche, no siree bob. Chemistry should be a one-two buckle my shoe science. Just addition and subtraction. What do you get when you put hydrochloric acid with ammonium hydroxide? Simple. Hydrochloricacidammoniumhydroxide. One and one is two. Ain't no blip nor blap bout it. So what say you, fellow students? We gotta git this ball a rollin, otherwise it'll be football season and we won't have no time 'tall.    Man, I hate my classmates.  In a story of typical Glennluck, I was walking to pay my tuition today when a malfunctioning sprinkler turned on next to me and directly sprayed me with water. I'm not talking a little bit of sub-stream, but a full on geyser. It was a really hot day out, so I didn't care that much.
