Strangely, my PC has decided to use its onboard speaker to bleep at me occasionally, which is most annoying. I have speakers and a Â£80 headset, stupid!  Well tomorrow I'm off to Birmingham University for an open day there, which means I'll have to get up at 6am tomorrow so we can drive there. Damn you, expensive trains! Anyway, I'm looking forward to it and I think it's going to be a worthwhile trip.  Now I must depart for the land of 40 winks (also an interesting game coincidentally) otherwise I fear that 6am will hit me even harder in the face tomorrow. I apoligise for the lack of content in this post, but I'm not really up to writing much this evening. Good night!
