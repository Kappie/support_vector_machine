Mika and I didn't go on any rides, so we ended up meeting up with Emma, Emma, Tara and Ella. I shouted Tara a ride on the Alpine Express, so it wasn't too bad. Tara thought she was gonna be sick, but she wasn't so it's all good.  The thing is, I was getting  really  close to Mika and stuff. And I enjoyed it! Maybe I'm turning straight... *shock!*!  A few days ago Mika told me she got knocked up by Steve, and her period is late, by, err... six days now. Shit. Anyway, she's gonna buy a test on the weekend, and if she is preggers she wants to get an abortion. She said she doesn't have enough money for one so I'm contributing to the "If-Mika-is-pregnant-get-her-an-abortion Fund". Which I'm happy to do, because Mika rocks my world.  Um. I had a few other things to write about, but I forget what I was going to say. Meh!  I'm soooo totally pissed of with German. Totally!  In Chemistry I flicked Karmann on the side of the face. She's having a hatey on me now. Soooo not cool!  Oh, and my computer broke. That explains the shortage of updates. I should be getting an upgrade, so it could be all good. I think I lost all my music, though. All 4 days worth: 1750 or so songs. Meh!   Right now I'm posting from Dad's work laptop. It's really cool!   3GHz P4  256mb RAM  40gb HDD  EXCELLENT screen   Dad say's I'm inheriting it when I go to Uni. Not too bad a hand-me-down, I say!  Trevor won Big Brother 4, and became a millionaire. Then proposed to his wife. He accepted -- what a surprise! He's rich, famous, and um... yeh. You would've accepted too!
