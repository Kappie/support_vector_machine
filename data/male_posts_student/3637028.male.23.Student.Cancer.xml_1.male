After looking around at it I decided to use this to my advantage and make my own damn webpage.  And here it is! I didn't want to go too flashy, because it's not me and I don't know how.  Posts won't be much more than a thought I may have had that day or news about me.  Hence the name of the page: Krap.   For today there isn't much.  I'm wasting time because I'm supposed to be writing a short essay for my English class this summer and cleaning my room so a realtor can start showing my house to potential parties.  What no one knows yet though is that I'm part of the deal:  You buy the house, you get a tenant that lives in your basement, pays no rent, and eats your food.
