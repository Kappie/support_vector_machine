I think not. My theory is that God is up there reading the blogs. You just say whats going on and if he thinks he wants to help, he does.  Hmmm.  What does God do in his spare time?  He knows everything that has ever happened and ever will happen.  To Him time could go by at an infinite speed. He wouldn't be able to watch t.v., He would what was going to happen.  I wonder if He gets bored.  Maybe God has a blog!  Our task is to find it.  Hey God, if you are out there I would appreciate your address.  I want to read your blog.  Everyone keep your eyes peeled, it may be out there.  That is a disgusting saying if you think about it.  Peel your eyes! Who would want to peel their eyes? I don't even know how you would go about doing something like that.  Wow. Hey, everybody needs to check out Where is Raed?  It is being written by someone that is in Baghdad. Not an ally but a citizen of Iraq.  It is kind of freaky, but fascinating.    Salam pax
