Oh, it's a big fat barrel of complaints!  Let's open it!  Well, the first thing that made my trip sort of un-fun was my body's intolerance of any physical activity.  As a lot of people know, DC and NY are places where the main mode of transportation is walking, and where I live (NC), that is not the case.  Therefore, I had quite a time venturing throughout our vacation destinations, and I am lucky that I had a little pile of tissues in my pocket at all times which I used to mop up the sweat on my forehead every four seconds.  Maybe I lost some weight.  The next thing to make my vacation not meet my (already low) expectations was my step-dad.  Heh, I've never liked him since the beginning anyway.  He is pretty much an immature high-schooler's mind inside a 56-year-old's body.  I only wish I could be as easily entertained by farts and burps as is he.  And in addition to the Make-Stupid-Immature-Jokes section of a high-schooler's mind, he also comes complete with the Bully section.  We were eating breakfast at some cruddy bagel shop in Silver Spring, MD and I got up to go to the bathroom, but while getting up, I accidentally knocked the table a little bit.  It didn't fall over or even move that much; it just sort of jumped a bit.  However, my step-dad chose to display his awe-inspiring maturity by stating the following to me:  "Boy, you'd better be glad you didn't do that, or you'd have had a lot of fight on your hands."  I don't know what you guys think, but if I were eligible for the Senior Citizen's Discount at Golden Corral, I wouldn't go around challenging teenagers to fights.  Another incident with Step-Daddy occurred when we were about to take a bus tour through Brooklyn.  One of his favorite sayings is, "Nip it in the butt," so when we had a slight difficulty locating the right bus, he decided to nip several consecutive butts by skipping everyone in line in order to find the bus driver.  He started some type of hysterical dance and was querying the driver as to whether or not the bus was the correct one, and the driver politely replied that it was indeed the right one.  Well, Father-Of-Stairs kept on dancing and started yelling at my mom, who was in the back of the line at the time waiting patiently, to come to the front with him.  The driver of the bus asked him to calm down and relax, but Step kept on telling my mom to come to the front, and this cycle continued until she finally came.  I was at the front of the line with him while all this was happening, and I, unlike him, recognized the fellow human beings standing behind us.  I turned around and apologized to them a few times, and they all said it was okay, and everything calmed down, and we had an enjoyable tour with a great tour guide.  However, for the rest of the trip, Daddy-Step ranted about how he was just about to give that guy a "five-knuckle sandwich" and whatever else he could think of that had a twenty-year-old, worn-out, unfunny joke in it.  And the thing that makes me mad is the fact that he knows he probably wasn't going to do anything, and two things would have happened if he had tried something:  1.) He would have gotten himself and all of us thrown off the tour, which was quite expensive by the way, and 2.) He would have gotten the smack-down from the bus driver, who looked a lot more physically-fit than Step-Dad.  All of this just shows what a bully he is, and I really don't like that.  There are several other things wrong with him, but I won't continue because I know that I am certainly not perfect, and I have no right to complain about him.  Also, I always end up feeling badly for him after I have gotten over my angry spurts because I know that he is old and he is just trying to hang onto his youth, however little he may have left of it.  Even though it may sound like I hate him, I don't like to actually get angry at him because I am really a nice person and I don't want him to feel like the rest of us (me, my mom, and my brother) are ganging up on him.  I am in quite a hard spot here.  I guess if he ever does anything else really terrible, I can write about it here, and that will make me feel better.  Until then, I'll leave him alone.  Golly, I'm sorry people.  There's nothing interesting in this post.  I guess it's just because I'm trying to straighten everything out that's happened over the past week.  Stay in touch, though, because I'm planning on posting some pictures from the trip.  Thanks for your time and dedication to my blog.
