He has the same type of facial features and hair, minus the big cheeks.  Don't believe me?  Look at this.     The ones on the left are me, and the ones on the right are John Mayer. Keep in mind there are very few pictures of me, so I couldn't find me in the positions that he's in, but it's close enough.  This leads me to only one conclusion: since he's a girl magnet and heart throb, then I can only assume that I am gorgeous as well. I already knew this, but it proves it.  So, next time you're a girl and you want to be on my gorgeous body, then keep in mind that it's just like being with John Mayer, which will make me even more attractive. Man, I'm hot.
