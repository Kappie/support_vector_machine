Well I had a really busy day today, my dad wanted to tear this room out that used to be part of our garage, so his garage would be big again....Went from like 9:30 AM to 4PM, I'm really tired, but o well. Anyway I got to hit you with this Link to one of the hottest underground artists there is:  urlLink FoKissed  (Pronounced Focoused) His music is AWESOME...I guess if you can compare his style to Eminem's but he is definately bringing alot of uniqueness to the table. Check him out! You gotta hear this guy too,  urlLink 5150    So not much goin on tonight, Im about to fall asleep just sittin here....Later Im probly gonna try to jump out my window and smoke a bowl in this alluminum foil pipe I made....I really wanted to do it during the day so I could see, but I guess I'll do it blind, and hope I dont spill anything and lose sh*t...and I gotta hope no one comes in my room when Im out there and they realize Im not here, ya know. Then I guess I'm gonna try to write some more tonight...  Anyway, gotta go. Keep it Real -HaZe-
