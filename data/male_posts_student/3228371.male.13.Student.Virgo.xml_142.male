He says that he thinks Harry might die in the last book! Nooo! *sniff sniffzZ* But he's so cool! Haha! To be honest, I think Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) is better looking than Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter). Of course, I don't like it when Felton gels back his hair in the movie but he looks a lot better in the other pictures I've looked at it. Hehe ^^  *sighzZ* So bored. Not letting the [apple], [pear], and [red] problem get to me. [Pear] can think whatever [pear] wants... I don't give a shit anymore. Psht. Screw it.  What else is there...? Hmm, talked to Brian and Martin today about some stuff... I think I've decided something. Gotta find the right timing though ^^~! Haha! It was so funny during Science class with Brian, Martin L, and Martin Y! We played a game similar to Spin-The-Bottle. We spin the waterbottle and whoever it points to, the person who spun the bottle gets to ask that person a question and the person has to answer truthfully! Muahahaha! It was really funny! ^^ Those guys are so weird.  Something seemed to be bothering my alien today but he didn't say anything so blah. Hope that nothing really is wrong.  Well, that's it for now... blog later maybe
