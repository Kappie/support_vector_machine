OK, well this blog has been ignored and abused more than a couple of white trash kids in a trailor park!  So, its up to me to make and stand, take action, stir up the masses, and pave the road for change.  Can I get a witness?    Anyway, what's been happenin'....hmmm...Oh!  Well, here's a sad thought.  Our summer vacation as we know it is slowly dwindling before our very eyes (or eye in my case!)...It's awful isn't it?  Should be considered a crime, honestly.  But yeah, sadly, summer is comin' to a close and we can reminisce and bitch about how our summer isn't long enough.  Hah, the only reason summer didn't seem long was cuz you didn't get off yer lazy ass, get out there, and do somethin'!  Get up and do somethin' dammit!  Don't bitch...stop bitching...stop bitching!  OK, well you get a little sympathy from me...You know, as much as I  LOVE  school, I can't bare to let go of my late nights perusing the Internet for random things...Nights staring up and watchin' the night sky, wakin' up whenever I wanted to...havin' the ability to just sit there and do nothin'...Yeah, I'm gonna miss it, but hey, its  Junior Year  guys!  Don't worry, I'm gonna make sure it kicks fuckin' ass!  Just cuz summer's over doesn't mean life's over!  Hey, ho!  Let's go!  Plus, I can say, for one, that this summer has indeed been eventful and crazy...and I have people who can second that!  Hmm, whats up on the  World Wide Web  right now?  No one seems to be online at all...its kinda disappointing.  I thought at least that I'd get a glimpse of  Elyse  or maybe hear the classic  "door open"  sound when a buddy signs on and see  Josh D's   screen name with an asterisk next to it...but no...heh no one is on, or available...not even my  "pen pals" .  And no,  "pen pals"  does not refer to my friends like  Elyse  and  Josh D , if you catch my drift...If you didn't catch my drift, well...maybe you'll find out sooner or later.  Anyway, I'm outta blog ideas for the minute...**** really takes it outta ya, doesn't it guys?  Well, stay tuned, I might just blog again!
