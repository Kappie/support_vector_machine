I have taken the time off to grieve and get things done regarding my Dad, but now it's time for me to take my life back and get back to some sort of routine, but not a rut.  The stress of the day is having to move out of the place I'm currently living.  My roommate is desperately trying to scrounge up money to keep his house.  I feel really bad for him because he let me live here for cheap so I could go to school.  His finances got out of control and I can only help so much financially.  I'm hoping he can pull it off, but not only are the land people after us, but his parents also are nagging him for their loan to him.  I don't like his parents, they treat him badly, and try to "change" him with their religious Bible thumping.  Now they are making him sell his home with no place to go at this point, but that makes two of us.  Last week his Mom gave me a five day to vacate notice, which is not legal, but that's the kind of person she is and she knows that my Dad died and everything.  I have religous family, but they are loving, not hateful.  Even if he can somehow pull off keeping his house, I will be leaving because my time here as run its course.  I'm tired of his parents, the financial strain, and my lack of independance this causes.  I don't know where I go or where I'll come up with the finances, but I'll probably put stuff in storage and then stay on my friends Joe and David's couch for a short time while I figure things out.  Dale's just got off the phone with his parents, and I better go find out the latest.
