I'll have to spend mad to get the right system, and I assume manufacture drum and bass through another system to match the drum and bass in the song I'm mixing from.  Lots of work for giggles.  But what are hobbies if you can't kill yourself over them.    What I'm kind of writing on now -   Fantasy story about our war in Iraq and other places Three Strikes script - redraft Mobsters and Opera short script - redraft Debate comedy - outline  And that's just stuff touched in the last week.  Goal - wake up early enough to write an hour each morning while here.  Ha!
