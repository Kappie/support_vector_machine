The media industry is all about the fear of the spectacular and the reactions to it.   Indeed there are terrorists and there is tainted beef, but the probability of me dying on a hijacked plane or getting some bad beef is not that high.  I think the whole Michael Jackson scandal is another example.  Let's be honest, he's a freak. His child molestation case brings in the spectacularity of celebrity, but at the same time deals with real human fears of freaks hurting children. Fear of falling from grace. Fear of betrayal. He was someone that grew up with millions of people watching and people adored him. However, his continuous weird behavior worries and intrigues the public. He's a familiar person who's life is falling apart infront of us. His story is like that of a Greek tragedy. With the media industry magnifying every detail of the story, what's going on with Michael Jackson is blown up to conflate the real and unreal.  These are just some ramblings.  **
