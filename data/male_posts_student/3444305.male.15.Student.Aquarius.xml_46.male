We played a game and got chocloate and then after school I got a ride home from Tara and then just kinda hung out. Then I rode around with Kyle and went to Nacy's and Kmart, where my great CD labels were still in place from the last time i went, and Walmart where I bought a chocloate milk, but then I spilled it on my kacki shorts, so I wasn't very happy about that. Then we went back to Kyles and just watched some TV and I played Snake II on his cell phone and just listened to music, then I had to go home so I rode home and then just did nothing, then my dad got home and I waited him to cook dinner but I was starving. By then I had a start of a headache so I took some medicane and then just hoped it to go away. But my dad finally cooked dinner, he cooked chicken but there was no barbcue sause, so I just had cooked chicken which isn't my favorite, and then he made this pasta that I hate and only him and my brother like. So I just had the chicken and the rolls, so waiting for dinner was pointless. Then after that, I went down and tried to get my project for APS done which was due the next day, but then Natelie called and told me to go up to the swim meet so I went there and watched Amanda swim, but then I had to come home and do my project again. Then at 8:00 Summerland was on and I haven't watched it for about two weeks so I had to watch it. Braiden lost his virginity in this episode. Great episode lol. But then I had to get back to my project and was doing it during the commericals, and then at 9:00 I was almost done with my project and kinda worked on it while I watched the Real World San Diego "I'm to punk rock for this" reunion. It was pretty good. And then around 10:00 I had my project finised and my head was pounding. I went up to get some more medicane and I told my mom Jessica Simpson has the same kind of dog as us, and then I just went downstairs and went to bed. My head was pounding but I went to bed pretty fast. I got a good nights sleep, and I woke up this morning actually not that tired. I was tired but not as much as usual. And then I went into school a little earlier and had Mr. Reem copy something for my report. And then when school started I had to take Jenny and Kailes quiz which was hard, I don't know how well I did on that. But Haley's and Roxanne's was easy, so after that me and Ryn gave our project and I think it went pretty well. Mr. Reem kept adding stuff, but I think that's a good thing. Because everythign he said, we had, so hopefully I get an A on it, that's all that matters. Everyone got lots of suckers from us, especially Tara, she got tons. But after we gave our report we finished watching the Sex thing on Clarance Thomas, and then it was time to go. I still haven't started my term paper for that class. I'm so screwed. But after school I gave Ryn a ride home but we had to go pick my brother up at golf first. Then I am home right now just doing nothing. I'm bored. Well I'm starving too. Talk to ya later. See-ya.
