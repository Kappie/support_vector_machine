Tis a shame, you already have...  And so I stopped by Just once more I would like to flash a smile Just laugh along at the movie And have you by my side in front of the telly Tis a shame it'll end eventually Oh baby baby say you'll stay  Chances are, you already have... Tis a shame, you already have...  I'll find a way to let you know Holding you close when tradewinds blow I should have never hesitate Cause baby baby you've gone away I'll catch that train soon eventually Oh baby baby I hope you'll remember me  Chances are, you already have... Tis a shame, you already have...  Said I'm sorry...
