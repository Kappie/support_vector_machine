My mind is drifting in a direction where I can't say, even here, what I want because it may ruin friendships or impact ppl, in a less than positiveway, who may or may not read this. So, if this turns out to be my last entry, then it's been fun, and I bid you farewell. If it's not, then I hope you enjoy my next post.
