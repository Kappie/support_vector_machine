Common Assumption 2: Love is regarded by the majority of humanity to be one of the most important factors in their general level of happiness and contentment.  Common Assumption 3: Love, when aroused, has the most potent influence on human action of any emotion.  Omnia vincit amor . Love conquers all.  Common Assumption 4: The capacity to love and the desire to love and be loved are intrinsic to human nature.  The first thing I'd argue is that nobody even knows what love is, because it isn't anything, except an artificial abstract construct employed to romanticise a chemical technique the genome employs to aid the fulfilment of the fundamental and essential carnal instinct towards self propagation, but that viewpoint (although, I believe, veracious) is effectively irrelevant in the everyday practical world, as it is an inescapably pervasive notion.  This concept of love we have created, that evinces itself with such ubiquity in our lives, and is exalted so highly, is simultaneously the cause of damage depredation destruction degredation dilapidation denunciation delapsion disgust dismay despair dissolution death decay... Etcetera, woe is us with our stricken hearts, boohoo.  But seriously.  Heaven has no rage like love to hatred turned.  So what I ask, is whether, or whether not, it is best that this notion of love be preserved?  To be continued.
