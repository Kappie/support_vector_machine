I've finally picked up the sorcerer's stone, which I think is the first book(someone tell me) that has been sitting on my shelf for an eternity and decided to read it so I think that's telling about the movie.  I enjoyed it, definately a visual feast and fun.  Even not knowing the background the story was simple enough to understand.  Is that kid who had the blonde hair and was a little biatch in the first 2 movies?
