Of course, I know that I can do better, especially when I focus my attention over my English performance. That's probably the subject that really sticks out like a sore thumb.  63.8% for English. That's really disappointing to know. Just a mark less on my Mid-Year paper, and I'll be in for English remedial. Which simply amounts to the fact that I'm of the weaker students in the school when it comes to English. This is of a great importance or might be better described as irritation and disturbance. English is an important subject. Not just here in Victoria School, nor Singapore, but all over the world. It means as much as you can't do anything if you're not proficient at it. Furthermore, I'm a humanities student. Where am I ever going to land up without a good command of the English Language? Just when I was thinking of reading more Chinese books, the results and initial news of me entering the English remedial completely changed my mind. I'd be in the remedial alright, if I hadn't just when to see the principal and ask why I'm in it in the first place, since I passed the mark? I'm out of the remedial. Nonetheless, it is still humiliating and very disappointing to be that close. The reality pounces on me. 'You're bad at English!'  Therefore, it's going to be all out for English now. I'm going to get that A1 by all means. And prove to my dear principal that I didn't need his remedial. Why did he have shout at us anyway? We're free from his rememdial according to his requirements. 'You better make sure you do well in English!', he said. And worst of all, he wrote at the back of my report card, 'Given reprieve from English class.' He had to use the word 'reprieve'.  Oh Lord, curb my anger.
