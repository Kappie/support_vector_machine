"Hmmm, lets make really cool backrounds, but make all the main characters look like they escaped from a sega saturn."  I mean, really. What would anyone make the backrounds look 300 times better than the characters? That make no sense. But then again, maybe enix is the one that tells square that they are idiots. Lurker, you better not do what these genuises have done.  And now back to buisness. Media server status: Offline. Redoing all the images, Re-scripting page. Ready in like 6 days.
