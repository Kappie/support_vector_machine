So, tonight I'll make it even better with 4 blogs to review, if I can stay awake, and I should be able to.  Later today begins the first installment of Nerdular Nerdance: Yearbook Camp. I've still got some camp stories to do, and I'll talk with other yearbook staffers (maybe) to see if they're as hyped up as I am about this...my summer has literally been the worst summer ever. Then,  Monday morning at 6:30 a.m., I'm turning to audio blogging for the rest of the week. Then Thursday, I come back and post the new camp stories from this year's camp. Sound interesting? With a yearbook staff as hilarious as mine, there are sure to be some interesting moments. And  of course I'm going to post about them!  Last night was such a long night... I fell asleep, then my dog came in at around 1:00 because it was thundering out, and it scares her, and then she woke me up, and then I fell back asleep, and 2 minutes later she wanted out. So I let her out. Then, I fell back asleep, only to wake up at 6:00 this morning because I forgot to unset my alarm from yesterday. Then I fell back asleep, and now I'm awake again. I hate it when this happens.   Today I think I'm gonna lounge around, play a little Xbox, watch a couple movies...that kind of thing. I have so much stuff to start thinking about packing, because my mom wants me packed by tomorrow afternoon, so that she can start making her checklist for the trip to New York.That will be a really, really long trip that I'm not looking forward to. But, at least we're stopping at Paramount in North Carolina on the way, and then Paramount in Virginia on the way back. Two Paramount parks in one outing... that should be...interesting. They better have good rides.  So, that's it for now. Join me later for the big event...the start of this month's Nerdular Nerdance report! It's going to be entertaining and hilarious, ALL WEEK LONG! I'll have it up at around 1:00 this afternoon.
