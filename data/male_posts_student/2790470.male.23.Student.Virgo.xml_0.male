For her,  you and I will have to build this developed India. You must proclaim. India is  not an under-developed nation; it is a highly developed nation.  Do you have  10 minutes? Allow me to come back with a vengeance. Got 10  minutes for your country? If yes, then read; otherwise, choice is yours. YOU say  that our government is inefficient. YOU say  that our laws are too old. YOU say  that the municipality does not pick up the garbage. YOU say  that the phones don't work, the railways are a  joke, The airline  is the worst in the world, mails never reach their destination.   You say that our  country has  been fed to the dogs  and is the absolute pits. YOU say, say and say. What do YOU do about it?   Take a person on his way to Singapore.   Give him a name?   YOURS.   Give him a face?   YOURS.   YOU walk out of the airport and you are at your International best.   - In Singapore you don't throw cigarette       on the roads or eat in the stores.   - YOU are as proud of their Underground Links as they are.   - You pay $5 (approx. Rs.60) to drive through Orchard Road (equivalent of Mahim Causeway or     Pedder Road) between 5 PM and 8 PM.   - YOU comeback to the parking lot to punch your parking ticket if you have over-stayed,      identity.   In Singapore you don't say anything, DO YOU?   - YOU wouldn't dare to eat in public during Ramadan, in Dubai.   - YOU would not dare to go out without your head covered in Jeddah.   - YOU would not dare to buy an employee of the telephone exchange in London at 10 pounds     (Rs.650) a month to, "see to it that my STD and ISD calls are billed to someone else."   - YOU would not dare to speed beyond 55 mph (88 km/h) in Washington and then tell the traffic     cop, "Jaanta hai main kaun hoon (Do you know who I am?).  I am so and so's son. Take your     two bucks and get lost."   - YOU wouldn't chuck an empty coconut shell anywhere other than the garbage pail on the     beaches in Australia and New Zealand.     Why don't YOU spit Paan on the streets of Tokyo?   Why don't YOU use examination jockeys or buy fake certificates in Boston?????   We are still talking of the same YOU.   YOU who can respect and conform to a  foreign system in other countries but cannot in your own. You who will throw papers and             on the road the moment you touch Indian ground.   If you can be an involved and appreciative citizen in an alien country, why cannot you be the same here in India? Once in an  interview, the famous Ex-municipal Commissioner of     ay, Mr. Tinaikar, had a point to make.     "Rich people"s dogs  are walked on the streets to leave their affluent droppings all over the place," he said. "And then the same  people turn around to criticize and blame the authorities for inefficiency and dirty pavements. What do they expect the officers to do? Go down with a broom every time their dog feels the pressure in his  bowels?  In America every dog owner has to clean up after his pet has done the job. Same in Japan. Will the Indian citizen do that here?"    He's right. We go to the polls to choose a government and after that forfeit all responsibility.   We sit back wanting to be pampered and expect the government to do everything for us whilst our contribution is totally negative. We expect the government to clean up but we are not going to stop chucking garbage all over the place nor are we going to stop to pick a up a stray piece of paper and throw it in the bin.     We expect the railways to provide clean bathrooms but we are not going to learn the proper use of  bathrooms.  We want Indian Airlines and Air India to provide the best of food and toiletries but we are not going to stop pilfering at the least opportunity. This applies even to the staff who is  known not to pass on the service to the public.     When it comes to burning social issues like those related to women, dowry,      child and others, we make loud drawing room protestations and continue to do the reverse at home.  Our excuse?   "It's the whole system which has to change, how will it matter if I alone forego my son's rights to a dowry."     So who's going to change the system? What does a  system consist of?  Very conveniently for us it consists of our neighbours, other households, other cities, other communities and the government.   But definitely not me and YOU.   When it comes to us actually making a  positive contribution to the system we lock ourselves along with our families into a safe cocoon and look into the distance at countries far away and wait for a Mr. Clean to come along  work miracles for us with a majestic sweep of his hand or we leave the country and run away.  - Like lazy cowards hounded by our fears we run to America to bask in their glory and praise      their system.     - When New York becomes insecure we run to England.     - When England experiences unemployment, we take the next flight out to the Gulf.     - When the Gulf is war struck, we demand to be rescued and brought home by  the Indian     government.     Everybody is out to abuse and rape the country.   Nobody thinks of feeding the system.   Our conscience is mortgaged to money.   Dear Indians, the article is highly thought inductive, calls for a great deal of introspection and      s one's conscience too?..   I am echoing J.F. Kennedy's words to his fellow American to relate to Indians?. "ASK WHAT WE CAN DO FOR INDIA AND DO WHAT HAS TO BE DONE TO MAKE INDIA WHAT AMERICA AND OTHER WESTERN COUNTRIES ARE TODAY " Lets do what India needs from us.   Forward  this mail to each Indian for a change instead of sending Jokes or junk mails. Thank You, Dr. Abdul  Kalaam
