Hence it is taken while I was walking so at an angle I have purposely neglected to sort out [the photo was taken on holiday a few years ago in another European country - I won't say which as I have seen similar statements in other countries as well as Britain]      So why have I posted a picture of a politically incorrect statement to my blog? Because quite frankly I can - I far from agree with it - my beliefs are quite opposite really but I am not going to get to my political beliefs just yet. So here is my piece; should this statement be removed?
