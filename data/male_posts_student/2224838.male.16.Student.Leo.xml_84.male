    
       I just spent about 14 hours at school. Eight hours of regular classes, an hour or so working on my social studies demonstration after school, and around 5 hours working on the next issue of the school newspaper. Even after the five hours of working on the newspaper, I'm still not done with my section, and it has to be ready by the end of school tomorrow. (This can probably be attributed to the fact that half of the time I'm there, I'm talking and eating junk food.)  But even though it sounds like I'm complaining, I actually enjoy "paste-up" nights for the newspaper. ("Paste-up" refers to the construction of a newspaper, without the use of computers, by literally pasting the stories and photos on the pages.) For some reason I tend to be particularly funny while I'm working on the newspaper. Somehow I feed off of the conversation around me and make humorous remarks in return.
