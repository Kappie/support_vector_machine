That meant we had to cut the mains. It was really amusing how we collected water to last the night until tomorrow morning when my dad gets a new tap or shower mixer as they call it. Water's precious. Save every drop of it. Sounds like a campaigh huh.  I thought I should have taken some pictures and... I did. Hee. Here they are...
