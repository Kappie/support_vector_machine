I went to Wendy's house to study in the afternoon, as usual. I completed the chapters of differentiation and integration there. Two major important chapters completed! Woo-hoo! We cooked hot dogs and instant noodles too. Always eat there one. Ha!! Today, Wendy fell sick, so I made her sleep. I helped her to boil the water and pour into containers. HaHa! Hmmm...she seems pretty sick. Get lotsa rest hor. Get well soon for Bio exam, Wendy! After that leh, we went down to eat. This is one of my most fun times eating together. We laughed and talked a lot. HaHa!! :D   Came back, bathed and came online. I had to make this short...later no time to write le. I had to go watch Singapore Brainiest Teacher. See ya tomorrow! Bye blog!
