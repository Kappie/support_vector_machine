You said to me, "Steve, I like cooking, and I like eating, and all that, but it's so hard to cook just for one, couldn't there be some sort of eating or dining club for people like me?  You're so dreamy, can't you help me come up with some sort of solution? Thanks a lot, Hungry in Harvard Square."  Well HIHS, I am  urlLink dreamy . And of course I can help you. Of course, you could start an eating or cooking club if you wanted to, but you've already stumbled upon that option.  And diffrent schedules can make finding a common mealtime a chore rather than a joy.  Besides, sometimes you just don't want to watch other people eat, not to mention the bothersome talking.  But that doesn't mean you have to eat poorly.  There's a new cookbook written just for you:  urlLink Solo Suppers .  You can buy it and other wonderful titles from  urlLink Wordsworth  and NOT from other multinational online booksmellers named after certain jungles.   You should be able to cook tasty and easy meals just for one.  While you're at it, why not open a bottle of wine just for you; you're worth it.  Maybe you can even get lucky with yourself.    Have a question? Need advice? Want a children's book recommendation? email  urlLink Dreamy Steve . for answers to all your questions.
