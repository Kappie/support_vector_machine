We attacked mark with the laser pointer. mark and kevin left. Vincent adn Adam stayed til 4 AM. Then we dropped off Vincent and Adam and me came back to my house and he slept over. Now, where does the smuttiness start? Well, after adam left I took the most horrific shit of my life. How bad? It was a three-pronged attack. 4 bathrooms in my house; I used 3 of them to distribute the rancidness. No one bathroom could handle it all. That's the last time I eat pizza, popcorn, and an assortment of nuts and seeds at 4 AM.   -Suicide Smutter
