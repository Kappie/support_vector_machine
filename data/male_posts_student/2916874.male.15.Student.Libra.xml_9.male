I went up to a house and knocked and I ran but I tripped and my shoe flew off and I couldn't find it. He chased us, and told us to go away. Bart had to go and get my shoe. He snuck through the back yard from the woods. My shoe was stuck behind a tree hidden. It was really funny.   We also went on a bike ride to go pick up pop bottles on the side of the road. We went down a huge long dirt road a couple of miles down. We turned left in a fork in the road and we went down more. We didn't find any cans so I talked them to go into the woods. The woods were on either side. The woods were dense too.   So we went in and we came upon a swamp. We went into it. After a few minutes Jesse fell in. A little later my shoe went in and I fell to my knees. I was laughing so hard, it was really funny! :-)  We got out of the woods and we went back home. As we were riding home we came up with a plan to tell their mom. We were going to tell her that we saw a pop can on the side of the road, by a ditch full of water, and I went to go pick it up and I fell in. Jesse also got wet because he tried to help me. So when we got back we told Mrs. Benn that and she believed us.  We also rented movies. We rented "Cat in the Hat", "Brother Bear", "Ernest's Snowboarding school", "Willard", and "Cold Creek Manor".  I watched "Willard". It was about a guy that has no friends and he befriends rats and trains them to kill. I also saw "Cold Creek Manor". It was about a family that moved into a house. The previous owner showed up and he wanted his house back so he tried to kill them. "Cat in the Hat" was gay and I never want to see it again. :-(  So on Tuesday night we were being loud at 1 o'clock at night. Mrs. Benn heard us 5 boys upstairs and she sent Kristle up stairs to tell us to be quiet. We told her to leave, and Mrs. Benn heard and told us we were going home tomorrow. So the next day we packed up and went home. Mrs. Benn was really, really, p*ssed.   My dad came to pick me up and I've been chillin here all along. That was my Spring Break. It is Friday now and I have 3 days left up break. I've had the funnest spring break in a looooong time. Peace out ya'll!!! CYA.
