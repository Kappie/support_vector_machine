Anyway, I saw   urlLink The Passion   on Wednesday and thought it was great. I don't think there could be a more accurate, moving, or cinematically superior rendition of the most important twelve hours in world history. I recommend seeing it unless you get sick easily or are too young to deal with the very brutal and bloody scourging at the pillar.  I also liked the language. :)  Two lines that I remember:   Ecce homo!  : Behold the man!  Quid est veritas?  : What is truth?  Both said by  urlLink Pontius Pilate , one of my favorite characters in the Passion narrative. He's a very interesting character due to his personality and struggle with condemning Jesus to death.   SYNOPSIS : Definitely worth seeing, be you Christian or not.
