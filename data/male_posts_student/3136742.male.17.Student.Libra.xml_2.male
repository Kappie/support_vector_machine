Boxer-Briefs, briefs...)The whole idea stumps them. Why would any guy wear anything but boxers? Perhaps a little explanation is in order: Ladies, some of you bitch about your bras, some of you can't function without them. While small-breasted women can opt to not wear a bra, thus becoming more comfortable, a majority of massively mammaried women can not live without the support of their  knocker lockers . Why? Because big tits flap around. They get in the way. They have a mind of their own and need to be contained... What does this have to do with boxers?... Well, it's the same thing for men. Ill equipped guys can deal with the bulkiness of boxers. There's enough room under their pants to accommodate the otherwise immobilizing folds of cotton. Those of us with  Sizeable Schwanzes  need to wrap it up. We can't afford to have unwanted flappage. It causes drag, and if you shave you'll have to be careful when you sit down otherwise everyone in the room will know your nuts are balled (harhar-double entendre). The shit gets in the way and it has to be situated, if not-- if in the event you have to run-- you stand the chance of tripping over yourself. Briefs and boxer-briefs are reassurance that everything is there and where it should be, not doing it's own thing. Now, going commando is a whole other thing involving airflow, free flappage, and exhibitionistic tendencies. I wont get into that here... at least not now... It should also be said that there are certain fellows who don't think this way and actually enjoy maximum flappage, and there is also the converse-- small, agoraphobic vienna saussages which must hide behind their tight cotton cage, lest anyone know their true physical form.  Plain breifs (whitie tighties) are ghey though.  Now that that's all been cleared up I'm going to get back to reading. I've just finished the second (2nd) story in James Joyce's  Dubliners . Though  very  well written, it's quite disturbing. So far it's only about pedophilia and homosexuality in 1890's Catholic Ireland. Very good. Very Creepy. --- actually. That's all bullshit... There's not truth to that at all. I just wanted to write something stupid... I only have 2 pairs of boxers, everything else is boxer briefs, but they're from when I was really fat so they fit like boxers... DERP!
