HERE'S THE TRUTH: From  urlLink indybay.org : "Limbaughâ€™s radio program is broadcast to American troops via the American Services Network, a taxpayer-funded radio and television broadcasting agency."  -------  Mike said: People actually Pay Money to carry [his] show since doing so in turn makes them money. This is how success is measured and rewarded in the USA.   I SAY: Not everyone believes that wealth equals success. Mother Teresa wasn't a wealthy woman, per se, but we are now considering her for sainthood. Was she not a success?  -------  Mike said: Tax dollars only fund failures.   I SAY: In the case of Rush Limbaugh, this is very true.  -------  Mike says: If PBS was so valuable to its audience they would be worth advertisers' dollars.   I SAY: Advertisers bring bias with them. That's what makes NPR great: There are no advertisers to please. Advertisers only care about ratings; about how many people will hear there ads. With advertisers, stations are pressured to pull in the biggest audience they can, which means providing programming that appeals to the lowest common denominator, which means shows like "Who Wants to Marry My Dad?". You won't find these mindless shows on PBS or NPR. And by the way, PBS and NPR are valuable to its audience. That's why, twice a year, individuals (like me) pledge their support to help fund them.  -------  Mike says: Why would it matter if anything is "fair and balanced"? Fox claims it because they ahve shows like Hannity and Colmes. Hannity is conservative and Colmes is liberal. Fox claims to be free of bias, but of course being human they can't be. But they are at least making a try at it. CNN and NPR probably think they aren't biased, but they surely are. And guess which way their dishonest bias shifts?  I SAY: If you want the truth about Fox News, buy  urlLink Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism . I'm not even going to discuss Fox News as if it were a genuine news source. It's not. Watch this documentary.   -------  Mike says: I don't care how biased any "news" source is as long as they are up-front about it.  I SAY: That's a shame. So you're just going to give in to growing media consolidation, resulting in more bias, and say "I don't care"? As a media reform activist, and American citizen, this attitude offends me more than you'll ever know.  -------  Mike says: The NYT and CNN are certianly not up-front with their liberal bias yet you probably think they are the most objective sources out there. Another fact you can't seem to acknowledge.  I SAY: I don't think you never mentioned NYT's and CNN's bias, so how was I supposed to know you needed me to acknowledge this "fact"? But now that you brought it up, I'm going to deny that their biased until you show me proof as to what makes these news sources bias. You love to demand proof out of me, even though you just ignore or disregard any proof that I present (remember our little chat on preventing 9/11?). So now I ask you: Prove to me that CNN and NYT are bias.  -------  I said that Limbaugh said: "Playground bullying is good for kids"  Mike said: He specifically said that bullies, as a recent study shows, are more assertive and popular. He didn't say it was good for kids, just that bullying has 2 sides. It was in his "light-hearted stack" so it was meant to be humorous. I laughed at it myself.  I SAY: If what you say he said is true (which you haven't proven, the way you demanded I prove that Bush said that they had found WMD), then it still is a mean thing to say. As a victim of bullying, I know that there is nothing humorous about it.   So, Rush said this was meant to be light-hearted? You yourself laughed at this? That's a kick in the teeth for all I'm concerned.  -------  I said that Limbaugh said: Environmentalists are "wacko"  Mike said: Whacko environmentalists are whacko. For instance, those that support Kyoto, that say global warming will kill us all, those that would rather save trees/animals than people. Those are whackos. Greenpeace is whacko. Most of these people are really just socialists and anti-capitalists. They wield the environmentalist club to beat down their enemies.  I SAY: So Limbaugh DID say this, huh? You're not denying he said it. Now you're just fanning a flag of hatred. I don't even know how to respond to these accusations you've spewed out with no regard to proof or facts. Do you have facts to support your claims here? You demand them out of me, I'll demand them out of you.  -------  I said that Limbaugh said: "Corporations that set up phony headquarters in the Caribbean to avoid paying income taxes are doing the right thing"  Mike said: A company's actions are never right or wrong. They merely "are."  I SAY: So you're not only admitting that Rush  did  say this, but you're also disagreeing with what he said? Good to hear.  -------  I said that Limbaugh said: "A war every 20 years or so would be a good thing so that young Americans of every generation would know what it's like to be victorious"  Mike said: What's wrong with this?   I SAY: Again, you are saying that these words did come from Rush, so I was not making it up. As for this question of "what's wrong with this," my reason is simple: war is meant to be the last resort. We try to resolve conflict through peaceful means before we go to war. Pearl Harbor was bombed, indicating that the Japanese were not about to listen to reason, so we went to war. Terrorists flew planes into the twin towers, so we went to war against these terrorists. Sadaam did not have anything to with 9/11, nor did he present any clear and imminent threat to America, so going to war in Iraq was uncalled for.  -------  I said: "Rush expounds on education, though he never went to college."  Mike said: He has experience and accomplishments to back up his advice.  I SAY: Such as...?  -------  I said: "He [Limbaugh] expounds on the war on drugs, though he has a drug problem and has purchased illegal drugs."  Mike said: His opinions on drugs have matured over the years. You can't say for sure if he has committed a crime until he is convicted. But I'm sure a little thing like due process won't stop you.  I SAY: You seem to like jumping to conclusions about how I feel about a lot of fundamental American ideas. No, I agree with due process. As for whether or not he's guilty of having a drug problem, lookey here:  urlLink Limbaugh admits addiction to pain medication . It mentions in the third paragraph that these painkillers were illegal to buy/own unless prescribed by a licensed physician. What do his medical records show?  urlLink Here's a peek . Looks like he  was  prescribed these painkillers for a while, but when his prescription ran out, he went "doctor shopping" ("trying to find a physician willing to prescribe drugs illegally," as defined by the investigators in the context of this case.)  -------  I said: "You don't like the idea of the wealthiest Americans paying taxes to support the poor? Rush Limbaugh has been on welfare."  Mike said: Is he on it now? We conservatives judge the success of a government program by how many people no longer need it.  I SAY: Then why do "you conservatives" want to cut the funding of welfare programs, or cut them all together? Is it because you don't think people should  ever  get the aid of this government program? If so, what do you have to say about Limbaugh using it?  -------  I said: "NPR is non-partisan; it deserves funding. Rush Limbaugh isn't; he doesn't deserve squat."  Mike said: To close us out, what in the world caused you to think that Rush Limbaugh got any government funding?   -------  I SAY:  urlLink This, for one.   -------  Mike said: The closest thing I can think of is that Armed Forces Radio does carry 1 hour of Rush every weekday.  I SAY: Exactly.  -------  Mike said: They pay him for this the same way they pay for all their programming. They also carry NPR.  I SAY: NPR is not partisan. Rush Limbaugh is extremely partisan. Carrying NPR doesn't cancel out the fact that they carry Rush Limbaugh (which, as you've said, is a for-profit, commercial program). A right-wing radio show can't be balanced off with politically neutral programs from NPR. Maybe if they also carried Air America programming, then that would be fair.
