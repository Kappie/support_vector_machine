Well...I, we rather, went to treat my leg. Guess the infection's bad enough for my parents to  finally  take action.   Well. We went to the Skin Clinic. The nurse said we must get a referral letter. Cannot suddenly walk in there one. Sigh. Thus, we went to Woodlands Polyclinic, reaching there at 9.40+.  I spent the whole hour plus reading The Time Traveler's Wife. Well, my number was called and I entered the office of Dr Tan something something.  My god. My god! He can only offer me a reason for the rash and boils. Internal infection. Well, at least it isn't the soap. I wonder what it is. Of course, we got that referral letter to the Skin Centre. My appointment is on July 23rd. A Friday. I got a morning appointment. Guess what that means! I gotta skip school! Hurrah! Hurray!  Yes. All wild shouts aside. I received an SMS from CQ, lamenting and bemoaning about the loss of a much-needed friend. (:P to CQ if you are reading this) After calling, I found out that the whole gang is in McDonalds nearby. I went to visit them.  Well well well. What have I found and observed? A lot of things. Even ducks were meowing and quacking, but all that wouldn't make a difference unless initiative is taken, ya know. (I relish in the thought of forever torturing this blog with hidden hints. :P) After we talked, I went back to Mother.   Oh dear. I am stuck with anti-biotics and cream. Yeah. We went for lunch. Chicken rice is simple delicious at 301 (I believe that's the correct block number). We went home.  Right. I surfed the Net. Uneventful. I know. However, due to some recomendations from a friend, I came upon  urlLink Iresistible Poison . Another Harry/Draco slash! I am forever addicted to slashes. As you all know, I spent the better part of my afternoon reading this story.   Oh my god! This is so terribly touching! I was crying at the end. Harry and Draco suffered so much trials and tribulations...all for love. They love each other truly, madly, deeply. The author really stayed true to the book, writing Draco and Harry exactly the way they were. The love....is so touching. It transcends beyonds worlds and universe. Ahh...such love. It made me cry. I feel the hurt when Draco ditched Harry (deluded fool, but don't worry, they will patch back up). I feel the love when they are together. The love.  Right. Okay. I watched TV lor. I came online and did PW work. I feel so pressurized by my brother's tutor. I have to teach him SS and Chem. Not that I'm unwilling, but I lack proper materials! The SS Levels notes are missing, and my brother's teacher did not give that to him. Further more, he did not copy when the teacher told them! ERGH! Chem is easy to teach.   Anyhoo. I gotta go now. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!
