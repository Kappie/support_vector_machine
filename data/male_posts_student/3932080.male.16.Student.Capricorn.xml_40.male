Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.    urlLink Dip It Low -Christina Milian Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #11 Using the clubbier cousin to the stutter-step beat from Mario Winans “I Don’t Wanna Know,” Christina Milian’s “Dip It Low” is a how-to guide for females to get “your man [to] say ‘oh’.” Suggesting the ever-sluttier alternative to conversation, Christina urges her listeners to “meet him at the door with nothing on,” a brilliant lyric that speaks both to overt sexiness and global over-consumption of clothing. But when you’re riding some naughty Eastern strings and a continuously coital bass line, it’s hard not to be hot, and Christina perfectly plays the tour guide through some sweaty sexscapades. Thanks to “Dip It Low,” this summer will have considerably less instances of gettin’ dirrty, puttin’ the key in your ignition, and backin’ that ass up.    The Verdict:  6.6/10 - The Fork   (3.3/5)
