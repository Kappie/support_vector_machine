Here is the message:  "This is a nice game This game is my first work. You're the first player. I wish you would like it."  This time, it was from someone named "Ibty" at "Ibty@irr.o."  I did a search on Irr.o, and it doesn't exist. I sent a reply e-mail, it came back  as non-existant. This is starting to creep me out.  I'm the first player? What game is this?
