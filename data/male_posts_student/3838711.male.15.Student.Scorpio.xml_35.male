Just switched on the computer, but I leapt into bed for a short nap (well it aint that short, around 2 hours..) So after having dinner outside, I decided that I do this entry earlier. Since.. there might or might not be time later.  Needed this nap kinda badly. Felt so lethargic in class that I slept through the first 2 lessons of the day. Maths. I sure hope I didnt miss out any important details of it though... After which I sort of got back the energy to do work again, so I stayed awake for the whole day..  Sitting in a corner at the back of the class (due to register number order), I could say that the corner by the window sure was a cozy area, and it provided a gateway to letting me think of things.. a whole lot of them. And due to the teacher not always laying his attention on me, I could think of some things without disruption. I've always enjoyed my time while I was there, having a wall to lie sideways and backwards, and a handrest on the bars. Beats me but since young, I've always preferred corners rather than open areas. In a secluded world of my own ? I wonder.  So today was a good day, nice sun (crap), and a smooth day at school. And I got my chemistry and history test papers back. Guess what, I topped both of them, with 31.5/49 and 18/25 respectively. Very pleasant surprise, because like I said, I dont put high hopes on my work. At least not since Sec 1 ? Didnt expect to pull this semester of so well.... already topped 2, and came in second for 1 test. No, for readers who dont know me well, I'm not a bright child. Serious. And thanks to William for letting me "peep" into his physics test paper, since I didnt got enough time to study for it... Haha....  Went to Compass with KL and Sherman after school, couldnt find a running shoe I want, so went home feeling disappointed. Didnt even have lunch, both of them were broke.  Maybe it was due to insufficient sleep, I had a bad temper till I woke up... but gladly I didnt have the chance to throw it on anyone.... Haha.  Ok la... thats about it for today, dont really have anything much to blog, just that, seeing the couples on the streets, makes me envy them a lot. Lacking the love. Haha. Usual stuff. Whats new anyway.  Benedict signing out.
