Anyway took another visit to Chester... seemed less fat people today than last time but they seemed slightly fatter than before. Anyway I was pressurized in to buying a Big Issue type thing today by the seller and my friend, £3 for something which was patently worth hardly anything as it was just photocopied.  Lesson; don't give in to peer pressure.
