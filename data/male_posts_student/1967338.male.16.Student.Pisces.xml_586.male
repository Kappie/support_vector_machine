See, my reason for quitting was of course Jekyll and Hyde, but Mr. Noffke doesn't want me to take two consecutive weeks off (Triennium and Newspaper camp) and I can't quit those, since my parents have already put down about $300 for each.  If I'm out of Jekyll and Hyde for that, I might as well do Marching Band.  EDIT: Noffke's gonna let me get do it, so I guess I am quitting.  But if I miss one day, I'm out.   Also, Nathan and I started building a boat today.  It also started flooding.  Amazingly enough, these two things are not related. Inspired by an episode of Biography on A last night, Nathan and I have officially made our college plans.  We're going to NYU to study acting, just like the Olsen twins.  In fact, they'll still be there, so we're planning to either marry them or collaborate on an award-winning sitcom, or both.  With the acting genius of Nathan and I and the star power of MK  Ashley, we'll be rich.  It's fool-proof. (My title is the prospective title of the show or an associated autobiography). Also, that's the new "We should get married... to other people." Now it's "We should get married... to the Olsen twins." In conclusion, the boredom of the summer is almost certianly getting to us.   I'm sorry Mario, your princess is in another Chinese restaurant!
