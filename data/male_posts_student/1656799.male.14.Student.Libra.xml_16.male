So, me being very smug and pleased with myself, I've decided to make a third entry of the day.   I didn't manage to sleep until 3am, so to make up for it I slept until 1:30pm. Showered quickly, logged onto MSN and spoke to Devon and Stephen for a while whist waiting for James to come online. Once he did, a meet-up was arranged and I left the house ten minutes later.  Met James at 3:10pm, we were both five minutes late as it seems. Made our way up the hill and had a chat, then waited for Stephen and Devon to arrive.  3:35pm, Stephen and Devon still hadn't arrived and boredom had begun to settle in. Loaded batteries into camera and took a picture of where we were waiting. Yes, I know its not exactly the most exciting thing to do when you're bored, but still it kept me busy seeing as my camera takes a while to load.     Luckily Stephen and Devon arrived a few minutes later, just in time before I really did get bored. This saved me from taking pictures of my foot, as you do.  We arsed around in Lawns Wood for awhile before going to Co-Op to get something to drink, then came back to Lawns Wood. I felt things were going to get a bit dull again, so I scraped through my mind for ideas, until finally one cropped up:   "Hey guys! Lets play a game of Hide and Seek!"     Then what followed could only be described as fun, even though tiring and slightly childish. Four teenagers running around Lawns Wood hiding from each other is always fun, because, lets face it, theres nothing better to do in Swindon.  Saw Michael, Simon and Ben and let them join the game. They didn't do very well though, with me and Devon working as a team we were unbeatable. (Of course, there was no cheating involved).  Rode down the hill on Ben's bike thinking to myself, "Wheeeeeeeee!" and then the long ride back up the hill again. Well, I gave up on that one and just walked the bike up.  By 6pm Devon and James had left, and Michael, Simon and Ben went off somewhere else. Feeling hungry, me and Stephen decided to go and get something to eat from Co-op. The only problem was that we still had a Co-Op bag with us, containing seven party-sized Milky Ways and an empty bottle of Pepsi.  Our only solution was to hide the Milky Ways in Lawns Wood, in a location only we knew. We looked around, and deciding not to hidethemunder a tree, we hid them in a hole in a wall instead. We resolved that should we leave them for an hour or two, then they would be safe and not found. Hell, we could have even left them there overnight and picked them up the next day, seeing as we were all going to meet again.  It would not be so.  Having bought some crisps, a chocolate bar and a drink each, for the lovely price of Â£2.97, we went to the Town Gardens to take some pictures and relax for a while, the earlier events of Hide and Seek had tired us out after all.  Looked at the aviary for a while, took some pictures and then walked along the park.           Weeee budgies!  The park itself is very nice, very peaceful despite those who breaks the rules of the grounds, playing ball games and being generally loud.                             Whilst walking we found a squirrel, its true.     We tried to get closer, but the little critter ran as soon as he saw me with my camera. I blame the camera. Ugly thing.     So at 7:50pm after finishing taking pictures, we decided to head home after a long-ish day. As we got to Lawns Wood we remembered the Milky Ways, and set off to get them. In the distance we could see an old lady with a dog, led by a wall, and pulling out a shopping bag. Getting closer we could see that she was examining it, pulling something out, putting it back in and then walking off with the bag. Two seconds later, me and Stephen were in hysterics.  The old lady had found our Milky Ways and had off with them. We thought it was bad for us to even leave chocolate in Lawns Wood and come back for it later, let alone an old lady to look around, find them, and take them for ourself.  Part of us was in hysterics at the thief, and another part of us was feeling robbed, and lets face it, we were.  We had lost seven Milky Ways, these were going to be used the next day as food, and now we would have to get some more food for tomorrow.  We finally went home after confirming that the old lady did indeed thieve our chocolate and rested.  This brings an end to todays' events, and now my fingers are hurting from typing too much.  Will update some more soon, ciao.
