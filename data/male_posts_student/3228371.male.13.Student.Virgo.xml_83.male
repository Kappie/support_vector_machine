Haven't studied. Gonna flunk. What's worse? It's "that time of the month" again. Blah. Whatever.   Hmm, I talked to Sam today. Sam as in Samantha, not Sammo or Sammy. Anyway... Sam, Angie, and I talked. Well, Sam and I talked a bit about Moses. Moses is her cousin. Anyway... before I said anything, she just knew he liked me. That's... weird. Blah. Girls always have pretty accurate instincts for a lot of stuff anyway. So yeah... We had our little girl talk and guess what Nima was doing? BASKETBALL-ing. Whatever. Anyway... yeah...   Before that, IngiEE and I were outside talking while I lay down and then I saw Will park his cool car and I ran over and gave him a hug. Missed him. Haven't seen him in AGES! Before we left, I went to give him a hug but he was sweaty too so blah. Haha! Ew. Anyways... Yeah...   I don't feel like doing anything anymore. Fuck it... Blah. Don't know, don't care. Blah. JoJo (Joanna Leung) came to Bethel today. I know a lot of guys think she's hot. Don't know if Nima think so. Even if he does he wouldn't say anything. So whatever. I don't care if he thinks she is though. Whatever. Blah. Don't know don't care. Hmm... I'm starting to like this phrase. So yeah... I'm probably going to do what I usually like doing when I get "whatever"-ish about everything because everything bugs me... SHOPPING. I'll go shopping for a semi-formal outfit for Sudbury or something. Haha... maybe I'll find a nice tanktop... I've been trying to look for a nice spaghetti strap... Blah. I'll see.   So tired... can't sleep... MSN... Blah. 11:30PM already. Missing him. Whatever. A bit hungry. Blah... Talking to Ingrid... my "whatever" buddy. Haha... I can talk to her about anything... we both bitch about wastebucket, we talk... and talk... and talk. :) TY IngiEE~
