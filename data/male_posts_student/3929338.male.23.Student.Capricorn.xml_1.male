I had to have the above three for my new part time job. Apparently a "Job Performance Test" where they make you do a bunch of dumb crap thats "related" to your job is required even though you've been doing said job elsewhere for  four miserable goddess forsaken years!     (silence)  Okay. Over it.  Thankfully my partner at work is a liar. He said the doctor would stick his finger up my butthole and grab my nuts, hopefully not at the same time. That would be awkward. This doctor was a D.O. after my own heart who was  not  a nut-grabber or a butt-fingerer. The only time I want to deal with the butt is my required rotation in Proctology or giving diazepam rectaly. Then all patients must be under 30, be attractive, smell okayand bein great shape. I've got2 out of4 but I don't plan on putting anything up my butt so its okay. Basically, no skanky smelly fat ugly geriatric people.  In other news.. my cat stinks... make that cats. Tonight is kitty cat bath night. Yay! I hope the neighbors have their earplugs in since I was holding Salem this morning while putting detergent in the wash.. he was yowling like I was sitting on him.   Dumb cat.
