A bunch of young men are being excused from military service due to a debilitating modern illness - internet addiction. Apparently anything can be thought of as an addiction these days. Of course you might expect someone who uses the Internet as much as I do to be cynical -- obviously I'm in denial. I wonder if there's a support group for folks like myself who cannot seem to resist an RSS feed.  I'm a pretty busy guy... hopefully the Internet Addiction support group meets online.
