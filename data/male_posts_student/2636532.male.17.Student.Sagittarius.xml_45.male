I guess I could say something about how nobody cares about this site at all. I mean Louis had only posted here 4 times and Matt did for a bit than quit. He hasn't even bothered to fix the message board or anything. Plus we don't get any traffic except for maybe people that get sent here by mistake when they do a search that goes bad or some people from forums I go to that might for some reason click on here by some form of boredom/curiosity. Then they realize all this site is for is so I can bitch and they quickly go away. My first posts here were actually good I think. Mostly since I was in a state of depression and it showed very much so in my writing and that made it somewhat interesting to read.  I just realized that even if you read all of my posts here you would know nothing about me. This really is nothing like a journal. You wouldn't know that I have 2 brothers and I only live with my mom or that my best friends are Louis and Keren or that I broke up with my boyfriend of 5 months on April 15th, almost exactly a month after I told him we were having problems. Neither would you know that I was going to break up with him on our 4 month anniversary, but somehow got convinced during our conversation that he would change and that he knew he wasn't treating me right in the first place. I never really realized it was 5 months until I woke up and the first thought in my head was "It's weird that I have a boyfriend and yet don't care that I haven't spent any time with him for about 2 weeks now. Plus before that it was about a week between times I saw him." I think the only reason we managed to spend 5 months together was because we never saw each other in the end and it didn't seem as if we were going out anyway. Also I knew that I wanted to be his friend and really that is what we became in the end of our relationship anyway. - Dark Lily  0>--}----
