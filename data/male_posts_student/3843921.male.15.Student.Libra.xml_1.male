Miss Sanggita (I think its spelled this way) entered into class although I predicted otherwise... Well... Nothing is sure in life. She is teaching us science instead if Moral. Concerning overfishing, we shouldnt catch those cute lil baby fishes, go for the big ones. She wants us to keep quiet. Keane wants my KH prize after he saw my invitation.. hehe. Keane just stated to the class that 'overanimaling' is as serious as overfishing. Class topic steered off course again and now the topic is music. Now we are encouraged to drink a little, supposedly its good for our health. Again she wants us to keep quiet since she doesnt believe in screaming at the top of her voicer. Dunno why Fung How and Eugene condemning Fletrisha in front of her, as though she can do anything... should complain to Miss Ma instead! Did some chem work.. not listening to her. Nigel just warned me not to write about him here but what to do? Said already too badlah.. He is probably camera shy or rather blog shy. Now Miss Sanggita (shes only 19!) is describing the evils of drinking. The class keeps steering her off course to talk crap. Lets see what we have discussed in the past hour. Protecting the environment -> Pollution -> Clubs in Bangsar -> Precautions when clubbing! ;) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 9.00 am Status : 'Offline Blog' Sanjit just said that Nigel is a nerd and doesnt want to be seen with him. This just sparked off one of the countless fights that have occured between them. Now Nigel is claming to be the best prefect! Nigel is trying to poison me by forcing me to breate fumes of burning plastic but I avoided. He just plotted to kill Kamil with the same method. In their fight, Nigel and Sanjit are behaving childishly, fighting over who knows what. They are playing around like small kids. Nigel's feelings are hurt.. How sad... "That was all a joke lah."  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 11:30 am Status : 'Offline Blog' Kamil, Sanjit and Nigel are fighting over who stole RM 20 from the prefect fund. They each want me to write down their own twisted version of the 'truth'. Keane is sweating all over, wonder what he has been doing. Now he is not in class .. ponteng... Looks like its going to rain.. Keane copied my wrong math homework. Haha! Can't wait to go home.. not that got anything special at home. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 12.35 pm Keane just sneezed and covered my hand with a lot of his saliva!! Gross! Its english now. Past Perfect Continuous .. I HAVE BEEN WRITING blogs since last week. Something that happened but continues to the present. Now PAST TENSES. We shouldnt be learning such basic grammar at this age.. Keane is trying to blackmail me for a scissors although I don't have one. Keane just embarassed me in front of the teacher!! He keep singing and chanting something that shouldn't be mentioned here in front of the teacher! Then he turned to the teacher and said "You know Joel........." and the teacher said "You are making him blush" !! Imagine!!! Its Nigel's fault cos now so many ppl are teasing me.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
