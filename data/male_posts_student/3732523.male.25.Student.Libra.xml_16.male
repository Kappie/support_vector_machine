We just passed CAN2 by 2 people.  Yeah!  Well, of course, thats assuming that all goes well and they all show.  So more people should sign up!  Go on - do it! You know you want to ;)  At any rate, today has been a weird day of laziness, shopping and haircuts.  Adam and I both got much needed haircuts today - if you're bored you can check out mine  urlLink here .  Its just about 3 inches shorter than normal (due to summer and stuff).  Don't mind the fuzziness - I'm trying to learn to use PSP properly ;)  Then maybe I'll actually *buy* the program for a change!  In other news - we're finding the really weird thing to have to contend with these days is running into all the people we know and when they ask how "things are going" (meaning the pregnancy) we have to tell them that things are "not going".  Its such an awkward conversation to have - especially with people we don't really know well but we run into a lot and just know who we are (either through Adam's parents or from my work, etc).  Its just weird.  I live for the day where nobody asks me about the pregnancy anymore - I get on better day by day not having to think about it and when people ask - it makes you think about it.  So its all very weird.  Anyhoo, I'm going to go wake up Adam since he's still passed out on the couch (for a few hours now that lazy bum!).  I have to say I miss the smilies from the other blog!  Thats my only complaint :)  Bye!
