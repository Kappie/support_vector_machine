But it was funny because before we got there, we were at Cornet and the guy yelled at Matt for playing too much with the guitar and amp... he said to Matt, "Ok, are we shopping or rehearsing?" It was funny because last time all the girls came to play and they didn't get yelled at and Mrs. Kaiser goes there and the guy's nice to her. Once again, I'm sick of adults hating teenage boys. Ok, so we ate pizza and on the way there we passed this guy that was listening to music and probably didn't realize he was out loud rapping. Dumb gangsta. Then as we entered KB Toys I yelled out "Oh goody KB TOYS!" and this little punk next to his bike around the age of 11 repeated what I said. Little fuck was lucky I was in one of my good moods, or else I would of sent Heaton to sit on him and steal his bike. So Mike and I got free Nintendo booklets with all the new cool games, "WOW!" Some of the games there kick ass on price, their like $20 for like Mary Kate and Ashley...man that game is on my THINGS I NEED list. No but seriously, they had cool extremely discounted games like Turok, Timesplitters 2, some sport games, and the best of all, Piglet's Big Game. I really want those Matrix figurines. They look real like my grandma's fluffy blonde hair is real. Which reminds me Dan's little brother Nick - "Why are your pants all fluffy?" Funny funny Nicholas. NICHOLA! Oh... I mean Ricola. Yes now where was I? Oh yes, in KB Toys Matt found those huge hulk hands and when I wasn't looking just punched me and I almost fell into the display. For me that was the funniest part of the day, Matt with huge green hands and when I turned around to see what the hell hit me I see him all innocent and happy. So I punched him in the stomache, woops. Then we were walking back to my house, and...uh...nothing happened? Ok, saw a spider in my room, me and Mike got all freaked out. I stepped on it after Mike stabbed it off the roof with a meat knife. Yes, sorry, but this is a big thing to me! I HAVE ARACHNOPHOBIA! And that's basically it, they both left, well Mike ate over. I told Mike I was going to bed early but...eh...uh...screw that, I can't fall asleep early. - Just incase you haven't a clue who's typing all these journal entries of useless junk... - Thomas H...and let's just leave it at that.  Holy Crap...I mean HOLY CRAP!!! if you click on sport games...it freaking brings you to a freaking sports website...now I would know if I freaking put that there and I didn't...compy 386, my computer is pretty damn smart to put that useless crap advertisements for sports on my SPORT GAMES!!! It's like...woah wait...I wonder if I type sports it'll be underlined... OH !!!! haha sorry people for confusing you, it's only for people who have Text Lookup that comes with Imesh. OK NEVERMIND EVERYTHING IN THIS PARAGRAPH!!!!!!!!
