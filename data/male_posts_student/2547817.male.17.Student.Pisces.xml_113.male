Only last night through my memory did they begin to be heard. What was she saying? Her hair was damp and bunched up with a pin. Fringe fell alongside her face as she glowed.  You were there too, telling me things unspoken. That which I had wished I had not heard. Silence in a distempered head.  Went to Steph's house last night for my first and their second class party. H.U.G.E. Wow.. It takes quite a while to get from one end of the house to the other. Also, she's got a pool and art and her TV room's a freaking cinema! Literally! As in PROJECTOR!!!! AARRGGHHHHH!!! So what? I'm content with what I have. Am I? Are you?  Was walking home and saw a police blockade ahead. They were checking every car. Funny Shat. Then, a walked down the hill and saw many HEAVILY MODIFIED CARS sneaking off in all directions very very quietly. Haha... funny assed shat! No points for guessing what was going on.  I was thinking about a beautiful girl. She likes poetry slams and literature.
