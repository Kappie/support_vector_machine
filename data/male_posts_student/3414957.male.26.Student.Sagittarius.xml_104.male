I wonder what the world would be like, at least the lives of all that are around me now, would be like if I went away or was never born. It would be kinda like Its A Wonderful Life. So far, I see no real purpose for my existence, except that I am curious as hell about tons of things and I love knowledge and creativity. It must be all the cake I ate today getting me all loopy!!! I will post some poems on Monday after I do a little homey work gee funk.
