Okay, I'll go through the day's event in school, since school is really what this blog is based on. Civics and Moral education was really really boring today, I'd say it's about as useful to learn it as learning yak acupuncture. And isn't what we learnt today about the Total Defense a form of propaganda? The purpose being to unite the people together. It certainly isn't working on me. I rather watch my toenails grow... and play shooting with Li Lin. Oh and today I used one of Jeanie's Babies as a gun, I pointed the "tail" and held the legs to shoot. It even has sound effects, nations shall tremble when I point that gun and it squeaks. -_-; -_-; -_-; -_-; -_-; -_-; -_-; -_-; -_-; -_-; -_-; -_-;  Here's a thought for you 2hians out there. What if beginning of last year, people were not the same people as before? Like for example. Felicia was like Jeanie and vice versa, and Edward was like Joel and vice versa. In that world, Weijin had straight teeth, Li Lin was very lean and tanned, and Ying ying was like what Li Lin is now; white. Then, people like Hwee Kim and Kim N. would be exactly like Havi and Kim A.  If by now you have a clear understand and a vivid imagination, don't you find it weird? I have often played with this idea during extremely boring lessons.
