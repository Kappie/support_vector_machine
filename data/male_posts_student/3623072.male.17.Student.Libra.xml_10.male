Cos we didnt get to do much at all  wat's even worst i should say is bringing my  STUPID ASEAN NOTES  which I need to be prepare.  *argh*     Thumbs Up  during the trip: 1. Chit Chat with my granparents especially my grandma who i really miss the most! 2. Met my Uncle; Azmi. Talked to him about plans of building a website. His gonna help me. 3. Grandma's Home made cooking! *Yum!*   Thumbs Down  during the trip: 1. Taking a COLD bath. *No Hot Steamin Water* 2. Study the stupid ASEAN Notes.   This morning, a frend of mine I dont know but it was a frend, msg me this morning and said Hi! How r u and stuff. But i cant figure out who was it cos most of my frends contact number were all kept in my mobile which is being repaired in the shop. So at te mo' im using my old mobile phone that there was not alot of my frends contact number. So i asked that personn to identify him/herself. And the person replied back and said that "Now ur trying to forget ur old frends and didnt need old frends anymore." What the hell is this? i really didnt mean to. So i tried and explain but after i reply HIS/HER MSG,that person doesnt seem to answer. I really hope that person will understand what im trying to say .   Man! Farah have been in my mind eversince i last chat with her. Cos we both really have something in common and she really do make me happy. I felt like im in love again u c. The problem is I already have a girlfrend and i dont want to have 2 gfs cos 1 is enough. + I dont wanna lose Farah or my gf u c. So guys if u cud speak out and help me. It does really helps!
