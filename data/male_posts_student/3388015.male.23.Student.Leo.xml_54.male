One also removes one's intake of proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, empty and not-so-empty calories. You might be saying, "Hey, isn't that unhealthy, not eating and all?" And I say to you, "Hey Fatso, what are  you  doing this Friday night?" Don't argue with results, people. Luke and I have been on Cindykins for a total of two days and he has lost 15 pounds and I have lost 4. To celebrate our weight loss, Luke, Laura, Linda, and another Luke and I went to the Lake today and ate steak, chicken, and Abbott's not-so-frozen custard. I felt out of place, as I was the only person in the party whose name did not begin with the letter 'L.'  Our picnic at the lake was excellent exercise in snobbery.   [Laura, cleaning up after our picnic.]  Laura:  Is there any more trash around here?  Me:  Are you kidding? They're everywhere!
