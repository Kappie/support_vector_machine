Now, mind you, it was by no means our best performance.  Nevertheless, we did well enough to earn first-division (which is the best you can get), and I couldn't be prouder, both of the song as well as (and mostly of) the players.  They've just been the greatest people to work with: supportive, creative, willing-to-listen, and genuinely enthusiastic.  I really could not have asked for a better group to work with, even those who had to drop due to grade or time conflicts.  Way to go, guys!  But the best part is that we (as in the MHS Wind Ensemble) will be playing  Pillow Songs  for the May concert, the final of the year.  I can...not...wait!  To be able to have your music played by an ensemble is incredible, but to have it played by a full concert band is...wow...there just aren't words that can describe it.  Have I found my direction in life?  Have I found what I want to do with the rest of my life?  Well, one thing's for sure:  Life...is...good :-)
