I applaud thee, Joel, for providing it.  I just went to my third Cubs game in three days.  Although Nomah went o for 5, the Cubbies completed a clean sweep of the hometown Rockies.  'Twas sweet.  In other news, I return from Denver on the 17th in the morn, and if anyone wants to hang out that night I would be more than happy.  But for now, I must bid you OUTS.  (adieu)  Sincerely,  Nomah.
