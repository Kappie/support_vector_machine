Merry Christmas Eve everyone...hopefully you will have a completely uneventful Christmas.  :D   I guess I don't have as much to say as I thought.  Oh well.  Oh, and, Marten, I already do see a psychologist...actually, he's a psychiatrist, so I get meds, too!  Yay!    lol, Nathan, your little silly-thing at the end was the super-greatest.  I love it.  Yay!  Yay!
