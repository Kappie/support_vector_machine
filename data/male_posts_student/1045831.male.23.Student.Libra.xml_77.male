It all started off on friday night.  after a long drive down Paul and I went straight to the bar.  Kristen had other plans which kept her from joining us (these will make you laugh later).  At the bar I begin drinking Pearl in the can which for those of you who don't know is the oldest beer brewed in Texas, and yes it is dirt cheap.  We play pool for a few games while a couple of older ghetto ladies made dirty remarks to us.  ONe of my favorite was when one of them was picking out a pool cue, help it up next to her, Because she had to have a stick that reached her tonsils.  Well I beat paul 3 games in a row and began feeling the booze I was drinking. We then met a guy named Daniel and hung out somemore drinking beer and just being good kansas boys in Texas.  Eventually we decide we want to go somewhere else so I ask the door man and he tells me to go to the "Boom Boom Room," thats right the "Boom Boom Room."  Well me meet people and get shots bought for us and have a good time.  Met an interseting girl named Larimie, but that is another story. Anyhow we go back to Kristens place which is a gated apt. complex so we have to wait for someone to come in so we can get in.  Kristen still isn't home so we go inside and hang out.   I then get a call from Kristen saying I need to go let them in the gate.  I go to let her and her "date" in the gate.  Yet I am drunk and in the mood to get in a fight at this point so when the gate opens I go and open the drivers side door well prepared to pull the guy out and fight him.  (I'm such a meat head)  But when I looked in a saw this weenie I couldn't do it.  I still tried to talk him into fighting me but I offered to let him hit me in the face a couple times first to even it out.  He didn't go for it so I got in the car and just tried to be annoying because I figured maybe it was a blind date and kristen didn't know what was going on.  I thought I would be doing her a favor.. I wasn't..  This was of her own free will..  What a drop since the other guys she has dated.. I mean even from Aaron.  (J/K I love ya Aaron).  Well that is basically the end of the first night except I did get real pissed off for a while but that didn't really affect anything.. it was after everyone went to sleep..  The next day is coming up..
