I love not speaking, I'm quite good at it. Oh people-who-read-my-blog, don't guess that I'm sad. If I think you should know I'm unhappy, you'll get the memo.   A trip to Barnes and Noble again. I got the next book in the Discworld series, Pyramids (already proving itself as golden as its predecessors) and an abnormal addition to my collection: The Annotated Works of H.P. Lovecraft. For those that do not know, H.P. is perhaps the greatest horror novelist that ever oozed from the primordial. I've heard reference to his works in several computer games I notice as well as some movies (Hellboy). Famous authors such as Anne Rice and Stephen King were inspired by him. This is abnormal because I don't normally read horror. Sci-fi, fantasy, and religion tend to be my taste. But if I feel like branching out, Lovecraft seems to be at the top of the horror hill.  Randomness tastes good, even when surrounded by more standard randomosity. I was involved in a "drive-by" of a more comedic sort. People that were there will understand.
