Exams  97.54% in Computing exam... Oh yay... =) Obviously you may notice my lack of enthusiasm. At my school, I don't seem to really have a choice to skip Years for my computing studies, but I am SO far ahead of everyone it isn't funny. *sigh* Time will tell...   Of midnight and drawing  At a few minutes before midnight last night, my dad caught me drawing... Dang eh? The really annoying thing is that I go to bed at midnight, that's  my  time to go to bed. If he had come in only 5 minutes later he wouldn't have saw the light coming out of my room. My dad really doesn't understand that my dad never works out how it's supposed to, and that night for me is the only time to make up for the mistakes of day. Getting better at drawing though. Only marginally, but if I don't have that I don't have anything eh? =)   Commitment of Interest  To make sure I keep improving in my attempt to become an artist (unlike others I do not assume that I am an artist, being an artist is much more than drawing on paper or making a beautiful model)   Every week I shall attempt to produce: * At least one purely original drawing * A 3D artwork * Attempt to write in my blog and come up with some creative/crazy ideas =)   Just a note, I will not be posting everything I write, draw, or render up here. I don't have the webspace for it, and I don't really think there is an audience to be listening.   To want to do so much, and yet achieve so little  I want to write a book, become a traditional (pens, paint, paper) and digital (3D graphics, digital painting) artist, and to be happy, and all of these seem to be out of reach to me... Maybe I am diluting my interests too much... Maybe I'm talking more than I'm walking... Whatever it is, it's not going well... Gotta work on that =)   Wrapping up  Well, it's 9:37 now, and I can feel that my dad's going to walk up to me, try and steal a peek at my screen, and then say in childish tones "Time to go to bed Stephen, without sleep you won't be a good boy..." Either way, I'll stay up quite a bit longer, how at the moment I'm not  exactly  sure, but by the time I finish cleaning my teeth I'll have an escape plan ready =) (dad just switched off the kitchen light, he's coming for me) Nitey nite, before he gets a peak at my screen =)
