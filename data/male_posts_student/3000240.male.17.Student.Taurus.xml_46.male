Reznor's sister, Tera, was born in 1971, and was to be the last child of Mike and Nancy Reznor.  Reznor's parents soon split up.  Tera went to live with her mother, while Trent was shipped off to be raised by his maternal grandparents in the tiny hamlet of Mercer, Pennsylvania.  By Reznor's own description, Mercer was "a nice little picturesque one-horse, one McDonald's kind of town."  By all accounts, Trent Reznor was the typical American youngster raised in the typical American fashion, participating in Boy Scouts, building model airplanes, and skate boarding.  His grandparents would also later put him through the typical childhood nightmare of piano lessons.  Reznor's piano teacher, Rita Beglin, has allegedly compared his playing to the likes of Harry Connick, Jr., though this 'fact' was difficult to verify over the Internet.  In the later high school years, Reznor has been described as being clean cut, handsome, and popular.  Reznor was also in the high school jazz and marching bands, where he played both tenor sax and keyboards.  He was also voted 'Best in Drama' by his peers and classmates.  Actually, Reznor was the absolute modicum of popularity he would later rebel so violently against in the not-so-distant future.  After graduation, Trent Reznor moved to Meadville, Pennsylvania, where he attended Allegheny College and majored in Computer Engineering.  After one year of spinning his wheels, Reznor soon realized that programming computers for the rest of his life wasn't his calling.  So, Reznor unknowingly engaged in the tired cliche of dropping out to pursue a career in music, and relocated to Cleveland, Ohio, to chase the rock and roll dream.  During the early and mid-1980s, Trent Reznor was involved in several small-time, Flock of Seagulls-type bands, including The Exotic Birds (where he would meet his future drummer, Chris Vrenna) and 1000 Homo DJs, which involved Al Jourgensen of future Ministry fame.  Said bands were a continual disappointment to Reznor, however, and he found himself leaving these acts more often than not, his as yet unknown creative outlet left unfulfilled.  During these turbulent times, young Reznor found work programming synthesizers and MIDI in a small Cleveland studio, and it was here that Nine Inch Nails first began to take shape.  A twenty-something Reznor toiled by day at the controls of the studio, but was given free reign at night by the studio owner.  Reznor slowly taught himself the complicated MIDI applications that would allow him to sample, mix, and develop various sounds.  Being free of the typical collaborating (see 'meddling') band mates, Reznor took his time and immersed himself utterly in his work, preferring the isolation.  He was free to express his feelings through an electronic format that was soothing and grating, soft and hard, quiet and raucous.  Being only an amateur musician at the time, Trent Reznor approached his work from the listeners point of view, and developed a work that allowed the listener to hear someone else express their innermost emotions and pain, but in an entirely unique and unusual way.  The result was a collection of raw, turbulent and brutally honest tracks.  The origin of the name Nine Inch Nails has been widely speculated over the years.  Some argue it refers to the length of a coffin nail, while more imaginative souls liken it to the size of Trent Reznor's phallus.  Rather boringly, however, it has no profound meaning.  After tossing around 200 monikers for several weeks, Reznor found that Nine Inch Nails kept ringing in his head.  He has also quipped that it looked great in print, was easy to abbreviate, and "it's a lot cooler name than Trent Reznor."  "It's a curse trying to come up with band names," says Reznor.  It was about this time that Trent Reznor began to shop his demo out to some smaller independent labels.  The 80's were coming to a close, and the music industry was undergoing a subtle shift in trends.  In the summer of 1988, Reznor cautiously sent out about ten, three-track demos to small, independent labels, simply looking for a single 12-inch deal so that he might hone his craft.  He was not yet fully aware of what Nine Inch Nails was, or what direction it was going to take, and he was reluctant to get involved with a label that would want to smooth out his sound into a polished, more palatable brand of pop.  So it was with surprise and some trepidation no doubt, when Reznor received offers from virtually every one of the labels he had approached.  It was at this point that Reznor realized he was on to something.  Trent Reznor settled on TVT records, a record label more commonly known to market albums consisting of TV jingles rather than avant-garde, pseudo-Industrial music.  Nevertheless, Reznor immersed himself in the deal, working with a number of producers on what would be Nine Inch Nails' debut album.  One notable producer included Adrian Sherwood (Depeche Mode, Ministry, KMFDM), who mixed the lead single "Down in It" for the as-yet unreleased Pretty Hate Machine.  Sherwood and Reznor communicated solely over the phone and Sherwood actually mixed the track in London.  The two would never actually meet face to face.  It was this mix that would find its way onto Pretty Hate Machine, as opposed to Reznor's original version, despite Reznor's protests.  While Reznor appreciated Sherwood's mix, it was radically different from his own version, and he protested in vain with TVT to have it kept off the album, but the label would not relent.  This was perhaps the first sign of sour times ahead for TVT and Nine Inch Nails.  Trent Reznor also worked with the legendary Flood, whom he had originally wanted to produce Pretty Hate Machine in its entirety, but due to scheduling constraints and prior commitments, this had become impossible.  "I liked Flood because he's the opposite of Sherwood. He's very transparent. You don't say, 'Hey, that sounds like Flood,'" says Reznor of the legendary producer.  Flood, of Depeche Mode and U2's Achtung Baby fame, was nevertheless able to contribute in a small way.  Several other producers were also added to a growing list, including John Fryer (Love  Rockets, Cocteau Twins) and Keith LeBlanc (Tackhead, Maffia).  It was time that Nine Inch Nails took their act on the road.  Trent Reznor was faced with an obstacle, however.  Because he had recorded Pretty Hate Machine entirely alone ("Nine Inch Nails is Trent Reznor" the album jacket flatly proclaims), Reznor had to assemble a cast of characters to bring Nine Inch Nails' music alive on stage.  So, Reznor gathered some musicians about him, and ambitiously played a few dates opening for the legendary Skinny Puppy.  It was an intimidating time by Reznor's own account.  He felt they weren't nearly as intense live as he wanted them, so after the small tour, he ushered his live band out the door, and collected a new crew around him.  He intentionally looked for young, malleable musicians who would be less likely to voice their artistic opinion and more likely to bow to young Reznor's direction.  And so, Reznor was joined by Chris Vrenna on drums, Richard Patrick (whose brother is Robert Patrick, who played the T-1000 on Terminator 2: Judgement Day) on guitar, and David Haymes on keyboards.  In the spring of 1989, Nine Inch Nails embarked on a tour in support of Pretty Hate Machine, opening for the Jesus and Mary Chain, and quickly followed it up with a spring tour opening for Peter Murphy.  While NIN were moderately well received for fans of Jesus and Mary Chain, Murphy fans were not so forgiving.  Playing small theatres and college auditoriums, the steroid-pumping jocks and Bauhaus-fanatics did not take well to NIN and their angst-ridden set.  It was not until an Atlanta show when Reznor pelted the audience with cold pizza before they actually received some semblance of acceptance.  After throwing corn starch on the audience, smashing a guitar, toppling the drum set, and storming offstage, Reznor was amazed to find the gathered Georgia crowd loved them.  "Forget the music, as soon as they got abused, that was it.  We outsold Peter Murphy on T-shirts," Reznor has said about the show.  Nine Inch Nails would also go on to release their first music video at about this time, the lead track "Down in It."  Produced by H-Gun, the Chicago group who were also responsible for Al Jourgensen-related projects like Ministry and the Revolting Cocks, the video did not initially pass MTV standards and was edited.  Towards the end of the video, Trent Reznor is simply lying on the ground, covered in corn starch, supposedly dead.  One does not see how Reznor 'dies,' nor are there any gruesome details indicating how he might have died, but it was still too much for MTV.  "That implies suicide, and we can't have that on MTV," Reznor has said sarcastically about the cut-job on the video, "but we can have Cher's naked ass."  With the breaking success of Pretty Hate Machine, supported by the albeit edited video rotation on MTV, as well as the underground success of their second single and video, "Head Like A Hole," Nine Inch Nails were beginning to gain steam and gain some notoriety.  So much so, in fact, that NIN were approached by Perry Farrell of Jane's Addition, who was putting together a very eclectic cast of characters for a festival tour labeled Lollapalooza.  Lollapalooza was the brainchild of Farrell, and consisted of a touring package of a wide variety of musical styles, while at the same time offering a venue and voice for political debate.  And so it was that Nine Inch Nails, now joined by James Woolley on keyboards, were squeezed into the middle of a seven-band bill, immediately followed by Ice-T and preceding Living Color.  Nine Inch Nails proved to be a wildcard on the tour, and touring with Lollapalooza undoubtedly set the main foundation for Nine Inch Nails' huge success.  Fans who had never heard of NIN became immediately enraptured when a corn-starch coated Trent Reznor took the stage, smashing guitars, keyboards, and band mates alike.  Rather than banking the pay checks that they were receiving for their performances, Nine Inch Nails instead put aside only a small kitty and invested the rest into ten guitars per performance.  Ten guitars scheduled strictly for destruction.  And so, each night when Nine Inch Nails took the stage before an audience of people who had never heard of them, Reznor would do his best to destroy each and everyone said instruments, whether it be by smashing them over the stage or his own band mates.  James Woolley found this out the hard way at the performance in San Francisco, California, when a piece of keyboard, destroyed by Reznor, flew up and hit him in the head, drawing a torrent of blood.  Oblivious, Reznor played/thrashed on, until a stage hand alerted him to the fact that medics were on the way to tend to the injured Woolley.  Guitarist Richard Patrick suffered a similar fate in Boston, Massachusetts, where Reznor tackled him over some monitors, leaving Patrick writhing in agony.  This was just after Reznor had soaked the amps, cables, and monitors in water, of course.  Fans at Lollapalooza had no idea what they were witnessing, but they damn well knew an exciting act when they saw it.  Nine Inch Nails' and Trent Reznor's antics went so far as to draw the attention of then mega-rock star Axl Rose, frontman for Guns N' Roses.  He invited Reznor and mates to open for them on the European leg of their tour, including an opening slot at the legendary Wembley Stadium.  NIN accepted, though they would grow to regret it.  Reznor went full-tilt in their first performance, "but by the second one my tail was between my legs," Reznor says.  Greasy-haired, mullet-wearing metal heads apparently could not digest Nine Inch Nails so-called 'synth' sound, and Reznor and company found themselves ducking cheap whiskey and beer bottles thrown at NIN in appreciation.  "It's one of those things when you think it might be a funny idea then you realize, when you're up there, maybe this ain't so great," said Reznor.  Needless to say, Reznor turned down Rose's offer to open for the final American leg of the Gunners tour.  After nearly three years of touring, Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails finally decided to take a break.  Reznor wanted to begin recording anew, working solely with Flood, but he had come to realize that Nine Inch Nails' relationship with TVT Records head Steve Gottlieb and the label was at an impasse.  The next several years would find Reznor engaged in a bitter legal dispute to free himself from the constraint of the absolute antithesis of artistic freedom, while at the same time recording new, even more angst-ridden music in secret.  Nine Inch Nails had been born and unleashed upon an unsuspecting world mired in musical mediocrity; but at the same time, their future was shaky at best. xBuBzx
