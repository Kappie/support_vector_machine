I remember an old friend Shawn, who was my best friend from about 5th grade through 7th, was in my dream. So was Annabelle. I don't remember what happened exactly, but I know there was a good deal of betrayal, and when I eventually woke up it felt like I had been feeling it for a while. I remember seeing Annabelle and Shawn, heads leaned against each other speaking softly. It didn't make sense to me that my best friend would now have anything to do with her, so I asked them what was going on. Annabelle replied that "Well, you were arrested. You've been gone a long time." That's about the gist of the dream. So today I have a perspective on how things with Annabelle got as bad (and probably worse in many ways) than they ever did with Amber. Betrayal is a traumatic experience, especially when the person you trust repeats what she knew had hurt you before while insisting that she never would. Anyway, this blog is not about that, but a good starting point.   What's on the soundsystem?  Kanye West,  Jesus Walks
