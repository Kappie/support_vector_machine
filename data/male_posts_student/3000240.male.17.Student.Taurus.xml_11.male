I see people who used to have their rebellious streak fade to dust and turn to the sellouts I like to call townies. Now I'm not saying all townies are bad people (take my friend Ian for example) but I'd say, whilst yes I'm horribly generalising here, that most are shallow, big headed, narrow minded individuals who have a warped view of what the modern day English language. What's more many few see to evade the evil clutches of the repo men or seem to navigate there way around a decent roofing company (bad attempt at a joke I know). I can't say i'd like to force my views upon others on this matter, but surely there is another way to live out the "most important years of your life" for sure.  Anyhoo, they seemed to have found a new planet today, the 1st for 73 years. I'm sad I know I view this as an important day in my life, but it's amazing what science finds nowadays. College was ok but I'm increasingly finding even with people for compay at lunch, there's fuck all to do most of the time, unless you sleep on the couches, or go to Wimbledon or Surbiton at lunch, which can cost loads . . .
