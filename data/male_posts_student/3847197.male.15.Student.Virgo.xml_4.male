    
       Man my wallet is full of nothin' but moths.  I need some serious cash.  I'm gonna start looking for a job today, so don't expect me to write too often.  Summer has been flying by and I've got alot of goals and dreams I'd like to accomplish during it.  I'll fill you in when I'm not busy >.  That is all.
