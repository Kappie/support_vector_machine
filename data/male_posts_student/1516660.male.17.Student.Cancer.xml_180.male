At 8 leh, my friends are preparing to go school le (for some, started their prac!). And I just woke up only! Muahahahaha! So shuang ar!! I want to take taxi one...but in the end, I decided to take bus (what a sorry decision! I shoulda took a taxi! tell ya why later!). So, before going, I studied another 2 chapters of Bio (and another chapter on the bus. I fianlly understood ultrafiltration!). I stepped out of the house at 10.10am.  Woah! I walked to the 913 busstop. See quite a number of people holding Bio textbooks. Ahh! Their surname must have started along the letters of W, X, Y or Z. We are always the last ones! I see them holding notes to study. I didn't see any practical workbook. I think our school is one the rare ones to order prac workbook fro students! Okay okay....took 913 bus and arrived at the interhchange at around 10.25. Woah! Wait for the 962 bus for 15 minutes! So horrible! I thought I am gonna end up late! A very unfortunate event happened on the bus (which makes me regret NOT taking a taxi). You see ar, a large group of people came up the bus in the bustop opposite Sembawang MRT. Two seconda later, I detected a very pungent smell. A smell of faeces, actually. Woah! The smell grew by the seconds. And my stop is a torturous 3-stops away! I felt like gagging...but I decided to tolerate and just hold my nose. I suspect it's coming from an elderly man, who is standing quite near me. When my stop is coming, I decided to move to the rear door. The smell weakened, but it's still there (which proves my guess correct!). Woah! Everybody on the bus was holding their noses...buay tahan! When it's my stop, everybody rushed down man! Woah lao! I shoulda taken a taxi to school!  I arrived at school and went into the art room. All my three friends were there already. Woah! There were notes on the board, so we went through lor. Mdm Ho came in and explained everything on the board to us. She then sat down with the 4 of us and discussed la. Not about bio though! HaHa! We talked about Prom Night (ahh!! Wendy die le...MdmdHo say got. No la Wendy! No need tio fulfil your promise la! Just joking with you only la!), about JCs and so many things. Me-ow meow!   At 11.50, she led us up to the Bio Lab. Woah! I see the lab tables quite empty one leh. So little specimens! When the exam started, I flipped through the exam paper. It's very unexpected lor! So little experiments and so many theory questions! Such a dissappointment. Under strict regulations, I am not supposed to moan about my maths skill. So, I won't. There are a lot of maths calculation. Yeah. There's an expeiment we've done before. The holding leaf under water one. Woah! I just recorded what I remembered from Chua. HaHa! In the end, everybody said it was easy. Ha! I just felt dissappointed lor. Dunnoe from what. Being too easy that I made a lot of mistakes? Or tough maths questions? I am such a crazy cat.  I went up to class to take some worksheets and meet my friends. In the end, me, WQ, Janet, Gloria and Chun went to KFC. Me and WQ shared a meal. Chun kindly offered to change my coleshaw. So good! Must smile at her more often!   Eat eat until 3. Arrived home at around 3.30. Then, I bathed until 3.55. I then hem-hawed for a while, dunnoe whether to do a-maths or SS. I decided on A-Maths in the end (I am quite confident of SS....Last Friday I didn't study...but I found the test quite easy....or issit because I've done the test already?). I studied the chapter on Co-ordinate Geometry. I did problems that covered almost the entire syllabus. Meow!! I did problems until what? 5.45? Then, I called WQ and chatted with him till 6.30. Chat chat chat.   I ate dinner (yummy yummy frog legs!), watched Holland V, PCK and Lydia and came online. Ah!! I am very short of time revising. Going back to school on Wed and Thurs and wasting time doesn't help. Sigh!! I wonder if I can finish revising Physics, E-Maths and SS by 3rd Nov. I hope so!   I think I stop blogging le. See ya tomorrow (or not...since tomorrow's Charmed day).Night blog!
