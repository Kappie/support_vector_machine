It seems I'm entering a new relationship, as well as a new way of going by things.  I like this alot, and I'm sure it will last.  I havent felt this excited about someone in a long time, and that gives me huge amounts of hope.  Well, my eyes are starting to hurt due to this bright screen so I'm gonna end this.  Peace
