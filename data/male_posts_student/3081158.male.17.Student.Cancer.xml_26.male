I'm trying to get everything working and stuff, but I've got a three day meet this weekend, so it's going to be tough to get the updates in. In the meantime, I recommend you go look for your own media (or make some):   urlLink Infoshop  this place is the shit for anarchists and stuff.   urlLink Indymedia  this is  the  independent news source. tons of stuff from ordinary people all over the world. These places have loads of news:  urlLink Reuters   urlLink Al Jazeera   urlLink Washington Post   urlLink NY Times   urlLink The Nation   urlLink The Economist  (maybe a bit of capitalist edge at times, but good objective news)  urlLink Yahoo! News  is good, but their  urlLink AP section  is best:   urlLink The Guardian   urlLink AlterNet   Blogs to check:  urlLink This Modern World  is a neat little thing http://www.tothebarricades.tk/ is sean's site. very good.  urlLink anti-war blog.  not much more to it than that  urlLink AMERICAblog: Because a great nation deserves the truth   Ummm... I could put more, but I don't know if anyone has the time to read all of that stuff. Be sure to check it out. Woot! Taking back and improving our media one post at a time! (sounds odd when I just linked to a bunch of mass media/ corporate giants' sites, but there's nothing wrong with using a free resource)
