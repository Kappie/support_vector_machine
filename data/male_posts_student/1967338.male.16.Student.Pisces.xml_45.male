Corn Maze... Cosmic bowling... All the pizza and soda you could ever want... Its not really much of a lock in but I went last year and it was awesome.  The Dungeons and Dragons thing sounds pretty cool even though I have no idea how to play, but oh well, I'll learn. Since I'm so bored here's some li'l pictures:  =^.^= maow!   -^.^-)>   (>-^.^-  t(-^.^-t) finger givin' kirby man!!
