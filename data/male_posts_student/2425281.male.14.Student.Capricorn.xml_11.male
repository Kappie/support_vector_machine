I can safely say that all those below and above me will most probably be using horrible truncations and acronyms that should safely stay within the boundaries of a chat program window, and never more. I do not care how absolutely cool it may be in writing in inane and mindless gibbers, as that would really show how education is being wasted. Also the only way I could become cool would be by living inside a fridge for three months.  If one observed the frequencies of my posts on this blog, then one would be able to find out that this is only the second post so far. It is mainly because of my general style of blogging that I believe would make it stand out too much from the average blogger crowd. That is why I mainly post in my own blog, which is untainted by grammatical mutilations and second-rate spelling.  So, if anybody wants to see some real fevered ranting using correct English and suchlike, then www.wellerzheng.blogspot.com is where most of it can be found.    This post was not shameless self-promotion disguised in any form. Nor does it contain any blatant subliminal messages, although you may get an urge to join the Navy. Only sick twisted conspiracy artists, such as those claiming that table tennis is not a sport and NSB is lesser than James Ruse, would spread such profane rumours. golb ym daer golb ym daer golb ym daer golb ym daer golb ym daer golb ym daer golb ym daer golb ym daer golb ym daer.
