WE WON THE WAR! I'M A JACKASS!"), and overall crappy acting. since when is "you did it." "no, we did it" and neo and trinity's "let's see how far we can go through the movie without showing one recognizable human emotion" revolutionary filmmaking? in addition, the entire machine v. man battle was a waste because it took away from the meat and bones of the matrix, which was being in the matrix. duh. and they even ruined that with the flood of special effects that made the final "big battle" seem like some sort of giant videogame fight. o yea, where was the payoff in the movie? when *insert random major character here* died? or the ending? which still had no actual explanation/conclusion and included no characters from the FIRST movie. maybe i expected too much, but matrix revolutions was a total disappointment.  and oh yea, our yahoo badminton group is so dumb. our captains are fine, but i resent the coach's assumption that they're the only ones capable of doing team duties. and alex and jennie lee evaluating the jv team? right.
