I have a terrible headache and my neck really really hurts. Sure, I've woken up in this condition before, but this time I didn't drink a thing last night. Kiel and Justin are both sick, and I think that I must be getting sick as well. Not cool, not cool.  Crystal left me a note on my car last night. Made my day, actually. Sigh. Will probably write again later...
