Everything that I have written seems to be a worthless tautology that does not deserve a place in any paper. All of it is meaningless, useless, futile; for all of it does not really convey what I want want to express. It appears I am only seeking to impress. It is all an act of obstentation.    I tried following Ma’am’s teachings, but the results were as destructive as my previous writings, probavly even more. They were trash. Thus, I found myself in doubt and uncertainty, not knowing what and how to write.    Am I merely a barbarian who does not know how to write a decent material (specifically a precis)? Why have I not the ability to express myself in a simple but beautiful way? What is wrong with me? Am I even a writer?    By doubting my writing abilities, I have doubted myself, my purpose. For a long time now, I have considered the pen as my primary instrument to serve God and to fulfill the purpose He has assigned to me. The paper has served as my sanctum whenever everyone was at a distant place I could not reach. Words have comforted me, reminding everytime that I am someone. But now, with all that Ma’am said, I have no knowledge and wisdom to know and understand my purpose. I have lost my singlemost refuge. And I have become no one.    I am grounded.    Humbled.
