Michaelangelo Signorile: "Stop misusing cherished gay words. Calling Condoleeza Rice 'fabulous' is like calling a root canal exciting." Florent Morellet: "Invading Iraq was one thing. But if you are going to save the world by invading other countries, do it for the right reasons at least. Invade Iran for the caviar. Bring down the North Korean leader [Kim Jong Il] for atrocious hair. Attack France to stop men from carrying those little clutch purses." John Erik Karkula: "[Give him] word-of-the-day wallpaper for his bedroom."  edit 6:34 PM: if anybody saw the blackout edition of conan last night...conan is GOD. he's even too good for his own theme song! "those are the letterman fans, the affluent ones...they've got cars..."
