And I'm not going to go.  I had high hopes of catching some of the short films and maybe a band or two, but a number of things (including the ridiculous price for every event) have led me astray.  I was spoiled when the  urlLink Austin Film Festival  came through last October, and my department showered me with a free pass, mainly because this festival is a great one for screenwriters.  I attended several discussions (why are roundtable discussions always complete crap?  Two people who write for a living discuss their work like they're on  urlLink Charlie Rose , and they're asked the most ignorant questions by the public in attendance.  It's mass orgies of idiocy like this that make me glad I went to a  urlLink small college , where at least the orgies were smaller), but went to film showings every night.  And a lot of the films were terrible; I saw five films, and only enjoyed two.  But that was alright, because the films were free.  Had they cost $6 per, times would have been much tougher; you depend on a blurb and star power to figure out who you're going to see...every once in a while you get lucky and find one of your favorite directors has a  urlLink new film  out, but usually you're resigned to guessing and hoping you're lucky.    This festival is a great place to meet American indie directors, the exact kinds of people I want to talk to and sell my scripts to.  But therein lies the problem; I have no product I feel is adequate to sell.  Sure, I wrote  Three Strikes , a well-written piece about the paradox of the American Hero and threw in a nice Greek Tragedy subtext, but it lacked the breath of life that good films have.  My newest film,  Faith  is my attempt to infuse that life into a subject.  But it's not ready.  And I don't want to just latch on to some director without having anything of my own to reference and try to pitch.  So I work rather than play.    Buddhism is such an attractive religious practice.  I never really studied Buddhism nor the Zen side of it, and I still haven't read  Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance , but studying the practices today, I can see a lot of value coming from it.  Is this an attack of Christianity?  Not at all.  But I've always had problems with Christianity, and everyone who has ever tried to answer my questions has given me the same rhetoric.  Problems in religion are perfectly fine, but when the religion sells itself as complete, the quandry is tough to ignore.  I don't think I can ever leave Christianity for a number of reasons, but ideas like Phil Jackon's Zen Christianity are incredibly interesting.
