We got there and we couldnt start rinses right away cause the hot water wasnt on.. so we had to wait for that. Then I went and let 5 cows in.... but 6 came in by accident. So we were trying to get her out. Well, lets just say that didnt work too well. 2 more cows came in behind her. I was holding 1 off from going in the door to let the other 1s get out and i was just tossed aside like a sack of potatoes. That was just the begining. I dont really feel like typing so i wont go into detail. Then i got home and my mom and dad wanted to go to mohegan sun(the casino). I was like no u cant go u guys own me like $175. My mom was like well i payed u back $110 just now so let us go. So we had an arguement. She took me to get a game that i wanted but i still feel like shit. I dont understand, if my mom and dad dont have money, why would they just through it all away at a casino. Well, i need and answer to that question. I dunno. Well now im depressed(yes, im a very depressed person) and im tired. well i dunno what to do and i still dunno an answer to: if gina likes me or not. i dunno.....
