I'm going to love and cherish my wife as long as I live whether homosexuals get married or not.  I don't understand why the Republican Party thinks that it needs to deny rights to a small portion of the population, especially a group that is already being treated poorly.  Love is a good thing.  A state recognizing love for some, yet not for others is vulgar and offensive.
