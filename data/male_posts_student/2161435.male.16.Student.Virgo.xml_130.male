My dad is just making me some cofee. What a nice chap he is.  Anyway, I noticed this morning, that since I put my hotornot pic on here, my rating has gone from 8.9 to 7.7. I do not know who I have to thank for that, but I  will  slap them. They clearly don't like Orlando Bloom. God I am rambling. I should really stop now, but when I do, I will have to start revising, so I'll keep on a bit longer.  In 48 hours  I will have just 1 exam left. Yay! Here are my exams: Tuesday morning: Seperate Sciences Wednesday Morning: History 2 Tuesday afternoon: RE that is a total of 4 hours left. Thats all! Yay! Woo! etc.   Thank you for taking the time to read all that. I appreciate it.
