She approaches the stunned guy and asks, "How long has it been since you've had a cigarette?"  "Ten years!" he says.  She unzips a waterproof pocket and pulls out a fresh pack of cigarettes.  He takes one, lights it, takes a long drag and says, "Oh, that's good!"  Then the woman asks, "How long has it been since you've had a drink?"  Trembling, the man says, "Ten long years!"  The woman unzips her waterproof pocket on her left sleeve, pulls out a flask and gives it to him.  The man takes a long swig and says, "Man, that's sweet!"  The woman then starts slowly unzipping the front of her wet suit, looks at him seductively and asks, "And how long has it been since you've played around?"  The man, with tears in his eyes, replies, "Oh sweet mother of God! Don't tell me you've got golf clubs in there!"
