Most of the 98% of  urlLink Windows  users say that they don't use  urlLink Macs  because of compatibility (where only few of their beloved Windows programs are not usable on Macs.) I don't think that was among the things that bothered  urlLink this man  but he was definitely bothered. Don't get me wrong that I dislike Apple Computers (because I am about to switch, as I like them more than windows machines), but this is one of the funniest videos I have ever seen. This man speaks of his experience on the Mac very badly, but it is funny because although he "dislikes Macs" he still uses them and even edited the video on a Mac.  urlLink Check it out here  , and   enjoy .
