Looking for a new source of political satire?  Check out  urlLink Mark Fiore's  cartoons.  Sarcasm  flash animation at it's best. Or, how about The K Chronicles from Keith Knight. They're on the Salon.com  urlLink comics page .  Yes, I know you have to go through ads to get to it.  It's called capitalism.  It's what pays for fine work like this to be available to all us kiddies at home (still for free, might I add). While you're there, check out Carol Lay's Story Minute comics too.  She is a very cool person.   *HACK* *COUGH* Allright, back to the iron lung with my feeble ass.   urlLink email  me or somethin.  Don't you go changin', hear?
