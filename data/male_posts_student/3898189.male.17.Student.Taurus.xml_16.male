That was fun...I have been deep in thought so I got some stuff off my chest that I have been thinking about alot lately.   Greg had also invited me to the beach yesturday were I spraned my foot skimboarding. But it was still fun.   So...Last night I came home around 10:00 and then I talked to Rhae for alittle while. Then I whent to bed around 11.   When I woke up this morrning I noticed my foot was badly bruised...so today I have spent most of the time playing Pokemon. and trying to stay off my foot. ( I cant wait to go skimboarding again)  (^_^)   Well that is all I have to say for now....
