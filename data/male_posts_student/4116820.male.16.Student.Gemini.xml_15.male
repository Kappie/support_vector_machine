I had messed up bad and started to shave it all when the phone rings. Well now, I wasn't expecting a call at all, but got one. My sister handed me the phone and I said "Hey, I'm shaving my head.". They reply I got was "Hi, this is Donna from JcPenny.". Argh! The one place I'd like to work I gave a really shitty first impression. Well wish me luck on my interview.
