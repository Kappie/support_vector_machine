I had this revelation for a seven-minute film when my grandmother and I were at the coffee shop this morning.  It'd be a feel-good movie, where the fat kids win.      *Someday soon I'll write a chapter about my father and his love of going out to eat.  Seven times in the past 48 hours he's called me, making sure that plans are still on for our dinner reservation tonight...do we still plan on meeting Loathar at six?  Dinner at 7?  What if Loathar is late?  Will he have to wait until 7:30? Is Frank going to be ready...will he have fed the ducks?  This is why I eat Panda Express and drink High Life.    *I need to forget about the 18 year olds at the pool.  I had the pleasure of listening to one talk on her cell phone.  When the body is loud and the voice is quiet, you can at least pretend that she would be intelligent.  You can forget that you crave conversation, not just the fun of a rompy-poo.      *I counted seven specific worries from my grandmother within an hour today...my dad's drinking, my car's oil leak, Frank's partner Rudy working on a ladder at a house in Andreas Hills, the coffee not prepared correctly, the car backing out of the driveway too quickly, my dad's car acting up in Banning, and Frank's bagel browning too quickly in the broiler.
