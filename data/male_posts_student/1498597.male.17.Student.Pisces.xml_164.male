Have you ever had this feeling...where you stumble upon somethin' you'd long forgotten...and yer like,"Holy shit, how could I forget about this!?   This  was so awesome!"  Well. if yer able to identify with the emotion I just described...I'm totally havin' one of those moments!  Ya see...um...I kinda like...alright...not "kinda"...I just really fucked up and skirted the details on bloggin' and what not and as a result, this blog has been left untouched, unrevised, and thus, became unnoticed.  Hey!  Its kinda like that food you had last weekend but forgot about and then find like a week later and its all..."Bleah!" and you don't wanna touch it and stuff...What the hell am I sayin'?  The scary thing is...I dunno...even more scarier is that I asked you guys!  And you guys are total retards!  But seriously, I just got totally lazy and shit and I didn't have as much freedom with my time as I did before school started.  If you hadn't noticed, the number of new blogs posted stopped an  extremely  long time ago, around the time when the school year had begun.  I would get urges to blog all year, but then I lose that determination to blog a couple of minutes later...in fact...meh...I'm losin' interest again...eh...We'll see when the need to type up and post up journalistic gold comes back to me...Until then, go fuck yerselves...More to come...!
