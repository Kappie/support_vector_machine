I figured I'd start a blog to help keep myself occupied and also to help me ignore the country music satellite station playing here at work. I am not a country fan.   There is always music playing on the overhead speakers here at work. It's supposed to help our morale as we deal with irrate customers here at our customer service center. I can tell you that it doesn't work very well. It's not that I hate music. I love music. I just don't love the music I'm forced to listen to on a daily basis.   Usually (four and a half days out of five), we'll listen to either the 80's station or the 70's station. The same songs are played all day every day. Finally, after nearly a week, someone will change the station to a decent one with a good mix of music. You'd think that would satisfy everyone. Unfortunately, you can't please all the people all the time. Inevitably, someone (who hates modern music) will switch the station to the country station. On Monday, the cycle will start all over again. To quote the great philosopher Garfield, "I hate Mondays."  ____________________________________________________________   On another note: In a turn of wicked events, I finally watched  urlLink Kill Bill  Volumes 1  2. I probably shouldn't have watched them, but I did. I liked the music from the movies so much that I bought soundtrack. Amazing! I think those who were surprised to see Quentin Tarantino on  urlLink American Idol  the other week should take a listen. This man knows his music!   Speaking of  urlLink American Idol , people are really worked up over America's  urlLink decision  to vote off Jennifer Hudson. I think I was as shocked as the rest of the country. I was even more shocked that the three best performers were in the bottom three. I will tell you now that if either John Stevens, Diana DeGarmo or Jasmine Trias wins, their record sales will equal those of  urlLink Justin Guarini  (FYI: Record sales were dismal and his record label gave him the boot. He found out he was dropped while reading a magazine article. Sad). Maybe I should start voting-- or not. I don't really care all that much. The show is entertaining, but not entertaining enough for me to actually by any of their records.   Word.   UPDATE: The satellite radio station has changed. We're now listening to the 70's station. This place is too predictable.
