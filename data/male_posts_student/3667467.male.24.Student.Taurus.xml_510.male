I got as far as saying Hello to the kid (seven feet tall) when he pulled out a butcher knife and stabbed my hand and slit the back of my neck.  During my second visit he only stabbed me in the hand.  In another dream Joe, Ed, Dawn and I visited a whorehouse in a home in Williamsville and walked around.  Twice.  I am nothing if not persistent when I'm asleep.
