A few days before I left, I decided I'd do some portraits of the dogs and get prints to give to my aunt and uncle as thank-you for-letting-me-stay gifts. Here's what I got:   urlLink      Sphinx  is a photo of Boston in a very typical pose. She always sits on top of that couch, and wags her tail like mad whenever someone's in the room. To get a good, sharp image I cut her tail out of the frame and use a very fast shutter, to reduce blur - it still took about 5 shots to get a sharp enough one.   urlLink     This one,  Boredom Sets In , is my favorite of the two portraits. Pugsley, as she's called, turned out to be a very uncooperative subject. Whenever I put my finger on the shutter-release button she seemed to deliberately look away - at the wall, the ceiling, anything other than in a direction that would work for me. I ended up putting my finger on the button, waiting for her to settle into a typical, adorable pose and then holding out my left arm, snapping my fingers to get her to look where I wanted while taking the image. I think the time spent was worth it, as my aunt and uncle were extremely happy with the photos.
