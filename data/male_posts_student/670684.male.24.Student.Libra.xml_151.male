No bones are made about looking to see the inner beauty of a contestant; it's all a celebration of the physical form, except rather than celebrate, there is much scrutiny.  While the people on stage are willing to put themselves through it (so I have no remorse for them when they're sad that they're not hot enough), it's amazing how many people are dying to judge others.  Of course, I was a proud surfer of  urlLink Hot or Not , so I am basically a hypocritical SOB.    Another beautiful day today.  I wrote ten pages, cooked myself some fish, and met a girl with the most beautiful wavy hair I've ever seen.  I'm working to stop overanalyzing present situations, so I went over and told her she had beautiful hair.  She was flattered, which was good.  She had very little to say about anything, which was not as good.  But I'll always remember the hair.
