I'm a student at the local High School...not a very good school, mind you, but I learn things there! Like don't eat ANYTHING the cafeteria gives you!...Wait, that was middle school...blah... Anyways, I'm 15, and a Sophmore... Right, weeelll...I'm gonna use this Blog as my itty-bitty space to write me feelings, and other stuff(maybe short stories, maybe poetry...depends on how I feel) Ok, this is evilmac, and I'm gone! ~Evilmac, God of Forums
