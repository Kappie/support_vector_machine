This is what I must call everyone today. Today may be Michelle's last day on Big Brother and so this task is to honour the Geordie lass who should be the winner in my eyes, even if she is a crazy stalker!          Not much to blog about at the moment, I'll be back later though to blog your freaking brains out!
