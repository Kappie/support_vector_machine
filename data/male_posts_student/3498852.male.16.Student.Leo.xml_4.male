I need to rock out more though... 2 cans of Red Bull made me shake, but didn't do much to make me go all-out.  Oh well.    I had fun.           I got a new cat...  His name's Beaker... he's really tiny and he's like 2months old or something like that.   All I know for sure is that he's 100% Grade A Psychopath.   and he rarely ever sleeps when he's supposed to. :P      Well that's all for now... I'm gonna go swim for a little bit.
