There was one time, where I like this girl. Her name was Michelle. All my friends influenced me to ask her out, since they believe that she liked me too. I asked her, but I got turned down. Her reason for turning me down was that she only wants to be ' just friends '. And now my friends still make fun of me about it. The second one, Kimberley. I started from scratch. I barely knew her but I decided that I would get to know her better, and thus resulting her to like me. And if she did start to like me, which I thought she did. Then I would ask her out. But she turned me down saying ' I don't even know you .' So in a span of 3 years I got rejected twice. So my confidence with girls is not that good. Now I'm as smooth as rice when it comes to talking with girls, but when it comes to asking a girl out I'm not.  Now this girl Ellie, is amazing. She is the most out-going person I've met in Canberra. There's something about her that separates her from all the other girls in my school. So maybe that is why, I really want to ask her out. But every time I think that I made some progress, there is always a doubt that she might not even feel the same way about me. *Sigh* I'll continue to try, since I don't believe in giving up. But the thing about asking her out, I'm still not 100% sure about it.
