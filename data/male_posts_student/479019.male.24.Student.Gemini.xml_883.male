BJs or D for happy hour anyone?   Someone on  urlLink xanga  commented on one of my posts that Iraq is essentially the same as Vietnam. I would totally disagree with this based on body counts of American soldiers, and the level of military mobilization. This is due to the lack of a draft and the fact that a good chunk of our armed forces are scattered in military bases around the world. However, I do think that Vietnam and Iraq are useful analogies. The "War on Terrorism" is an ideological battle not unlike the Cold War, and Iraq is the physical manifestation of the conflict of ideas and beliefs. It is the American government once again intervening on behalf of democracy, justice, and capitalism.  Inhye and I went up to Ithaca (Cornell Art Musuem) today, because she needed to see a video on  urlLink Nikki S. Lee 's work for a paper. I think the work of Nikki Lee is fascinating; however, I think I'm much for critical of it than Inhye. A big part of my criticism comes from the fact that in terms of subculture, my own self identification makes me think that her posing as a certain types of people does not say anything about the fluidity of identity, culture, and space. Yes her pictures of her being punk, hip-hop, yuppie, skater, etc. are convincing as stills, but what about issues of authenticity? She challenges authenticity on one level, but at the same time she reaffirms authenticity in terms of stereotype and perception. Inhye and I actually disagree on a lot of theory. It gets funny when we discuss spaces of restiance... but I'll save that discussion for another day.  Ok I need to run my partition program overnight, 'cause it takes f*cking forever!!!  Hmm... what should I make for dinner?  ***
