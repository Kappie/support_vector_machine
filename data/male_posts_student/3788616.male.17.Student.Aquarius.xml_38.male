CHINESE! haha... yup, unbelievable coming from an ACS boy, yet... so very true... certainly, the paper wasn't what i expected it to be... i expected it to be much harder! haha... but alas... it failed to meet the mark... hmmm... nevertheless, i shouldn't be so full of myself, less, i screwed up and did badly... haha... but a guaranteed F is on the cards too! haha... a 50-50 chance to pass Math... but... still... *crossing my fingers*  oh well... hmmm... i saw Kelly today... and well... i don't know... i really like her alot... yet... i can't simply shrug off nor deny my feelings for Meiyi... haiz... somebody help me?! i don't know... cause, both mean so much to me... oh well... i pray for strength and a clear mind... to decide on who, soon...  okok... got to go! haha... don't think i'm going to study tonight... even if i do... it's minimal! haha... keep going on!
