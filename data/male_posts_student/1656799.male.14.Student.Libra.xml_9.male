I was a bit reluctant at first to let other people whom I do not know see my blog, as this is the first time I've done so since I think in the autumn of 2003. I might add a picture to my profile, that is if I do conjure up the bravery to do so.  I've deleted all the entries before the last one as I feel they sounded a tad bit dull to be honest, I think most of them followed the pattern of, "I'm so bored, there is nothing to do" when I know well that I didn't even try to find or do something interesting atfer complaining about it.  To make this entry feel worthwhile, I'll leave you with two pictures that I took during my school day yesterday...        Toodles.
