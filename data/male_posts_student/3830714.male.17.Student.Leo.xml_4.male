But after adding my listening and oral exam, i got 100 out of 200 marks! Laughing out loud! I passed! Horay! I passed my chinese common test! I don't know why Tan cb not happy for me... weird. Anyway, i just found out that for AO subject, 45-49 is C6. That means that i don't have D! Haha... This is my final results:  Subject       Grade Mathematics C: C Physics:     : C Biology:     : C Chemistry    : E Chinese      : C5 General Paper: C6  Yuk has been sick for 3 days now... I think it's because of stress that makes her immune system go haywire. I hope that her fever will be gone soon. Don't you think that her absence makes us feel that something was missing? Maybe not for you but it is for me. Furthermore, this is examination period, i am worried that her fever will affect her performance in the chinese exams.   Yuk, hope you get well soon! I miss you!
