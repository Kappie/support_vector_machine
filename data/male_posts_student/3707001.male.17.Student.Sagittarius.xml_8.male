Everything was going just how i imagined it before this morning.  I felt as tho i was in complete control.  I was an ocean liner taking a cruize of the Caribbean... everythings going good.  How wrong i was.  What seemed like an ocean liner was really me drifting in my dinghy.  Small and fragile, where the smallest gust of wind could top me over.  Well today, i hit more than a gust of wind, i hit a storm.  I was just cruizing along, having a friendly convo.  This person wouldnt believe me about something i said, so i reinforced it with the best example i could use, not even considering the possibilites or the consequences.  Well the last thing that i could've expected to happen happened, creating a storm of emotions.  No details here, but i simply could not find the words to say.  Did i stop? No.... i asked another question, and got the only fitting answer to finish the convo.  At this point, it was too much, I had to leave, I had to run away... even if it was just for a moment. So i signed off and went upstairs throwing myself and other things around my room, trying desperately to cope... finally i just sat on my bed, back to the wall, and put my head down.  I was so lonely, i needed some1 around me, so i called up my friend and we went to MickeyDs. I called him up half way to his house, he lives on the way so it only makes sense i pick him up.  As i saw him, i put on a fake smile and acted like everything was ok.  I wanted to tell him everything, but i was happy enough just having some1 to talk to about anything.  When we got there, we were about to order breakfast, but while we were thinking they changed to their lunch/dinner stuff.  We were both to shy to order now, so we ended up just sitting in MickeyDs just chilling, talking to some1 else who works there.  LOL, one of the employees tried to sell us a coupon, it was good too, i woulda bought it if i had money.  Big Mac combo for $3!!! Anyways, we left, went to Mr. Sub next door to get some healthier food.  My friend ask for my recommendation, i said Louisiana Chicken.  We both got one, and i got an assorted for my mom (i knew she'd be mad if i didnt get her anything).  On the way back, i asked a simple question, something to help me out.  Sadly, he gave me the exact opposite of what i was thinking.  All that did was make me 2nd guess my morals and values.  On the other hand, the food was good.  Finally, i got home.  I wanted to talk to that friend, but he/she was gone.  It's funny, i ran away before, and all i wanted to do was talk to this person now.  O well, that email will have to do.  On the bright side, something tells me that it might not be as hard as i thought... if all goes well.  Yes, u cant tell through this very unspecific blog, but it was a storm.  Although it didnt seem like it at the time, going through the storm was all worth it... getting thrown around barely surviving in my dinghy was worth it, to see that beautiful sunset in the end...
