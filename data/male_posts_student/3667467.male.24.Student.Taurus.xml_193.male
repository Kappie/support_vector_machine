This should be easier...  Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, North and South Dakota, Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, California, Colorado, Wyoming, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Alaska, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Iowa, Texas, and one more! Arkansas! Ha HA!
