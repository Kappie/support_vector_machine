Was Skimming through the pages of the Latest "India Today" Issue , when an article on the Indian Economy caught my eye. From a perpetual Borrower in the past , India has now transformed into a Creditor to the IMF. We have pre-payed a $3 Billion worth of Loan to the World Bank  have also lent monetary assistance to Countries like Brazil  Burundi . So does this mean that India is on the slow growthpath towards Economic progress  Independence ??
