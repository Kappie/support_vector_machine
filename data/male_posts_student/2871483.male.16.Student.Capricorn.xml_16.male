Had a funny experience in the little McDonalds there.  There were about 15 employees crammed into the place which, if you've seen airport restaurants, is really freaking small.  We then took a puddle jumper (small plane) into "Yuma International Airport"!!!  It has six gates, and is roughly the size of the mini terminal in LAX.  Got Rally burgers, drove a golf cart, and saw AWC get their asses kicked in Basketball by the Gauchos.  Now, I must sleep.  More later.
