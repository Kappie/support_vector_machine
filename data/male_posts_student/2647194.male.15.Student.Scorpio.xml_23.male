You would be too if you did everything I did, and still managed to do as well in school without going crazy. I don't know what it is lately, but it seems like I need to cut something out of what I do. Or maybe there's a gap that needs to be filled somewhere. I don't know what it is, but something needs to be done. This is apparently what winter does to you.
