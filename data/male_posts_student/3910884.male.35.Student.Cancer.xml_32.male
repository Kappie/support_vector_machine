Special guests today are Denise and Tito from Ayala Foundation, 'Aggie' Aguilar a leadership instructor, and of course the Aeta tribal councils from the neighboring sitios and the COOP members living in Maruglo.    The next 3-days will be spent on leadership courses, management training, and program accountability. I think someone had mentioned out of school youth but I'm not sure about that. All in all it should be pretty cool, especially if it stops raining...    [ Later that day... ]    Participated in a leadership meeting with the local barangay cooperative that specializes in loaning money. Capital interest for this group was started through the Aweca Agro business to start the COOP. Aweca kind of reminds me of a local Angeles City Ayala.     Word of the Day:      Bayanihan : helping each other out without compensation.    Woah, flash back time (this is when my vision gets all wiggly as I reminisce).    Just flashing back. I think my first real kiss, I mean real passionate kiss was a stage kiss.    LOL! I had to rehearse the kiss and I was so nervous during rehearsals because I had never kissed a girl that way before...    But when it happened on stage, it seemed so right. It happened smoothly. I totally forgot about the audience and was enthralled by the feelings both physically and emotionally...    I have to smile because the first real kiss, passionate kiss, was shared on stage with an actress and an audience, and the stage crew...    The way my lips touched hers, then slowly our tongues touched and ewtwined. The moment seemed to last forever and at the same time only for an instant...     I didn't realize I was holding my breath and I let out a sight when our lips parted. My friends in the audience, being the dorks they are, started 'ooohhhing' and 'aaaahhhing' and giggling. But actually I didn't care. I had this big smile on my face and the experience was beautiful and I was just enjoying the after effects...    Not sure what brought about this memory but it was a happy memory and is one of many that I will cherish as long as I exist...    [ Even later that day... ]    Wow, the leadership course/class was pretty cool. Understood some of it but it was mostly in Kampampangan so I wasn't too familiar with everything but atleast some of the words looked familiar and some of the aspects looked similar to what I learned, read, and experienced myself.    It's been raining on and off all day so I'm not totally surprised that some of the Aetas show up around 5:00 PM. They'll spend the night for the class tomorrow. They're motivated to take the class and have been probably walking in the rain the whole day, the whole way...     Side note:     Funny that the government warnings here to safeguard your health (eg. the warning labels on packs of cigarettes) are in English. Not sure how many Aetas can read English (or other people in the Philippines for that matter). Warning labels here should be in Pilipino so everyone could read them (if everyone knew how to read).
