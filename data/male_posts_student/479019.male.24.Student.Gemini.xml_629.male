That plancha off the couch onto the hardwood floor seems to have reaggravated my back... or was it the one man mosh pit? Hey, it's 'cause someone was dressed up as a luchadore and when Albert sees pro-wrestling imagery of any kind he really gets into it.   Hmm daylight savings?  The cool think about Kennedy Fried Chicken is that it stays in your system for while, thus you're not super hungry 12 hours later.  Ok time to shower, get some work done, and then finish watching  Gangs of New York .  **
