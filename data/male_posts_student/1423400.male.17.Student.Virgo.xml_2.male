Oh yeah, bye-bye iRiver mx-400, those negative comments and ordering online, with all those support problems swayed me to look at the new Sony and Panasonic models, and for 174.00 that new Panasonic SL-CT700 slim mp3/cd player will soon be mine, ohhh yeah! (that's in canadian dollars too!) So I figure instead of paying possibly over 300 dollars, just to get a fancy remote, case, and car kit, I could spend like half that, and at the same time pick up like 5-6 new cds.  Daaaaaaaaaaaaaamn, I hope musicfest gets put back on track so we can go to Toronto, its the last trip i'll have with the grade 12's.    I really miss my sweetie... I just miss her sweet self so much its frustrating.  Getting back to seeing how hard it is to find a girl makes me appreciate Carrie even more that we're not together... I need to find a way to be with her again.  Unfortunately unless she has a car soon, I won't have a car until July or August.
