Now, I've been suckered by internet scams before, so I promised myself I'd be more skeptical in dealing with this, but finding a reputable  urlLink Engadget article  assuaged my worries slightly. So, I dived in to  urlLink www.freeiPods.com  and decided to give it a whirl. Registration was fairly easy and standard - email address, password, home address, etc. After registration I was greeted by about 10-20 "Please Complete Our Short Optional Survey" prompts. I clicked "No" on all of them, it doesn't have any impact on registration. After that, I was asked to supply the names and email addresses of 5 friends. I skipped this step, and proceeded to the "Complete Offer" page.    Here's how it works:  There are 9 "Offers" available. They all involve some kind of payment, except the AOL 9.0 with Musicnet free trial and the RealRhapsody free trial. You'll still need a credit/debit card to give them, but no money changes hands as long as you cancel your account before the free trial is up. I tried signing up for both AOL and RealRhapsody, and found the RealRhapsody offer to be much easier. You sign up, download their software, then cancel the account online and uninstall it. AOL makes canceling much more difficult, I had to call Customer Support and deal with a perky, brainwashed sales rep with an annoying southern accent trying to talk me out of canceling.   This begins  The Hard Part : getting five other people to sign up and complete an Offer.  You're on your own from there. Have fun.    urlLink FREEIPODS.COM      Don't take my word for it, though - do your own research:   urlLink The Original Free iPod Guide   urlLink Freeipods.com Economic Analysis   urlLink Better Business Bureau - Freeipods.com/Gratis Internet    Side note: I'm interested in the legal status of this enterprise - it's obviously a pyramid-type scheme, but if it's working and people are actually getting their iPods, what's the problem?      info.link:  urlLink http://www.freeiPods.com/   [Listening to: American Woman -  urlLink The Guess Who  (03:48)]
