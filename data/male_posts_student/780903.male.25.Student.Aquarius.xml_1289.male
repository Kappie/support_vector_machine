We had an all-day law firm social event that involved a wine tasting and a vineyard and then a hanging out / eating lots of food afternoon and evening.  Discoveries:  1. There is this weird thing called "ice wine," made out of frozen grapes, that has the consistency of maple syrup and tastes really, really terrible.  Even if someone charges like $35 for a bottle of it.  I don't drink very much at all, so maybe I'm just missing the point of this thing.  But I really just didn't get it.  2. There are lots of ways to grow grapes.  They showed us 8 different ways.  You don't want more details than that, trust me.  Although if you're having trouble sleeping....  3. Sunscreen: good invention.  I'm glad I remembered to bring it.  4. Water: good invention.  Although it makes you pee a lot.  5. Food: good invention.  Although sometimes enough is enough and it just gets silly.  6. There is a company called "Rent A Tent" and they do exactly what it sounds like.  Do people grow up dreaming of being in the tent rental business?  7. Glassware + Pool = Broken Glass + Bare Feet.  Just a cautionary note.  I actually don't think there were any incidents.  But I could imagine one.  8. "Rent A Tent."  Really.  I can't get over that one.
