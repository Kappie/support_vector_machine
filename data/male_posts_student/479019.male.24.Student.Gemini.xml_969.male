I went from an 800 rating this morning before work, to 730 after work. I need to be caffeinated up when I play. Actually I need to be caffeinated up for pretty much everything... everything that doesn't require me to be liquored up that is.  Before work I dropped by Radio Shack to pick up a fuse for my FM transmitter, because I keep fucking up the settings and blowing the fuse. I ran into Ryan there, and after some chatting it was discovered that his girlfriend works at the Crossroads Diedrichs. I mentioned this to Anna, and she says she might know her. It's a small world here in The 'Vine.   Now playing:  The Bouncing Souls  - Kids and Heroes  Yes The 'Vine is so small that it turns out that Abby lives a mere few minutes walking distance from Brandon.   More fighting in Iraq, violence in Sudan, and even kids getting killed on the streets of America. What a world it is we live in! Is this the best of all possible worlds? With all the progress we as species have made in art, science, and technology, we still let a large chunk of the population. Over a billion people on this planet are living on less than $1 a day. How many of these people are children who won't live into their teenage years due to starvation? How many of these children will be drafted into the military like in Uganda, or be trained to be suicide bombers like in the Middle East?  Now playing:  The Offspring  - Jennifer Lost the War  I'm tired and thirsty right now. I think I'll have some water and then sleep.  ***
