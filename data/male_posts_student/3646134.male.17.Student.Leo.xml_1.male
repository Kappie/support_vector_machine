Big n sweaty (our affectionate name for the maths mechanics lecturer, Judith) rang my mum yesterday to say I haven't been going to maths... my mum's response was "Exams are over, sorry Judith... you're just too damn fat!".  Looks like I wont be taking maths next year :| although it was very funny!  Last few days I've been on drugs :p the scary scary things that cure my back pain but make my vision go purple and give me hallucinations! :s  Yes that pink elephant was trying to steal my left leg!  :$ so the back pain's been gone :D but knowing me, I'll twat it over again doing something dull!  :p  My neighbours moved out today, at last!  I've had a bit of a vendetta against them... they kicked my cat once... 7 speakers, a subwoofer and a powerful amp... up against the joining wall till 3 am :) all I can say: Tim wins :D  Today, Jonny B wore kinda stupid (very amusing) shorts!  Whenever he moved too fast, they'd compress his groin!  So Matt was trying to make him move suddenly all day :p so harsh!  And Wilson was doing his manwhore act and ignoring us... so we were throwing things at him, all simultaneously texted him saying "you suck, we hate you!" and slapping him etc until the girl he was trying to impress just laughed and walked off :p (he does hav a g/f!) and then Yumi got offered a lift home and there were no seats left in Jonny B's car... so he was far from impressed lol (but we were happy... she's a really lovely person!  RHCP concert 2moz :p so everyone off to that!  Then planning the beach on Friday!  busy busy busy!  Tim
