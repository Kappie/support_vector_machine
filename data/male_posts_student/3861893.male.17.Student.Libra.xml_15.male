If you watch soccer regularly, you would probably have realized that the winner of the Charity Shield will never win the Premiership. That means Arsenal will not win the Premiership this season. I repeat, Arsenal will not win the Premiership. If you think that I'm talking nonsense, here is the proof:  In 01/02, Man Utd played Liverpool in the Charity Shield. Liverpool won. But, Man Utd won the Premiership.  In 02/03, Arsenal played Liverpool in the Charity Shield. Arsenal won. But, Man Utd won the Premiership.  In 03/04, Man Utd played Arsenal in the Charity Shield. Man Utd won. But, Arsenal won the Premiership.  In 04/05, Man Utd played Arsenal in the Charity Shield. Arsenal won. And you know the rest.  Need I say more?  Anyway, today is National Day. Here's a cake for Singapore.      Don't know why but the song "Home" keeps popping up.  Whenever I am feeling low I look around me and I know There's a place that will stay within me Wherever I may choose to go I will always recall the city Know every street and shore Sail down the river which brings us life Winding through my Singapore  This is home truly, where I know I must be Where my dreams wait for me, where that river always flows This is home surely, as my senses tell me This is where I won't be alone, for this is where I know it's home  When there are troubles to go through We'll find a way to start anew There is comfort in the knowledge That home's about its people too So we'll build our dreams together Just like we've done before Just like the river which brings us life There'll always be Singapore  Btw, watched Singapore Idol just now. The host was Gurmit. Was so funny. Some people just don't mind embarrassing themselves on national television. Haha. There was this guy who sang the song Lemon Tree. The way he sang the song, it was clearly evident that he was trying to be Singapore's version of William Hung. And mind you, when I say this, it is with all due respect to William Hung. He was so action-packed, swinging his hands... Nah, its just another failed attempt.  Then, there was this guy who sang some dumb song so softly that the judges couldn't even hear. When he finished the song, he asked the judges for comments. Dick Lee had this very amusing statement to say, "How can we give you comments when we can't even hear you sing?" Haha. Boy, this guy was damn persistent that he continued to sing even when the judges told him to buzz off. Was so entertaining.  There was another guy who kept asking the judges for permission to do the slightest thing. "May I have the permission to..." "May I have the permission to..." Was even more interesting when one of the judges told him, "You have all the permission in the world..." Haha. But, I think the best part was when the judges gave their comments. Ken made a tongue-in-cheek remark, "May I have the permission to say that your singing is horrible?" Was damn funny...  I guess this is the best part of Singapore Idol. The entertaining part is always when there are a lot of lousy singers who want to have their faces on national television. After that, it wouldn't really be entertaining as there isn't really anything to laugh at. Nonetheless, its nice entertainment. Rock on!
