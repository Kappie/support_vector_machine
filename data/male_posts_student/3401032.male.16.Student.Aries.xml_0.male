I woke up this morning, Friday, and my little sister is still asleep. My parents forgot something after they left for work this morning, so they came back home, beating on the door to wake me up. I let them in and then tried to go back to sleep, but couldn't, so I got up. I took a long shower, and then I got on the internet. DId you know that the New Yahoo Messenger is finished Beta Testing? That means you can download the whole thing now. Go to http://messenger.yahoo.com to do it. It is really cool. SO, I was experimenting with my avatar too. For thos of you who don't know wha an avatar is, it is this little person on Yahoo! that you can customize to look like you. So, when you chat, people can kinda know what you look like, unless you are a real perv and you are a 40 year old man with an avatar that looks like a 12 year old girl. Ew. Gross. So, right now I am listening to Beyonce's "Naughty Girl." Good song... "I'm feelin sexy...I wanna hear you say my name....If you can reach me.....you can feel my burnin flame......." Really good song, EVEN THOUGH I think it is directed towards the female community, the remix w/ that guy is cool. Excuse me, I mean KEWL. Anyway, today, my 20-something year old cousin who just graduated college and is finally home for a while is taking me to play tennis. She is really good at it, and I suck at it. Hopefully, I can learn a thing or two, sense [or since, whichever it is I don't know] I bet my friend Shyla that me and Hugo would play tennis next school year. So, I have to learn how to play tennis over the summer, and I have to be good at it. Okay, now Britney Spears's "Toxic" is playing. "...it's dangerous.... I'm fallin.....There's no escape, I can't wait, I need a hit, Baby gimme it, ure dangerous, I'm lovin it....." That is another good song. Destined to be a classic. Better than that "Everytime" crap she is currently singing on TRL and MTV. So, I still don't know how I promote this site or blog or whatever it is called. I would really like some feedback but I don't know how to get it. Hmmmm. I wonder.... Well, for now, I don't care. According to my site or blog statistics, I am the only one who has viewed it. That means that I am really typing to myself, and as I mentioned earlier, THAT freaks me out. But, I am going to continue 'typing to myself'. "Intoxicate me now...with ure lovin now... I think I'm ready now....." Good song. Now, Eve 6's ......Oh crap, hang on, cuz my new yahoo messenger just finished downloading......OK. Anyway, now Eve 6's "Think Twice" is playing. Good song. Okay, I just finished installing it. It is no different from the Beta version that I have been testing. That's good. Anyway, my wrists are getting tired from typing, so I am going to leave now. Later.
