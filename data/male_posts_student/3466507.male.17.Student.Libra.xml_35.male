I can be very observant and see someone from head to toe and make judgements in a flash, though I am trying to change that. I have been proven wrong too many times.  When someone does something nice for me, I am sometimes suspicious of what they might want from me. Some people appear to be very nice, then ask back for favurs, as if I am obliged by their earlier help/gifts to help them. Why is this so? Shouldn't this be sincere? I never expect anything else from other people when I help them....  That applies to most people I meet, the somebody something nice thing. Some of the people i have met have since then gained my trust. Why am i feeling like this? It is as if I'm so afraid of being hurt, yet, I can't remember being hurt in that way before, as in the opening up to people and getting hurt way...
