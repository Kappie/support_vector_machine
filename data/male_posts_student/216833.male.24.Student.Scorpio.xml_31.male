Pinback was a little disappointing, they rocked, but alot of their songs were on 'crack.'  Super fucking fast.  I bought their 2002 tour E.P. and I have listened to a little bit of it.  Sure enought, penelope is fast as hell on it.  I was real impressed by the bass player, mad skillaaazzz.    We had a sad attempt of passing out flyers at the show, alex put some on one table and I put a few on the other.  We are gonna need a bottle of B.O.L.D to get some flyers out to people.  After the show, I kinda gave mimi directions home and I hitched a ride with alex and eric up the TLP(where alex works) to work on some more flyers for MELANGE at insomnia.  We cut out 11x17 portions of that brown paper roll sheet stuff and ran it through a color laser printer.  I really like how they turned out.  HOLY SHIT, im crazy and its 4:30 in the AM.  Yep, we were up at the office till some time after 4:30am and somewhere in all that mix i totally lost my mind.  I was dancing around the Mat Room shouting "melange" in a fake as french accent all at the same time waving my pretend ribbons around in the air.  I think they were red and purple....haha....french people rock!  I crawled and falled out of bed around 10:30 this morning, feeling like someone at taken a tire tool to my knees.  I had to make my way up to work to change out some tapes for the weekly backups of the AS/400.  I got that finished pretty quick and headed back home wishing I could go back to bed.  mimi went to work around 1pm and I was sitting around fight with my self over going to school.  I didn't want to, I hate that place, I always leave confused and pissed off at the people who work their for being idiots.  I took my books and went the opposite way from school.  I went to the Mall. I passed out a few Melange flyers and put one up in Fast Forward there.  Those kids were really cool and asked me a few questions about it.  I bought a messenger bag, I can't find my old black one, lost i suppose.  I can't get the cat piss smell out of my old faithful backpack so I found a bag I liked and took it.    "Shit, I guess I'll go to school!"  I went and it wasn't bad this time, I met a new guy there, he was really helpful.  He seemed to care at least, so I am gonna start going there a LOT more.  I am ready to have something to show for the money I've spent.  I'm back home now after about 2 hours of going over custom subnet masks, and IP Routing, RIP.IGRP. ARP. etc.......  I'm going to Denton tonight to see a friend I havn't seen in a while, maybe play some pool and shoot the shit.
