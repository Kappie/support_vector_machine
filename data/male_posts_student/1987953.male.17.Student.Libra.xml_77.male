The senior prank consisted of having dead animals planted in different spots all over campus, including a dead deer hanging from the flag pole in the front of the school. Apparantly, the five seniors involved were Titus Bickel (son of Pastor Bickel, the religion teacher), Dan Szumla, Gordy Griffin, Tim Watts, and Mark Kammerer, all students I went to school with. In fact, Mark was a friend of mine then, and teammate on my freshman baseball team. I knew him well. From what people tell me, and what was said on the news, my other former classmates are angry that they get to graduate with them and that there is no punishment. I guess I would be too!  About MY graduation, it was really cool. When I went across the stage and got my diploma, I had to flip my tassle. When I flipped it, it fell off. I had to put it on off the stage before I sat down. It was embarrassing. Some other people had tassle problems too, like it wouldn't flip, or they forgot to flip it. Either way, it was really funny. It's kind of depressing, because several people I got to know well and like, and not long after, I leave and I may talk to some of them through the summer, but realistically, I will probably never see or hear from any of them afterward. The same thing happened at BLS. I talk to very few people that I went to school with. Well, "that's the way the cookie crumbles" I guess.  Well, I'll blog you later! That's all from the newly graduated Mike!   In Christ, Mike >
