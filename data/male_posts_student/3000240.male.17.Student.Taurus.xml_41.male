So this is my theory in my current thinking climate (which let it be known changes on a daily basis).  I see many really quite attractive people at college. There's only a few I'd safely say that I fancy as such. Take one person for example, they're not pwahhhh and they don't like to flaunt what they don't genuinely think they have, which is a refreshing feature for me to find attraction in, as it safely delves away from what I'd usually be attracted to. The person too is also quiet and anyone could tell, if they met them, that they sway away from attention full stop. They are really "pretty" or "cute" and go around they're daily ramblings with a certain elegance and style mainly associated with the majority of people the same age as them. This is something I have always really quite respected in a person.  Shame my end of the bargain will never be nearly up to scratch. Shame. It's not like they're someone I can't stop talking to about absolutely everything, and they don't particularly blow my mind as such, however it would have be nice to have something stable, or just something for that matter. It's been so long since, if ever, that I've had an exclusive relationship with anyone. Sad I know, but esteem, confidence and attraction et al is never anything or will never be something that I'll have in abundance, so I'll just have to lie in my cave, contempt with my lot, until I drag myself to reach the phone book looking for a decent counselor to "re-enlighten me" and give me a "re-birth" in life.  There must be a million people out there just like me (my sister most definitely included there . . . . . . HA), waiting for just something at least, and I guess we find at least someone who is the great love of your existence, but God its a long time waiting, a very long time indeed. xBuBzx
