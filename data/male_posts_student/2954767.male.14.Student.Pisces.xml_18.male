HOLIDAYS!! hehe.. now.. let's get this thingy updated.. ok.. so.. i spent like 4 to 5 days at shehana's place cos her parents are like overseas.. so they entrusted her into my hands.. hehe.. i'm very responsible ok??? so i stayed there from Sunday to thursday.. had plenty to do cos we went out most of the time.. either that or we slack at home.. it's kinda fun.. kinda like a slumber party.. ;) but on tues, we went for the class chalet thingy.. poor luke.. he must have lost lots of paper(money) cos he was so the one to book the chalet. he must be coerced by Sebastian..hehe. abt 8 pple didn't pay up.. and i'm beginnin to suspect someone.. hehe.. so basically at the chalet, we had not much to do.. jus laze ard.. didn't get to go to the theme park cos it drizzled on the first day.. then the second day we didn't get to go too.. cos the stupid netball gals foiled my plans by suggestin cycling.. poor shehana, she didn't get to do it for the first time.. so we went home.. i was very tired.. cos i didn't sleep much.. i was like 15 mins knock out then i'm back on again.. it's very uncomfortable.. particularly on a one seater sofa.. then later in the mornin at abt 3 plus??? i dunno which kind soul gave up her place ( a two seater sofa) to me! and i slept like a baby till 6.. hehe.. but that *kind* soul gave it to me cos she found a beta place to sleep which is one a 3 seater sofa!!! that woman! hehe.. niwae, was grately to her.. y'all know why i didn't sleep in any of the 2 rooms? cos one was occupied by the hoard of netball girls! (humpf!) and another was occupied by XY and YC.. hehe.. 2 of them.. who'd bear to disturb them.. hehe.. and i discovered many secrets at the chalet... particularly personal ones.. who'd would have thought that a chalet could be so fRuiTfUL?? hehe.. so i went home on wed and was almost drawn by fatigue to sleep on the mrt on the way home.. but due to the music blastin in my ears, i was kept awake.. and many pple kept lookin at me and shehana cos the music was so loud that i think they could hear.. hehe.. and shehana was like bobbin her head and me tappin my foot to the rhythm.. quite an enjoyable ride home.. so the next day i went home and was immensely drained.. emotionally, phycically and mentally.. lol... pretty dramatic.. i really miss *him* alot.. i only saw him 2 times durin the hols.. once was when he's in for basketball prac and another was when he was playin basketball near he's area.. hmm.. i'm so missin him right now.. he's so hot and cute.. haha.. lucky me.. he also had a class chalet goin on.. and poor him.. he's didn't sleep for the whole night.. haiz.. wish i could see him now.. i'm signin off now.. see y'all back in school.. GC forever.. ;)
