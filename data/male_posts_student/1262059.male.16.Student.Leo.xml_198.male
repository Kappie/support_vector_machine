Buddhism day was rather... interesting..? well, i'd say it was something worth going to. The video at the beginning actually had my attention for 2 hours... without me falling asleep... which is saying something. Well, the Romero video last year caught my attention too... but yah. Pretty good feats for educational videos.    Oh, Keanu Reeves starred in that Buddhism Video... lol, i swear, the Matrix had lotsa ideas that were similar to "Little Buddha" (that's the name of the video). For instance, there was an awakening (aka awake from Matrix). There was a search for the reincarnation of the Buddha (aka "the One"). Instead of stopping bullets, Keanu Reeves stopped a bunch of flaming arrows.   His acting style is about the same too... the nearly emotionless, short-sentenced person. The only thing that was missing was some nice martial arts =P   Speaking of which, martial arts was my first workshop, out of 3. It was ok... none which can be used in real life, and the person that's  supposed  to be doing the workshop was absent. Next, it was Buddhism symbols... since it was "mandatory", i didn't have much hope for it, but it was actually quite interesting. Lastly, there was food... not really interesting... but... food! i mean, c'mon... free food.    After school, i went down to anime, but then, karen was like stressing over newspaper, and she was working on something that was supposed to be my workpile  anyway  (she took charge of it after it became clear we needed a better article). So i decided to do my share of the work, and spent around 2 arounds working on it.   Managed to get it done too... hopefully, newspaper would be ready for tomoro. Mike Sitayeb was saying how it was ok .. but karen was like "noooo... not good enough... change stuff"... so i stayed an extra hour till i got her i-give-a-damn-anymore approval ^^ *sigh* i'm easily satisifed... i'm not suited to become a layout artist. Anyhow, i really feel sorry for karen, who had to stay behind for god-knows-how-long to supervise the rest of the layouting. And for Mike, who i know also put in long hours for the paper.   Such hard-working people our editors our... they do the thankless, creditless yet necessary work...    ~Chronos
