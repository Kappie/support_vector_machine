It was so warm in the hall..i was perspiring like hell... my seat was in a place where all the fans are far from me... found an i.c. on the desk.. hahaha... donno who ... a j2 girl... after gave it to teacher. I chose the question using elimination.. but after 15 mins.. i found out that i eliminated ALL the questions!!!!!!ALL so hard!! those very general questions... although teacher said it can do-able.  but don think so after attempting. I chose questions 5 in the end... "What do you look for in a celebrity?" The only questions which i have sufficient points to write 4 content paragraphs... Hahaha.... quite smooth.. hope i can pass too! But i know veryhard... Aj got a really fresh way of submitting our essays... it's like voting for a referendum like that... row by row, we'll walk up and put our essays in the respective boxes of different questions... I think a teacher is in charge of each question... hope the teacher can be lenient lor... the most popular question is question 4-- What makes a good leader? Hahahaha... i wouldn't want to do such a question.. :P sure fail.  Then can go home le... short day. Tomorrow even shorter!
