But today I did see how lucky I am. I guess this has been a culmination of my summer. Because while some people worry about how to pay the bills, and when the next paycheck comes, I am worrying about which shirt to buy at abercrombie. I bought the blue one by the way. Maybe I'll go and get the other one too!   You people are going to yell at me for saying what I'm about to say. But its how I feel, and it might have something to do with what I just said above. A friend was telling me about a friend, who's kinda poor and stuck in a rut. But I was comparing my response to her response to his situation. Gosh I hope this makes sense. Her response was that he deserved (for lack of a better word) handouts. While my response was that he should get a better job. You see here's my theory. Everybody in this world is in the position (in this case socio-economic position) that they are in because of the choices they have made. In this person's case, he didn't go directly to college from high school. I know you are probably thinking 'big deal', but I say that is why they are in this situation. They screwed up along the way, and while it is great that they are trying to fix the problem now, the damage is done. This is just how I feel. See this is the way I run my life. I think every step through as to how it will affect me down the road. I don't feel sorry for people who don't go to college, or who don't work hard (although my definition of hard work is different than some peoples). So don't hate me for my point of view. I just think that this is the way the world works. Your past always comes back to haunt you, and you pay for every mistake. But if I felt sorry for everybody in a bad position, I'd be a real sorry person.   New Subject: My plan is in full swing. Which is good. Because it is.  Today in John's Life: I woke up soooo early at 10.00 and left to go tanning at noon. I got there like ten mins late, and was scared, but they didn't charge me for being late. So all was good. Then I dropped something off for my mom at her old work, then I went and picked up Alex at her house. We went over to St. Peter's to visit her grandma in the hospital. I hate hospitals, but her grandma wasn't actually like sick or hospital-ish, she looked good, so that is good. And the hospital didn't smell like urine. So props to the hospital. Then we went and got Subway, and drove for like 20 minutes into the countryside and ate our Subway on the slide at South Bay Elementary. We had to jump the little fence to get in and Alex was wearing a skirt, so that was mildly entertaining. I still do not know why we drove all the way over to South Bay to eat. I've never even heard of South Bay before today. It was fun none the less. Then I dropped Alex off back at home and came home for like an hour. Then I went to the KAP graduation picnic shindig. Today Alex and Emmy graduated from KAP. Which is a big thing for them, cause they've been doing it for all of their life. When I graduated last year, it wasn't a big deal for me cause it was never a big part of my life, but it was a big part of their life. So I saw them graduate. My mom called in the middle of it and says I need to know six colleges that you want to go to right now for the college advisor who we pay way too much money to to get me into college. He wanted to know today. Apparantly you are supposed to know this already. But then again, according to him, I need a 1400 on the SAT too. Whatever. I have to register for the Oct. and Nov. SAT tests tomorrow....I hope I don't forget. tomorrow being today because it is one am already. I should sleep...thats all I've got for y'all...  Good Night/Morning (if ya wanna get technical)
