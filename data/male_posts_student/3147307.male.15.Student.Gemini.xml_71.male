My campaign speech: "Good morning Falcons, my name is Nathan Hart and I am running to be your Sophomore class secretary. Freshmen, we have had a great year, but we can make the next one even more memorable. As a class officer, I will encourage school spirit in academics, at athletic events, and in other school activities. Some of you may have only seen me once or twice in the halls, while some of you I have talked to many times. Freshmen, I leave you with this; have a heart, vote for Hart. Thank you!"
