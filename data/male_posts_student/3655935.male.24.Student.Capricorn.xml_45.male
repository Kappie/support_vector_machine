As I mentioned in  urlLink Confessions of a Teenage Rockstar (pt. 1) , I was in a short-lived band called  Sweet Debris .  Today, Iâ€™d like to share another brilliant song I wrote.  This one, entitled " Getting Over the Hill ," is the way I dealt with being rejected by a girl named Hillary (notice the pun).  Once again, this is for your pure entertainment.   "Getting Over the Hill"   Vs. 1  You told me to call you, then I get your machine.  I hear the same tomorrow, and do the same thing.  I ask you why you never call me at home.  You say it's all my fault, the you leave me all alone.    Chorus  You push  The blame  You ruin my name  You show no shame    Vs. 2  You watch me fall, watch me cry  Watch me die, I'll be alright.  I'm passing over this insignificant hill.  You don't even know, you made my heart ill.
