I didn't post because I was sick of writing for a while, i spent 2 and a half hours last night writing a tour journal and posting it(and some pics) on the web.   urlLink My Storage Bin Site(for now, a place to store my Complex pics and the Tour Journal)   The tour journal is long as hell, as it encompasses my whole day of getting ready for the concert, during the concert(spoilers by the pant load), and after the concert.  For a lot of you, you won't ending up seeing the tour, but not to worry- i'm preordering the DVD today which is the whole concert live, filmed at NextStage in Grand Prarie on August 12th and 13th. Wheeeee!!  Hmm... so what's happened this week...  It turns out that this is TEKS(it was TAKS, and before that TAAS) Benchmark testing week... but the only class to do it so far is English. And it SUCKS!!! And boy, does it suck hard!  Dan and Binh got to miss school 3day to go play tennis, which is good for them because today was boring as hell.  History= reading Comp Sci= boring programs Maff= Inverse Matrices.  All easy junk. I could have skipped and not had any detriment to my education today.  Of course, it doesn't matter.  Meh.  Double Meh.  I just realized that I have nothing to look forward to anymore.
