Yet here I am, Sick... I missed my speech class but I emailed my teacher to let her know and tunr in my homeowrk..  I got to go to the doctor to see what if I need some medicine or what...  Ahh but on a good note I did find the perfect graduation present for Toms'..  It's probably the most perfect thing I have ever seen but don't expect me to say what it is here..  no surprise equals no fun.. lets just hope I'm better by thurs for the Jason Boland concert...  Ok well I'm gonna make like Microsoft and split..  God I'm a loser..  Peace out...
