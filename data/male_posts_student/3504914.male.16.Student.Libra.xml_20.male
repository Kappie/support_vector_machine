By saying “Watts up?” (HORRID)    Flash File of the Day : http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/avocado.php (Fishy lasers, err)   Saying of the Day : Quid Pro Quo- Meaning, in Latin, “Something for Something”. Used when people are exchanging information.    Rambles : Oh I just love Latin; all the words just sound so much devilishly superior to any other language. I love English, Latin, and German (I love their swear words). Otherwise I have odium for language; I’m ineffectual at recalling stuff. Same reason I hate math, too many fucking formulas.   Well, today was just dandy, it suited me fine because nothing happened. Right now I’m downloading shit from Fileplanet. Too bad I don’t have a membership, otherwise I wouldn’t have to wait minutes upon minutes to simply corroborate that I want it downloaded, and then wait hours upon hours as they actually DO download. Ah well, pays to be economical I guess.   I found beef jerky today, proper beef jerky at that. Good job Dammo, pat yourself on the back.   Finished reading  Hannibal , and I have to say it is millions of times better than the movie. Go read it; I swear you’ll find Dr. Lecter to be one of the most fascinating characters ever created.
