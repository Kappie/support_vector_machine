By the time I'm an adult, I won't be able to use the phrase, "the good ol' days!" Everything just seems to go down now-a-days. I rarely ever have a great day. A day where all of friends don't have anything to complain about. Some things just are stupid, and I wish they didn't happen, but it happens, and we need to live with it. I'm sorry for my fair share of stupidities, I know I've messed up.      So, anyways, life sucks a lot. Or am I the only one to notice that?? Sometimes my face gets tired of smiling, but I'm going to keep doing it, because I'm good at it. Don't yell at me for faking emotions, you do it too. I just have a good game face that makes it so you don't know unless I want you too.      And I wish I had more time to read, I love reading, but I can never find the time. I need to start puttin aside about an hour of my day to read. Reading is awesome, anyone who doesn't like to read is probably illiterate. I don't really have much to rant and rave about, I thought I did, but I've been    listening to music, that's why it has taken me 50 minutes to write this. Music rocks!      Change has a considerable psychological impact on the human mind. To the fearful it is threatening because it means that things may get worse. To the hopeful it is encouraging because things may get better. To the confident it is inspiring because the challenge exists to make things better.--King Whitney Jr.
