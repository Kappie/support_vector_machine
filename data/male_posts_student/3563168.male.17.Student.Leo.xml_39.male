I wish they would make television sitcoms the way they used to, like back in the late 80s to mid 90s. Those were the best. Not to mention actually funny.  The problem is that everyone is trying to make an instant hit, and they fail to realize in the midst of all that bullshit advertising with shitty ass music that sitcoms are supposed to be funny. There's always some big shot star that just fails because it's not big stars who make the show good. It's the writing.  All the good comedies I'm talking about stared no names who made it to the top for being funny, not movie actors or washed up actors that want another job. Trust me, it always fails.  Also, importing shows from other countries and trying to make them American fails too. That "Coupling" show was terrible. Except I'll give it some credit because the British version was terrible too. I hope that show burns in hell forever.  Anyway, my point is that stupid damn executives that have rods up their asses with rods up their asses don't know how to get things done anymore, and it's making TV more of a shit box now than it ever was.
