Oh, I finally swam across the local swimming pool underwater.  I was never good at holding my breath but I did it. ^^ I also found a good song on a CD I have, you know those songs that have a really bad beginning so you just skip over them but turn out to be really really good? Yeah, it was one o' those.  I beat Dagoth Ur!!!1!111!!!! ^_______^  The sucker was disappointingly easy, I coulda done it ages ago but I just had to spend all that time on side quests.  But thankfully I have two expansion packs loaded and this is an Elder Scrolls game so I know there is a LOT left to do.  Oh, and about my last post, it's spelt Khajiit. ... Khajiit women are hot.  Their voices are a bit deep but I, like most anime fanboys, have a fetish for girls who purr.
