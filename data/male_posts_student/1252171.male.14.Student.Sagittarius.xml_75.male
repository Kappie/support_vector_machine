But I was just playing SSB:M and noticed that if you have the beam sword or a sword weilding character, you'll notice that there's an aura-type thing following the slash. if you pause right when you hit your enemy, it will show the path of the sword and it will look like you slashed through their leg or head or something. Sometimes you  can imagine what they would be saying like, "Oohh, my ear!" Well, I put something new in the corner. They're called "things to think about."
