I want a blog to post all my personal stuff and have people I don't know comment on it, as they're impartial observers. However this then runs into the thing that most of the people who read my blog will be people I send the link to (i.e. my friends). This defeats the point of looking for impartial observers as the observers will be friends in a situation to remove the michael, the piss, and quite possibly my dignity. Such as it remains. Anyway. So the problem I have is that I cannot actually post anything I want to post in my blog. Unless all my friends look the other way. I know. I'll post whatever I want, and if you happen to know me, close the page now (but not before commenting, because that way I know not to post anything else).  Let's see how that works out.
