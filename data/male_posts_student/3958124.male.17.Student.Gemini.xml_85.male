But  last  night, he came home with: 1. A new 10-inch subwoofer. 2. A new progressive scan DVD player. 3. A new 5.1 receiver.  So I guess it was in December that we mounted 5 5-inch speakers in the wall and ran 30 feet of cable for each of them. This fact, coupled with the fact that we have  never  been good with speaker stuff, was the reason I stayed up until 1:00 hooking up our new surround sound equipment.  There were so many fucking problems:  1. Wire would not stay in the reciever, which lead us to believe the speaker wire was damaged somewhere in the wall. This would have sucked because, you know, the wire was behind the wall. The real problem? I didn't push them into the sockets properly. 2. The subwoofer produced only feedback. The problem? I didn't correctly connect the fucking coax jack. That one took us at least an hour alone. 3. After a whole night of work, one speaker wouldn't come on. The solution? Popping the speaker off the wall and connecting a wire that had been loose by less than one milimeter. This was at least half an hour of work. And I was hungry. 4. A door to a crawl space fell off. I don't have any clue how a door, which I've successfully opened and closed hundreds of times, could just come off of one of its hinges. I blame ghosts. 5.  I was tired.  One of the most dangerous things I have done is work on major projects like this one while tired.   Although the night was filled with feelings of anger, frustration, and sadness, it was finally filled with happiness. I sit here with a smile on my face, knowing that I have 5 glorious channels of mid- and high-range bliss, and a single, thumping channel of low-range fury, and you don't. Na na na na  na  na, I've got surround, and you don't.  Less blogging, sooner. (As I'll be watching shit in surround!) (Probably not shit though. Maybe Star Wars.) (I figured Joel would have picked up on that shit one and given me crap for it.) (Star Wars isn't shit, either.)
