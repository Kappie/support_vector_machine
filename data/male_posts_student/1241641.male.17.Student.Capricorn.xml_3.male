I did add a site tracker to The Schism and was surprised when I noticed that the most popular time to visit this site is between 12am-2am CST.  Roughly one third of my hits are in that time bracket.  So either my site helps people sleep, or reading about my antics and tomfoolery always makes it to the bottom of your to-do list.  Either way, thanks for visiting.  Clinton!  Clinton!  Clinton!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Well, former president Bill Clinton has released his memoirs.  Perhaps someday I'll get around to reading it, but with all the media hype surrounding it I think I already have.  Of course this media blitz is angering conservatives who seem to hate the budget balancing, welfare reforming forty-second president of the United States.  Sean Hannity, of Fox's Hannity and Colmes, recently expressed his desire for Clinton to just go away.  He talked about how he was sick and tired of the media frenzy surrounding the book.  Despite this, the Clinton memoir was the top story of his show and received much attention.  My advice to Mr. Hannity is if he wants the Clinton hype to be over with, don't join in.  Love him or hate him, do not fret, because he will eventually go away.  Much like Bush soon will.  But then he will release him memoirs and the story will top the Hannity and Colmes show.  Then maybe Alan Colmes will be upset.  Emphasis on maybe.  The Nick Colwell and John Kerry Similarity of the Day: We both played bass guitar in a high school rock band.  Today I'll leave you with the text from a sign seen over a U.S. freeway: "Ignoring the U.N. to invade Iraq for ignoring the U.N.  Pathetic."
