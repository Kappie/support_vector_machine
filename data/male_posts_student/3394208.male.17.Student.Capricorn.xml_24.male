To percieve into myself once again  is what happens when the heavens cry... cause what is there to do? locked in your room glaring at the computer monitor showing signs of glee when the words "1 new message" flashes on screen boredom... yes it goes hand in hand... and how irritating it is once it hits you... you tend to think of ways to get rid of it but it still remains, damn... why must it be like that? silence... it comes after boredom... or usually before that, but  it's more clear after... only it be broken by the continous pounding, or tapping of the rain on the roof or on the ground... why!?!?  Loneliness... Damn fucking rain won't stop... it's too cold too boring... too quiet... too lonely... shit someone come save me,  call or annoy me... release me from this fucking insanity DAMN FUCKING RAIN!!!!!! WHY MUST IT!!!!!!
