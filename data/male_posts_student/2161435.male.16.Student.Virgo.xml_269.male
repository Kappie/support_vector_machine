So now, we go to either a minibus or, easier, a campervan. Preferably a VW, Penmo found one the other night for Â£750, so it should be doable. Also, this guy said that it would be cheaper for Vicky and Bri-y to drive.   In other news, I am publicly apologising to Briony for saying she seek work as a dominatrix. it wasn't me, it was Ron, my alter ego, who sometimes signs my emails. (look at your keyboards, folks!)
