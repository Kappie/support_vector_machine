I am nice to everyone on the phones, because to be honest, as Ryan, I don't care if you pay your bill- I just leave messages and give you a chance to set your credit history right. Cause let me tell you- I have debts too, and when I'm working I do what they ask of me but I don't get nasty or over emotional because for what they pay me: it just isn't worth it.  So I've been there for a week and all is average.  I also had a fantastic weekend, props to Jarod!  So I will try to keep posting, but work eats my day away.
