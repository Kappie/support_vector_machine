My lower back hurts like a bitch, and it doesn't help that I spent 2 hours leaning over a railing trying to watch fireworks on the fourth. Shit I'm gettin' old.  Besides that, my knee is a piece of shit. Hurts like a mother when I walk, when I stand, when I sit, when I'm sleeping it hurts!  Shit I'm Old.  And fireworks...let me tell you about the dumbfucks in my neighboorhood. I get the fuckheads who think it's fun to start setting off fireworks on the 3rd of July.(that's not a typo) The jackasses kept me up 'til like 2 in the morning with that shit. Then on the fourth, I get home from my grandparents and there's a huge explosion. Of course I live in the "call the police whenever possible" neighboorhood, so there was a police helicopter above my house for 2 hours 2 minutes after the boom.  Ah, isn't life grand? I'm turning into an old man...I should just apply for social security now and get it over with.  Fuck, I'm old.
