Yeah you got it, have a tournament on Fifa 2004 (well what else did you think we were going to do...?) so after the best part of 4 hours, two pizzas and a lot of shouting, screaming and laughing later we had a winner... ME ...yay?  What did we do after that well, we recruited Sam and played football in real life and that's about it for today so far.  So see ya...  Dan :)  Current mood: Relaxed  Current music: Train - Mississippi
