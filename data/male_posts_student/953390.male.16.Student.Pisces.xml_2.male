I'm ready to   go somewhere!   Of course, I will be the week after next. Mum got reservations at  urlLink Largo Mar,  this little slightly upscale place in PC Beach we go to for all next week. She even said I could take a friend! I think I know who. My little brother can't, though. Too bad. :-( I checked my email this morn and... lo and behold, I got an email from Apple saying that my eMac shipped yesterday. Hooray! Welp, I think I'll go back to groovin' out to  urlLink 'Whenever You Feel Like It'  by Kylie Minogue. LOL
