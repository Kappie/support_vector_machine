Here I feel like I’m myself both in spirit and in being. Orange County is home for me, and it’s nice to know where stuff is… well the fact that there actually is stuff here is really cool. I’ll be spending a good chunk of the summer working at a coffee shop down in Laguna Beach… so the scent of ocean air and fresh coffee (two wonderful scents) will saturate my clothes with pleasantness.   I went to the  urlLink UCI Pub  last night with  urlLink Alex  and Brandon. Good times… afterwards, Brandon and I got some  urlLink Del Taco  and watched Conan.   John McCain was on Conan and it’s kind of a shame he shot down the idea of running with Kerry. While I don’t agree with everything the guy does, he’s not the dipshit that Kerry and Bush come across as. If Kerry wins, he’ll probably be a puppet just like Bush. Although, Kerry probably won’t be controlled by nuts like Cheney, Rumsfield, etc.  I like what  urlLink Gore  said the other day about those people in the Bush administration. Why didn’t he show these kind of balls when running for president?  I was talking to  urlLink Esther  the other day about how it’s the lesser of two evils in these elections.  Blondie was on Kilborn… the band can still play good stuff, but man does Debbie Harry look old. It was weird seeing her try to move her arms to show she’s still got energy.   ***
