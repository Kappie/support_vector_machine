It's not just a clever song from everyone's favorite thesaurus-toting  urlLink punk rawk  band.  Think before you decide that you can't live without that Escalade or Land Rover or whatever.  Keep it in mind that the guy running the show right now is a former oil exec and has at least three (that I can think of at this late hour) cabinet members with strong ties to big oil.  What does that mean to you?  It means no one is gonna do it for you.  It means no one is gonna make a law or make something illegal, it means that you (yes YOU) are going to have to be the agent of change.  Consume less, give back more.  Use earth-friendly  products .  In a very real sense, the fate of the earth is in your hands. Don't fuck it up.  Bunker Out.
