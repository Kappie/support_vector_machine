I never really liked the first movie, but it was amusing. Everyone told me the sequel sucked balls, and damn right they were.     Someone must've made a typo. I'm quite certain this movie's called "Starshit Poopers 2". What's up with the cover anyway? It looks like a terrible Photoshop job, and don't get me started on the people's [sarcasm]hyper-realistic[/sarcasm] facial expressions.  And I thought " Elf " was bad, HA! To make a comparison... this movie makes  urlLink Elf  seem like it had the quality of the goddamn StarWars trilogy (the first trilogy). I'm not kidding you. This is most certainly...  THE WORST MOVIE EVER FUCKING MADE IN THE FUCKING HISTORY OF FUCKING SCIFI FILMOGRAPHY!!!   There are many things I want to mock, err.. tell the world about this movie, let's see...  -  No plot/storyline at all.  This is the story: There's war between humans and bugs on some planet, there's like a group of eight or so soldiers left, and they decide to run and hide in a big bunker building. Then they stay there, not coming out for the whole film. Some aliens infect some of the humans and use them as hosts. Once infected, they're. I really mean, there is zero plotline, mediocre character development.  - The whole movie is filmed with a Sony handycam. You can tell from the video image quality, the feel of the movie's framerate, its responsiveness to blinking lights, and lastly, from the big "SONY Motion Pictures Systems" logo they put at the end of the credits. (Systems my ass! It was a frikin' handycam!!)  - Shitty acting. Cheesy dialogues.  - It is not just filmed with a handycam, it is also filmed without a stand, therefore the image is shakey during the whole film.  - The whole movie occurs in really dark places to hide the shitty sets.  - At one point, you see a bug's leg dead, stabbed into some thing, from like a previous battle. It looks like made of shitty spray-painted plastic. I've seen fake rubber croissants which looked way more realistic than that insect leg prop.  - The CG is shit. The lighting of the insects and their textures are especially craptastic.  - They couldn't even get the thunderstorm effects right... There is a storm while they're outside, and each time there's lightning, there is a very very faint flash on the people. This was clearly some cheap lights as proper lightning effects use these special lights that shine like hell, like they were a huge flash. The ones in this movie were most likely shitty lights, judging by the very faint light they gave away.  - A guy gets a huge spear, close to the diameter of your fist, right through his chest, and he screams like a total and absolute pussy. (Did I mention that if you get a huge spear through your lungs you can't actually scream? Apparently the suppernatural, puny human here could.) He also prolongued the scream quite a lot. Hell, if you got a huge spear through your chest, you'd die pretty quick.  - There was more pussy screaming after that. Even the exaggerated kind of an unnaturally-prolongated "...AAaaAaAAAaaaaAaAa...". -- Considering how shit that guy's wounds makeup was, it seemed like the guy had gone into an Italian restaurant, ordered pasta with tomato sauce, and rubbed it on random sides of his face.  - 21 minutes into the movie, I was still wondering what the plot was. Little did I know that by the time the movie ended, I found out there was no actual plot.  - They have a super-realistic radar screen, which apparently is able to detect bugs from anything else, judging by the fact that instead of the usual glowing green dots moving on the screen, there were little cockroach-like bug icons roaming around the radar screen. I guess it was too hard to try and not spoil the only realistic thing in the whole damn movie by changing the dots to bulky bug icons (that can even change direction, as if the radar could tell if one of the bugs turned 90ยบ to its side or not). They should've called it the bugdar.  - The explosions were CG 'cause they couldn't afford a few explosives. The explosions were total and utter crap. They looked super fake. I've seen better rendered explosions in Discovery Channel programmes.  - The weapons have zero backwards thrust when they shoot, or the actors forgot to act like they did. I mean come on, any respectable weapon has at least a little backwards push when it fires something. - And when they fire, guess what the firing looks like... yes, you guessed it, a little flashing light. (A little LED light, I think.) The guns don't do anything when they are fired. They just flash that stupid light. - And also have unlimitted ammo for some reason. (There is not a scene in the whole movie where someone "recharges" his/her weapon somehow.) - And they are huge and bulky and shoot tiny bullets regardless of wether they're a handgun, or nearly the length of a bazooka. They all shoot sissy bullets. There's like some humungus shotgun that is close to the size of a bazooka and shoots bullets comparable to a simple handgun, WITH a small flashing LED bulb.  - The score doesn't match the movie, and judging by how it sounds, it's a very tiny orchestra... probably less than 12 members. - The sound-editing person was a moron. The voices were wayyyyyy louder than the soundtrack, to the point you don't feel the soundtrack at all.  - There is a shot in the kitchen where the camera moves around a table. The camera man is so bad that you can notice the man walking from the camera's shaking.  - At one point in the movie, two cables got run over, and the whole building gets a powercut and shuts down. May I remind you this is in the future, like 2035, and this building is very strong and hi-tech, and supposed to be a bunker (so there should be emergency systems), yet two mere cables being run over is enough to shut the whole building down? What is this, don't humans know about electricity management in the future?  - They had one night-vision binoculars thingy. The end of it had only one central lens, to appear to be modern. But the actual lens isn't a lens, it is a piece of green plastic, with a light behind it. It's funny when the actors pick it up and do like they're seeing something.  - I was 47 minutes into the movie and like I said before, still wondering what the fuck the plot is. I'm still wondering it now. Oh wait, there isn't one.  - It has such a SHIT ending.  - The blood effects were absolutely crap.  - In one scene, a woman gets hit on her head really badly by a huge object, and a powerful squirt of blood goes on the glass window, then she falls to the ground unconscious, but her head shows no signs of being hit. Not even a cut.  - The camera panning is so cheap. It's clearly a guy holding the handycam and turning it around.  - This movie is classified as Scifi Horror, but it's so terribly shit, that the genre is more like Comedy. It's like watching the Dalek robot movies. Those movies were supposed to be scary back then, but now you watch it and it's like it were "the invasion of the large rolling trash-cans with a long immobile probes that shoot smoke, who interact with human-sounding monotonous voices, even with each other". (Why would robots from outer space talk to each other with voice? They can build an enormous UFO, but not a wireless network?) -- Anyway, this blog post is about starshit troopers 2, not the dalek robots, so back to what I was saying...  - At one point, there's a Blade cliche when one of the infected humans attacks this other guy. The guy attacking has full red eyes, Blade-style. The scene's pretty badly acted though.  - oh no, a shitty CG scorpion-cockroach is attacking a black man in his white boxers underwear! ...and one of the guys that is on the floor is making what appears to be orgasm sounds which were supposed to be moans of fear or pain as a number of spiders crawled over him, biting and stuff.  - Near the end there's a pretty shitty spaceshit, err spaceship, probably done as fast as possible in 3dsmax.  - Oh noe, it's action man! -- after the spaceship, a guy jumps out, with two large machine guns, and shoots some bugs or something. Gotta love his shitty neutral facial expression. (Even Terminator had more expression.)  - Near the end, there's one of the guys who is now wearing a robot arm, or more like a large glove. It's very clearly a shitty plastic glove. Did they find it at Toys'R'Us? ...and nice hologram sticker that you stuck on a side of it. Adds a nice touch of mediocrity to the overflowing sack of shit that is this movie.  - Everything in this movie is predictable. Let's put an example... In one scene, a hot naked woman tempts a soldier to come to a shadowy corner. Yes, you guessed it, she's evil due to being infected by the bugs. (This is a very cheesy scene by the way.) Then, guess what she has smeared on her chest, yep, you guessed it, blood. Now guess what's gonna happen... damn, you got it again, the other infected soldiers are surrounding their victim, and while the victim argues in fear, guess what, yep, you're right, someone comes from behind and grabs him.   - Now that I mention the blood effects in the movie... it was really shitty fake blood. It looked like red paint. Actual real blood has a much darker colour, and stains a hell of a lot more than their stupid red dyes.  - In the scene with the naked woman I mentioned a minute ago, the evil man that walks behind the victim decides to cut the guy's throat with a knife. The camera shows us how they cut him, and there is a very tiny amount of blood that comes out of the wound, and then no more blood comes out, while in real life, there would be a HUGE bloodflow and some really disturbing screaming.  - There was a fight scene where some woman starts beating up some infected soldiers, and it's so badly crafted. A few seconds afterwards, it becomes what looks like a cheesy rape scene, then one evil guy stabs a knife on her throat. Of course, the blood looked as realistic as ketchup on some McDonalds fries.  - All bugs can produce screeching sounds, no matter what size. Of course, it would be too hard for the writer of the screenplay (if there's even an actual writer), to realise that no organism can make sounds without some vocal cords.  - In one scene, one of the infected people cuts off someone's head, and it looks like a shitty rubber head. I've seen Halloween masks which looked more realistic.  - In another scene, some bug comes out of one of the dead infected people, out of her head. Her head was full of what I could best describe as strawberry jell-o and some guts of some animal, probably a sheep's intestine, bought at the local meat shop. There is no sight of an actual brain anywhere. Not a trace of it.  - In another scene, an infected woman is set on fire in some closed chamber. Within a second, you see a CG of her, absolutely burnt, with a cartoon-like carbon effect, and yet, still screaming in pain. (Oh, and her eyes magically did not get burned at all, while the rest of her body is all black and burnt. I guess they needed some eyes for us to realise that was her and not some plank of burning wood.) Again, the screaming is very faint. I'm quite certain that if you're being burnt alive you should scream pretty loud.  - What some people said about it: "  When I saw the first 5 minutes I thought that it was fake Because the camera sucked  "  "  THE WHOLE FUCKING FILM SUCKED after 45m i turned it off and complained to blockbuster for even putting it on the shelve and u wanna know what was even more worse? i picked up once apon a time in mexico then saw ST2 on the shelf so i put back once apon a time and picked up ST2 then i got it home and i was like is this a preview or something then it was the whole film i thought actually that some 1 made there own version and stuck the dvd in the case  "  "  I watched it and thought I could have had more of an enjoying time sticking my penis in a light socket.  "  "  If anyone ever asks me what is the worst movie you have ever seen.. I don't think I will even need to think about it..  "  "  I want a screenshot of the scene with the black man on his tight, white boxer shorts, slapping the bugs. That is priceless.  "  - This is pretty funny... at the end of the credits, they put " The characters and incidents portrayed and the names herein are fictitious, blah blah blah... " OH REALLY!??!! I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL BASED ON A REAL STORY!!!   - I'd like to quote a  urlLink post  on IMDb.com:  Before the movie started, director Phil Tippett walked out to address the audience (which filled less than 1/4 of the seats). He basically came out to apologize for what we were about to witness. He explained that the studio wanted to keep the Starship Troopers franchise alive, so the picture we were about to view was created. I believe he quoted the budget for the original film to be $140 million. The budget for ST2: $6 million. Do the math.   I do think, however, that with $6 million I could've done a much better movie. And isn't it funny how the actual director apologizes for his creation? I've never heard of that happening before.  I'm thinking I may or may not get some screen captures of the movie to illustrate my review, sometime in the next week or something. I'll let you know if I ever upload some pics.
