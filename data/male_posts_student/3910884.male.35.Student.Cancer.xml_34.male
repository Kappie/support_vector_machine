Michelle was right, I should have brought a ski jacket with me (maybe I'll bring my sweatshirt with me where ever I go...). :)  You don't even see that many in the Bay Area but then again it's usually freezing/foggy in SF 24-7, 365 anyways.     Well, had camerones today. Not as in shrimp as you Spanish speakers might think but BUGS! I was told it was a delicacy in Pampamga. Not so bad, yup crunchy, like shrimp if you didn't peel them. Kinda looks like grasshoppers or something (I was told it was like miniature locusts or something). Well, if Moses could eat them, I reckon they couldn't all that bad (it was actually quite yummy and I know bugs are nutritious, for example, cockaroaches are 90% protein!).    Yup it's raining today. If the aircon of everyone in the Philippines was turned outwards we'd be in 4 feet of snow by now across all the islands. No joke lang!    Oh yeah, it's hay(na)ku (not how I spelled it the other day.
