And that is exactly how I feel with Laura. Knowing that she knows I really do care, and knowing that I actualy mean something to her. Laura you are the best! Our time to be together will come some time, i hope, but i will not rush that time to come any sooner. I want it to work out, and show you how great things can be.  Love ya Laura!
