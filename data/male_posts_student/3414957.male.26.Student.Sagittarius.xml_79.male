I just make a note in my mid that they are wrong, especially when it comes to computers and stuff, and then I just say oh wow thanks for the information.   Now its time to write another 6 page essay. I was stmped about what to write but I had an inspiration right now so I will whip this assignment out in no time! Hopefully.
