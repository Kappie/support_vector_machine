Well, I have lots of these "little things", but inorder to get the full meaning of these instead of calling them "things" lets call them annoyances. Yes, "little annoyances", much better! Now that we have them properly defined I will share some with you.   How about when your talking with someone and all the do is stare at your hair and never look you right in the face. Sometimes I want to reach-out and grab their head  and angle it down to eye level.  Or when someone always breaths through their mouth. You know that heavy oral cavity breathing that sounds like they are on a respirator or something. Sometimes I just want to reach out and put both my hands over their mouth in order to force them to breath out their nose just once! Although I do not suggest you do this to someone who has a cold, this could result in them passing out or passing on, depending on how weak they are and how long you suppress their air flow;(  OH! Here's a good one! ONE-UP-Manship (This is not about the green mushrooms that give you an extra life).  urlLink Mr. Harmless  knows it better as "that's nothin". There the people who always have a bigger and better story. If you ever want to tell if someone is a "that's nothin" kind of person use this fool proof test I learned from  urlLink Mr. Harmless . You start by telling a story about how one day you died and you got rushed to the hospital via life-line and after rigor mortis had just set in you got revived by  urlLink Chuck Norris . If they are the type you think they are you can almost say along with them "that's noth'n". (jinx :)  Another one... how about those people, usually girls, who pretend to be really ditzy. They ask questions like "did mount Rushmore form naturally"or ______________ (fill in the blank to make yourself laugh). Sometimes I think they want attention, but  who knows maybe they really are that stupid?  One more.....pickers and eaters....enough said.   -unifictious Facts from the Viking-
