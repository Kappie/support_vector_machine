I was having one of those sick dreams... tossing and turning and junk last night... you know how the guy who created the Terminator thought up the whole idea for his movie from a  flu dream, of the robot emerging from the flames? I had a dream that kinda reminded me of a long movie, but it made no sense at all.  It started out, me and some people(they were all faceless... kinda just... people) were getting a tour of some kind of horse race thing... we walked outside to look at the tracks, and the tour guide left us alone for a while to look around, then all of the sudden a bull smashed through(albeit slowly) the wall separating us from the horse tracks. The bull wasn't doing anything, but the people were freaking out, so I(but remember, i still think this is a movie) go back to the tour guide, and she doesn't seem too concerned.  At this point in my mind i say "Man, this movie goes on FOREVER!!"   Then we go back to look at the bull, and instead of a bull, we find a Hunter, from the game Halo. I shoot him, then the group and I(although the group are now marines) run down the track, dodging exploding walls and battling the flood(mutated monsters for you non-Halo fans).  then, all the sudden, the scene changes to Danny Tamborelli(younger Pete from Pete  Pete) driving up to this checkpoint- the guard steps out and goes "Boogah boogah boogah!" and then all the sudden Danny is running down the road, being chased by the guard, but also chasing him are a pair of pants, spinning on a pole.  He loses the guard and comes up on another, larger post station. There was another guard there and he says "what are you doing with those spinning pants!" and Danny says "Smith!"(i think he was referring to the guard chasing him). The guard says "Smith? What? He's right here, I found him behind his guard post eating dandelions!" and pulls out a fat man in a highway patrol suit with yellow petals sticking out of his mouth.  Danny then says "But... if it wasn't you, then..."  Then both the guards say "Boogah boogah boogah!!!" and he screams, and the scene changes again.  First it's dark, then, as if night goggles are turned on, you see the inside of a small room, with a couch, and a rug under it. I for some reason know that the rug is really dirty. Then all the sudden the vacuum cleaner starts working on it's own, cleaning the rug... but it doesn't do anything, the dust just comes back. For some reason, in the movie, this is funny, because it had a delightful tone to it for some reason.  Then, the scene changes again, and now a young Jack Black is eating cereal. He's just eating and eating. Then, he drops his spoon and a whole mess of milk splashes him in the face. He starts laughing and splashing some more. Then it showed the scene where danny was running from the spinnning pants on a pole again. Then I woke up.  I'm surprised at 2 things.  1. It was so long 2. I remembered it. 3.   Wait... that's 3 things.  1. It was so long 2. I remembered it. 3. My mind came up with this stuff.  Hmm... I'm about to fall over now because of my fluishness, so i'm gonna take a nap. See ya.
