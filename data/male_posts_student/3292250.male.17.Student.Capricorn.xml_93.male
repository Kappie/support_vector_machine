I though I'd use it as a title because today in Missouri and Kansas is the 2004 Primary (GOP, I think, but then again Democrats just don't run in Johnson County, KS). All of you in Kansas and Missouri go out and vote (if you're 18). If  I  was voting, I wouldn't know the candidates. If you're in Missouri, vote  NO  on Amendment 2. If you're in KCM, vote for the arena. Don't let STL have all the tourism.
