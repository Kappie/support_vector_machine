The singer (Jerry) is Tycho from  urlLink Penny Arcade.  The only place that I've found with their music is  urlLink MP3.com. Very nice music. Check out some their lyrics:      english    she is not mobile, she just watches me  i am noticable when light catches me  i am illegible any way you look at me  you know my english has deficiencies   and is it any wonder that I  when faced with these odds  would even it with lies  and is it any wonder that i  surrounded by storm  surmounted by swarm  would attempt to obtain the prize   there's a terror to the scenery  a certain fervor to the front of me  and i count them as my enemies  those who mean to be close to me
