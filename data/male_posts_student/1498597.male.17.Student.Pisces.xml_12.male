I was watching  Even Stevens ... yes I know that show is on Disney, but anyway, and it started to get me thinking... The show was about Louis' (main character) transition from being a wise guy/class clown, to a more laid back serious type of person. Now, how can I apply to this to our or just   my  life? Possibly by toning it down a little in the joke department or by trying to take on a more serious outlook or position on life. Who knows? But it just now occurred to me that something MUST change. Whether it is the jokes, or responsibility issues,  I WANT TO CHANGE .  Many people could very well argue that the above is a very weak argument or decision. However, I do not think so. (Hence, I do not think... haha j/k.) At any rate, if you are shocked over the next few days that I tone it down, just remember my main goal.  There is a time to be serious, and there is a time to be funny. Yet, these times can NOT be interchangeable, can they? If beauty is in the eye of the beholder, opinions are in the head of the thinker......  Thank you  JR for the GREAT post about what is to come. Of course we will have a logo, it will just be a little while before I can tinker with the HTML to see  where  the logo will actually go! Any ideas anyone?  Also, we are trying to expand our readership! So, c'mon, start gathering your friends here, we ( JR and I ) would REALLY enjoy it. Thanks for your time and help!  This is  Nick  signing off for now. Stay tuned for more following a few words from our sponsors.
