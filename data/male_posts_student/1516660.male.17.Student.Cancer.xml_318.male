I really need the moolah to save up, so I keep pressing him to return ( some  people still owe me $3 for MONTHS!). He said he can't spare me moolah. That time, I was feeling particularly bored and bo liao, I put myself up for a dare. I said he won't return me the $1.50 if I tell WQ I liked him. Well, I know I wouldn't want to, because I don't like him and he might take the joke seriously and cut off our friendship. Then, today early morning after GB, CQ dared me la. I refused profusely, but he said WQ could reveal who he likes. Now, since he put it that way, I am up for the challenge. $1.50 is so worth it for knowing who is WQ's crush. Therefore, I made up this cock-and-bull story about me having feelings for him since last year...blah blah blah. HaHa. He is so slow! He asked "who is 'you'?"! Ayioh! "You" means him lor! Then, he refused to believe it, saying it is lame, unbelievable and is a joke. Hmm. Me and CQ decided to own up and say it is indeed a joke. Well, I didn't get the info I wanted. Wasted my efforts! Heh Heh Heh!   Hmmm. After that, me and Wendy SMSed each other for an hour (it was 1am). HaHa. We chatted about her problem at work. Heh. I gave some creative suggestions. O.O! I wonder how it went. Must sms her later. Yes! After that, I fell asleep lor.  Hmm. I woke up at 8 and took a 45-minute bath. Uhm hmm. After that, I went to watch the TV while reading newspapers. Mother came back at 9.30, bringing back breakfast (duck porridge). Hmm, at 10, I went online and chatted with a few cats. Hmm. At 11, I went away to watch HZGG and eat lunch. HZGG is terribly touching... I teared at a few scenes. Yes!   After HZGG, I went online for awhile, then was off to watch a Channel 8 documentary (Shu Li Shu Qu) and my recorded Pokemon show yesterday. Even Larvitar meowed!! So cute! After that, I went back to chat with cats like CQ, XC and Snapeluva. Hmm. We chatted till 4.30, when Unbeatables is showing. At 5, my brother's friend came here.   I went down to buy dinner. Oh my god. I am so lucky! I came home early. After some more minutes, it started pouring heavily. Phew! I ate my dinner while watching Unbeatables. At 6.30, I went to bath and here I am online. Hmm. I fell asleep just now. So tired now. *Yawns*  Oh well. Tomorrow is the start of the school. Today ends my 4-months holidays. Oh well. TaTa to freedom!  Ahh well. I gotta go now. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
