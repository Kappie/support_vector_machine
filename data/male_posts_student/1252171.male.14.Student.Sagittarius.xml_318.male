Anyways, we got into the apartment okay, I miss you all very much, and yes, I will email you both my new number. *Pets Anthrax, then pets Fabio(with care)* Did I tell you that I actually have some color. And no, it is not off-white. It's like a tan to semi-sunburn. I miss you guys very much.  Can I write a story about Hobbes and Katt finding out they are brother and sister, SI? I have it all typed out on my cousin's computer and I can get it to the site by...*checks very busy schedule, which includes:being lazy, sleeping, going for walks, lounging by the heated pool, tanning, saving the world from flesh eating demon babies from Mars, and, ooo a blank spot* by Saturday, k?   I LUV BOTH YOU GUYS IN A STRAIT NON-SEXUAL, JUST FRIENDS WAY!!!!   -Dilussional Child-
