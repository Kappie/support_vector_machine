All I could do now is to give her my regards and wish her the best.. We have to learn to let go sometimes, though it may inflict pain on ourselves.. Thats the way of life.. My previous entries were deleted.. for my new lease of life perhaps.. I couldn't even fathom my own thoughts sometimes, which may seem a little too distorted.. The winds of change do alter us.. and I have changed too.. Nobody is perfect, though perfection is wonderful.. So, we have to live with what we got, and cherish them well.. I used to take things lightly and I was able to forgive and forget easily.. But perhaps the revolving of the universe have evolved me.. Revenge is sweet, and I would like to taste it.. He incurred my wrath and now he shall face the dreadful consequences.. However, I do forgive and forget, depends on who that person is.. and the degree of his wrongdoing.. Well, 1st post since I deleted my entries.. Fall into deep slumber, my confiding soul..
