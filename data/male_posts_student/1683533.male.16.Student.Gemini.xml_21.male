I would post the lyrics to these songs, but I fear somebody will steal them....and i shouldn't even put the names of the songs down cause people might steal those.   "Skank Till Ya Drop"  will probably be the funnest to work with but also the hardest because I never wrote a song with upbeat ska chords.  I will figure it out eventually.  We should also think of a name too...that would be good.  Right now I am listening to The Suicide Machines,  I had one of their previous albums (their self-titled one) and I just got Destruction by Definition.  And the two cds sound as though there are two different bands playing in them.  The self-titled has slower songs, not many ska chords, and 2 very hard songs...almost hard rock.  Destruction of Definition has a ton of ska chords and alot of fast songs.  Very hardcore.  But I still like both cds so it's ok.   I also got a Nerf Herder cd....Ben suggested it to me before.  and I am pleased with it....its a good cd also.  My e-mail is up at top if you like my blog.....or even if you hate it.  I like some feed back.  Also I could use some ideas for a band name...so just give me a buzz if you have any ideas.
