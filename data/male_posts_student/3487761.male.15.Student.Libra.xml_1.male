It is the reopen of the school, the most detestable place for me since I was in my 'holiday' mood.    The school never stop giving me surprise... Oral!!! It is on the coming Friday! I really hate to say that Im very afraid to face up with this oral. Maybe it is my youth causes. Sigh......Why did I only learnt to speak properly in primary one... I have at least 4 years lesser of years of speech. Even now the past difficulty that I had still exsist.    Looking on the bright side, I have finally finish recording down all the birth dates of 2e4 .....ermmmm.....YuuuuHuuuuu!!!!
