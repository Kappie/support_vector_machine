As for Network Admin, I admit, I really suck at how things are done in Windows. I am a UNIX man through and through, and the terms are so wacky and weird, it kinda confusing, however, I now, after reading and translating into UNIX language ;-) I now understand what some of the stuff means.         btw, ever notice that Active Directory is more complicated than it needs to be? is it really necessary to have all those buzzwords? why not make it nice 'n easy(tm) like NDS or OpenLDAP?         On Friday last week, on the way to the gym I was hit by a car, head on, massive cut in my leg, very sore all over. It seems bad luck for me has an irotic twist; I had just finished fixing the breaks on my bike, I was on the way to the gym, the driver of the car is doctor and the accident occured 50 metres outside a hospital, oh, and interesting enough, the breaks failed on my bike which didn't exactly help me in the accident.       Good things:        Bought a nice  urlLink Apple iBook Laptop  second hand/refubished along with extra memory to bring it up to 320MB RAM. It should run MacOS X quite nicely, however, if not, I can always wait till NetBSD 2.0 is released, which IIRC has a really awsome new threading model based on schedule activations (which is what KSE from FreeBSD is based on). About the only downside, however, is that NetBSD doesn't support the internal modem, which doesn't really matter considering I'll throw it onto my little network.
