"Stuart" "yes Mr president" the room was an amalgamation of the west wing and the black and white footage of the Cuban missile crisis we have all seen a million times.(I was Sam from the west wing BTW)  "I have a very important assignment for you" "certainly sir" "I have to go and paint J.Edgar hovers left cheek orange, it's a whole big thing" "OOOO-kay" "I was supposed to be 'entertaining' about a dozen secretaries(mmmmmm secretaries) in an hour, I need you to fill in for me" suddenly im in a massive typing pool wearing just a cravat and smoking a bubble pipe  Well that's all folks, more  from my unbalanced subconscious later  :: wonders if i could get a secretary ::
