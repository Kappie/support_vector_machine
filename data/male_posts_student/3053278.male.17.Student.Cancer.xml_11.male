I don't feel like anything when I fence them but it still makes me happy when I know that if I'm not getting anything out of it maybe they are. I still wish that Mer and Jason would come on Tuesdays. Well actually I really just wish it was mer. No that's not what I meant(If you know about the team you know that  Mer and Jason are an item).I actually just have a certain dislike for Jason,the only real like I have for him comes out of respect for his leadership.  After easily going through the sabre fencers I fenced some epee. Beat up on James and matt and then fenced one last person. Martha. Enough said. No not really she claims i only got one touch and told her two but I have a pretty good memory and the score was for sure 5-3. I HATE Her. Nay just playin', I love Martha. Happy to have her as a friend and fellow captain. One thing that does worry me though is whether or not I'm going get the girls to stand behind the guys. I remember last year the boys were all ways behind the girls even during the state tourn. The girls didn't seem to show the same support for the guys. Hopefully we can change this next year.
