It's worse than any other thing I've suffered frm so far. If I had the opportunity to tap out of this, I would, a million times too. Damn, this is horrible. When I move my body or even juz sneeze, the pain is unbearable! Argh...  This is all cus of the goddamn NAFFA test man. *Sighz*, juz rite after my shuttle run, i fell. Tt was when the pain started to set in. But, I still continued to do sit ups and the standing broad jump as I felt I've already come so far. Doing the standing broad jump was one of the biggest I've ever made in my life. Once I landed, I felt as though my abodmen was ripped apart. It was total hell and I couldn't control the pain any longer.  Although this was a torture, I was finally able to tell who my true frens are and who I'm able to trust. Most of my frens frm 4E3 and 4E4 were concerned about my conditions, and I was honestly touched by this, thanks alot guys! There were realli some pals of mine who were there when I needed them. There was Debbie, who made sure tt I was fully ok before she left frm my side. Now, where can u find such a sweet ger? Then there's Mal, who forced me to take a cab home as I was in pain. There were oso guys like Ze Hao, Gervais, Wei Qiang and Sian Yang who wanted to send me home, but I juz couldn't accept tt wonderful offer. There was oso a teacher who wanted to gif me a lift home, but again, I declined it.  When I got home, the pain didn't subside. It became frm bad to worse and was a torture. I didn't tell my parents and haf not seen a doctor yet. There were some ppl who said they heard a "cracking" sound, which implied a broken bone. I won't noe and I will not wanna noe. Mal, Debbie and Gervais insisted tt I see a doctor, but I refused. Sorry guys, I haf my reasons ya? Eventually, I lied to my parents about it. I told them it was juz aching and tt was why I didn't feel like eating. *Sighz* I juz hope tt the pain will go away by tmr, so tt I can return to school. Once again, thanks to every1 tt were concerned bout' me and asked me how I felt. I realli appreciate it, Thanks! =]
