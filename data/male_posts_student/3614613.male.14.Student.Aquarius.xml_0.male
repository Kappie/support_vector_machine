Maybe it's only my computer, or maybe ( ugh, I wish ) lots of people are all coming to my site at the same time because it's so popular and there's why even blogspot's server can't support it.  Ah music. I like music. Anyway, I wanted to put up music iwebmusic but I tried going to my own site and this security warning appeared. Remember kids, when ever you see that, always click no. Just in case anyone didn't know and tried to press yes, I removed iwebmusic altogether. Yeah, I do care about my reader's computer health you know?  Almost every paragraph ends in a -_- if you're someone particularly sensitive to bullshit. Anyway, you know the line about "ah-choo, I'm allergic to bullshit"? Well I'm quite tired of hearing that already. It's getting too repetitive, if you get to give me that -_- face in real life where I can see it, think of something else witty to say.  So... It seems that in today's newspaper there's an article on somebody getting an Asia's best blogger award. I forgot what the site is, and I don't think you people care much about that either, so I suppose that doesen't matter. Anyway in it, it's reportedly notorious for dissing about a lot of things.
