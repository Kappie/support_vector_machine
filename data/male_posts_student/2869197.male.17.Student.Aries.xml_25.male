I went in there expecting a mindless action movie filled with one-liners and a decent actor, Viggo Mortenson, one of the select handful of actors/actresses I can remember (LOTR hath me). I got this and a little more. If purely by luck and randomosity, they struck a point of importance in my life. This happened in the scene were the wife of some rich Major or such invited Viggo into her house. She obviously had Viggo's pride on her mind more than the horse race. Just when it was about to get hot and heavy, Viggo says, "Good night, Milady" and walks off. The point is reached by the fact that she is refered to as "the Christian lady" throughout the movie. Is that what Christianity is about? Be all "holier-than-thou" until you get out into the desert with a stud and no one is watching, like your husband? Extrapolate this. Do Christians in general only act nice and godly when other humans are around? Obviously not all of us. Some of us have reached that connection with God where we act in secret just as we act in public. I haven't and, thus, am flawed, a disgrace to God and the Church (with capital letters, signifing the holy collective of true Christians). My actions are often skewed without some noisy observer keeping me accountable. I still have much to learn. As I said, a point of importance.
