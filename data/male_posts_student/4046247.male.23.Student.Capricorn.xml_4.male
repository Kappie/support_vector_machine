You hear a lot about how dangerous Mexico City is, but that shouldn't deter anybody from going and getting a great dose of culture. While there, I walked around the central square (the Zocalo) and the Catedral Metropolitana, and saw Maximilian's palace in the Bosque de Chapultepec, as well as the fantastic Anthropology Museum.
