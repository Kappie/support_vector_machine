Today, the opening day, the whole thing went into a frenzy.  The whole Cage Match thing is controversial. Some members like it, others think it's stupid and pointless.  I'm still begging my parents to get batteries so I can finish the Golden Sun game. They seem to never have any time for that.  Today started off like every other day. I tried to go to chess club, but nobody showed up. I guess the schedule change wasn't in effect yet. I got ticked.  In other news, I have work tomorrow. Not 4 to 7 as usual on Fridays, but 3-7 shift. Woohoo, finally. One more hour.  One full hour: it's a start, but I'm getting more hours.
