I wanted to have a place to write the shit that comes from my head, but I also didnt want to be an emo fag. I think that 'blogspot' is something a professional would use. Not a professional web designer, maybe a professional infant. I could have used Verdana but I went with Times new Roman, it really brings out the deep deep emotion that I feel more. And, oh no, I cant make indents for my paragraphs, how messy!       I can press the enter key which is nice. I am curious how people with no arms use a computer. Perhaps they have become skilled enough with their feet that they can use their feet to manipulate the keyboard. If that were the case, I would not invite that person to my house, I dont want their dirty stanky feet on my damn keyboard. Should there be apostrophes? Its so dark!      emo post:   I am so emotional. I enjoy writing sad poetry and cutting myself. Oh wait, no I dont, I dont enoy anything because I am an emo fag. I listen to sad music and hang out with sad people. I'm so sad that I have been born into this TERRIBLE EXISTENCE which requires me to go to school! and be around people! they just dont understand! My life in the suburbs pulling down a decent wage and driving a decent car is so terrible. oh boo hoo everybody be sad for me.           I hate people. I really hate everybody. The Internet is like a magnet for subhuman creatures. If only there were a device which allowed me to pimp slap people via the Web, I would give my middle nut for that privelege.      Peace, out.
