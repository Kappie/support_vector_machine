(actually, please don't. i'm poor. sue my brother.)  anyway yea, it's been another damn long time since i've updated this poor little excuse for a blog. thi and owen say they like it (thanks guys, that means a lot), and they want me to go back with it...silly thi, assuming that i would write again just for her sake. actually, she was right. i wonder if i'll be able to update daily again. but considering how much time i've been playing nba street vol. 2 (BEST GAME EVARR), i might be able to manage. (i OWN erik and alex in street. thank you. tho alex can consistently wipe the screen to a sparkling finish with my remains in timesplitters 2.) i've also seen a lot of people using xanga...i refuse to give in! no more bandwagoning for me. not like i ever bandwagon. yeup.  let's see what i have to update. um, i've recently downloaded a lot of new songs...work it remix (missy f/50 cent), my immortal (evanescence), are you happy now? (mechy? michy? bah), if you're not the one (daniel bedingfield...what a lame name, how can you make a football team called the bedingfielders?), not in my house (nelly...from the best game evarr), etc. (btw, that stupid dj in the background of rap songs goin STREET SWEEPERS and DRAMA HOUSE...what a fruit. let us illegally download in peace!)  i have a b in chem, but our final is worth 15% of our grade. cha-ching. now if i can just study a year's worth of material (no, make that roughly 2 months considering how much we actually learn in that class) in 7 days. btw, wtf kinda teacher takes off points for not writing your last name (sumit g? o hmm, i wonder who that is...) or the date? yea, cuz you know how teachers rely on their kids to tell them what day of the week it is. then she takes off a point for not showing how you came up with the partial pressure of a gas after subtracting vapor pressure...die sykes die die die die  gj to leo and kevin ho and anthony and all those ppl working on the mural across the cafeteria. it's...yellow and...different, but very well done.  hmm, i suck. my basketball skills are limited at best and i was terrible vs. alex and kevin in 21 (much like my drawing, which i haven't practiced in forever), i didn't win any officer positions...oh well. what do i look forward to everyday? good question...trying to prove i'm not completely hopeless. but to whom? my 5th grade teacher who made me co-editor of a class newspaper...mrs. t, who inexplicably thinks i'm a good writer...my cousin angela who laughably thinks i'm going to berkeley. i really like my cousins but it's hard to talk to her irl, even tho we sometimes chat a lot on aim...in person she's always with her mom, and i never decide to bother her. it's easier to hang with jill (her sister), who goes to ucsd...she says beware of the quiet people, they are the ones who get their freak on the most when drunk and stuff. (why are you all looking at me like that?) she also says we're lucky to be in high school...college is a killer. and that the tolerance of small asian girls for tequila in "tj" is bottomless.  a couple weeks ago at la for my grandma's 90th birthday bash...ping pong is fuuun. now if only i were good...story of my life.  happy belated birthdays to...melissa tung (don't get me drunk plz! thankies) and elsie. (who is this elyse i hear people talking about?)
