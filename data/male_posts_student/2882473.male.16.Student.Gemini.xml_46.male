Better not give too many details away, but I had a fairly easy role-play, and the general conversation was ok. I kind of buggered up my presentation half way through, but I managed to recover. I understood most of the questions, although I probably started repeating myself towards the end. Glad that it's over. Sorry Megatrobe, but: Hahahahaha, you have to do yours tomorrow. Wow, I never have to utter a word of German again, only read it. Meh, I'll manage.  Oh, I was just shown this, I though was rather funny:  urlLink Why you should never put your picture on the Internet ...   Not much else to say.   Reading:  Interesting Times  Listening to:  Some Oliver Twist music  Watching:  Nothing really  Confused about:  Nothing really  Annoyed with:  Nothing really  Mood:  Ok, I suppose
