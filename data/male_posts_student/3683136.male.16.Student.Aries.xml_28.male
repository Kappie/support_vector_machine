My emotions have been all over the place, but for the past couple days I've settled at content (with some time/work related stress).  Events of the past 3 weeks:  My first (personal) encounter with Homophobia: Seungwon Chung is a fucking asshat.  Around the beginning of week 2, I was in the library, and this kid behind me (Seungwon) was talking about some shit, and said some really homophobic shit.  It really upset me, I confronted him about it, he asked if I was gay, I said yes, and then he told me that he was uncomfortable around gay people.  That bothered me... I was really upset for a couple days.  But things are ok, I suppose... this is something I have to learn to deal with.  there's so little significance to everything.  MY HAIR IS FUSCHIA.  IT'S FUCKING PINK. AND I GOT TWO SHIRTS AT GAP THAT ROCK.  YAY.  -Mike  Oh baby baby, how was I supposed to know, that something wasn't right here.
