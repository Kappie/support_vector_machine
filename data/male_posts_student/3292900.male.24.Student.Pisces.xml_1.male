The gargoyle on the roof smiled at Lulo as he always did, but this time a tear fell from the gargoyle’s stone eye. You should know that something bad had happened if it was enough to make the gargoyle shed a tear, because the gargoyle was made of stone and one would think that a thing made of stone would never shed a tear. However, this Gargoyle was so fond of Lulo, and so happy that he had come to live there, that he was sad because he knew the future and he knew what sadness and sorrow was in store for Lulo in the near future. Lulo saw his Cuco lying on the couch when he entered. He looked for his friend who’d been to the military but he was gone. His Cuco looked so peaceful. He looked so content lying there, asleep. Lulo always thought that his Cuco was the most beautiful man alive. He loved his Cuco very much. He thought that his Cuco also loved him very much. He always said he “thought,” because, Lulo said, he could never know for sure. Lulo always said that there was no way of knowing anyone else’s feelings but one’s own. Lulo knew how he himself felt, but he could only think, or imagine, what others felt, and never really know. The next day in the morning, before Cuco and Lulo left for Cuco’s granny’s house, for the Thanksgiving holiday, Lulo asked Cuco why he had called him so many times. Cuco answered that it was because he wanted Lulo to save him. Lulo found this curious because he did not know what Cuco wanted to be saved from.   Thanksgiving Day came. Lulo spent this Thanksgiving holiday away from his family for the first time. He spent it with his Cuco’s family. He enjoyed his Cuco’s family. He thought it was so nice that he was able to know his Cuco, meet his Cuco’s family, and spend the Thanksgiving holiday with them. This was so good. He was so happy. And then the holiday was over and he went back to school. For some reason, Cuco and Lulo did not have any passionate lovemaking. Lulo was unsure of why, but he attributed it to their busy schedules. He thought that perhaps when his classes were done, he would have more leisure time and be better able to make time for lovemaking with Cuco.   Lulo tried to focus on his classes. He did not know what it was that kept distracting him from his studies. He thought perhaps that it might be the lack of lovemaking. He tried and tried not to think about this lack of lovemaking… this lack of love? He did not want to think such things. He tried and tried to keep it out of his mind, but would be haunted by it during the day when his mind wandered, and at night when they slept next to each other. There were other excuses for why they might not be making love. Lulo thought that perhaps it was also the incessant partying and the daily hangovers. They partied often after Thanksgiving Day.   It was party after party and then Cuco’s 40th birthday came. Cuco’s birthday was on the 15th of December. Lulo had a surprise party for him on the 14th. Lulo was so happy and so loved his Cuco. Cuco was so surprised. He told Lulo that no one had ever done that for him and he was very touched. He even cried when he said this and Lulo cried as well. Lulo was so in love with his Cuco at this point. Cuco could never know this, or so Lulo thought. Cuco could never know how Lulo was so very much in love with him. Then on the 15th there was another party. More parties followed. December was just full of parties. Lulo attributed this, also, to the reasons why they had not made love in so long.   Christmas Eve came and Cuco went to Lulo’s mother’s house where they both spent their time happily. On Christmas Day, Lulo gave Cuco a present. Cuco gave Lulo several presents. They were both happy. And then they went to Cuco’s granny’s house again. On their way to Cuco’s granny’s house, Cuco said something that Lulo found curious. Lulo asked him where he went on Christmas Eve morning because Cuco had left Lulo alone in bed very early that morning. Cuco said he’d been to the lakeshore to watch the sun rise. Cuco explained that on the lakeshore, there is a Catholic chapel. On this chapel on the lake, there is a spot with five circles on the ground, facing the lake. There is one circle in the middle and four around it. There, Cuco said, he had stood in the central circle and had prayed to the lake. Lulo wondered about this. Lulo thought this was quite curious. Lulo teasingly asked if the lake forgave one’s sins. Cuco said that the lake did not forgive, it absorbed. This left Lulo puzzled. Lulo thought, “What sins do  you  have?” But again, these curious things that Cuco said were forgotten and Lulo simply stored them in his mind for when he might need to recall them. They continued to drive on to Cuco’s granny’s house.   They had spent their Thanksgiving holiday at Cuco’s granny’s house, and now they were spending their Christmas holiday there as well and Lulo thoroughly enjoyed himself, but in the back of his head was his yearning for lovemaking. His yearning and his desire to feel his Cuco’s body and to make love were always on his mind. He always wanted his Cuco and loved him very much.   Christmas passed and New Years Eve came and then New Years Day. Each of those days was a party. There was one party after another. Cuco said something funny to his father, who stayed with Cuco and Lulo over the New Years holiday. He said that he had been partying so much, that he had not had one moment for a serious thought. Lulo overheard this. This sentiment was intriguing to Lulo. Lulo thought it was curious.   Cuco then seemed like he wanted things to go back to normal. He wanted to continue his Spanish lessons and so he wanted Lulo to help him by having “Spanish Breakfast” with him. Lulo was pleased to do it. Lulo wanted, more than anything, for his Cuco to be pleased with him.   On the fifth of January, of the New Year, Cuco got up quite early. He asked Lulo whether he wanted some coffee. Lulo said, “Claro que si mi amorsito!” which can translate from Spanish into, “Of course my love.” They sat together, early that morning in January and Cuco told Lulo that they would not be having “Spanish Breakfast” that morning. Lulo wondered why. Cuco said he had a story to tell Lulo, and that he might not like it, but that he thought that perhaps this story had a happy ending. This would become the saddest moment of Lulo’s life. Cuco confessed to him that earlier the previous year, before Thanksgiving, on the night when Lulo’s friend who’d been to the military came to their home, he had an ephemeral evening of lovemaking.   Lulo began to cry. Lulo could not contain himself. Lulo was incredibly sad. Lulo could not see Cuco. Lulo was hurt and he cried because he could not otherwise describe how painful Cuco’s confession was to him. Lulo thought that perhaps Cuco told him because he no longer loved him. Lulo thought that Cuco wanted to kill Lulo and that he was carrying out Lulo’s murder by this confession. Cuco told Lulo that he had to tell him, not to hurt him, but because it was true and because he wanted, and he was so pathetic as he said this, to build a happy life together without any secrets.   That day was the saddest day in Lulo’s life. The gargoyle had known. The gargoyle knew what was good and what wasn’t, even before it entered the happy house of Cuco and Lulo. Now the little house of Cuco and Lulo was no longer happy. It was a sad little house. Cuco and Lulo were both very sad.   Lulo told Cuco that he could not stay in the house that day and asked Cuco to leave him some money. Lulo waited for Cuco to leave. After Cuco left, Lulo left him a little note, showered and changed, and then left, without taking one thing that he did not absolutely need. Lulo went walking through the city streets. He cried and cried at intervals. He looked for sanctuary in a Catholic church, and found that none offered sanctuary. He thought he should throw himself into the river or the lake. He got a message on his phone from a friend. He met her later and got drunk at her house. She wanted Lulo to talk to her, but Lulo only wanted to get drunk and to forget about the bad thing at that moment in his life. Lulo could not stay there and decided he would go to a bar instead.   At the bar, he saw a few people, had a nice time, and drunk a bit more than he usually did. He felt better this way, but this terrible thing was always in the back of his mind. He got a message on his phone from another friend, Jerry. This was the perfect friend to see at a time like this. Jerry had also experienced infidelity. He and his boyfriend Edgar had been through this similar thing and survived. Lulo was not very conscious that night. They picked him up from the bar and took him to their place. He fell asleep on their couch. The next day they went to work. Lulo lied on the couch the entire day. Then Jerry and Edgar’s roommate, John, came home from work and Lulo thought he would leave then, since there was finally someone to lock the door after him.   Lulo thought that he would go home but he quickly changed his mind. Instead of going home, he went to a café where he read a play entitled Elutheria, written by Samuel Beckett. He liked his play. He felt like the character Victor in the play. Now he thought that he might go back home but instead he walked by a bar and went inside. He drank two big hard drinks. He then thought that he was well enough to go home. He could not face Cuco sober and he was now drunk enough to go home. He was on his way home and he decided to check his messages on his phone. Jerry had left him another message. Jerry wondered if Lulo did not want to join him and Edgar for dinner in a restaurant by Lulo’s house. Lulo immediately called them back and told them he would join them. Lulo was glad at this diversion from having to go back home.   So Jerry and Edgar acted like the most beautiful and good friends that a person can ever have. They took Lulo to eat at the restaurant where he had his first real meal in two days. Jerry spoke eloquently about infidelity and helped Lulo to feel so much better. Lulo felt that he had sobered up and that he needed another drink before he went home, so he asked his good friends to take him to a bar. They did, and Lulo drank again and finally he felt well enough to go home.   Lulo asked Jerry to call Cuco, to tell him that he was taking Lulo home. Cuco answered the phone, as late as it was, and spoke briefly with Jerry. Jerry said he thought Cuco sounded very worried. Lulo simply listened to this. Jerry and Edgar took Lulo home in their car. They arrived and told Lulo to be brave. Lulo got out of the car, went through the front door, up the stairs, and while he was still going up the stairs, Cuco came out of the door looking very pathetic and sorry. Lulo did not care. Lulo was disgusted. Cuco had started making some tea. He offered Lulo some tea and Lulo accepted. Lulo sort of collapsed on the kitchen floor. They both sat on the kitchen floor and talked and cried. Cuco tried to comfort Lulo, but Lulo would not be comforted. Lulo told Cuco he was disgusted. Lulo slept alone that night on the couch because he did not want to sleep next to Cuco. Cuco was disgusting at those moments.   The next day came and went and then it was night. Lulo wondered what he would do. Lulo still loved his Cuco. He told him so. He wanted to be normal again. He wanted to be a normal couple again. He craved a normal life. How could they be normal again? Lulo thought that the only way this could happen would be to go back to the normalcy of the beginning of their happy life together and to start again and do things together so that Lulo could again achieve a sense of normalcy.   Lulo would not forgive anyone and he thought that one should not regret anything one did. One simply had to accept what one or another person did, and move on. Lulo wondered what the point of forgiveness really was. It was pointless as far as he was concerned. It served no meaningful end.   Lulo also thought of something else. Lulo thought that perhaps it would be wise to write a story of his experience with Cuco. It didn’t matter to him how painful it would be to relive these things in the retelling. It did not matter to him how terrible it had been. He had to get it down on print. He had to tell this story.   And so, Lulo set himself to work. He started to write his story from the beginning, when he met Cuco, to the present and perhaps into the future. If you cannot tell by now, the story that you are now reading was written by Lulo. “Perhaps,” he wondered to himself, “it might be good therapy.”   It took him several days to finish. In the meantime, Cuco and Lulo got to work and started to do normal things together. Lulo loved grocery shopping and cooking and eating dinner and watching a good video with his Cuco. Inside, Lulo still felt the pain. He was brave and hid it and did as many normal things with his Cuco as he could. They even made love and enjoyed it more than ever. Cuco thought Lulo was beginning to look OK and that things were getting back to normal for him and Lulo. But finally one night, Lulo finished his story. Cuco had fallen asleep on his chair and Lulo thought that he would give it to Cuco before he left for work the next day.   Please keep in mind that this story is being told to you by Lulo himself and that perhaps he wrote some of this before it actually happened, knowing that it would. The day after the night in which Lulo finished his story, he gave it to Cuco before Cuco left for work and told Cuco to read the story on the train. Lulo set himself to work, hoping that things would turn out as he desired. Lulo filled the bathtub with warm water. He denuded himself and placed himself in it. Next to him, he had placed a very sharp knife. He soaked in the warm water for a little while and cried. Finally he took the knife and slit his wrists. The blood flowed from his wrists and made the water an awful crimson red.   Cuco read this on the train, on his way to work. He was stunned. He thought that perhaps Lulo would not do such a terrible thing. Lulo had told Cuco that he would visit his mother that day. Cuco did not know for certain. That is the point. One never knows what another is feeling or thinking for certain. Cuco thought it was crazy but he got off the train and called the house. No one answered the phone. Then Cuco called Lulo’s mobile phone. There was no answer. Cuco got off the train he was on at the next stop and took a cab back home. When he arrived at home, he walked in the house and ran to the washroom where he found Lulo’s body in the bathtub filled with blood red water. Now Cuco could not believe what he was seeing, it was so awful. Cuco called the ambulance.   Lulo wanted Cuco to tell his family that he loved them very much, and that he was very sorry for everything he had done. Lulo wanted Cuco to know that he loved him very much, but that after this very bad thing in his life, it was hard to live. He could no longer live, and this was why he took his own life.   The gargoyle showed no emotion on his face that day. He neither smiled nor frowned. He kept a straight face. But a tear did drop from his cold stone eye. And this is a very sad thing indeed, if it made a thing made of stone shed a tear.
