Because I'd like to be tangent to your curves!You and I would add up better than a Riemann sum.My love for you is a monotonic increasing function of time.Wanna come back to my room and see my copy of Euclid's "Elements"?I am equivalent to the Empty Set when you are not with me.      MATH DICTIONARY   The Dictionary: what mathematics professors say and what they mean by it  Clearly: I don't want to write down all the "in-between" steps. Trivial: If I have to show you how to do this, you're in the wrong class. It can easily be shown: No more than four hours are needed to prove it. Check for yourself: This is the boring part of the proof, so you can do it on your own time. Hint: The hardest of several possible ways to do a proof.Brute force: Four special cases, three counting arguments and two long inductions.Elegant proof: Requires no previous knowledge of the subject matter and is less than ten lines long.Similarly: At least one line of the proof of this case is the same as before.Two line proof: I'll leave out everything but the conclusion, you can't question 'em if you can't see 'em. Briefly: I'm running out of time, so I'll just write and talk faster. Proceed formally: Manipulate symbols by the rules without any hint of their true meaning. Proof omitted: Trust me, It's true.     ROMANCE MATHEMATICS   Smart Man + Smart Woman = Romance Smart Man + Dumb Woman = Affair Dumb Man + Smart Woman = Marriage Dumb Man + Dumb Woman = Pregnancy      SEX vs GYM   who said that you have to go to the gym to lose some calories.!!!!!It has been known for many years that Sex was good exercise, but until now nobody had made a scientific study of the caloric content of different sexual activities.
