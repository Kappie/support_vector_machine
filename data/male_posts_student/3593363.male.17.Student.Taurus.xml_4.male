After that i went over to Aarons, then me and Lindsey L got a movie (neverwatched it). Then the funny part- Dan was like "i want pancakes" so i made some. Then I went to pick up Allie H. and we went back to Aarons to chill. She gave me an envelope, and it had 16 envelopes, with each day of my trip marked on them, that is the sweetest thing anyone has ever done for me. I really am unworthy of such a friend and she didnt have to do that.so now I'm going for 16 days, backpacking in Philmont, near cimmiron New Mexico. It's gonna be a blast and i'm bringing my video camera.
