In pure coinicidence,  Yesod ,the foundation, is represented in human anatomy by the phallus. (That's right girls, we have one more element of god than you do:P)  Now, Yesod is the medium for Tifaret(beauty) to unite with (actually, to try to unite with, which is important) Shekninah,(God's kingdom, the world we live in). The perverted of us cabbalistic acolytes(me), will notice that Tifaret is represented by the chest(yes, beauty is in the chest, god said so, tough luck girls who don't want breast implants) and Shekninah by the mouth(which is so cool and I don't want to get into why right now.) This means that the male phallus is a channel for the chest to connect with the mouth. Oh my! That's right everyone. The Tree of Life says that our world exists due to God having oral sex.   I'm a hippy. Oh well, at least I mentioned sex at least once in this post.
