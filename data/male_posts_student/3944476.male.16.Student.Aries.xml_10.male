It sucks, but they try to make it fun by addin like 30 min of playtime where we got to sit down and play with old and outdated action figures. Still remember singin stupid songs like "A-B-C-D...." Bleah. U know the rest. 2 years wasted. How stupid. Then came primary skool, another 5 years wasted. Spent like 5 min everyday singin the NATIONAL ANTHEM as if it was so important. [5 min X 5 days a week X 4 weeks a day X 10 months of skool a year = 1000 min a year!!!] Hecks. Then now i'm in secondary skool, another 4 years. Then either JC (2years, then 4years in university) or Poly (3years). So i'll probably spend 18 years of my life studying. Shitz, wished i was a buddha, meditate 24/7.  Well, there's a sayin that goes "If u fail to plan, u're plannin to fail." Yes, whoever made up this quote must be weak in English. So, I've decided to plan out what i'm gonna do for the rest of time in SJI.  1. Study for O levels. 2. Try out Japanese food (Not sure whether HALAL or not) 3. Play in the GYM (as in the gymnasts shits) without gettin busted. 4. Steal soccer/rugby/hockey/hand balls. 5. Call KEFLI a LOSER so loud that he'll hear me. 6. After that, possibly get a PINK/YELLOW form. 7. Fake illness, get a BLUE form. 8. Steal the SJI flag. 9. Sneak into the teachers' toilet and pee all over the floor. 10. Pass my O levels with flyin colours.  HECKS MAN. Don't wanna turn out to be like a nerd by time i leave SJI. Scared i'll be like my brother, studies till 4am on weekends. Crazy boy. I don't think being smart is just memorisin ur facts, i think it's about logic and understandin. So if anyone who reads this is a nerd, I know that they're plenty out there, give yourself a kick in the ass. And those who're cool like me,(yeah rite), congrats and u may buy yourself a lollypop.
