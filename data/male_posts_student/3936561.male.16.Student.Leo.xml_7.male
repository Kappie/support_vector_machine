In other news, a "professional" lacrosse team will be coming to Minnesota, and fans are voting on the best name: the Thrill, the Rush, the Swarm, or the Bullheads. Why bullheads? No one likes them. If they wanted a Minnesota fish, they should have chosen Walleyes or Pike. Also, Sen. John Edwards, the VP candidate, is coming near, and I plan on going to the rally there. And I spent 6 hours yesterday and beat all but the last level of Unreal Tournament on my Dreamcast. As well, I ordered a copy of Beyond Good and Evil for PC and a memory card for the Dreamcast. And I bought The Postal Service's CD,  Give Up , which is quite good. Later!
