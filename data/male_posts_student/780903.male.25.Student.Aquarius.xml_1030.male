W4M -- You were ten minutes late to Con Law.  I grabbed an outline for you.  You looked sexy when you raised your hand.  I was hoping to get a peek at your notes and see what I missed when I went to the bathroom, but your laptop was turned a little too much to the left.  Maybe during the ten-minute break tomorrow you can explain rational basis review to me?  W4MMW -- Looking for some moot court action.  Any teams of three need a fourth?  I'm versatile.  W4M -- You were standing in front of me on line at the counseling center.  I was the one with the cuts on my wrists; you had the empty pill bottle and the vacant look in your eyes.  I think you're cute.  T4TTT -- Saw the three of you studying Torts in the student center at 6AM Wednesday.  Hoping I can join your study group.  I got a B+ in Property last semester.  And already have half an outline.  M4W -- I keep seeing you at the career services orientations.  Baggy sweatshirt, no makeup, dark circles under your eyes.  Are you as confused as I am about this whole process?  I'd love to trade resumes sometime and get your feedback.  P4S -- You sit in the second row of my evidence class.  I haven't called on you yet.  You make me nervous.  You have really pretty eyes.  My wife's out of town next weekend.  Any interest in "office hours" ??  M4M -- Never taken a practice exam with another guy before, but I'm curious how it would feel.  Drug/disease free.  C4C -- I saw you mailing your clerkship applications the other day, at the post office.  I was the guy with the box full of envelopes.  I'd love to know what judges you've heard back from.  I'm still waiting for my first interview.  Hope you're doing better.  I hear the third circuit is hot this year.  I think you're hot too.  W4MMM -- Looking for a bunch of cute guys to tie me to a chair and quiz me with flash cards for the Bar Exam.  Nothing too kinky, just the multi-state section.  S4P -- I sit in the second row of your evidence class.  You haven't called on me yet.  Maybe your wife'll be out of town soon and we can have some "office hours."  I have a "paper topic" I'd like to "talk" to you about.  It involves "a recent tax court decision" about "deductions" and I was hoping you could "point me to some introductory reading material" so that I can "write up an outline."  M4W -- Saw you crying in the cafeteria.  I cry too sometimes.  Maybe we can cry together.  I'm part of a support group where we all get together and cry every once in a while.  It's fun.
