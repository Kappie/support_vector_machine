It may look small and insignifigant, but it is a deep burn and hurts like hell, if I hadn't been wearing a shirt, my whole arm would be like that..and yes, you guess it, I am really just doing this as an excuse to show me topless...but I will tell the entire story of that crazy night in my next post, stay tuned. urlLink
