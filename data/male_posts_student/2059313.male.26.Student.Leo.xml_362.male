Okay, now that we're done with that, I just wanted to say I did a couple of quick edits to the page so that it will look basically the same no matter who views it.  The proportions will all be the same for anybody.  People with higher screen resolutions will just see more blue to the right side of the sidebar than others.  Hope you enjoy reading every now and then, keep coming back, you make it all worthwhile.  I'll get more  Past Weeks  events posted soon.
