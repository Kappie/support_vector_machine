But as usual my laziness has resulted in procrastination more often than not. Thanks to my friend Venkat , I finally pulled up my socks and both of us enrolled in French classes leading to CFE at Alliance Francaise today.                                     I have always admired the richness of the french language ( Though the language I would have loved to learn is Urdu !!) and am glad that finally I am making some progress towards it.
