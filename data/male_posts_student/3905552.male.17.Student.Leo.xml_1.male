(but i also contribute to the game design) i'll be looking forward to when we come to start on Sophies quest along side another game death 8, but in the meantime, im working on another brilliant game called Conquer.  one thing i enjoy most about the SQ project is coming up with the island designs, and im especially looking forward to designing areas in more detail. i have loads of brilliant ideas.  I just love designing those small nucks and crannies in areas, which make the game explorations more fun, as I hate it when things get too repetitive. to get around this im gonna try and get the different areas to have their own personalities. and own aspects about them.  when your walking through a forest, it wont look like your walking past that same tree over and over just by having cleverly thought layouts and unique features.  I certainly have high hopes for this game, and am sure its going to be a brilliant experience. we have a good team, and am sure when things get rolling , they will carry on.  lets just hope seans ten million other projecs wont get i his way.
