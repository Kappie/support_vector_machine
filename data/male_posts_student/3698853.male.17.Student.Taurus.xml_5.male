Anyways, I guess this will be my new home *snuggles in as only a whale can*. I just love how the safety valve theory applies to the internet in such a way. Not much happens in my life, and I doubt I will retain the conviction to make entries regularly, especially when the school year starts.  For now, this will simply have to do. Where to start? Well, first off, my summer plans are as follows:......---and that's all. However, I wanted to get my driver's license, do some drawing, work on my summer assignments, volunteer service, improve my 400 meter time, and apply for a summer job. Nice summer, huh? Well, that's the way the penguin plummets. -So yeah, my grades are down the toilet, not that I can help it much now anyways. I got my SAT I scores back a while ago, I tested average. Tim got a 1520 *green-eyed monster* haha... no, I'm happy for him. Didn't get accepted as an NHS officer, but that's to be expected. Even though I say I think it was because it's rigged, and they're all Nazis, I truly believe that I didn't have a sexy-enough résumé or teacher recommendations ('cuz we all know what those would say don't we? ô_o). I'm still directonless in life. Don't know what I want to be, don't know which college I want to go to, don't know anything  about  college. For the past, what?, eight or nine years, about which all my life has revolved is school. and what for? I couldn't tell you. I guess the best thing I thought I could do was appear as good as possible so that when the time came to decide, I wouldn't be a mess. -You know, before, I never considered Track  Field my "thing." Never whole-heartedly dedicated myself to it, but it's given me so much that I thought I ought to see what else it could do for me. This coming school year will be interesting to say the least. The anticipatory anxiety is enough to make me go insane, not to mention that AP exam results are coming in July. Seriously, I don't know why we put ourselves through so much stress. I quit tae kwon do and jazz a while ago. I never appreciated them so much as I do now. Colleges will look at my application and see my junior year: I quit a good deal of extracurriculur activities and STILL didn't make good grades. It's enough to make a cetacean grow tear ducts and cry. That's all for now, not that you were ever interested before in any case. ~SPAMU
