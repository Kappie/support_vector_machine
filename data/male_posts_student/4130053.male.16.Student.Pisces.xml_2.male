I have been shopping, bought my Sister's   iPod   and 12 packs of   Juicy Fruit.   I am loving all of the shops around here! I also got my   fido   sim card so I can make cheap calls.  So I've been listening to Mercury FM and Capital FM - sad I know but I can't get a radio station with all of the music I like on. The Beat and Z 95.3 are good, but I need UK music!! Hahaha. I'm listening to Mercury as I speak!  I'm off to shoot some golf balls at the Driving Range shortly. Tomorrow I'm off to the BC Lions vs Ottawa Renegades match at the BC Place Stadium, Vancouver - I'm really looking forward to that! There is a street party before which looks fun.  On Saturday, I'm hopefully going to the Much Music Xbox Unleashed show at City TV, Vancouver - this looks like I'm gonna see all of the latest games revealed! Also I'm going to the Yaletown festival which should be fun!  OMG I'm a criminal - I stood with 1 foot in USA and the other in Canada yesterday! hahaha!
