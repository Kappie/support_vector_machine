I'm kinda nervous, but more just eager to get it over with, so i can finally stop worrying about it.    School was boring as usual....since theres like 3-4 weeks left of school, everyone is doing NOTHING.....i'm gonna miss the seniors though, they were a hell-of-a-class.  ya.... Um, what else...shit, can';t think of anything.  talked to czank, we sehdualed (a know thats wrong) a LAN party at his house the 28th....he'll keep me posted though.    O yah, today is senior prom, mad seniors, and others are going to prom......crazy....  my car is breaking down, and i can;t stop it...  god damn, this is my 50th post, and this turned out to be the shittiest one...go figure? (i'll write more later....i m feeling to wierd right now....)
