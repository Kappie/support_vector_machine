Hehe I made it sound like my eating habits."Well, I haven't eaten in two days, and I am not really doing anything now, so I might as well." Anyway where are we meeting monday morning and when? Today I finally worked off all those demerits that I got during the school year. But I still have to go to Legal Outreach tomorrow, but they are paying me tomorrow. Don't know how much though, probably not much since I would probably be considered cheap child labor... Well Goodbye all.
