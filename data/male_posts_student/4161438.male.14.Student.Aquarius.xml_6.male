She was going on about it was her fault that her cousin's dog died or something. And it pissed me off. Why? Because she always feels  something  is her fault. Always.  So I told her to stop. And I think I was rather mean in doing so. And now I am twitching. I think its all the sugar I had not to long ago. (Massive amounts, I assure.) But I said fuck a bit more than I ought to, and I think I said one word that should have been a different word. 'Love' was 'like.' I liked her, I didn't love her. And I don't know if that's right. I really don't. I am confused. Very confused. In any case, she said she had to sleep. And she logged off.  But wasn't I saying the right thing? I don't know. I think I was, but maybe it didn't come out right. I'm an idiot for having closed that chatlog, and deleting it forever. And she's probably home crying. Why? Because I am a fucking asshole who smashed her for thinking she killed her dog while she was at her cousin's. And I hate that she would blame herself for that. She couldn't stop it. No one could. Maybe when I'm a bit less confused I might say something else. Bye.
