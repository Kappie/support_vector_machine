Simply put: Canadians have awesome powers.    And I know this is known to those who travel abroad, as it's just good sense to pretend you're from Canada, but it also has wonderful uses right here in the US.    So, I somehow ended up on this search committee for a new faculty member and one of the candidates is from Canada.  She was boring and condescending, her theory was not nearly as revolutionary as she believed it to be, and her educational background didn't qualify her for the position.  Despite all this she was the undergrad's candidate of choice, and all of them cited her Canadian background as the quality that set her apart from and above the other candidates.  Sure one of them already has a deal to publish her dissertation and the other has actually been teaching at the school for 5 years.  This one's from Canada (ok, the other major selling point was her stay in Thailand of unspecified length, an experience so horrific she sought refuge in grad school).  In reflecting on her boring lecture about the useless theory she stole I realized something else: the two moments of levity and joy in the room were connected to her Canadian-ness.  First the lady introducing her misspoke and told us all she was a specialist in Canadian bacon (she thought she'd said "banking", then she thought she'd said "baking").  Then about halfway through her talk she "accidentally" let out an "eh" at the end of the sentence.   I believe it was these two incidents that overwhelmed the undergrads.  Bringing me to a point, which I usually have.  Try to be more Canadian.  If the bitchy waitress from the bar the other night was Canadian I might not have hated her (I'm not immune to their powers).  If this theory-stealing boring woman was not Canadian she wouldn't have this job locked-in.  Heck, if she were Mexican we'd totally boot her ass back south seeing as she's about to take away one of our jobs.   This brings me to a suggestion, which I always have.  I think it might be a good idea to give Canadians darker skin.  That way their whole economy will collapse and nobody will help them.  With a collapsed economy they'll start spreading all over the place, pissing everyone off, and they'll lose this magical quality they currently possess.  And they really are magical beings because it didn't work when we tried to blame a couple mad cows on Canadian farms.  I'm also pretty sure there's a town in Wisconsin (Michigan?) that wants to join them and we can't be giving up territory like that.    It's up to you, scientists.  Prove your worth by taking out the Canadians.  Before it's too late.
