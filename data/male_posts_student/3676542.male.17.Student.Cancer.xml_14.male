A group of us (Stan, Daniel, Boon and me) Find ourself a place A place that will have a great view of the wonderful display..  YESH!the time came. It came without notice The banging sound of the explosive chemicals Brings along the cheering of the crowds Up above, the spectacular colour in the dark sky.. One after another Turning a dull, plain sky Into a fabulous,marvellous Fireworks painting..  I could say,the finale isn't at the end. It's the part where the fireworks *BANGS* nonstop for bout 30sec or so.. that's the nices part of the event.. I could stop wow-ing when the wonderful sparkles last for so long.. Each bangs,came along with cheering and wow-ing from me and of cos the crowd..  The Fujifilm S5000 digicam of boons' is damn clear. Why? Imagine stand along the bay of the theatre Taking a shot of THE ORIENTAL. You got still see the people inside, and what's their clothing.. We spotted one red pants,two couple having dinner.. :P I bet boon have been doing some PI(private investigator) work.. Be careful everyone..haha ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Ok, we stayed at the bay for sometime Had burger before we went to meet kim leong at the lau pak sak(the burger was nice) Our first suggestion is to take MRT yet Dan say walk.. We walk bout 30+ min den reach the Market. Took a wrong route to raffles..due to some of my mistake, and some of Dan's mistake and some of Boon's mistake. Why Stan no mistake?He was not leading us or guiding us..he just followed.. Ok,let's not blame any one for "Who's fault is it?"
