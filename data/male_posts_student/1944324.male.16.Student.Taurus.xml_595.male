Erin has been the most sensible so far.  These issues are between Michael and Marten, and I would prefer they find another way to fight it out without screwing up the blog for the rest of us.  BTW, who wrote the new description?  I like it. Anyway, it occurred to me that a bunch of blog-worthy stuff has happened to me lately that I haven't written because of the nonsense.  For instance, all the tornados on Sunday.  We were in the basement for around two hours ,[Ha! I was in a leaky fallout shelter for about half an hour. It would be nifty if I wasn't pissed about still being there-Marten]  and they came right over us.  Luckily none of them touched down, but we were pretty worried.  It got to the point where we were stashing our valuables in the basement.  Then on Monday, following a note from my grandma's mother, we found her grandfather's grave.  For those of you not keeping track, that's my grandma's great grandfather or my great great great grandfather, Jacob Tanner Snyder, who fought in the civil war.  Not thrity feet from his grave is that of Richard Gattling, inventor of the first automatic weapon - the gattling gun.  And less than a mile away is our shortest running president, William Henry Harrison. So that was pretty cool.  It's not every day you track down a 150 year old relative.  I think I don't know I think I know I dont think I know I think I dont think I know I think....
