Sure the trig exam and the physics exam were harder than the english section (470 ouch!) of the SAT for me, but it's all good.  Summer's cool cause there's so much stuff you can do. Fun in the sun is coming up like mustard on a bun you can't stop it, no not none, so now i'm done.  You can do fun things as much as you want, and you can also grow closer to God!  That would make it a truly beneficial summer wouldn't it?  I mean if this summer was going to mean anything at all in eternity, it would mean us growing closer to God. Keep that at the back of your mind, I know it's going to be really hard for me since i'm so busy, but make this summer a great one!  Sum are hard but summer's easy.... Keep it real, I'm Will
