Pam calls partylines all the time and she went to see one of the people that she met in the partyline and knew next to nothing about. Sonya called her mom, other people, and I think she called the police to help look for her because of this stunt that she pulled.     Obviously they found her before anything happened to her. The police thanked her and Demarco for calling, and her mom put her on punishment because Pam told her mom that Sonya gave her the partyline number {although sonya never even calls partylines}.  Now Sonya is ticked off because she actually cared enough to actually call those people to look for her sister, when she could've just let her go and they would find her dead somewhere in a ditch or raped. But she's still in trouble and she has to put up with being on punishment because she cared and wanted to protect Pam from harm.   I'm really disappointed in Pam because I never thought that she would actually lie on her sister the way she did and get her in trouble for something she didn't do just so she would go down with her.
