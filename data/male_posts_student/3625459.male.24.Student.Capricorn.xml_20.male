Tried calling her up today, but both my calling cards were outta money . Now how on earth did that happen.Im sure i spent no more than 25 minutes waiting for that call from the Department of work which is a 0870 number . Lifes a rip off isnt it ? Least my life is My cell has no credit i cant even give her a missed call.      Song : Wasting Time Artist : BLINK 182   Sometimes I sit at home and Wonder if she's sitting at home Thinking of me and wondering if I'm Sitting at home, thinking about her Or am I just wasting my time   Started my work today got the damn thing to serialize, next step got to make use of multi threading   Points to ponder :                                                 I will begin this thesis                                 and i will finish                                     school.                             I wont miss C     and                              I will go to Canada
