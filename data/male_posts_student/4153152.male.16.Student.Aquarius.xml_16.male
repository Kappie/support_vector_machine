Right now, I'm just letting the creative engine go forth on idle while I work out some details and become familiar with the music. Once I'm synced up with the music, the movie making should go much easier. I'm listening to Hector's Death over and over, getting ideas of how I want to set it up. The very first part of the movie where this plays will be very crucial to catch the attention of an audience. When we shift into the action sequence with Backseat Driver, it will be less important. I really can't wait to get going on this.  I'm going over some of our scene selections right now, and I think that plenty of work still needs to be done, but no surprises there. The only major thing I really want to spend some time mending is the transitional phase between scenes 2, 3, and 4. Granted, we've only gotten to the very basics for scene 3, and barely any on 4. However, even now it seems very rough. Literally pulled along by the threads of rock music and pushed by some intuitive fades. With time, with time.
