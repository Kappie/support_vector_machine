Anyhow, I got to talk to Jake *smiles* I can't wait to be with him. He's absolutely amazing. I love you Jacob Robert Brown! *blows a kiss* lol. As you can tell, yea I'm in a better mood. I'll be in an even better mood if I can get some damn hair dye tonight. Black. Again! My roots are showing and it's suckin ass right now. Ugly reddish brown hair of mine. *gags* Hmm...did anything interesting happen today...? Oh that little Kayley whore that I go to school with kept looking at me. I think she's just going out with T.J. for attention. Oh well, eventually he'll see the real her. A preppy, stuck-up, little whore that thinks she can get whatever she wants whenever she wants it. I hope he's happy with that. But him and I are still cool...I think. He hasn't really talked to me since they started hanging out. Yeah, well, what should I expect? I duno if Brendan and that Mary Charles(M.C.) chick are gona go out or not. I hope not. She doesn't deserve him. She talks shit about everyone. But oh well, whatever blows his skirt up. lol. Back to Jake though. I wish I was his girlfriend or something. We may as well go out, we act like it already. He treats me like I'm a princess...I love it! lol. Well, I'm gonna go email some of my peeps and get some pizza. Later!  Love to those who care, Mandy
