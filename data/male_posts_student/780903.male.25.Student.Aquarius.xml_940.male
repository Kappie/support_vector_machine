I want to take back my comment below that the law review article I read yesterday may have been overstating the success of Billy Beane's approach in Moneyball.  Read this speech and you'll be worshipping at the idol of DePodesta.  But read it quick, because it was pulled from its site and lives only in Google's cache.  So hurry!
