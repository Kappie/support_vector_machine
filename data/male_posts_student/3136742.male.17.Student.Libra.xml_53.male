He's got to be the most dramatic sonofabitch in the world. When he's a little cold he makes it seem like he's been dying of brain cancer. He's got a case of the Green Apple Splatters now, and he's talking with absolutely no tone or energy, like he's dying--Ever see The Count of Monte Cristo? Remember when Abbe Faria died and his lungs were punctured, and he was talking all wispery like he couldn't breathe? That's how my dad's talking, only he's worse... He walks around like an old man, mumbling everything and trying to make it look like he's been on chemo or something... he's such a pussy. --- I love the speaker setup on my computer... It's so badass... 2 sets of Cambridge  Soundworks speakers (4 Mid/Tweeters, and 2 POWERFUL subwoofers) and a $400 set of JBL media 4's (2 pro-audio speakers with super-high tweeters and  mids on each, and a bigass sub)... I am happy... but they could be better...muahahahah. [dork]  NP: Umphrey's McGee (greatest Prog-Rock/Hard Rock band of all time)- Anchor Drops (new album)
