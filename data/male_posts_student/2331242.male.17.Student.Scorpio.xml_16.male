I mean, the program was almost  dead  a few years ago, and to start over again with a classload of freshmen(who, by the way, did manage to get their act together) and play the way we did was phenomenal. Even better, our director basically gave me a solo bow after the 2nd and 3rd pieces (logical I guess, I had the melody and no trumpet section to back me up), and the audience ate it right up. I got some  very  generous applause. Best of all, Martha was sitting in the 2nd row and saved me a seat :) So after the band had rocked the hizzouse, my girlfriend and I enjoyed the rest of the fabulous concert together. Her host family left her behind after the concert was over, which was kinda sad, considering she's been there for the whole year. But I got to stay and talk to her for an extra half hour, which was awesome of course. Hehe, as you can tell, my ego is soaring. Life is good. Unfortunately, I can count on my AP and math exams to chew up the next week and spit it out. Well, after that it's Christmas, but no Martha... I'd better enjoy these last days as much as possible :)
