Well, here it is, your lyrics:        Hope dangles on a string  Like slow spinning redemption  Winding in and winding out  The shine of which has caught my eye   And roped me in  So mesmerizing, and so hypnotizing  I am captivated   [Chorus]  Vindicated I am selfish  I am wrong  I am right  I swear I'm right  I swear I knew it all along  I am flawed  But I am cleaning up so well  I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself   So clear  Like the diamond in your ring  Cut to mirror your intention  Oversized and overwhelmed  The shine of which has caught my eye  And rendered me so isolated, and so motivated  I am certain now that   Vindicated I am selfish  I am wrong  I am right  I swear I'm right  I swear I knew it all along  I am flawed  But I am cleaning up so well  I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself   So, turn up the corners of you lips  Part them and feel my finger tips  Taste the moment, fall forever Defense is paper thin  Just one touch and I'd be in  Too deep now to ever swim against the current  So let me slip away  So let me slip away So let me slip away So let me slip against the current  So let me slip away So let me slip away So let me slip away So let me slip away  Vindicated I am selfish  I am wrong  I am right  I swear I'm right  I swear I knew it all along  I am flawed  But I am cleaning up so well  I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself   my hope  It dangles on a string  Like slow spinning redemption...     Well, there ya go.  I'll be back later on with your Late Night  Bloggin' updates, with more review and more making fun of other  blogs!  Until then, however...crap, I'm out of witty ending  phrases.  Sorry.
