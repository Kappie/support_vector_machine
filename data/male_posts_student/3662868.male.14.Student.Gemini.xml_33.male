I don't want to grow up and have to get a job and worry about things besides having fun. I'm worrying about too much stuff. I should just relax and enjoy the rest of summer while I can.    Another thing that's on my mind is the lack of storms. We haven't had any big jizznourmous storms that knock out the power and leave the city f'd up the a for a bit. And, if there's any truth to it, a mild/calm summer means a active/cold winter... Or something like that.    I'm just now realizing that all of this time when I haven't been doing work, it's made me really lazy. I need to start going to bed at a decent time, and getting up early, and actually doing something during the day.    Speaking of doing something, I've got to go mow a lawn for some money.    I'll post more later. I'm sure I'll have something. I've got an upset mind right now. The thoughts won't stop churning and popping up.    (Upset mind=Kinda like an upset stomach. Not upset as in sad.)
