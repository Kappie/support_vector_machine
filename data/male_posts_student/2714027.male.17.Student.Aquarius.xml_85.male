In the evening we went over to a BBQ at my friend's house (that's the one who we're taking on holiday and the one I'm going on a gap year with), which was very enjoyable and driving back at night wasn't as scary as I thought it might be.    On Monday I went to work again, this time to get some extra hours, although everyone there wasn't sure why I was there and I felt really unwanted. I spent most of the day sulking around, paranoid at what others were saying - "grr... always taking holiday.... now he's here, trying to earn it back!" - and realising what a crap job it is. Compared with other jobs, I'm overworked and underpaid, so I think I'm going to do something about that come January. Now that I can drive, the range of jobs that I can apply for have grown enormously. I want to work in a book shop or similar, not be stuck out in the rain lifting compost around.     Yesterday I went into town to get my MOT test and a new tax disk for my car. During the two hour wait (while the test was being done) I went for a bit of a walk around the bits of the town that I've never really been round, and took a few photos. Only one was worth putting on DeviantArt, and that's got some good feedback, which is nice to see.    Yesterday afternoon, today and tomorrow is dedicated to getting the new version of Thunderbolt up and running, which I'm looking forward to, so excuse me for now and expect an update later this week.
