The job I've yet to find?  Not so much a concern anymore, and I credit 5-7pm Wednesday.    Nice moment 1-  Weird moment in the park.   I was wondering if I'd run into someone I knew and thinking how nice it was that I don't know very many people (since I was planning to study, or pretend to) so I wouldn't be interrupted.  And up walk two people I know.  Although one of them made a snide remark about this blog (apparently not knowing how much better it is that I expel a few of the thoughts from my head) it was one of those good random moments that make you wonder if you're a little psychic (I thought about them, there they were).  And one of the two people spotted a famous guy, and it's always nice to see celebrities even if they are lead singers from really irritating bands.  Odd, the first time I listened to an entire song by this band was at a bar with these same two people.  Good times.  Nice moment 2- The Prof. So after the random encounter I went to a scheduled one with a prof.  I expected the meeting to be him explaining to me what I wasn't understanding about the class, since he suggested we "talk," but it was actually kinda nice.  It's always fun to hear a professor talk trash about other students in the class, at least until you realize they'll do the same about you at some point in time.   But the meeting went well, despite my brain's steadfast refusal to function, and the best part was he offered, to be my thesis advisor.  About 20 minutes ago I realized how helpful that potentially is, since it means I don't have to worry about finding someone willing to do extra work for very little pay.  I think my faith in NYU is fully restored.  Even if it's bullshit, even if it never pans out, that's one person who's been helpful without prodding or extra financial incentives, and I'm beyond grateful.  It's also encouraged my brain to start refining potential thesis topics, and damned if that isn't exactly what I needed my brain to start doing.  And in a month, gods willing, I'll be in Spain.  So thanks, 5-7pm Wednesday!  And I think I should thank 6am Thursday, too, since that's when all the good things flowed together in my mind.
