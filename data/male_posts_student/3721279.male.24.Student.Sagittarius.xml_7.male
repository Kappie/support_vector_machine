Billy, stop poking Sarah with that pencil!!!!! Right, now that that's taken care of, on to the good stuff. All of you will be required to read "The Celestine Prophecy" by James Redfield this summer. While I've not quite finished it myself yet, so far...  Okay, I can't keep that up anymore. Seriously people, you have to read this book. I'm about 4 chapters into it, and while the fictional (or is it) story itself might not be the most gripping thing, it's the messages woven into the plot that ring true in my life, and will probably do the same for you. The first insight alone in the book is enough to make you question the way you live your life, and just how and why people interact. I'm not trying to get all biblical here, I'm just promoting the expansion of the mind.   Well thanks for stopping by, and listening to my little book promotion. I'm going to go try and be productive...okay maybe not. Bye for now!
