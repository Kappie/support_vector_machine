We are happy , sad , angry , bored , excited , depressed , loving , caring , hateful or vengeful because of what happened long ago or what is happening now .  THe ups and down of our spiritual lives depend on our obedience - that is , our attentive listening - to the movements of the Spirit of God within us . Without this listening our spiritual live eventually becomes subject to the wind-swept waces of our emotions .
