I am currently in one of these moments. Because I had to drink some Mountain Dew for a Psychology project, I'm staying up later than usual. I decided to look on the internet for information about one of my college interests, Calvin. The path God led me on was winding. I went to Calvin, then to their Third World Development section, then to Google to search for more info on the unreached Christians of our world. There I found a link to a group I've been led to before: World Evangeliztion Crusade (WEC). I thought, "What the hey. I'll go there again. Maybe I'll email them for info." Finally, I came to the great site I believe God wanted me to see: http://www.joshuaproject.net/index.php. I am almost crying. God has found some great way of showing me places, peoples to find and minister to. Life is good. God is good. Now I shall read some of the site.
