I almost forgot (how could I). I'm visitingShelly in August/September down in Florida. Hmm.. nothing else has really happened as I haven't left the house since I got back from Josh's. He called me a few times begging me to come over.   Anyway, you can find a little bit about the pedophile busts at  urlLink http://fedorablackwidow.blogspot.com   Mood: satisfied... not really bored, but I'm getting there... as soon as I post this and do my usual internet stuff, check forums and blogs.. etc., I'll be bored.  TV: It's not on... but I fell asleep to that Bruce Willis movie "The Jackal", last night.  Sounds: Just finished listening to Neil Young's After The Goldrush album. Other than that, I hear my own typing and the air conditioning. I don't hear my computer fan as it hasa silent one. Sometimes it's hard to tell if it's running if you don't look at the CPU.
