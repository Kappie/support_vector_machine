Well, it at least kept me from sleeping, haha. More or less got something into this empty brain of mine.    Was supposed to pop by at CS today. But didnt go as a result of Sherman and me couldnt accomodate to each other, he wanted to go play, but i didnt want to, since i, as usual nowadays, couldnt pick up the mood to play. Lost the interest. I justwanted to have a relaxing walk aroundthe two malls, CS and TampinesMall.To top it off, i didnt bring my home clothes either. Ended up going to Superbowl with Benjamin, Joshua, James and William. Sherman went to AMK Zone X to play, alone. Man, hes strong on these stuff, no go and he meant it. Bugger.   Saw Ben and Josh bowl, along with William. Spent my time till 2.30pm when we went to Mac's to catch a bite. Saw Kenneth there, wasnt kinda pleased to see him.. Sheesh. Went home after that, and so tired till i nearly fell asleep on the bus.. although it was a very short trip. Dont know... this fatigue kinda striked on me nowadays.. causing me to doze off into half conscious state whenever i'm inactive.. what's happening...    Another point to add is that i just found out and realised this.. after reading Aaron's blog..that I'm not good at expressing myself. At least if he's got something up his mind, he'll have a reaction to it. Cry, throw temper, whatever. But me, just quiet and moody. Seldom cry nowadays, dont know if i've lost the feeling to even cry.    Yeah i guess thats it for today, watching my favourite Channel U show where u gotta search around for some prize cards.. Basket... one of theparticipants... kept all his 3 cards hidden at home, none was found, and after that at the mall, he got 7 out of 9 cards... total amount of prizes amounting to $10077.. man hes nuts, kinda greedy too...after that i'm doing my homework... felt quite energetic today. Wonder why.   Hope tomorrow will bea finer day. Benedict signing out.
