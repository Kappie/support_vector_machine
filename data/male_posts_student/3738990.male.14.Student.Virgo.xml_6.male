Pin-Head Jack  Copyright; Tony Strauss Email: tonybushpoet@hotmail.com  I was working on the trawlers up in Gladstone some time back, When I met this codger who went by the name of Pin-Head Jack. Nick-names can be descriptive but this one was best of all, 'Cause this guy's head was smaller than a bloody tennis ball.  I wondered how it happened this deformity of his, 'Though it might cause some embarassment if him I was to quiz. One fisherman I asked said "Sorry mate, it's just too sad", Whilst others just replied "That bloke is flamin' raving mad".  Curiosity got the best of me I had to know his tale, And he said that he would tell me, if I purchased him an ale. I went straight to the nearest bar and bought the man a beer, And prepared myself to hear the saddest yarn I'd ever hear.  Old Jack lamented sorely of a time he now regrets, Of the fateful day he once had caught a mermaid in his nets. At first he thought, You beauty! This should buy me lots of beer, I could lease her out to Seaworld for a million bucks a year.  I'll buy myself a dozen pubs and every man I'll shout, I'll be the proudest man in all the world without a doubt. But the mermaid, still entangled, begged him "Sir, please set me free, And just to show my gratitude I'll grant you wishes three"  He thought of his encumbent situation, as it were, he weighed the pros, he weighed the cons, and then replied to her. "My fishing boat is in a poor delapidated mess, And I wish I had a new one so my friends I could impress".  It had happened in an instant, ere the second hand struck one, A brand new spanking trawler was now gleaming in the sun. Well old Jack was quite astounded, over-awed to say the least, This was clearly more impressive than his thoughts of hops and yeast.  Then he started thinking money and he opened up his gob' "Miss, I wish that I were wealthier than Kerry Packer's mob" And just as had occurred before, 'twas over in a flash, His brand new fishing boat was now piled high with wads of cash.  He realised with these riches, debts he would no longer care, But was dumb-struck by her beauty and her flowing locks of hair. "If I could just make love to you would be my final wish" "But Sir" she said "I'm just half girl, the other half is fish".  He pondered for a moment on his plight and then he said, "Well O.K. then, I wish that you'd give me a little head".
