If Portugal loses its curtains for them. If spain loses, the only way though for them is a lost of at least 2 for Greece but seeing how well the Greeks are playing and how poorly the Russians are playing, Spain will definately be playing for the win or a draw. If Portgual vs Spain is a draw, Portgual will be relying on Greece to lose to make it through. Russians are already eliminated so no comment for them.  Match to watch: Spain vs Portgual    Group B  The only way for Switzerland to go through is by beating France 4-0, but I won't be seeing that happen. England vs Croatia is a crunch match, whoever wins goes through and whoever loses its out for them. An England draw should see them through. France only require a draw to get through and even a loss might see them through if England vs Croatia ends in a draw.  Match to watch: England vs Croatia    Group C  1-1 Italy vs Sweden leaves Italy on 2 points after 2 games. They'll (Italy) pull through if they beat Bulgaria and either Sweden or Denmark get a win. But if Sweden vs Denmark is a draw, Italy needs to win at least 2-0 thats if the draw is 0-0 or 1-1, if its 1-1, im not sure whats going to happen because they would be on same goal difference with same amount of wins and the corresponding fixture between them was a draw. Interesting, somebody fill me in on that? You would say Sweden has a good chance of going through but if Denmark wins and Italy wins, they are out :/  Match to watch: Sweden vs Denmark    Group D  Its a bit too early to call, theres only been one game each for them. Even Latvia can win it from this stage. Group of death this group is.  Match to watch: Netherlands vs Czech Republic, this match should help shape the table   Tight groups so far, nobody has that special 6 points after two games.  My tippings for each group:  Group A : Greece and Spain  Group B : France and England  Group C : Sweden and Denmark  Group D : Czech Republic and too early too call
