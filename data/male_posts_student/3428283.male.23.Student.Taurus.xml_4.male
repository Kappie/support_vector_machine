The thing that I'm wondering is whether the sentiment reflected in the poll is the result of the French's criticism of the U.S. was in Iraq. It is sad that current events are being used to devalue the sacrifices that so many made in the past. Regardless of the merits and justifications for the current war in Iraq, it does not change what happened in the past. Just as the French argue that the U.S. had no justification for the current war in Iraq, it can be argued that the U.S. had no obligation or reason to drop thousands and thousands of their own into enemy territory to liberate a country who, while touting themselves to be a "Great Power," utterly failed to protect its own, and saw the enemy march through the streets of Paris. No matter the resentment that the world may feel about the war in Iraq, no one can say that what the U.S., as a nation, and as a people, as well as the British, Canadians, and others of the Allied Forces did on D-Day in Normandy do not deserve the thanks of a nation and perhaps even the world. A question that I want to ask all those who said that there is no debt owed to the U.S. is whether they feel that they owe a debt to anyone for D-Day, and if they feel that they are in debt to the rest of the Allies, what makes the U.S.'s participation in 1944 any less important or deserving?  What is happening in today's world has no impact and makes no difference to what happened in Normandy. For those who feel no debt, think that if not for D-Day, France today would be the province of France, not the Republic of France. Those who died in Normandy did not fight so that they can hold you in debt, but a debt is owed nonetheless.
