Everyone's too busy trading You-jee-ohs.  But, everyone else has one of these dealios.  And, everyone else has a link in their America Online Instant Messenger Information that links people to their ever so interesting web log.  You see, I have already ran into a problem with this web logger.  My sentence above that talks about people putting links in their information was said facetiously.  Now, you don't know that, because you are just reading what the computer screen says.  You could have gotten the idea that I go around reading everyone's blog repeatedly because I find it ever so interesting (which I don't).  This is exactly why I prefer rambling out loud!      Ah well.  So this is my first post onto my web log.  Now, I'm not going to be corny and introduce myself by saying that my name is Justin Kline.  I'm not going to say that I'm from Exira, Iowa.  I'm not even going to tell you my age (which is 13).  Heavens no, that's just too cliched for Justin Kline.  I'll start out my web log by doing something different.  I'll do something which has never been done before.  I'll start off my web log by, um, drinking a glass of water.  . . .      So, um, I'm going to get drink that glass of water.  I'll be back later to post more unneeded details into this newly started web log of mine..  So, um, goodbye.
