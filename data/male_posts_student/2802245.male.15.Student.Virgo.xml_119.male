For the site, I ask Beckett to send me all the .html files in a zip to my gmail, I want to make a few minor changes, such as font consistency, parts of the writing, and some other shit. Dont expectit returned soon, though,maybe in1 or2 days maybe. I'll spend5 minutes a day trying to fixthat all up. Also, all the PCs are the QUB computational PCs my dad has, and he has decided to replace his old networking/try out a new one, with a newswitch, sohe told me(phoned from China) to look at possible configs. I also decidedto reformat the other old athlon 600 pc and install a fresh copy of XP for no reason.   Anyways, theres a slight problem with the forum business. The forum was supposeto be for all 3 sites,  dragon-tail.tk, blackghoststudios.tk  and  dbeckett.co.uk , so it cant be just called " Black Ghost Studios Forum ". It has to be for a name for all three sites' forum. Maybe like " 3Fusion " and the motto " Synthesis of Dragontail's Lair dbeckett.co.uk Black Ghost Studios " or something like that. Go to our current forum mentioned by Beckett below and post ideas. I also think if we combine the news/improvements/general talk section of all three sites into each main section, so instead of 3 news, 3 general talk, etc, we have 1 news, 1 general talk, etc and each section is for all 3 sites then we can get more posts in each section, thus making it more busy than each seperate one. Get me? Anyways, the forum needs to be split into boards and sub-boards like the following:    News ->  Whats new?, Future updates  General ->  General chat, Flameyard (ie spam can, no rulez), Recycle Bin (ie, all moved topics gets put into here temporarily)  3Fusion chat->  Suggestions 'n' Comments, Content(talk about content, ie flash, games etc), Affiliation (sorta like where ppl post to affiliate)  What do yers think? Anyway, I'll email fish now for the forum and the extra webspace in a new account for "bgs" with a password which i will send to you via email. I'll ask for 200MB (which is well enough, considering an avg flash anim is around 1-2MB, thats like 200/10 anims), and I'll pay him a fiver for that and the new forum, if he is a bit unhappy. Unless you areall meanies, everyone pays a measily50p and I'll pay Â£3.50, in the senario. actaully, I'll email him when I get back. Easier. Respond here with your ideas,      Jamie  ,     urlLink Black Ghost Staff
