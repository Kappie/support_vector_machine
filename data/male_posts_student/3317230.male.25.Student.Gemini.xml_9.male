I thought they were all safely tucked on the 60/62/65 express buses?  Hey, could you keep it down a scoche? Some of us are trying to study!  I guess that's what I get in the cafes. So if I can't study, I'll blog.  Last night was interesting, I fell asleep listening to a cantonese-learning CD. You know how when you listen to mono in headphones, it sounds like it's coming from inside your head? It can induce some strange dreams. For some reason the english would command me what to dream about, and then the people would speak cantonese.  It was really creepy. I remember I got really pissed off because I was slowly realizing that everyone I knew could speak perfect cantonese... Amy and Joe (my sister and her husb.) were the first, then Lily and Stella (my young and extremely young nieces). Then everyone else, it was pretty discouraging..  I spoke to auntie (I don't think I'll ever get used to that word "auntie") at dinner last night, she understood the first thing I said, but then i think i must've gotten nervous and messed up the rest, 'cause then she looked pretty confused..  So all I managed to say was "I was up until 5am last night". I think later when I was saying "I want to speak cantonese", i was saying "I want to smoke cantonese"... Probably not the right thing to say to my future inlaw. Damn tones. When you're nervous, it's difficult to  sing  what you want to say.  Um.. the bothersome old ladies are gone now.. study time..
