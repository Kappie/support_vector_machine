Discovered I have 2 rather sizeable dents in my trombone slide. Bugger. Makes it a surprising amount harder to play demi-semiquavers. Oh well. Spent until about 1AM yesterday talking to Susie and Naomi before I got tired and went to bed. Meh.  Tom's gone to Center Parcs and so doesn't know that I'm going to meet the guy from the recording studio to discuss things and such on Tuesday. Oh well. I'm pretty confident about Hollow Altar being good in terms of what we need, what I'm LESS confident about is the printing being cheap. The only thing more expensive printing means really is that the cost of the CD will go up to cover it but A: We don't wanna have to put the price to about Â£10 just to get a tiny profit from each and B: We don't wanna have to make Jude pay lots and lots. I've gotta ring round a few places once I've worked out how many pages the insert's going to be, and made a design for the sleeve. Work.  I wonder if Lennon ever had this problem.  Quote of the day: "Temperature's rising, Fever is high, Can't see no future, Can't see no sky."  From Lennon's   Cold Turkey   Love, Jon Roskilly
