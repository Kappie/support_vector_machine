I am mostly doing this because I am bored and because I'm sort of lonely, with everyone being away at work or what not. Whether I will continue posting in this or not and whether I plan on showing this to anyone in the future hasn't been decided yet.  Today I went to look for a job, like I promised my dad. I really only went to two places - The Brick and Mcdonalds. I'm going to give my application in to Mcdonalds tomorrow. I found out yesterday that Harrison got a job at Earl Bales day camp. If he can get a job, I should be able to as well. But, then again, I said the same thing when Michael Leethwood got a job at Blockbuster. I am motivated to get a job only by my need to get outside the house and not die of boredom. I'm also suppose to get my drivers licsense. Damn. Damn, damn damn. Getting a job occupies my thoughts every second of the day. I feel like if I don't get a job, I'm worthless. Am I being too hard on myself? I don't know. Sometimes I seem so sure of myself in my abilities to handle a job, and other times I very much doubt myself.  I am going through a struggle right now of trying to keep up my self confidence and not becoming obsessed with my insecurities. I feel like every day I become less and less happy with who I am. Maybe it's because I've been spending too much time alone. Maybe it's because I've been watching too much T.V.   Tomorrow is a busy day. At least, I hope so.
