The wild life is dead and gone, There is no way we can go on, And now it seems that I can see There is no way through for me.  How can I tell that you don't love me? The colour in your eyes.  It seems the tables have now turned, There is a lesson to be learned. I played with fire, and now I see That that fire is now dead to me.  I've loved you now for far too long, And only for you do I long, But now I know, and now I see, The feeling's not given to me.  How can I tell that you don't love me? The colour in your eyes.  So tell me that your eyes are lying. Stop my weary heart from dying. Don't quit on me after so long. Can't you see what you are doing is wrong?  You've cut my heart now into shreds. A million thoughts run through my head, The only way that I can see Is to cut my strings off and break free.  How can I tell that you don't love me? How can I tell that you don't love me? How can I tell that you don't love me? The colour in your eyes.  Love, Jon Roskilly
