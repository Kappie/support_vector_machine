I've been doing the garden all day, and we had a barbie. It looks great!    On another side, I'm angry. I've been waiting to get my CBT (compulsary basic training) for my scooter- so that I'm legally allowed on the roads. Waiting since the 23rd of May when I turned 16. But nooo. Nobody ever answers the phone at the CBT place, nobody phones back and I leave message after message, the one time someone did answer they said 'the man is on holiday'. And it's the only place that does CBT's, unless I go to Newcastle. So I'll phone again tomorrow...    Another thing that's got up my nose lately is the americanisation of everything. It's even shoved in your face. People of Britain, I'd like to educate you. The 'A' in 'AOL' stands for American. It is 'American Online', so don't get AOL. No matter how many free trial CD's they post in your door, no matter how many racks of the afore mentioned CD's you see in every shop, every day, no matter how many adverts you see on telly for 'unlimited broadband only Â£19.99 a month'! You are not American. Try fairADSL, wannadoo (I know it's French, but still) and even BT is getting quite cheap. You are BRITISH.     Everywhere you turn: Mc Donalds, KFC, Burger King, WalMart (you know it as ASDA), billboards owned by 'ClearChannel' (they tried to take over all of Britains commercial radio stations, but the government stopped them!) Microsoft, NTL (although UK based), and whats that in the distance? It's one of them racks of AOL CD's! Theres been the odd advert on inbetween the AOL adverts on telly, advertising Pizza Hut's 'ice cream factory'. It shows you a friendly old local businessman, driving about in his ice cream van. With no customers. Then it shows you inside Pizza Hut, with all the kids tucking in to their crap. Finally, you see the ice cream van in the scrappers yard. It's the same as on this programme I seen on BBC4, on about how all the local hundreds of years old coffee shops have closed in Spain because 'Starbucks' moved in. I don't know why, but it sickens me. Don't forget to search for 'Ghost Fleet Hartlepool' in google, and you'll see another reason why I have to see America every day.    Mind you, apart from the stereotypical twats you find in many chat rooms online, the Americans are friendly people. Well, some of them are. Sometimes. Well, really- I couldn't give a toss what they were like, I'd just like to stop the Americanisation of the world (call it globalisation if you must), becuase it does my head right in. Eat at your local restaurant! Buy Vauxhalls instead of fords (aye, Vauxhall is probably the least american owned car manufacturer in Britain!) and please try and get broadband from a British company instead of ntl or AOL. Don't even mention how all the call centres have moved/are moving to india (a little off-subject, I know). Thanks. Sorry for the long post!
