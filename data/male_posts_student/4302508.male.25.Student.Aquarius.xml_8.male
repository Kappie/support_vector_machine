It points out the KFW initials on that after action report the SBVFT claim Kerry wrote up as well as introducing another veteran, Wayne D. Langhofer, who was there that claims there  was  hostile fire on that March 13 incident.   Finally, the debate is getting somewhere.  Which reminds me, I'm sick of the democrats quoting all these star citations about the event. The SBVFT have allready acknowledged they exist and argue that they were written up based on the supposed Kerry written report and therefore are inaccurate. At least the Washington Post challenges this argument which the democrats, if they had any intelligence, should already have done.  One thing about the article that bothers me greatly is that when they are stating the witness accounts diverge stuff, they fail to mention that Kerry's "No Man Left Behind" story where all the other boats fled and only Kerry stayed was complete bullshit. Why does the article not state that these SBVFT have proved Kerry wrong once already. This along with that searing -searing- made up "Christmas In Cambodia" memory makes me wonder what else has Kerry lied or exagerrated about.  Oh, and vote  urlLink libertarian .  edit: ick, I can't link to the washington post.  It simply goes to their subscribe page.  So I changed the link to the  urlLink drudge report .  You can find the link to the story there.  It's the "Both sides have withheld info..." link.
