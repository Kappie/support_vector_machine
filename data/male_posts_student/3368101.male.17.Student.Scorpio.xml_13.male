I hadn't booked my tickets or anything,  so I was hoping there would be tickets for the time we were there.  Luckily, as I got closer to the line, I realised that the line was not actually that long, it seemed long because the  Cinema doors were locked. I had to wait around 10 seconds for the cinema top open, and YES! I got tickets for the showtime I needed :-D  It is an AWESOME film, really really good, better than the first two films I reckon. Can't wait for film four, and book six.  I gotta do more revision tonight, which is shit. I am certain of crap grades this year, so goign to have to work so hard next year, but I can do it.  Also, I hve got..wait for it..A JOB!  Its at Somerfields. I start there in around two weeks, I can't wait!  One final thing, why don't you people who read my blog leave comments? Let me feel my blog is being read, Ive got two comments - and thats it. Shamon people, I want comments!  Laters.  Currently Listening 2: NOTHING!
