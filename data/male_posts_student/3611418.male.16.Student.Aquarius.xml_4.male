To know there is no one more perfect, no one more wise, Because you see the universe when you look in their eyes. No one could possibly take their place, When you know every curve of their fabulous face, Their kiss can give you the greatest high, Like soaring on wings, through the heavens you'll fly. Their gentle caress is softer than silk, Their comforting words like mother's milk. You could lie in their arms for the rest of your life, Safe from your troubles, forgetting your strife Your heart starts to race with each affectionate glance You know love's a gamble but it's worth the chance. Without them your life would cease to matter, Your soul would drain and your heart would shatter. You wish time would stop whenever they're near, So one small second could seem like a year There's something about them you just can't explain, A special hidden trait that just drives you insane You would rather imagine wanting to die, Than to ever think of saying goodbye They showed you a love that you never knew, Deep in your heart you know they'll be true Yet, what's best of all is they make you whole. For you've found the one to complete your soul.
