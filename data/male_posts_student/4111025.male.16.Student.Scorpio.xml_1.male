That refers to the fact that I have no idea what I'm doing on this site. I've only ever read one other person's blog, and was never the most literate person, but something has compelled me to fill out a bunch of forms, and spill my guts.  If you think you know me from the title, you don't. There isn't even an Eighth Street in town; that's just random silliness at the top of the page, and forever in my URL. I'm going to regret that later. But I'm sleep deprived, so I'll have fun with it while I can.  I stayed up all night. Again. And I have a hell of a time getting back to sleeping at night. But, I'm heading up north to see Snowball at her cottage in.... *counts on fingers* four hours, so I figure I'm better off not sleeping, and chancing annoying someone, than sleeping through my ride. Snowball lives in Ottawa, and just needs to get away from things there, so she's coming down here for a couple days. Because of her parents' paranoia, I get to drive for four hours up to Barrie, where she is now, so her parents can make sure I'm not the type to molest or unleash other evils upon her.  Jono's ex, Christine, drove in from out of town, and she's passed out in the other room. She rocks. How many girls do you know that can keep a conversation about porn going for the better part of an hour? (That's entirely unrelated to the awesomeness, but a rarity nonetheless.)  I got her MSN addy, so I think we'll definitely be keeping in touch.  Well, my mind is drifting. I pre-congratulate myself if I ever remember to touch this site again.    Jono: I went to look for a shock collar for Lindsay's dog, so that thing would shut      up. Can you believe they wanted 160 bucks? Me:   I went to look for a shock collar for Lindsay, so that thing would shut up. Can      you believe they wanted 160 bucks? Nik:   I went to look for a shock collar. Can you believe they wanted 160 bucks? Me: Why did you want yours? Nik: For wearing, stupid!
