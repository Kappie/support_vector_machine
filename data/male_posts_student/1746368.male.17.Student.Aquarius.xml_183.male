I am actually getting tired of taking lessons, but I'm not quite sure why. I still like playing the piano. Anyways, we went over and I got my haircut for Senior Pictures tomorrow. Whoopee! When I get them, I will scan one and post it. I went to Starbucks and got a frappuccino and now I'm at home bored.  I had a bit of a problem with the blog for a little while today. It seems that I was stupid and ended an HTML tag wrong. As a result of that, I thought it was a template problem, so I completely restored that and then lost my comments. If you guys want to leave more comments, go for it! You can even scroll down to previos days and check out what is there. I wrote a story a couple of days ago and in a second I will post it. I'm going to put it in a different post so you guys can see the difference between the posts. I'm really bored right now and I want you guys to get online! Sheesh...what's a guy gotta do around here to get some friends to talk to?  I played  urlLink Metroid Prime  for a little while, mostly because I was bored. I beat it a couple of days ago and now I'm trying to beat it 100% on hard mode. I figure if Lenny can do it, I can do it!  Anyways, that's all for now kids, have a good day and eat your vegetables.
