But nevertheless it was only an example and the fact still stands that I don't agree with some religious teachings.  To attempt at another example, Christianity says in the 10 commandments 'thou shalt not kill' (perhaps not worded exactly the same, RE definitely isn't my best subject), obviously this kind of a rule  does  make sense but what about self defense? What if the only way you have to live is to kill someone else? What if you're a person who's lead a good life and it's either you or someone else who's lead a bad life that has to die? I can't think of example where this might happen in real life right now (kinda switched off at the moment) but perhaps something along the lines of a robbery or something? I hope you get my point anyways.
