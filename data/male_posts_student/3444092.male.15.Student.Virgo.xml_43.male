I forgot how much I liked the sport.(last time I played was in October) We played 2 on 2 yesterday, and I was guarding Jordan, who is a senior at Stagg and is already on Varsity. So, a tad bit into the game, he decides I was playing to rough, so he pushes me underwater(which is an automatic foul) then he knees me in my face. I was pissed, so when he had the ball I fouled him,(by pushing him under)then I socked him twice in the face. haha, thats what that bitch deserves.  I saw Secret Window, and Unbreakable the other night. I've seen unbreakable before, and it is a really cool movie, though Samuel Jacksons character, Mr. Glass, creeps the fuck outta me.Haha,my favorite part of the movie is when Mr. Glass is in the comic place, and the clerk sees him back there and shouts "You better not be jacking off to the japanese comics, I swear to God"  Now, Secret Window was a cool movie. Stephen King is my favorite writer, and Johnny Depp is one of my favorite actors(he was the bomb in Edward Scissorhands, fo shizzle) I cant really talk about it without ruining some part, so see it.
