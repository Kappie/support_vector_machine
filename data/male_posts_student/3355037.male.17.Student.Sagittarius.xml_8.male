That was pure ALMOND JOY. It made her TOOTSIE ROLL. He let out a SNICKER as his BUTTERFINGER went up her JUICYFRUIT and cause a MILKYWAY. She screamed OH HENRY as she squeezed his PETER PAUL and ZAGNUTS. MARY JANE said, "You are even better than the THREE MUSKATEERS." Soon she was a bit CHUNKY and nine months later had a BABY RUTH.
