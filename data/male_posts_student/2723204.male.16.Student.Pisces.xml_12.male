(fyi, if the universe was a result of random events, cosmologists has calculated that there would be a 1 in 10^120 (10 to the power 120) chance that the universe came about.)   The Evil Argument:  "Look at the amount of evil polluting our World today, If there is a God out there, I'm sure he would stop all of this..............so, There really is no God........"   (btw, some words I use may be abit too technical, go to www.dictionary.com . If there are any words in which you do not understand.)  Ok, now that we have established what is the Design and Evil argument, I'll start my essay.  	 	Two opposing camps caught in a philosophical deadlock. That is basically the case for Theists and Atheists today. Ideologically on polar opposites, the “champions” of their ideologies, the most formidable weapons used, just like David and Goliath, with an outcome yet to be decided, is the design argument and evil argument respectively.  	 The design argument is by far the strongest, most logical and arguably the simplest argument for the existence of a God. Cosmologically speaking, the very presence of life on this Earth, if it was a result of random reactions and events, as affirmed by certain atheists, it would be near impossible (I never believe in such a thing as total impossibility) to justify the sustenance and existence of life on this very universe and planet throughout the course of history. To bring it closer to out planet, examples such as the nitrogen, water cycle as well as the many eco-systems in our planet today, showcases a near perfect design of our Earth. 	 However, along comes Goliath, the evil argument, that is. Just when David thought he has defeated the Philistines, Goliath crept into his tent and challenged him to a duel. In my opinion, the evil argument, has been the most hotly debated between both camps, due to its almost entirely philosophical nature, without any reference to science whatsoever, as compared to the design argument. Due to the philosophical nature of this argument, it is never difficult to come up with a counter-argument, any counter argument. But the thing is whether that particular counter-argument is logical, coherent and conclusive. Below is a common counter-argument used by theists, used by Christians especially, I’ll refute that………. (I’ll defect for a little while). 	 “God gave us free will, he did not make us into robots who obey every single command he gives us, God does not want the human race to be like that, and thus, with free will, evil would start to creep in. Besides, the same gravity which keeps us on our feet, is gravity which causes people to fall to their deaths……..” 	 What do I think of this particular counter-argument? A Total contradiction to the design argument, in my opinion, say we assume God to be perfect (don’t ask me what if He’s not, its tiring enough to formulate a hypothesis based on this one assumption alone, maybe I’ll come to that some other time……..). Say God has perfect wisdom and intelligence, as shown in the intricate and expert design of our universe and planet. I do not think that God, in all his (generally speaking) omniscience would have any problem designing free will which would not let the problem of evil exist, and neither would he have any problem designing a type of gravity which would keep us glued to this Earth but yet prevent us from falling to our death. Moreover, the design argument has already shown the existence of such a God. 	 Now, what will be my counter-argument then? It can be summarized into “what really is good, what really is evil?” The essence of my counter-argument is that good and evil has to exist hand in hand and good and evil mainly exists hand in hand. This is a counter-argument used mainly by theist philosophers without any specific religious affiliations whatsoever. 	 Firstly, every quantity is relative. Before the nature of its magnitude can be determined (e.g. Long, short, big, small), there has to be a yardstick, a point of reference, in which it has to be measured. Take one week for example, a quantity of time, we can never brand it as a long or short period of time, unless we measure it against something. 1 week for the completion of a building? 1 week for your toenails to grow 1 cm? 1 week for light to travel 5 kilometers? Only when we measure a quantity against a yardstick, can we say “whoa, that’s fast……” or “wah lau eh……..why so slow sia…?”Well, in the context of the evil argument, the yardstick for evil is good, and for good, it is evil. Still unconvinced? Read on…… 	 Imagine you’re in your kitchen and there on your kitchen table sits a bowl of sugar. (btw, this sugar analogy is borrowed from Nietzsche’s good friend, who was also a philosopher when Nietzsche was in his 20s, can’t remember his name though………….). This sugar is only sweet when it touches the tip of your tongue, and sends a signal to your brain saying “sweet”. But take that you’re a person with a sweet tooth. Will you be saying “meh……..lousy sugar……it’s not even sweet!” But take it you’re born a diabetic who has eaten everything bitter, sour, spicy but never sweet, would be saying “wonderful! I’ve not tasted anything so sweet in my entire life!” In this analogy, what is the yardstick in which to measure sweetness? In the sweet tooth’s case, it is his constant exposure and experience with all things sweet. As for the diabetic, his yardstick is the bitterness and sourness he has tasted in this entire life. From here, we can see that the same sugar with supposedly the same sweetness, can be both sweet and bland at the same time. 	 The same goes for the evil argument. 1 act can be either called “good”, “evil” or “meh….nothing special….”. Depending on the yardstick in which it is measured. Take the act of helping up someone who has fell down, it may be a good deed no doubt.  But say, someone who has fell down on the pavement in a park and you helped him up, and compare this to you helping someone up in a time of war, with enemy soldiers hot on your heels………….which one of the following acts has more “good” in it? Indeed, evil is amplified in an atmosphere of good and good is amplified in the atmosphere of evil. 	 In my opinion, there are no absolutes in life, good and evil is simply a matter of perception. What we define as good and evil, we measure it with a yardstick, a yardstick of social norms, our upbringing and/or our religion. There is never such a thing as true objectivity as reflected in sociology and the study of social sciences. We never look at any one issue with our naked eyes. We look at it through the lenses of our society, religion etc. which invariably distorts the image. Good and evil is a point marker in a very big field, this point marker is ever-changing, what is evil today may not be evil 2000 years down the road and vice versa. 	 Which leads to my belief in yin and yang, what constitutes yin and yang of course, is variable. But to put it in the most general definition, yin and yang represents the co-existence of both positivism and negativity, and from this co-existence exists perfection. And you can say that I’m somewhat a dualist, where this argument is concerned. The thing that I have with certain Christian beliefs is that sometimes, it focuses too much on the positive side. Where feelings is concerned, sadness and happiness have to co-exist, excessive sadness makes you suicidal, depressed, but excessive happiness makes you apathetic to people who are sad, and sometimes, cocky. 	 Sadness is perhaps the greatest inspiration for the best music and poetry ever composed. Feelings which we view as negative do have a positive impact on our life if applied the right way and released in the right manner. Many reforms, political, social, religious or otherwise, would not have taken place, if their founders were not angry with the current state of events. Anger, a negative emotion, has been harnessed and channeled to bring about positive changes and reforms to make the society in which we know of today. 	 In conclusion, I admit, my counter-argument is neither conclusive nor was it even meant to conclusive in the first place. But I hope someone can get a fresh perspective from this particular essay, and hopefully this can contribute in some way into a logical and conclusive counter-argument.
