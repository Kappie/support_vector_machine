At that point the news becomes a bargaining chip so that you can find out more gossip about all the people who don’t really matter in your life. Anyways this thought just occurred to me. I was chatting with an old friend and he was interested in the happenings at my university. Now since he did not know any of the characters in my story, I decided to spice up things, define the things that should make them interesting and told him one hell of a story which by the way was true for the most part. Anyways my friend was really pleased and filled me up with some news on someone else I knew, which I shall now spread with great glee to anyone who is willing to listen. Anyways the one important rule of gossip mongering, to quote what I read this morning on a website is “The truth never gets in the way of a good story”. How true!
