    
       Three months of sitting on my ass, sleeping in, eating cereal at all hours of the day, and skateboarding. It's such a rush already, and I've only been free 12 hours.  Something tells me I should plan out my summer, but since all I have to look forward to is Rush's 30th anniversary concert, does anything else really matter?  O_o
