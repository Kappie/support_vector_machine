Reading this, seeing Ari Fleischer continuously blame other countries for their problems and any residual effects of current initiatives of American global domination, and seeing Tom Ridge and George Bush tell me what I need to do to stay safe because the infidels are out to kill freedom and kill me...it makes me realize that I no longer have to take responsibility for anything I do.  Oliver North spent $60,000 of government money on a security system...it was Osama's fault.  But Al Gore didn't catch this, so it is Al Gore's fault that September 11 happened.   And Bill Clinton's fault.   And Warren Christopher's fault.  And Yassar Arafat's fault. but not Benjamin Netanyahu's fault. and not Ronald Reagan's fault. and not George H. Bush's fault.    Seeing how we can delineate blame (if my President tells me to delineate blame, I sure as hell will do it!), I am embarking on a campaign of no loger accepting responsibility for anything.  Every action I consent to achieving is dictated by biology and social training, so it's societys fault.  Or it's God's fault.  Or God's will...God didn't want me to make All-State Band in 1997, so he must be the reason that I pissed on the seat today in the Sociology building.
