Today, I spontaneously bought a box of Tagalongs today...and they were devoured in 10 minutes flat. THE WHOLE BOX.  BZ and I were eating them left and right. This Sunday, I am having a Mardi Gras get together.  Very exciting.  King Cake and all.  Well I must get going.  The function of Mary Yonker is denoted by "Null Set."
