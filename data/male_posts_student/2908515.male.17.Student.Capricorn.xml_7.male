And thats what I've been doing the past few days.  I've been driving to work with the windows down because its been so nice outside.  I love it.  It makes me feel happy.  In other news, nothing is really going on in my life.  Sometimes I think that I have reached a point in my orchestratal career that I don't seem to be progressing anymore.  I practice and practice but it doesn't seem to do anything.  Or maybe I'm not concentrating.  Oh well.  Maybe a bit more practice would help.  It couldn't hurt, right?  This coming Sunday is my first Sunday off.  Well, its because I'll be jobless on Sunday.  But fortunately, unfortunately, I have that orchestra thingy art auction thingy.  I'll be busy.  And I just wanted to relax too.  But I'll have fun playing and thats cool too.  Maybe next weekend I'll be free and able to relax and such.  I dunno, I had this nice thought-provoking post I wanted to post last night after I watched WonderBoys.  That is such a good movie.  But I forgot what I was going to put down.  So whatever.  It's gone to waste.  And so has this space of the Internet.  Yup, a waste of virtual space.
