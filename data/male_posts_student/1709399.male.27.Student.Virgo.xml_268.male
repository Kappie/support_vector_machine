Congress too has some bright faces in Manmohan Singh,P.Chidambaram,Natwar Singh,Pranab Mukherjee not to forget young stalwarts like Jyotiraditya Scindia,Sachin Pilot,Milind Deora.The Biggest concern would be the Left being part of the govt and hindering/slowing down the economic reforms process.The valuable lesson to be learnt at the end of the day is do not ignore the Rural common man.Only if Rural India shines , the Real India will shine.
