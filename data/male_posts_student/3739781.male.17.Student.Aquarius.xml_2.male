It was so much fun I met so many different people, and I heard so many different views about the US and several other things. I met Canadians, and West Virginians and people from everywhere. I learned that Canadians really do say eh, and they don't know how to speak and they read like a little kid. The word ABOUT to them is like ABoat and but that's alright, I also met one named D'arrcy, he was really cool he is living out every little kids fantasy. He is becoming a zoo keeper and he gets to work with zebras.  My excitement now is just bringing me to see a complete nirvana. Its odd how so many things work, and when I'm having the most fun and at my biggest high........I hit a wall. To my lowest low. I'm just now learning how to work with it and it is better but sometimes I just think wow, how can I get through this. Then the next day or in a few hours I'm fine again, but maybe that's just how this whole thing works, I'm putting my whole life on hold to gain a lifetime of experiences. I'm going to come back completely different, and then all my friends will be gone. Not physically, but their mental state. They will have changed as well.  Everything happens for a reason. No need to be worried about it, there is some reason behind it that will take you to good. It may not seem that way for now, but later you will get the answer when you don't expect it, you may not even want the answer at that time, but it will come...Eventually
