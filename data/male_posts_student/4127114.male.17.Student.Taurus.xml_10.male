I'm not bothered, becuase she doesnt realise just how obsessed I am with reading other people's blogs *blush of my patheticity (sp?)*  It started with Zoe's fantastic blog in Autumn, cos I well badly needed an outlet of bitchage about our nasty-but-as-a-whole-nice-drama-teacher, who directed our sixth form play, " The Three Lives Of Lucie Cabrol".  Do you realise just how darn fine it is to hear someone else getting bitter and twisted about The Mace? lol was funny reading.  Then I read Regan's, cos he was in the play to, although less was less Mace-bashing, : ( (Me and Lora, also in the play, hazarded the theory of a sordid lusty affair between Regan and the Mace, after her comment on "well, Zoe, if  my  director wanted me to act in an intimate way with other characters, I think I would agree to it!" because she wanted Regan to grab Zoe's, err, chest! And he looked well turned on at the idea of Mace's chest. Jesus, how I gabble! Anyway, it was only rumination, as the Mace is attached and Regan is normal. lol...  Then I started reading Joel's blog, which is good but infrequent, which was annoying when it was  only  me, I swear to God, reading blogs instead of revising conscientiously for my AS-levels. And to see so many un-updated blogs was mighty distressing, being an indicator of business and work.  When I can be arsed, I read Todd's and Lisa's blogs, which are both soooooo fucking professional! (I'm not so commited cos I don't know them so well) Its like my gard, amazing writing. Their proffessionalness is beaten only by the amazo Smiles. (Jokin, jokin!). And Bonnie's, which is good and damn funny, alhtough it makes me feel really down sometimes cos he sounds unhappy, and my well-hidden - rather unused *guilty face at my frequent heartlessness* - compassionate side sort-of makes me want to cheer him up.  So, after reading Katherine's blog, another fannytastic scroll (just so you realise guys, this shameless although genuine brownnosing is bloomin well gonna earn me links fomr you lot, k? lol) I thought "fuck it, I don't care if Kate thinks I'm too far up my own arse blah blah" and told myself to make a blog for the first 2 weeks of the holidays (whay HOLIDAYS!) and now I've got round to it I'll fill in on a few days history, althought I can't be arsed to backtrack to far, and bore my devoted readers...  So here it is. I don't want to bitch too much, or make people feel uncomfortable, or write anything *too* personal about myslef like you would a diary or owt, but at the same time I'm warning you guys that I don't hold my thoughts and opinions back to save feelings or emotions. That's rather cryptic, oh well, I'm basically saying "I mean what I say", hence the title of the blog, Nice Guys Finish Last. And remember - Smiles's sole aim is to entertain, kiddies!
