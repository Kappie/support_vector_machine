I did take a break to go have dinner with friends. David BBQ'd for Dale, Joe, and I. David did an awesome job cooking ribs. After dinner we socialized and then finally I said, "It's 11, I have a drive ahead of me, and homework to do." We left a bit after that and came home and back to slaving.  Let me tell you, had I been updating my blog like a good boy, you would be sick of reading how how crappy this text book is. I don't mind having questions based on reading, but when the questions don't match up with the text, it's not cool. Anyway, I only have three weeks left and I'm done until September. I can't wait to give this text back. If I didn't have to turn it in, I would do the world a favor and feed it to a shredder.  Saturday night David and I went to a Gilbert and Sullivan production at a theater on the Seattle Center grounds. It was fun and there were a ton of hotties (in the crowd). Only one hottie in the show itself. Go figure....grrrr. They did a great job and the A/C felt awesome! After that we went to Red Robin (the original one by the U-District) and there was a table of 22 with several hotties. :) I'm guessing it might have been a dorm floor get-together or something of the sort.  Anyway, I tried to close my eyes to go to sleep but felt overwhelming guilt of not writing in my Blog. Maybe now my mind is clear and I can get my 3 hours of sleep. Tomorrow I have classes from 7:30 to 2:25. Again, I must remind myself, it could be worse.  Hope this finds you sleeping well (not that you're sleeping while reading this, but sleeping well while I'm writing this...you know what I mean!).  Night night and sweet(wet?)dreams!  Jason
