I really just hope that there is someone out there who is reading. In my next few sentences you'll understand why.  Tomorrow me and 2 of my friends are gonna do this kind of witnessing thing. So I need prayer. See tomorrow is Lost Penny Day and so what we are doing is: I took some pennies and hot-glued some safety pens on them so we can wear them. And I took the scripture Luke 15:8-10 and made some flyers. Now what we're supposed to do is when people ask, "why are you wearing a penny?", give them the flyer. But what is probably going to end up happening is we're just gonna hand them out to people saying "Happy Lost Penny Day".  And Lord willing hopefully we'll just be able to "plant some seeds" in people's lives. So if you would please pray that God will just allow us to minister to people and that we'll have the strength and guts to follow through with it.  Oh yeah and for all you nice people who read this, Thank you so much for taking the time to do so.  GOD ROCKS! HE ROCKS MY FACE OFF!
