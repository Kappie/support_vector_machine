While there, I noticed some normal behavior of two juniors I know, but am not great friends with. (believe me, though, i would like to be better friends with them)  -Enter Party -Stand in stairway -(halfhour passes, still there) -(another half hour passes, still in same spot) -(ten minute game of pool takes place) -Back to stairway to stand -Exit Party  Now seriously, if you go to a party, it is almost expected of you to make some sort of attempt to talk to more than one person. It is really boring to watch people stand under the stairway and not join in regular conversations with everyone else.   It still was the best party I have been to in a long while. Better than a movie party. Movie parties at people's houses have kinda.. lost their appeal, at least to me.  So now I'm thinking about movies. ~~Idea!~~ Anyone want to go see a movie on Friday? I want to go see  The Last Samurai  with Tom Cruise, it looks pretty good. Drop me a line, or something, or better yet I'll just make it a public invitation.. talk to me at school, and I'll get it organized. and um.. ill buy my own popcorn this time :)
