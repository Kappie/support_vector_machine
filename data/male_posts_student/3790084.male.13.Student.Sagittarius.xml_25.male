I came across to this topic which caught my attention this morning when i was in the cab on the way to work. It said that:   Our soulneeds different kinds of love to grow and express itself fully through the mind, heart and body, just as our body needs water, air, food, vitamins and minerals to stay healty.  There are ten  LOVE NEEDS / LOVE VITAMINS  to achieve personal success/ happiness and we need to open our heart to receive each of these  VITAMINS.    TEN LOVE VITAMINS :    Vitamin G1  :- Love and support from  GOD    Vitamin P1  :- Love and support from our  PARENTS    Vitamin F  :- Love and support from  FAMILY, FRIENDS, and having FUN    Vitamin P2  :- Love and support from  PEERS  and others like us with the similar goals   Vitamin S  :- Love and support from  OURSELVES    VitaminR  :- Love and support from  INTIMATE, RELATIONSHIPS, PARTNERSHIPS, ROMANCE    Vitamin D  :- Loving and supporting someone who is  DEPENDENT  on us.   Vitamin C  Giving back to our  COMMUNITIES    Vitamin W  :- Giving back to the  WORLD    Vitamin G2  :- Serving  GOD       I've learned something new today in my life... Showered a person with LOVE, CARE can brings such a great impact in their life...at least they will not feel alone living in this EARTH... keep on giving others supports.. it may not in $$$ but a word or two sometimes already good enough make the person feel appreciated~~  Thanks pals out here who always lend me their ears to my long long grandma stories and for those who always supported me in whatever i m doing.. and not forgetting mom and sis who r the one always being so patient and always showered me love that i need...luv ya all *muaacckkss*
