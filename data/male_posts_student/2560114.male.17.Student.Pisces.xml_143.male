Honestly, i think we have a chance to beat them but we could easily lose against these teams based on a few factors i have came up with...1. We have to be consistant...good teams alwayz seem to b consistant, they constantly keep the lead, the constantly keep on pushing themselves to win, and they constantly win period...2. We have to play smart...i know jon loves to pound the ball all the time and me and david do aswell, but we have to play smart against big teams, we have to know when or when not to tip, we have to find open spots on the court so that we could expose them and screw up the defense, and we have to know who to serve and what certain hitz hitterz like in order to stop them...3. We have to work harder...to tell u the truth, i havent been workin as hard as i should, so do some ppl on the team, they know who they r and they need to get their headz out of the cloud, we r not givin a championship...we earn one, and if we work hard day in and day out, we will come out on top garunteed, coach casey is right, we do need to work harder and we need to keep r headz in the game and win...Last but not least, 4. We have to play together...no one person is above the team, if someone makez a good play we have to b as hyped wit the play as they r, we have to support each other on and off the court, we have to maintain a special bond between us, and we have to put our differences aside. I can tell that someone has beef wit another teammate, they need to stop cryin and whinin about it and jus play the game and have a blast. Life sux, but vball is awesome and our teammates r awesome, so we must play together...those r my components in order to win league and win a cif championship...I know my role in this team and that is to put the ball away when it needz to b and also to pump everyone up and gettin them into the game, i know i get crazy a lot durin games, but its for a reason, i want to win...u dont know how much i hate losing, when we lose a drill in practice, i get omega pissed about it and that pushes me to do better and when we lose during scrimmages i jus get pissed. That 6-18 is omegaly gay, but i want everyone to get into it inorder to win, im tellin u guyz straight up...i luv u guyz, wit out u i wouldnt b the person that i am today, i luv playin wit u guyz and i luv the fact that we r on the same team and we're awesome. We have a chance to make a name for ourselves and bring our school the credibility and exposure it deserves...i dont like the fact that our school doesnt care or support i team and i hate the fact we dont get that much credit in the paperz, so if we win this championship then we might get the credit we truly deserve...aslong as we become consistant, play smarter, work hard, and play together, we will win that ring we all want...thnx for readin this...later dayz.
