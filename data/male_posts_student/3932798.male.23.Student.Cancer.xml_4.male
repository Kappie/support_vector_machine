I wanted to create this blog for one reason, I want to have some place to put my thoughts about things happening in my life.  My good friend and also my girlfriend have blogs as well.  I might eventually link them but for right now this blog is unknown to them.  I really don't want them to read it because I want to remain honest and open to my feelings when I write.  So hopefully I will.  But in the mean time...hello blogging world.
