Extreme Gay Guy Pouncing is great choice, but with Fabi as my goal, Ohh… we’re gonna get called for unsportsmanlike conduct.   Err!  Da boils me potatoes! Tis’ no one’s place to disapprove of me loved one.  It t’was not so pleasant.  Und, ye’ folk need to know what ya’ said wasn’t nice und won’t fair at all.  Riley is a good lad und he is mine.  Und, ya he is “femme,” but I am so.  I heart ‘im, mer dann ‘e knows. So, ya’ll got a problem denn take it up wit’ da good Lord.  ‘Er is mine.  Hearts und stars to he!  Back to dreamin’ uber mine Riley’s fair skin und ‘ers green emerald eyes…    In regards to some disapproving “so-called-friends”-  Words don’t and won’t express how I feel Only kind smiles can help us heal We need to admit whether or not this is real The wounds from them we can not conceal They opened their mouths and said so much And did it of course with much harm “Frickin’ Femme Punk Bitch” and such But, somehow you have disabled my alarm It doesn’t matter anymore We are together, let us even the score They may hate me, but I really don’t care They can never me away from you scare Nevermore they better not try, never dare It isn’t them; it is just you and me Together we in each other’s arms we can be  I is simply a game that we will have to play To push and to keep me away To stop us to keep the feelings at bay But simply not ever, to them declare “Nay” But together we can take a stand Reaching over to take your hand To stay, side by side I know that you know We have nothing to hide   Raping Animals If rape is sexual intercourse without an individual's consent, and if nonhuman animals (like underage humans) are incapable of consenting, then sexual intercourse with a nonhuman animal is rape (or the moral equivalent thereof). Here is an interesting  urlLink news  story in which a Dutch politician reaches that conclusion.  Virginia Is for Lovers Is this confusing or what? "Study Examines STD Rates of Teen Virgins," read the headline of an Associated Press dispatch yesterday. If they're virgins, wouldn't their STD (sexually transmitted disease) rate be zero by definition? Not according to Medical News Today, which headlines its story on the same subject "Virgins Have Same Rate of Sexually Transmitted Diseases as Non-virgins." Again, unless sexually transmitted diseases have been eradicated altogether, how could this be? MSNBC.com provides a little more information in its headline, which reads: "Teen 'Virgins' Face STD Risks, Study Finds." There's also a subheadline: "Less likely to use condoms than non-abstinent youth." Again, why would virgins use condoms at all, unless there were a shortage of balloons? MSNBC's scare quotes offer a clue to what this is all about, and a Reuters headline finally gives it away: "Teens Pledging Sex Abstinence Often Fail-Study." In other words, the defining characteristic of the teens the AP describes as "virgins" is that they've lost their virginity! Who'd've thunk it?
