OH OH OH i went to see harold and kumar go to white castle on sunday night with chris, jake, and sarah(one of chris's friends from DQ) and that movie was HALARIOUS!!! After the movie i was craving two things, 1. get high 2.GO TO WHITE CASTLE mmmm those small burgers looked soooo good, im getting hungry just thinking about them. today i started to mow and the lawn mower fell apart again so i called my dad to tell him about it and he said to go to R and H to get the part, i just got back and i found it but it doesnt fit exactly right but if i put some glue in it, it might. I just wanted to say that today's weather is like really really depressing. its just all cold and cloudy and it remids me of school weather. god damn the school, there making everything depressing. i just cant wait to go t montana tommrow and get with all my family and just have a good time with them and forget about all of the problems im having here and just have fun. i just hope that my dad doesnt put my dog to sleep while we are gone like he did with our cats like 12 or 13 years ago. i just dont think i could think what it would be like w/o buddy around, i mean we've had him for the past 13 years. i guess thats all for today.
