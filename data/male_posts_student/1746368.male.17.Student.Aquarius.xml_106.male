Usually used in an onomatopoeia-like sense(onomatopoeia means a word that is described as something that really isn't a word. Such as the crinkle of the leaf or the woosh of the wind).   The story behind fümp is this:  Pastor Mike, our church's youth pastor, used to know this one guy that worked on the youth staff. This guy was a big guy, 6' 3" and over 300 lbs. He was a really good storyteller. One day, as the man tells the story, he and his buddies were messing around with a hamster. They had this vacuum cleaner and they were going to try and get him to get sucked up the vacuum cleaner. They were getting dangerously close, than all of a sudden fümp, he got sucked up. We spent the rest of the night (this was Sunday night at the youth trip) thinking of things that go fümp and asking Pastor Mike what goes fümp.
