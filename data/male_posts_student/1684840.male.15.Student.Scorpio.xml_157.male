ICT was boring, Physics was boring, French was mortifying (did the lesson in the hall under controlled conditions), Chemistry was boring.  Food was very boring.  Mrs. Humphries said something about being mature whilst doing our surverys (like a fine cheese!  ) lol.  Today was boring, tomorrow better be better... we have exams!
