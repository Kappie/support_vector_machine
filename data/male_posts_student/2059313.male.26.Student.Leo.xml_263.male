It's a great show for a bunch of people to sit around, watch, and laugh at.  The SPIKE network has done an incredible job with their programming geared for men.  And thank you for running three straight hours of it during card night at the apartment!    Cards, friends, junk food, and Japanese people humiliating themselves on TV for who knows what or why, is the best way to spend at least one night a week!
