In that vein, my mother has been running into alot of my old friends lately....I have been blessed without alot of good, true friends wherever I go....anyway my boy Rashard came by the house the other day and spent about an hour talking with my mom....Rashard is a really good guy, I can't recall him ever having a bad word to say about anyone and he just has a really good heart....that's my nigga I'll do anything for him....  Talking to my mom this morning she was telling me she ran into one of my OLDEST friends....when we started really getting into it I realized that I've known this guy longer than I hae known even Nile (3rd grade), Eulus (2nd grade), and Rashard (1st Grade).....I've known Bryan P. since Kindergarten....I just typed it, yet it doesn't even seem real....I've known this guy since I was five....I will be twenty-three in eight days....  This guy Bryan P. is is the smartest guy I know....I say this without flinching or giving it a second thought.....I'm not just talking book smarts either (and he definately was book smart).....this guy had a way with dealing with people at such a young age.....I don't think I have TERRIBLE people skills, but I could brush up.....this guy had a way of dealing with people that was so smooth....and we were KIDS....anyway as we grew older we fell into different crowds.....I was a classic nerd....he was the most popular guy in the class....but we always had a friendship....he always had my back and he saved me from alot of traumatizing incidents....nothing in it for him except, I figure, he valued our friendship, which was predated me wearing glasses and others discovering my smartness....he was always down for me....anyways we went to different high schools and I always made a point of at least keeping word of how he was doing....I don't recall whether he actually finished Mays....I had heard rumors that he was doing the job corp thing....I gotta be real and say that I didn't really think he was going to make it for awhile....so imagine my delight after this morning's conversation with my mom....my mom taught his brother and I'll never forget when she told me about a conversation she had with their mother one day....she told me, "Dexter is the exact same way that Bryan was when he was his age.....and she's  worried "....well I don't think she has as much to worry about anymore....moms tells me that he is married now with a child....he keeps up with another childhood friend and they are all doing the same thing I'm doing....TRYING TO MAKE IT....I try my best not to be judgemental (although being judgemental is a basic human characteristic....so I will be guilty once in a while)....  In other news another of my good friends, Nile (of the San Antonio road trip), is graduating from Morehouse on Sunday....this guy and I have enough stories to write three or four books....we started out at Morehouse together....same dorm, same floor....us being roommates would have never worked because we can't be around each other for that long a time (I   need   the ablility to kick him out....our friendship thrives on it)....his road differed from mine but we both reached the same end point....I'm proud as hell of him!  I'm headed home in the next threee hours....I'm excited....I get to see my dad....I get to see my mom....I get to see my sisters....I get a much needed break from Nashville....I get to kick it in my hometown, the great city of Atlanta....I'll only be home for six days....but something tells me that's all I will need....
