I'm trying to create a list of potential places to study at and what courses might be suitable. So far, my favourite seems to be a BSc in Applied Computer Science at Reading, but I haven't even looked at half the courses available. Reading would be great because it's so near to a load of technology companies including Microsoft =)  I've also managed to raise my first lump of money for my gap year, but it's only a tiny slice of what I need to save. You'd probably fall out of your seat if I told you how much I need! I'm also setting myself up as a computer specialist, selling web design, PC cleanup and advice so that I can earn even more money. If Clan Recruiter goes as well as I'm hoping, then it'll be sooo much easier due to the amount that that will bring in.  Well TV calls and I can't think of much else to write, so that is all for today.
