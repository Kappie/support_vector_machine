Why do some people consider being a call center agent the one of the super non-sense jobs that the Philiippines have, where the people who didn't finish schooling go, and the last resort for the people who finished schooling but unfortunatelly did not got the chance to work to their own field. Sorry if the sentence is too long but I just have to release my sentiments this morning or else I'll be going to a mental facility.  This morning, the moment I opened my eyes, my father told me to stop schooling and work as a call center agent. He told me that I do not study and that I'm usually on the computer. For me, I don't study at home because I don't want to see his face and if I ever study at home, I do it usually at midnight where everybody is sleeping because that's the time where my mind is ready to concentrate. Why should they see if I do really study? So that they will tell my relatives and their friends that I do study hard. Hello?! Do they know the meaning of stress?  Sa bagay, wala naman sa kanilang bokabularyo yung salitang  "STRESS".                 *************************** To: All the youngest child in the family Subject: A BIG RALLY FOR OUR RIGHTS!  The Federeation of Youngest Children in the Family (FYCF) would like to call the attention of all the youngest children all over the universe to join our hands together and fight for our rights. We are being deprived of everything to give way to the elder children (or child if there's just two of you) in the family.  Elder child/children have everything they ever wanted, from the physical need down to the spiritual ones. If they need something to the parents, the parents give it to them right away. But if they need something to our parents, they (parents) tell us to wait, or they give us conditions. What the hell! Our parents and elder sibling/s always bother us when it comes to household jobs ("Do this, do that...). If the elder sibbling need something from us, they don't stop pestering our peaceful life until they get what they really want. They use their power over us. They are the ones why we always get into shame. From serving the guest to introducing ourselves in front of them. Let's unite and stop the abuse of our elder sibblings and our parents to us! Thank you for your time reading.
