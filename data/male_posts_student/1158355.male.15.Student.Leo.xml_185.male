I'm gonna be gone the whole vacation so kiss me now...did I say that? Anyways, it's gonna suck though because I'm gonna miss James' new move into his new house near the Kaiser residence which brings me into the summer conversation. This summer it's gonna be Kaiser, Desimone, Paul, Heaton, Keith, Adam, Rich and I guess some other people, like Steve, Ravin (Kaiser's hood people)...umm...and then there'll be the friends that I'm only friends with. But that's gonna be the group. It's gonna kick so much ass. James house, James' new neighbor who I hear from Paul, she's a great "cocktease". And James, Heaton, and maybe Corey...and me, our band is gonna kick ass too. And the Spooner Street Mafia, I think by the summer time, you'll start to see a rise in our band. Things will start getting wackety. It's going all uphill from here brutha.
