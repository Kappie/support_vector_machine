Okay, I'm not saying real things.  But, hey I'm no social person.  I've heard people bar hopping.  It's just a nutty game of search and destroy.  You search for a bar, then you unleash your thousands of pesoses, then either you get drunk, get laid, gain a drunken enemy, get a drunken friend-turned-enemy, make fun of people while drunk and maybe get killed, burn inside the bar.... the destructions are limitless!!!!  It's an exciting experience.  Hehehehe...  I say "Hehehehe" when I can't think of anything to say.
