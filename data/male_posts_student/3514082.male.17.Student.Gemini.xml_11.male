Although I probably won't be going because it's going to be lots of old people there who I have know idea who they are and I'm not to interseted in local goverment, but cool to be invited, I've also been invited to help out Andrew Duff (local MEP, lib dem of course) in Brussels and Strasburg for a few weeks next summer, and with Norman Lamb (North Norfolk MP, again Lib Dem)to go and help him out in the Houses of Parliament (work experience type thing). I'm really looking forward to both of these :). Any way sorry to bore you with politics crap. I'll get back to my boreing sunday afternoon begging for Gmail invites, tyding my room and listening to Guns 'N' Roses. Have Fun. Alex
