I love paintball, its awsome and adrenaline pumping, but paintball does not have the realism or strategy that airsoft does, and for me, even the adrenaline. Mike Schmiess said it well, "Paintball is more of a sport, while airsoft is more realistic." Some people say airsoft isnt as cool because paintball hurts a lot more. Yes, paintball does, but i dont like airsoft more just because it doesnt hurt as much...   Airsoft is my thing. i have never had even close to the amount of fun playing paintball as i had sunday with airsoft. I just thought i would let that out. I think i will still be getting a new paintball gun eventually, but my primary concern from here on out is definitly airsoft.  Anyway, i saw troy, it was awsome. It was "one of those movies" that you'll be talking about forever, and comparing other movies to. It falls into the "greats" along with Lord of the Rings, The Last Samurai, and Gladitor. Yea, its that good.  I was gonna go to the beach with tyler after school, but its lookin a tad overcast, hopefully it clears up soon. Which reminds me, thats something else i wanna get into, body boarding (aka boogie boarding). Tyler and I decided that were gonna take that up along with our million other hobbies. Man i am going to be doing some real money spending. I need a new canon GL2 camera, a body board, a wet suit, a new paintball gun, some extra airsoft gear... sheesh... getting this camera may take a tad longer than expected.   Will Bordinero - who? oh yeah, him. Will died sometime in 2nd quarter i think. There have been rumors of sightings every once in a while, but only half of his face is seen as anothers is always firmly planted in it also. Will was a good guy... he got swallowed by 'love.' or something like it. i barely remember him enough to write about him... but i know he was cool to the max. maybe one day he will return from the grave, and retake his place in the hall of kings.... i hope.  current arm - right (hurting) current hovercraft - Omar Alvero
