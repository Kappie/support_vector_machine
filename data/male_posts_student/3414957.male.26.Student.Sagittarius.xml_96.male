Every key stroke is listened to. Is he typing e-mail? Chatting? Playing a game????? It none of anybodys business as long as I do my job....and I do!   I am even staying late tonight until 7:00pm instead of 5:00pm because I am that nice. I don't have to, I am not that desparate for hours, but I will try to be nice.
