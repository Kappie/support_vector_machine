My brother walks over to me while i am on the comp...and asks me what my CookBook file is, he knew what it was, because ever fucking prep hears these things and repeats them to sound cool...It is an Anarchy Cookbook.  He then runs to my dad (take into account he is 17) and says "Dad, dad, zak has a anarchist cookbook, zak has an anarchist cookbook."...know that this would set my dad off...which really makes no sense(concitering he HATES George Dubja and the government)...but he starts snapping...but in my family no one is persistant like i...so when they looked away, i simply moved it to another file and Hide it...Idiots i live with, Idiots...
