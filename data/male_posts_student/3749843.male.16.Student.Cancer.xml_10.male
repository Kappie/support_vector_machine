HIB came today. Gave us some gammar woksheet to do. Just a waste of time.     Couldn't concertrate and do the MYE El paper from WDL... Musical notes coming from the area outside the library were getting all my attention.. It has been almost...2 months since i last hear the band play... and i must say that they have indeed improved....    Enough for the day. Time to get my shower.
