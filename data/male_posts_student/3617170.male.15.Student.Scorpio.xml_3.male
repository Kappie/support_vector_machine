"Metallica sucks!."  Must. Resist. Urge. To hurt kid. In face. With hammer.  Now, I'll agree that some bands can, and do, infact, suck. They can suck for various reasons, but they suck. But can millions of Metallica fans be wrong? Doubtful. Most people don't realize there's a difference between a band sucking and you simply not liking their music. Stuff like Metallica is definitely an acquired taste, but once you get the feel for it, it's awesome. Just like Sushi and Wasabi.  Unless, of course, you get the Wasabi in your eye. Then it sucks.   But then, your friend gets it in his eye. Then it's awesome again.
