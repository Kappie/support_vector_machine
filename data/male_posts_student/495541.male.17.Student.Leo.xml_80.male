I haven't been able to find time for that in my schedule.  The least I can do is update my simple blog.  Times like this I don't say much.  I only say what I do and yeah.  Anyways like I said I've been busy.  I've started back up with taking pictures.  I've reorganized my photos on my hard drive.  It makes it much easier to find stuff I think.  Soon I'm going to make galleries on my page and it'll be tight like that.  Anyways, another thing that's happened is that I've gotten a new desk in my downstairs area.  It's pretty nice.  I'll post some pictures of that also, soon.  I've been a BIT more organized with my computer stuff lately.  I've taken more time to organize my files and crap.  I can tell that it really does pay to be organized in life.  I just never take the time to do it.  Maybe I should?  It seems as if my Halbe.org shirts were/are a success.  I'm really happy they turned out good and that so many people like them.  I must say that I'm supprised.  I didn't suspect so many people asking me to buy one.  That's amazing.  Thanks goes out to everyone who bought one!  Basketball starts soon.  I don't know what to think about that.  I'm not really thinking much about it at all.  If I were excited, I know I'd be thinking about it.  I would probably be going to the open gyms too.  I'm kinda too busy I guess.  As soon as that Thanksgiving break gets here, I'm going to be really happy.  I suppose I could be stupid and waste all the time, like I normally do during breaks, or I could use it to get stuff done with my website and stuff.  I know there's lots of things I'd like to do but sometimes I'm just lazy.  I think being organized helps out with this because when I have a list of tasks to do and I see many things undone on that list, I'm going to feel weird about doing other things.  Well, I guess I should be heading to bed now.  I need to get some sleep.
