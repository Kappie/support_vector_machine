So what does this mean?  He is now a master.  Took him 17 years of martial arts, but he is finally a master.  Last night at the test, it was so amazing, I cant even describe in words how much he has dedicated to the full understanding of every movement he makes.  It really was something special.  So a bunch of us went to go celebrate with margaritas, after all, it was Cinco de Mayo.  Good times.  Ok, off to class now.  Fun stuff.  Oh yeah, the birthday list is just what I think I want, not necessarily what is needed.  Cause its all pretty expensive.  I dunno.  Whatever.  Back to the grind.
