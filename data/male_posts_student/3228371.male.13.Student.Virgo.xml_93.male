Argh! So blah~ I don't understand what the "American Problem" but yeah... Whew! >O  Hee hee~ I can't concentrate on studying~ Can't stop thinking of Nima. Yay! He can come to Bethel AND Wonderland on Friday~ ^^ Yayness! I can't wait! I miss him. :( I used to miss him even when he was beside me, but now I don't. Dunno why. But I miss him when he's not there with me or wherever... or when he's not beside me. Hee hee~  Niiimmaaaa~ A nice name! ^^ Gonna get ice-cream or blue slushie when I get to Wonderland! Yay~~~~
