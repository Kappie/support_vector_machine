Very slickly combining hives and white stripes...these guys have a video that im sure is gonna be playing on mtv very soon so look out for them.   Whirlwind Heat- i gurantee you have never and will never hear of these guys from anyone but me... they are very odd, have thier own flare, a personal favorite of mine...  The Dirtbombs- love LOVE these guys, very cool have two of every intersting, but are still pretty smooth and jazzy, kinda up beat too but still rocking  i have a few other bands that you should check out but arent as good and have no chance at stardom.... -The Soledad Brothers (blues...no one here would like them) -Blanche (smooth as silk)  OK, im done.. goodbye until next time...
