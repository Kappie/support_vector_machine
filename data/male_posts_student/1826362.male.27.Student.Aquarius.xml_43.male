He was supposed to call me around 4:30 to let me know what time, probably around 6:30 he said; he wasn't sure what time he would be leaving campus.  he never called me the inconsiderate asshole.  maybe he read my manifesto?  maybe he thought I sounded like a nutcase?  maybe he won the lottery? maybe he found the perfect roomate elsewhere?  I'll never know.  Stupid stupid potential roomate.
