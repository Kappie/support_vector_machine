When he arrived at the girl's house he was quickly whisked into the dining room where they were getting ready to sit down for dinner. He sat down in his chair and the family dog curled up under him. Halfway through dinner the man felt a rumble in his guts.      He was very uncomfortable so he let a little bit out hoping no-one would notice. As soon as he finished his discreet trouser-guffaw, the girl's father yelled at the dog, "Rufus!"       The guy thought, "Hey, this is great!" and let out a little bit more.Once again, the girl's father yelled, "Rufus!" The guy decided to let all the wind out since the father thought it was the dog.       After he let a really long chuffer out of the back door, the girl's father yelled at the dog, "RUFUS!! Get out from under that chair - now! Before that man craps on you!!"
