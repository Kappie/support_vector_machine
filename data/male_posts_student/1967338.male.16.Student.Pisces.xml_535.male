Anyways, I got a new cello, and its a vast improvement over my old crappy cello with a crack in it.  What else, Oh yeah, I'm going to be on Cats eye next year.  For you LC people, its LN's news/announcment show.  I'll probably get stuck with some boring job like lighting though.  Also I played in a magic tournament and did really bad.  You wouldn't believe how anal some people are about the rules.    In a high whiney voice  "No, you can't play that because your second main phase is over and that signifies that all damage on the stack is removed so you'll have to wait until my upkeep to do that, and then it won't do you any good.  Gosh did you like learn to play yesterday or something?" pshht Did you learn to play with a stick up your butt or something?  What a loser, even though I lost that one.  Well, I'm done.  You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies
