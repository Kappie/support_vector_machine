That is the profile of the average computer-virus writer, an anti-virus expert said on Tuesday. "They have a chronic lack of girlfriends, are usually socially inadequate and are drawn compulsively to write self-replicating codes. It's a form of digital graffiti to them..."     gosh. I better get cracking then. I wouldn't want to be left behind. ;)
