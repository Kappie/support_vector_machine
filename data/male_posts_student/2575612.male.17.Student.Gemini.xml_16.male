This star that once burned bright, Is falling hard tonight, My destinations out of sight. Cause this road's so long so long so long...  Everything you want from me, I want to give to you, But everything? I have no clue. Tell me you're still here, Let me know you care.  Anytime...this star burns bright, Dont let it fall tonight, My destinations stay in sight, The road's still long, It's all in this song.  Am i on track? Well cut me no slack, The road's not smooth, I'll keep it on the move, There is no time, Well it's quarter to nine, Nothing seemed right, But i found you tonight...   My friend wrote that song and we put it to music, its awesome. whoever reads this can interpret it how you want it.
