He changed my duty during recces, I headed back to the canteen, and I *think* I heard you are not in the toilet anymore, guess Afifi will remain. Nah, don't tell Afifi anything about it, the sick bastard will imform you guys later anyway. Just act like you don't know anything as you are not suppose to know anything from our meetings, bah, I know I'm telling you, and so?? I don't give a damn. He was like "Liwen, canteen." As for classes, everything remains. I was like 'what the fuck!' I called Hwen and she said "I don't care." and then close her mouth. I walked to her after that, asking her how do I bloody survive?? And then, Mich went shouting at Tt, telling him I've got problems. I walked to Tt and asked him how it is possible to take 4A11 with Kityee only? He bloody answered, 'I know at first is like this, later you'll get used to it.' I seriously got pissed and I sat lazily on my chair, holding my damn pen, writing down my fucking duty. Hwen came and asked me to calm down. And then, Hwen was talking to him but I don't give a damn. Stood there and wait for Hwen and then in canteen, I was so angry and Hwen asked how. I was like 'I don't give a damn, if he thinks I can, can lar.' Hwen said Tt told him we do not need to WALK in the lines. Great, so he mentioned that, so I need not go in though, and stand there like a useless stone and ended up get fucked up from Mr.Mohan. And when teacher ask, I'll just say "Tt said we do not need to go into it." I don't care. It will be a mess. I did told him, I can't. It's like, fine, he don't give a damn, and why must I give one to him?? Hwen asked me to calm down and to lepaskan geram, asked me to wait for Tt in the canteen. I go 'Why must I?? Don't give a damn. Dowan to talk.' And walked to Hemma. Deb was there though, so what? Tell Santhi lar, as if I care. Sack me, I don't care anymore. Go tell Santhi I did couple with John, sack me or whatever, I seriously don't give a damn. Being a normal student is seriously much more fun. Complain lar.. Bluek!! So well, Darren, just to warn you, he hates you alot already. He said we don't have enough guys, and Hwen went, 'Why Darren in 4th, we in last?' and God knows what he said. He said something like, dunno what let Santhi do what shyt lar. Who cares anyway. You take care, dear. But seriously remember, I'll always always be with you. You are on the top of everyone, including John, but excluding my family =P Muaks.
