I actually discovered a friend who fitted into none of the several categories I put forward to you yesterday - Rachel. Although she has the same flaws as the others, just in different ways. I think she knows like Frances and Anna that she is indeed one of the stunningly beautiful people and that could have twisted her imagination, not that she or anyone else would be consciously aware of it if they were in her situation. She just never seems to be up for going out, or ever asks even whether we could meet for a drink or something outside college and work. Well I decided after a long and hard think during till service that it's not worth really trusting anything, Or D.T.A as one famous wrestler would say.  I also got thinking as I often do in my day dreaming there, about what qualities would I like to have perfected by the time I'm as old as the oracle, and well I still need to think about it for a while. Meh, I'll tell all when the football's finished xBuBzx
