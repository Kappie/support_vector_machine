I bought a ps2 network adapter thinking i could hook it up to my ethernet card and use the internet connection from my wireless network(maybe i still can if i use windows xp as a router but that is way way way waaaay too much trouble and im lazy) but noooo.  So noooooow i gotta buy a wireless ethernet bridge so i can play my ps2 games online using my wireless network.....  The wireless bridge is like 80 bucks.....even on ebay.  I could have fuckin bought a wireless network adapter for my ps2 for 70 something by itself and now ima end up paying like 130 cause i always make the wrong decisions about everything.  The worst thing is i knew there was a chance of it not working but i went ahead and bought it anyway.  Oh well, since i always fuck up on everything eventually something great is going to happen to me and everyone will be jealous of me.  Ima fuckin win 1 billion dollars or be the 1st man on mars or somethin, its going to be great.   Tommorow im going to Great America and im finally going to put my WoW! card to use and no you cant come cause you will fuck everything up and bitch about where to eat and how you dont wanna go on any rides and sit to the side making everyone feel sorry for you, i hate when people do shit like that, just dont go.  Ima go and ride every single ride and go on the skyflyer as much as i want.  Im done
