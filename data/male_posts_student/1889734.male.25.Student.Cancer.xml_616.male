Not that I'm investing a great deal of energy on it, but when I heard the news last night, my reaction wasn't clear to me.  On one hand, there's little doubt Jackson is a COMPLETE freak, but that isn't against the law.  Certainly, if he isn't guilty, he has exercised extremely poor judgment by placing himself into constant situations were credible allegations can be made.  On the other hand, it isn't a stretch to imagine that he is quite guilty.  It's easy to assume the truth in the allegations.  But that isn't the proper way to look at things.  He's innocent until proven otherwise, but I struggle to keep that in mind.  I have no schedenfreude over the idea of him going to prison.  He isn't a complete human being, and I can't imagine what prison life, even in a luxury prison, would do to him.  It doesn't give him a pass, of course.  If he's guilty, lock him up.  But he needs to get a fair shake in the legal system.  Like I said, it isn't a crime to be a freak and to display poor judgment.  I hope the process gets to the bottom of things.
