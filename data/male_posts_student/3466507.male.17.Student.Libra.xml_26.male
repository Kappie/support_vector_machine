I listen to almost any kind of music, pop, rock, rap, oldies, instrumental, classical...  As for the kind of music instruments I play, sorry to disappoint you people but I only play three Grade 3 songs, which I memorised. I might learn how to play other iinstruments in the future though, when I start working and can afford to pay for my own music lessons.  What role am I playing in the musical presentation/ graduation presentation? I am currently doing some administrative work. Our guide/teacher says that I am good at harmonies(I never knew that!) but I can't really do those because we(my group) haven't found any suitable partners yet. So I'll just stick to singing in a group and dancing backstage. I'm not a main dancer because I'm too short, according to Sasha. What can I do about it, she picks all the tall girls on purpose.  That's all I've got for now. I'll post some more on music and my life in the next blog, this is getting too long.
