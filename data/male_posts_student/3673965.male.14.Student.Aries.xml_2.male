Tsk tsk tsk. ) Anyhow, time to get a decent post done! Today, I woke up late like usual, except later than usual. So would you call that usual? Erm, yeah. 2:00 PM [ CST ] was my wake up time. I got out of bed by 2:30, and started working. Trying to get with Anime International is going to be harder than I thought, but I'll get to it. I looked at DDR Machines that are on sale on certian sites. Found DDR EXTREME for 5k, nice price for a machine, last time I saw one it was 8k. I also stumbled upon A-Girl, a webcomic ish thing. VERY nice, I like the art style and storyline. ^^" Funny, yes. I've also been practicing on my Japanese, so I'll know more than I should before my fall class, and so I can mabye go to Japan for the holidays. I've drawn a couple pictures and starting on a new art project, " Namida Kanashimi - Teardrop Sorrow ". It'll take me a month or so to get it up, but worth the wait. I'll be changing my drawing style just for this. It'll be a uh, a new one like, a new type of story! I'll be making NK ( Namida Kanashimi )a love story like thing~! For a person who is completely hopeless in the love area, I somehow know how to think up nice stories. Let's see, I'm about to passout so, I might aswell resume my sleep so I don't wake up late again.
