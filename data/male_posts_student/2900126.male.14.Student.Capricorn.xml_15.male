On monday I wasz really sad, mad, depressed, and disappointed in myself because i found out that i failed my Algebra final to see if I was going to go to Algebra 2, yeah i was actually crying, and what made me feel even worse was that most of the seventh grader in our class probably passed the test ( smart lil brats). My grams told me today that my spanish teacher called and told her that I'm going to Spanish 2 (Yaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!). OMG!!!! this is going to be sooo kewl omg. Well, at least I know i passed one of my finals ( seeing how they were both for honors classes). But still like sonya was saying it's probably for the best seeing how some of it i didn't understand clearly and I'll have to take it in high school now. So yeah I actually felt like I was smart because I was actually in a 9th grade math class and it gave me a since of confidence in my school of 8th grade, but truth be told I actually didn't know anybody in my Algebra class except Joe. Yeah I was lonely.   But back to the chicago trip, we went on this boat ride, it was kind of fun i liked the old building and stuff that we saw, other than that it was kind of boring. So yeah, we won ten dollars. We went to this place called " Excalibur", it was nice they had a DJ and everything and everybody was dancing and stuff, besides the fact that the music was mostly rap ( i don't like rap that much, but i can really listen to anything.). Then we went to Buckingham fountain the was cool. Then when we got back to the school I saw my bike and almost lost my freaking mind, while we were gone "havin' a grand ole time" in chicago, somebody stole or as some would say "jacked" my back tire. But the thing about it is they stole a freaking back tire ( i know they might have needed it, but COM'ON). Dude I was so freaking ticked off I was cursing up a storm when i was actually trying to stop cursing.   Anyway we are supposed to be have a pool party tomorrow and I have to walk to school. It should be nice but I don't know. Well people I hope u liked hearing about my misery. I'm gunna go read chichi's blog, since none of my other friends write in there blog anymore except erich and that's very rare. so yeah well g2g.........xoxox
