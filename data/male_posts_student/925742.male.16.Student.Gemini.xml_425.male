We went home, got my mom (who was cleaning out those smelly fridges and such), and went to the Mekong market.  Good stuff there.    I just got done eating what my mom cooked up, it was really really good, like, soup of crab and spicy with noodles and OH GOD it was good.  With the sticks, o'course.    Now I'm reading blogs and stuff  Posting.  AGH my speakers are blowing out, that sucks.  I guess I'm under the misconception that both partners need to make each other happy in relationship.  Its about more than just one emotion.  Its about all and more.  Happiness can come in other forms.  I need to understand that and not feel like a failure.  I guess I am happy. Ok, I'm gonna close this post now.
