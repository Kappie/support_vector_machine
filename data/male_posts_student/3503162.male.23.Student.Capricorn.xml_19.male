Photos will be up at Kenny's site in the near future I think.  Was a fair day with winds picking up later during the game and sun flashing into the eyes of the players. Haven't played in a while but somehow I lasted the 3 hours without too many injuries!  I bagged a few goals, let in twice as many though :P  Lots of sliding, haven't done that in awhile, felt pretty good, diddn't chop anybody down. Sorry don't remember any specifics :(  Go Sweden!
