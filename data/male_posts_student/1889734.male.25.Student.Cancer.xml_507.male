The EU has fined MSFT $613 million dollars for having a 'near monopoly' on the OS market.  Say what you will about MSFT, but this is just a shakedown of a deep pocket American corporation.  "Microsoft was also given 120 days to give programming codes to rivals in the server market, so their products can have "full interoperability" with desktop computers running Windows."  So essentially the EU is saying 'hand over your intellectual property to your competition, so as to be fair'.  Does anyone else see a problem with this?  And of course, the EU wants it both ways.   "CNN correspondent Jim Boulden said the EU wants a worldwide remedy and not a case where Microsoft has two operating systems: one for Europe and another for the rest of the world."  I bet they would.  They want what is available in the US, but they also want to fine MSFT for providing that same product.  Which is it?  If I were Gates, I would pull Windows from the EU.  I would shut down every product sale and terminate all distribution deals.  I wouldn't sell a single CD in the EU, and let them come begging for Windows.   I would ammend all contracts with Dell and Gateway to prevent them from shipping a copy of Windows bundled with an EU-bound PC.    And I'd probably lose a fortune and wreck the company.  But I would get much satsifaction from it at least.
