This disgusting example of "entertainment" makes me want to retch every time i see it. First of all, ya know how oprah has this thing with getting ugly people, putting them on her show, and saying they are beautiful. This pisses me off, simply because THEY ARENT BEAUTIFUL. hey oprah, i have an idea, lets take a 400 pound tub of lard lady and tell the blunt truth. "you're an ugly bitch and its ur own fault that ur dripping over the sides of the chair ur sitting in so go drown in ur own vomit, or eat ur self to death." Im sick and tired of these shows that are aired over and over again....the exact same thing happens every episode, just new faces on the characters. episode 1: im so glad u had ur epiphany bla bla bla bla bla.... UR a true american hero.....episode 2: u r truly beautiful inside, and a hero to everyone of us......episode 3: yada yada yada im giving away all my money to u beautiful people who suffer for others.........ARGH I WANNA KILL MYSELF ALREADY.......the end
