Trial and error with the template has gotten it back over to the left where it belongs.  Seriously, anyone who hates this new look and is going to stop reading because of it, please e-mail me so I can change it and win you back.  Stop reading if I write crap, not if I change the template.  If this isn't working, help me fix it.
