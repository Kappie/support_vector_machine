I've been on 'vacation' (if it's not relaxing, it shouldn't be called a vacation, dammit!) for the last few days, and it looks like my computer time for August is gonna be limited. Why must I be so freakin' busy all of a sudden? Anyway. I It's not surprising that we can't officially do anything with Warhammer 40K, which sucks. but Games Workshop is kinda uptight about their stuff, I think. Reaper Miniatures is a way cool company ( urlLink www.reapermini.com ), and they have a game involving mechs. If we still want to work with a pre-existing game world, you might want to check out CAV and their background. No idea if it's got anything we can play around with, but I do know that they have big stompie vehicles!  But if we're gonna go off on a completely new thing all our own, I'd be totally willing to 'adopt' an alien race. Just give me a few basics (humanoid, reptilian, insectiod, primitive, advanced...etc...) and I'd be happy to mess around with creating some culture, basic language and history. I'll admit right off the bat that I've always leaned more toward the inhuman. So if we want some aliens, I'll be there for makin' aliens.  Just throwing some stuff out there. Also, if we do go our own original way, is there anything at all form making this totally our own...series of books, perhaps? (At the least...a game would be totally awesome, but I'm no programmer).  Hmmm...tried to edit this to fix that address link...hope I didn't double or triple post.
