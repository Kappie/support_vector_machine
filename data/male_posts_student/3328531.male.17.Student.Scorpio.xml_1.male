A problem, a solution, an event, an idea; something to add to the existing pool of knowledge or to at least understand something already in the pool. Today, I found my self thinking about the ghetto and it lead me to wonder why people label themselves as "ghetto" and "easty". I figure that since I am a product of the ghetto and have spent my entire life growing up in the ghetto, I should have some type of say-so in the formulation of the reasoning behind this type of labeling. So let's see:  >> Ghetto is different from easty. Ghetto is a much more universal term, I believe that even a white person can be ghetto!   GHETTO (geh'-to)  adj  a term applicable to any individual that lives a life characterized by: (1)improvisationalism, (2)seemingly free but actually contained thought, (3)ghetto mannerisms and (4)the adaption of ghetto vernacular.   (1) Improvisationalism is the ability to mimic higher things using objects of lesser value or using things not manufactured for such a use. It also signifies one's tendency to try and "put up a front" in order to be mistaken for soemone that they are not.  (2)This would explain people that hold a ghetto mentality about politics and other large scale issues. They believe that they are "beating" the system by not participating in it or that politics is something for white people and was invented simply to hold minorites back. They love their indifference and hold on to the notion that they are excersising free thought when in actuality they are simply playing out the best role they can play in order for the current system to remain unchanged. The system's controllers feel no need to truly convince ghetto people why they should vote or go to college becasue if the "ghettoites" were roused too much they would possibly set out and become too progressive and demand or even force a change in the system.  (3)The cockiness of their gestures, the uniqueness of their walk, their animated facial expressions, etc.  (4)The latent psychological response to being forced to learn standard English. The simple rebellious attiude found in any human being that wishes to debunk the sytem that has tried to put so many stresses on him or her to speak English correctly. Ghetto vernacular is witty and spontaneous, and suffices the need for shorter sentences and a more personal and colorful expression of thought.   As for easty, this word stands for a person that WAS  ghetto but moved too far to the Eastside and was corrupted by everything in the hood. They are the Swapmeet Hoes, the Bustop Bench Weed Smokers, the Every-Color-in-the-Rainbow Weave Heads, and a host of other epitomizing ghetto staples.  Inner City Thought Control is Evil!
