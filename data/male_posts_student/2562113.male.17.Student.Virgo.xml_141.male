Speaking of partying, my birthday is coming up in a couple of weeks.. yes i will be home on march 5.. and i will be hungry.. i am so sick of of the food up here.. the only thing good about chartwells is selling marijuana to the cooks! there is a smutty dinner scheduled for the night, followed by some late night festivities? maybe, maybe not. i am not giving the kids who hang around a church parking lot a place to drink! LOSERS! out of the 30 of you kids you can't go to one of your little houses?  SMUT ONLY !! vaginas. yes. vaginas... but i am bringing home some goodies (karen).. it should be an awesome time! My birthday lands on a Tuesday.. i only have one class that day.. and no class until 230pm the next day!! someone is getting drunk!!  :p  I have a revelation for you.. drugs are bad. drugs make you chemically depressed. you'll sit there and be angry and sad and mad at the world.. it's because you're crashing ( to experience the aftereffects (as dysphoria or depression) of drug intoxication ) . There is a link on this fucking site about how bad drugs are. i quit weed after realizing it does have a crash... don't do drugs. don't even try them. find a hobby,  have sex , masturbate, play cs, get a job, do your homework, find another addiction... coming from personal experiences ... drugs are bad, very very bad! you don't want to end up like purple mustang boy and suck cock for coke!  i don't believe i am doing anything for spring break.. i plan on playing outdoor sports and drinking, but not both at the same time! my semester is over on May 15.. yes it might seem very far from now.. but the days go by so fast up here in albany! SMUT will have a couple  six flags  trips this summer.. i might also go to the prom.. and SMUT will make another beach appearance! that's pretty much about it... oh! I UPDATED THE SMUT SITE!! there's a link on the right..  http://imrickjamesbitch.com  it went away.. did yours?   :-Pd-:  Have a SMUTTY day!!  - R w L super SMUT
