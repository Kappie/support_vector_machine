I don't want to, simple as that.  I have plans for the rest of the week that are far more appealing to me than standing in line for over three hours with a bunch of weeping and overtly historical people reassuring themselves that Reagan was not only the greatest president ever, but somehow we will be able to carry on without him.    I was born in 1980, a little over a month after Ronald Reagan was sworn into office, so I really don't remember that much about him.  I have read several articles about Reagan, and I must say I'm glad I was too young to known or care about what was going on.  Cause I'd be pissed off.  The unconstitutional covert operations, the refusal to even talk about the on going epidemic, and his callousness towards the general population forces me to wonder how could a man like that get into office?  But what I find most amusing is the current myth making the media is partaking in.  Go read  urlLink Reagan's Liberal Legacy  by Joshua Green.  It's funny how a party will sacrifice what ever principle necessary and fall in line behind a man of the hour.  The same thing is happening with the current administration, as no true conservative could support Bush.  Of course the conservatives/republicans do not have a monopoly in regards to that vice either.  After hearing clips of the speeches Reagan gave over the years (I barley remember his Challenger speech) I can understand why people desperately cling to the perception of his greatness.  He was a monumental leader even if where he took us was in the wrong direction.  He was moving, charismatic, and cathedral.  I find none of these qualities in the current President, which I guess is a good thing.  With as much shit as Bush pulls off, imagine if he were fully competent.  Reagan even, well to some degree, excepted responsibility for his administration's actions.  Bush honestly believes that he is on God's mission and can't possible make a mistake.  And to question his command is unamerican and treasonous.     But what I don't get is Christopher Hitchens.  In his  urlLink article , he calls Reagan dumb as a stump, but yet he worships Bush.  I suppose this article was written long before he had his melt down.  Poor Chris, such talent now wasted on the dark side.
