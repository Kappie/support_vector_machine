What can I do to show you That I still just want to know you That this feeling I have for you After all this time's still so true  Feels like nothing can go right Like I've already lost this fight Like my entire life might Forever darken to night  You leave me feeling so cold And I'm not the one to try be bold Though new chapters may yet unfold This story's going the way it was foretold  But just to see the mere sight Of you can make my world feel so bright One glimpse and I'm all tight Just can't get you out of my mind  And yet I've suffered for so long And all my moves have been so wrong I've tried to handle it, to be strong But all I can do is write this song
