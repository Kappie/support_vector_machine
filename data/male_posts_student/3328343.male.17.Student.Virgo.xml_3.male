The Smallworld v3.0 is up and I scored a link from it, thanks GlenX.   There are no flowers, no not this time, There'll be no angels gracing the lines, Just these stark words, I find. I'd show a smile, but i'm too weak, I'd share with you could I only speak, Just how much this, hurts me.  nice piece...  Yea so today was pretty boring for the most part. Spent 3 hours installing a ceiling fan which sucked cause I couldn't get it to work until the 5th time taking it apart and rewiring it. I also got a sprayer and a hearty amount of death juice to begin my campaign against poison oak and its threat to the free world. Then I wound down the night talking international politics with Corie who had some interesting views on communism in Canada, and I never thought blockading Puerto Rico would be so easy. Finished up with reading Glen's new site which I look forward to reading later on in the days ahead and now I'm just rambling on and on and on aandnoand dianodnsdnooandandonassssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
