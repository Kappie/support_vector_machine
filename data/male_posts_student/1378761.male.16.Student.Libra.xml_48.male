So I hope you are happy now eric! Hmm nothing too exciting has happened to me lately!  I had to work tonight and we were very slow so it was very boring.  At work, we now have another "new eric." His name is brandon and the only time he ever talks is when eric is there. and that is because they are being mean to me!  I guess i am going to have to work on trying to get this kid to talk more like i had to with eric. Well maybe not...because now that i know eric really well...and he talks more..now i cant ever get him to shut up!hehe! My weekend was pretty boring..friday night was fun but saturday night one of my friends got caught with all of our alcohol and that really sucked!hehe! but oh well!  Dont really have any plans for the up coming days. just babysitting and working and being tired is about it. Eric makes me stay up until the crack of dawn to talk to him when he knows i have to be up at 7 am every morning!  Lately i have been working on my pool at my dads. trying to get it suitable to swim in. for some reason i cant get the cloudiness to go away and it is ticking me off!  I cant wait to swim in it!  As for this upcoming weekend, my dad wants me and my brother cole to go camping with him and the niemeyer side of the family for father's day weekend.  I dont know if i am going because i really cant stand that side of the family very well and to the fact i have to work all weekend. Still in the deciding process!hehe!  Work sucks! I am getting tired of being on paperwork.  And i havent had a weekend off in I dont know how long!  Not one!  I am about ready to say something to them! Today, i had to babysit again, like always. and then i also had to be to work right away..no break in between so i am like super tired! so in other words, good nite everyone! have a good week! -ash-
