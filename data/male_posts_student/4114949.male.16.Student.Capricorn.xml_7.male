She knows he isn't, but feels some sort of connection... and she's making excuses for him... I'm just so frustrated. He's not right for her, she's way too good for him. She's a beautiful, amazing girl, and he's a dirty druggy. I just can't believe how naive she's being...  She was on the phone to me last night crying about Daniels death... I was so glad that she felt the need to ring me over anyone else, but it was really upsetting hearing her get like that. I'm gutted about Daniel, he had his whole life to live for. :(  Tomorrow I'm going out with Gemma and Paul again... so I'll update you tomorrow.       Jack
