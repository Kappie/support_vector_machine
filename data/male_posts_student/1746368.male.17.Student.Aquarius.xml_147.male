Thank you sponsor. Okay, enough with the silliness, lemme tell you how my day went, for the most part. I got up this morning at 'bout seven in the morn. I didn't really get out of bed until eight on account of how lazy I am. I took my shower and then walked over to the church. (for those of you who don't know, I live like five minutes from my church making it very convienent for an excuse to get some exercise)  When I got there, Dominique, Samantha, My friend Mike (also known as "Myself") and Zach (or Zack; if you ever read this, correct me on that spelling) were all sitting at the table just talking. Dominique had bought me a Vente Strawberry Creme Frapuccino and I drank it all within fifteen minutes. I like those a lot, what can I say? Anyways, the lesson today in Pace Setters was very very good.  It was about  urlLink sanctification . It really hit home with regards to what I have been struggling with and I really enjoyed it. It showed me what sanctification really was (since I didn't actually know) and that I will learn to grow in him even more with this sin out of my life.  I was going to work in Special Needs today but Dominique (more on her later :)) told me that she would replace me so that I could go into church.   Pastor Larry spoke on some profound things that hit me pretty deeply. He talked about the impossible and mentioned a really good verse.  Hebrews 11:6 "And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him."  Maybe I will spend a seperate post on what he said exactly.  Now to Dominique. She is an amazing person. The best girlfriend I have ever had and, I would consider, probably one of the best friends I have ever had. She is always there for me and almost always understands me. I think that you guys would like her and I hope that all of you guys get to meet her one day at our wedding. (okay, just a bit of wishful thinking on my part: Both you all being there [which I am sure at least a few of you will be there] and us getting married [which many people have commented on the fact that that is a large possibility and they think it is very likely]) Many people have asked me how long I have loved her. Now, this is a touchy subject for most Christians in specific and people in general. I love Dominique but I don't love her. She is the greatest friend anybody could ask for, but I don't love her in the romantic sense. I really really like her in that sense though. She is a fantastic person to just be with and if anybody knows her personally, they would probably tend to agree with me. It is really hard not to be happy when being around her and it is hard to not talk either. She includes everybody as best she can and is the nicest girl I have had the pleasure to date.  Now that I am done rambling, please feel free to ramble in a comment...or something...like that...or in your own blog...about me I guess...since I'm such a fun person to talk to...riiiiight???? Okay, just kidding. Have a great day everybody, as T1 says "Blog to ya later"  "We will be perfect in every aspect. You drop a pass, you run a mile. You miss a blocking assignment, you run a mile. You make a fumble, i will take you and break my John Brown's foot up your hindside [wow, someone misheard that one...I had to correct it] and then you will run a mile. Perfection.' --Remember the Titans
