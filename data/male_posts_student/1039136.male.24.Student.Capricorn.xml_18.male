I actually have to go back to the last journal entry to see where I left off..All the way back in APRIL..holy shit!! Well..where to start.. First with the fraternity: We had a sit-in on the quad for four days in the rain and cold to benefit women's resources...great bonding time for the brothers and others who showed up. We won greek week for the fourth year in a row.  We kicked ass during Greek Sing..how's this for a set..."Lose Yourself", "Livin in America", "U cant Touch This", "Proud To Be An American", "Theme From Cheers". Yeah..thats what I thought. I won an award from The IFC(oversees all greek orgs on campus) for Emerging Greek Leader. I was elected Vice President of the fraternity. We did a walk for march of dimes. We still need a house. 99's Ray, Jay, and Tyler all got the grades to get in...it's all depending on the vote now boys...  The last few weeks of the semseter were crazy, as expected.   Myself, Matt Young, and a kid named Jim did a group project on the programming language, Python, and kicked ass with that. I got 2 A's and 2 B's this semester for an overall 3.4something GPA...which is tits.  Myself, Ray and Volch took on a project which we named "MONSTER HOUSE". It involved taking the room next to the bar, and changing it from landfill status to live-able.  Stuff was torn out, Painted, Curtains were hung, TVs with stupid plugs were moved, and the end result was a room for raylo to run his brothel. Other parts of the project included adding a tv and a beer pong table to the bar, as well as a fridge, some sweet lights, a microwave and a road sign that somehow appeared in my bar one night!! ;p  The monster house project ran from May 8th to 12am on May 12th. Coincidentally, The monster house idea was STOLEN by some certain TV NETWORK...as the show airs after Monster Garage. MOTHER FUCKERS...DAMN HIDDEN CAMERAS..DAMN MY LIFE BEING REALITY TV!!!  If you noticed, I edited a post from awhile back.  Yeah, theres good reason for it...maybe its just that my heart isnt in Germany, and wasn't in Taylor either.  Yeah...thats a shoot. Burn any bridges lately?  Some news on the Wrestling front...A good friend of mine is starting a local wrestling promotion..should be interesting to see how this all works out.  I'm going to shut up about it since it's his baby, and not really my beans to spill.  I'm back in the Gym...found a great gym thats only 29 bucks a month, no contracts..This place is awesome...and thanks to that gym, my tits hurt!!!!  Hmm..i wanted to throw out the asshole of the post award to Larry Morris Jr for Never paying me the money he owed me from two years ago memorial day.  Lately, i've been thinking about the future...about life after college..and things of that nature..it's time to do some planning already...Right now i'm looking for a good job for the summer still...I am banking on one job but if that doesnt come through there are a few others I can apply for.  Coming up THIS WEEKEND is markle-fest.  I think I will end up leaving later in the day because kay has work till late afternoon and Volch does too..not too sure if he's coming though...  Speaking of parties...email me or im me and persuade me to have one!  Remind me of how good natty from a keg is...or the wonders of jungle juice. Bring back Frank The Tank.  I saw several movies... XMen 2..Matrix 2 and Bruce Almighty.. XMen 2 kicked ass...the Matrix Sequel was pretty good, and Bruce was OK...could have been better...in an "Anger Management" sort of way.  This summer is brought to you by "Keystone Light"--Whose house is this anyway?  I had several great drunk nights out with Raylo, Volch and Brick...one of which ended with cds being smashed all over my car..yes..SMASHED..and volch eating one of them. The other ended with drunk 80s song signing as usual..and cd frisbee. Perhaps I have some deep hatred for CDs...maybe I should look into getting that fixed.  I've been slaving hours upon hours to get this new web page up! Enjoy it!!!!  I'm feeling good lately..being home did something for me..or maybe it's being away from the stress at school...or maybe it's having my heart right where it belongs, or maybe its 80s music...whatever it may be..I'm feeling great...and anxious for the Fall semester.  With that, I leave you..No promises=No lies..so i'll post when I post..and hopefully it will be sooner than later. Check back frequently.  If you don't have it, you should download Poison's Cover of Rock  Roll All Night off of their Hollyweird CD.  Enjoy your Chicken Dinners -J
