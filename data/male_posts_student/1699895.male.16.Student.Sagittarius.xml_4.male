Our first game is friday 22nd agaisnt Novi at 5:30pm, at our house, come watch us lose!!       This weekend pretty much SUCKED so far. If you havent noticed, the north-eastern united states TOTALLY lost power for like two days. It was so stupid, dark, and quit. There was nothing to do, but just sleep.  All I know was the power was gradually returning to the cities. First the Brighton area got power back on Thursday night around 6:45pm....then it was Canton who got there power back at around 8:15 AM today, Livonia finnaly got power at around 6:30pm...but it sucked because I wasn't able to do anything today, and I wanted to see a movie tonight with kristen! >.       Ben is still white-water rafting untill sunday, so we can't practice untill then. I might, POSSIBLY, VERY slight chance, go with the varsity team and watch them during the Holt scrimmage, which might be cancelled as well due to the dumb power.  I might have to go anyways because people get pissed when I don't come, and I wont be back till 3 and then I have to go to the not-so-fun block party with a bunch of old foggies.  Then Sunday we practice maybe and then its another 3 mile run later and then more half-miles...NOT COOL!       But looking at the bright side, the power is back, and that means the air conditioning is back too, so its not that bad. At least I can sleep tonight. I also started listening to a band my sister like called Apocaliptica.  They are a Metal band from Sweden.  Get this...ALL CHELLOS. it sounds pretty cool actually, and it must take a lot of talent to play like that.        If I don't go to the Holt Scrimmage, I might just see a movie later, most likely by myself...guess you can call me if you want to tag along 7342616603....Well, Im going to go now...l8a all...
