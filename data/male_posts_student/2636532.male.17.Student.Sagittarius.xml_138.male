So here goes........    Greatest albums/artists     Led Zeppelin  - really anything by them cuz they are the kings of rock'n roll, fuck Elvis  Cold: Year of the Spider  - a great album, good groove, varying sound, plus they put limp bizkit to shame as they are also from Jacksonville....Ha! Take that Fred Durst ya stupid piece of shit!  Papa Roach: Infest  - really cool CD with alot of anger in the lyrics, perfect for kids from suburbia who wasn't to vent their anger towards mommy and daddy cuz they won't buy them the new Jetta  Linkin Park: Hybrid Theory/Meteora/Reanimation/Live in Texas  - I don't have to explain this, they are just killer musicians, if you don't agree get that shit out of your ears and throw out your Wave CD you ignorant prick  Eric Clapton  - once again no explanation needed, excellent performer, a straight out classic  Jimmi Hendrix  - see above  Hawksley Workman  - he writes some crazy tunes, I mean C'mon the course is "striptease for me baby!"  Queens of the Stone Age: Songs for the Deaf  - a concept album plain and simple, much like dark side of the moon  Queens of the Stone Age: Restricted  - really cool writing, some awesome guitar work and an all around great album  Matthew Good : Avalanche  - finally he has a means to vent all him political anger and societal fury without bandmates dragging him down, he should have dropped his band a long time ago, not that his music wasn't good when it was the Matthew Good Band but now the music itself is so much better  Prodigy: Fat of the Land  - crazy industrial shit, creating really cool rhythms electronically while still using actual instruments  Cowboy Bebop: Soundtrack(s)  - the greatest collection of techno, rock and funk jazz on the planet coupled with the series/movie, it's fuckin' incredible, if someone says the Japanese don't know their shit, smack'm for me  Finger Eleven  - most likely in the top five of the greatest Canadian bands, i saw these guys last fall and they were awesome, they know how to put on a show and they write some intense tunes too, which is always good  The Tea Party  - one of the world's most unerrated bands, they have more talent for writing and skill with their instruments than 90% of the bands out there, yet their sales outside of Canada have been lackluster, I don't know why, they fuckin rock  Static-X  - if you want to hear some really intense techno metal, this is for you    Greatest Movies /TV Shows     Miami Vice  - two words, Don Johnson, I just can't wait 'til they put the entire series on DVD  Get Shorty  - if you haven't seen it you deserve 85 lashes  The Usual Suspects  - see above fucko  Lord of the Rings Trilogy  - it makes me want to be a sloppy fat New Zealander, it's that good  Cowboy Bebop: Series/Movie  - One of the greatest anime's ever, Shinichiro Watanabe knows his shit  Gundam Wing: Series/Endless Waltz  - this introduced me to anime, cool characters, great story, and you can't beat giant robots completely fucking shit up  The Bourne Identity  - A great adapted version of the Robert Ludlum classic, and it proves without a doubt that Matt Damon is a better actor than Ben Affleck  Indiana Jones Trilogy  - C'mon nothing beats an adventurer that fights Nazis and evil cults in search of riches to contribute to the good of humanity, eat shit and die Lara Croft, you got nothing you little bitch  Star Wars Trilogy  - The Greatest in Sci-Fi, better that Battlestar Gallactica by far, but don't even get me started on episode 1 and 2, George Lucas.....what were you thinking, oh right....$$$$$$$$$$  Nash Bridges  - Five words, Don Johnson and Cheech Marin  Akira  - The West's introduction to anime, a really fucked up movie but nonetheless intense as hell, a must see motion piucture  Super Troopers  - I finally saw it, and it was hilarious, you have to see it.  Heist  - you never know what is exactly is goin in that movie, both versions, it's fuckin amazing,     Greatest Miscellaneous     Communism  - 2nd best political system on the planet  Despotism  - the greatest political system on the planet  Tower of London  - grestest prison on earth, I mean they would throw criminals off the tower onto the square below where everyone could see, now that prevents crime, say a guyhas his hands chopped off,one jammed down his throat and the otherup his cornhole crushes his skull and has cranial fluid leaking everywhere after a 100 foot fall, i think the little kiddy that sees that will never steal anything in his lifetime  War of 1812  - greatest American military/political defeat in history, even better than Vietnam, i mean we pushed'm back and burnt Washington to the ground, stupid fucking yankees  SAS  - best anti-terrorism squad in the world, no one fucks with them   i know there is more stuff that deserves to be on my best of list, but really, i can'thave this thing 20 pages long now can i, but don't worry there will be others, you can be certain of that adios
