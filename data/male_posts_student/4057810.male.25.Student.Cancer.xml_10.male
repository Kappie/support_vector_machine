The plan was to go to  urlLink Spring Roll  and then head over to a showing of  urlLink Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle .  Unfortunately one of the members of this outing's trio had to return home earlier, since the public transit available to her area was scheduled to close early in the evening, and she would be stranded downtown.  We went to Spring Roll, however, where the food is always really good, and I had salmon drenched in some kind of peanut sauce with coconut sticky rice, while sharing some sake with my friends.  It's probably a good thing we skipped the movie, because as soon as I got home, around 7:30 PM or so, I crawled onto my father's acupuncture treatment table and slept like the dead.  I recall having a vivid dream, the kind that you wake up believing you are still it, but it has since faded, and all that remains is the memory of having experienced the dream.    It was nice to spend time with people that I don't usually get to see under normal circumstances.  In one case, because I no longer go to my former wushu club, I don't get to see one friend as often as I would like any longer.  The other person is my co-worker, one of the few that I socialize with at work.  Despite being tired, since two of us had worked 8 hours and the other 5 hours prior to going out, I think it's safe to say we all had a good time.  School is now but a month away.  I look forward to it, but there's a bit of anxiety growing.  My schedule is set up such that fitting in shifts at work will be difficult.  I'll be starting the Korean language in September, something of a crucible for me, since my two previous attempts have been absolutely unsuccessful, in addition to all the emotional baggage I attach to the language.  There's an expectation for me to succeed, not because of any innate talent, but simply because I was born to Korean parents.  Were I able to speak Korean fluently, I would not have had to endure being labelled "white-washed" or "banana".  In some ways, it feels like I'm selling myself out, since I shouldn't care what other people think.  But it's hard not to care.  Earlier this year, someone, having found out that I don't speak Korean, said that I take East Asian Studies only so that I can feel that I can feel I have a right to my heritage.  When people criticize you for not being able to speak your parent's language and as a result condemn you for supposedly moving away from their culture, it's a criticism aimed at your very identity.  It declares that as you are, whatever kind of person you are, you'll never be complete or good enough without being able to speak your parent's language.  Moreover, this kind of thinking suggests that no matter what you try to become, you can never escape the bonds of ethnicity.  It's emotionally exhausting and often painful.  Aside from Korean, my courses include second-year Japanese, which I was very fortunate to get into (thanks!), a Japanese grammar course, Approaches to Modern East Asian History, and a course on Japanese and Korean Religion.
