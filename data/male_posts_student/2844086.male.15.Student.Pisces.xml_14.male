But it was such an awesome expirience.  I got baptised in the Holy Ghost for the first time in my life and it was just amazing. I mean God just became so incredibly close. I'm talking crazy I know to some of you people but I just can't explain it.  God I just lift you up and I praise you for everything. Be the center of my life Lord and just shine through me!
