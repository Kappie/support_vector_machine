Fuck you Little Lord Fauntleroy.  We already have one The Strokes. Maybe you've heard of them?  They're called Kula Shaker) at a basement show.  It was vulgar and annoying, not least because of the oh-so-very LA-ness of the whole thing.  Malbec are from Hollywood, and you can tell.  They sound like a teen soap opera producer's take on Chicago post rock circa 2002.  Plus, the crowd sucked.  Not least because some filthy  hippie who smelled like he had just shit his pants kept shoving an open bottle of vodka direclty under my nose.  It made me wish I were the sort of person who shoves people.  That is not the point of today's post, however.  Today, in the interest of making conversation, I have decided to embark on an expedition into the heart of  urlLink Friendster .  For this expedition,  urlLink your hero  carries no provisions and no equipment but his usually trusty laptop, which for some reason however is currently refusing to delete an inadvertently saved picture of a friend of his  urlLink eating soup in France .  The setup is thus:  I have elected to search through my entire  urlLink gallery  which has not been limited with respect to the gender, age, status, location, or degree of distance of the profiles, and report on what I find there.    Page Three :  I am beginning to become disturbed by how similar people look.  Also suspect that there is a flaw inherent in computer keyboards marketed to Southeast Asia which causes THe shIfT KEy tO rANdomLY eNgaGE anD DISENgaGe.     Page Twenty-Three :  Coincidentally also line five.  This is the twenty-fifth man I have seen with the  urlLink same haircut .    Page Twenty-Nine :  ThElizabeth's  urlLink evil twin .    Page Thirty-One :  At this point the rate of appearance of ironic fake mullet pictures is about one every three pages.  They're all pretty much the same.  You probably have a friend who is using one right now.  Go look at that one, they're all basically the same.  Mullets.    Page Thirty-Eight :  First phony  urlLink celebrity profile .    Page Thirty-Nine :  urlLink The First Ave.   Added.    Page Forty-One :   urlLink Kidding?  I can't fucking tell.    Page Forty-One , Part II:  The Friendster gallery Bloomington, IN has a marked dearth of women over the age of twenty-two who do not listen to country and collect those little pastel ceramic figurines of toddlers praying.  They seem to have all gone to Holland.    Page Forty-Three :  Unfortunately,  urlLink this guy  is kidding.    Page Forty-Four :   urlLink This  is every single girl on Friendster.  Yes, she's you too.  I'm sorry.    Page Forty-Six :  First appearance of surreptitiously uploaded quasi-real  urlLink porn .  Also first appearance of a yawning or coughing girl whose head is coated in an inch of Vaseline.  Bravo, Joanne.    Page Fifty :  The First Ave seems to have accepted my friend request, throwing off the calibration of the pages, as some people are reappearing.  PS:  urlLink Fuck you, hippie .    Page Fifty-Nine :   urlLink Starscream !    Page  Sixty-Five :  Hipster uses  urlLink veneer of fake pathetic loserdom  to conceal actual pathetic loserdom.    Page Sixty-Seven :  A person who seems vaguely  urlLink familiar  at first turns out to be a total stranger but a (possibly former) coworker of a former coworker of mine who is not on Friendster.    Page Seventy-Two :   urlLink Number fifty  of the other generic male hipster look.    Page Ninety-Nine :  Evidently the limit of the Friendster universe is 99 pages.  The last profile I am shown is  urlLink this winner .  I have endured this long trek through the wastelands of Friendster without once running across anybody I actually know.  Today's experience was like visiting other people's highschool reunions:  lots of strangers, lots of superficial information gleaned, lots of snap judgments made.    Ah, snap judgments.  Here in the real world, I have developed a game.  Considering that time is running out on my ill-starred sojourn here in southern Indiana, graveyard of good taste, and with it any chance to form any lasting acquaintanceships, I threw out my scruples against "judging a book by its cover" so to speak.  Now, as I walk or drive around I try to formulate unflattering opinions of people as soon as possible, without repeats.  My record is 20 in one minute.  You might say that this makes me a bad person, but you're wrong.  Selling liquor to degenerate morons for a year made me a bad person.  This is just an expression of my lack of character.  It's not like it really matters anyway.   EPILOGUE :  Returning to the Gallery, I find it's different every time.  Now I can recognize some of the people I ran across last time, and what's worse I can conceptualize their chain of acquantanceship with respect to myself.  I still haven't found anybody I know, though.
