I will never forget what my dad said to me years ago in regards to a statement I made which was "pops I want to do exactly what you do". He said, ‘Jon I am honored that you feel that way, but you will want to made your own decisions and face your own consequences". I know exactly what he meant! For example, I want to be the administrator for a healthcare organization after I graduate. While taking this challenge, I will face many difficult decisions involving almost every aspect of healthcare. I am a person who will go to work every day for the passion and gratitude of doing my best to save, and make lives reach the fullest quality of health that I can. So many organizations nowadays are so dedicated to see that someone who is receiving care makes it out of the hospital by there deadline regardless of the fact if they are ready or not. Bonus, that whole subject titled "freebies and kickback" have consumed healthcare employees to not see the vision of healthcare. Healthcare means protect the patient, not protect the budget. Life is what you make of it, life is good!
