Hormones seem to be flying every which way lately, and you know what, I couldn't be happier! I guess I should tell the story you're dying to hear. I mean, I wouldn't want the National Enquirer beating me to the punch! It happened like this: I've been hanging out some friends of friends. They go to a different school and such so this summer is really the first time I've been around them. But we've just hung out, watched movies, stayed up late, all that bored teenager stuff. Well, I am a guy so I do notice a beautiful girl when I see one, and believe it or not, I started to fall (big time) for this girl Kadey. She's cute, funny, and just an all around great person to be around. I started to really dig her but being the all-time biggest wuss in the world, I didn't say anything. I started giving hints like asking her if she was in "like" with anyone and I made sure I sat by her during movies. I know it's cheesy but I guess I'm not a ladies man. Bummer! Anywho, well, one night we were talking on MSN and she asked me "Do you have some special girl in your life at the moment"? That was it, I had to tell her, I couldn't hide it anymore. "Well, I guess to be honest, I kinda sorta may possibly have a crush on you". It was out, my cover was blown, and now I was up to the mercy of that little beeyatch Cupid. The first thing she said after that was "Wow". Wow. Wow! What could Wow mean!? It could be "Wow, I'm sorry but I just like you as a friend". Or my luck could give me a 360 and it would be "Wow, I like you too". Believe it or not my luck wasn't it's usual crappy self and she said that she was kind of digging me too! WOOHOO! I felt like a kid in a candy store! We ended up walking about it for over an hour and we both had smiles on our faces the whole time. It was so romantical. But now we're starting to act more like a couple. We're holding hands and sitting really close to each other. I even managed to watch A Walk To Remember, because I didn't care what was going on as long as I was next to her. It's been so long since I have felt this way, and I didn't realize how much I liked it. Everyone should have somebody to love. It puts a permanent smile on your face. I'll keep you posted, hopefully only with good news!  Chris
