Zesnar 1:2.8 28mm lens.  Zesnar 1:2.8 135mm zoom lens.  Minolta Auto 132X flash unit.  Three 2-packs of GE flashcubes.  Eight assorted rolls of film.   Of course all of this stuff is really old. The lenses don't fit my Rebel, so I am not quite sure what to do with the lenses. I experimented a bit taking pictures through them with my Coolpix (I have waay too many cameras now) so I might post those on dA.   I'm kind of afraid to use the film, because it is old and might be spoiled, and because I don't have a darkroom and I don't want to pay to develop them.   Anyways I just wanted to share with you this find. I'm pretty excited. I have a bunch of film, a flash unit, and flashcubes that I can use on the Rebel. The other stuff...I might just put on the shelf next to my brownie. Hm.... I should go look for that old camera...maybe post some pics so y'all can see it.   [ urlLink b ]ac0n
