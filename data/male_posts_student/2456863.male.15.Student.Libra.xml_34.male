Referring to Alias in the last part :)  But there is no new Alias tonite :(  Me and bobbie were thinking up a new nickname for her and we came up with bobbie jean (aka scout) for her and B for me, so you all have to call me B now... haha  My cousin goes by B, I guess thats what makes me like it  anyway... bobbie thinks i like mary and mary thinks i like jenni still... they just don't comprehend the idea of not liking anybody  oo another short:  The probability of a secret becoming known is equal to the square of the number of people who know.  Thats enough for now maybe more later
