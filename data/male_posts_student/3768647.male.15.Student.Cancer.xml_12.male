Graphics wise Painkiller is top notch.There are thousnds of textures and for everything People Can Fly(the developers)have taken pains to make as beautiful as possible.From the enemies to the tables and chairs each thing has its own look and feel.Talking about feel,the physics of this game are completely upthere with all the best games ever produced.If you shoot a demon from close wit a sho gun he flies away whereas from far he hardly gets a few shells in him.Another notable feature is the way the Stake gun stabs Demons and pins them to the wall or the ground. Although i havnt finished the games as yet its looking really good.Im right now in the docks which i think is the third last stage.I will continue this section later after i finish the game
