I still don't know what i'm going to do on Monday since I have off.  Chau wants to goto Busch Gardens and i'd kinda like to go...but I want to do something just my girlfriend and I since its my only day with her all weekend.  I guess I'll just leave it up to her (I hope she's reading this ;-) ) Anyways, I just want some time with just her.  But all I have left to do is to goto the dump, and I'm all ready to go; just waiting on my brother to finish up his part of the grass.
