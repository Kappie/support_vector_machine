And I'm starting to think pigs might fly too =P aaww shucks yeah I missed u peeps too :') lol though I might have been a tad slack on you this Sat ^^ but hey you started it!! though silliness only goes so far I suppose...   Yep, the song "Your love changes me" has really nice lyrics-you ppl'll have to show me how it sounds sometime-by u 2 singing it would be nice too coz u 2 have nice voices :):)   Somedays I really feel frustrated by my own inability, often hiding behind a mask, sometimes trying to be someone I'm really not-but God knows our hearts, our reasons, our motives. With God, we are laid bare-one of my favourite songs I learnt from ANCON is Rock of Ages, and one of the verses goes       Nothing in my hand I bring,    Simply to the cross I cling;    Naked, come to Thee for dress;    Helpless, look to Thee for grace;    Foul, I to the fountain fly;    Wash me, Savior, or I die.       At ANCON one point which really hammered home to me is that we, as Christians, have been called to freedom from sin. But so often, we laden down ourselves with our own guilt rather than accepting that God has given us freedom. The bible teaches us that guilty feelingshas no place in Christian life, but instead rather we have constructive sorrow-a love motivated desire to change. Another was thinking about how God loves us so much-that if I was the only person in the world who was a sinner, Jesus would probably still die just for me.It's mind-boggling-never really thought/considered it too much before-that God loves us that much!! And then just comparing it to how much I love God... food for thought...   mmm well I'll go bak to writing up on my own blog about ANCON-soo much to write up or i'll prolly forget them all by the end of next week so yeah :):)
