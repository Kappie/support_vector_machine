The Marlins, who clerked for a Supreme Court justice six years ago, but then turned to drugs and inferior outlines for years until making a surprise comeback and winning the Ames Competition this year, will battle the Yankees for the ultimate prize: an offer from Wachtell.  The Cubs will work at a small firm in Raleigh.  The A's, Twins, Braves, and Cardinals are doing public interest work.  The Mets collect the trash.  The Tigers are floating in a river somewhere.  Red Sox manager Grady Little is Robert Bork: so close to the pinnacle but ultimately falling short.  Marlins manager Jack McKeon is John Paul Stevens: really, really old.  Don Zimmer is George W. Bush: not so bright.  The fan who caught the ball in Wrigley Field that prevented Moises Alou from catching it and getting the Cubs to the World Series is Gray Davis.  Pedro Martinez is Howard Dean: strong for a while, but fading in the home stretch.  Aaron Boone is Wesley Clark: from out of nowhere... and surely to be eclipsed once again as soon as Jason Giambi hits a gazillion home runs in the World Series.  Jeff Weaver is Joe Lieberman: is he still around?  The Fox announcers said that Weaver hadn't even warmed up all series.  Isn't that sad? I feel bad for Jeff Weaver.  Even though he's earning millions of dollars and will probably end up with a World Series ring.
