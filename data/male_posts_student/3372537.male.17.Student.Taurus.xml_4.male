I walked home from work the way i usually do, which is a path next to what is usually a small stream.  HA.  yesterday it was this massive river.  sadly, none of the underpasses were flooded, so i did not get to wade about.  there were rapids though.  pretty cool.  well, yeah, I need to go to work pretty soon here so I will be done now.
