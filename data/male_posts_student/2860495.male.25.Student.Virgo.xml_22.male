Buttermilk toast with strawberry preserves and Yorkshire Gold tea make for a nice afternoon snack.  Plus, I feel nearly classy drinking tea and reading in the corner.  Granted, I'm only killing time whilest waiting to go to work to make the sandwiches, but whatever.  It ends soon.  It'll be different to not do the same job that I've done for the past 4 plus years, but it'll be a very nice change.  By the way, The Roaring Nineties is a great book.  It's great for at least the first fifty pages anyway.  That's as far as I've managed to get.
