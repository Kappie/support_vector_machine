Among the three southern knowledge economy cities, it's only Chennai that's missing a B-school. To change that, renowned Kellogg Professor Bala V. Balachandran is teaming up with influential fellow Tamils in the Chicago region (C.K. Prahalad and IMF economist Raghuram Rajan are two) to start the Great Lakes Institute of Higher Learning in Chennai. Slated to open in April 2004, the B-school looks to provide a cheaper alternative to ISB. "It's my way of giving something back to the state," says Balachandran.
