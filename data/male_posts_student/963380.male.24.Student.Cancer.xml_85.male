It's a network, not a national monument or th eighth wonder of the world (tm). It's a testement to our brilliance as a species, yet it's vulnerabilities also render us incapable of elevating it to the status of Golden Calf(tm). The second this is that at least a small portion of your internet surfing per day should enrich your life in a skills capacity. Whether you're reading a politically biased viewpoint on CNN or chatting with someone in a language not originally your own, stretching your mind is a particularly endearing quality of the medium. So this new link to an interesting flash application has spurred my interest in artwork. I'm a particularly bad freehand artist, as some of the drawings I'm going to post will attest. I think my goal will be to produce at least respectable artwork that I can appreciate. As much as I hold your opinion valuable to me, true believers, I don't give a shit if you like my art or not.  On that topic, They say that release is good for the soul. I know uttering death threats is illegal in my country, I wonder if representing the violent death of a neighbor in two parts ( urlLink Part One  and  urlLink Part Punchline ) is also. If so, I'm glad this is hosted the fuck elsewhere. My neighbor seems to find 6AM an excellent time to go slamming around his household like fucking Hannibal crossing the alps. But oh, did ACME get the better of him this time.  I'm not sure if I mentioned it, but my neighbors on the other side went fucking DOMESTIC the other day, it was supersex(tm). Slamming of doors, arguments clearly enuciated and identifyable by the FBI in Sarasota - without microphones. It thought it was armageddon and I loved every minute of it. At this rate, I'll probably start watching Pro(heh) Wrestling again.
