Usually on my birthday, I try to lay as low as possible.  I try not to let anyone notice that it's January 3rd.  My parents know this now and just kinda acknowledge it.  However, my friends make a big celebration out of it.  Which is okay, but sometimes I would rather not.  I don't know why. *shrugs*  Soon, Matt is going to come over to my house.  Our 2nd meeting, this is going to be interesting.  "we're going to do some hardcore discussing and joke-telling and xanga-reading ;-)" in his exact words.  Which sounds cool.  I am looking forward to the hardcore discussing.  I would like to talk about these issues and get them over with.  Or at least I want to see his reactions when I'm saying the things I say because I have not seen his facial real time reactions before.  Concerning these things.    Matt also invited me to his house.  The date is unsure but I would like to have it on Monday since that would be more likely to happen.  I would really want to go over to his house.  You know what?  I would really want to spend time with him anyway possible.  Even if its doing something I hate.  Because I know I wouldn't hate it so bad.  I was really touched when he invited me.  He started out by saying "My parnets said I should invite someone over..." and I just thought,  Yea, he's going to go on one of his thinking outloud sessions about his life making me feel jealous or bad.   But it made me feel really good when he said that "zenzen0K (10:53:32 PM): i'm assuming you wouldn't want to, considering it'd be driving and also meeting my family" and then,  "zenzen0K (10:55:05 PM): really?  i would have just seen you.  and while that in no way bothers me ;-), you would have to drive 45 minutes" and then "zenzen0K (10:59:06 PM): since you'd be spending some of 4th of july weekend with me"  He makes me feel really good.  I didn't think I could go since that would be a far way driving and my parents are anti-far-ways.  I asked him to come down and pick me up.  Which i thought was asking too much so I don't know if this whole thing will be possible.  I really hope so.  This summer will be the best summer so far.  I am lucky to know Matt.
