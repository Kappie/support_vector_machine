I took a pic with a digital camera, juts wau, soon i'll have it and betcha i'll post it. Had some quizes on school.. but thank God i could do all the exercises and deliver all. Unfortunely i have 15 formules of math to learn in 4 days, is it possible? Nowadays i'm liking going to school, i laugh all the time, i know there are times to concentrate and stuff, but everyfree time me and my friends have we laugh!!!!!   Tonigh is June's party, an anual party of the school and of all Brazil. It's gonna rock!!!! At least, that's the hope so far!!  Hugs for who keeps reading this bulshit!!!!!
