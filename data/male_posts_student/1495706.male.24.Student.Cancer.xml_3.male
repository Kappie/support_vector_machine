Then he asked "did you see that" and we were backing up and I noticed he ran over a squirrel, but the squirrel was ok.  And then it was in the car, and it jumped on me and got blood on my favorite shirt.  And it was clinging to me and I couldn't get it off to put it out of the car.    Then I had to wash my shirt to try and get the blood out, and my dad kept giving me advice how to do it but I told him I'd figure it out.  And I rinsed the shirt  and then washed it and my hands with dial handsoap.   Then at the end of the dream I was waking up in bed in my old room at home cause my cat was rubbing against me.  So I pet it and then got up, and I noticed our other cat was at the edge of my bed.  So I pet that cat and my cat, and then there was a third cat that jumped up and rubbed against the other two.  And I was surprised that the cats all got along because my cat hisses at the older cat.  I think maybe he did in the dream but I'm not sure.  And then it was weird because I was half-asleep, I think, dreaming/thinking of going online to search to see what the dream could've meant.  And there's a site I have bookmarked for that, but it wasn't my computer so I had to search for it.  And Yahoo! searches weren't the same, and I remembered that google wasn't providing Yahoo with searches anymore so I searched through google.com.  Then the site wasn't up anymore, but there were 5 options.  First was shutting it down and just chatting online with really, really close friends.  Then there was discussing one-on-one- analyzing one person's dream.  And there was taking the site down.   What else...Oh.  They could apply for a site of their own.  And then there was something about taking donations to help the site...it was all weird.  And I never remember dreams, when I'm able to sleep, so this is odd.  As an odd thing it must be preserved, hence preservation.
