A small look at these suicidal maniacs can let us see why we deserve what they are trying to get...  Firstly each suicidal maniac is given the choice of life or death for a cause somehow magically greater than any other. Terrorists these days have developed a sense of ego that seems way too big for their turbaned heads, they just cannot find the sense to forgive and forget.   The numbers rising to join this so called holy cause has jumped exponentially, it is amazing to think, people out there are dumb enough to blow themselves up along with some poor little chaps on the side, hoping for a chance to get into a joyful afterlife.  The whole world would almost be forthcoming and giving towards these militant groups had they not become "militant groups", their ideals would be given more consideration and their propositions a definite look into.    The only reason iv ranted and raved on and on about all this crap is simply due to the fact that Asad in belief of his own superiority now calls himself a terrorist =.= Asad if ur reading this, there will only one thing that needs to be said, why on earth would you want to be a Terrorist? that seems like a childish way of trying to annoy me -.-
