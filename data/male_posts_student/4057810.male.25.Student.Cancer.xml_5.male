In fact, I want it so bad I went and set up this Blogger account because I heard that Blogger members are sometimes offered Gmail invites.  I've got a  urlLink dotMac  account that is less than a month away from expiring, and I really don't feel like surrendering another $100 US for email and some remote disk space.  That, and Gmail's 1 GB storage limit makes my knees weak.  Oh baby :P
