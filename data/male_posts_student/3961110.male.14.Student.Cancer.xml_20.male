I will have to cut my movie short, but okay, I've done it in the form of Kill Bill, which means chapters, which means everything is fairly short and compartmented, so it won't be all that difficult for me to finish for next Wednesday, can't promise anything all that long though, its sort of a prelude, I still need to think up a proper storyline for the main thing, :/        final verdict: deadline is no problem for me    Just don't expect uber.swf that's all     Over and out     James,     urlLink Black Ghost Staff
