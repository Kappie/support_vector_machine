You can't smell a word or taste a word. Words are simply the keys. Triggers that cause reactions in your brain. words are not material.  since i am lacking a playmate, tonights agenda: 1. put selected pieces of poetry up for the world to ravage. 2. become a creative genius. 3. deny the existence of the middle class. 4. to be announced.  despise the judgmental. art.  real? perhaps.  civil? of course.
