Well, what can i say. it's gonna be just another holiday for me. not that i wanted this way but i guess it's all fated yah. 3 more weeks before i head back to down under and i have yet resolve this issue. Not that it worries me alot. Just the occasional periods where it hits my nerve and send me spiralling into a emotionally unbalanced state. It's a constant battle of right and wrong. I want to move on. Get over this hurdle that has bugged me down for months. I feel that it's not worth my energy and wild imagination to make my life miserable but I can't do it on my own. Sometimes, the parties involved should take the initiative as well, and should not leave me doing all the work. It doesn't work that way. You can't expect me to get over things when i still see him trying to flirt infront of me. Maybe to him, it's just a friendly fun gesture but not to me, it doesn't help on my situation at all. If you want me to pull myself out of this shite hole (Yes i call it shite hole becoz i dislike it. No one enjoys being in there) sometimes, it requires some efforts from them as well, do their part. Seeing is believing. My eyes still register him trying to be cheeky and stuff; I mean, i dun know how she's reacting to it and that kinda leaves me feeling unsure abt the whole issue. Actually, it's not just abt him but more of them. All their actions in the past had somehow puts me in a sensitive mode. much more conscious of the things they said and do when we are all around. maybe i am just reading too much of everything. i feel my threshold of tolerance is way too high. Sometimes, i push till the point where it really hurts me badly or things becoming worse before i talk things out. this is just so unhealthy. Well...the next few months is gonna be a challenge. Whatever's gonna happen will ultimately change our lives. let's see how the plot writes itself.   It was mentioned by him that 'it doesn't matter who you flirt, or kiss... as long at the end of the day, you are back to your yr partner, that's all it matters.' it does sound logically right but i feel it isn't morally correct and i cannot agree with him totally. i mean, there are lotsa other factors involved, you can't simply put it in such superficial terms. What about emotions and level of commitment to one another?? dun you have to factor in that as well? and sometimes what is considered cheating to some might not be considered cheating to others. The defination of it seems to exist within a wide margin. i feel it is a really tricky issue. No matter what, a line still has to be drawn somewhere. Being open doesn't mean i have to conform to other person's defination of liberal. Having a mentality like this is not exactly in my book.. Relationship doesn't work this way. Whether or not that makes me seems a bad person. i simply do not care. this is my side of the story. I am not expecting support or judgement whatsoever. i am just regurgitating my strings of thoughts from my head and in the process...crystallising them into words so that i can remember what was going in my life at this point in time.   this paragraph has no relations to the above stuff i wrote.... i was reading somewhere and i kinda agree with what this guy wrote. To put it in simple words, If and only IF....someday, when either of a couple has found new interests, i would very much rather they break it off rather than having an affair behind one's back. Personally, i feel that would that by sneaking around and upon being discovered make one feel like, in his words, 'a bigger fool' and it wouldn't be proper way to end the relationship. It is like a disaster waiting for happen and a catastrophe that has undesired consequences. Therefore, a nice clean break before any affairs will ensure a more dignified closure to the relationship.
