So far I've not been very bored, I've always found stuff to do, and being behind a computer is NOT one of them, which explains why I took so long to put up another post. From now on, I'm afraid I'll update with much less frequency. Another reason for this is that I'm on my cousin's computer, and the keyboard is numbmingly horrible to use, and the monitor sucks. I'll start writting about the stuff I've done since my last visit.  On saturday, after I posted, me and my family went to buy the rest of the things I needed. They included some Godiva chocolates my cousin wanted, a power drill my uncle wanted, and 2 air mattresses my aunt wanted. I also got some clothes =). It took a long time to get all of it since it was all in different parts of NJ (low sales tax!). I also got a nice 128 cd case thingy for my collection =) from WalMart, eventhough I hate that company x_x. Stupid Republicans....-_-.....anyways, XD, we also went to Wendys, which I must say is the BEST fast food restaurant in ever. I mean, the food is great and reasonably priced.   Later on Saturday I put all my cds in that case thing, and tried to make an MP3 CD for the plane ride x_x, I gave up since it was too many things to rip in a very small amout of time. I also said "see ya" to hannah =). I went to sleep at like 1 AM x_x.  On Sunday I got up at around 8.5 and took a shower immediately. We left the apt. at around 10:45 and got to JFK at 11ish. I got checked in and then me and my family went to the food area. I ordered a large orange juice and we ate chicken nuggets from McDonalds, little pieces of heaven. At 12:30 I went toward the gate and the retards changed the gate at last minute x_x. I thought I was gonna miss the plane, but they delayed the flight like 1.5 hours x_x. In the meantime, I sat down and started listenin to Namie's complete single discography starting from "Don't wanna cry"=). I boarded the plane when I HAVE NEVER SEEN started. The airplane was soooo crowded and the seats were smallish too. It was a nice flight tho, the movie they played was "Matchstick Men" tho I didn't pay attention. As a meal they gave like 4 pieces of chicken with some potatoes and a brownie with a small glass of Coke. That was the highlight of the flight x_x, it was pretty ordinary. The last song I heard before descent was "mata ashita" =). luv ELT.  When I got off the plane, the first thing I noticed was the humidity, it was REALLY high x_x. I got my bags, very ditzilly, I almost tripped a few people due to their weight and my lazyness induced weakness x_x. After that I saw my aunt and uncle and my little cousin. We got in the car and came home. I had plantains and scrambled eggs for supper, took a shower, and came to bed.  On monday, I woke up early and went to my aunts job, she's a dermatologist, and hung out with my cousin who works there. It was pretty cool. After that me and my aunt went to get info on UNIBE, the school where I'll be going to. It's SOOOOO nice. Anyways, all I need is my transcript, which has been taken care of. That's basically everything interesting that's happened. Til next time!
