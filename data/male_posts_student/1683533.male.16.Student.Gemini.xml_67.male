I thought it was gonna suck today, but it turned out ok.  First, I had a conference with my history teacher and mom for my....less than perfect grades....well....that was boring, but then i had to work at the rummage sale which I thought was really gonna be boring.  Then, Marty showed up!  So, the fun started.  We did little work, and we would mainly take stuff that was sittin around and play with it.  I got a pogo stick!!  dude, and it was only 2 bux...and i am really good....Marty still needs some practice.  Then we got laser tag thingys at the rummage sale, and we ran up to Walgreens to get batteries.  My mom drove us back to his house, and we played laser tag in his yard for a little while, and then I went home.  after that, some bad stuff happened, but i dont feel like typing it, i am tired...i am gonna get something to eat, and then talk to some people...  good day today  "Why must we stay, where we don't belong?" -NOFX
