Women, Fast Cars, Money, Music and my Family and Peepz..........ya.........to put it all simply...........my happiness...........  But today, it's not going to be abt my happiness...........it's more abt wat intrigues me most..........and it's the same thing that intrigues all men - women  im sitting here......watching "America's Next Top Model" as i type this..........and there was this part where a contestant was late to a gym workout.........y? cos she was primping herself...........to go to the GYM~!!!!!!!! duh  anywayz, they used to say in the olden days that women shld be seen and not heard.............well...........i prefer to see and feel...........in more ways than one..........  ok........something else jus happened..........one of the contestants jus fell ill.........she was shivering and crying and had to be sent to the hospital..........sighz..........times like these i realise y men were made in the first place.............to carry women to the hospital cos they cant walk when they are sick...........but the ball swings both ways.........we get lotsa luving in return...........hehehehee...........and to quote a certain movie, "we have to do it........cos we'll die if we dun do it"  back to the topic.............jus the other day i was chatting to a friend...........and she was stressed.........she had a few major deadlines to meet.........and they were drawing near..........and this part i dun understand.........she was stressed not bcos the deadlines were near...........she was stressed bcos she was bumming around and not doing her work........huh?!?!??!?! how hard can it be to jus pick yourself up, do the work and get it over and done with?!?  and the other day, i was playing snooker wif some frens.........and a fren asked me wat time it was..........neither of us had a watch.........and all our handphones were on a tray jus 2 metres away from my fren..........so i asked her to check out the handphones.........and guess wat...........she didnt want too...........y? cos she was too lazy...........huh?!?!? and then i had to get the phone for her to check the time........sighz.............  women...........hate to love them, but we cant help it. love to hate them? which man can do that? maybe the gays..........speaking of which.........sometimes i really envy the gays.........cos they get access to the best women........EASILY..........  i jus saw a gay stylist adjust a HUGE diamond in "The Land of The Twin Peaks"..........if i were him i would be scaling the peaks..........more than once...........but then if i were him, i would be gay...........and i wouldnt have such interests............but then again...........them peaks were high enuf to turn any man, gay or not gay, into a mountain climbing addict...........
