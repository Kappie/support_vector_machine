We are still at Grand Bahama Island, now on our second marina, Port Lucaya Beach Resort  Marina to be exact.  Pretty nice place, bigger and better than our first marina here, Xanadu, which sounded like it would be cool.  It had a nice beach though, but not where I'ld want to stay if I came to the Bahamas.  I did also get a chance to catch a couple of episodes of Dawson's Creek in their workout room.  Pacey just kissed Joey.  After the night at Xanadu we spent the day out on the water sailing, fishing and snorkeling.  The sailing was good for a change.  Caught one fish that we kept and plan to eat, see pics below.  The snorkeling was good, a nice reef, but unbeknownst to me I dropped my diving knife, which I guess really isnt a diving knife since it rusts, on the way back into the boat.  Then after realizing this a couple hours later we went back to where we thought it was and I actually found it on the bottom. I paid 20 bucks for that thing.  After our fun, we decided we had to go to a marina again for the night because there was nowhere safe to anchor within reach.  So that how we are where we are now.  Theres a bunch of nice shops and a casino here.  We had dinner on the patio at Dominoes and the strangest thing happened.  This song came on over the loudspeakers, that knew cha-cha dance song, and everybody just dropped what they were doing and started dancing out in the walkways between the shops... Everybody!.  Weird, but most were drunken teenage girls getting off a booze cruise though.  We hit the casino, played some video poker, blackjack and carribean stud and I actually walked away with about 200 bucks... amazing.  Alex made 5 bucks.  Now its morning, we're gonna go stock up on groceries and water and figure out where the hell we are gonna go from here.  There is nothing good and close and cheap... We'ld like to get down to the Exumas and hold out the rest of the summer on a deserted Island.. but thats another 200 miles away and we only make about 30-50 a day.  SO it looks like we might have to do another couple all nighters, or we might just except defeat and come home... I hope not though...    urlLink The Blue Sky parked at Xanadu Beach Resort  Marina   urlLink The Beach at Xanadu   urlLink Blue Sky dwarfing the other boats at Port Lucaya   urlLink The shark sucker we caught   urlLink The Little Fish we caught and plan to eat (1 of 2)   urlLink Lil' Fish 2
