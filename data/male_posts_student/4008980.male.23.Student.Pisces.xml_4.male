Any help?  It was part of some lyrics I wrote when I was going through a very neo-political phase about a year and a half ago after the whole Iraq thing boiled over. I get kind of edgy when I see some of the stuff that I wrote because:   a) (self-politely) It needs work;   b)It makes me realize how much I truly hated what Bush was doing to our country. I'm no fan of Bush still, and if he wins again I might move to Canada, but if little me is any indication of the large political divide, then the divide is a chasm.   More to come on this topic later in the evening.
