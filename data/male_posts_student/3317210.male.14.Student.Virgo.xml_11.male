It ended up being black pants, shirt, with a silver tie and vest. (silver was highly reflective, I'm sure I was aiming to blind a few people when the spotlights hit me)  On Thursday morning, I woke up, got prepared awfully slow and then was driven to our Musical Showcase venue. I arrived at the venue (late) and had to whip my instrument out extremely quickly as everyone was about to start.  Fantastic rehearsal for jazz, my only two issues was I had to play up, and play, in Justin's words, "LOUDER!" One of the guitarists got a wibble-wa peddle (very weird =P ) and ended up using it for his solo improv. Around 9:30 we packed up, left for school at 10 after when the bus arrived. When I got back to school, I didn't go to class, I went to something called Musica Viva (not sure on spelling), and listened to that. Great jazz artists, the one who played trumpet/trombone was a hippy with eyebrows that looked a bit like Guy Sebastian's hair, another was an old man who always played the cello with eyes closed, the percussionist was generally cool, very quiet though, and the final guy had a trim haircut and wore glasses, he played sax. Anyway, got out of there, had recess, got back to my first and only class of the day, and that was... Music! =P Unfortunately, we got a replacement teacher and just sat around doing sheets, but then just before 12:30 we left for the next bus. Luke and I caught this one, and we listened to his Christian rock on the way down... Good to know Christians know how to write songs! =P When we arrived there Intermediate Band was on first, so I went and watched Luke play. He was extremely bored, as the majority of his notes were single handed and crotchets. We're actually thinking of making me play it, as I need to learn piano, and, well, reality's the best way to learn =) Next was flute ensemble *insert sleeping sound here* They weren't actually that bad, but my ex-girlfriend is one of them, so of course I've got to pretend to be bored lol And then, we were on... WOOT! Senior Concert Band, conducted by the awesome Hutch (don't worry, it's a nick name for our teacher =P ). The band performed fabulously, apart from the small situation involving the oboe-ist and the Pizza guy (his sister was supposed to pay for the Pizza, but, well =P ) Anyway, I was supposed to go back to school then, but the bus was filled with Junior school kids (shove them in the baggage compartments!), so we had to wait until the bus came back... That was a very long time, excessive to the extreme. I ended missing out on all of last period. After that, I went to the bus stop to *sigh* 'hang out' *sigh*, and everyone's bus turned up in the first 5 minutes (Thursday remember, shopping spree night lol) and after saying bye to Elyse (Elyce, Elise, spelling *sigh*) and to Josh, and giving her a chip packet, I went in the library. God knows what I did in there, something to do with raytracing and trying to find out how to calculate translucency utilising a similar technique to ambient occlusion I think... Anyway, finally got picked up. When we got there I went to Orchestra rehearsal. Boring. Orchestra isn't the greatest unfortuntely, we played Mission Impossible  again  for like the 2nd year in a row, and a song called Finlandia from the Babe movie. Wow, some way to start a show.  Start of the performance we played the two Orchestra songs, it was alright, nothing fantastic though. Then I had to wait until past second intermission, when we play Senior Concert Band and Jazz... So, I went up looking for Luke (he said we'd wait around together), couldn't find him, so I hung out with Anistasia, a friendly girl in Year 10 I think, plays the clarinet. Then, she found her friends, I saw Sophie and Jenny and I hung out with them for a while.  After 15 minutes, it was interval, I got prepared for Senior Concert. It was an absolute BLAST! Only problem was 9/10ths of the crowd went home because they were in Junior School... Oh, hurray... They should lock the doors lol The song we played was Pablo, fast, sharp, and absolutely a lot of fun to play, the kind of song that gives you an adrenaline rush. Went back, I changed (with lots of difficulty) to the suit I'd gotten on Wednesday, and was teased by probably every single student, and even by Hutch, our conductor/teacher/generally cool guy, he did the whole mother thing where he got my tie and straightened it and fixed it up *sigh* lol Justin ended up wearing "shades", and so did the drummer (he also wore suede, cool huh?)  THEN! Jazz! Started off with "This Ain't Love", a 1930s style swing song, usually used for dancing back then. We began playing into our stands, quiet, muffled, then blew EVERYONE away! =) Fantabulous, absolutely excellent, always fun. Then we played "Blue Bossa", which is once again another great piece, and I can almost play all of it lol This song was Justin's solo chance, lots of fun. After this, we were supposed to leave and go home, but the guys had planned to break into "Chameleon" after, unfortunately the crappy music to fill the gaps started, and we had to wait for them to switch it off. Once that happened, we waited around for about 10-15 bars playing it, then packed up and went home. And I was told on the next day Hutch made kissy faces to Luke and Lauren (my friend, who's going out with Lauren *der* as they were sitting next to each other). Luke at the moment is attempting to avoid Hutch, with little success! =P lol  Friday - *phew* No-one really congratulated me, but that's alright, no-one usually does lol I ended up cutting my inner lip or causing some kind of unfathomable pain in my mouth Generally went back to school *sigh*  But the main pick up that night, was, I went to the  Lord of the Rings Symphony  at the Opera House! We got there early, I 'dined' on two hot dogs and some plain rice, and strolled around admiring how big the Opera House was. Even though I'm an Australian, the last (and only other than now) time I went there, I was four and all I really remember of it was sitting outside, very bored and cold, waiting for intermission so we could get back in...  Anyway, it began in an excellent manner, with Howard Shore being a... quite interesting? conductor... He actually conducted on off-beats I think, or something strange like that. I have four pages of notes beginning at the end of intermission. It was an excellent performance, get the soundtrack! =P Also, I discovered that there is a crushed car at the Opera House, crushed by a rock with a smilie face... Quite peculiar...  Anyway, it's 11:04 on Sunday now (I kind of got to finish this last night) and I'm going to sum up Oh yeah, yesterday I got an electronic compass for my Robot *woot*  Bai Bai
