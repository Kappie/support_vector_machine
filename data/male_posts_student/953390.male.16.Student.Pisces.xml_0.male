I went to see my doctor about it because I had no idea what these big-ass 'bug-bites' were, but they were freakin' huge! Looked like plateaus on my arms and knees. So, he said that they were hives, but not because of allergies (I was about to say... I had a test and I have no allergies, but I swear I have one to grits!). It was due to 'an indirect reaction to a virus.' Tyler, my little brother, had a tummy bug, so instead of getting sick, my body is fighting it and getting these stupid, itching-like-buggers, plateaus. So, for next 4-5 days, I have to wear loose clothing, pop Benadryl like a crack fiend, and hang around 'till they disappear. Yay for me! :-/ I gave someone my web address and they asked me if it were some gay porn website. That about killed me from laughter. :-D
