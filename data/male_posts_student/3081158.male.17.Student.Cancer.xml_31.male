The soldiers, on patrol near the city of Samarra 60 miles north of Baghdad on Jan. 3, pushed two Iraqis off a bridge at nighttime into the Tigris River after picking up the men on a curfew violation, officials said. One Iraqi drowned, while the other got out of the river.    This is truly scary shit. I don't understand why our troops are so hostile to the civilians over there. It usually means extremely low morale, which would make sense because of all the factors like car bombings, the  urlLink involuntary call to service , being lied to about the motives for being sent to war, etc.  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Interesting news at  urlLink Reuters : The pace of job growth has "slowed sharply in June" as less than half of the predicted number of jobs were created. In fact, the "manufacturing sector lost 11,000 jobs." Many predict a "leveling off in the pace of the economy" while the boom in number of jobs is a sign of lower corporate profits. Some say there are good signs of the economy getting better, but this might just be the aristocracy talking. One should remember that the actual quality of the job market has declined significantly with the boom in jobs. It was noticed that "that wages are not keeping up with the costs that people are facing" and the increase of jobs has actually caused the average workweek to get shorter, back to where it was in December. It's uncertain if the decline in growth will continue, but the changes seen so far have fallen short of greatness.   Also, for the first time in 4 years, "the U.S. central bank raised official interest rates a quarter percentage point on Wednesday."   GM is reported to have "double-digit declines in their U.S. sales during June, a drag on the economy not only because automakers are big employers but also major users of materials for manufacturing." The rise in energy prices is probably the most significant factor, especially considering the hike in gas prices recently.
