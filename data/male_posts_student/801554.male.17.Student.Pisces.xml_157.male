I'm running for president of the student council against the guy who's been president of our class for three years. He's a good public speaker. He's a great public speaker.   I tend to mumble and have never run for class office before.  I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING.  I just don't think he should be unoposed. I don't like him very much.  I read a fortune cookie once that said "Many a wrong step is made by standing still". Perhaps this is a wrong step, but it's a step. A leap really.  Elections are next Thursday.
