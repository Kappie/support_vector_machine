They had grown less feminine, somehow harder to reach, easier to miss; wonderfully paradoxical in their new found power.  Revolutionary pockets of resistance sprung up amongst the famous O.G.R.E movement, whose members feared an androgynous coup was about to take place. The Old Geezers Rejecting Erasure had to concoct a cunning plan to re-establish stability into society. After all, maybe their ploy smacked of simplicity rather than fox like cunning. It introduced fear back into the lives of ‘independent women’.  It was 3a.m in a quiet suburb of London. West Hampstead had been sleeping peacefully for some time, but unrest was brewing at an address in Mill road. The vilest of all living creatures had camped itself on the kitchen floor, waiting to fright, sending the unwary entrée into flight. Its telescopic legs, forming into glasses before those horrendous red eyes, that glistening under-belly enveloped in slime; it truly was a knee shaking sight, a dark form in the dark of night.  Ceci, troubled in her restless sleep, could no longer flit from dream there and in between. She slipped on her ironed power bath-robe that spoke of high class city living and stumbled downstairs in her slumber. Not for a second, to anticipate what was about to confront her in her own kitchen (not to be confused with chicken).  The power drained from her, she developed ‘wet legs’, her posture slumped, and the fear seized her eyes. Powerless in her own chicken, without corner to hide, or hutch to run into. With her bottom lip quivering, and the top one pretending to be stiff, she mustered a feeble scream that made the bug expand two-fold, appearing ever more menacing. Paralyzed with fear she continued to wheeze her lonely cry for help, and out of the shadows came Christina dressed in her cat-suit. Ready to scratch Ceci out of trouble, and into a realm of safety.  The united front of the sister act began to crumble when they realised the laser beams zooming in on them. The piercing rays mechanically zoning themselves in on the whimpering targets. An executive decision had to be reached quickly. ‘Run, Run, Run; Run for the end is nigh.’ The girls bolted back upstairs, swiftly as a nandrolone fuelled gazelle, leaving behind the monstrous beast, to cower behind a locked door for the rest of the night.  Ben, a third house-mate, having slept through the terrors of the night, awoke refreshed and full of bounce. After pulling the remains of a mango fruit from between his teeth; which he had devoured for breakfast, downing a Tequila suicide to remove the sleep from his eyes, and playing a few Chas numbers in D-minor on a mandolin given to him by a Mexican refugee, he strode into the kitchen, picked up his car keys and drove to work.  A short story based on real events.
