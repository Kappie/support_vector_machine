"Due to the lack of blogging by the other members in the blog community in which I belong to, I have no other course of action," Brown commented. He also talked about the fact that  Three Eye Witnesses  has been suffering for some time now, "We've been hurting for quite some time. It's like we are wasting time on a worthless project."  With no solid timeline for a strike to occur, Brown remained hopeful that the blogging problem would be recitified soon. "I am confident that the blogging status of 'dormant' on  TEW  will soon be raised to 'active' within the new 48 hours."  Mr. Brown has been a writer for  Three Eye Witnesses  since May of 2003 while maintaining his personal blog,  Go Ahead and Read This Only if You Dare . He has been focusing lately on his own blog due to the fact that his joint effort with writer  J.R. Ganzon  has been slowed down quite a bit. "I have been updating my own blog daily, while neglecting the blog that  J.R.  and I have together. There haven't been any 'good' topics to talk about on  Three Eye Witnesses  and that is causing a major problem. Like I keep reiterating, I don't want the blog to just fade into the background, I would like it to stay!"  No timeline was set for either the strike or  Brown's  resignation, yet, he hints that it could very well be soon, "With my upcoming vacation, things could happen faster or slower than you really think. Just check the website for updates every day until noon, Friday."  --------------------- On the 'Web   Three Eye Witnesses:  http://screwlife.blogspot.com   Go Ahead and Read This Only if You Dare: : http://home.earthlink.net/~nickbrown2k2/news.html
