So, at 8, we are supposed to meet (me, CQ, WQ, XC and HM). XC was very late, but oh well.  HaHa! We arrived there at 8.45, but the meeting doesn't start till 9.30. Oh my! We were given a form with our PIN and some booklet regarding the PAE exercise. I can only choose like....five or so JCs lor. I am choosing Pioneer JC....hm. I hope I am making the right choice.   After the exercise, we stayed in school (don't know whatever for). After that, me, XC, HM and EeChuang left lor. We were originally going to bowl, but WQ the organiser backed out at the last minute, and we were left with no choices.  First, we went to eat at LJS. We had to wait a while after breakfast hours, and for the fishes and fries to be fried. This time, I was careful enough not to get tricked. And I didn't. HaHa! We discussed a lot of things, like the reason why Mrs Chew is leaving RSS. She said she needed a change of environment. According to my analysis, I think it's because of Mrs Singh. It's a well-known fact among our class that Mrs Chew can't tolerate Mrs Singh's attitude. If not, it's either a relationship with colleague gone sour, or she feels she was being ostrasized. Meow!! My analysis can be correct you know!  After that, we went up to buy tickets to a movie. We are watching Uptown Girls. Finally!! Get to watch that movie! But the movie starts at 1.20, and we got 1 hour ++ to shop. so, we went around Causeway Point looking for Christmas presents.   Me, HM and XC went up at 1.10 (EC gone home). We brought popcorns, drinks, then went inside the cinema. Woah! Uptown Girls is such a cool movie! Funny and it got a touching storyline at the end. I pitied both the main actresses as they faced through life's difficulties. Hm!   After the movie, we went more shopping. The last thing we did was print NeoPrint pics. HaHa! My hair was so cut! So ugly...hehe. The overall effect ws nice la. So moo meow.   I went back home, took a bath and watched taped Holland V. I am gonna watch the rest of the taped tapes tomorrow. O.o!! After that, it's a night of TV watching and online surfing. I am goning to go to Escape Theme Park on Wed with the rest of the music students. Moo meow!  Okay. I gotta be going le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
