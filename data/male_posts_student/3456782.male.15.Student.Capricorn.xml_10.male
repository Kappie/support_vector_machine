To offer more proof, for you skeptical people, I put a grasshopper in the aquarium and he didn't turn into a fish. I'm surprised by my own genius, I can't believe that for so long people have believed the evolution theory and it is proven false by something so simple. On a related note, I need money for a new fish, if anyone would like to donate, leave the money anywhere in the new park that's still under construction outside my house. Don't worry, I'll find it, just make sure it smells like steak for my dog to detect it.
