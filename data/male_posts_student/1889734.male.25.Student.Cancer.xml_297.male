I have a BS in Physics from UT, and I really want to go back to school here in Kalamazoo to pursue English.  But I'm unsure how to proceed, and I'd like to get my facts straight before I speak with an advisor over there and reveal my ignorance.  The question is, since I have a degree already, am I required to attend as a Graduate Student?  Or is my degree even relevent since it isn't anything like English?  Ideally, I'd like to simply take English courses with a focus on writing.    Anyone know anyone with Grad school experience and how it works?
