I'm the one on the blog who always gets yelled at for not posting enough or for posting really stupid entries or for saying "lol" a lot.  So, welcome again!  hehe.    I have no idea about any of those crazy people for president.  I'm stupid, remember?  But, seriously, anyone is better than Bush.  Based on names, the Skeleton gets my vote.  :D.  Anyway, I swear I had something better to say!  OH!  PAJAMA GAME!  I can come Sunday night...going to a movie Saturday night and another play Friday night...so Sunday night's the only time I can come, but I WANNA SEE IT WITH YOU ALL!  So Sunday is the only way, got it?!  Okay, now I'm done.  Bye!   Why shake hands when we can touch...other things? Like Lips...[hehehehehehehehe]
