Not in because they had a person in mind for president and if i was among the few they were worried mrs.neo would pick me because of my speaking skills and the way i handled the interview,so they killed the threat before it could do anything.  Despicable, not really politics is after all a dirty game, but i am truly disasapointed, because they have revealed that they have their own agendas, to accomplish and are treating the whole selection process as a mere formality.  I cannot do anything about it accept question whether after so much investment, had i chose the right group? was i actually promoting deceit?  I am sorely dissapointed at the way we have decieved and (remember wha ti said about an ellaborate joke?) i ,well i not know it is quite true.  May the next president be stronger and more willing to step forward and run the council. I am not condeming the current three but the system which stiffles people into making it a day to day thing, circumstance makes us what we are.  Good luck to the rest running espeacially you, Love, byron
