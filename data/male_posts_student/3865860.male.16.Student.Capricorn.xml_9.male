I had quite a fun story going for me when i was a zebra who had been outcasted from the herd because i had superpowers. I had to go live in america and fight crime, it was kinda like spiderman because no-one could find out who i was. As fun as the stories were they didn't distract me from how shit i was feeling. Got up today at 7.00am and i havent eaten anything all day feels like im gunna puke when i smell food. Today has been so lame i've been bored because i cant do anything because im too tired and i feel like shit. I think i have food poisoning from drayton manor, crappy amusement park food they should be reported. Anyhoos i will start writing better stuff when i feel better. Sorry if i have snapped at you and said some stuff i don't mean its just because i feel so bad.  Tom
