In school, i kept my head on the table most of the time, and i kinda fell asleep soon after, if not struggling hard to stay awake. CME lesson talked about what we shld do when we are out on a date... crap, everyone will be in their best right... to leave a good first impression.. SE would be better... :x   Went to Century Square with Sherman after that, off to whack WMMT and ID. In the end we ended up playing WMMT only... with a few sidekicks of ID V3.. i got my timing down to 4'44, using BB on New Belt Line CW.. and then, after that i started to get a little tired liao.. on the way home i nearly fell asleep on the cab..   At home i wonder why today i'm playing CS for a long while.. playing all the funny maps.. and stupid Willy told Shu Yun i NEED a girl... i was like (-.-)"  Playing Linkin Park - Numb on my com as i'm typing this entry...   YES I AM going NUMB... OBLIVIOUS....
