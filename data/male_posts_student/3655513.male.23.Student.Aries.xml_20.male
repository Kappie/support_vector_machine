With the upcoming Summer Olympic Games in Greece this year, I recently took a moment to reflect on this fact and wonder.  Now the moment I took to reflect on this fact was at 7:00am on my Sunday morning. You see at 7:00am this morning I was awakened by over 6000 people standing outside my apartment building for the watching of, and/or participating in the event known as the Calgary Marathon. The bozo who organized this event thought that it would be prudent to start their course and set up their sound booth and speakers DIRECTLY in front of my building, beneath my 3rd floor balcony no less. So with sappy music blaring (aside from the starting moment where Yanni's "Chariots of Fire" supplimented the sappy music) and a single-barrel 12-gauge shotgun used as the starting instrument rather than a starting pistol, 6000 people screamed, cheered, and congregated in front of the building where I was trying to sleep.  You can only imagine, during this moment, the particular types of reflection that I was doing in my mind on the physcological stability and social ineptability of athletes, professional or ameteur, and how they interact on the culture around them.  All that being said....I'm going to try and get some more sleep.  Shalom.
