I am working on the next chapter, a little bit everyday, and won't release it till I polish it. I think I am getting in a rut with my writing; pardon my audacity if you will, to call this as my "writing" in the first place, but nevertheless. I get the feeling that my spontaneity is affecting my writing, so to speak, so I plan to write and re-write and re-write till I give up. (Sid, I am trying to take a leaf out of your books, so get ready to share the blame if I fail in my quests). I think I am trying to make my blogs sound more like "my writing", rather than just day-in-day-out posts, although I don't guarantee that "more careful" writings will ever make me lose my spontaneity or will make my future blogs any better reads. But an effort's being made to try and develop a style here. I have to admit, blogging has sort of whetted my appetite for writing, a hobby that I sometimes regret not having taken seriously, years ago.  I tried to Bend it like Beckham on Saturday, while playing soccer at the University Village Olympics (!!). I think even Sid did. And we ended up cooling our heels, literally! We both twisted our feet badly, in almost the same exact manner, just a different leg. Worse, as a team of soccer novices, compared to our opponents - yours truly shamefully being the #1 novice - we were thrashed in the final by some well seasoned players. Well, we played just two matches, and although we won the first - technically a semifinal - the final was the soundest thrashing I have ever received in any form of a game I have ever played. I think I seem to care about the most insignificant of games I have ever played, and then a sport like soccer, which I don't even remember playing since passing out of school. Could barely walk for half a day and the pain was excruciating. I better stick to badminton.  And then, I invited Shaun and Carrie for dinner on Sunday. Spent almost the whole day/afternoon cleaning and cooking. To top it all, my destructive nature, which happened to be on an indefinite break, HAD to creep up at the wrong time. I made some last minute groceries in the afternoon and as soon as I started making Ras Malai, spilled the boiling half n half milk. Time to mop and clean more, and then another quick rush to the grocery to get another half n half. By 5 pm, the alarms went off (not really), and dinner was ready. Made Pav Bhaji, Veg Biryani, Ras Malai and Salad ("Koshimbir", really). The rest of the evening was a "gappa" session with Shaun and Carrie, hearing stories about their honeymoon trip to Mt. Kilimanjaro/Tanzania, and watching their huge collection of trip pictures and video clippings. There cannot be a better honeymoon, and I can't wait for mine to happen.  It's Monday; the weekend exhaustion is starting to show up at the wrong time - for a change, not getting enough of sleep is neither the reason nor the excuse. I have no other option but to gear up for another impending research meeting.
