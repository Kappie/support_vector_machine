First hor, we went to the Lot 1's popular. It's the biggest in Singapore, so we can get something. My mother told us not judge the size of the store, the goods it carries makes a huge difference. Yeah. You can guess what happened. The store was kinda pathetic...even more so than Causeway's Popular.  Therefore, we went to the Popular in Causeway Point. In the end, I brought 'The Five People You Meet In Heaven', 'The Wish List' and Ma Jiang Wang, a Chinese game of MahJong. :)  I came back and started playing MahJong. Well, to my dismay, the Chinese characters came out as garbage. All squares squares lines lines dash dash. Ayioh! My HansWare also cropped out. I need to buy the latest version of HansWare (which will only be brought during my Mother's next off day. Today is her off day ma).   After playing MahJong with lousy Chinese words,  I went to eat dinner and make a new pair of specs. We ate chicken rice. Okay. Specs. I finally got a metal frame spectacls. I took great care in choosing the lens shape. I want a thin oval-ish kindan shape to complement my small eyes. Then, it's time for the color. I got two smiliar versions of a pair of spectacles, uin two different color. One was black, the other was metallic blue. I had a hard time choosing the color. I called Wendy, she said black. My mother said black too. However, I made a coin toss again. 2/3 wins. The first two times, it was one blue, one black. The last toss said that I should choose blue, so I did. Then, it was time to measure my degrees. Goodness! My degrees has gone into a thousand each eye. Oh my god! I must take care of my eyes more. In the end, we brought the two frames. The black one is a 'spare', just in case something went wrong to the blue one.  Oh.... today hor, the chinese newspapers were having a field day with the report of Huang Yi Liang 'suaning' his wife during his thank-you speech. He meant it as a joke I guess. MeiJiao accepted it as a joke. That's good. HaHa! Today Bao Mei Li was funny. HAHAHA!! Qi shu lin!  Hm...what else ar? Ayiah... I know I wanted to say something one. Oh yes! Tomorrow, Melvin invited me and his friends to his house to celebrate his birthday. :) Me, Ben and HM are buying his prezzie tomorrow. We are meeting at 1015. I wonder if Causeway Point opens by then. Oh, Wendy confirmed it opens at 10. Okay.   Hm...nothing else to report on liao. Okay...gotta go write Wendy's testimonial. Mad woman (:P joking ar joking ar) is rushing for it. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
