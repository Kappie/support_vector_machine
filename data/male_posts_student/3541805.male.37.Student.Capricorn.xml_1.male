I couldn't believe it when I looked over at my wife about half way through the fim....She had fallen a sleep. She says she is not feeling well. But, I think it is the stress. Its also wearing me out.   Normally, I am very active and sporty. Cycling about 12 hours per week give or take an hour or two. But, this week I have not been on the bike once. I need to start riding agian tomorrow.  Tired now. Just pulled out the futon matress onto the second bedroom floor.I have been sleeping in here for about two months now. With the occassional swap for the bed when my neck has been killing me.....I miss my real bed.
