This might've something to do with the fact that I didn't go to sleep before 2 o'clock in the morning, or it might be the fact that I'm a lazy FotherMucker. Although I would put my money on the first one. Soon I'm going to mow the lawn, which has grown to a massive length so that should be fun... yeah. Man it's boring here! I want to play tennis so much (this seems to be my new passion)! And this craving was only fueled when I found a very pro racket in the garage. It even had pro in it's name: Skillbuilder Pro. So I can't wait to do some damage with it, if my dad let's me borrow it that is. And I can only play tennis in Mosjoen! Arrgh! Damn you Korgen for your lack of tennis-courts! But seeing as I'm going there next week, all I have to do is to bide my time, and think happy thoughts... Like that's ever going to happen.  I'm reading the 5th Harry Potter - book now, and I didn't get the urge to read more and more, which I did with the other books. Maybe I've outgrown them, or maybe Rowling's creativity has depleted. Well I've only read 4 chapters so it's still early to give my verdict of the book. Maybe I'll finish it this weekend. It's not like I have anything better to do... Oh! Wait a minute, there's the lawn isn't it... Darnation, ah well. Best to get it over with.  Later  Song Of The Day:  Incubus - Are You In(?)
