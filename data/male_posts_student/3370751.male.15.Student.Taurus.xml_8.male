Now that I have it, you can do nothing but read the whole thing and leave a comment.     urlLink Study     urlLink Cannibals     urlLink Deodorant     urlLink Questions     urlLink Assignments        STUDY    I did nothing but study this weekend.  Well, I'm not  going  to do anything but study this weekend; it's only sunday and saturday counts as a weekday because I say so.    1.) Work on Pathways Final.  An email interview with Professor Don Thorsen of Theology from APU.  Should be very interesting.  I have to write a report and do an oral speech.    2.) Make an English Portfolio.  Benchmarks, essays, and stuff go inside the folder.  I also have to write a "Dear Reader" letter.  Gee, like people can't read essays without proper instructions from the author.    3.) Study for Spanish.    4.) Study for Math.  5.) Study for P.E.    Wait, what?      CANNIBALS    I watched Hannibal on USA yesterday.  Spoookkyy.  Anyway, I wonder: Could any one we know be a cannibal?  Are you born a cannibal?  After thinking awhile about the movie, I came to the conclusion that all cannibals are evil psychos who get off watching people scream in pain.  But, then, I thought about the 3rd world countries who have ancient tribes or whatnot that practice cannabilism.  And it occured to me that the Greeks and Romans practiced cannabilism too; and they certainly are not evil psychos who get off watching people scream in pain.    On the contrary, they were quite civilized; we actually owe alot to the Greeks.  They gave us theater, philosophy, politics, democracy, and so on.  So my conclusion now is that canniblism is instinct; rather than a murderer's desire, it's a cannibal's need.  They know no other way to survive, so obviously they eat people.  Still a scary thought though.      DEODORANT    On a lighter note, I had a dream I married deodorant.  Old Spice Pure Spirit to be exact.  I think it was because  urlLink Andrew  and I were discussing the origins of deodorant for like 5 hours.  And how it actually came 20,000 light years away from the sun on a planet called Eath.  Not Earth, Eath.  Interesting, yes?      STUDY QUESTIONS    1.) Why do you think saturday is actually a weekday, and not a weekend?  Keep in mind that I am right, and the calendar of the whole world is wrong.    2.) Are you a cannibal?    3.) The Greeks invented democracy.  Who invented the toilet?    4.) Where does deodorant come from?      ASSIGNMENTS    1.) Write a full thesis on why toilets keep the Earth and Eath in order from total civilization chaos.    2.) Form an outline on the full thesis.    3.) Write an essay based on the outline.    4.) Due Monday.     A NOTE   I wonder why I'm demanding homework from what I write in my blog now.  I swear, the finals are getting to me.  Good luck guys.  And remember summer is just over the scantrons.  Oh great, summer school starts the week after.  One of these days I'm going to die, and they'll ban finals.  I'll be a hero.
