On Friday, it was the closing session so all the awards were given out and so forth. I had a great time at the conference. Although I did not place in the top 10 for Website Development, I'm still happy I was able to go to this conference. It has been a great experience and I'm looking forward to the conference in November... the FBLA Fall Leadership Conference. Now it's Sunday and I'm gonna go take a bus soon with the AZ Delegation to the airport. I should be back at around 7 PM tonight AZ time or sooner. Have a great one!
