These are my comments to that by number:  1. Karma supposedly returnes when the time is right so maybe if she had waited just a little longer, she would have gotten what's for her. 2. Look at it from his point of view, she's there. She feels as inadequate as she. Why wouldn't he? And it made it more tragic. I like writing sad endings. I don't know why. 3. I was actually going to make her pregnant with his child or *gasp* another guy's child but then, the leader nixed the idea because she said that Anna didn't seem like the type to have sex in such a short relationship (3 months, I think) with the guy. (Hah! As if the character was patterned on her behavior) But if one thinks about it, she's just such a wanna-be-perfect girlfriend that she probably would have agreed because of her need to give the guy everything she can and make him so happy. (In her point of view) Considering the patterns of today's youth, she would do the nasty with him.  But with your observation, I'd have to disagree, relationship with sex is much more bound to fail because sex puts a haze in a relationship that makes it seem so great. Other considerations are put in the back-burner, especially with the young but when sex starts to cool down, they suddenly see each other in another light and sometimes, they find out they don't really like each other at all. 4. I agree. 5. People who are considered good by others but consider themselves bad want to die young.  6. Look at it like this, 99-100 is 1.0 97-98 is 1.25 96 is already 1.5 which makes you ineligible for a scholarship.  7. I don't understand the 7th one so if you'd care to explain. 8. That's why my diary is online and very few people know the url. 9. Don't really know. Doesn't happen to my barkada. Happens in the orgs, though. 10. True.  11. Why 10 comments?
