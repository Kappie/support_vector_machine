He handed me a large box. I new it was the barebone computer system I ordered off eBay. So I took it inside and opened it up. There is was in all of its pride and glory. After I transferred all the components over from my old case to the new one, I fired it open and BAM!! – Nothing. After hours of troubleshooting and on hold with tech support we finally found out it was the motherboard (Had the feeling all along). So now I have to send that back in and wait another 2 weeks to have my new system. CRAP  Every Friday in English we have to write a 20 line journal. So I thought it would be a good idea to post it up on my website. I’ll probably create a new blog for it. I don’t know. Second day of school was off OK. I had a little fight with the school sys admin (or the wanna be admin) about getting IP address for some computers. No no, he wants to come and install Novell. The last thing I want is Novell on the Dells. I guess I will have to make up some IP numbers and hope he never stops by. Friday was just a bad day period…….  I had to go and tape the football game against Sidney High School. We won by a couple points. It was funny because there school is very old and we were taping out of a classroom and Mr. Spencer was out on the roof and pieces of plaster were falling from the floor above. If that wasn’t scarry enough every time the other team scored they shot off a cannon and it startled Spencer every time. Then we toped the night off eating Rallies. I do love their fries but the sandwiches are getting smaller and smaller.   I have been looking at a lot of blogs lately. I guess I need to start updating the  urlLink links  section of my homepage. Blogs are cool. They are a great way to express yourself and tell people about yourself. Lookin at this blog right now:  urlLink Oomphe-Girl . Her name is Rachel, 15, and lives in Canada. She is a geek and likes  urlLink TSS  too. That’s cool. Someday maybe we will meet. That's It! Have a great big  urlLink TechTV  Fan gathering. That would be alsome!!! Have the whole cast come and travel around for a week to meet people and sign autographs. That would be cool. Gee, I guess I am obsessed with  urlLink Leo  and Pat. O well, I will get to meet them some time or another. Thinking about a road trip after I graduate. Make my way around America, stop and meet some people, make new friends and visit some old ones. I would also like to visit my cousins in Kentucky. Kentucky is SOOO laid back.   Just Dreaming Here!  Dam, almost a page in MS Word. LONG blog entry this time. We’ll see how the next one goes.  As always, ±±Eric±±
