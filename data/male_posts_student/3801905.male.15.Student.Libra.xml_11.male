The thought comes to every person when they hit that “create blog” button for the first time. ‘What if people really like what I write?’. ‘Maybe I’ll have people checking my blog site everyday to see if I’ve posted’. The lack of judgment on appearance and looks there is just what they think and write. For some this idea seems fantastic, a place where everyone likes you, just for you. I guess we’re all searching for that place. When all the world is so full of ideas and rules on how you should walk, talk, look, smell. It’s so full of guidelines and ways of going about doing things. To not follow these, social rules, leads to being called strange, weird, freak. A place where there are no boundaries, no limitations, truly this must be paradise.
