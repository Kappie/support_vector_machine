Yesterday:   It was a good day, you know, the kind of day you have in the middle of the summer that's actually fun? I skipped church because I had to mow a lawn, and then relaxed for a few hours in the afternoon. Walked the dogs, did the dishes, and picked up Emily (a friend of mine who's a friend of Amanda's) at 4:00. *Why I hate the Teen Center Sometimes* They close prematurely on Sundays because, "no one was in there." We were going to be in there! Eh, I guess it couldn't have been better than taking a walk around the area, playing some ping-pong, and listening to music and chatting, could it? ...nah      Today: Today was pretty hot and sticky, and yet I still played Ultimate Frisbee after my lunch of 1 Quaker Chewy bar. I had to work through the lunch hour on my speeches for debate because I was sick on Friday and didn't do any work over the weekend. Needless to say, I kicked major ass in the debates. Everyone's saying I'm the best in the class, and I guess I very well may be (see how modest that was?). Plus there's this girl (Sofia)that's kinda likin' me, but it's not happening. I have no interest in her whatsoever.      After MITY, and watching Ken Jennings win his 34th game of Jeopardy, I headed off to Park High for marching band, which was really hot and sticky, once again. First rehearsal in over a month, and we weren't as bad as I had thought we would be. To add the physical and mental exhaustion that I'm currently experiencing, I had to wait over a half hour for my mom to get there. More like 45 minutes. We got out of band at 8:50, and she didn't get there until 9:35 because she was on the damned phone. Typical, isn't it?
