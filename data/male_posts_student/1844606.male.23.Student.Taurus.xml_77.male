And reader be aware this is esoteric, but I've realized the reason travel and my precived inability to do it, comes from my association with travel to relationships.  Because all the relationships I see around me that are somewhat decent all seem to have the common element of traveling together.  And its something I've always wanted to do, even before traveling carried so many other implications.   I'm also starting to feel very pissed off again, cerca last fall, and this isn't a good thing cause for the most part I'm feeling better, but things ain't right.  School is pissing me off, my roommate's myopic self view is pissing me off, and an inability to truely express my thoughts to someone without fear of being judged are all plauging me at the moment.  Will these things change soon?  The grades maybe, the outlook, that's gonna take some more work
