The bed is cast-iron so it was awful to move, but I like where it is a whole lot better. Computer and drawers were about the only thing that stayed in the same place, but she painted the drawers too so it would brighten up the room a bit.  I haven't gotten to read any in my book today or much of yesterday because of that, but I am on page 265. Once I'm done with this there are only 2 more books in the series. School starts Monday so I'm trying to get my room straightened up and trying to get the books done before school too.  Anyway.... enough about school. Off I go.
