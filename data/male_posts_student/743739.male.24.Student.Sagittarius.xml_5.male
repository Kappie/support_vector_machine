An ESPN film crew is coming to this Panhandle town next month to interview the family of 2-year-old ESPN Malachi McCall for a feature on several children around the country named after the network.   ESPN (pronounced Espen) McCall is one of at least three children in the United States known to be named for the sports network. A couple in Corpus Christi named their son Espn Curiel in 2000, the same year Espen Blondeel was born in Michigan."   ----------------------------------------------------------------  Wow, and I thought the name Asa was weird.... just kidding bud. However this article has provided me with inspiration. My first kid will be name Pepsi Coke Luttrell. Think about it, it works perfectly. Then all I will have to do is convince him (or her, doesn't really matter) to get a PhD and then the name will be Dr. Pepsi Coke Luttrell.    And yes, its official now, I will never show this blog to any girl that I meet.
