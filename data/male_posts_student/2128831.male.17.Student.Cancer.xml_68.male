I swear I didn't know that you were related and I am truly sorry...  But most importantly, I just wanted you to know, I think I love you.  You didn't glare at me like my teddy bear did last night when I came in at 2 a.m. You didn't remind me how I had killed so many brain cells with a concoction of weird girly drinks and beer. You didn't reprimand me for slapping that guy for-whatever-reason-that-made-perfect-sense-last-night and even reminded me that I've only slapped perhaps two people in my life.  Instead, you gushed about the random call from boy and laughed about the cute guy who picked me up. Literally picked me up to move in front of me to protect me from slapped-guy who was threatening to punch me. And most importantly? When I told you that I kicked butt at racing cars at Dale‘s you didn't laugh and point out 'how cute a girly-girl' I was. You just hung out in my bowl and stayed cool and kept a straight face. And finally, thank you for not making fun of the fact that I can't seem to say 'no' and got suckered into working for free.  I'll miss the spooning when I'm on a diet. Perhaps we'll write. Love,  Will   Help! I'm living life in a fishbowl! I can't seem to see through the icky green slime coating the inside from the little fishies in here. Have I mentioned that fish freak me out? Ok. Gross fish imagery. But really, don't you ever feel like you're completely changing atmosphere and location when you do different things? No? Have no ideas what the heck I'm talking about? That's fine too.  I suppose I feel like I'm living a triple life. It's weird. I can't possibly explain without risk of being put away. And then what would you do without the white noise? You know what? I'm tired of sharing. That's what it is. I've shared since I was 0, Dammit. That's enough time. Gimme my stuff back! *shove* I'm also hungry. But that would require effort. Look, it's been a long day. I've been up since 7 and had meetings and then class all day AND I had to kill 3 bosses on level nine for my nephew. It's exhausting being this cool. It's not for the weak-minded.  Careful kids! Wear some wrist guards and a helmet. Yeah. Are there actually people who have sexy voices when they're sick? People keep making jokes about my voice and then we agree that I decidedly do not sound sexy. So who are these sexy sounding people who overcome illness and coughing and boxes of Kleenex? I feel sorta like Meg Ryan in You've Got Mail. Cute as usual, ;) but not sexy sounding. She just sounds gross and sick. Okay enough! So I've been thinking about memories and the whole lacunainc.com parody thingy. If you could get rid of memories, would you? I haven't seen the movie but I, personally, would not. My immediate reaction was hell-yeah! But as someone wise pointed out, then I wouldn't remember why my exes made me mad or why it was bad to touch a hot iron. (Two rather similar circumstances I do assure you!)  However, despite repeated incidents, I still make the same mistakes. I still end up with the all-nighters and broken hearts.  Why, hello Melodrama! Glad you could stop by!  But seriously, it's like knowing that there's a huge scary purple blob with seven (or for those whom can’t understand the written form 7) eyes in the closet but you keep opening the door despite past experience of how hard it is to shut the door once it's opened. I need a deadbolt.  Or less sinus medication that makes me weirder than usual.  Blog is the stupidest thing I have ever heard. I am going to go blog your face into little pieces. I am going to go blog at the next flag football game. It suits all situations. Gotta tell your kid to stop doing drugs just say this, "You're the stupidest little blog that I have ever bloggin' seen when I was younger we got blogged for just thinking about it, Blog you." Some people call me hot sauce since I am so skilled in every way possible just like hot sauce you know. Since this is one of those stupid posts on this bound to be interesting site, I will describe my right kneecap... I guess it can be described as elliptical and definitely not soft. In summary my kneecap is not French.  I wish seeing Riley was easier, I heart the boi massively.  He is so frickin’ amazing yall!  *sighs* More things from the bathroom floor.  When I met you boy you was the sweetest thing Like a Sade tape in the coldest spring When I saw your eyes I thought they shined for me Just being in your space was divine me Gave you true smiles and a lot more time Then them balling cats who fiend to be mine... And some would say I should have never came closer But I ain't never had the taste for the phrase not supposed to So I chose imagine that Put a plan into play to make it public fact That I'm the one and you should have knew That them other bois have never loved you like I do Might have took some time but most good things do Manifest when the time is true I admit I was nervous ‘cause things get changed Something about my lifestyle makes love so strange So many angles and tangled components Everybody wanna touch just for the moment But you put a new hue in my blue Added a perspective to my concrete views About tossing caution into the breeze Following emotion like streams to the seas Top priority believe you me Like love how you feel, you alright, what do you need? It's more than your lips on the nap of my neck Or your hands on my chest, with your leg on my thigh Or the look in your eyes as you slide inside It's the way you make me melt and fall apart even though I’ve tried Baby, I heart you so much  And can’t wait again to the telephone or to the touch
