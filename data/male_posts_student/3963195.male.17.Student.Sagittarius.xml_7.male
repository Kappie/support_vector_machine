I and my fellow first years at the college were forced to attend the march, first we went around the college shouting slogans and after that we proceeded towards the road. We tried to get out many times but then they didn’t leave us we were surrounded. And I could hear some of my seniors saying to each other not to loose a good opportunity to throw stones at the police. I was very much terrified in hearing this, I gradually decreased my pace, and I came last so that I could run back into the college in case of an attack…the march was due to a suicide of a student caused due to negligence of the government…………….Any how the march was not a success from the part of the organizers as to me it was a close shave…………..when the march reached near the armed police van it started raining…………………. If it had not been raining at that time I wouldn’t have been here now to write this story……………………………….
