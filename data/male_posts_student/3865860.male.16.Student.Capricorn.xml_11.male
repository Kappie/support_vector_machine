New comp is sooooooo much faster and it now goes whirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr instead of hummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm(louder). Went to Drayton Manor yesterday its was quite cool went on everything apocolypse (once is enough). Felt like i was gunna puke after i went on pandimonuim but i didn't, Yay! Saw this really fit rocker chick who i thought i pulled but i probably didn't, lol it is me after all. She was tres good looking though, oh well i gotta expect it. When we were waiting for shockwave we noticed that they were only letting people on one of the cars. It made you wonder what was wrong with that one. Also when we were halfway up the incline of shockwave i noticed my safety bar thingy was kinda loose, not good to find that out before you are just about to go over a loop and two corkscrews, got a good pic though :) All in all that day was quite cool just Drayton Manor is starting to get boring now i've been there too many times, i really wanna go back to Alton Towers mmmmmm Alton Towers mmmmm Overpriced. Today i didn't do much im still really tired and i don't know why. Oh yeah i forgot to tell you i now have a new best friend called froggy. Hes my little mascot he rules so much, hes so mini hes great. I can't believe i forgot about him he is soooooooo cool. Anyway i just noticed that the times are in GMT after all thats good. Today was going so well until 2.30pm when i started feeling uber sick. I still feel like it now, massive headache dizziness and a really sickky tummy :( I had to go get my D of E booked signed by my former Tai Chi Teacher, that gave me an even bigger headache. To be fair all I wanna do now is sleep, i've got a damn guitar lesson tomorrow and i have to go pick my laptop up from school. Why it takes 1hr 40 mins to do that is past me. You're not gunna get any random thoughts tonight i feel to unwell.  I will speak to you guys when im feeling better (hopefully tomorrow)  Tom
