In other news, Mongolian BBQ has been had last night with Sam, John, Willa, Ilana and JP. Afterwords there was random walking, bookstoredness with musicsuchness (whereupon I acquired a Spine - 3*bleem points for the reference). Then there was ice cream and a lively debate with a Nader signature gatherer which ultimatley included Woodorw Wilson, the Bull-Moose party, Asian colonialism, tax policy, the nature of choice, the ultimate significance and purpose of voting, and such. Then John and I debated Lizzie's proposal to send 'feminist missionaires' to third world countries promoting equal rights and societal treatment for women, which John though might amount to cultural imperialism. The debate promtly collapsed when John made some atrocious metaphor about "coating an entire tree with pesticide but leaving one bee-hive on one branch untouched". On the upside, Willa still loves us both.  This morning there was violence at the office where John's dad works. Apparently there's blood and the reporter who was supposed to be there isn't. His mom blames the AP. Heh.  One bit of positive news: I just ordered 20 bags of coffee. Oh, and I got my paycheck.  And I have 3D glasses.
