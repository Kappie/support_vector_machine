I was in John's room trying to fix the internet, and as usual, his radio was tuned to NPR. But they had something cool! They were telling a story about Demetri Martin. They said how he was (is?) a writer for Conan in addition to his stand up and that he dropped out of law school so he could tell jokes for a living. They played a couple of his bits, and they were really, really Mitch Hedburg-esque. His voice sounds like Mitch's; laid back, nonchalant. How they both laugh along with the audience after each joke, but not in an annoying self-centered way that a lot of comedians have. In the bits they played, he had soothing guitar music in the background, which reminded me of the jazzy bass in the background of  Strategic Grill Locations . I want to see his Comedy Central Presents now.  Patton was totally on "Reno 911." Patton totally rocks. I totally need to hear his new Cd. I totally need to stop with this 'totally' crap. If I keep going on with this 'totally' thing then I guess that makes me 'totally' lame.  Last night while I was talking about Ray Bradbury's satirical sci-fi books and short stories, I told her about the idea for a story I had. After I saw  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  I really had the urge to try to write something really creative like that. So I came up with a premise.  Just that it would be based around a machine. A machine that can go into your brain and delete memories and feelings of your choice, whenever you want to. So every time you read a book or saw a movie that had an unexpected twist ending, it would be the first time you saw it. And it would be like that for everything. If a great food starts to lose its flavor, you can start over and experience the taste for the first time. If your sex life gets boring and monotonous, then you can start over and it will be like the first time, when there was passion involved.  But that's all I have, and due to my laziness and lack of creative writing ability, I've so far only written less than a page, and have no ideas on how to continue. I'd accept help, if one were to offer it.  Kind of short for my first non-Xanga post.  (The title is a palindrome. Demetri is the King of Palindrome Island.)
