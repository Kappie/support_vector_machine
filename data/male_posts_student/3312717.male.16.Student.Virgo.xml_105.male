However the whole pain down my side thing had nothing to do with Jesus.  Most of your responses were way off the charts.  What do you people think of me.  I don't have any "teenager" problems, whether it be girls or conforming to coolness. Uggg...  Anyway I'm glad to hear that you guys beat the goat.  My weekend looks free for Halo if anyone is hosting.  I got my first car.  Yep, '93 Ford Taurus.  Mint.   My drivers test is July 13th though.  Note to Mattson: I'm really sorry for not coming with you guys tonight, but seriously, what would you do in my situation.  Sweet corn or movie?   I promise I'll try and go next time.  I am definitly going to Spider-Man 2, June 30th.
