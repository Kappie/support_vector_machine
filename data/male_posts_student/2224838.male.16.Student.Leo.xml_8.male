Once I have finished the game I haven't really gotten anything out of it accept the enjoyment that I had while playing. Video games consume so much of my time because I have nothing else that I would rather spend time doing right now. If I had some form of constructive hobby I would not waste several hours a day on video games. For some reason I have had trouble taking interest in much outside of school. While my junior year should offer me a endless supply of things to do, without some sort of escape I will tire quickly. So while I am striving to get the last 30 pro points of  THPS4 , maybe I can come up with something more constructive to do than playing video games...
