Tonight's edition of Late Night Bloggin' is early because...well, I have to get up at 5:30 in the morning so I can go work in the guidance office at school before I go to Camp Orlando. Tonight I'm looking at three new blogs. Here they are:     urlLink The Squared Circle of my Mind   Rating: *    I don't like this one. He's talking about parties, and biking, and stuff I don't care about. He claims to be the Innovator of Awesomeness, but we all know that I take that title, thanks to my creation of Late Night Bloggin'.Therefore, this kid may be on my shitlist or something. I dunno. But, anywho. I don't like him. That's all I want to say.     urlLink eh...something long and in Spanish   Rating: ****    That's right. 4 stars. Why? Because I can't understand it, because its in spanish. So, no complaints about someone's boyfriend sleeping with some other girl, or anything that gets slightly annoying after a while (if there is, I can't read it, because its in Spanish!). So, this guy gets my Blog of the Month that's Not Blog of Bagel Award. In fact, I like this one so much, that it makes the guy's blog that I reviewed above look like crap. Sorry dude, but that's the way it is.     urlLink Vana'diel?   Rating: *  Good god. A blog with pictures about Final Fantasy. Now, if you know me, you'd know that I can't stand Final Fantasy. It is the most god awful series of games in the world, and should have ended after its second installment. So, this person just posts pictures of Final Fantasy XI Online. Whata waste of blog space. That makes two blogs that I don't like today.  Well, that about does it. Tomorrow morning, I'm leaving for Yearbook Camp. So, I'll post something before I head off...then I'm all audio until Thursday. Then, Thursday night, with Late Night Bloggin', that ends the blogging season, meaning I'm going on vacation. Then, I'll come back in August with more new blog features! So, just in case I don't get around to my last post in the morning, look for my Audio blog posts all week long, and I'll be back to end this blog season.
