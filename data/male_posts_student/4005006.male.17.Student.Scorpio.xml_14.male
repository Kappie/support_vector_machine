No.  4 identical messages... Panic starts to set in, what could it be "Some Sad News About ------" scared now i read on in horror about my friend who has suffered horrible things throughout their life and how last night made their worst attempt at committing suicide yet....  I'm pretty shocked by all of this, very worried about my friend. I ask that anyone who reads this post their condolences to my friend, who prays that she gets well from the hospital ward where she is being force fed, on drips and bloodfeeds.   Anyway... bit different mood compared to that of my last post eh? Will write later.
