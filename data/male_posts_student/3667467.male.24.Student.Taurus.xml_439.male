There's plenty of cool stuff on the DVDs, but there are no License To Ill videos, OR "She's On It," or Jimmy James. I feel like the anthology wasn't very anthologetic. Lately I've been reading weblogs by friends of mine, and they talk about politics or jobs or philosophy. Well here's a little info for you:  MY BLOG : MISCELLANIOUS CONTENT :: FOX NEWS : CONSERVATIVE REPORTING  also,  MY BLOG : MISCELLANIOUS CONTENT :: YOUR BLOG : SUBSTANTIVE CONTENT  :.  YOUR BLOG = FOX NEWS  I think that's the Law of Detachment. Dare question me, Mr. Logical? Mr. Bill O'Reilly? That's right. Dirrty Souf!
