It is not unexpected, but it is unfortuante.  My problem doesn't stem from the Republicans...they're working to protect their seats.  The problem is that, during the next election, this mess will be forgotten.  Texans won't look at Tom Delay, David Dewhurst, or any of the other state and national representatives that worked to backdoor a shady resolution that ignores current census numbers.  They won't hold their elected officials accountable for their actions.  Instead, there will be talk of lowering taxes, or talk of war, or talk of jobs, and people will concern themselves with their bank accounts, and vote for the candidate that most assures them of keeping thier bank account high.    It's not easy to debate gerrymandering...Democrats do it to their advantage as well.   But looking at Texas, and  urlLink what happened recently in Colorado , it is evident that districts with distinct ethnicities/socio-economic stati/cultures are divided for the sheer purpose of dilluting their vote.  Colorado, a state with a fairly large hispanic population, sees its hispanic neighborhoods divided down the middle between two districts, splitting thier voice between other social groupings.    An article in the Austin Chronicle a few weeks ago gave mention to an issue between Lubbock and Odessa regarding redistricting, and it's the issue that is at heart in this mess.  Currently Odessa is the hallmark city of its own district, as is Lubbock.  Under redistricting, the two cities will be in the same district.  Both cities are predominantly Republican strongholds, though Odessa's seat is currently in the hands of a long-term Democrat who is constantly re-elected by the Republicans.  Odessa, an area with a primarily agrarian economy, will lose its representative, and become the bitter stepchild to Lubbock, an area whose money is less in farming and more in commerce.  Legislation that farmers would hold stronger will be passed over by the new representative if it interferes with commercial legislation, as Lubbock's population is much larger than Odessa's.    I have no faith in any person working in the White House, and little faith in most of our congress.  But after Bush was sworn in, I found myself telling a distraught, red-faced Brandon Lawson "It's the will of the people."  My opinion was that, regardless of technicalities, in the end Bush won the electoral college.  No matter how much it upset me, America wanted Junior in office.    Today, the more I shun Tom Brokaw and other puppeted news sources and turn to alternative press, I see that I misspoke to Brandon Lawson, that he was right to want to cry as George Bush stood, palm on Bible, reciting the oath of office.  Al Gore was the will of the people, albeit by a slim margin.  One of my favorite stories from Election 2000 that was glossed over immediately regarded a number of  urlLink African-Americans who were unable to vote  (NOTE:  The first half of the email is formatting and stuff...get down halfway and it is riveting) for numerous reasons...this article talks about people turned away at the polling centers, not being given their rights, and police harassment.  It doesn't even get into the sketchiness of the Motor Voter Laws, or blockade of shuttles going from low-income areas to voting centers.    I'll support Howard Dean, Dennis Kuchinich, Wesley Clark, John Kerry...any of 'em but Lieberman and Bush.  I'll vote for them.  But at this moment I understand just how insignificant my voting power is.  Don't throw me the hoo-ha about how voting is the bedrock of America, it's what it means to be in a Democracy, I should be proud to have the right  as in the background the Battle Hymn of the Union plays .  I do vote.  I encourage everyone else to vote.  But I don't even begin to believe the false pretention that I'm changing the world with that piece of paper...backdoor politics and industrial fatcats make the decisions.  I just put on my I VOTED button and talk to News 8 about how I am participating in Democracy, and how soon the people of Iraq will be as lucky as me.
