Eurotrip, Garfield, Old School and Black Rain....not a bad day's work really.  ok its 12.31am and i wanna go to bed so i'm gonna make this entry brief:  yesterday was crap, mainly cos it was the folk's wedding anniversiry and they didnt go out or have fun or even talk nicely bout eachother...so that was a bit of a downer.  today was nice, slow, relaxed yet damn boring - shoulda done some work, coulda gone for a haircut...but no i sat on my ass.  Claire was also sweet - she told me her feelings and apparently she was talking about me constantly - shes so...words cant describe!  Haircut tomorrow hopefully!
