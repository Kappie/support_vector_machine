I called my ex and he was sleeping so he wanted to go. He didn't sound like he was sleeping. He sounded like he was getting of someone. I just asked him if he could make it on Thursday. I heard two answers. No point of raising my hopes. I feel emotionally numb. I don't think I can feel anymore nor do I want to. I don't want to risk anymore. I don't think love is worth it anymore. I shall go back to the spitefulness heart-hardened AJ. He never got hurt, he moved at a pace that it was a miracle to see him. He moved so quick that nothing had time to stick to him. The  AJ that was once is the AJ that must be. True love's embrace won't mean a dime to me.  I wrote a poem/incantation or whatever you kids want to call it.   Heart's Exit   To feel the numbness in my heart, To feel the darkness from within, To release the love that was inside, To remove what was once To feel the hardening that I call for My love be gone No longer the one to love again No longer the one to hope again To forget my heart and leave it unturned Is to give me the peace I deserve To banish you from my heart and my mind  To banish you from my sands of time To forget you ever existed And I shall roam an empty vessle But that is the price to return to me   *Maybe love isn't what it's all hyped up to be*
