Now, i must say that i'm not really into fighters all that much, but DOA looks extremely beautiful, and deep, for a fighting game.      In fact, since i cannot get it, i decided to get every movie possible about it!  Thats right.  Currently, my desktop is filled up with little winzip icons of DOA movies, waiting for me to move them into the appropriate file.  Hmmm, movies.      I need to burn some anime.  I found out today that i have less than a quarter of my hd left, around 10 gigs.  Well, to respond to that, i did burn some of the smaller anime series's that i have, the ones under a gig.  Yup, so now i have to tackle the huge Infinite Ryvius and Uuchu no Stellvia... which are both around 4.5 gigs.  Thats whats taking up all of my space!      Well, now back to chatting, i'm currently bored at the moment... considering getting an iPod... yup...    Lates
