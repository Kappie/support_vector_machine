So today i woke up at 11 and sat on my ass until 4, then i went to work, so that means i really didnt do much today. I work again tomorrow, grrrrr, but at least its only 5-8 and i dont have to work on tuesday! hurray!  Ive had the song "Brickwall views" by The Lawrence Arms stuck in my head all day long. "Dont break to many hearts, dont take to many arrows in the chest, cry comfortably and let us all know what your thinking....."  Sorry but i love that verse so i had to type it. I want to do something tomorrow after work so i think i might give shane a call or something. We are going to go buy our warped tour tickets on saturday, WOOT! dont you just love that word? woot. its such a good word. Im drinking Mountain Dew Live Wire, ITS GOOD STUFF! wow i have used the exclimation point alot and i dont know why. i have realized that and exclimation point makes any word look 10 times better, observe. Donkey. Donkey! see the "donkey" on the right is cooler. Capitals with an exclimation point just makes that word superb, observe again. Donkey! DONKEY!. See the "donkey" with the exclimation point is great but the capitalized "donkey" with and exclimation point just kicks the other donkeys ass.  I noticed that if i keep my hand in one postion for a while my thumb begins to go up and down by itself until i stop it. its like my thumb is trying to run away.  This post means nothing
