After I explain to them that no, I live in Bloomington, Indiana, a small town of 20,000 Confederate partisans and 60,000 fratboys, their next question is, "so how do you like it?"  Short answer:  I don't.  Long answer:  The problem with the long answer is that I'm getting kind of sick of repeating it.  It depresses me, and it makes me sound really negative to all of the genuinely nice and inquisitive people I meet on my trips out of town.  Therefore I have elected to begin this series, on what I hate about Bloomington.  You can check back periodically for updates, but if you know me you've heard them already.  I'll be touching on the food, the students, the nightlife, the location, and whatever else I realize really galls me about living this far south of the IHOP-Waffle House divide.   Issue One:  The food is bad and overpriced.   In a college town, and I don't mean a city with a college or two in it alongside the mass of adults with real jobs and actual responsibilities, but a town with a post office, a college,  va khalas ,  local restaurauteurs take advantage of the hordes of lite-beer/malternative guzzling Young Republicans with nothing to do but drive Daddy's SUV four blocks to burn Daddy's money at a steakhouse, charging no less than seven dollars for lunch at the sort of restaurant where in civilized places they would charge four.  I'm not an overqualified expert in this arena, because as a vegan I am able to eat in exactly three of them.  Cooking for myself is not an option.  Have you ever eaten my cooking?  I did once, and look at me now.  I am not, as one would hope, able to eat in any of the university's cafeterias.  The cafeterias are franchises of popular regional and national fast-food chains, including Burger King, Pizza Hut, and Chick-Fil-A, which I have not yet figured out how to pronounce.  There is also one called "Charleston Market".  Charleston Market appears to be the exact same thing as Boston Market, only with the name changed so as not to offend the cracker population of the state who, 138 years later, are still sore that they had to knock it off with all the slave labor.  If the University had somehow managed to retain any kind of control over their own food service, it would be conceivable that a group could lobby the school to have the menu changed.  What kind of remedy do the people have against Pizza Hut?  Not eating there?  I don't eat there anyway, and it hasn't seemed to hurt them any.  As I see it, the only way there could be any citizen input into the food served at Indiana University is if the fast-food industry were nationalized.  Not that I'm advocating that.  But it should be looked into.
