Thursday-Watched ER finally after like 3 weeks of reruns Friday- Now i must remember something b/c that was today............. um.............had a bible study...Worked on a science project... Watched Anne Frank in English which was like a big shocker (Peter sure hit it big on his first date). The Nazis were coming to take them away and then *Bang* it happened. It made everyone jump out of their seats which i thought was really funny. In bible we watched a video on evolution vs. creation. I really do believe in the Big Bang theory because when God spoke.........*Bang* it happened.   That was this week but last week was even better. First of all my bible teacher sent a 7th grader to our classroom and told my history teacher (Mr. B) that Mr. Merrell (bible teacher) wanted a aisle seat for DC because he doesnt like tight areas. So Mr. B told the 7th grader to stay in our classroom and read with us for a while. So he stayed and after like 30 minutes, Mr. M  comes marching in to our class and demands that we make a trade for students. So what ends up happening is that Mr. Merrell sent 2 of his 7th graders to stay in Mr.B's class and Mr. B sent 3 8th graders to Mr. M class. It just so happens that i had Mr. M last year for homeroom and now im one of the few that has him again this year, so over everyone he chose me to go back to his class (also half of the reason was b/c im azn and he loves the AP). For the rest of the time, i did 7th grade work in Mr. M's class while a 7th grader was doing my work in Mr. B's class. All i gotta say is good thing we we didnt have any homework or any quizes that day b/c if we did, that 7th grader would have brought my grade WAY down. I love when we do fun stuff like that! O yeah well that was during 2nd period but during 7th period the same thing happened except i was in Mr. M's class and i got transfered to Mr. B's class. I told Mr. M that i had to go b/c Mr. B felt bad when i left him. So he felt better when i transfered over back to his class. Every week is a new adventure in Mr. M's class and Mr. B's class.......Dang, i wrote a lot....if you dont get it then ill tell you personally what happened b/c it gets kinda complicated when your in class...I think ill go work on Mrs. Mass's website b/c she is the greatest math teacher on earth.
