I am a sophomore at Central Michigan University working toward a B.S. in Ed.; History major, Phys. Ed. minor.  I have recently transferred here from Lansing Community College where I attended off-and-on for six long years.  I transferred before the fall semester 2003.  Just to toot my own horn, I have made the Dean’s List for both of my semesters here.  I have recently joined the National Society for Collegiate Scholars which I have little knowledge of, but it sounds good.  For those of you who may have known me in High School it may surprise you that I have decided on becoming a teacher.  My academic experience in high school was not pleasant.  I think I ended up with a 1.12 gpa.  I was much more successful in the social aspect of HS.  I did not realize in my youth that education is a personal thing.  I regret that I allowed social bullshit to interfere with my schooling, and consequently my life.  I decided upon teaching after becoming closer to my niece and nephews, Jessica, Julius, and Kyle.  Seeing them get older and grow up is one thing that has solidified my interest in teaching.  I wish I had the knowledge at their age that I do now, so why not help others get that knowledge earlier.  I also believe that social barriers exist in our schools that are extremely detrimental to many young people.  As a teacher I will work extremely hard to provide for my charges the support they need, regardless of social position.  My hobbies are sports and music.  I played football and ran track in high school.  I have also played in various basketball and softball leagues.  I currently help my brother, Aaron, with coaching the Perrinton-Middleton Little League team, the Mud Dawgs.  We are currently 2-3.  Coaching little league has also cemented my decision to teach.  It is not easy to keep everyone behaving themselves but it is so much fun to see the kid’s progress.  I am also a big fan of Detroit professional teams.  It is not easy to be a Lions fan or a Tigers fan, but I can’t change.  I have a problem with fair-weather fans.  I also believe that it is just plain wrong to route for Green Bay if you live in Michigan.  Go Pistons!  I was 12 when the “Bad Boys” won their championships and I would love for them to win another.  My other hobby is music.  I would say it is more of a way of life than a hobby.  I play guitar; as well as drums, bass, and mandolin, and I can hack out tunes on about anything.  I had the advantage of working at the best music store in the world, Elderly Instruments, for five years.  This experience allowed me to advance my musicianship as well as gave me connections that allowed me to play in a couple of local bands.  In the late 90’s I played drums for Zephyrean Weave, a “hippy band” as some of my friends have dubbed it.  We played many shows for almost three years, until I was kicked out.  Another band that I was kicked out of is Sun King.  I played guitar in this band, but this lasted only for a brief time.  I was kicked out of these bands for two reasons:  I was young and “insensitive" and I am very anal about musical performance when it reflects on my abilities.  I guess another reason could be that I am an arrogant jerk.  My most recent band was Porno Jazz, in which I played bass.  These guys are great, they didn’t even kick me out of their band!  These guys, and gal, are still playing.  Go to one of their shows if you get a chance.  Visit the website (www.porno-jazz.com). Buy the E.P. and get a chance to listen to my bass playing.  Most importantly try the veal.  I currently just play at home for fun and practice but I would love to start a band.  I have come to the conclusion, however, that I will only be in a band playing guitar.  My influences are Zappa, Miles, Satch, Dylan, Marley, and the Beatles.  I am also heavily influenced by the “gangsta” rap of the 90s especially Ice Cube and Snoop.  Anyone interested in playing some Jazz/Blues/Funk/Hip Hop?
