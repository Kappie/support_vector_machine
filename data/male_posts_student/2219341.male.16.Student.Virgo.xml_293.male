Ellen and i joked around almost the WHOLE time!  oh goodness... the singin was awful!  we had some problems with off-keyness!  Ellen almost cried it hurt so bad!  and then we had like an Oreo party!  we were twistin oreo's to see who was the best... i got beat.  oh and then there was FABIO!  but ill leave him out of this for right now... hehehe!  then on the way back Ellen called Ben and i told him his new nickname!  ha!  that was funny!  and Brandon raced the other 2 vans home and WE WON!  so yes... i had a wonderful time.  im still kinda down bout my current woes... but im tryin to just not worry about it and let God take care of it.  i mean whatever is supposed to happen is gonna happen so why should i get so upset about all this... ha!  its alot easier to say that than to live it... but i shall try.  anyways... im very confused with life but it will be ok.  i really want to talk about this to someone... but i cant decide who... i mean everyone seems to be too busy.  which is fine... i dont expect people to stop everything for me.  but yeah... anyways.  i think i need to be off to bed now.  school tomorrow... oh joy.  but only for 8 more days i think.... man thats great... and then RAINBOW OMEGA!  uh oh!  this summer is gonna rock!  well goodnight world.  sleep tight.
