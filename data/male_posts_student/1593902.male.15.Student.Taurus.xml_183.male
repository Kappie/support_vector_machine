I WILL find out where socks run off to when people do their laundry before I die; I shall do an investigative report. It would be cool if I can use one of those tracking devices the police use in movies and put it on a sock and then discover where the sock goes and then I picture it will lead me into this sub-world of SOCKS! and all the socks ever lost would be piled up in mounds like the gold in the caves of Aladdin and then I could play in the socks as if they were big heaps of leaves, which I've always wanted to do! Ahh...only in my dreams.  For now, I have a lonely, solitary sock. If anyone has seen him, let me know. He's big, long and white (lol...IT'S A SOCK PEOPLE, remember that) and she needs her mate!
