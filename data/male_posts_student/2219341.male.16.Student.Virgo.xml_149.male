Then we meet Stephen Tyler, the lead singer.  Then we tell him that I'm interested in his daughter, Liv Tyler (the hott elf from LOTR!).  and then when i do Stephen will say "RIGHT ON!" and then he'll pay for our plane tickets to go see her.  and when she sees me she'll be like "oh kristopher!" and I'll be like "yeah i think we should go out babe" and she'll be like "of course" and then I'll be like "hey babe we gotta hook tenea up with Orlando!" (Orlando Bloom).  and then Liv will be like "oh i have to call him tonight!  i've finally found the perfect person for him!"  and she'll call him and he'll be like "omgosh! i have to meet her!" and then Tenea will go fly to him and marry him and they'll live happily ever after!  as for kristopher...well he'll marry Liv Tyler and they're gonna live happily ever after.  and everynight Kelly Clarkson will sing songs to them cuz her voice is awesome and then Alicia Keys will play the piano and recite poetry cuz i love the way she talks and then Norah Jones will wake them up with her soothingly wonderful voice.  and life will be perfect.  WELL THATS THE PLAN!  isnt it great!  WELL OK I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA!  it made my day just a little better!
