Saturday I spent mostly transferring pictures from my camera to this computer here....I really got some great pictures....halfway through my boy Nile signed on and I sent him a few.....the pictures convinced him that he should head back up to Nashville sometime soon for a repeat of earlier this year....sounds good to me....then I headed out to a picnic at Centenial Park....it was an Alpha picnic, directly in front of Nashville's replica of the Parthenon (I found this to be very appropriate for some reason)....I had fun at the picnic and also had alot to drink....in a drunken rage I found myself blurting out the address to this site so my traffic should increase for a few days until they find out how boring I really am and see that I don't update all that often....maybe they'll start blogs of their own or become a Kel/OJ/Daana/Dani (if she ever comes back!)/Beth junkie like I am....  Anyway after the picnic we headed to Friday's to grab something to eat....our service was terrible, but the food was good....that's how it seems to go at Friday's on Elliston Place....the bright spot was me winning the trivia contest....I had to fight off this woman with a gold outfit and a matching gold hat....turns out she was like the point's leader at that particular location....I impressed her with my trivia knowledge....I was winning the next contest pretty solidly but my party was ready to head out....I had gotten the full amount of points on the first 5 questions and I looked like I was going to run away with it....but I ended up in 2nd place by the seventh question....the table in front of me was gunning for me and they were dissappointed with me leaving....I probably could have come back and won....but oh well....we'll never know...MAYBE I CAN CONVINCE ONE OF MY READERS TO GO BACK AND DO SOME TRIVIA WITH ME BEFORE SHE HEADS BACK TO ATLANTA (how is that for being subtle)....  I woke up this morning and Forrest Gump was on....I got a pleasant phone call, but it was at a crucial point in the movie....I have a confession....Forrest Gump now makes me cry several times during the course of the movie....then I was inspired to call my mother....she gave me some great words of wisdom as she is prone to do lately....and she helped me to see certain things in my life in a new light....we talked about quite a few things....I'm really blessed....I love my mother....  Don't know what I'm GOING to do today....I NEED to clean up but there is a fat chance of that happening....
