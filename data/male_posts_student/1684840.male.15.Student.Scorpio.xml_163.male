English was okay, we did another poem with a swear word it in hehehe    In Biology we just did a practice paper, how entertaining!  Geography was really cool.  Miss Taylor heard us talking about the trip to Alton Towers (Hopefully going next Friday wooooooooo!!) and shared a little story about how she took a disabled friend with her so they could both get on the rides instantly mwahah... she r0x0rs!    Games was brilliant again.  I'm glad I've started doing it again, and my asthma is nowhere to be seen yet, but I am not really doing any tough exercises really.  It would be hell if it were football I was doing at the moment - God forbid.  Craig whacked the ball and it either missed (luckily) or whacked Lauren in the foot.  It went about 70 Mph, at a guess.  We had an assessment in Maths and I think I did quite well actually *crosses fingers*    Can't wait to find out more about the Alton Towers package so we can book it etc.  It will be a bloody good day out and a great time to spend some time with me friends    Because I'm anti-sport, I'm wearing normal clothes on Friday and bringing in my Mufti money all in coppers    That should keep them busy for a while!
