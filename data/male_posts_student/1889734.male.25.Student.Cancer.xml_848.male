"How Sad...   ...that Ronald Reagan didn't die in prison, where he belonged for starting an illegal, laughably unjustifiable war against Grenada under false pretenses (the 'besieged' medical students later said they were nothing of the sort) and funneling arms to hostages during Iran-Contra.   Oh, and 9/11? That was his. Osama bin Laden and his fellow Afghan 'freedom fighters' got their funding, and nasty weapons, from Reagan.   A real piece of work, Reagan ruined the federal budget, trashed education, alienated our friends and allies and made us a laughing stock around the world.   Hmmmm...sounds familiar.   Anyway, I'm sure he's turning crispy brown right about now."
