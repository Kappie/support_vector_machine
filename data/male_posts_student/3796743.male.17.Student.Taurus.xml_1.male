I'll probably include politics and my beliefs which I find myself becoming more interested in by the day. So, if you don't enjoy my thoughts or beliefs than you should probably not read on...but I would hope that you would and not hate because I happen to have different beliefs than you. That has been my BIGGEST problem for about...oh i dunno...a year or more. The people I choose to surround myself with are mainly of a different background and have different beliefs. I am TOTALLY FINE with that. But these people are not. They think they can convert me and argue with me on a daily basis about how wrong my beliefs are. This is why I like this whole blog thing. I can spew my thoughts on topics without people telling me how wrong I am until after they read my entire arguement. So I encourage you...read the entire blog. You don't have to like it or think I am right (think I'm an ass for all I care) but I ask you to do one thing. RESPECT my opinions and beliefs as I respect yours. Don't call me names, or tell me I'm wrong without an arguement to back it up. Some may even find that I know more than I pretend to.  So to begin this blog...here's what I did today. NOTHING! Actually I got up early (10.30) and did nothing but eat. I met Alex downtown to hang out in some social establishments (namely the library and others...). Then as we were walking back (I had one of those bottled frappuccinos) I drank too much and it came out my nose. It was gross, I've never had anything come out my nose before...so that was super cool. heh. Then I came home and tanned for about an hour and a half and to my suprise I was still white when I got done....I'm getting sick of tanning and not getting tan...it may be time to go tanning California style. I love my life. (but I'll meddle on that in another blog...)  So here we go...hopefully I will find myself updating this blog daily this summer...I hope you all have a good night...  Later
