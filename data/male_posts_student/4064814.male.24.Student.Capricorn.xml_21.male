I was able to:      Take the pebbles from the shore and put them into the well to drop the bucket and retrieve the mask     Use the mask to scare the horse to break down the fence to reach the archery guy and say  Haldo!      Win the bow from the archery brothers and use it to slay the Kerrek    ... I just can't seem to get into the hut with no knob.  Oh well, back to work.
