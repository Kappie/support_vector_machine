    
       Congratulations, you've just all been part of a nice scheme that I played, in order to present tomorrow's Blogger tip!  We'll have 2 blogger tips tomorrow, since I didn't get to tonight's.  Things will be different tomorrow because we're starting new things.  Here's what to expect tomorrow:  Starting things off will be the video of the day, which is a strong bad email on Home Star Runner.  Then, we'll have the site of the day.  After that, a download.  And then, the two blogger tips that I'll have for you.  Part of the scheme was me changing the name, and I'm going to find out how I can change the URL if at all possible.  So, stick around, and we'll have everything fixed tomorrow.
