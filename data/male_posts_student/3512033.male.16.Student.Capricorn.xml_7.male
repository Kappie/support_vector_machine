"screw the fruit, eat chicken, it's good""    hehe... i think im starting to get the hang of this blogging code stuff... btw, i've finally made a links section, be sure to check them out... if u think you're site is worthy of being there, tell me, but i doubt that it is... hehe...  anyhoo, still no progress on the background... this is due to three reasons            1. I can't be stuffed           2. I don't know how to start           3. I can't be stuffed  you get the idea...   well, as you may have noticed, yesterday was the first day ever in the existence of my blog that i failed to make a post... get used to it... if you want to know why, view sections 1 and 3 in the list.   oh yeah, guess what... i still have an exam left :( stupid chemistry... and i haven't studied either (sections 1  3)   i dont really want to go back to school at the moment. Over the course of this entire weekend, i have achieved absolutely nothing of any importance... its been great :)  anyway... i think im going to fiddle around with the blog for a bit longer... i just took a look at my mate raven's blog, and quite frankly, im getting seriously owned...  so much catching up to do...
