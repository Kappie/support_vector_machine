D'OH! it took me 4 hours to take the engine apart and try to unscrew the elusive cap. i finally took the radiator apart from its holding area, but i needed a third hand to lift it and my other two to accomodate the twisting motion. of course, i only have two hands, so it did not work. it could have been a thirty minute job if my "friend" Tim the Toolman Taylor would have gotten off of his ass and helped me instead of staring at me...
