I cant wait until they catch Osama Bin laden. If you don't agree with me I would like to here about it. please add to my comment board.  Marines are dieing everyday to protect this country from another terrorist attack. Please pray for those that are still over there today.  This was sent to me by one of my close friends.  Being happy doesn't mean everything perfect. It means you've decided to see beyond the imperfections! SLEEP WELL LAST NIGHT? Bed a little lumpy... Toss and turn any... Wish the heat was higher... Maybe the a/c wasn't on... Had to go to the bathroom... Need a drink of water... ??? Yes... It is like that!Count your blessings, pray for them,Talk to your criterion next time when... the other car cuts you off and you must hit the brakes,or have to park a little further from Walmart than you want to be,or you're served slightly warm food at the restaurant,or you're sitting and cursing the traffic in front of you,or your shower runs out of hot water,Think of them... Protecting your freedom! Message from Iraq proud warriors of Baker Company wanted to do something to pay tribute To our fallen comrades. So since we are part of the only Marine Infantry Battalion left in Iraq the one way that we could think of doing that is By taking a picture of Baker Company saying the way we feel. It would be awesome if you could find a way to share this with our fellow countrymen. I'm wondering if there was any way to get this into your papers to let the world know that "WE HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN" and are proud to serve our country." Semper Fi (1SGT David jobe)
