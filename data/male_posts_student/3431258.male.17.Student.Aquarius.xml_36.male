Spoke by mail with the buyer. He was a bit afraid before bidding, but who would not?   Did'nt do anything special except that. I just realised that i play a lot less games than i did in my free time, now i just surf the web. Guess im just waiting for july, am i?   Spoke a bit with  Helder  about my problem, he supports me. It's a good thing to have people supporting you.   Owww i eated too much chocolate after diner.  Regards,  Zephyr
