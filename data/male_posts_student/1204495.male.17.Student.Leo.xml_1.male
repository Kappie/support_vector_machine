O yeah, my hand 'accidentally' clenched up into a fist in business studies and hit alex a 'couple' of times on his arm, such a watse of energy, i could of just thumped him in the face, and he would of shut up. Well i had a nice kip on the bus this mornin, i'll also explain another time, anyways must dash, its off to bed, ok to play on my ps2 or maybe sleep, i dunno which yet
