NO!! so today was really awesome. being the last day of school, i almost cried when i left the campus...this was by far the best year of my school career EVER. no doubt about it guys--this year, ive been more popular than ever, reached out more than ever, and done more than i can even begin to describe. i just cant believe it went by so fast..yet @ the same time, it didnt go fast enough, ya know what i mean? would i do it all over again? oh yes, for sure-in a heartbeat...you know, ive never had a year so good in school in my entire life, and thats no exaggeration. this is what ive been waiting for all of my life--a good year in school, with barely any drama @ all--and thats exactly what i got. though there were sometimes i just wanted to biotch slap some ppl, and i know that there was a few occasions where ppl wanted to biotch slap me...overall, it wasnt THAT bad....im really going to miss it, but ill never forget it. man, im getting all teary eyed up here. it feels like a new beginning for me. and something keeps telling me that not only are relationships going to work out, but that my senior year will be unforgettable. i cant wait to see whats in store for me, but i have to be patient....  but like i said--today was REALLY awesome! laura, sarah, tim and myself all went out for lunch, right? but, before this all occurred, we were leaving school with all of sarah's stuff from her locker (which was all laura's haha), and decided to walk to laura's from the school! so, as we're walking, we just get lazy and thank God Nicole is right there, and whitie (laura) hecka jacks a ride from her LoL!! so we get to laura's house, call up tim, and tell him to meet us @ the ice creamery @ like 1:20 (this was like the 5th time we changed the time) LoL!! laura needed some money, so she went and asked andy for the money she needed! andy didnt have it...THEN becka walks in the house, and tells andy that she needs the $5 dollars that andy owed her! omg--lemme just say that it went back and forth for like 5 minutes LoL!!! reminded me of my house though haha! so we get to the ice creamery, run into some ppl from school that we dont like, and wait for tim to come. when tim gets there, everyone ordered their food, and we ate....the funny thing was, i kept getting food ALL OVER MY BODY no matter what i did!! Noah: " i dont play with my food laura!!" Laura: (thinking)--is that what you call it?? LoL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so we leave the ice creamery, go back to laura's, then tim and i left to go and meet Mr. French--this teacher guy who, from what tim tells me, is like really cool! although i only got to talk to him for like 5 minutes, he seems really neat, and i hope to get to know him a lot better this summer (before he leaves for china). met some really cool ppl @ community christian (christian, jasmine, etc)!! luv you guys mucho!! then, we came to my house, and my mom just decides to take tim and i to dinner, so we did that and had a lot of fun (round table)! when we came home, tim and i checked out the new clothes online from A (both of our store now!!), then he had to head home, b/c he has to get up @ 4, for work tomorrow! then, i went to bible study, and talked to my aunt for like an hr about stuff...she's really cool--i love her to death...then, we played in the lovel's pool house for a while before we decided to go home. im home now and hecka bored...so, if you wanna talk, pls call me, b/c i have nothing to do! byebye!!!!
