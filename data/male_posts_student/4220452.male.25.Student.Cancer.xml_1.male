If one chances to see brilliant meteors slice the sky, win. If not, then one is underneath a canopy of heavens, another win. I invited a few friends, but not surprisingly, only myself was amazed. Well, myself and a talkative farm cat who never got close enough for me to see in the vast darkness.  This afternoon, I purchased my school books. This February, I am scheduled to graduate with a B.A. in Psychology. Nothing is going to stop me. Classes actually begin in a month, but I have already started studying. This is my seventh year. I am not going for an eighth. Unfortunately, I have taken all the classes that interested me already. So now, onto the boring classes. But as I was driving home, I was thinking to myself that I would do much better in classes if I enjoyed them. So I decided to make myself believe that I found Anatomy interesting. No luck there yet. But the interest for Physiological Psychology came easily. My textbook is written for people like me. It is full of “somehow”s, “we do not understand yet”s, “but perhaps there are”s, et cetera. I love a science that does not think it has already discovered everything.
