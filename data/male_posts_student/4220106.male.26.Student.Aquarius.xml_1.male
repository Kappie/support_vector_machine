I rode my bike there and the sidewalk was so bumpy, I forgot since I hadn't gone on that part for awhile.  I saw some cute girls by the Cross Country team, in shorts and cute as can be :)  I went inside and went to the Main Office to apply.  It was fun being back inside, missed my old high school and saw a few more cute girls along the way :)  I filled out the application and turned it in to the lady at the desk, asked her if they would be calling people, she said they would go through them and then decide who to call, didn't sound too hopeful but at least I gave it a shot unlike last year where I didn't.  I then took a walk around the school, saw the 2nd floor and went into the Arts wing too.  It was fun and I saw my old English teacher, Mrs. MacWorter who I liked having.  We talked some, she is real friendly and I enjoyed catching up on what was going on with each other since we saw each other last, years ago.   I left after that and headed back through Notre Dame and decided at the spur of the moment to stop at the library to use the Internet there, just to spend time away from home, despite having it in my bedroom, I get so tired of being home so much during this break between school.  I typed so fast that people seem to be annoyed by it when writing back to my e-pals in the e-mail but too bad, that's their problem, I'm not stopping nor am I ever.  I headed back home after being there for like 20 minutes or so.  I see then that the girl I wrote on Saturday too, gets all bitchy about me following her and saying I stalked her but I did not, its not what I did, it was to talk to her but she didn't wait, decides to get in her car instead so she's screwed up, stupid snob!  I get tired of them being like that to me.  So I was so depressed about that and cried later on about it.  It was not good and it messed up most of my day after that.  I was upset again in the evening and it was rather disturbing to think about her.  But I later recovered after chatting with Kasey and surfing the web to read different things so I was feeling better in the end.
