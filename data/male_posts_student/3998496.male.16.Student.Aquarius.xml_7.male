So I got pretty and then went to the bowling ally (stupid brother) and then to costco. I get home to see justin in my guest parking. So I hop in the truck and we ride to Chris's house. So we kick it then Justin calls alex. So alex is comming over and me and Justin jet to his house real quick. When I was done laying some fat riffs down on Justins guitar. We go back to Chris's house and kick it and wait fer ALEX. Well she never showed till after I left so go home. Im taking online when my moniter explodes. So now I am out a car and a computer. So that was today I hope tommorw is better. Yet knowing my luck it won't be.
