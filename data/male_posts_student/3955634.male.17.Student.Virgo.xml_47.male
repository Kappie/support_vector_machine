Alan Keyes, whose  urlLink hypocritical carpetbagging ,  urlLink ludicrous platform  and ultra-Christian  urlLink hatred for church-state independence  have defined him as nothing less than an extremist, thinks he stands a chance for the Senate seat in Illinois. It's going to be great watching  urlLink Barack Obama  take him to the hoop, and shatter the backboard while he's at it.  Best quote out there is him saying that if he wins, " urlLink the victory is for God ." I sure hope an interviewer asks what an Obama victory could be attributed to.  And on a completely unrelated note, maybe you're interested in reading about the Democratic Party's  urlLink anti-semitism problem . Huh?!
