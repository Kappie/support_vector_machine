I actually had a sip of Carlsberg from a bottle I was offered and in fact found that I wanted to drink the lot. The counselling session had the function of refreshing my ideas about why I became sXe in the first place.It also invovled reflection on why I felt the need to drink now. Being here, staying in a shitty youth hostel away from friends means that I do not have positive alternatives to the nihilstic resort to drugs. Except, as I realised, it was my guiding thought in becoming sXe that there were  always  positive alternatives. In this spirit we set off for the red light district, except that in fact I didn't really want to go there, but anyway I didn't drink the beer, so good. Earlier in the day I was so fucking close to having a cigarette. I'd managed to tell myself that I could smoke here and no-one need ever find out. The only thing that stopped me was that the lady I was going to blag a fag off of, Michela, only had one left in her pack, I saw, which meant that poolitness overcame my craving. So my edge remains essentially unbroken (I am satisfied that the sip of beer didn't count - I had one before a few months ago. I've had drags off cigarettes too actually, which is far worse. Still I consider this behaviour really fucking mild to the point of not really mattering in the general scheme of abstinence) due oinly to chance and not my strength of will. But whatever. Fuck, it's a close shave really, because I guess once you've had one cigarette the danger of having more is enormous, because once you've broken the edge you might as well just go crazy. This is the whole reason to be straight-edge: your edge is the only thing that stands between you and uncontrolled drug-use (because then the drugs and the highs and the cravings control your use). It's also why what Ray Cappo said in an interview I read is so important, that if someone breaks their edge, the last thing we should do is turn our backs on them, but rather try to help them, because otherwise they will never get back on the wagon.
