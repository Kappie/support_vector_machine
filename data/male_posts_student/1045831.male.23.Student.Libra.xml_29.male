He came back and didn't want his hair anymore and so I went over and borrowed Toms' clippers and bam he is almost bald.  It was fun.  BUt right now I gotta go jump in the shower and play some guitar before my lesson.  Then it is off to work..  Everyone have a happy Valentines Day and find someone to love and if you don't have one well you can always take turns loving me..  Go out and spread your seed loved ones.. I'm out..
