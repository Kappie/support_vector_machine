Although the two schools I wasn't really interested in, it was fun to go around and tour them.      I wasn't really impressed by Rider University.  It was just bland and the cost of tuition was too much for something thats not so awesome.  Its mainly a business school so sciences weren't the top priority.  I took two pictures there.  I wasn't interested at all.    College of NJ was better.  But not by much.  The campus was great.  The dorms were bigger.  But again, nothing really interesting.  I liked the study abroad program there.  But its not too big.      Meh, nothing interesting.    La Salle business is over.  Now, I'm just chilling.  Its getting really boring here since I have no one intelligent to talk to.  Matt hasn't e-mailed me back.  Sigh.  Other than that, I've just been e-mailing various people.  College e-mail-ing.  I have to e-mail biscombe and ask about her.  Um, I'm studying.  Yeah, I'm a dork.    I think next year is going to be really stressful for me.  Which is good because Junior year has been too easy.  I got my class rank and junk today.  14/430.   Good.  3.99 GPA.  Hopefully all my honors and AP classes will bring my GPA up.    Farewell.
