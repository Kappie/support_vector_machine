You see, I would define a computer game as 'an interactive piece of software developed for entertainment in which the user has control over something'. Now  Flight Simulator  seems to have been created as - unsurprisingly - a simulator, not for enjoyment. Its primary aim is to model real life like a military simulation or trainer, not as a game. Computer games are designed for fun, but is  Flight Simulator ? People get enjoyment out of it, but that doesn't qualify it as a game because it doesn't appear to be designed for that role. I'm not sure what I would do if I had to review it. What would I put for a gameplay score? "Uh, well, you can fly about and that's it. It's a fun as you want it to be to a certain extent."   Microsoft, who make it, seem to think that it's a game as their URL points out: microsoft.com/games/flightsimulator/, but are they kidding themselves? The product outline doesn't seem like that of a game!   *Dynamic weather system based on realistic atmospheric physics, with true three-dimensional clouds that form and dissipate, and automatic real-world weather updates when you're connected to the Internet.  *Weather “themes” that generate a wide variety of stunning—and challenging—flying conditions with just a few clicks of a mouse  *Enhanced interactive air traffic control (ATC), including traffic at all airports around the world (including non-towered airports), altitude changes en route, pop-up IFR clearances, and precision and non-precision approaches to multiple runways  *Interactive 3D “virtual” cockpits—tune radios and operate key aircraft controls and avionics by pointing and clicking in the virtual cockpit view.  *Scenery improvements, including taxiway and runway signs, enhanced auto-gen 3D objects, more high-detail airports, and improved lighting and sky effects  *Garmin 500 and 295 series GPS with color moving maps and airport/facility information  *Improved full-color map view with terrain display  *Improved support for 3D graphics hardware acceleration in multiple windows and across multiple monitors  *Learning Center--a “Web site on the disc” available while the simulation is running that includes a Key *Topics visual guide to the features in Microsoft Flight Simulator, direct links to flights and lessons, flight briefings, how-to procedures, aircraft handbooks, and more.  *New and expanded lessons and ground school topics  *Kiosk mode for unattended demonstrations    Sounds like a simulator with no added fun to me - "Kiosk mode for unattended demonstrations"?? That will be fun!  Well rant over, I'm tired and I'm off to bed.
