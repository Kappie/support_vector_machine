I changed the link, so Black Ghost Staff indeed goes to the new URL :) I'll alos work on a small logo hopefully less than 500k, to stick in front of projects, and such like. I alsogave Beckett admin access like everyone else. I sent beckett an lengthy email describling several topics we were discussing, and everything looks well. So i'm happy :)  Han's doing work on his articles, Becketts working on the site, I'm working on my flash, and james on his (which is quite a bonus) All I can say is good good good :)  Hopefully something will become of this, but theres a 99% chance of everything becoming like Hiroshima '45, ie: everything F$%ked up. As long as people are prepared to work, I think It will become the 1% chance of a success. Maybe I should be less optimisitc and look at the defination of ghostanomics:  [2] miserable failure...          Jamie   ,  urlLink Black Ghost Staff
