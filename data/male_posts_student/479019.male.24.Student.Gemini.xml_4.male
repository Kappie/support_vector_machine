Which was cool. Today I managed to write some emails to some old friends, pick up some new shirts... one of which is a Big Wig shirt... woohoo! In addition to working and working out. I feel relatively energized. I feel like going out and downing some brews with some boys but there aren't any around. That's kind of a bummer. Where are some fellow alcoholics when you need them?  On my to do list tomorrow is work, try to get Bad Religion tickets, meet up with a group partner for my sociology project, and maybe call up some friends to hang out. Life is getting ever better!  ***
