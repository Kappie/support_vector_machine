Because there are some ugly rumors floating around about my statements on his commenting system and I need to clear this nasty matter up before a random person jumps at my throat. I did not write such, whatever was written that apparently many people have read, and I need to find the damn network to see who did such, and who is pinning one-half of the blame on me.  Fucking assholes. Commenting is for creative criticism, not for slander and crass insults. Screw you if you did such. Morons. My apologies, Chris, for whoever did that.
