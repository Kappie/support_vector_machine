The announcement comes after rumors that Kerry may not accept the nomination at the nominating convention surfaced.  Kerry will accept his nomination in a two-hour speech to the delegates, some of whom are already practicing their boredom-management skills. "I tape Kerry's speeches regularly," said one prospective delegate, "because they help me sleep and it's a lot cheaper than the medicine." Kerry's speech will focus on Iraq, the economy, and whatever "letting America be American again" is. All delegates will be supplied with free caffeinated drinks.
