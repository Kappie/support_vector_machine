It started out pretty good, waking at 10:30 and then being a lazy Tyke in bed for about half an hour.  Then he got up and took a nice, long, warm, chlorinated (stupid Sammamish Water people) shower.  In the midst of his drying off his naked body he heard the incessant ring of the telephone in the other room.  Although he was not clothed at all he dashed out into the rec room in full view of the window and picked up the phone.  He managed to drag the towel with him though and covered up his most intimate of locales while pushing the talk button in the middle of the 4th ring.  It was quite an accomplishment really.  To no surprise it was Macaroon on the other end.  The two decided they would hang out for the day.  A good choice seeing as Saturday Tyke sat around his house by himself so he really needed to get out and just do something.  So at 1 Tyke went over to Macaroon's where K-Caj already was.  They played around and waited for Dr. Phil to come over.  The 4 of them started up some Halo and then a little later Amed came over and joined in on the action.  It was a grand old time.  However, they got the hankering for some chow.  They all piled in the Shitmobile...er, Shevmobile and meandered on down Forest Drive to Factoria.  They went over to Red Robin and got some chow.  After they got the checks they noticed that the waiter/server/whatever they are called these days had managed to forget to include an order of fries, a drink, and had marked Tyke's "Freckled Lemonade" as a regular drink.  What a nice guy!  Or maybe he was just an idiot.  Tyke is leaning more towards the second one.  But while at Red Robin Tyke saw Dotti's entire family.  Minus Dotti that is.  She was at home working on school work or something along those unfortunate lines.  After food the guys trekked over to BIG 5 and then back to the car.  They went back to Macaroon's and they all got in their own cars and headed up to Cougar Ridge for a basketball affair.  The gang played some 21 and Tyke was just on fire.  He got tipped repeatedly and literally ended up scoring 60+ points in that one game.  He finally won though as Amed just couldn't handle Tyke's tremendous talent.  They played a game of HORSE and Tyke won.  They played bounce 21 and Tyke won.  They played another game of 21 and Tyke won.  Yeah, a good day.  Tyke is really feeling his game now.  He has drastically improved since his first real game of the year against the Sly Lioners.  Speaking of them...oh wait, you would probably have already read Monday's blog but if not you will read about that later.  Well Tyke is really good at hitting his free throws now too.  Like about 90%.  That is really good.  He just feels it every time.  After it was just Tyke, Amed, and Macaroon, the gang decided to take on these three guys that had rudely taken the other end of the court from them.  Tyke's crew flat out owned on those bastards.  They got schooled.  Pwned.  l337 h4x0rd.  Oh yeah, they were 11 years old.  And one kid was probably like 7.  But he was a ferocious little feline.  He was hounding Tyke when he had the ball.  Tyke would just dribble circles around him or bounce the ball over his head.  Tyke knocked him over a couple times cuz the kid kept running into Tyke's man-bod.  The kid got revenge though by slobbering all over Tyke's hand and getting full on grabbing of both Tyke's ass cheeks on one play.  Kind of a weird kid.  Very similar to Amed though.  Anyway, after the game Tyke went home and just hung out.  But he did get to talk to Haras in the day as they chatted in the morning about normal subjects (Tyke doesn't remember now as it was over a day ago).  He got to text Dotti a couple of times and kinda see her cuz he saw her family which is almost like seeing her.  And he talked to Purdy online at night and she was even in a talkative mood so that was great.  They talked about their youths a little bit and how Tyke used to perform dances when his relatives came over.  This one time he took off his Portland Trail Blazers hat and threw it into the crowd as his big finale and it drilled his aunt right in the face.  She wasn't that hurt though so it wasn't too bad.  Ok, well time to write Monday's blog.
