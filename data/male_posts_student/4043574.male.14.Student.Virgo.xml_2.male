We had 2 hours to kill before the movie started so we went to the dollar store. It was just about to close, since it was 9pm. We were talking about Jordan, and on our way out, saw some glass flowers. We decided to get a couple for her. Then we thought we needed a card too, so we ran over to K-mart and bought one. Then we saw the movie...which was hillarious. After that Jerry called his mom and she picked us up...( we were to lazy to ride ) When we got back to Jerry's house it was like 1 in the morning so we "went to sleep". When we knew his parents were asleep, we snuck out the back and walked down to Jordans house. It was about 2 when we got there. Then we put the flowers and card on the porch. We walked back to his house and got there at 2:30. Then we watched tv for a bit and went to sleep sometime before 4am.   We got up at like 10 and cleaned up Jerrys room for an hour. Then while i was messin around on his base, the sneeky bastard got on AIM and asked Jordan out! Right away he yells for me to get down there, and i read the chat....she said yes!  We spent the rest of the day tryin to meet up with Jordan, and finally got to at 5:20 for like 5 mins.  Wow...Jerry is so lucky. He beat me to it.
