Even amongst friends and the such, I just don't fit in...I really don't kare though, which is part of the reason I don't fit in: I just don't care.  Almost all of my friends have different view points on many things...well...different then my views.    I dunno.  I will expand on this topic later...but for now I have to go hang out at Glen Park Peace Out!  Spense
