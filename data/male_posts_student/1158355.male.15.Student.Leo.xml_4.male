On the bus Pat threw like 3 quarters and dimes at me so I chucked them full speed back and it ricochets off of the windows and awesome hit Kayla K and Laura C in the head. I would of gotten a double head shot! SCORE 2-0! Ok, so I get off the bus and drop my backpack and slide across the snow because its all hard and solid. For like 20 minutes I was doing it and people passing by must of thought I had some crazy disease. They see a small boy with a huge fluffy black jacket jumping on his stomach like a penguin and SLIDING AWAY! Then, I finished my homework quickly and basically played drums the rest of the day. After dinner, I went online to find out there's these clubs... Black Hawk Down and White Hawk Up? So I'm all confused and all these different people are like BE BLACK, BE WHITE, BE PINK, BE MACARONI ORANGE! And I'm like shizzle that, I'm making my own group with Keith Barbara Buckheit. Ok, that group just didn't work out so... screw these things. If I wanted I can corrupt the whole school and brainwash you all to bow down to me and the flying squirrels. Ya that's right Tommy Goo is your dictator. So... what's this group stuff for anyways? Popularity? Women? Food? Whatever it is, I know I'm out for good because once you get involved, it's like drinking Snapple's Kiwi Strawberry, one sip... nah you gotta have the whole thing! And I ain't taking responsibility for the fall of the Macaroni Orange Hawk Downs!
