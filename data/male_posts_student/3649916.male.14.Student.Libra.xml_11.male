Well today i did nothing at all with my friends all i did was argue with some dumb girl on msn and talk to some other hot one haha.  I also made a tailor in UO he is just about at 110 tailoring so i am satisfied with him.  I did not continue macro mining though i have 25k iron wow!  I cannot wait for my day tomorrow i probably will actually goto the river as long as the weather gets better, it has been cloudy as hell lately, wow i just realized my teacher is right, at the beginning of the summer the weather is really crappy haha.  Well i either am going on a 10 day trip to las vegas and california or going on a 7 day trip to mexico.  I would prefer mexico because i can tell management i am 18 and then DRINK ALL I WANT!!!!!!!!  hehehe i will be pissed every night but i will make sure to control it so i dont get to the point of no return...this is as long as we actually end up going on this trip hehe.  Well i cannot wait to goto bed so talk to you later  Chris
