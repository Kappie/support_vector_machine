Especially when one is a guy.  That's just my major weird experience of the day. If the constitutional amendment banning gay marraiges manages to pass, I'm going to stage a coup and overthrow the government. We need more LN people on this blog.  I move to invite Tyler Rudd or Paul Simmons.  Somehow this has turned into an LC blog with a couple of LN guys and that's not what it was supposed to be at all.  It makes me feel left out sometimes.  I also think you guys are being a little hypocritical in discussing LC teachers who Jonah and I have never met. No on Syndication. One: why do we want readers?  Two: Who would want to read any of this?  I think syndication is vain and pointless. I'm really sick of my title scheme, so as soon as I think of a good one I'm going to change it.  Just a bit of warning. Ok, none of that had anything to do with the rest of it, but thats ok.  Please don't get offended and try to start a flame war.  Stop Kemps, We're Playing Euchre!
