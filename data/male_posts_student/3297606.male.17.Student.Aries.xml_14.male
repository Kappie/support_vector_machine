He was one of the weirdest people i have ever met... he was either gay and retarded or just so retarded that he seemed gay... and thats not an insult, that just the way he came across. i couldnt really describe him to you, you would have to meet him yourself... so go to Elichers on main st and ask for Thomas, and tell him to tell you a story. Then you will know what i mean.  His weirdness gave me comfort though, in some weird way. Once i knew that i had no need to have an ego whatsoever, i loosened up. If it was some hardcore surfer guy i would probably have been trying not to come across stupid or somthing stupid and self concious like that. Because hardcore surfer guys take the lives of people that come across stupid, especially ones that go driving with them. shtick.  My brother came to school at lunch today, that was pretty cool. we all just knida talked about our next movie were making and he finished the logo for "Three Road Productions." it looks good to the max. The only problem at lunch today was the whole red ball issue, and that also contunued until after school. Jon Hansen got pwned by mr. dihn, who is the most power trippin person youll ever meet. so me mike and jon decided that he needed to be dealt with... so...  tomorrow between 5th and 6th period, we are going to massacre him. we ask all those who wish to participate to meet on the upper level of the east wing, and bring a hatchet. he shouldnt put up too much of a fight, but he does know viet naked, so we still need to use caution.  free time comes far and few between now. i barley have time to write this, hence the reason the first post was in my history class... but today i actually had a good amount of free time. trillian just freaked out so i need to go fix it. peace...  current best band ever: AFI current chip weight: 43g
