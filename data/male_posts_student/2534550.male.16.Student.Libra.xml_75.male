I went into it with a wierd attitude, i was happy to be going but not excited but when i finally got thier it was so fun. I didnt see not one frowning face in our group and anyone that had a negative attitude going into it was completly changed by the end of the second day. I mean the people, the attitudes, the ocean, the weather all worked toward a truly wonderful trip i dont think id change anything about it except the second floor meetings every 2 seconds.  On a sadder note i had to come back and get thrown into everything right away. My mom had to have her surgery yesterday and i went to see her today. I wanted to cry but i didnt because i didnt want her to worry about anything more then she needed to. But thier where tubes everywhere and all these doctors kept coming in because she was in ICU (a part of the hospital where ur in a room where ur constantly monitored by nurses and stuff i believe its intensive care unit or something). It was just a hard thing to come back to first thing.   My grandma is having her breast cancer surgery on fri to get her cancer removed. I dont know it seemed like before i left everything was all right but now its all happening so fast and just the thought of living without my mother and grandmother brings me to tears. but in Hawaii i didnt have to think about it. Again money is tight and it just sucks but im working again and that seems to be relieving a bit of stress and not causing more oddly enough. But i think everything will be alright i hope BD understands how things are and just take a note that if ur one of the people that call me rich and think i have no problems know whats going on in my life before u say anything because im liable to go off at anymoment.   But its all good because for some reason singing that song puts me back in Hawaii with no care in the world so ill just keep on singing it and be alright.
