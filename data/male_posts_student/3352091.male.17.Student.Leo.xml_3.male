SUmmer finally here, my last summer with my high school friends. Statistics say that you never keep in touch with even three quarters of your graduating class, my only hope is to find some friends such as the more recent ones ive made in my last few days of high school. Well I'll enjoy the summer, but i cant wait for college life, new people and places, and its odd that life gives you 4 opportunities to create a reputation for yourself, the self you create at the beginning of your school career, the one u have in high school, the one you get in college, and finally the one when you start your journey in the real world. I really like the person I've become, with an exception of some bad habits but I dont think there is one person who doesnt have them. I dont wish to recreate myself, I only wish for people's view of who i  am to be positive. More than anything in the world i wish to stay true to myself and not change to adapt to new surroundings but to change because my tastes and perspectives have changed.             "We Know who we are, but we know not who we may be"                                                  -Shakespeare    Oh yea I saw one of my college friends last night for the first time since tenth grade i believe. She looks pretty and im going to the same college as her sooo.... hey new place new situations lol hope i make the best of them
