I told you all about me, and how stuff around me is going, but I haven't told you anything about my plans for the rest of the summer. Aside from working, I am hoping to get my own Xbox, and stop borrowing my friend Alyce's. She is gonna want it back pretty soon, so I need to get my own. My girlfriend, Jessica, is trying to help me, but her mom is too mean to let her. She's gonna be moving pretty soon, and we still don't know where she's gonna be. Well, since that about wraps things up, I'll let you all get back to your daily lives, however dull they might be.
