The new design is mostly pale orange/yellow/white colours and is tabular in appearence (it's square).  The first news post on my website is....   "In the beginning the Universe was created.  This has made a lot of people very angry and has since been widely regarded as a bad move. " - Douglas Adams    "And, following on in that grand tradition, I have made a new website. Ok, it doesn't quite compare to God's stuff, but i'm pretty chuffed with it. "
