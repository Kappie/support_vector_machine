The patterns kinda repeat, and its based on the A pentatonic, but for one, this is definitely not the usual pentatonic stuff. I've recently been in the guitar playing mood. Anyway, went to the library today, as this being a school holiday, it was damn crowded, I saw Sai lam there too. Well, decided to go there and read, especially maths. One thing is that I can't understand most physics texts as most of them are all maths stuff. So, well, i've decided to take up maths for the sake of physics though.  Those guys at physicsforum said that a good place to start would be linear algebra and differential equations. And I've borrowed books which actually introduced these topics, so far so good i can say, even though linear algebra has alot of matrices, and I suck at matrices lol. As well as vectors. Differential equations are basically just differential equations, and DE is a tad more difficult that linear algebra, I haven't gotten into DE yet, but I can somewhat see that by skimming through the introduction.  Also got a book about beginning quantum physics, for people who are new to it, without the maths parts, introduces theories such as strings, super-symmetry and the like. And there's many questions in my head though,and many things to clarify. I've also gotten a book on introductory relativity. there's a little maths in there, but it doesn't look to advanced. I think its good if I know a little bit about relativity, and so far, I haven't really understood anything about relativity yet. Imo, relativity is by far the most confusing aspect of physics aside from quantum theory. They're actually not difficult, but just confusing.  Quantum theory and relativity are at odds with each other. and so far, I don't think I would really need to know about relativity as those are in the realms of cosmologists and astrophysicists, focuses on the large scale stuff. Quantum physics is what I'm interested in, and there's hardly any relativity involved (i think...). Hmmm, but the maths is what I'll focus on now. Right now, stuff like sociology and philosophy has become more leisure reading lol. And I think its good, sometimes when I'm tired with the physics or maths sections in the library, I'll go read about philosophy and stuff, helps relax my mind.  My saturday evenings are now spend almost entirely in the library, and when it closes at 9, I'll go somewhere to read. Its good, like i said, I feel that I'm in a place which belongs to me on a weekend, and not a church. Well, I've got nothing against christianity though, and still consider myself a christian. But hmmmmm, heard from Amanda that Aussie churches are not bad, kinda suit me, open to discussion and stuff. But I've got one thing against huge churches though, it feels abit too corporatized already, like I'm attending a board meeting every week. Feels abit, plastic, abit.......Britney Spears, y'noe?  Anyway, that aside, I find that time spent in the library has so far been really fruitful. And I can say that now, my life is looking up..........whoo. But I worry though, that if I do so much of such stuff, how will my O levels look like?? I really dunnoe, but I feel the need to really perform in the O'levels. To show my parents that I know what I'm doing and let me plot my own path in my education, and I think that's really important to me, to learn the things which I want to learn.
