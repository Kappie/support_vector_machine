The blondes name is Shannon, a friend of Erins, she is 19. I want a stable, healthy  committed relationship, I get a one night stand instead.  I'm heading west in a few hours to see my family and buy a new car. My arrival time is set for Friday if I drive the route that's planned. There is an amazing woman I want to see. I owe her an apology and it has to be done in person.
