My body doesn't do it. I can run in football, or if I'm getting chased, but that's different. I guess I am just going to have to work a little harder at football. It's all good though, we are going to have an awesome season, you wait and see. I feel confident in the coaching staff and our players, we may not have a lot of people practicing, but the people we do have, want to be there, and they want to win. We are killing in passing scrimages, and the line is already better than it was last year, and we haven't even put pads on yet.    We're going to rock. Be prepared for more than a 10 week football season.       "Winning is important to me, but what brings me real joy is the experience of being fully engaged in whatever I'm doing."
