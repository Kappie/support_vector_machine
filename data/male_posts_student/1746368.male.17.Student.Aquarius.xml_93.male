Concert:: Blech  Sydney:: Australia  Shower:: Curtain  Patterns:: ABC ABC ABC ABC  Market:: Bazaar  Chair:: Sit  London:: France (I don't know, it was the first word.  Reception:: Table  Republican:: Democrat  Cough:: Hack   Let's see, I can't really remember much from Wednesday. At youth group we had a game night, and that would have been cool if it wasn't so loud. They had a mind game, and I was my team's representative. Whenever I answered I got it right, and I answered a majority of the questions before the person ended the question. It was pretty fun.   On Thursday I went to go meet Dominique and Sam for lunch. Those two are some pretty strange people. I believe I got hit with a straw wrapper two or three times. We always go to Taco Bell, even though I don't eat anything there. That night I had school and as usual, that was boring.  On Friday (A day) I pretty much had two free periods in a row. In TA we didn't do anything, as usual. In Web Page design I was excused from the assignment because it was a topic that I didn't want to discuss (internet censorship, and specifically adult entertainment sites). She let me go to the Mac Lab and help the teacher there out (my TA teacher). Interestingly enough, she didn't have anything for anybody to do, so I didn't do anything. I read and finished my book.  Friday night there was a dance. Sadie Hawkins dance in fact. I am sure most of you people know what the whole difference between Sadie's and some other dance is, but to take up space and your time, I will elaborate. At a normal dance,  usually  the guy asks the girl. For some odd reason, these kind of dances, the girls are supposed to ask the guys out. Whatever, doesn't really matter to me, Dominique and I both agreed to go since a few friends of ours were going. It was a fun dance, but we left kind of early and were freezing our butts off! In our district, once you leave a dance, you are not allowed to go back. Whatever.   Saturday. Ahh, Saturday was fun. I didn't even get out of my pajamas. I worked on a Biology project and then I played games all day. I wouldn't mind doing that every day. I talked with Dominique on the phone a lot too. My dad had left Friday for the Men's retreat at our church, so it was just my mom and me for the most part. Chris was there, but he was just being his, now normal, wacky self.  Today has been going fairly well. I woke up about a hundred times last night, for lots of reasons. I slept in the living room, just because I could. I fell asleep reading, and that was okay with me. I woke up and played a little  urlLink Mario  Luigi . Then I got ready for church and walked over there. Dominique passed me up while I was walking, they didn't even bother to stop (of course, I am just kidding, I was like less than a minute away). Our youth pastor, Pastor Mike, announced the missions trip our group is taking this year. We are flying to Belize, a country in Central America, down by the Bahamas. I found it funny that he had something prepared but we got him on the subject of the trip. We just had a time of fellowship and asked him questions about it. It's funny how we sometimes forget that even if we have something planned, God doesn't always think it is necessary. Anyways, after Sunday school I needed to set up the special needs class for my brother. We did that and went inside to the normal service. It was pretty cool, the sermon was about giving thanks continuously, instead of just at Thanksgiving. Then afterwards they had a little basket giveaway. There were like 10 baskets set up with different sorts of prizes. Dominique entered my name into one of them, and since she did that, I entered her name into one she really wanted. Neither of us won, but that's okay. The money went to the Women's Ministry. Then Rachel (Dominique's mom) took me home. We talked for a little while and then I went inside.  Sorry, I was rambling. I guess I don't notice it with myself or anybody. I figured it doesn't matter if I do here, I am not making you guys read this. Well, I have some twinkies to deep fry, you may go..........now!
