This damned blog has turned me into some fucking thirteen-year-old goth chick. Things shall change!  In fact, I'm going to start writing like a gossip columnist! ITEM! I have just returned from a trip to Yale University, which, despite efforts to assure me that was the least Yale of all weekends to come, is like a giant KU Honors program. I don't know if that is a bad thing, just merely an observation. Hmm...yep. Thats all I really have to say about Yale, other than it was a fun, interesting (if not enlightening) trip. If you want a deatiled itinerary of a college trip, I suggest to visit  urlLink sam . Oh, and whichever of Gail's Stalkers who read this - first, do not Kung Fu Dance in front of an open window, it don't look cool. Second - Gail got grinded and lapdances from her three fairly attractive and talented roomate/suitemates/girls from across the hall. Go stroke it to that.   Oh ye gods in the heavens above I am vulgar! Mine caustic tongue is not meant for the serenity of the masses, only to spite them into roaring frenzy! Not self indulgent enough am I to post poetry ( for than I would have to write it) but merely to continue the constant dictation that flows throughout that brilliant vessel that forms the heart - scratch that - brain of Tyson! Some may simply call this stream of conciousness writing, but I tell them that if you would dare to compare me to the likes of Joyce than obviously something is wrong with you - c'mon, Joyce doesn't nearly compare to me quality wise! A fie upon thee who is not me! Hah! I like that - I hereby declare that unofficially and without any basis in fact my senior quote!   Whew - I need to calm down from an adrenalin high, especially considering the rough spot my life has reached. Its the usual story - commiment to play was more than I expected, the weight of homework threatens to crush my spine, ect, ect. But I shall not focus on that! In fact, lets look at the good in my life. HOLY CRAP! I just asked this cool girl to prom at the end of my latest 'vote-for-me' speeches (in a decision to put those horrible things to good use for once) and she not only said yes, but her parents did too. Parents, you ask? Why should they be involved? Well, dear readers, this sweet girl is merely a sophomore, and thus not a typical prom attendee. Some may accuse me of robbing the cradle, but I think of it more as robbing the braintrust - somewhere in the dark empyrean that forms this quaint experiment called existence, a supermassive (certainly class O) stellar object shone brilliantly, because there ain't nothing that can keep up with her. I'm simply happy I don't have to compete with her in college admissions - my grade is tough enough. Despite the predictions that this was just another stupid leap I took without thinking it through, I'm confident that Prom shall go well - because if it doesn't, a specific Buck will gore me until nothing corporeal remains. I only use that modifier because I'm certain after recent deoderant experiments something mephitic will remain.  I finally won an election - go me! Its not the one I wanted, desired, dreamt of, had any motivation to perform - but if you saw who else was running for it you would know I would have had to run. I will now be the Representative to the Board of Education of the Board of Trustees next year. I'm going to see just how much I can toy with these abominably rich and powerul rulers of our school without getting burnt. But something even more important happened on the student goverment front - my victorious oppisition for President made his first announcements today in assembly - and you know what? To put it bluntly, he sucks. To put it flowerily, his words were a malodorous miasma the punctured the eardrums of his uncouncious audience, like the cries of some small child trapped down a well desperately wailing for help in hopes that she might not die, but failing because she is ugly. Hmm, that wasn't that flowerily. Oh well, me and my self-loathing tells me that ugly people suck. Hah! Self effacing humor indeed!   His failures have encouraged me in one regard - that I still have a chance to win the hearts and minds of the people! I shall be the Mao Tse-Tung to his Jiang Jesei, and once his corruption and failures have caught up with him, I shall crush him and his Guondimang like a bug under the flyswatter of the people! I have already taken the first steps on my Long March, and becomed purged of my weakeness by the cleansing flame of pain. I cannot intitiate a revolution, but I can ressurect an old idea - the Historical Society, not in the new form of the Education Society. Verily I must educate the masses of their ignorance, and keep a weekly newsletter to constantly remind them of the mistake of their decision through its own genius. Stupidly arrogant you say? I wouldn't have it any way. I must go for now, but I also have big plans for this blog - a veritable fountain as copied and pasted information which I just decided is a new idea that no one has done before - so hah! I'm off, and I'm manic!
