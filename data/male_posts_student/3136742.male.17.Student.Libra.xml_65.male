George still has my $100, but that doesn't matter because George is going to get fired if he doesn't fix my computer for free.  Right now I feel like that duck... in the cartoon... hitting the computer with a mallet. Why?--  [geek speak] ok. So I've grown up a mac guy. For reasons I don't feel like discussing now (which actually make for one  fucked up  story), I've come into possession of two PowerMac G3 clones, a blue iMac, an Apple Mac G3 with a G4 processor, about 10 keyboards, and about 15 monitors (about 6 of which I threw out). These computers were top of the line back around 1996. They were beasts, maxing out at about 500Mhz, some having 24x CD-RAMs, and even one DVD-RAM (which was too old to play DVD movies, only used for massive storage).... For you window users who may not know; Macs can only be updated so much. After about 5 years Apple makes so many advances that they stop making new hardware and software for their older computers and they only focus on the newer groundbreaking models. These computers are almost 10 years old now. Anything that can be done to keep them in working shape has already been done. In an attempt to stretch a year or two more out of them I tried updating the software a little... Bad Idea... Apparently, mac clones don't like being updated and now both of the clones lost their systems-- they're completely useless now, and not worth the money to get someone who knows more about clones to install a system on them. I'd like to fiddle with the hardware but my dad is paranoid that I'll *break the computers that don't work and we didn't pay for or put any money into*... I'm stuck with a strawberry (pink... motherfuckers) iMac til I can afford a laptop...   and how the fuck is it already 9pm?!  I gotta think of something interesting to write
