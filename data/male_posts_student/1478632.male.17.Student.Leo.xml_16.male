Believe it or not, I actually have a job and after work, I go to my new house to work on it. Fun Fun Fun. Sadly, I haven't even had time for girls, like my friend Bonsai on  urlLink DisInt . He seems to be having a little trouble with his lady-friend, but I hope it works out well for him. Seriously. Hey shut up! What's up with this world...no one ever believes a sincere comment because of all the negative and sarcastic remarks that get thrown around. Sheesh. Anyway. NS 2.0 comes out July 31. (*Is excited*) Back to work...I work at a summer camp and we go around the state to swim and play around in all the state parks on monday, tuesday, thursday, and friday. On wednesday, we go somewhere special, like a museum or roller skating. I've met a bunch of people and reunited with a couple old friends (all counselors), and I'm afraid that one little girl "likes" me too much. I'm not lying...she follows me around and trys to show off to me and she's just weird around me. Ok off of that... I'm still sad that I haven't even  talked  to a girl my age (out of work and offline) for about a month now. *Sighs* I'm hoping to hook up with my friends and go to Hooters (Fa'Tony...ahem!) but to no avail, as my mom has been in the hospital twice in the past three weeks, and is there as I write this post. Back to girls. I  really really really  wish I knew one who liked me on more than a friendship or professional level. I think I'm compatable, at least, but all the girls just act like I'm the nice guy they's just like to "be friends" with. *Sighs twice* I'll never understand girls, but then again...who will? *Sighs again for good measure* I don't have much else to say tonight, so if you wanna talk to me, my contact info is on the side, and my AIM is wolfhoundNH. Bye  --Clash
