You may have had plans or wanted to do something else, but if the woman you love is tired - let her sleep. You can always do things at another time/day. Even if they get cancelled all together, what's the big deal? Isn't her comfort (and happiness) more important? She'll be less grouchy, more rested, more energetic, and more delighted to be with you. A well rested woman is a very happy date.
