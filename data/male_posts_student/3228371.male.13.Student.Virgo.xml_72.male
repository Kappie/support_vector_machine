The stuff that I didn't want to get to me, got to me. So blah. Whatever. Volleyball tonight. Fuck, I don't get to go anymore. I miss volleyball.   Nima had a lot of nose bleeds at school today. I hope it's nothing serious. I'm just really worried about him. My mom says it might be from being too tired, eating too much junk food, or sleeping too late or whatever. *sighzZ*   I had to go to Maxine yesterday to try on the grad dress I ordered and they had to make variations to my dress 'cos it wasn't a "perfect fit". The shoes I wanted were $125! Holy fuck, dude! I'm only wearing them for that one night though! I can't wear it to school...! There isn't anybody in my family that is getting married anytime soon so yeah... Girls have to spend SO MUCH on grad and guys just spend a little. I spent at least $400 on my dresses. I bought the first one (baby blue) for $170 something but didn't like it so bought a new one (beige) for $200 something. With the old one, I bought earrings and a necklace for it too and those were at least $40 in total. Now, I'll have to get shoes which will probably cost around $100 and I'll need to get a new set of earrings, a necklace, and possibly a bracelet to go with my new beige dress. I'll also need to spend at least $100 on setting my hair, make up I can handle myself, but I need a pedicure and manicure too! So basically, it'd be at least $600 for grad!   Oh my gosh... I'm also going to Markville this Saturday to go shop for a nice top for my Sudbury semi-formal dance! I have a skirt but I need a top! I'm also looking for some nice spaghetti strap tops too! Phew~! A lot of money spent this year! $200 for my green guitar, $100 for the bag, at least $600 for grad, and I don't know how much for Saturday! Crazyness!  Had some ice-cream today after school and also an ice-cream sandwich. Yum... talking to Candace on MSN right now. Hmm, I should probably get going for guitar class. *groans*   Whatever. I just hope Nima's okay. I wonder if he really went to see the doc. I hope he did... some beating from Octi could really put a guy in the hospital if it was serious.   Time to get my ass across the street for guitar lessons. So fuckin hot outside... phew... Oh well... guess what people?   ONLY 2 MONTHS AND 6 DAYS UNTIL MY BIRTHDAY!    ONLY 3 MONTHS AND 13 DAYS UNTIL NIMA'S BIRTHDAY!
