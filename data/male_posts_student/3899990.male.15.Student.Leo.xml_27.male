We did some main introductions about the class and about the teacher. Some "get to know each other" activities tomorrow!   1st Hour: English II (McCauley) -  Again, just some main introductions about the class. In addition, there were 44 of us in the class so it was very crowded. We did some introductions about each other and that was it.   2nd Hour: World Studies (Strong) -  We discussed some rules from the student handbook, dress code, and all that. Then, we discussed these questions: "What is history?" and "Why is history important?" for the remainder of the class. Since 1st and 2nd hour is a block, it felt like the class was too long.   3rd Hour: Lab Biology (Capps) -  This was probably the easiest class. All he did was introduce us to the class and the class rules. After that, we just got to chill and play around with some brainteasers for extra credit.   4th Hour: Lunch -  Well, I saw  Armando ,  Daniel ,  Sylvia , and some other people at lunch today. It was fun to see them again after the long summer. =) And, I hope to see more of you at lunch! Come by and see me, I'll either by at the ramada next to the cafeteria or in the G Food Court.   5th Hour: Accounting (Jones) -  Just like the previous classes, all introduction material for the first part. Then, we had to make this "shirt" out of paper and design it about our life. We had about 20 minutes to do that, most of everyone finished and we will share them with the class tomorrow. I think there were only a couple of Sophomores in that class, most of them were Juniors and Seniors.   6th Hour: Photo (LeWallen) -  We first had to sit outside the hall way and he called us in by alphabetical order and we have "teams" so we work with one another. He talked about the assignments, barely any introduction and what's due tomorrow along with his expectations. He kinda sounds like a professor from a Universirty (his "A" hour calls him that).   7th Hour: Math Topic 3 Geometry (Hughes) -  She was pretty nice for the most part. We have a quiz over the syllabus so I'm studying for that tonight. We went over that along with some questions just like in World Studies. One question was, "Why do you think it's harder for other students to learn math?" Then, we read this article about how the left and right brain works. According to that little article and the facts, I'm a right brainer (which isn't the best for math). That's all we did today for this class.     Only  178  days left until school is over!
