He is now heading to IIM A. CAT enthusiasts will find his blog very useful - the way he planned, his concerns, strategy for the test, the gds and the interviews :). If you ask him now - "How do u prepare for cat?" I am sure he will reply "No big deal da. Just mug and go and u will get !" But blogs dont lie, do they ;) ?  Not Srinivas - He was my college junior and a colleague at my current company. In addition he is a CE from ISC.    The rest are assorted techies ...
