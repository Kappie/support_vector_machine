I want opinions...i don't rlly want corrections :P  So far I've been told that the story's "henchmen" are very western style, now, i don't rlly know how so, cause i dun watch american shows and such, but i kno from past experiance i dun LIKE that lol, ill see wat i can do also, hino-chan kinda annoying  otherwise imo there's lack of descrpition, seems rushed, bbut it's just for fun.  ~how come no1 is reading it!!! =_= POST!
