Any comments/feelings/complaints/sorrows/anger/stress/suggestions/questions about the AP English test?  To me personally, the multiple choice section was harder than the free response section (Still a lot of interpretations, confusions, and ambiguities in the multiple choice answers). And within the free-response essays, i felt that the one about the English conventions/language was the hardest, although since the passage was about Emerson, the familiarity of the author kind of comforted me a little. It was weird talking about how Emerson persuades the reader his opinions with the use of "conventions", such things as grammar, the parts of English language that I tend to ignore its importance. Yeah so overall, that was a challenging piece to write as the essay prompt demanded "a well reasoned and organized essay".  But other than that, I liked the free-free response essay that we can draw on our own experiences, readings, and observations for that last essay. It wasn't so strict as to just interpret a small piece of passage..   Please do respond with your opinions on the AP english practice test.   Thomas Chen
