I got up today, went to my Anatomy and Physology class and did my usual dicection of a cat that Kristina, my lab partner, and I so lovingly named LUCKY. Today I though, "I know that things are tough right now but I can make it." I will stick around in Oshkosh for a while. As far as what college I am going to I still dont know. I have one more sememster to decide what one I want to go to. I think that a private college would be the best way to go. More of a focused attention on individual students. I hate being a number especially now a days where an individual in defined by a number and not a name.   Another thought I had today was I really miss making a differance in people life. I have never had the same satisfaction as I did when I was working in the Emergency Room. Most of my time was in the Military medical side but still. I did a year at a hospital in Appleton. I really felt that I had a purpose in life. This A class has me thinking medical again.  Well today the drama of the OWS (operating while suspended) charges against me were dropped. That sure took a lot of work to get taken care of. My plates had been revoked on my car a about 2 months back. ALWAYS pay parking tickets!!! I had to go through so many hoops to get the Assistant City Attorney to drop the charges that there is no way that I am ever going to let anything like that slip again. The cost in time and gas ended up costing more the what the origonal ticket cost me, a mere 15.00 USD.   well I think that I am going to get going. I will post something more meaningful when the urge hits me. I am new at this. Trust me, I have a lot to say about the US and its involvement in the world. That I can save for another day.
