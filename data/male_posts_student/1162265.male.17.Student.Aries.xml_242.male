The tryouts were great to watch and all.  Oooh, and Becky was pretty zealous about handing out flyers for me (everyone wants to help) and I thought that was pretty cool.    So, school proper wasn't anything special.  It never is.  Pictures though, you digital pictures are crazy.   You can find out so much about people by looking at their pictures, and it's so funny to see them on the internet.  People will usually hold in a lot when you meet them face to face, but on the internet your personality is all you are, so your more or less free.  I guess that sounds rather cryptic.  My eyes are seriously sore.
