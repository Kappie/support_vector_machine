This is especially true of my time in Japan. So I'm realizing that maybe part of my  need  to go back to japan is a desire to fix some of those things. And thats the only place I feel I can go back to and really heal my memories. But, just for a moment, lets supose that I had. I returned to my school, my family, my friends and was true. I was myself and didn't act so self-absorbed, so asuming. I didn't pull away from everyone. I treated my family as they deserved. Would I still be regreting so much there? Would it ever go away? Or perhaps my thinking that the solution is to go back and try to fix things is just as silly and misconceived as my thinking the solution from my troubles here was to go to Japan.  Wow. That felt good.
