These things break at least 3 fundamental laws of life that I cannot tolerate being broken.  Law 1: The "Don't undermine the non-radical feminist movement" law  Now, there are some honest-to-goodness feminists out there, actually trying to help their gender.  These are undermined every time another of these pieces of shit come out.  How, you ask?  Well, since you are ignorant enough to not get it, I'll spell it out for you.  These pieces of shit encourage the radical, FemiNazi movement, the "I am Woman, hear me roar" bull-dykes who think that they need to emulate the actresses in the movies in being independent, intelligent: the woman's woman!  This does nothing for the feminists who aren't just in it for the publicity, those working behind the scenes, those actually making a difference.  I mean, if you really want to make a difference in the movement, we real men are rooting for you...if you boycott these pieces of shit.   Law 2: The "Make money despite having a thin plot, shitty acting, and no real redeeming characteristics" law  This one speaks for itself.  These things have nothing going for them, and yet succeed because of all the pre-pubescent girls who can't possibly think for themselves to actually pick a worthwhile movie.  Even Roger Ebert, the living half of Siskel and Ebert, is starting to pan these pieces of shit (There was a link on Fark to this, and as soon as I get a hold of it if it hasn't expired I'll put that baby up).     Law 3: The "Prevent the Vader from getting laid by anyone worthwhile" law  Another one that speaks for itself.  If you are slow enough to not get who the Vader is from the URL of this site, you are a bonafide douche.  These pieces of shit raise the bar for guys high enough that I, your beloved blogger, can't get over.  The guys in these movies are hot, sensitive, nice, and a bunch of other things that don't fit very well together.  These movies make it seem like many guys are like this.  But let's face it: if such a guy existed, he would either get killed by all the other guys in a heartbeat or he would just snatch up the hottest girl around and leave all the rest of us in the dust.  Most likely, the first.  Now, every girl wants their own Prince Charming, but none exist, so they obviously settle for the hottest one, ignore the fact that he's a jackass, and then complain when they find him sleeping around.  (Everyone knows someone like this, because there is no short supply.)  This means that I, who am intellectually superior, actually give half a damn, and am generally nicer to girls than the average future grocery-bagger (I tip my hat to the Master of the Universe with that one) get shit (because I am around par for the course on the looks department), while those dipshits get 'em every time without much work.  Over and over again.  I mean, if these girls don't get it after they've been cheated on for the fifth time by some jock who can't even read (If you are reading this and go to my high school, I shouldn't have to go farther.  How these idiots get in to a Jesuit school is beyond me...oh wait, that's right, they're around the average age of 18 in freshman year), then they've been so thoroughly brainwashed that I don't have a snowball's chance in hell.    On a side note, I just finished off the best week this summer.  Kick ass.  That week was awesome.
