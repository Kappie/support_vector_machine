I also don't fancy Lisa in a proper way. Or... God, I feel dirty.  OK, points about people I fancy  (varying amounts) that aren't purely about them looking good: Miller: Clever, VERY good blog technique, really nice and friendly, good musician. Rosie: Really funny, good musician, accepts the fact that her blonde hair doesn't stop her from being able to appreciate blonde jokes. Lizzie: Such an amazingly nice person it hurts, will cope with you being really boring and actually LISTEN to what you're saying so she can not insult you at the end. Attractively reserved. Seems to have a good musical ear. Mel: Stunningly nice. Really good singer, not a bad songwriter, not afraid to tell me to fuck off. She tries to sing along when I play "I Don't Know How to Love Him" wrong on the piano. Zoe: I've known her for far too long. She's really nice, fairly trusting, easy to talk to, has a good musical sense without showing it around too much. Will hug you without any sort of pretense. Nice to go for walks with. Sally G: Really, really nice when she's not in a very bad mood, and even then she only seems mildly annoyed. Amazing flautist, astounding pianist, writes very atmospheric piano music (she played some in the recitals I went to see last year). One of the best singers in the school. And just cool. Rachel (Mabel): Has an astounding ability to be really, really nice and really cold at the same time. THE best female voice in the school, and can play the piano too, but I'm not sure to what standard. Fairly open to short conversations. Caroline: Good trumpeter, great musical ear. Not too taken in by grades, but judges on proven merit and experience.  Really friendly and not very quick to take offence. Open to conversation and will allow a little bit of leeway before she starts to stop listening.  OK, I think I've proved it. None of the people I fancy are evil, they're all musical, they are all really nice. What a lot of bloody effort...  Love, Jon Roskilly
