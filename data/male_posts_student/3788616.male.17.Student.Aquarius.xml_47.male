Vice President lah! What else?! haha... oh well, guess i've been expecting it for a while liao, just that at times, i've been so preoccupied with wanting to be the President and scared of being the secretary!  Oh well, that's settled, Lance the president and Wee Keat is the other Vice President, but... oh well, all 3 of us have to work together right? Hmm... i'll try lah... At least, i will keep my end of the bargain with regards to the CO and stuff lah ah...  Hmm... well, ok, that doesn't bother me much lah... haha... ok, anyway, i need to address something lah... It's to Kelly, and please ah, people, don't start again! i am getting really irritated already! Kelly, i don't know why, but when we started talking to each other today and stuff today, it seemed really awkward, i guess, in part it's due to my problems and it's my fault, however, i really hope that what has happened wouldn't affect our friendship and our communication. Yeah, cause, i guess, i still treat you as a valuable friend lah, and i wouldn't want to lose a special friend like you... so yeah, cheer up and please ah, don't feel like so awkward when you see me lah! You were like shying away lah, and not only i realise that loh! lol... yup, that's all i got to say for now...  Jill! Keep things that i tell you to yourself yeah! haha... somethings, other's shouldn't know, as in, yeah... haha... and please lah people! Stop scandalising her and me together! We are not together! I don't like her in that way! We are just friends!!! ;)  However, well, i think i am really concerned about something else in my mind with regards to a certain other person lah... Hmm, well, i just was wondering how are you doing yeah... how was your test? haha... anyway, good luck for your bio test tomorrow yeah! You better study hard! haha... and please ah, take care! Your daddy already promised to help me take care of you hor! so yeah, please take care of yourself! haha... anyway... yeah... that's all lah...  Hmm... oh yeah, there's so much to say lah... haha... but, yeah, i can't be really open in this blog, so the person concerned would actually know what i am talking about and i guess, understand everything in a better view lah ah! *winks* ;p  Ok, just want to say something to the rest of the new committee in the CO, all the best guys and congrats! Let's work together and bring this CO to greater heights, cause... The Best Is Yet To Be!  Yup, that's all for now lah... just so tired, except i do know that i am so dead for tomorrow's math test lah! :p *bleah!* heex... take care lots everybody! Keep smiling!
