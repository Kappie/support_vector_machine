Luckily I made it to school in the nick of time, or else it would have been half a demerit point for me. We had early lunch today, so I went and met Steve at Bukit Batok Central's MacDonald. Hang around for 45mins have to go back already. Today is practical day, and we get to go the kitchen and strut our stuff. I kinda screwed up though. Today both my handphones was down, bloody unlucky day.
