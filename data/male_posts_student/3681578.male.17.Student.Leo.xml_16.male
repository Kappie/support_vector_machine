I first signed up for a friday interview but then I realized that it had conflict with my INTACT class so I re-signed up, thinking that I signed up for a thursday interview...  ...then came the ADS interview week...John P told me that we had consecutive interview slots...I, thinking that it was a Thursday interview, ok...I'll just think about what I'm gonna say...  ...along came Thursday...man, I was freaked because the morning came and I haven't actually thought of what to say...enter Math class...I was thinking of Illegal Drugs while Ms. Aberin ranted on Implicit Differentiation...I went out of C-109 without a thing in my mind on the drugs since I was reviewing my Differentiation from my memory...  ...then Thursday lunch, John P just came up and told me that our interviews are indeed consecutive but on Friday, meaning the day after that...so I was like, yes! Meaning our interviews were postponed...  ...enter Friday, today, before INTACT class...I just finalized my arguments about illegal drugs stuff and just after lit (my last class after the supposed interview)...I was thinking of my intro with Mennold...since we had a half-cut in lit, we went to caf early and settled at caf up...  I relieved myself of tension by trying to teach Raj and others Bridge that I just learned from GABAY...Then, enter 1200...my supposed time of interview, I had to like hurry to SS Consulation Room...when I reached the Faura-Dela Costa benches...I met Anna and John P...so we altogether went to the ADS Interview Room...  We, according to a sign on the door, have to knock upon arrival and someone had to admit us...he was a rather fat man...so there...we settled, all three of us and he just said that my interview, and John P's, was postponed since at least three people yata dapat ang manood sa amin...I was not really like, yes!, as the last time my interview was move but I was kinda thinking it was a sign...maybe it is a sign...  So there, my new ADS Interview Sked is on Monday...just before Math Class...I do hope it goes well na...  There...
