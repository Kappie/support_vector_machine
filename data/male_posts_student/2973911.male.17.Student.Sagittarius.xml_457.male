I hate numbers because I have to work with it everyday. I'm not yet an accountant. I don't have the CPA board passing to be an accountant.   P-chan is like so busy with his trying to get a job. I barely even talk to him anymore.   Rai, weebee as they say in the chatrooms.  Debb, where the heck are you?
