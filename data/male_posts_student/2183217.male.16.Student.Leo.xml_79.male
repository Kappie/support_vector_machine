Kind of like HEY MOM IM IN TORONTO SEE U TOMORROW sort of deal.  Me and my friends Lindsay and Cayleigh bought our 100$ bus tickets last friday , and later found out that the interview at much music was cancelled. Monday i was taking a nap and lindsay c calls me and says BLINK IS COMING TO MUCH!!!!! Then at like 9:30 i decided to tell my mom we were going because apparently there were no busses coming home past 9 ocklock and we would have to stay there overnight. My mom basically said, Why didn't you tell me, i would've helped you plan it. UGH!:@ lol . anyways . Ok so , At 6 am on Tuesday lindsay C picks me up and tells me shes not allowed staying overnight but it was ok cuz there ended up being a bus leaving at midnight. We go to Berri Uqam with Cayleigh. On the bus, we made signs that said like PET MY CHESHIRE CAT! and WE SKIPPED SCHOOL TO COME HERE FROM MONTREAL . Cayleigh sprayed a man in the face with gel while he was trying to sleep and he woke up like WTF EN. When we got to toronto, he told us where much music was and gave us good luck for getting into the show since he heard all our conversations. We ate hotdogs on the way that we put mustard mayo bacon bits relish pickles and ya it was gross lol . ok so we see much music and almost get hit by a truck trying to get there, but we claimed "it doesn't matter" . We got in line, and got the last 3 wrist bands to get into the interview!! During the interview, Mark tried to talk to someone in the crowd but was interrupted when Lindsay yelled WE'RE FROM MONTREAL!! then they said, why hello:) Je Va Au Plage! lol we also got autographs and i dyked in speakers corner the way snake told me 2. Then we shopped around a bit and ate at a mcdonalds FULL of blink fans, hardley anymore we talked to had tickets. Apparently they were impossible to get because the show cost 1$ and it sold out in 7 minutes. We heard stories of ppl being in line for tickets since 630 am and even the ppl first in line didnt get any. Someone even clicked Buy Now on the internet the second it turned 10 ocklock and they were already sold out! So it looked like we werent gonna get in, but everyone wished us luck anyway.  The show was supposed to start at 8, so we took a Street Car there, and i talked to this lawyer who apparently used to be a punk with green hair and listened to the Exploited back in her day . Pretty weird. Anyway we got to the place at like 6, and found out the tickets were going for two hundred and 50 dollars!!! YA RIGHT!! so we just stood around kinda , we didnt kno what to do. Then a Guy came from inside the place. He asked for our names, and said to give the ppl inside our ID to get into the show. We were like for how  much $$? hes like " Free."  Lindsay C and Me...BURST INTO TEARS!!! i never thought that would happen but it did!!! So we got in line for 2 hours in the freezing cold and sang 99 bottles of beer on the wall , with the rest of the line. It was funny and great. Then we got in the show, and i got killed in the mosh pit, it was super amazing and fun! I got punched in the mouth and now i have a fat lip, i got slammed onto the floor and fucked up my rib . I lost my shoe like 39 times and i have bruises everywhere. BEST. DAY.EVER! after the show, we took a taxi to the bus station and slept all the way home.. Now i just have to tell my dad that we went on  a feild trip with school to Toronto the way my mom told me to O_o!
