Anyhow back to yesterday, well I got my hair cut, and It's not bad but It's not great I miss my old hair to be honest with you, alright It was long and curly and kind of annoying but it was possibly THE greastest hair style I had ever had, kept me so warm and It got to a point where I could'nt do anything with it so I didn't care what people thought, now It's alot shorter and gay-er but hey I cant spike it so Im good you know? After that I went home and spoke to Charli online at which point we were still on a break we talked about general stuff nothing that had happened and to be honest it felt good, I liked it, made me feel so much happier and at the end she said she might want to see me (but that doesn't matter now were together again) and yeah she said she felt better now she talked to me. So yeah then I went to meet Hans for Coffee's yet we didn't get Coffee's, we sat in Roath Park for a while and talked about stuff and then went investigating alleys, looking at graphiti and such, so many Crew's in Cardiff, Examples: Roath Ryderz, Penylan Posse, Splott Cru and there are quite alot of Mash Up's which me and Hans think is some sort of Mash Potatoe competition. Anyhow we then went to a corner shop and got some sugary items and ate them, icing sugar, cookies, drinks, choc dips and sugar puffs. We took those and sat on the steps of a church and ate them mixing the drinks, sugar puffs and icing sugar together which was very hyperactive, the cookies were fucking awful so we lined them up across the road and let cars drive over them. With any left over icing sugar we did a MASSIVE art attack in Roath Park it was the ghost of Mr. T which was cool and Xav and Lee said they could see it so me and Hans were proud, she then left and me Xav and Lee went to Nicks were I ate a steak and an easter egg, popped some balloons and then me and Nick had a cucumber fight outside which was awful... didn't go to plan AT all. Then we went to the cinema which I was pretty much screwed as it was a late showing and I wasn't meant to be home late but yeah we saw Shaun Of The Dead which was cool but not for a third time seeing it. I got hiome about quarter to 12 which wasn't nice as my mum was angry but then I decided to grab my dinner go to my room, ring charli, eat the dinner, sit down, drink a glass of chocolate milkshake and wait for it aaaall to blow over!...
