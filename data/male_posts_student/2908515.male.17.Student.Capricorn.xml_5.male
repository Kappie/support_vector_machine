Pat had invited me to see Hot Shots 2 or something but I declined to spend time with my family.  You know, there's only so much family to go around but tons of friends.  But sometimes I feel that I don't have friends either, but thats another story.  Anyway, my mother wanted to go to the mall.  But I disliked going to a place without a reason.  If I go to the mall, its to do something.  To buy something or to look for something.  But when I go with my family, there's really never a reason to go and we'll just walk aimlessly around, slowly, conversationallessly.  If thats a word.  It feels like I'm wasting my time.  Even if we didn't buy something, talking would be nice.  But I can't find anything to talk to them about.  They're just strangers to me.  And thats really sad.  I don't know.    We bought some pretzels.  Not some pretzels.  More like six.  And I wasn't hungry at all.  I didn't have anything today except for pretzels and some ice cream.  I feel so sick.    My mother wanted to see a movie.  But I told her that maybe she should go alone with my father since their movies aren't really suitable for kids to watch and I wanted to see those movies too with my parents.  But I know that I would be stuck watching the kids in some lame ass movie like Scooby Doo or something.  But she insisted that we should all go to the mall anyway.  So we're at the mall and my mother suggests we go to the movies now.  My father was obnoxious and blurts out, "Why, there's nothing good out."  I think that totally killed my mother's mood.  I felt a change in atmosphere and I knew that he said something bad.  And I totally agreed with my mother although I didn't help much by saying that she should have just left us at home and went out to see a movie with my father.  What I really wanted to say was that my father should go fucking home and do whatever and the whole family minus my father go watch a fucking movie.  You never know hypocrisy until you're yelled at for being a bum from a bum.  Namely my father.  He yells at me far too much about my flaws.  How I'm not a super student.  How I'm lazy.  How I like odd stuff.  How I'm nothing like him.  How I have dumb friends.  How much I suck in general.  And it makes me so sad.  Because it feels like he doesn't love me, or that he loves me because he has to.  If he were to get a divorce with my parents, he would die.  He doesn't pay for his medicines, he doesn't have enough income for rent.  What's he to do?  Die.  Sometimes I wish that they would get a divorce.  So that my mom will be happier.  But I know that its selfish of me to wish that.  Because I would be happier than my mother.  Its for personal gains, and I guess thats what I qualify as selfish.  I wished I had never prevented their threat of divorce a few years back.  I wish I had kept my mouth shut when my parents were planning on divorce or maybe I should have encouraged it.  Whatever.
