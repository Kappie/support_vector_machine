I mean, i truely truely love this girl, i dunno, its weird, i've neer felt about anyone this way before, it makes me feel all bubbly inside *hee hee*. But like seriously, if any body has some comments on realtionships like this, please post a comment here,  that'd be greatly appreciated :).  I LOVE YOU MORE THAN LIFE IT SELF CASEY!!! :) (and trust me, im a big fan of life, so, yea, that means i love you alot^_^)           okay, i hate drugs soooooooo soo soo soo much. i cant stand em, they piss me off so much i just wanna scream. AAARAAAAAAAARGH! everyone should just go straight edge in my opinion, they should have a zero tolerance for drugs, or for the scum on my boots that sell them. I say death to all druggies! i almost got kicked outta my last school for an incident involving a drug argument. In my drug and alchohol class, we had to draw anti-drug posters, and mine were  *ahem* a little graphic, and such, involving druggies getting kicked in the head by boots and what not, and they htreatened to call the police. But i think they should be happy that at least one kid in this whole fucked up generation has the sense and the balls to do away with all that peer pressure shit and friggin respect my body, ya know? oh well, enough ranting for me, i think im gonna go night night, going out with casey tommorow :) Im already beaming ^_^ night everyone.
