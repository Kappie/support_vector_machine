You should give thanks to him in good times, which is obviously easier then the bad times. You should give thanks that he is in control of all. It could be much worse. It is better to give up your life then to die apart from God.  This is all for today, I had a better Thanksgiving then most years. Dominique came with us to Merced at my Nana's and Papa's. We all had a good time. I shall talk to everyone later, I might not be on AIM but if I am, don't hesitate to say "Hi!"  To whom it may concern: I am sorry for any blow ups I have committed that may have affected your life. It doesn't happen often, but when it does, it happens largely. I'm sorry.
