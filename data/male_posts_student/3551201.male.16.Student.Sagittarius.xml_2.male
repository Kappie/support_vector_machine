(Speech about the Challenger disaster).  "The best social program is a productive job for anyone who's willing to work."  "General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization: Come here to this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall."  "The nine most terrifying words in the English language are, "I'm from the government and I'm here to help."   "A recession is when your neighbor loses his job. A depression is when you lose yours. And recovery is when Jimmy Carter loses his."  "I hope you're all Republicans." (to surgeons as he entered the operating room following his assassination attempt)  "Our friends in the other party will never forgive us for our success, and are doing everything in their power to rewrite history. Listening to the liberals, you'd think that the 1980s were the worst period since the Great Depression, filled with suffering and despair. I don't know about you, but I'm getting awfully tired of the whining voices from the White House these days. They're claiming there was a decade of greed and neglect, but you and I know better than that. We were there."  "A leader, once convinced a particular course of action is the right one, must have the determination to stick with it and be undaunted when the going gets rough"
