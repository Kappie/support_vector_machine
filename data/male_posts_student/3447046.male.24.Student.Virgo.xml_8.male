If you like space and all that good stuff, check out the Cassini-Huygens web page out at  urlLink http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/index.cfm .  After that, if you would like to discuss the mission, connect your IRC client to irc.freenode.net and join #cassini .  JPL staffers show up when they can to talk about the mission.    You can find up the up to date log of #cassini  urlLink here .
