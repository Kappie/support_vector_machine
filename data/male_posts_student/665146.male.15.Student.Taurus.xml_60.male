What follows?  Evidently, that we can be independent of God.  ‘The religious sentiment will compensate us for all our losses.’  But there aren’t any losses for us to compensate; religious sentiment is superfluous.  And why should we go hunting for a substitute for youthful desires when youthful desires never fail?  A substitute for distractions, when we go on enjoying all the old fooleries to the very last?  What need have we of repose when our minds and bodies continue to delight in activity?  of consolation, when we have soma? of something immovable, when there is social order?”                                                                                         --Mustapha Mond, to the Savage                               I love this quote...  I really do.         First off, I'm aware of how long it's been since I've posted anything on this blog, and I'm honestly sorry.  I really want to keep up on this, but I'm lazy and overworked and those two never go together well...         Anyway, I believe many things about this quote.  You barely ever (if never) see philosophers question the power of God in the future.  But if by some chance we had the power to keep youth and prosperity, our need for God as a source of guidance and comfort would be an archaic concept.  It seems to me that God is only a personification of fate.  He is the variable of society and the reason for everything that happens from birth to aging to death.  So if we gain control of fate (keep in mind that such is impossible and I’m speaking from a hypothetical point of view in reflection with the book) then God makes no difference and there is no God to pray for.  People can enjoy the frivolities of life in a blissful stupor, free of worry.  Of course, as in the book Brave New World, psychological conditioning and brainwashing would have to be induced upon humanity at an early age for a life without fate life to work.  But then again, we’re not too far from that now, are we?         Still, it lingers within my mind that the controllers of such fate would be considered gods and thus ruining the whole point of eliminating God anyway.         I'm not trying to destroy God, or even hint at such.  I just find this one quote amazing.  Brave New World was written in the 1930s!  The fact that it's philosophy holds true today amazes me.  Go America....  Chthonic lifestyles are only the beginning.
