This year I'm in an apartment that comes with a real fridge, so I don't need my dorm one.  So I put up a sign saying it's for sale.  And tried really hard to be funny, but the best I could come up two days ago when I posted the sign was "I'll even help you push it down the hall."  Which isn't really that funny.  I then posted a message on a message board about it.  And tried harder to be funny.  And the best I could come up with was "refrigerator was one year old yesterday (happy birthday)," which manages to simultaneously be unfunny and make me sound like a moron.  Now, if I were to have to re-post another sign (which I don't, because someone bought the fridge, despite the sign's lack of funny), it might read something like this:  Single, White Dorm Refrigerator Seeking New Home  Housebroken; hardly ever leaks on the rug Not lactose intolerant; stores dairy just fine Drug/disease free Mostly enjoys just sitting at home Likes: baking soda, electricity, and ice trays Dislikes: arrogance, poor hygiene, and pickles Unable to have children  (Which, of course, would still not be funny, but would at least demonstrate some effort)
