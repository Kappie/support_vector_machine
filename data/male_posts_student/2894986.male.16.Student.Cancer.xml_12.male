Having three older siblings that all attended college, I've had the pleasure of visiting them at their colleges. Now I have a good feel of what kind of college I would like to attend. Not many people get the chance to get such an in depth look at college life. But I've had 3 visits to 3 different kinds of colleges. Each view gave me a differnt perspective of college. I got the perspective of living off campus, in a dorm, and on campus in a house.   So what have I concluded about the college I want to attend from theses visits. As for the size of the college, I liked the large and middle sized schools. I decided that I didn't want to attend a small school. Each of the frist two had their advantages and disadvanatages. The large campus gave you plenty of room and mad it feel as if it was seperated enough from the surrounding world, which I liked. The size of Dayton's campus was nice becasue there was nothing that was too far away to walk. Another very important aspect that i learned the college I attend must have is good weather. By going to Rice I learned I don't like the really hot weather. By going to Illinois I decided I didn't like cold, snow on the ground for 3 weeks weather. Dayton's weather was something I could deal with, maybe somewhere a little hotter though. Distance from Louisville is also something I have decided on by going on these visits. The college I choose must be fairly close. Definently nothing over 10 hours.  I'm really glad I got to go on all three of my visits. They were all exciting, entertaining, and fun. I can't wait to go on more visits. I think it would be fun to spend a weekend with both my brothers at college, too bad I missed out on the that last year for a stupid dance. And I can't wait to go on my trip out of the country this summer. That should be yet another eye opening experience. And I get to see Jeff! Hell yeah.  In other news, my intramural team put yet another 'W' on the board this weekend, even with out their best player. While I was away, my team squeaked out a vivtory as the clock expired. A hal court shot at the buzzer gave our team a 30-28 victory. Wild Card game this weekend. Who knows what will happen. Also we have managed to get a soccer team together. I'm really happy about that. I can't wait to get out there and playa again. Don't know if we will be any good, we'll find that out tomorrow at practice. That's all for now.   Watch the Lamb....(Even if he is roasting, theresa)...
