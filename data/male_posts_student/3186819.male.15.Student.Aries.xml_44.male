Child Labour  Sure, there are kids overseas who work in sweatshops, etc for next to nothing. But if you think about it, children and teens do so much around the house it is astronomic. We do this to "help out". But think, if we left, the amount of work for parents! Well, stay at home parents wouldn't feel the crunch. My typical day goes as such:  Wake up, drink uber amounts of coffee, run to my bus. Sit in school "learning". I get home. Make supper, do laundry, clean. Bring purse to mother, take phone calls, sometimes make lunches.   If you don't count school, I spend a large part of my time doing chores! It is starting to annoy me. And it never fails that every time I sit down to do homework, "ROBERT!!!" i hear bellowed throughout the house. Usually my mom needs something. Then I sit back down to work some more, "ROBERT!!!" again, this time maybe my sister. I do whatever and sit back down "Ding-dong" "BARK BARK BARK YAP YAP" goes the dogs until I answer the door. I sit back down "RING!!!". IT NEVER FAILS!  Well, c'est la vie!   The loss of a pet  Well, it has come to be. On the 8th/9th of June, my dog, Chelsie, is leaving us forever. She has been sold. How many nights have I spent with her, trying to keep her active. How long have I looked after her. And for what? Another heartbreak? I find tears welling in my eyes as I write this. If its this bad now, I will be insane when she does leave.
