Ohhhhh but that would be a laugh... in 50 years I imagine he'll be just like Halle. lol.  anyway theres not much happenin here, about the only thing on TV is terminator 1 and I don't especially like that movie.  perhaps i will go play towers or something.  I think i've inched my way back up to around 1500 by now.  yeah so nobody has any idea what i'm talking about cuz your lives are so boring... lol    Hmmm who should I tell? everyone eventually but who will be the first i wonder?  haha now you'll be dying to know what my secret is... I've narrowed it down to 4 people who I might tell first... maybe it'll be the first one of those four to ask me.  hey that reminds me the other day i wrote this crazy poem thing in my planner accross the tops of all the pages.  it was kinda fun actaully. Here we go:    You're standing in the street, and then you think, "Why the heck am I standing in the street?"  And just as your beginnning to turn and leave, it hits you, gushing by you as if someone opened a door and cold air is rushing in.  And then you realize your mistakes, and figure standing in the road isn't such a weird thing to do anyway.    Crazy i say, absolutely CRAY-Z! lol    The pic below is the Milwaukee Art Museum, which looks something like a combination of a ship and a butterfly...  click it for a bigger picture.     urlLink
