On Tuesday I was called by a Marine recruiting guy and was told about the Marines and If I wanted to sign up, I said yes and I didn't sleep at all, around 8:30am the next day I went over to Wal-Mart and took a little hiring test thing at the store in one of their little machines that they have, and when I came back I went straight to the toilet...then the bed and slept until 2:47? The recruiter was going to come to my house at 3:00 so I got ready, I took a test to see if I could be elegible to just sign up as a Marine.   Well I passed and then for the rest of the day I just was on the internet looking around and downloading playstation iso's, but this time I was going to go to sleep because I had to wake up the next day(today) at 11:00 to got to the office they had and give me a presentation about the Marines and such well I got back home at around 2:30 and then just munched on some Funyuns and found out the internet was back so I first put the CD I got from the Marine stuff and then this.
