I started this thread with my friend Meky for people who change thier clothes often and I think it will be a hit. It is called the SACD Rehab center which stands for "Sever Avatar Changing Disorder." I also got a few other friends into it, they all do the same. And i am talking to a few people from the thread and people are having avatar changing withdrawls.       It looks like a got a few friends into this journal thing. I know of two who are making ones and then i think there is another.
