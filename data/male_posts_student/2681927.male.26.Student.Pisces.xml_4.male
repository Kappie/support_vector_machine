But anyway, on the top of the page there are an ad that will send you to  urlLink Answers In Creation  or  urlLink 7 day Creation . I invite you to take a look at those pages, they are quite interesting as such, but make sure you visit  urlLink the Panda's Thumb  and  urlLink Talk Origins  as well.
