It is insanely hard and time consuming, thx Ms. Patty.  And this is for everyone who doesnt know already, I made the school newspaper staff as a writer so i think thats pretty cool.         First off i feel bad because i havent talked to anybody (the busy-ness is overwelming) so if you are reading this (the very few that still check up) sorry and I am partly free to talk because Im done with Euro.           The school art show went off pretty good, it was probably really boring to the guests because once you walk through the room, thats pretty much it.  The band was interesting, not the stuff i heard on the demo, but thats alright i guess.  I thought they were ok and i liked the tribal dances and bongos.  I had a lot of fun working up at ticket sales, i think the people that came are weird, they kept handing the money to the wrong person.  After that i went to jacks game and had some fun with kat and garrett for like an hour.         Angel was on last night, it wasnt very good, cept for the reference to a little "party" involving Dharla and Drucilla.  The Fred thing was sad and i miss her character and i dont like where they are headed with Ilihara.  The whole Immortal thing is horrible, i dont think this apocalypse actually has a story to it, we know just about it as much as the characters do and for that fact, as much as the writers (who probably make it up a week before it airs).  They killed Spikes character and they are driving Angels into the ground.  Is it just me or are spike and angel getting gay?  They act weird together now and its very disturbing.  Next we will see angel and spike falling in love on their path to be the champion *shivers with disturbance* Remember what angel said at the beginng of the season where he had no prob spanking men?  That was just the begining.  Oh man Joss, if u happen to stumble across this humble little journal, then heed my words, KILL SPIKE!!!! AND MAKE ANGEL AND BUFFY DO IT!! AND BRING BACK ANYA! KILL WOODS AND BRING BACK jenny, o and maybe professor walsh and what about that one lady, whats her face, buffy's first roommate in college, and molly and amanda and vi.  Just a thought Joss.          Well kiddos thats all the time that I have for today so ill see you next time aboard the magic school bus!
