I closed 'The Skoop' E-Zine after just 1 issue, the 1st issue was amazing, really good and interesting, but the reason I closed it down was because there was very little interest in it. I MAY start it up again, but we'll see what happens. If I do decide to bring it back, then i'll let y'all know on my website.  Tomorrow (18th August) i will HOPEFULLY have the 'Music' page on my website open, Ive produced 3 tracks and will get them up on the site for you to enjoy.  Im looking for people to join up to the message board, it's takin a little time for the word to spread, so the message board is a little bear right now, but im sure that will all change very soon. I will be adding LOADS of more topics to it, and im also gonna be starting competitions so look forward to that. - If you are interested in being a Moderator for the site then please get in contact with me.  Peace (update tomorrow y'all)
