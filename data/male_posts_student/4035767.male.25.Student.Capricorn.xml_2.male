It was largely mindless, but my favorite part was this (paraphrasing):  O'Reilly: You claim in your film that Bush lied about WMD's.  But as it turns out, the CIA, British Intelligence and Russian Intelligence all agreed that Iraq had weapons,  and now the 9/11 Commission says that Bush didn't lie.  Will you apologize to President Bush?  Moore: No, because he lied.  O'Reilly: But he didn't lie, because he thought what he was saying was true.  Moore: He said something that wasn't true.  That's a lie.  O'Reilly:  It's a mistake, not a lie. . . .  A few years ago I went to see  urlLink Jacques Derrida  speak at UF.  HIs topic was "The History of the Lie."  All I (and others with whom I've spoken about this talk ) got out of it was "A lie is an  intentional  misrepresentation of the truth."  Thanks, Jacques.  That's deep, bro.  In any event, if my friend Casey (who sings for  urlLink Suicide Note ) mistakenly tells my friend  urlLink Cole  that Suicide Note is playing a show tomorrow night at  urlLink Common Grounds , and then Cole tells me, would I be justified in calling Cole a LIAR when I found out the information wasn't true?        Michael Moore is an idiot.  And he's desperately slow on his feet.  Kudos to O'Reilly for getting the interview, but he loses points for dropping the ball on the threat Iraq posed to the U.S.
