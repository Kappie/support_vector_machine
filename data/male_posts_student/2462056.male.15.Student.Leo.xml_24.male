I was at Trevor's the other day and his brother turned on their CD, and that reminded me that I have their CD, so that's what I'm listening to.  So yeah, yesterday I had to do some yard work, which wasn't that bad because there wasn't that much to do.  Then I just kinda sat around the house for a long while, watched TV, read my book some.  That night I went to B-Webb's birthday party at Buffalo Connection.  It was really fun.  Haha I was expecting there to be like, a bunch of people I didn't know since he was a senior, but it turned out to be pretty much a Varsity Singers reunion, haha.  It was really fun though.  So yeah, we all just kinda sat around and talked and ate until around 9 when everyone started leaving.  So yeah it was a fun night.  I couldn't get much sleep last night, so I read my book.  I'm ready to write another section of my summer work on it, but I really don't want to, because it is boring and time consuming.  Claire gets back in 12 days! Yay!
