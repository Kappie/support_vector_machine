Then I watched Dark Fury, which is the anime that takes place RIGHT AFTER Pitch Black.  Wooo, so exciting. Make sure to visit www.rooneycom.net and get your $5 ***@rooneycom.net email. Supplies are unlimited, but hurry up regardless! Also, make sure to buy LOTS of RooneyCOM gear.  That's all for Thursday, which sucks, because Friday's are Hell! But I might see Spiderman2, if anyone will come with me.... >.  -Reb
