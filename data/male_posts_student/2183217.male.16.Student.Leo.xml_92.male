Shoutbox is coming soon, or whenever I get around to it.  Still have to fix my AudioMatch.net image and possibly a few other things but tell me if you like the new layout by clicking the comment link at the bottom of this post.  And by the way, Stoney. That picture of you is staying like that until you get a job! Bunn you!
