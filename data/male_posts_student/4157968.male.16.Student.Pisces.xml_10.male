While visiting Grand Canyon with his wife John Kerry (in typical fashion) vowed to devote more money to our Fledgling Fedeeral Park system. This idea, was met with wide applause (naturally, seing as the audience were national park goers) but I question the meaning behind this promise. In typical election year fashion, Kerry once again makes an empty promise that stirs up a fervor amoung potential voters. In trademark style (might as well give Kerry a flashy logo and stamp it on anything he says or does) Kerry makes an appealing promise, without any thought or true agenda behind it. Kerry fails to realise, or perhaps fails to adress, the lofty financial responsibilities needed to validate such a promise, and instead favors empty promises and purple hearts. Americans need to wake up and realise that a man who voes against increasing funding for our troops in Iraq, and yet in his acceptance speech promises to send in 40,000 more troops (while also pledging that he has an exit plan, though never actually telling the public what that it), can never be a fiscally responsible president. Kerry assails Bush for his record defecits, and he's right, in the past Bush has'nt been fiscally responsible in any sense of the word. However, Kerry's economics do nothig to substntiate his claims that he is a more fiscally responsible president. While Kerry promises to "cut the federal defecit in half, quicker (another vague-Kerry-staple word) then the Republicans!" He plans to do so while raising exspenses in several areas, and cutting taxes in the middle class. True he does plan to roll back tax cuts in the upper class, but with the far greatr number of americans who would benefit from middle-class tax cuts, versus the number of americans who would be adversly affected by repealing Bush's tax cuts; I question whether little to any new revenues would be gained from this endeaveur. Kerry promises a brighter future, but what he really wants is a brighter-coloured house...
