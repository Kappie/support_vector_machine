I just thought of that actually just now as I was busy working away at my church's Presentation for worship tomorrow. My day's actually been non-stop "action" if you will say.....never really stopping for a break or anything....yes the average Saturday....plus more work than usual. Hehe.  My day started at around 10 or so....with me getting up aftera 1 hour delay and immediately beginning work on my theory papers. Hehe all caught up already....I only got two more papers left =P. So after doing a crapload of that....wow already 1130. So I go shower, then ate my breakfast from good old McD's =P. So quickly ate that....played some piano.....and off to piano lessons...  Yay.....3 marks for theory papers. I MANAGED A 96! SOMETHING I'VE NEVER DONE! HOLY CRAP! So yeah there was one highlight....Melody's not the only person with a 90+ now.....MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA. Enough of that though.....after some marking of theory...played some pieces...then off I went back home...where I had to wait for Underhill, Okanski and Robert to head down to my place to do some work on our project...  And for project working today: we organized who's doing what then everyone left. Yup....Okanski was amused by that huge-ass light I have in my family room...and Robert's roller coaster actually looks pretty cool. This project is actually pretty retarded....making a theme park for the digestive system? L-A-M-E. Our ideas are pretty cool though. Gastrointestinal (G.I.) Joe....heh a creation by Okanski. It rings though hehe. And so after Okanski and Underhill leaving first, Robert played some DDR for the first time in his life....then left shortly afterwards.  I'm gonna zoom by the rest of my day briefly.....as my fingers seem to be frozen and cannot type....and plus I wanna go on SC for a bit then sleep...  Theory Donut Clinic #2 for me: Productive. Got some work done while chatting with some people........and found out that Jaclyn Jung's sis seems to be one of those typical Asians who likes really high marks. She was complaining about an 85 in theory. I was surprised....since back then when I was in gr. 1 theory....I was happy with a 70 lol. High standards from a grade 5......or whatever grade she's in. Her sis is good at music though so I'm assuming the same for her. So after working on some theory......I then left with a Maple Syrup donut *one of the ones from Timmy's* and then headed to church for worship practice...  IT ACTUALLY LASTED LESS THAN 1 HOUR! So after doing rehearsal w/ Steph and Gavin....and then got a ride home from mom. But when I went downstairs to get my bag...  Hmm....no one really came to tonight's movie night @ LCAC. It kinda make me thought "ouch" since my dad even spent time makin' a dinner and stuff....but at the same time I guess it was just this week....plus this was a first time thing. Hopin' though that more people would come next time....kinda a bummer I guess.....but oh well.....it took more than a week to build Rome as they say. And my church's Chinese Ministry does tend to be less participating in events I guess than the english half. Maybe one because many are fairly old.....but even the younger people seem to be too "busy" with other things. Well...prayers I do believe will be answered, and I guess this is just one of many other items I can pray about. It was kinda crappy to see that sight though....I really hope that one day more people at my church will see that a church isn't just a building to enter on a Sunday....but can be used for other events as well...  Oh well.....getting off that subject though...I came home, but that never really got outta my mind since my mom was talkin' about it with me on the way back home.  But getting home....had dinner.......and quickly begun working on the church's Presentation for tomorrow.  Oh yeah, also checked on NHL.com........THE AVALANCHE WON AGAIN! YAY! 3-2 SERIES ONLY NOW! TWO MORE GAMES AND THEY COULD MAKE WESTERN CONFERENCE FINALS! COME ON AVS! Plus lucky Jenn.....she got to go to a concert led by the one and only CHRIS TOMLIN! *Shakes Fist* Lucky kid =P. Why must London be so lame? Also apparently Josh now has most of his Linux figured out....and I finally got those pics sent around to Jason and them from my camera. Lol the day when  Gavin "Judo kicked" a cinderblock haha.....BLAST deleted it by accident though =(. Plus the white pipe that turned into a hat/kung-fu stick lol.  And now.....after all that work....time to relax a bit. SC then SLEEP! Later people.
