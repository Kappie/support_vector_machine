So I saw one leave that caught my eye, it was slightly torn on one side.  So against my better judgement I grabbed for it as I walked by.  I ended up getting three leaves, one was torn completely to shreds.  So I dropped that one.  The other one was tiny, and didn't have a central vein yet, so I dropped that one. The final leaf was the original one I wanted.    The leaf didn't look overly significant, I guess.  It was a green leaf, normal for a bush.  It had a central vein running up the center, and had a pointed tip.  The cut in it's right side is what bothered me.  It's better half was cut.  I looked at it, I'd already plucked it, so I knew it would wither away soon, but could the leaf ever have been fixed?  Or was the leaf ruined from the start?  I thought about that for a bit, looked at the leaf somemore, and realized, their was no easy answer.  I'd either throw the leaf away, or continue to hold onto it wanting to find a way to fix it.  In the end I dropped it.
