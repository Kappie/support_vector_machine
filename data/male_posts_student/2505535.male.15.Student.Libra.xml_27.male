Yes, the entire front page, sentence by sentence.. then if we finished that we were allowed to number pages in our books. For Fucks Sake.  But English today was fun, one of my teacher's accidently fired a BB Gun at someone, then tried to convince us it wasn't a BB Gun, just a "light air rifle" *rolls eyes* It's a gun, that shoots BB bullets, therefore a BB gun. Silly English teachers. I tried to get a detective hat for my play in English -  GCSE speaking and listening - drama - but none of the english teachers had one.. but for some reason they all offered me their BB Gun they had around.  Right, that's all from me today, need to play some more Zoo Tycoon Complete!
