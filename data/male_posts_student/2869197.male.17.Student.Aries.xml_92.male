I took some decongestants and ibeprofen and took another nap until 9. A rare feat. Normally, when I awake, I stay as such. I'm thankful I didn't today, because that nap fixed my headache up swift and quick.  Well, I had my first date with Emily since the camping trip. Strange as it seems, she still tolerates me. She brushed off the negative energy built up over in U of M and says she enjoys my company. I hold my position as boyfriend for now. I admit, I'm quite surprised. Judging from her blog, I was as good as gone, doomed to be dateless until 2021 (the beginning of my next dating cycle...long story). Yet here I stand, alive and with girlfriend. Something few readers of DD literature can truthfully say.
