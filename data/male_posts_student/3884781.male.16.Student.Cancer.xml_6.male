Yes, last Thursday I happily jumped into the car at the prospect of getting away from Yeovil for a few days, but all too easily forgot my last encounter with camping.  About a year ago my Dad decided it would be jolly nice if we all went for a lovely 'low effort' camping holiday to Tintagal (a small town in Cornwall where King Arthur was supposedly born) as an answer to the cries of "Why can't we go on holiday" and "I'm bored" that issued endlessly from my sisters.  Big mistake.  Within hours we had discovered that our pitch literally teetered over the edge of a cliff that plunged to an inviting (yes it was that bad) rocky outcrop and the sea. Inevitably the tent took ages to put up, my labeling system was obviously not as clear as I had thought, and then it started raining.  Soon we were rolling into town through thick sleet and fog having given up on the tent, trying to find a cozy pub, or similar, to eat at. My Dad eventually gave up trying to find anything cozy, he commented that half the town seemed to have disappeared since he had been there last - probably swept into the sea. So in the end the chip shop it was.  That night my Dad developed food poisoning, and a bad back from holding the tent up to stop it blowing away. His insufferable optimism took a knock too.  You can imagine the rest.  Well this time my Dad said it would be better. Well for him it would be - his girlfriend plus family were going to come too. He also decided that was would go to one of those 'adventure park' themed sites, "Lots for the kids to do, it'll be fun!"  Well unfortunately, I don't know about you, but capsizing in the middle of a filthy, freezing artificial lake with no hot showers in the immediate vicinity and with a bank of people jeering and shouting at you, does not constitute fun.   Catch the rest of my shocking tale, in the next episode of, "My Campsite Hell: How Camping Nearly Killed Me!"
