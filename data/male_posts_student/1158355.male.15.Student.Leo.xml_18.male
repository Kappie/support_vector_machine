I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it's going to begin. I'm going to hang up this phone, and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world... without you. A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries. A world where anything is possible. Where we go from there, is a choice I leave to you."  Today, school was fine but I found out some disturbing information from my cousin which was spread around about me, it wasn't true. I can't say what it was. Track was hard. Tomorrow morning I have the meet so I have to eat alot of pasta tonight. I'm playing basketball with Matt and Paul and then going to the talent show with Matt, Mike and James... our band. Our band definetly owns.
