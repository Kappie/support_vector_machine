 Yeee-haw!!!  The Titans won today.  I watched it; it was such a close game in the beginning, I was scared we might actually lose this one.  But, boy, once we got that safety, the whole team turned around and the momentum shifted into out direction and never changed back.  We whooped their asses.  Yippee!!! 
 Aite, I'm still working on getting my "old" blog back up here, so bear with me for the moment.  In case you didn't know, I took it all down because Dana and Michelle and their momma were finta kill me.  They seemed to think that this was all disrespectful to Dana.  While I don't agree, I took it down because I didn't want to have to deal with that kind of shit.  At Michelle's suggestion, I wrote Dana a note explaining what I'd done and why I'd done it and appologizing.  It was three pages long.  I gave it to her in second period when she was giving Fernando a picture of herself.  As I handed it to her, Fernando screams out "Oh, a note.  What say it?"  I wanted to kill him.  He is so annoying, he get's on my everlasting nerves.  Geez.  Dana also gave me a picture, without anything on the back, and I was like "well, you know your gonna have to figure out something special to write."  She just said "okay."  (She wrote on the back Friday morning.)  But Fernando thought he was so special because she'd written on his "To: My best friend, Fernando.  From: Your best (U.S.A.) friend, Dana"  He thinks he's all that and a bag of chips, but he's really just falling into her trap.  Muh hah hah hah.  I warned him, but it was up to him to listen.  ROFLMAO!!!  That really sucks for him, but he's really getting on my nerves lately.  He's been copying what I do a lot lately.  He knew about me and Dana and became "best friends" with her.  After I "bad-mouthed" her on my blog, he did the same on his, just twenty times worse.  When I took mine offline because it was "offensive" he did the same, replacing his with a message that was exactly what I'd told him I was feeling.  He's just doing everything I do, and trying to outdo me with them.  It's getting on my fucking nerves, I wish he'd stop. 
 Okay, I'm going to do some more work towards putting the rest of my blog up. 
 BTW:  A cat is sitting in my lap purring very loudly.  I really like cats; I think I'm a cat person.
