Marten, I'm sorry you don't like my topics, but this is my blog as much as anyone else's.  I don't always like your topics either.  Deal with it. (And I mean that in the nicest way.)   On the plus side, according to my established behavioral patterns, I should be out of the swooning "I need a girlfriend" phase in a week or so, when I will brief enter into the "women are evil" phase and be back at good, old, apathetic me by mid-November. SQUEE!
