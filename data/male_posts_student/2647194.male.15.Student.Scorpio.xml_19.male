Thus, we came home.  Weekend recap: Friday: With hopefull prospects for the weekend, we headed north, packed for 2 days of pure skiing. Derrick's mother came along, so that meant a few good hours of talk talk talk. Good thing for headphones.  I basically spent that driving time being absolutely wiped out from that week, listening to The Wallflowers, Red Letter Days, and having some good thinking time.  Saturday: I attempted to cross-country ski using combi-skis, a cross between classic and skate, but failed slightly. I'll obviously have to work on using those things. However, I did have a damn funny faceplant in the snow, along with a big stupid blister on my foot after that.  For the remainder of the afternoon, I spent my time testing the slopes out at Spirit Mountain on Valentine's Day. Alone. It gets damn cold up there too...  Sunday: Waking up with one hell of a stiff neck, only to find out you have a sore throat and you're not going up to Lutsen for the day is not, to say the least, enjoyable. The horrendous neck was from a few "crash and burn" yardsales I had in the Terrain Park, which I care not to mention. Needless to say, I walked away that night with a stiff neck, a hyperextended thumb, and a damaged confidence dealing with a pair of skis.  That pretty much brings it all up to the current moment, and my feet are still cold. arg.
