I was just playing.  I think this may have been a mistake.  And then I had to fool around with making it not completely unreadable, and adding back in my counter codes.  If someone's looking to do some pro bono blogger template design work and thinks they can work magic here, please, I'm all ears.  All feedback on how to make this site look cool is more than welcomed to e-mail me with thoughts.  Frightening.  Hope it didn't startle you.  UPDATE 2:38 PM -- I think this looks ok, yes?  Maybe?  Tell me.
