I'm also not sure why... But i am really sorry that i have shown my temper to Aisyha and Shi Kai and a few... Sorry guys...   Hmm... Well, let me see... Yes... During recess... There was this short plump guy commenting that Ling Feng was ugly... Hello??? Why don't you go and find a puddle pf water and see it yourself if you are good looking not??? If not, PLEASE don't make any comments bout the way people looks... In fact, you DON'T LOOK GOOD! Please don't think that you are handsome... YOU ARE NOT! Is good that people says that you look like Wilbur Pan... Don't be so shameless and claim that you look like Edison... PLEASE DON'T DESTROY HIS IMAGE!!! Incase you don't know, you are not popular in our class!!!  You also commented that i'm a sissy... LOOK!!! I'm just being able to befriend with girls better than guy... You call that sissy??? Please... This shows how ignorant you are and childish... So what if i am one? Besides, its none of your business! I live my own life... So the decision still lies with me... Why not talk bout you??? At least i am better than you in turns of size and character... I don't always make rude remarks of other and being BREADCRUMPS all the times... Whatever it is... I definately make it clear that i am not a sissy... This goes out to every single people...  So now proceed to Civil and Moral education... I've spent almost one period of time takign a nap while the class was watching the movie 'ohm bak'... i was awaken by the laughter of the class...   Next is the chemistry lesson... Hmm... It was ok... Except got to see some faces... Urgh.. Feel so sick... How i wish i could get out of this school as soon as possible!!! Finally, from next Chemistry lesson i won't be going to 4E3 any more! Yes!! but i've still got to see one's face in Phycis... Thanks goodness those people who sits around me also detest that person... Every Physics remedial enjoy critising that person... Haha...  Well... Now feeling very weird... No words could express what i am feeling now... Sorry Amamnda, i shouldnl't say all those things to you... Really.... Don't know why out of sudden have a kind of feeling that some one squeezed my hurt and it feel sour... i only have that feeling when something happen on the 19th of a certain month... But after that i no longer have that feeling already... Why it appears again??? *puzzled* i wouldn't want to fall into the terrible trap again... Never!!! Please give me energy and courage to prevent my self from falling!  That's all i've to say... Good night... Sorry to post it so late...
