I've found it almost crippling to get out of bed on days in which I don't have class.  Staying motivated is a problem.  This whole thesis/job search is reminding me of when I had to write stories over the past year.  Cause I'd only get "work" done if I started playing guitar, believing that I was being "productive."  So when I get scared that I won't find a job, I start working on my thesis.  And then when the problems arise, I start surfing on the good ol' intronet for jobs.  I'm so inexplicably scared and as Jeff Tweedy would say "Lone, lonely, alone."  Nothing seems to satisfy and I dislike a majority of the population at this school and area.  I feel tounge tied and wonder if I can really carry-on a conversation with out being negative about something, or letting on to all that bothers me.  Inherently, I know I'm good, but I don't think that counts for much these days.  I see girls in my classes and they are so absolutely beautiful it keeps me from ever saying something.  I used to believe that things would be better if I had a lady to confide in, but now I don't.  And with every passingdayweekmonth YEAR! it seems more difficult.  I can't even remember what it was like to be excited about something.  Christ, its been about a year since I was last on a date.  If I could cry I would.
