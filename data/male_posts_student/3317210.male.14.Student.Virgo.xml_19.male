The world's crumbling around me, and I'm trying to not fall by clinging onto things that may not be there. To clear that up:    The world's crumbling around me  - To explain, my family is extremely confused at the moment. Believe what you will, but a smaller family doesn't make it any easier. The only time I see my dad is essentially when he tells me to go to bed or catches me up in the middle of the night. My mum isn't feeling well recently, stress seems to be getting her down. My best friend is having a rough time, but I'm not depressed about that, just a little worried. I was asked on the bus "How old I was" when they noticed I was reading an animation book (*hint hint* to illustrate some of the concepts they used cartoons...) I've got a crush on a girl who probably only notices I'm alive because I accidently nudge her with my locker (It's not her fault she doesn't know me though =) ) and overall, things are looking down.   I'm trying to not fall by clinging onto things that may not be there  - I'm hoping that by being a generally good person things should work out in the end. That theory is still under scrutiny though *sigh*. I'm also hoping that I'm good at CG. Or at least get better. Or discover some hidden interest. Something! Time will tell...   Anyway, =)   Exams  Got 19 out of 20 for my creative writing, and it wasn't prewritten! =) The given topic was "Nightmare", and I came up with an idea of a guy getting drunk, and waking up a few hours later to see a huge sparkling diamond on the finger of his girlfriend =) Marriage for him is one helluva phobia lol I think a majority of my marks would have come from some of the sentences like:   She gave him such a cute look that it made bunny rabbits seem aggressive =) Ryan walked into the kitchen, wearing a grimace that would make the dead feel sorry for him   Of course, these aren't the  exact  quotes, mainly because I haven't gotten the story back yet   Of beautiful people, conversations, arguments and romance  Beautiful people are commonly thought of as a little stupid, but is that true? My personal thoughts are that "normal people" usually spend much more time reading or something similar to that, even if they are quite active socially, but with "beautiful people" they spend a very large majority of their time on a superficial basis, parties, friends, walking around and showing off, etc. I wouldn't take me as the best resource by the way, just a personal theory =)  ----------  Conversations  Arguments I'd like to try and find out why the main conversations and arguments take place. Here's my small compiled list so far... (by the way, thought about this while on the bus)  Actually, I won't list them quite yet. I just noticed as I was writing them down I was making a sweeping generalisation in some of my comments. Not very realistic at all. But the main one is that people usually find things interesting if they are immediately related to themselves. For example, I asked on a mailing list, instead of "What should I do to get into the industry" I asked people "What would you do if you could start again?". From that, people listed a vast resource of things they HAVE done, and whether that worked, and what they WOULD have done, and how they thought that would work... Very thought provoking stuff they wrote  ----------   Romance, Romance, Romance  =) I'm always wondering how you should go by "romance" (instead of love, I use the word romance, because it isn't just love. Love doesn't come and go like the tide, and it doesn't relate to the lower level feelings like having a crush or an attraction etc)  Should you ask any and every girl you have a chance? Wouldn't that make you a little sluttish, and also, wouldn't you compare all the girls with other girls you have had before? Won't you just begin to expect more and more?  Should you wait on that one who you think is the dream of dreams? What happens when you find out you've been building her up in your head, having a fake perception of her? Or when they turn you down, and you've been thinking for all this time that she is the perfect? What then, fallen one?  Should you try to separate yourself completely?  Or should you wait till someone comes to get  you    In wrapping  My mum has just arrived, or will be arriving soon (I thought I heard her car, I guess I was wrong) there are about a  million things  fighting for attention in my head at the moment, and none are getting that which they deserve... Strange huh
