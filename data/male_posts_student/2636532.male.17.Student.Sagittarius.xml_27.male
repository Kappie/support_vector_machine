As you check your inbox you discover an overly large amount of e-mails that are no more then chainletters. they're annoying, stupid, and they take up valuable space. you have to wonder who makes them? who would actually take the time to create one. recently i recieved one that pecticularly annoyed me...   It's Friday night and you are driving your car. ( what kind of car are you driving?) (YOU ARE THE DRIVER!!!) You can only have FOUR other people in the car with you. ( who is in the car with you?) As you drive, you and your friends start chillin to some music. ( what song are you all listening to?) So, there you are chillin to some music with four other people all of a sudden this crazy driver hits you in the back! You are flying down the road out of control. You hit a speed bump and the car flips and lands upside-down in the grass beside the road. You lay there crying because you are in so much pain You hear nothing but silence. silence silence silence. You try to yell out to your friends, but you are in so much pain and shock the words won't come out. You lay there for about 2 minutes, but to you it seems like 60 minutes. You finally hear something. You hear the ambulance and you have never felt more relieved. You lay there, still in the car, thinkin about your family, friends, School, past holidays, old friends, old lovers You start to pray for the other people in the car and for yourself. The paramedics get you out of the car, put you on a stretcher, and then into the ambulance. you see nothing and hear nothing but a void....you are alone You don't get a chance to see the other people that were in the car with you As they drive to the hospital, you pray and think to yourself "Am I going to die?" Where are my friends? Are they okay? What's going to happen to me.......? Did you die or not? What happened to your friends that were in the car with you......? They all died. All of the other people in the car died. They are all gone. You'll never get to see them again. As for you... you died too. Wait you were just imagining....right ? But what if it were real? What if it really happened to you? Think about it.... That car was the LAST car you were EVER in with your friends. Those four people were the LAST people you EVER saw. Did you pick the four people in the car with you wisely... or do you wish that someone else was in the car with you? The song you were chillin to was the LAST song you EVER heard. Don't you wish you could have had the chance to tell everyone you loved them? Don't you wish you could have told your parents you loved them one last time? Don't you wish you could have kissed your boy/girlfriend one last time? Don't you wish you could have told your crush how much you loved them? Don't you wish you could hug your friends one last time? Don't you wish you had the chance to do all of those things? You still do. Send this email to everyone you love, hate,... friends, family, even enemies. Just send this to everyone you know. This really didn't happen to you. But, pray for all of the people that it DID happen to. AND remember this quote: "Live every day to its fullest......" and when someone says that they love you, know the meaning of it and mean it when you say it too.    now is it just me or did it just ask you to pick 4 friends that would die with you? now i don't know about the rest of you but i wouldn't want any of my friends to die with me. why would anybody want 4 of their friends to die with them just so they were the last 4 ppl they saw? I really hate chain letters...but i hate ppl who believe them even more. how can an e-mail in any way shape or form affect your life? seriously, sending an e-mail won't give you good luck or good sex. and not sending it won't cause you to be shot by an albino midget. i think people who send them should be dragged out into the street and shot dammit! -Matt
