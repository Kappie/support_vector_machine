She keeps my life running smoothly and if she left me or died, I wouldn't have a life anymore.  I would be an empty shell on this earth that is still capable of moving.  I feel as though everything I do is for her, everything that I am, my heart beats, my thoughts, my creations, every move that I make, it is all for her.  I don't run my life, she does.  I'm glad that she does too, or else a few people would be dead by now.  Kasey is a good poetry writer, everything she has made has touched me dearly and got me thinking about how it relates to my life.  Some of her writeings have made me cry because of some of the topics and what went on in them.  Like Sister Dearest, that is probably my favorite one.  Kasey and I have songs that we declared ours, Perfect by Simple Plan, The Reason by Hoobastank, and Pieces by ummm... I don't remember her name, I think it's Ashley Simpson though.  When Kasey broke up with me (that only lasted a day), the only thing I could think of was the song "The Reason".  It descirbed exsactly how I felt and what I wanted to say.  Sorry I'm just going on and on lol.
