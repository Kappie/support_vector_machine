They've been doing construction on our road, so what is normally a two-lane road was cut down to two lanes by cones the workers had put up.  So I turn into what had been the west-bound lane yesterday...and there's a Mack dump truck coming right at me (in the opposite direction!).  After hurriedly ducking out of the way into the "dead" lane, I finally figured out which lane was which...  School was ok today; I got back my Political Econ. test, and I was pleasantly surprised with my grade (a B, but I thought it was going to be a C).  Then I had to take a Spanish quiz, and I have no idea how I did (that's the worst feeling...it's so much more comforting when you think you did well or badly).  Anyway...then I ran over to Financial Aid to see if they had my special circumstances form done, and they basically told me not to expect anything (i.e. I'm totally screwed).  Evidently the estimates on the SS form had been low last year, so it doesn't look like I'm probably going to be in the running for anything (of course, the one semester that I NEED it).  Maybe something will come of it, but don't count on it...yeah, nice answer.  So I'm heading out to my car, and I thought I would give the car repair place a call to check in on my car.  Needless to say, not only does it have a blown head gasket, but she said something about a rod in the engine and maybe something in the undercarriage.  Her suggestion was to find a new car; I agree, but I don't really even have enough money for school right now, not to mention car payments.  Sometimes I just wonder what the cosmic plan is at work here.  I mean, I work my butt off, make an honest effort to keep things in order, and it just seems like nothing comes of it.  And I'm sick of people telling me that it will come to something someday; sometimes it just doesn't, some people are seemingly destined to try hard and not reach their goals.  Maybe I'm just one of those people...  Honestly, I would be fine with making less, with simply having a job that I enjoy and quietly passing my days enjoying the simple things of life.  With just helping people out, volunteering with my church and community, enjoying what family I may have.  But that's never good enough (or so everyone seems to say, especially my parents); you have to have more, do more, be more.  Typical American exceptionalism / consumerism / materialism / liberalism / egocentrism...pisses me off...
