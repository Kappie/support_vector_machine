This leaves me wif absolutely 0 confidence in any of those schools.. I wan to be wif sugar. But NY is far man.. The school campus looks cool.. i dont know abt the teaching and the tutorials.. whether the teachers are good or sucky.. but the discipline there is slacked.. one thing i'd like.. i dun really mind NY, but the distance.. its like JJ.. only JJ sucks.. haha.. There's a stiff competition for SA and AC now.. how man.. sian.. gimme some time to think it thru.. there are soooo many factors to  my decision now.. i need to tink..
