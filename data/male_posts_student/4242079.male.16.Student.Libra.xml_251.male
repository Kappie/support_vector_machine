Not because I don't want to go on a holiday with my family. That is not it at all. It's just that I don't have much desire to go to places like that. Honestly, I'd much rather go to some place like Texas, Illinois, or Oregon. Lately, Edward and I have been talking of visiting Missouri. After we began talking about it, I discovered that  urlLink Natalie  and  urlLink Hannah also live in Missouri (correct me if i'm wrong). Coincidence? I think  so . Anyway. I really need to save my pennies, because I have lots of things to spend them on. First of all, a new car. Well, new to me, used by someone else. My car is probably not going to last through the winter. No siree. Secondly, a  urlLink Minolta Z1 digital camera . And thirdly, the trip mentioned above. As soon as I buy the Matt Good CD that I want, the Autumn to Ashes CD that I want, and the Boys Night Out CD that is on order for me at the HMV in the mall, then all of my extra money is going to be set aside for those three things. No more fast food at the mall, no more movies, CDs, and otherwise useless and wasteful things. And most of all, NO MORE CLOTHES. Oh. Shows. I still have to go to shows.  urlLink Geoff Berner  is playing Red Deer soon, and I am HELLA STOKED! All y'all should join me. That includes you, Ellabel, Natalie, Amber, Manda, EVERYONE! Even though you'll all probably hate it with a burning passion.  Well. I think that is about it.
