At the time everything was going fine- fading in out of a conscience state of mind while listening to Rammstein. Then out of the blue it happened, something I expected, but did not really expect.  A little silver car comes up behind our Econoline van and honks. My dad, being friendly and all rolls down the window to see what the fellows in the car wanted. What they wanted we couldn't help them with; in fact, I would be appauled to even think about such things.  "F Bush!"  That's what they said folks. Four male college boys out for a cruise down the interstate, and instead of making their rounds at the local bars and checking out the ladies- the natural thing to do- they wanted to get it on with the President of the United States of America- a male mind you. However, I doubt the secret service would let them near Dubya.  Humph. It's just like liberals to change their minds. They always said Kerry looked nicer, why not get it on with him?  Politics confuse me.
