It's very good. It's most definately going to be a game worth purchasing.   However.  It just doesn't feel all that  new  to me. Sure, it's a beta version, and definately isn't what will be released to the world on.. whatever the release date is now, but to me it feels like they've just taken the existing  urlLink Quake  engine (probably Quake III), reverse-engineered it the way Compaq did to the IBM BIOS way back when and added stuff like specular highlighting, better physics, better lighting, awesome water effects and fan-fucking-tasting models. Sure, I'm going out on a limb by saying that, and I'm not a programmer, so the sourcecode means absolutely nothing to me, so I can't find out if that's true or not, but this game behaves exactly as if it were a Quake-based game. Right down to the way the Torch works  exactly  the same way as it did in the orginal Half-Life, which was based on the Quake II engine, I believe.  I'm definately going to get it when it comes out, but I think a few people will be rather disappointed that it's not the technology leap that they are expecting.  If I can figure out how to take a screenshot, I'll post one ot two =)
