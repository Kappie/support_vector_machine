But, just as we were leaving at ten past eleven I got a phone call from a very pissed of sounding Susie (my boss).     "Adam," she said. "You were supposed to start work at 10:30. Where are you? Call me!" Man... She sounded pissed. So, I quickly hurried out of the house (mum not too happy either!)    I got to work and checked what register I was on when I heard Narelle (my other boss) say "Gee, sleep in Adam?" and I said "Nah... My dog ate my roster". She laughed. THEN! I saw the demon herself... Susie. I heard the funeral march playing in the background. Woah.    "Where were you?" she asked.   "Would you believe me if I said my dog ate my roster?" I quipped. Susie gave me a questioning look.   "NO, I don't believe you" she said.  I shrugged: "Ok," I paused. "Sorry I'm late, there was (yet another) roster mixup". She gave me another disaproving look.   "I guess this means you'll be staying behind until 4:30 to make up for lost time?"  "Absolutely"  "Heh, you wouldn't dare argue with me now, would you?"  "No," I murmered. "Sorry!"     So there you have it. Adam's great personality saved the day. Go Adam!    But... today was really boring! Nothing interesting at all happened. Although, Tanya did say me and Jess were getting awfully close at lunch. Pfft... That's bad why?      HAPPY BIRTHDAY TARA!   Really folks, she only looks like that when she's with me. I'm that boring!
