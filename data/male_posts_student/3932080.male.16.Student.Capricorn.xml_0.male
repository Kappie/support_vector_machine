Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Sunshine -Lil' Flip feat. Lea  Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #10  Ever since  Fat Joe  broke out with the smash “Whats Luv?” in late 2002, which featured guest vocalist  Ashanti , it seems that numerous thug-rapper/fox-crooner pairs have tried to answer that very question. Soon thereafter,  Ja Rule  released “Always on Time” (again with  Ashanti ), a song pushing the message that love is all about, well, promptness. Most recently, new rapper  Lloyd  made an attempt to reply with “Southside,” a 2004 single featuring (any guesses?)  Ashanti  that had a decent run on the charts. That duo thought that love was all about secretive sex (“Make sure your daddy just don’t know”), but that still didn’t seem to be it. Then, when the world seemed at a lost for an answer, Lil’ Flip released the second single from  U Gotta Feel Me , the playfully titled “Sunshine.” Subbing in the melodious Lea for  Ashanti , Flip rapped over juicy keyboards and electronic rays and revealed that both  Ja Rule  and  Lloyd  were pretty close; a lady does need to be on time (“Pick me up at 8:00, don’t be late”) and she needs to be kinky on the down low (“I need a freak in the sheets”), but Flip continued to completely answer that year-old Fat Joe query: “We don't have to be in love, we can just be friends!” Finally, an ode to friends-with-benefits that answers what love is really about : not being in love. But while this tender hip-hop ballad is ‘04’s beachside anthem, Flip actually lies a little bit. When he says that he’ll “treat you like milk [and] do nothing but spoil you,” he means more than he’ll “treat you like milk [and] have you waiting outside his door once a week so that he can bring you in, pop off your top, and pass you around the dinner table so everyone gets a mouthful.” I think.   The Verdict:  6.2/10 - The Fork   (3.1/5)
