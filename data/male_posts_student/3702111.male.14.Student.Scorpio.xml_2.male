I called him yesterday to wish him a Happy Father's day but big mistake...I guess he found out about something bad I did, I'm not sure what, but he's Pissed...So i just came home last night...and watched TV in my room all night and didn't say a word to him. It was really boring, the only thing I did was send text messages to Kristin and Kamel in Alabama, and Max at Camp Storer. Well anyways, Katie's cottage was alot more fun than I thought it would be considering there were three guys and one girl, we went tubing and that was pretty sweet this time around but my earrings were pissin me off, I had to tape them so they wouldn't fall out, I think their more of a hassle then their worth. All of my friends are out of town and I have nothing to do, their all gone and I'm so bored. Well I don't really plan on doin anything today, maybe go to the jcc at most, I'll just be sittin around the house. Well thats all for now...Peace up
