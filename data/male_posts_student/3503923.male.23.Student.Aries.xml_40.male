They come as they please, camping where they like, often leaving behind a crater or mountain to hike. Mushrooms in the rain, grenades during war, mosquitoes in the quiet of night; so they come, ganged up in clusters or sitting pretty on the end of your nose. Sometimes with unnerving stealth, camouflaged as a boil, they creep upon you, tip-toeing their way past your elaborate defenses.  Clearasil; is an ambiguous product to say the least. It is a confused misnomer, told what it is, yet behaving schizophrenically. Clerasil, or Clearasil; even if I was clearly to know which, I'd still be unsure as to the why. Zit away, we swat away with this medicated pad. This most invigorating lotion works you deep, penetrating, exfoliating, removing all undesirable impurities. We follow the course of treatment with religious devotion, counting the clock to this hour, setting the alarm for that, applying the cream before sun-down, consuming the pill cleverly hidden in a banana. It comforts our minds to know that we are being pro-active in dealing with our 'issues'. 'I'm on the Clearasil, simply because, clear it will, leaving my face smooth as silk.' Cut out the choccies, drink plenty of water, lay outdoors being roasted by the sun, slap on that burning chemical in the yellow bottle just for fun.  Finally, spot free after solution number 10. Tis been a long haul, an arduous trek, to save face from ridicule from them. The furrows in my brow now bother me, I wonder whether I should worry less. The bags beneath my eyes, they belong to someone else, 'Excuse me Sir would you mind carrying these for me.' Wrinkles beginning to amass, I contort my face in front of the mirror, making it stretch with the strength of my palms, I look hideous; but at last I'm wrinkle free. This double-chin gets me down, it wobbles when I speak, can't I just have one, one just like Jimmy Hill's.  You can become the project if you so wish. A grand project who needs a new design. To be revamped and reconfigured, worked on as a hobby on the side. Pursuing promised perfection on your own, adding glamour to your mundane role. But there is always that spot that you cannot control, a blemish that no foundation will hide, the rough face on your wedding day and the man at the mortuary who spruces you up for the final viewing. The memory of your beauty is already passing away, the photos capturing that exquisite look are fading fast, to be buried in the depths along with the anchor and mast.
