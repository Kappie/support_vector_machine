Sweating.. because i had a fever or because i had a bad dream?  I have a thousand songs on random, why does this one have to come on. I think my computer hates me..  it always finds the perfect time to play the wrong song . It was one of those dreams where i get too close to someone only to have them pull away.   I change my shirt and get out of bed. Chris is home and everyone else is in the city with the relatives. I make a few phone calls wishing everyone a merry christmas and then i took a shower. get dressed.. mellow out to some music.. drink 4 beers. Being the light weight that i am 4 beers on an empty stomach gave me a good buzz. chat with people online. play a lot of max payne 2. andrew walked over here at around 9 and was backseat driver for an hour of max payne 2. parents came home with food and gifts from the city. the most interesting gift i got was my bong.  Hopefully this bong won't distract me too much upstate. I've already promised to myself that next semester i will stay away from all the distractions up there (beer, sex, and drugs) or at least hold them off until the weekend. Lately i've been getting angry at myself for doing some of the stupid shit i do because in the end it isn't worth it.   Ok.. I've probably already lost you because i jump around a lot when i tell stories, i'll try to put all those sililoquies in italics, but i'll probably get lazy and just say fuck it. Ok after drew watches an hour of Max Payne 2, Lauren comes over and then we call Reza to see if he wants to chill and bring over Lord Of the Rings. He doesn't pick up and doesn't call back. Katie never called for our Final Fantasy date either.. so hmm bored. We drive to Andrew's house to pick up LOTR the Fellowship and then to lauren's to pick up a homemade apple pie. After that i drove to north garnerville parking lot this song is totally appropriate right now christmas is over. i gotta stop smoking i gotta find a new hobby. maybe reading books? how about studying? i'm sorry i'm just mouthing off.. me and lauren smoked a bowl next to the playground while andrew watched. it was cold and windy out and my throat was not ready for it.. i coughed. i cough 10% of the time, i like to think i'm a pro. i need to go to the gym. i'm so out of shape. it's not even that.. after i workout i'm in a better state of mind. i can sit here and listen to music for hours. i think my cold is almost gone. i need to go out on a date i think that would make me feel better. i just noticed that i'm typing completely random things, but it's what exactly is on my mind. i think about random things. i used to have such an imagination. two nights ago katie told me this beautiful story about her dream of california and how i visit there and get with this blonde chick with brown eyes and she teaches me how to surf! hopefully by then i'll be a better swimmer. the point of the story is that i lost my sense of imagination.. like i used to sit in class or just sit there back in the day and have the craziest fantasies.. maybe reality hit me? is this real? what am i doing sitting here? i want to do something, i want to make something. i don't want to sit here anymore and do nothing. in fact i'm tired of partying. i want to do something totally different. I want to go skydiving, scuba diving, street racing, flying, mountain climbing. i want to be outside i want to be on the beach, i want to play frisbee. i want to be enlightened. i want to feel alive again.  me andrew and lauren watch lotr and i eat a lot of snack foods. i drive lauren and drew home and now here i am. i think i'm done mouthing off for tonight i'm not even going to proof read or spell check. winamp 5 is evil. it plays the songs you DON'T WANT TO HEAR. Forget December. Fuck December. Fuck you.
