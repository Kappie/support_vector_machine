I woke up after having a dream that went on and on. I was out and about in this dream. and I ended up in a hospital with a spear through my head. I was laying on a guerney and i was wide awake experiencing everything painlessly, it seemed. they ( who ever ) was trying to remove the item from my head. without success. So eventually they cut the end off of the object and slid it back out of my head. there was no damage perse, it was  dream. but i remember feeling the whole procedure. from beginning. without anesthesia. what does this mean, and why did I have the dream?  *****************************************************************************  On another note. I have had a very eventful week. I met some really great people and Jon and I are becomming really great friends. I find him dynamic and fun to be around, in that "around" sense of the word. So three nights ago I was pmmed by this man in Kent named John. We hit it off famously. He said some very interesting things to me in our first conversation. Last night he had checked on some boots i wanted from the U.K. and said they were on their way en route to me via kent. when i asked him how much they were, he said don't worry about it, that I could work off the balance when i go to the U.K. in December. Through our discussion John and I talked about a mutual friend whom He knew personally and i know from our online relationship. So I'm off to the U.K. over the Christmas Holidays for some really steamy times.   ********************************************************************************  I met a local rubberman here in Montreal this week as well. And we are destined to get together in the next to near future. He has a thing for tall rubber boots, well so do I. we have a weekend planned soon. and I cannot wait. My star is on the rise and things look good. I realized that I had to take charge of my life and set my boundaries and persue my goals and everything started happening. It's all good.  *********************************************************************************  So grasshopper, dad is doing better. I am so glad for that. I guess that prayers are answered every day, and we have to be mindful of that. The universe gives up what we need when we need it. You should know that by now, as well, You are loved. What ever happens now, is in the Creator's hands. Be prepared for everything and anything. enjoy life, meet people and have a good time. Wasted Time is Wasted time. Time is a precious commodity, once wasted it can never be regained.   ***********************************************************************************  As for home, all is well, quiet. Peter is ok and things are ok for now. nothing else to report. his trip to New York was good. And he came home with a few changes and revelations. we'll see where he takes them. No expectations, no disappointments.
