Yet at the same time, I must finish the first draft of my script, and get working on Version 2, which I hope to have drafted by April 26.  Three weeks to write 50 pages and redraft it, as well as write 30 pages and redraft 120 of the script.    And people thought I wasn't playing much EverQuest before.    In honor of Kurt Cobain, I went hunting for some downloadable songs on RealRhapsody (yes, I'm a fucking billboard for the Man, I know, but it's awesome...I spent two hours yesterday listening to synth pioneers Kraftwerk), and funny enough, none of Nirvana's hits are available for consumption.  Same goes for Madonna.  The rights to both artists are owned independently, I believe, rather than from a record company, and thus it is harder to get consent on the music.  It's funny when I have no problem burning myself a cd of erstwhile female punk band Sarge, but I can't get the five Madonna songs I enjoy without doing it illegally.  Or paying out my ass.    There's something about the smell of fresh-cut grass...I parked pretty far from school today, thus my sojurn to campus was marked with passing at-home dads casually mowing lawns, decked out in tank tops, unafraid to show a bit of paunch and farmer's tan.  The sight is forgivable because of the smell of wet green, mixing with Hyde Park flavor, taking me back to Springfests in Rogers, or Septembers in Shreveport...times when the world felt like it was moving forward and you were on the crest of the wave, about to put the nose of the board in the water and ride the hell out of the wave.  Both were carefree times, yet I felt much more in tune to what was happening around me than I do now...some of that is obviously that I write rather than do these days, so I place myself in a personal fantasy world daily.  But I can't help to think that I was living more then than I am now...both times in cities of desolation rather than vibrance.
