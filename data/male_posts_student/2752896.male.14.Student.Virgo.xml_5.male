ERGO, i posted =D  Anyway, this wonderful post would be about my adventurous trek  (which was three hours in the car btw) and my lodgings (stinky stinky tents =P) at Rondeau Campgrounds, somewhere near windsor.  So. It was great! spent most of the time biking. Went on a speed bike for the first time. Very interesting On a speed bike, you have to keep ur body low, and near the handle bars, by hunching forward, and if you're going fast on a speed bike, the wind goes down your shirt.   It was REALLY REALLY hot by the way. Apparently, it was around 40 degrees. that's really hot. hotter than toast. heehee  so the heat got me to sweat. ALOT the sweat got the bugs. ALOT of bugs the bugs gave me lots of bites. ALOT of them too fun fun. had to shower like three times a day.  the second day was spent at the beach of lake erie.  the water was great. there were small waves, and the carried me to shower when i didn't feel like playing frizbee the sand was sooo warm. it was cozy. soaked a bit of the sun.  my tanline from my watch last year, has increased it's contrast with its surrounding skin.  after sitting in the sand when your wet, you have to get out and shower.  That's when i discovered there was sand in places where they shouldn't be.  disgusting. showered. lazed around for 5 hours. Ate. Lazed some more.  AHHHH. that's the life   Leave a Comment Dammit!
