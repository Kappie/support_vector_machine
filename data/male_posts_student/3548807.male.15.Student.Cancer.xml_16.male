Stay in at lunch to work on drama skit...peter is a no show...time wasted which could've been spent productively with someone else. CELP metting tonight...mother getting pissy saying that if i don't have an 80 average i don't go...that makes me pissed off! Dan is home for the weekend tomorrow...awesome..can't wait to see him...shiver thinking about him and his girlfriend in the same bed next to my room...(shudder) short post...maybe bigger one tonight. Sam
