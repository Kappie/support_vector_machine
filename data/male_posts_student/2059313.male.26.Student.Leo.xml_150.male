Man I hate phones.  I don’t mind talking to people on the phone, but I hate trying to get a hold of 25 different people to make sure they’ll be somewhere at sometime.  Other than that, we had a production meeting, and then had the first read through… all the actors arrived on time.  The read through went well, and some of the cast were going to Applebee’s to eat (and drink a little) afterwards.  We hung out and had a great time.  But alas it is now time for bed… too bad I have to do some paperwork first.  Maybe I’ll get some sleep.  Anyway, I’m outta here.   11:45 am  I can’t help thinking about my friend and how she’s doing.   11:50 am  I need this time away.  I’m glad I’m here.  I needed to be around some people who aren’t in the middle of some kind of struggle.  I feel bad for feeling that way… but I know it’s something I needed.  Sometimes I think God doesn’t really have a particular schedule for things, and sometimes, I think He plans everything out to the last detail.  I would’ve felt even worse if it had happened while I was here.  I’m glad He let me be there for her.  Well, that’s all the personal time I get for today, time to work.
