I hope he is too, and I promise to have a little more patience with his replies.  I guess I want to get in to too many things all at once.  Take your time Danny.  You should also know that I've received about a half dozen emails from people saying how much they like Danny being involved here.  He seems to be a hit even when most people go on to say he sounds like a complete nutcase.  I think that's meant as a compliment on some level.  Just thought you should know you are drawing a few fans out there.  So have a good weekend.  Blogging will be light until Monday, but I will take the time to read anything that gets posted.  Also, if Danny has any creative writing (non-political), I'd be interested in reading it and offering comments.  Email me whenever.  Later...
