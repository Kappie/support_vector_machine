In an effort not to spoil the film for you, I'll just say that there is an exchange between two characters, in which one of them calls the other on his pattern of living in his own bullshit. He shoves it in his face, tells him to wake up, and dares him to stop dreaming and make something of himself. The other idea I picked up on was the whole "Life Is Short" concept. Time is ticking, you don't know when you're checking out, so make the most of it while you're here, and do that one crazy thing you always wanted to do. Put those two together, and what do you have? A motivational speech on productivity and the value of life. Oh, and there was some cool gun shooting and hassan-chopping.  I wore my hair very spiky today. It's about that length where it can just shoot straight off the top of my head, but not be too obscene. In a week or two, I might be able to pull of a pretty convincing David Boreanaz, circa Angel Season 1-2. I like to lightly pat it and feel it's awesomeness. (patting) It was also mad chilly for early August, so I put on one of my sexy long sleeve shirts, that really sculpt my chest. Come to think of it, Angel wore this kind of shirt too....  what the hell is going on?!?!    Right, I'm not really going anywhere with this. At least, that's usually what I type, before I decide to spill something huge, or pretend to be profound in my thinking. I find that movies always inspire me to change things in my own life, and this one did the same thing. For instance, when I watch The Last Samurai, I always want to get off the couch, pick up my sword, and go out into the field and throw myself back into martial arts. Or when I watch Vanilla Sky, I want to just want to completely open myself up to someone, and fall in.....wait, why is Tom Cruise in all of these films? Is this some kind of conspiracy? Is Tom Cruise  taking over my mind?!   (Editor's note: Dave has been talking an awful lot about very attractive male actors in this blog entry, but would like to assure his readers that he is in fact a heterosexual, and does not wish to engage in sexual activity with said entertainers. He simply wants to emulate the shit out of them.)  Um, so I'm going to end this now, and go back to chatting it up on Instant Messenger. Whew, what a Friday night. Who knows? Maybe I'll even come back later!  (blink blink)
