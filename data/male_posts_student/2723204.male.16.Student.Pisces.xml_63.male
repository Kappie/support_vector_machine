They'll be only acoustic guitars in the background and maybe a piano in the chorus. That's all. Very unplugged. Meant to be soft. Unlike my last chinese song which I wrote, I've got the tune figured out.    There'll be only Kings     First Verse   As the silence fills the empty hallway. A throne now empty who can fill its place? Not forgetting yesterday,  The king came here to stay. All I wanted to be, a loyal subject. But who can fill this place?   Pre-Chorus   A smattering of crimson flowers, Reminding me of the chill which leaks inside. The morning dew settles on the backyard. The butterflies they play.   Chorus:   Oh...h....who can say I'm not lonely? and Oh....h...who can hear me say? Not waiting in this lonely castle, The only sound of the leaves as they rustle. Just hoping that the day will come when, There'll be only kings.  (Guitar Fill)   Second Verse:   Sitting on my throne gazing on my subject. A place I hope I now could abdicate. Endless tears which flow at night, who can hear my cry? Amidst the satin soft and shiny, but tell me why's there pain?  (To Pre-chorus)   2nd Chorus:   (after 2nd verse and pre-chorus)  Oh....h...who can say I'm happy? Oh.....h...who can love me again? Oh....h....why this chilly rain? Chromating silence fills the stairway. So poignant as I go insane........  Just hoping and waiting that there'll come a day when There'll be only kings.....
