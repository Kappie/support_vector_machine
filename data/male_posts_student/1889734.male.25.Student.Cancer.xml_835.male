Since I've been desperately trying to recruit people into ASL, I thought I'd include some pictures of this past weekends action.  The map was hand made by my opponent, and is designed to convey the three dimensional aspect of the terrain.  Note that he built this whole thing for one specific scenario - it isn't usable for any other.  An example of the typical level of dedication you will find in ASL players, and yes, I would love to start building my own maps when I can accumulate some supplies.  The scenario revovled around an attempted capture of Tito by German SS  Fallshirmjagers  (paratroopers) arriving by both chute and glider.  It was an amazing scenario!  Particularly when a stick of SS men mis-dropped right into the center of town, only to be whacked by Partisans before they could even touch the ground.  On the other side of the map, another group of SS managed to come down right on top of my defensive position and engaged in Hand to Hand combat practically while still wearing parachutes.  They slaughtered some of my men and secured the flank.   Ubermenschen  in action.  Anyway, most of you don't really care, but my enthusiasm for the game knows no bounds.  It is the ultimate game system - really more of a lifestyle.  And I'll be glad to run demos at a moments notice....
