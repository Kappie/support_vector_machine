Today is thursday and I headr Owen's dad was on the news! AWESOME! In Owen's language, YAY! Last Sunday I went to some dumb concert. It had the world premiere of this one guy's fourth symphony. It was pretty darn crappy. Hammertime is a better song then that, and that is sayin' something. Monday, I have no idea what I did (nor does my brother). Tuesday, uuh I forgot that too. But I know exactly what I did yesterday!! Hah! Beat that Owen! Now I remember what I did on tuesday. I had an orthodontist appointment. For the idiots, that means some wacko people messed around with my braces. And yes, I do look sexy in braces. anyway I get to get them off October 14. SWEET!!! Anyway, yesterday I pretty much babysitted the whole day. Here's what I did. First my brother, my mom, and I all walked down to my little soon to be first grader friend Ryan. He's pretty cool, untill you spend a whole day with him. We came back to our house and on the way I ran into some girls I know in the park. I hate Ryan! Especially for that! He's always blowing my chances with girls! Oh well, I like someone else anyway. Anyway we went to my house where we got out a marble track and started playing with that. That was fun for a while untill it got really boring. Then we went to lunch at subway. That was good, I ate their teriyaki chicken, which is my personnal favorite. Then we went to the bowling alley which was fun, but since I have a really nasty blister on my right thumb, I had to bowl left-handed. (I'm right handed if you are too dumb to figure that out). I got an 89 which is pretty good left handed. We did have the bumpers up though, for Ryan, so, there weren't any gutter balls. Then we went to the library and I got a book Owen's dad thought I should read called timeline. I haven't read it yet though. Then we went home and played marbles for a little while. After that we went to Bob The Builder.com. (That site will be the death of me). We played every game, all really dumb and super easy. After that, we played fooseball which I tried to let Ryan win by hitting it into my own goal. I kept winning though. After that we came downstairs and played with lego. I started building a base which is really cool. It has wheels so it can move. And then he left. Finally! So we come to today in which all i've done is spent 45 minutes on this stupid blog, (I can't believe I'm doing this just for Owen.) Well that pretty much says everything about my weekend. Er, summer. Whatever. Doesn't matter. AS LONG AS THERE IS NO SCHOOL!!!!!!!!! YES!! Well I would love to stay and chat but, I have a life unlike Owen and Don't spend all my time wacthing T.V. and playing computer. I only spend most of my time doing those things. Haha. Any way, as a clossing remark, if aanyone actually has the patience to read all this, Owen has the worst, and I mean the worst, grammer in the world. Like in one entry, he wrote something like, "This CD has everything accept Hammertime." It is supposed to be, "Has everying except hammertime." Who actually listens to Hammertime anyway? I sure as hell don't. But for now I will bid you all adieu! 		Everyones 				favorite 				blogger, 				Fredâ‰¥
