If you see me walking the road with someone else, it's not because I like his company, it’s because you're not brave enough to walk beside me.  If you hear me talking about him all the time, it’s not because he pleases me It’s because you're too deaf to hear my heartbeat, if you feel me falling with someone new, it’s not because I love him, because you're not there to catch me fall.  If you feel lost, I too am nowhere, I too don't know where the road is going Are we gonna cross each other's path or just completely turn around? Will we just let go of what we had or go to the place where love is bound.  Don't let me walk with him, it's you I want to walk with, don't let me talk of him, it's you I want to talk with, don't let me fall for him, it's you I want to fall in love with.  Answer...  When you thought I wasn't brave enough to walk beside you I was behind you every step of the way  Still filled with awe because of the beauty that stands before me  When you thought I was too deaf to hear your heartbeat, I didn't want to assume anything and I was afraid to lose you. When you thought I wasn't there to catch you, it was because you never gave me the chance, you never reached the bottom you've already grabbed a branch.  If you feel like you are nowhere, I too am lost, I too don't know where the road is going. Are we just going to turn around or are we gonna cross each other's path? Will we just let go of what we had or go to the place where love is bound?  Don't let me walk alone, I want to walk by your side, don't let me talk of something else, it's you I want to talk with, don't let me fall for someone else, it's you I want to fall in love with.  Happiness is not found at the end of the road it is experienced along the way... So take not for granted each moment of yr life  you'll find a reason to be happy each day.  The greatest challenge in our life is to find someone who knows your flaws and differences and yet still willingly embraces you with so much love.
