Dan even got pics taken with them.. sigh.. i'm sooooooooooooo jealous..   i'm still wonderin whether i shld or not.. hmm.. should i or should i not..   i have nth to do right now.. so sian.. hm. mayb i can tell u a little bit more abt ma eng teacher,   Mrs Seah Eng Lan  . lol.. here goes..  hm.. she's basically a nice person.. jus that when she's angry, the bias side of her jus creeps out.. yea..  BIAS .. well.. she will scold those who aren't so good in their Queen MOther's language.. and she exceptionally nice to those who are reall gooooooood.. yea.. that's jus her.. but she's real understandin too.. well, sometimes.. can get really really really  fierce .. her demands are pretty high.. i think that my eng is goin up bcos of her.. hehe.. not that i'm sayin that Mr Darren Chong is lousy, it's jus that.. y'know... yea.. i'd choose Mrs Seah for teaching wise, but Mr CHong, for personality wise.. sorry DC...  abt Ms Evelyn Wu.. ma science teacher... Half the time that she's teachin, i'm not listenin.. so what if i listened? i wouldn't get it too.. she's jus.. in my opinion, not suited to teach... sigh.. i really dun understand what she teaches most of tha time.. simple chapters, of course, the contents are easy to grasp.. but the harder ones, spare me.. i'd rather Traven Loh teach me though he has that xia lan and despicable face.. she jus drones on and on and on and on.. then she will suddenly pop this question, " Do u all understand?????"  the class by then was already half asleep.. so nobody answered.. then she assumes that everyone understands and jus continues.. sigh.. soooooooooooooooooooooo boooooooooooooriiinnng... but can't really blame her.. i think that this is her first few yrs of teachin??? she was ma science teacher too last yr.. and last yr, my grp of frens, really gave her a hard time.. trust me.. u dun wanna know.. there was this once that she was on the verge of tears.. but this yr, everything's alright now.. it's all jus abt her teaching.. sorry ms wu..  sigh.. so borin.. anything to interest me, anyone?  i'm outty..
