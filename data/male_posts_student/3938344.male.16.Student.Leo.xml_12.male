"You've got a lot of nerve And I got a lot of fingers to point While you were busy building knowledge I was already right And a voice like yours Is not a weapon at all Even mine is not a chisel For a thickened skull  So you can chant your anthems to the deaf And we can sit here and cry until there's nothing left Or we can take our voices with our hands Make like knives and make demands"     -Demon Hunter, Not Ready to Die    "Everwinter - Divine state of mind..  In the heart of the north I have walked through the snow; I look back at the trail that I came. One set of footprints I see, but now I know I wasn't alone; Because the trails are not mine..  Into the purifying light I walk without fear; I feel the frost of holiness carry me..  Frozen from the world I'm in; State of mind.. ..of divine! Everwinter.. Frozen state of my mind; Divine in the world I'm in; Everwinter is nigh!"      -Immortal Souls, Everwinter       "I guess you finally made the deepest cut I guess the blade on my tongue was just too much All the words came from my dark side, Now this emptiness is real  You reach beneath the surface more  So could you leave me with my last regret Let me feel the way you left me dead Too blind to see You stole my honesty  I think about the time we lost I think about the time the silence could be words And now the only sound I hear is my guilty conscience Screaming out your name  So could you leave me with my last regret Let me feel the way you left me dead Too blind to see You stole my honesty  So could you leave me with my last regret Let me feel the way you left me dead Steal away my thoughts of honesty"       -Sevendust, Honesty    "She is everything to me The unrequited dream The song that no one sings The unattainable She's a myth that I have to believe in All I need is one more reason I don't know what to do I don't know what to do"      -Slipknot, Vermilion Pt. 2    "I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream But now I have some clarity To show you what I mean I don't know how I got this way I'll never be alright So I'm breaking the habit, I'm breaking the habit, I'm breaking the habit Tonight"      -Linkin Park, Breaking the Habit   That's enough for now.  I don't feel like wasting another hour finding a few quotes awesome enough to fit in there.    Damn, I'm bored.  I have no one to share any of this shit with (who would give a damn).  So, it'll just fester and rot in some long-forgotten part of my archives.  Isn't that nice?
