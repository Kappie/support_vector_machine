So was the method of paying of payment for a coffee I had this evening [by the way I do tip generously generally - just today someone else was paying].  So the flight to Italy was fine enough - my first meal was a challenge though - my only phrases of Italian being 'per favore' [I would like], gratzie [thanks] and ciao [hello/bye]... so what meals did I know in Italian? Well McChicken Nuggets is the same in Italian and from there it was fairly easy if I say so myself. So maybe I might develop my ability tomorrow, maybe not.
