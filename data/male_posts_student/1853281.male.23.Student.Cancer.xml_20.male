I am tired, and sick, i had trouble breathing last night, and slept only intermittently. (still not quitting smoking, though) and i am bitchy and angry because i thought i was going to have some drinks and get a ride home after my night class, but now i have to sneak out of class 15 minutes early to catch the bloody buggery bus and if i miss it it will take me like 60 mins to get to where the express does in like 10. so yeah, must be that time of the month for me or something. I knew growing up with lesbians would do something strange to me. incoherant entry i know, but i am so not feeling well, and i want coffee. I am tired sick, and that is never a plus. maybe i will visit my coffee shope tonight before class, and get my homework for tomorrow done. and than go to class. Maybe they'll actually be some customers now that school has been in session long enough for the students to discover it. Maybe i ditch for reasons of illness and go straight home where i will lay on the couch amd bemoan the fact there is no one to come over and take care of me, get me soup, rub my head, tell me I'm pretty. Maybe i will jump on a train and ride the rails into a pretty future of prostitution and heroin. maybe i will meet the man of my dreams who will sweep me off my feet and we'll move to europe and live the bohemian lifestyle, but with luxury. Maybe nothing will happen, i will get half my homework done, and stare resentfully at my teacher, counting the seconds until my class is done
