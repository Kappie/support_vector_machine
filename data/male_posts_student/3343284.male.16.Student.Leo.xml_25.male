LOLZ !!!  well i think i'll have a maximum of SGD$50 for the outing... hope i wouldn't overspend cuz i'll also need the money to buy something else...  (possible item to be bought...) CS: Condition Zero (40%) The Sims Collector's Pack 2 (30%) Clothings (29%) Food (1%)  (LOLZ !!!)  one more week to the outing... not really looking forward to sunburning... lolz !!!  after i get back from the outing... i think i'll hafta re-adjust my sleeping schedule  IF  i stayed overnight...  ... and the rest of the three weeks of my final month of holiday will be spent preparing for the new school term... starting... er... i dunno... i will know the starting date once i go for the orientation at either 23, 24 or 25 June 2004...  (P.S.: Why did i put a 2004 at the end ??? it cuz my time is somewhat stuck at 2003... timelag...)
