From there I escaped throught the sewer drain and felt my riteful freedom. For I did not deserve the prison house, for innocent was I, and see her I must, so escaped I did from the prison lie. How suddenly I came to a building I knew, dressed up right and went on through. Three stories high, the very top floor, was were I met her again. We run for each other, and tears did shed, for my love was with me again. Her hair was long, with a redish hugh, and silky to the touch. Her eyes were green, like emeralds did they shine, when the tears they did stream. She was tall and slender and graceful so,and the definition of bueaty was she. My eyes have never known such a person as lovely as she, and what a love we shared, true and stong, that words were to weak to hold. That night I met her parents again, a happy occasion for all. The next day came her father came to me, and for a ride did we go. Down the subcity streets did the past unfold when he told me what he had done. For it was he, and he it was, who had framed me for the crime. He sent me to prison with none the wiser, for me to slip away from his daugters heart. He had misjudged our feelings though and he could not break the bond. So now he would finish the job and rid me of this world. But drinking was he and foolish he got, for he stopped to refuel and left his gun. I took the gun and fled the scene and took refuge in a house. The cops did come after I apprehended him for he had gotten his rifle. The next thing I knew, I was at a party. The party was for me for I had apprehended a great villian. Sad was I though for thought did I, my love was gone forever. For with me locking her father away, forgiveness was not in sight. Suddenly the crowd parted, and my song did play, for there was my bueaty. She came to me in a flowing gold dress, eyes sparkling in the light. An emerald necklace did I take from my pocket, placing it around her neck, I asked her to be my bride that night. She of course said yes, and the story ends soon, we danced the night away. The air was so strong with our love in full. Together we danced feeling each others soul, and one was did not know that sadness ever exsisted. This dream I dreamt is trully a dream. Every word is true, through and through and I look forward to meeting my girl in reality.
