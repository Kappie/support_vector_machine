I thought it would be torture and the worst weekend ever, but it turned out allright. He didnt bann me from my computer (which I thought he might of) and we saw Shrek 2 at the movies and played with the footy at the park.  Worked some more on my website. Updated design layout. Added some more webpages. Still not finished. Making websites really takes time...  Was sick today and had the day off. My younger brother was hit by a car yesterday and he has had the day off also. He has brused all of his right arm and his back is completely grased. He should be fine though...  Reading more of my book for English, Dracula (Bram Stoker). It is getting to the really good points. Must get off computer soon and start reading some more. (mem. find a biography on someone interesting).
