There was quite a bit of conflict because another group had chosen (by coincidence of course - unless they cheated it off us) the same name as us, "Burger Queen"  We changed ours to "Burger Queen's" and I made a cool jingle to promote the new Mini Burger.  The presentations were really good, except for ours.  We were last and it really sucked.  A certain member of the group went mardy about it, which was quite pathetic.  Dinner time was Hilarious!  Most of Year 10 had lines up from the bench area against the wall, sat down and spread out their legs in protest of the dinner ladies being such evil demons.  We have always had issues with the creatures and today was fight back time.  Becky was a great leader; the dinner ladies seem to really hate her!  After dinner we had to create a newspaper.  Ours was the best by far.  We had produced many pictures and cool reports which made it stand out from the others which most of were in black and white.  After school, Dad came and took us to the cinema to see Around the World in 80 Days, which was really cool.  Steve Coogan was good at acting as the main role.
