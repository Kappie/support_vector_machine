I'll do my best and i'll just have to remember to readthe question thoroughly and remember to write in proportion to the value of the question. Well it'llall be over then and i can celebrate my birthday on thursday in peace,not worrying about exams. Couple of friends are coming over and waching a film: starsky and hutch. And i go back to brasilon sunday. We stayin for just under a month which should be great and we are hoping to go to this place called Brotas which is a centre for adventure trype stuff: rafting and the like. I'll update with a great sigh of relief tomorrow when my exam finnishes.  bye for now
