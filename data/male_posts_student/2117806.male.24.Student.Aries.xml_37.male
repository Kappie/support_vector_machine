If it's sunny outside, we tend to smile more, or if it's dreary and gray, we feel blah and under the weather (no pun intended...I don't think).  There's something about late fall and into winter that makes you want to stay in bed all day, not move, not face the outside world.  It makes me not want to jog, or leave the apartment until at least my birthday.  By the same token, nasty weather (such as rain or snow) always makes me want to move.  When I'm restricted to the apartment because of the percipitation, it makes me want to defy that, to go out and go somewhere.  I always want to take a roadtrip when the weather's at its worst, because logic and common sense dictate that I ought to bunker down and wait for everything to blow over.  I was flipping through my photo album this afternoon, looking at the pictures of my friends from these recent years.  Looking at all the smiles, all the good times, the moments captured in 3" x 5".  It's funny, but most of the pictures are from the last few weeks of school my senior year and graduation, both mine and the one from 2003 (when several of my friends graduated).  There aren't many pictures from the four years I actually spent at the school, just from the last few moments I was there.  I think that's a part of human nature--while we're in the middle of something, we don't ever think of it ending.  In a way, I thought I'd always be with that group of people at Ozarks, that nothing would ever change, that we'd always be there.  When it dawned on me that this wasn't going to be the case (I tried to deny it up until about two or three weeks before graduating), I attempted to hurriedly collect evidence that I'd been there for four years, tangible memories and memoribilia to commemorate my time at that place with those people.    I graduate from OU in about seven months.  In the almost year and a half that I've been here so far, I've made some rather close friends, people whom I don't want to let go of.  And I have nothing tangible to show that I've known them so far, no physical evidence that they've been a part of my life except the occasional faint smile I wear on my face when thinking about them.  I need to find my camera.  I need to correct this inequity.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Yoko Kanno  the Seatbelts, "Ask DNA"
