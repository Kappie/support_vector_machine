It is one of the most insightful, touching, and heart-felt political books I have read. All of the pieces in the book are true experiences of women struggling against all sorts of issues in the context of the S. Asian community. The first short piece was about a young Muslim girl whose father had two wives. It was tormenting for me to read of the pain she went through...   Other pieces talk about rape, spousal abuse, psychological abuse, some talk about defying the odds and winning against the community--all are a testament to the monster that is patriarchy. I am not sure why this has touched me so much. Maybe because I was involved in the fight against patriarchy with my old love and it is fight that is close to the heart. Maybe the stories of these women bring back my own memories of fighting my parents, running away from home, drugs, jail--the trauma and the experiences that follow such risks and which I have a bond with these women who I have never met.   It has even changing the way I want to write the Hindutva pamphlet I have been working on all summer. The pamphlet is due at the end of August and in some ways I still do not know its precise direction and meaning… There is so much I have to say to young Desis…   Don’t stop fighting for your dreams…  Don’t stop loving yourselves and your own ambitions…  But don’t loose sight of your community…  I will stop because… because… I feel the tears of yesterday’s memories inside of me that remind me of my past and I look back at with aged eyes…   I think I will share bits and pieces of the book in my journal because the readings because I feel the sadness of this book on my face and smile.   I liked on the lines in the first poem... the poem is by Gaurangi Kamani   I was the rain of Surat  You were the Rajput Rock   ------------------------------------   Another piece titled Parvati by Natasha Pratap...   I am reading it right now and am happy I can write down my feelings. It is the tale of a very poor but courageous women whose husband is a drunk. She is trying to raise a child, however she cannot send him to school for financial reasons. She teaches him as much as she can, but more importantly she constantly teaches him with love the importance of being honest and good. This woman, Parvati cleans people's bathrooms.    I will also put up what I have written regarding patriarchy in the Desi community tomorrow… I want to have that in my journal because it has not just been a political fight for me, for it was also wrapped with memories of my old love and what we fought and dreamt for… It was fight to save my own heart and dreams…
