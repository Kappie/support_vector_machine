All my friends are in relationships, and now they don't want to have anything to do with me. I never thought it would affect me this much but i guess i was wrong. I'm to put bluntly jealous of my friends, i'm happy for them but i'm jealous of them as well, i'm at the breaking point. I'm getting sick and tired of being the one to keep their relationships in one piece. I want my own, not leech off of someone elses, but from what i think i'm not deserving nor good enough to have my own. I'm left behind lost and forgotten my mom bitches at me for always being on MSN and my computer, well quite frankly if she knew what was going on she'd be bitching and interrogating me even more. *sigh* i raise my hands in defeat, i don't know what's wrong with me, but obviously there's something, otherwise i would'nt be in this predicament.   Another thing that's going all wrong in my life is that i can't stop being a moron. My mom admitted today that she thinks i'm a fucking moron. well i guess the next worst thing that she can do is kick me out of the house. I think that's whatshe wants so i'm not going to give her the opportunity, i dont know where i'd go but i'm going to run away. I can't be around her or my friends anymore, and it's quite obvious they can't be around me either. So i may as well fulfill my destiny and go die on the streets, because i have nothing left...Why arent i loved by anyone?...i mean i give up, i've been turned down by soo many girls that i dont if i can bare being turned down again, i'mgoing into my seclusion again, i donttalk to anyone, no one ever talks to me, i wish i had some verbal contact. I want to here people speak,see their emotional reactions, rather than just seeing meaning less words on a 17 inch monitor. I wish i had a companion, i wish i had a friend, i wish i could have someone to just listen to myrants, i wish i'd be able to see there emotional, and physical reactions to this. I'm turning into a cyborg, half man, half machine.Of course this is all just adream because in Reality my wishes would never come true, helli'll never be with anyone in the future, at this rate i'm going to be single for the rest of my life...you're thinking (well duh with that attitude) but i've tried the positive attitude that hasnt worked, now asi sink deeper and deeper into a depression i think, "Why Me?"....
