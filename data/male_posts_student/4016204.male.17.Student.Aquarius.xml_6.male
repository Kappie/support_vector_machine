Recently I've been playing a song I just wrote a lot.  I think I'm going to call it "More Than I've Got."  Its basically about how nothing in the world will really make me happy.  I thought I'd post a little excerpt.  Maybe someday it will be on a cd.  Here's the most random and, I hope, slightly funny part of the lyrics, coming from the last part of the second verse:         Wouldn't it be fun                                                   To meet the American President                                    To give him my autograph                           Ask how he's been since I've seen him last
