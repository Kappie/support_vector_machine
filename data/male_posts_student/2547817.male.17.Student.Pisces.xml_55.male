Poor girl.  She was cold over dinner and even let out a "YEAH RIGHT" when the topic of boys treating girls well came up.. Miss Luah and I spoke on the way home and she told me that if I felt she was the one, I should wait. WHICH, dear reader, I've already concluded.  I've left FISH (My Sunday school class). Am not especially close to anyone there anymore, and hence, I'm not under any obligation to stay. Not growing there.  Desiree tells me to move on though optimism may be nice, coz it'll only last for so long. She questions its possible "one-sidedness". I think, while my love may be unrequited, that's how it is in fairytales too. I will wait coz I think she's the one. Which in itself is questionable coz I haven't dated anyone else yet. She is the one person I look forward to meeting every night online. I shan't say more lest you think I'm falling in love with you love.   Reader, reader, reader, you must be getting tired of my love and thoughts about Zel. Too Damn Bad. It's MY blog and I'll bloody white what I wish, Nevertheless, I think it's time I started something fresh. So keep checking for new and exciting updates which will engage you more (I hope).  P.S. My daily blogging schedule will probablly be hampered by my new routine. I get tired easily now. ACJC is not a forgiving place. Goodnight.
