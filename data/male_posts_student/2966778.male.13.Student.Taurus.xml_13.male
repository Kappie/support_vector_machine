(The ones who actually visited this blog.)  There is a chance that I will have internet access.  But it's pretty slim.  There aren't many people with internet, probably because it costs a bit too much.  If I do get the chance, I'll write.  If not, I'll keep a manual blog, i.e. paper and pencil.  Anyway, please keep reading my blog!
