Dear Hilary- I would call you, but I dont think i have your number. I want to hangout with you though, because it will be oh so much fun. perhaps i will get your number from vanessa. or perhaps you should give me your phone number on here or at my email adress. sportsspart6@muchomail.com  -Neil  i am really excited. the drive in. plus neil. plus miriam. = good good times. oh and of course..HP3 is always a bonus.    let the good times ....ROLL.  thats a ten-four soldier. over and out.
