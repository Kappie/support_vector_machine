Its name is Hackers Against America (HAA) and their web site is hosted on a Russian server. According to what is written on the main page, they plan to integrate new members and launch attacks against computers based in the US (cracking some of them but also use worms, viruses) in order to steal private documents. Some samples of documents and codes are available on the web site, although they don't seem to be secret at all and possible to find by using search engines."
