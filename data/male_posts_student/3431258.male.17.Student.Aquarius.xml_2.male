Gave me a lot of adware at first, so i uninstalled and saw it was a selection in the install. Everything works fine now, cool new features!   I had some issue with the plug-ins(Yes,  Msn messenger  plus now supports various plug-ins) for  Winamp .I decided to uninstall them after some major bugs in my music player. Gave some suggestions on how to improve  Soldat  in the official forums yesterday. I received the following feedbacks today."Shut up you Bitch" and stuff of the same kind. It's sad to see that a lot of  Soldat  players are idiots...   Well that's all, guess i'll play some more  Soldat , i really tought about registering the game, it would greatly help.
