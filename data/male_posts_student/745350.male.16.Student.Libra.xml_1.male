I also met a guy on broadway who was friends with Marshall Pailet (I did a show with him in NYC when I was 12).   I met some really amazing people. There's Sam, she's so great and soooo wild haha. And Melissa is the nicest person in the world. My dad and her mom talk all the time now at class, it's cool. Maura is so hott, Umbach girls are craZy and Robin, is just Robin. Sara, Sam, Melissa and everyone, we're all going to see Rent... yes!
