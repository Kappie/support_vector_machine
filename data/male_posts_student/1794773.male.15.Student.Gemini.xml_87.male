I'm so sad that you might not be able to come... but that's still a maybe right?  So you might be able to come.  We were maybe thinking about not making it scary movie night... so I don't know.  If we have just a regular ole happy night we can watch the scary movies later.   Oh, but then Rachael would actually be able to come and we'd watch scary stuff  Oh Shoot!!!  I don't know.  I'll let Nicole figure all this out.  It's her party.  We still have to invite Krista, Becca, and Kristin.  Geesh!!!    Okay, Rachael's was really fun!!!  I am so tired right now.  We got back from church and I just wanted to crash on the couch and sleep.  Carissa or Kristin when is our first practice???  I really don't want to miss it.     Okay I've written enough.  It's gonna take all day to publish this bad boy.  Luv ya guys!!!
