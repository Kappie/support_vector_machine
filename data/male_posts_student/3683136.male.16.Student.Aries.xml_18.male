After long talks with Simon and Sarah on Tuesday night, I think I'm ready for a little publicly posted self-analysis.  So prepare for a self-esteem lowering fest.  There are a lot of things I really don't like about myself.  I think that most of the things Sarah said were at least to some extent true.  I am controlling.  I constantly think I know what's best for people.  And often, I'll do things that are horribly stupid and mean for the purposes of getting my way.  And it sucks about me.  My opinion is not worth more than everyone else's.  I don't have life experiences that make me better or wiser than others.  No matter what I'd like to think.  I'm also excessively dismissive.  I often don't listen to what other people have to say.  While I don't think sarah was right about our evening chats though... I think I did learn a lot about her.  But I think she is right about some of the times that I hang out with others.  I noticed it tonight even... I'm constantly mocking people because of what they do.  It's really shitty of me.  I need to work on that.  I need to work on not being such a bitch all the time.  It's definitely one of my worst qualities.  I'm sooooo critical.  I think I put my foot in my mouth a lot, and to compensate for it I try to bring down others.  It sucks, it makes me feel bad, it makes others feel bad.  I've always been kind of aware of this stuff.  I think that's why I feel like a pariah sometimes.  I definitely can sense when people are not liking me.  And it sucks because it makes me react by becoming more of an ass.  This is why I hate myself.  But at least I can recognize it.  (Note: Addendum, added several hours later)  Admission and acceptance are the first steps to change, or so they say.  I'm kind of glad I got this all out of my system, for a lot of reasons.  I was really offended when sarah told me all of this.  The fact that I heard it from someone else helped me to accept it in a lot of ways.  I've always known that I'm a pushy asshole type, but maybe I can change that.  Like Simon said, maybe this is the kind of learning experience he had.  I mean, I guess I've always been an advocate of the sort of "tough love" approach.  I think this may have been the wake up call that I needed.  I guess we'll have to see.  -Mike  You float like a feather, in a beautiful world, I wish I was special, you're so fuckin special.  but I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo, what the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here.
