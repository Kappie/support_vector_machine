So, awhile back, a friend of mine asked another friend of mine to that Sadee Hawkens dance.  We will call them Girl 1 and Guy.  Anyway,  another friend, Girl 2, tells me that she has liked Guy 1 for God knows how long.  So, naturally, I see it as the classic, two girls after one guy, and it doesn't seem that important.  Flash forward a week or two (or three, anyone's guess).  I get up to school, early release, feeling okay, though I had the remince of a killer headache from the night before.  Anyway, so I get up to school, and apparently Girl 2's whole "secret" got out, and for some reason, Girl 1 was really pissed off at her.  Something about wanting to be a seat buddy with Guy.  Now, Guy doesn't like Girl 1, and has told her that, and that seemed to make everything worse.  They talked it over, Girl 1 and Girl 2, and made up.  Is it just me, or is this something that didn't need to be enlarged like it was?  Dunno, might just be me.  -  In other news, early release was thwarted by the fact that I had to put up with a five hour band festival.  -  And in relation to being sick yesterday, three things happened.    Number 1, while the class corrected the quiz they took yesterday, Sara, Jill, and I got to sit out in the hall and talk the whole period.  Not a bad deal, better than doing spanish I say.  Number 2, Cranny didn't really care that I was gone yesterday in the relation to the project that was due (Which I had finished on Friday of last week).  Which brings me to...  Number 3, Mrs. Klaas wen't super bitch on me today, claiming I skipped class because the persuasive paper was due, which is total crap, seeing I did it on Monday night.  But, you know, Uber bitch Santa wives will be Uber bitch Santa wives, I say.
