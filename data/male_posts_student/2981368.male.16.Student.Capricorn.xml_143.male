And now theres only one exam left this week...if you can even call it an exam. Its more like...2 hours of crap. Yes, its the RE exam.   In other news, I'm gonna get back into the routine of writing parody songs. Ideas I've had so far include:  "Be Like That" (god knows) -> "Be Like Mat" or "Be Like Nat" "Into the West" (god knows) -> "Into the South West" (Bristol etc) "Politik" (Coldplay) -> "Politics"  I also wanna do parodies of: "Heavy" (Collective Soul) "Spanish Flea" (god knows) "Wherever you will go" (The Calling)  Send suggestions and ideas to the usual address...
