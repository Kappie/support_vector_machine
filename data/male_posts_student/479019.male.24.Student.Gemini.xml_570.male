I need to be more productive! 12 days left in CA!  Probably gonna do something today as a send off for Naomi N.  Naomi R. is leaving for Europe end of next week I think... so that means the girls and I will probably do something. I need to go out for a beer with Alex also.  Naomi N. commented on how I have a lot of friends and I do a pretty good job of keeping in touch with 'em all. I guess I do... that's probably why I've been out drinking every night this week! Or chatting online instead of writing.  The upcoming school year should be good in that lots of people will be visiting. Andy will be visitin in Sept. I'll probably head down to visit Nai, Cissa, and Mike in Oct. then Janet and Julia will be visiting in March. Possibly Steff in November.  I've been listening to  Circle Jerks  and  Pistol Grip  lately.   ***
