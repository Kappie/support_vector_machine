My mom is temporarily keepin my cell phone until i am responsible again...w/e that meanz. So i guess im not gonna have a phone for a while. Well today i went to practice wit the girlz, so i can keep myself and top vball shape i suppose. I had to help the girlz over at the soph/frosh court...i had to teach them how to dive and do slides and sumo-passing. Thus proving that i am not a true coach i suppose, i was jus like "ok...now watch how i do it...now u do it" haha. But tomorrow should b a very very good day...im suppose to go to david's b-day party wit steph...then after that, we're goin to the movies and watch spiderman 2...then maybe after that, some sparkz will fly...=)...hehe...and yeah...hope i dont screw this up...payce out
