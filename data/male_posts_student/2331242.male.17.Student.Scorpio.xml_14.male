We basically managed to pry the Document Based Question out of him at the review session, so I was well prepared for that part. As for the 60 multiple choice, I guess I felt confident about them (wow, isn't that an oxymoron?). We'll see what happens... last time I felt confident about something in that class he handed me back an 'R' for Rewrite. Oh well. The next exam is AP American Lit. on monday, and I'm in a similar predicament... except there isn't a 5 hour review session to bail me out. Coupled with the fact that I haven't really read.... all.... year..... yeah...........   LESSONS AND CAROLS  ...is a music/scripture thing, as you might be able to tell by the title, that my church is doing this Saturday and Sunday. I play handbells and sing (falalalala-lala-la-la). Last night, a few boneheads didn't know where to go to sing, so that was ugly. Other than that though, not a bad performance. The second one is tonight, so maybe it'll go smoother.   MARTHA  As I promised her, we went out to lunch together on Saturday. I picked her up at 12:30 and we went to the Subway just down the street. That took about 30 minutes, and I had to be home by 2:30. Not knowing what else to do, we drove across town to South Park and just walked around the mall for a while. When we got back in the car to leave, she told me I owed her a kiss, and I happily obliged... for like 10 minutes :) After the last one, Martha looked out of the window and there was this old couple just staring at us, eyes wide and mouths hanging open. We both started laughing uncontrollably, and I hid behind the steering wheel. I dunno, Martha keeps telling me not to freak out if I don't know them, but I mean these people were like five feet away! Heheh, looking back on it it's kinda funny.   NEWS FLASH!  So Saddam's been captured? Rock on. It's about time we had a little success over there. One more reason for me not to study english ^_^   P.S. to Martha: Love is the highest form of trust ;)
