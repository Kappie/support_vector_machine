(Damnit, they know my horrible secret)   And because you guys asked for it, it's the RANDOM AARON SORKIN QUOTE OF THE MINUTE!  "What are you, nuts? Are you just some... nutty-nut girl who's nuts?" -- Dan Rydell  (Sports Night)   Gee, wonder who THAT could be talking about?   Do you guys know who Philo Farnsworth was?  He invented television.  I don't mean he invented television like Uncle Milty, I mean he invented the television. In a little house in Provo, Utah.  At a time when the idea of transmitting moving pictures through the air would be like me saying I've figured out a way to beam us aboard the Starship Enterprise. He was a visionary and he died broke and without fanfare.  The guy I really like though was his brother-in-law, Cliff Gardner.  He said to Philo, "I know everyone thinks you're crazy, but I want to be a part of this.  I don't have your head for science, so I'm not gonna be much help with the design and mechanics of the invention.  But it sounds like in order to do your  testing, you're gonna need glass tubes." See Philo was inventing a cathode receptor, and even though Cliff didn't know what that meant or how it worked, he'd seen Philo's drawing and he knew they were gonna need glass tubes and since television hadn't been invented yet, it's not like you could get 'em at the local TV repair shop. "I want to be a part of this", Cliff said, "and I don't have your head for science.  How would it be if I taught myself to be a glassblower?  And I could set up a little shop in the  backyard. And I could make all the tubes you'll need for testing." There oughta be Congressional medals for people like that!   Everybody's favorite lawnboy, Brandon
