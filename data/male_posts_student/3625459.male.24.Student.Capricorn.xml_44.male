Want to leave this place behind, I guess I’m still here because of Angel. I just want her to be on her own two feet. Cwill be able to manage she'shappier when I’m not around. I wonder how my parents are doing too. My mums probably missing me. I wonder if I’m gonna be showered with kisses when i get back home.    Dave’s online, just sent him a quick hi message.He's doing well. [that was an hour and a half ago , no reply yet form Dave] . Yeah I know how much I’m worth. This was from some one who once said that I’m putting up my price.    Why is it that i crave forfriends and a little recognition?Why is it that I don’t have any real friends. Even back in b'lore ,I always was with Dave none of the others cared. Most of them were hi -bye. Never had any serious relationships or friends. Dave was an odd ball, I guess we were together because he wanted the life that I had (seclusive and where no one took notice of me) and i wanted toe life that he had where everyone knew him and he had somany friends.    I sometimes wonder if i live in my head. Like Curt Cobain sang “I found God he was in my head". For me its more like, I foundfriends they arein my head. I guess i just want to belong. Been watching reality shows, and I’m beginning to wonder will a person like me ever really have any friends. leave alone love.I mean how some one can love some one who's not good-looking. Beauty is skin deep. Watching "Average Joe" yesterday, yes I was god smacked. Realizing how ugly i am. Every one picks some one who's good looking. People like me just exist, no matter how much we try and how we are, we don’t get far ahead in life. We are the guys who are picked on, shunned upon; we’re the average Joe’s. Nerds, dweebs, that’s. I still remember getting picked by Rajeev, Sachin, Gautam Menda, was i ever really accepted. Even in Christ College I used to be called crazy, was it my fault for trying too hard for being accepted?    Tears for remembrance and tears for joy  Tears for somebody and this lonely boy
