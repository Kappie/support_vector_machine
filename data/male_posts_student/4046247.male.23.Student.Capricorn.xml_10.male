Coupled with reports of massive, government-organized protests in Khartoum, Sudan against the prospect of American intervention in Darfour (see  urlLink http://www.lemonde.fr/web/recherche_articleweb/1,13-0,36-374543,0.html ), this headline does not paint an agreeable picture of religious and ethnic tolerance in the Arab world.       Also very troubling, and the subject of an editorial in yesterday´s New York Times available at  urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/04/opinion/04wed1.html , is the chilling and undeniable fact that Iran´s theocratic leadership appears to be actively pursuing a nuclear weapons program.  Diplomatic attempts by Britain, Germany, and France (whose previous foreign minister and current interior minister, Dominique de Villepin, confidently proclaimed that his approach to the Iranian question was a saner and more effective model than Bush´s Iraq policy) have consistently been frustrated by the ruling clerics. They are fully aware that near-universal condemnation of the war in Iraq has greatly, if not completely, reduced the probability of any ultimate and decisive -- and by that, I mean military -- action being taken against them.         Why are so many individuals who were extraordinarily vocal in their defense of the Iraqi people, and in their condemnation of the American intervention, now ghastly silent -- not agape! -- in the face of the outrages being committed against Iraqi Christians and Sudanese?  Does the prospect of a nuclear Iran not frighten them?         I have a theory about the double standard:      It is out of ignorance, apathy, ideology, or conscious design, that people around the world turn a blind eye to much troubling news from the Middle East. To some, "Bush´s" war is the crux of our terrorist problem, the catalyst for fundamentalism, the grave, imperialist injustice  par excellence .  We are talking about the kind of people who, in the 1980´s, from the comfort of their Western Europeans salons, howled against the Reagan deployment of missiles in West Germany. Resentment of the United States, envy, and literary idealizations of socialism, were allowed to cloud over and obfuscate the harsh realities of life behind the Iron Curtain. Think of all the French intellectuals who, until the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia and, in a few cases, even after it, towed the Moscow line.      We cannot allow a similar development -- the furtherance of the ridiculous notion (propogated by people who really should know better, like the excellent, Nobel-Prize winning Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago, whom I once had the pleasure of meeting, and who later called George W. Bush the greatest threat to world peace today) that mistakes made by President Bush and crimes committed by Islamic fundamentalists, Saddam Hussein, or Omar el-Bashir are all morally equivalent -- to take root and PARALYZE US. Yes, I am sounding the alarm!      We have to clearly address the threats to religous freedom and human rights, as well as the abuses perpetrated by radical fundamentalist governments in the Middle East (this doesn´t meant that the answers are always, or even predominantly, military). And, while there is a pressing need for an equitable solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, along the lines of the peace attempted by Presidents Carter and Clinton, we cannot permit this quagmire to distract from and foil, discussions of other problems in neighboring countries.
