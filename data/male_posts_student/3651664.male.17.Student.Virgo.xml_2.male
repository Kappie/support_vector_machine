His biographer, Douglas Brinkley, who has access to his personal journals, says he was simply  urlLink "mistaken."  He was fifty miles from Cambodia on Christmas Eve. Whoops. So he's in Vietnam for four months, doesn't even finish his first tour, and wants to be elected based on his "experience."  Some interesting facts about Kerry and Vietnam: All three of his Purple Heart awards were for wounds that required a band-aid; He carried a typewriter and movie camera with him to Vietnam to document his exploits and re-enact war scenes for his political career; His photograph is hanging in a place of honor in a communist Vietnamese museum in Saigon; Captured Americans were tortured in North Vietnamese prisons for not endorsing his false testimony before the US Senate about alleged war crimes.  That's just a few. To learn the whole truth about John Kerry and Vietnam, read the book  urlLink "Unfit for Command"  by John O'Neill and Jerome Corsi when it comes out on the 15th.  Thanks to Sean for the tip.
