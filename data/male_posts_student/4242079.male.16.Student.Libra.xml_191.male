I haven't played that horrible since those days hanging out with Tammy and Chris and Eddie in junior high. I even managed to knock my ball off of the table, and onto the table next to us, where some whorish looking girls were playing with some loser guys. You know...the "hollywood" type, who wear their sunglasses everywhere. Yes. It didn't even seem like they noticed, but we all busted a gut. Heh.  Next topic. Dayv. Seemingly, an amazing girl. Seemingly, our personalities seem to be very compatible. Seemingly. Seemingly. God Damn SEEMINGLY. heh. I'm done now. I know, I'm not allowed to talk about girls anymore, because it seems like every time I talk about them, they disapear. Not that it's their fault either. Usually, it's mine. I just push people away a lot when they start to get close. But she can't get close, so maybe that's...I don't know. Geography is a great thing sometimes, terrible at others. Ahem. Little of this paragraph makes sense, so...moving on.  I bought the Spitafield disc the other day. They were one of the bands at the Billy Talent concert, and I didn't really like them then. But for some reason, the CD at HMV just jumped out at me, and I bought it. Well, I haven't stopped listening to it since then. Today alone I listented to it 14 times. (I didn't count, it's simple math based on minutes i was at work and the length of the CD). It's AMAZING!  I LOVE IT!  heh. well. good night.
