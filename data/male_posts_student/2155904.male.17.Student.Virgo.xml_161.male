Tyke got up at 10 today and played ESPN until he got called by Amed to play some bball at Cougar Ridge at 1.  So he left for that and he, Amed, and Dr. Phil played like 5 games of 21.  Dr. Phil won the first game but Tyke won every other one.  One game he won by only giving up 2 total points the whole game while he scored 21.  It was cool.  The games got cut a little short due to poop.  Tyke picked up a frisbee that was just laying there and chucked it but noticed afterwards that there was dog crap all over his hands.  So he wiped some on the ball without telling either player and then as Doc P began to notice Tyke was already using Amed as a napkin for some of the rest of it.  When Tyke went to box out Amed on a rebound he wiped his hand down the sleeve of Amed and left a nice little mark of it.  It was hilarious.  Then they went to Doc P's and looked at the new Lexus and changed and washed up.  Then they found Here I Am to Worship on Doc's computer after about 5 minutes of looking for it while Amed called the cop from the "incident" on Saturday.  But his dad wouldn't let him go to court so Amed can't.  However, they decided they wanted to see a movie so Amed went home to change and met Tyke and Dr. Phil at Factoria where they saw Walking Tall.  It was hella short.  84 minutes is how long it is supposed to be but really it was like an hour and 15 minutes.  Hella short.  It wasn't bad but it was pretty predictable and not very developed.  But The Rock is sick so that made it good.  It is chuckle-funny.  On occasions you will chuckle but it isn't like a funny movie.  Just an action-flick.  For the price of a matinee it wasn't too bad.  Don't watch it at night for it would be a ripoff then.  Anyway, the three studs went to Macaroon's house and played Mario Party for over an hour before Maniak and DUI came over for a few games.  Then everyone split and the day was over.  Tyke picked up some BK on the way home and ate that but really he didn't do much.  He texted Purdy to see if she was busy but she was and everyone else Tyke could think of was busy too.  So he had the second night this week where he didn't do anything.  Not exactly a fun night.  Tyke doesn't quite have the sanity to be able to take many of these kind of nights.  In other words, when Tyke has a night where he wants to be doing something but he doesn't, he gets down and lonesome.  So he is going to go stop that by watching a movie and eating some ice cream.  By himself.  Bye.
