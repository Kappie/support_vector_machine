District 833 sucks almost as bad as homework-we haven't had a snowday since the damned first grade, and we should have had one yesterday. But did we...? NO. There's somewhere around 1.5 to 2 feet of snow on the ground, and school isn't cancelled. I think there's something wrong with that-we deserved a day off.  Recap of the time I didn't blog: Friday: I went over to Dan's place and played Magic/Halo with him and Josh for the evening. Saturday: I cleaned the whole damn house, did homework, and took my last resort for a Saturday nightlife-the Underground. It's gettin' kinda lame right now-I guess not as many people are going. Or maybe it's just me wishing I was able to do something better than that. Sunday: I didn't go to church because of the snow, so I decided to go skiing all day-not a good idea, since I had to do all the shoveling too. To keep it simple, my back still hurts. Monday: Jazz band, along with all other after-school activities were cancelled, leaving me more time to not do my homework, and to avoid studying the Social test. In other words, my drum lesson and homework ruled my night. Tuesday: Not nearly as much homework, but I don't know who I'm going to take to the Ice Palace tonight, if I'm going. And hey-guess what. Valentine's day means nothing to me this year-it never really has, and I don't think it will anytime soon.  Random Spanish funny of the day: Mrs. Sustic decides to read Nathaniel's paragraph on the places to see in the city of Mexico. Of course, the paragraph is a bunch of random crap, literally. Needless to say, it was pretty damn funny.  Now this is the kind of winter weather I love. We actually have snow, and the skiing is hellafun in fresh powder too. The other night when it was snowing, I was thinking how much I'd like to have someone to enjoy all this with. Oh wait-I'm dreaming again.
