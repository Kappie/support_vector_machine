Playing as much disc golf as possible on Memorial Day weekend had become a tradition of mine, as there's nothing I enjoyed better than driving between courses with the 97X WOXY Modern Rock 500 Countdown on the radio.  Unfortunately, since 97X is no more, something felt like it was missing this year.  Anyhow, Nick and I play a round of disc golf out at Winton Woods.  Unfortunately, the cicadas were so bad that they were almost deafening in certain parts.  And then they were swarming like no other in a few areas.  Believe it or not, my ears were actually ringing like they do when I leave a concert.  Needless to say, we quit after one round because of the cicadas.  I managed to shoot (-7) for the round despite no birdies on the first 7 holes.    Started working on my final homework assignment of my college career tonight.  Would have had the sucker finished had it not be that I am stuck on a few parts.  Looks like I'll have to finish that up tomorrow during the day.  I also cannot wait to get this damn IDS project presentation out of the way on Friday.  Lemme say, this project sucks.
