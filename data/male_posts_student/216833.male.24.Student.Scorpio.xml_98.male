This week has been nothing but:  6:30am - wake up and get dressed. 7:30am - start my day at work 11:30am- work out in the gym 1pm - go to lunch 4pm - leave from work and drive to school 7:30pm - leave from school on my way home for food and tv 10 or 11 - lay down and go to sleep  This weeks blubs in this routine were as follows:  Monday - same Tues. - same Wedn. - no school/found apartment/went swimming/bought new undies Thurs. - 7:30pm drove to Ft.Worth to install PCs at FWD Ballet office - get home at 2am( I am very tired!) Friday - we will see!!!   I know there are a few things I need to do today. I probably won't be going up to school. I hope the guy from Brady, tx(whom purchased the Time Killers arcade) shows up tonight to get his system. Later tonight I will have to move stuff over to nicks for our garage sale in the morning. I need to pick up some signs, also, around 3pm tommorrow I am meeting the guy who bought the Mortal Kombat - I hopefully will have some money this weekend - that will help make the move easier. I sold my bass on ebay. I feel kinda shitty about it - it's just stuff. I can live in a box and be ok physically - maybe not mentally. I don't like needing stuff. :(  Come to the garage sale and buy some of my old stuff.  Do I have anything going on this Sunday - it doesn't look like it. OH! I have to watch my little sister on Saturday night. I need to tell mimi hahahaha.   current mood:  tired current music: Shotmaker - Now and Then    This is where I am moving!  If the circus comes to Rohnert Park, it can send in the clowns, but it will have to keep most of the animals in their cages. In a mostly symbolic gesture, the Rohnert Park City Council passed a law backed by a local animal rights group that prohibits the display of wild and exotic animals such as elephants, lions and tigers for entertainment or amusement. Violators would be fined a thousand dollars and jailed up to six months. Members of Sonoma People for Animal Rights urged the council to pass the law. They claim traveling circus animals are often confined and chained up to 23 hours a day.
