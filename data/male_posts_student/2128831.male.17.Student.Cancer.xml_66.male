I've never won at Monopoly before, so I take the Chicken-shit route of playing against a three year-old. And I kicked her ASS! Ended up owning everything but three "properties" (in this case, dog breeds) and cashed out at $9,426. She had about $30 left. And yes, I am gloating. In front of my charge. I wanted to show her what the real world is like.  Just finished watching a classic Simpsons episode, where Homer has only one day left to live. He spends his last day listening to Lisa play the sax, records a video for Maggie, goes fishing and plays catch with his father, has a final drink with his friends at Moe's, and is intimate with Marge. [Among the other things Homer wanted to do but didn't have time to were: Tell off his boss, go hangliding, and plant a tree.]   After Marge falls asleep, Homer sneaks downstairs and falls asleep while listening to the Bible on tape, as read by Larry King, in front of a window looking out into the night. When morning comes, Marge realizes Homer's drool is still warm and implores him to wake up. When Homer realizes he's alive, he vows from that day forward he'll live his life to the fullest.   The very next day, Homer is seen sitting on the couch eating Pork Rinds Light while watching bowling on TV.   If I had one day left to live, here's how I think I'd spend it: 1. Watch the sun rise over the desert valley with Riley. 2. Have a talk with my best friends, Thomas, Megan, Sam, Riley, Damien, and Jared over breakfast about how proud I am of them and that I'll be watching over them, always. 3. Go skydiving and hangliding 4. Have lunch with my closest friends at the top of a mountain and thank them for the gift of friendship, all the fond memories created over the years, and for accepting me despite my shortcomings. I'd let them know how proud I was of them and perhaps leave them with a reminder that they have the opportunity to truly make the most of the time they have left to do everything it is they ever dreamed of. I'd reassure them to not be afraid to fail. Then I'd sneak off alone to admire the nature. I'd try to calm my fears by soaking in the serenity emanating from the trees, the animals, the sun, and the crisp mountain air while being humbled at the realization of my small place in this world. 5. I'd hit up a bling-bling boutique and max out my credit card to buy my stepmom an extravagant dress. She's a thrifty shopper and would feel guilty if she ever bought anything too lavish, since she's always been the family budgeteer. I remember her having to go to her nephew's wedding in Hawaii a few years back and feeling ashamed that she didn't have anything to wear. She hadn't bought a dress in over twenty years. Everything  formal in her closet was from the eighties. I swore that the first thing I'd buy her, once I had enough money, was a beautiful dress. One that she could be proud to wear. 6. Sit my father down and talk to him. Truly talk to him about everything (which would require me to duct tape his mouth). All my adventures; all my dreams. I'd leave no stone unturned. I'd let him know that I understood why he was never around when we were growing up, although at the time I hated him for it. I never had a father to throw a baseball around with, to talk with about bois, learn how to shave or how to properly tie a tie, and all those other coming-of-age things you're supposed to learn from a father. But what I did have was a father who loved me very much. I guess deep down inside I've always known that. And that was better than a person to play catch with. I would  tell him that I loved him. And that I would always be proud to call him my old man. 7. I'd watch the sunset beyond the Pacific Ocean from The Cliffs in San Diego. Then make my peace and myself. 8. I'd have dinner with my family at home, all of them just like any other night, except on this night we'd turn off the TV and we'd truly listen to one another.  9. Make time to listen to a few of my favourite songs one last time: Four to the Floor- Starsailer, So Disco- Sensuous, It’s Written in the Stars- Paul Weller, My Beautiful Friend- Charlatans, Ay Ay- Two Face, and for my baby Riley, well really most are for him, The Life of Riley- The Lightening Seeds    10. And, if I were lucky enough, I'd spend my last precious hours on this earth with the one I loved and bang him like there's no tomorrow (which there wouldn't be) then simply watch each other and drift off to sleep cradling him. *My last request would be to have my body cremated and have my ashes scattered over the Pacific Ocean. Most of these aren't anything too elaborate. But I think they're simple things that would make me happy as I finish out my time here.  [w]ri[t]ers on the storm- A lil’ bit of Will’s mind breaking off, watch out when falling for 50 stories it might hurt a tid bit!  Ummm, yeah! The backdrop: A rainy day. Mix in some light snow and a little scotch and you have a Tuesday afternoon in New York City. The mood changes as Jim Croce somberly spews forth a hint of melancholy into his small, but cozy studio. Thoughts of Manhattan are reduced to clam chowder and bustling subway stations. His attention is caught by a face that seems vaguely familiar. His gaze had very likely been inquisitive and tactless; for he became suddenly conscious that the stranger was returning it, and indeed so directly, with such hostility, such plain intent to force the withdrawal of the other's eyes, that he felt an unpleasant twinge and turned away from the mirror.  What was it that was stirring inside him, causing him to lose precious hours of sleep? Perhaps what he felt was no more than a longing to travel; yet coming upon him with such suddenness and passion as to resemble a seizure, almost a hallucination. This yearning for new and distant scenes, this craving for freedom, release, forgetfulness - they were, he admitted to himself, an impulse towards flight, flight from the spot which was the daily theatre of a rigid, cold, and dispassionate toil.
