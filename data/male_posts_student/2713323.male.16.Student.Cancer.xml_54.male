Hmm...woke up at 3am in the morning because of the loud noize that was coming from the hall. my dad was screaming the shit out of my sis and vice versa. i have to idea what they were going on about but i sure heard a stream of vulgarities and dialects. i heard things getting smashed, and i smelt perfume, which i later found out that a bottle of it broke, cos my dad threw my sis's handbag, chasing her out of the house. my maid told me i missed an interesting drama show, she said that my sis took a knife from the kitchen and told my pop to stay away from her while she left. interesting life huh? i've got a screwed up family, thank god im not :P. hmmm...now my sis is in her room with her friend sleeping with the door closed, my dad is in his room doing god knows what, with the door closed, and im in my room writing this, with my door closed. wondered how did she come back? its raining now, i woke up at 7.10 in the morning, had to go for clb which in the end did not exist at all. damn jeremy fooled all of us. wasted trip. so we ended up chating at macs and waited till 10am before getting breakfast and heading over to her place. when i was heading home after dropping off breakfast, i did some thinking with the coffee. i vowed never to chase my kid out of the house, scold him because he is not academically inclined and take away his freedom. his? hmm...yep, his, cos i hope it would'nt be a girl. :D. Oh yeah, for you guys who don't really know me that well, my dad is 62 and he, i believe and that my mum,sis and maid believe, is getting more and more crazy day by day ; suffering from one of those side effects of ageing. ima from a single parent family, and i live in the ghettos of inserttherandomstateorstreetorcountryname. the pic above is a pic of my dad, when he was young, does kinda bear a strange resemblence to me huh. oh, its raining now, my lunch is ready, maybe if im really bored later i'll come up with drawing or something. hmm.
