If you don’t know who The Dead are they are the original members of The Greatful Dead, just without Jerry Garcia. Okay, FRIGGIN’ AWESOME!!!!! It was unbelievable! They rocked! The crowd, the band, the celebration, all cool!  The Crowd - Great! It’s like a traveling circus. Imagine a place where everyone is wearing goofy hats, tidye shirts, smoking pot, and blurting out the most random shit ever; my friend, you’re at The Dead concert. It’s great, everyone there was smoking pot. My dad and I were probably the only people there not smoking dope. In fact, the t-shirt that I bought there smells like pot. I almost feel like not washing it. And during the concert, there was this guy who went around the arena multiple times juggling like 6 glow-up balls. And the crowd is wearing glow sticks around their necks and arms. The people there are all like one big family, except they’re all high.  Robert Hunter - Real good. He played a good hour long set. He came out with this big-white Gibson Classic Reissue guitar, said hello and started. He played some cool songs. None of them I really knew, but Robert Hunter, I think, wrote some songs for The Greatful Dead. Pretty cool, huh? All and all, he was really good.  Motown - Really . . . uh . . . how shall I say it; cool. They’re were actually the back-up band for all the Motown groups like The Supremes, The Temptations, and Marvin Gaye. In fact, they have the most hits in the world, even more than The Beatles and Rolling Stones combined! And one of the chicks from the band has around 80 gold records. Amazing, eh? Anyways, they’re all in their 70s and there were 7 of the 16 original members. They’re all black and they wore these red suits. They were very good. They performed great songs like The Supremes’ “Stop in the Name of Love,” Marvin Gaye’s “What’s Going On,” ect. Totally cool! They set was a good hour and a half long, but it was worth it.   Midnight - After a while the lights went out. Then an amazing light show began. It was like a friggin’ JLo video. Then this hug space ship floated to the stage then back across the arena. At first it seemed lame nothing happened after. Then, all was quiet, until the 10 Count started. As we cleared our throats to say the word "ten" there were these two guys hitting a hug drum for every second. As one was finished, BOOM! The jungle of balloons and confide fell on us. There was probably 2000 balloons. Then The Dead ripped into Sugar Magnolia.    The Dead - ABSOLUTLYUNFRIGGIN’BELIEVABLE!!!!! They were the greatest!!! If there's a concert this year that was the best; it was this one! Again; UNBELIEVABLE!!! We've got finger-rambling guitar of Bob Weir, and the scary-low bass of Phil Lesh that make this concert wonderful. As for the new guitarist, well, not that bad. Y'know, its hard replacing a guy like Jerry Garcia, but this guy did an okay job. But he was a little bit more heavy and loud as Garcia. Still the concert was off-the-friggin'-hook! Right as 12 midnight came they performed Sugar Magnolia. They did a lot of songs I don't recognize, but they didn't play Darkstar. It would have been cool because they've only played Darkstar in concert only like 5 times. It would've been cool though.   My Grade - Totally great bands. Robert Hunter - **** because he did long songs. Plus I didn’t know much about him. That Motown Band - ****1/2 because their performance was a little too long. The Dead - *****! AWESOME. If there’s one show you wanna go to, see The Dead!   P.S. Sorry for the delay.
