I mean I tried going to UCC....but absolutely had no will.....I had no will to even pick up the phone and call people to chill. Yeah today....was laziness at its worst.....took MANY bullets of laziness today. Guess there were its upsides though. Drummed so much my arms began to hurt lol. And just had some time to relax, chill out and reflect I guess. Also....I don't know why I was so tired today....interesting.  After playing SC until about 1am (hey you think that's bad Jason was up till 4am on that game) I slept until 10am and then woke up. Had to do some piano practice before lesson. Yeah this week's total practice time: 140 minutes lol. Yeah I'm havin' horrible time with piano practice lately. Oh well...least I'm gettin' stuff done still. Oh yes and I'm still extremely behind in theory lol. Gotta do that too. Right now my list of things to do is somethin' around this area:  -Theory -Math project -Bio Lab -Piano Practice  Yup.....my hectic Easter holiday. Work? Yeah I can't believe I have work this Easter. Saddening I know. Really need to get priorities straight though....*shakes fist* WHY MUST NHL PLAYOFFS BE NOW!? SO MUCH CONFLICT lol. Argh.......always tempted to watch the Leafs being massacred *how'd they shut out Ottawa?* or watch the Avs trample the Stars into pixie dust. Grr......but instead I'm stuck on either Compy or in front of piano.......working away. ARRRRRRGH!!!!!!!!!!!!  Piano lesson: gotta catch up on theory...and my music's going really well. Not much else to say =P. Good playing....crappy theory. Yup......lol. Good old piano.....least I'm doin good at it =P.  Yeah.......my afternoon: VERY BORING. I wanted to sleep...BUT ARGH SO MANY INTERRUPTIONS! PHONE=GAYNESS TO THE MAX. If I only had one I'd unplug the piece of crap..but I'm not about to go hunting for phone cords in my house, nor will I take wire cutters and butcher the wires. Unlike Adrian's mom I'm smart enough to realize not to lol *she cut their cable.......LITERALLY.* So giving up on sleep, went to drum for an hour or so, then SC. Finally assembled enough good people to make it past 40 minutes in Raccoon City. But then.........GAME CRASHED! BLAST! Oh well...only game not like it's a project. I'd punch my towercase *monitor's too pretty......17" LCD =P* if it was a gargantuan project. We talkin' like 50 page essay or something. I'd be REALLY mad. Thank goodness for system recovery lol....and Ctrl+S.....don't know what I'd do without that =P. *coming out of geek mode* I called Age afterwards to come over and chill for a bit. Got further in Silent Hill 3. Yeah 3 of us in that room afterwards....me, Adrian, Jason and we still scared shitless at times lol. It was good times though.......had a few good jokes. Lol some fat monster looks like a Sumo wrestler...and when it deflated when we died.....wow we all just started laughing. Yeah but then found out it was 5:50.....CRAP GOTTA GET LINA FOR HYPE lol. So I quickly took Adrian's bike and jetted my way down to her place lol. WHEW bikes go much faster than walking. After not using one for over a year......yeah underestimated its usefulness lol. So got there in record 5 minutes *NO WAY* and back to house in another 10.....we walked back since she didn't exactly have a bike also. So yeah......HYPE meeting would start soon.  Well by the time I got back......yeah Josh, Becca, Steph, Calvin, Gavin and the Twins would be here also. Brian and others would come afterwards too. Yeah showed some TC vids.....my video blogs haha. Yeah they are pretty interesting......blogging during TC lol....on my camera. Yeah I know it's kinda weird. Actually if one day I can...I wanna set up a video blog for myself. But this will do for now =P. So after everyone got here *Age had to leave but meh* we started our HYPE meeting at my place.  Started off with a bit of singin' led by Steph......then went into Bible Study. Talked about Acts mostly today....and what the Lord left us after leaving for heaven again (Holy Spirit). Also talked about the purpose of Easter holiday too hehe. Hmm........prayer groups got together w/ Gavin, Jason, and Lina. First time leading a group......wow it felt so weird lol. Yeah to think next year Jeff may lead HYPE hahaha. Funny but cool also. To think the dude used to come to Sunday school with us. And Josh may be counselor in two years......yeah far out lol. Unless he going to University...which reminds me JOSH FINALLY LET ME BORROW INFO BOOK! YES! Now to see what my courses are like for university lol. Must choose.......grrr.  Anyways back on topic. So went through some times of sharing.....lol lots of talk about b-ball........Lakers rivalry between Lina and Jason building up already haha. Jason absolutely hates them and Lina loves em haha. Good to see us gettin' to know one another already haha. So prayed, talked a bit and then FOOD! Yeah JT also announced this is his 3rd last HYPE meeting. S'all good though....he still gonna be around....just helpin' out more w/ ACF on campus. Wonder if I can join ACF lol. Wait till I'm a froshie I guess hehe.  So yeah that was basically my lazy day. Sleep, Piano, SC, then HYPE. HYPE meeting was cool though.....jokes, good times, and just gettin' closer with my Bro's n Sis' in Christ.  Well I'm out. Lates. Easter Sunday tomorrow. STEPH'S GETTING BAPTIZED *congrats Steph!* Lol made a fe jokes about that...."QUICK STEPH UNLEASH ALL YOUR ANGER BEFORE THAT HOLY WATER HITS YOU TOMORROW!" Quoted from BK hehe. Or JT's "LET'S ANOINT HER WITH PEPSI!" Lol. Oh yeah and made some jokes about if HYPE had initiation:  "Dear *insert name here,*  But due to the lack of good grades, you have been placed on the HYPE waiting list. Yeah basically we are saying YOU'RE CUT!"  Or the thing about "Ok....so you new? Ok lead the Bible study =P."  All jokes though hehe. Well yeah that's it for the night hehe. Later.
