So he got a call from Tina at 11:30 telling him to come up at noon so he got ready and left. Tyke just realized that this isn't going to be a short and sweet blog most likely. Tyke got to Tina's and waited for Purdy and then they went in and found Tina out back. So they talked a little and Tyke explained his Europe trip to Tina's mom. Tyke and her mom haven't ever talked that much but recently he has been talking to her and Tina's dad a lot more. She even asked Tyke about his Europe trip and he didn't even know she knew he went. Unexpected but delightful. Frederique came over a little later. Then the 4 of them went out on Tina's boat. They laid out in the sun for a while and then Haras came over so they went back and picked her up. Then her and Frederique did a little tubing before Frederique had to go back to the dock and leave. So then it was the 4 of them again and they went back out on the water and laid out more and then just drove around. It was fun and then sun was shining down but it wasn't all that hot so it was nice. After they docked the boat again they went up and laid on the deck for a long time. Then Purdy wanted to go to Redmond Town Center so they did. Nothing like doing girl shopping with 3 girls. Tyke is somehow pretty used to it, even though he doesn't do it that often. They saw Ms. Middleton at the Gap of course. She sure was excited to hear Tyke is going to WSU and also freaked out the gang a little with how planned she was for the year. She knew what games she was going to, where they were at, when they were. Damn, Tyke barely even knows what day he's moving in and she knows everything. They got some Starbucks and looked at stuff and then went back to Tina's. They waited til her brother's friends were gone and then they went out on the boat again. It was funny cuz Fejj was there but he was only there cuz he is rushing at a frat this fall so he was hanging out with some of the frat boys. He and Tyke chatted a little since they haven't really hung out much all this summer. After RTC, Ekul, Gin (Tina's bf), and C-biscuit came over. So they all went out on the boat and tubed some more. It was fun. Tyke is super good at tubing so he can just sit in the tube and comfortably have his body tucked into the hole so it is almost impossible for him to fall. He and Ekul rocked out on the water. But Ekul did it a harder way and did better tricks than Tyke. Tyke just didn't fall out until the last time when his tube flipped sideways. It was a lot of fun though and Tyke hasn't gone tubing in years. He has only gone like 3 times in his life too. After tubing was all done they went back on the deck and then played ping pong and played the guitar and the guys hung out for a little while the girls changed and stuff. Then they came back and Kramm came over for a little while Tyke and Ekul were in the hot tub making up cool new names by changing the vowels in a name to a different vowel. For instance Chris could be changed to Chros (cross) and stuff like that. It is fun with some names. After the hot tub everyone made cookies and ate them. That was fun. Then they didn't really do much for a while and started a movie at about 10:50. Sneakers was the movie. Good movie but Tyke left before it was over. Just because everyone else left and being at someone's house when it is just them and their bf/gf is not fun nor is it always appreciated. So Tyke left, said goodbye to Haras as they left together and then came home. So yeah, if Tyke just said everything he did today it would sound like an awesome day but really it was just pretty good. He did get a little burned and it's a little uncomfortable now but really not that bad. And he has some weird bloody thing on his arms but the blood didn't break the surface nor did it ever hurt. So basically it's just weird looking. That's from tubing. But really it's just the day was sorta depressing. Cuz after this year Tyke really thinks his friends will be totally different and he will already have lost touch with some very close current friends. And for a while this year at least, Tyke will still have pain cuz he can't just forget. The surroundings will remind him and his friends will too. So it won't be easy to start over. But it has to get better than the current. This summer Tyke has either played poker, bowled, or been with the girls and their bf's. That is almost everything he has done. The latter is the most disappointing. Living on the outside looking in.
