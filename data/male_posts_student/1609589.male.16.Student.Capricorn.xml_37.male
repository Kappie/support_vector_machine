Well, when my mom went to the pound to look for him(some of you know what's coming), she saw the cutest little kitten, who couldn't have been over 3 weeks old. Now we have a new cat.   We named him Yoda. But not after Yoda. We named him after Yoda's father, Yoda. Get it? No? Okay.  He seemed to be getting along fine when I left (we took him campin'), and now I'm back- and i keep wondering what this monster is that is rummaging around my room. He's a wild man.   Everybody who saw the new Star Wars saw how Yoda broke out with his 2-inch long lightsaber and kicked Dooku's ass, right? Well, imagine if he were on Meth in that same scene, subtract the lightsaber and add wolverine's claws, and you get our new cat.   Apparentally, right before my parents left for the airport to pick me up, my dad was playin with the cat, so when i saw him, he had a big old scratch across his nose. I wondered if he had stuck his face in his computer's cooling fan. Nope, just a cranked up Yoda.   In other news, in Maine, a group of Crystal Meth users were arrested by police this morning, with the first 6 getting captured immediatley, and the remaining four escaped by sprinting completely across Canada.   Wow, I got through an entire post without mentioning Blue Man Group! Oh, sh- DAMMIT!!!
