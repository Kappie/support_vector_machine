Since I  urlLink wrote  and subsequently  urlLink published  my  urlLink research paper  on GLBT rights and inequalities, I've gotten some good feedback on it, including "…congratulations on an excellent paper! It was quite wonderful…" and "With young people like this one, the future is indeed bright for GLBT citizens!".  Thank you to everyone who's read it and commented on it. When I think about it, I have done a lot on this subject this year. Twice for a competitive event (Student Congress), this paper, and later this week (I think; depends on how the class goes) a debate on gay marriage in my Forensic Speaking class. I guess it all relates back to my strange love for the American Government, the Constitution, and my über liberalism.
