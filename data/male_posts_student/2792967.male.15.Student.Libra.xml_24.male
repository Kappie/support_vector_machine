But the more I try and think about something else....the more I think about what could be...:Sigh: Petes still here, sleeping like a log as allways. I swear that boy could sleep in the middle of a bombing raid. Thoughts about her keep pouring through my mind... GAH!! I hope she comes online again today. I really enjoy talking to her. I wonder if I would even have a chance with her...Anyway....Ill probably be back again before tommmorow.   **Listening to Jamiroquai - Drifting Along**
