I heard that for the first time, they had a "knowledge quiz" as part of the competition.  The highest score was 12 of 16 correct.  If you didn't see the pageant either, you can imagine with me that these were the questions (keep in mind they were multiple choice):  1. What's your name? 2. Spell the first word in the title of the movie "A Beautiful Mind." 3. Name a word that rhymes with "gymsuit" and starts with the sound "sw." 4. Name one President.  (Hint: the current President is George Bush) 5. If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands. 6. What's your name again? 7. What's 1+1? 8. Count to ten, starting with the number 10. 9. What day of the year do we traditionally celebrate New Year's Day? 10. If today is Monday, what day of the week is today? 11. Name one TV channel, by number. 12. Put your left foot in. 13. Take your left foot out. 14. Put your left foot in. 15. And shake it all about. 16. Do the hokey pokey, and turn yourself around, and that's what it's all about.
