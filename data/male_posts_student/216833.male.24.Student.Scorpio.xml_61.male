I just don't want people to think I am trying to be cool. I just think writing rocks and this is a daily outlet.(I edited this post to clarify my point) I wish I could be more truthful about the way I feel sometimes, but that is why I have a personal journal made of paper. I would just rather type it but I don't think I would ever write in the book this much. It's just so convienent.  Nick came over tonight and we had some quasadillas and I started up my stars wars robot grill. It looks like those little things that ran around on the death star and a cross between darth vader's helmet. I like it. Makes me feel like powerful to control fire. whatever.  I've been writing a short story for Al's zine. I think I pretty much screw it up. I will write something fresh - blah. Listened to the new Cave In sampler EP thingy. I like it, i think their new stuff is awesome either way.   Work was the same - blah. Worked out the back today - I wanted to work on the chest - I will just get to it later this week. Maybe I will skip out on the legs this week.  I feel better than I did earlier today. I'm just so fed up with everything.
