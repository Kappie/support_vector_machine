Somehow the little plastic piece on the side of my door came off and my right-side headlight cracked too. I don't know when it's going to be fixed but at the moment I don't know how to take it off or attach it to the car. There'sa bunch of plastic things that popped off and I guess I could try to attach it like that, but the claims guy from my insurance company hasn't seen it yet and I don't really have anywhere to go in the immediate future.  Oh, and I was accepted to UMSL, but that doesn't help because I won't be in St. Louis attend.
