And my stupid brother wouldn't stop her from barking. So I had to get my cell phone, becuase I was just way to lazy to get out of bed, and call my house to yell at my brother. So finally they got her to stop barking. Then I got up and took my final. I got a 93 on my Algerbra one. He has a freaking huge curve! Which is the coolest thing ever! Because I would of done horrible without that godly curve. Then in speech we ate brownies and food! That was a great final. Then in Spanish we had a great final. It was 100 mulitple choice off a website! I love you Mr. Blair! Then I got out and came home. And then listend to music. Oh yeah people I'm the Captain! I have whole topics dedicated to me ->  urlLink link
