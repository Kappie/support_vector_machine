I don't even know where some of these brusies are from.  I have to be at school for 7:30 in the a.m. and I don't get home till around 4:30, that nine hours at school.  It is really hot out there and i have no sunscreen.  But I love football and this is my last year of have to deal with it.  I am captain so I get to "lead" everyone else.   On a completly different note I found out this week that I am sexy.  But I think I need medical attention.  You know who you are.
