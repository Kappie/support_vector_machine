I thought this class would be fun and easy, don't get me wrong, sitting down and doing nothing isn't too hard, but it sure isn't entertaining.  Did I mention this is boring?  O well, I had some donuts this morning so I guess it's all good.  Can't wait for something eventful to happen for me to post.
