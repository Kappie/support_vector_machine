The Legislator passed the budget passed yesterday, only four days late.  Although there is an increase in spending in the new budget, there is thankfully no increase in state income taxes.   The Governor got his slot machines yesterday as well, making Pennsylvania the 18th state to legalize such gambling.  The new slots promise to bring in close to one billion dollars in revenue.  Revenue earmarked to give property tax relief to Pennsylvania land owners.  Experts estimate that in several years, Pennsylvania will have the second highest number of slot machines in the nation, second only to Nevada.  The new slots will be located in the state’s horseracing tracks for now, with the potential to expand into other venues in the future.      In the end it looks like Rendell’s tactic worked out well for both sides.  He got his slot machine bill signed into law and the Republicans got the budget passed without having to shut down the state government.  All in all a pretty good deal.
