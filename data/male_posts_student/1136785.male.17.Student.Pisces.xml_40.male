But I kinda like belonging to the group of holier than thou autodidact emo. That's just how cool I am. If I was a superhero, I'd be...      urlLink Him  or Spiderman; really basically the same, just with more ejaculating sticky white fluids from your arms. Hah, I'm twelve.   I haven't been doing much reading as of late, so not nearly asfar as I want to be (eg: done) with the 9/11 Report, but the roughly over half of it I have read is very interesting. It began with the hijackings, which were rendered in enough detail, with transcripts of cell phone calls, the black box from United 93 which crashed in Pennsylvania, that it gave me chills. Terrible. It then goes onto to describe the immediate descisions made be the FAA and NORAD, which were for the most part too late or forgivably wrong. A large analysis is made on the intelligence gathering functions of every major federal law enforcement/intelligence agency, and their repeated failures to share information, along with a history since the seventies of why.Interspersed in all this isa detailed history of Al Qaeda, from it's origins in 1988, a survey of it's financial backing,its stay in the Sudan andits move to Afghanistan, the Clinton administration's actions and lackthereof against it, among other things. It's all quite fascinating.The sheer detail they go into when discussing the formation and executionof the"planes" plot is amazing, albiet heavily drawn from interrogations of captured Al-Qaeda members, which the report notes. The primarily 'detainee' source is the mastermind behind the plot, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. As of now, I'm at point describing therecruitment of the so called 'muscle hijackers' and their entrance into the United States. I recommend the read to anyone with the slightest bit of interest and whoever has the time.   I'm going to dinner now, and then I need to call American Airlines about pushing my flight a day back so I can go to Maine.    urlLink This  is interesting.   I might put up something more later tonight, though I don't know why I tell you that.
