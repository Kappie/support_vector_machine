It made me feel good, especially since he was talking mad shit. then one player on the team, Kieth Campo, was supposed to get off the field, but he got in a bind on the field, and wound up getting leveled. And coach grasso goes, "you deserved it dumbass, next time listen to me." everyone was histerical laughing cause it was probably the biggest scumbag thing to do/say. I have a scrimage on saturday morning, then after that, im going up to albany with reza for a fun filled evening of fine food, fine drinks, and hopefully fine bitches. i dont have a fake id so i dont know how far ill go, but its all good, ill just bring a bitch back to the room.   Ahh, bitches in bed..... peace nigs
