Den met syahidah to discuss the IAW thingy again..serius speakin felt guilty..cos on the thurs meeting..she's the one hu spoke a lot compared to me hu have a quiet outing there..N guess wad? she told me that the way she talk happened to hurt one of the comm members.. I dun realli realise dat but since i'm very quiet at dat time i failed to interfere in that matter.. If i were to interfere dat.. maybe the problem may not occur..anw..syahidah's the latest to discover one of my natural characteristics..being too quiet.. Anw thanx for assisting me very much so far in IAW committee.. Insya allah u will be the in the next coming mss exco..Gee..  Hmm very funny dat i wear baju kurung on the friday but didn go to friday prayers..Why? coz need to report at pizza hut at 2pm..for job training.. Juz have a taste of wearing the new kit..n meet my old members..the world is damn small.. Anw all thankz to saddiq, my sidekick, for helpin me get the job.. even he taught me evrything during the training..   then went back to sch for mcc rehearsal.. Another funny thing happened.. i didnt realise dat but midzi later on remind me dat nite.. let me begin.. I happened to meet riyan juz near the canteen one stairs.. den midzi shout my name..of coz i dun realli aware of dat.. den midzi told me that he pressed his car horn few times dat most ppl in the canteen one looked at wad he's doin but obviously again i didn hear at all.. Poor midzi.. again i'm the one hu caused another person to be at fault.. first..syahidah..den midzi..haha.. so funny n guilty if i were to recall these situations n the blurness of me.. but anw so sorry..to hu have been victimised by my weakness..
