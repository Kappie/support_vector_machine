She was flying back from DC after a weekend getaway (getaway from Rochester) for Luke and her to check out the area since she'll be moving there in a couple months.  Luke started his new job.  On the way back to her place, a cop pulled out behind me and I knew he was going to pull someone over, since we were all going 60.  But he pulled over the guy that passed me going 60, which meant he was going 70.  Haha, sucks for him.  Laura and I chatted and then I went home. :)
