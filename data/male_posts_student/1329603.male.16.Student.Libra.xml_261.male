And, to be honest, it now ceases to matter. I've done them - I can do little more now than wait.  Not sure what to do with myself. I would go into Pates to see Laura (and other people, but I don't want my motives to be guessed, I'd rather just say them) some lunchtimes, but I'm worried about getting mauled... might just go anyway but in all realism I think I'd get annoying, so I shall probably just stay here and play Final Fantasy a ridiculous amount and do some trombone practice. What fun I have. Anyway.  *clicks tongue* This bit of holiday would be made a lot better if I didn't live in a different town to most of my friends who are also off... Tom and the Pates crew are all still at school until mid-July so I've got a while before I can meet up with any of them really... well, in school days, anyway. Fiddledeedee. What if they came back, and I'd died of being alone? They'd all be crying "Oh no, why did we leave Jon alone, with no friends?" And I'd be laughing. Laughing from my grave. Heh heh heh.  ...  If you didn't know, that was a Simpsons quote.  ...  DON'T LOOK AT ME!!! DON'T LOOK AT ME!!!  Quote of the day: "Children, don't do what I have done. I couldn't walk, but I tried to run... So I, I just gotta tell you Goodbye. Goodbye."  From John Lennon's   Mother   Love Jon Roskilly
