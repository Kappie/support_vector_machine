I said that i was going to an amusement park, but i incisted that today we'd have rain.          PS1: we = me, adam, natália, natália's friend, i don't remember her name and a girl friend of them that lives in Swizerland  .        After 2 hours staing in the line, we decided to go to the mall, and watch a movie.....   Garfield  .. perhaps it's because i'm 16... The movie   sucked  . Just horrible! And then we went to this amusement park again - it's beside the mall - and we realized that any drop of rain had fallen, and the girls i don't know the name went to the park. This girl wanted so bad to get in there, that's because she is going home tomorrow.        That was just me, Adam and Natália. We had the BEST time ever. We laughed soooooo much.... at the silliest stuff.    And we said that we are going to the park on monday and on saturday (maybe) to Roda Pizza.... the best place in the universe to eat pizza. Pizzas of chocolate, coconut, banana, passionfruit. soooooooooooo YUMMY!!!        In the end... when we were going home....   rained!!!!!!!   And everybody was blamming me for Garfield! The thin' is.. i was right in the end!       urlLink http://www.garfieldmovie.com/  (   Garfield)
