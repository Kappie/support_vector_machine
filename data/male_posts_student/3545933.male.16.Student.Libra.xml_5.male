I never really watched Big Brother, but now as i seem to be becoming a victim of insomnia its essential watching. But i gotta admit, it is addictive viewing. I was watching till 3 'o' clock in the morning, and then some decent shows came on, by the time i started to fall to sleep it was light out. i should really attempt to get to sleep more frequently.  This weekend should be good though, a break from last week's 45+ hours at work and a warm-up for next weeks 8 tests. For a start i intend to sleep... yeah... sleep, but then a load of friends are coming over for a drink, which should be fun. But to add to the bucket loads of excitement already prepared for a piss-up... i'm going to Rockingham Speedway to watch some ASCAR and some local bands play. But alas. its not going to be perfect, as Rockingham speedway is also housing another performer, and his proverbial "crew". None other than 50 "i'm a hard man who gets shot alot, that makes me cool" Cent and his chums G-Unit and Westwood. Oh sure, a line up like that would have your average townie pop fan quaking in their boots at the meer mention of such an extravagant list of musicians, but not me. I don't even regard the aforementioned AS musicians. to me, they're a gimmick, relying on the fact that they're "bad boys" to sell records.   I know, i know, some of you are thinking "whats this guy on about, he hasn't listened to 50 cent etc." well i have, I've not only listened to the singles, but i took time out to listen to the albums. I'm not one to judge without actually listening. But i did, he sucks, all he does is talk in a monotonic voice as if he was selling brushes door to door, but its just plain crappy. He lies on the whole image that he's a hard man who plays by his own rules, who's had quite a few caps in his ass. all that tells me is that nobody likes him and he's shunned by his peers, to the point that they are willing to kill him to get rid of him. Of course, this isn't REALLY what hes about. Of course... theres more to him than that.  but i don't care.  Anyway, i'm going tomorrow. and i'm going to have a good time whether or not i like it. -angry face-
