Ive never had more fun my whole life.  You will love this school. (youll hate it to) but youll love it more. Its everytthing weve told you and more. Plus if u live on state, u can come to the SMUT tiki bar. plus were looking for people to join our soon to be started frat Pi Kap bitches. So i hate finals but they were alot better this time around which is good. Aside from education, girls are good, and i finally decided. If youve been there you know what im talking about. My birthday is the 13th so thank you, and the liqs are gonna flow like crazy.(I hope) so enough said.  Have a SMUTTY summer, and a SMUTTIER new year. [SMUT] Dopey out for a while.
