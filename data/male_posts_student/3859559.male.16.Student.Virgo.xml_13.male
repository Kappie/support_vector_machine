Daily shit that pisses me off is what I'm gonna write about today. Shitty drivers is one thing that pisses me off more than anything. Don't you just hate it when you are driven down the street and some idiot pulls out in front of you. Don't you just want to pull out a gun shoot all the idiot drivers in the world. I think it would be a big waste of bullets personally. Sometimes I just want to pull someone over and give them aticket for being stupid. People drivin slow also pisses me off it's like, "SHIT MAN I'M TRYIN TO GET SOMEWHERE GET THE FUCK OUT THE WAY!!!" You know what I mean because you have all been there before. I'm a really high strung person when I'm drivin it's likely that if you met me on the road you would think I'm an ass hole. It's just the need for speed baby. Nothin like drvin a 100 mph. over a hill not knowin what's over it. Takin you life in your own hands is wha tI'm talkin about there is something abut not knowing whether you are going to live or die. Don't get me wrong it's not like I go jumpin off of buildings, but I'm one to try anything. Rotary rule: Try eveything at least 3 time. I think they meant it to mostly apply to trying food, but I think it's not a bad idea in life.   So remember: Do it, Don't get caught, Deny it, and Do it again.
