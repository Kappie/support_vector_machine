I forgot to mention yesterday Bruce, my fraternity advisor from Eastern Washington University, made plans with my roommate to spend the night here last night.  He showed up in the evening.  Found out instead of one night here to look at property in the northend, the's staying until Sunday.  Dale didn't know this was his intent when he offered for him to stay here.  He is out during the days and stays here at night.  Dale and I went to breakfast this morning; I got my usual eggs benedict.  We then went to Hallmark so I could get birthday cards for people.  I ended up spending way too much money on my Mom's birthday, but I wanted to get her something.  I ended up getting her a couple somethings.  She'll like 'em, but the wallet doesn't. :P    We came home and I wrote my statement for court on Monday.  I'm not appearing, but I'm appealing by mail.  I called the court to notify them I mailed my statement today and that I will not be there Monday.  She told me she would put it on the docket.  I went to the Post Office and mailed it and a birthday card for Rod.  Came home, chatted on-line and worked on homework until Dale and I met Mick and Mary for dinner at La Hacienda in Lake Stevens to celebrate Mick's birthday.  We were there for about 2.5 hours and had a great time.  When we got home Bruce was on the porch.  He couldn't find the spare key hidden (bad week for keys, no I haven't found mine).  I had some phone calls and chatted on-line while Bruce and Dale talked about boring stuff, property, and so on.  Chad, our 18 y/o neighbor that walked in on me masturbating not too long ago, had his court case dismissed.  The whole thing is stupid.  Another friend Garret leaves Tuesday for Job Corpes in Sedro-Wooley.  I think it will be good for him to get away from the substances for a while.  He's a great guy, but alcohol plays too much of a part in his life right now.  I found out one of my friends Larry doesn't have cancer.  Right after I found out this good news I found out Jackie's aunt does have cancer and needs surgery on Tuesday.  Once I get rid of one bad thing, on or two come immediately after.    Dale and Bruce went to their seperate sleeping quarters and I am now heading for mine.  Saturday is going to be a great day I can feel it.  Until tomorrow, dream of better days!
