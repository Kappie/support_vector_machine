Arthur came along to see farewell and pickup some "magazines" and to see if he could offload his prize of his competition to anybody. Anyways this dingy and small mini-van pulls over. We jokingly say thats our bus, it in fact was our bus. So we had to get on this packed mini-van, packed that we just had enough seats and we had to put some luggage on the inside corridors. That was pretty povo.  Nothing much happened on the bus because everbody was pretty tired with the exception of this guy and girl that diddnt talk non-stop all the way and the guy had this insidious laugh that grated everybody's nerves. Also we learnt later that the trailer at the back in fact was to fall apart, would had been a classic to see it fall apart on the highway. Oh yeah who could forget the cool wind at the back of the bus!  So we arrived at Cooma to hire some gear and meet up with Lewis and then it was straight to Kookaburra lodge. We arrived at around 1:30-2 with the entire trip taking 9hrs for some reason. Diddn't really matter what time we made it anyways since it was hard to sleep with the snoring symphony playing. With 8 guys in the room, it sure was going to get messy.  The next day we were treated with breakfast with strickly no seconds allowed and we got on the bus where we introduced to the workings of an eccentric person. This person would usually talk to himself or sometimes to others in pretty gay fashion, diddnt mind using his hands either. Anyways it was snow time where most of us picked up the "skills" we aquired last time around, except me. We creamed the beginner lesson and it was off to the bars. Can't believe we diddnt go on any bars last time because it was quite fun, only because I diddnt crash....much, well not too much. After intially not being able to make it to the first post we got the hang of it and in no time we were up the slope ready to plunge down into people. On one run I was sliding into the tree and had to pull out but on the path of the pullout was a tree which I had to fully duck to avoid. Feeling pumped up about my close call, I stacked it 5 seconds later.  After a tiring and enjoyable first day at the snow it was time to get back to the lodge where we had an hour to get showered and ready for dinner. Well the logistics were a bit weird with like 30 guys sharing 5 showers and having 60mins to all shower. Lets say some had a certain Eau de Natural on them. Oh yeah Kirit had a cold shower because he thought there was no hot water when in fact the tap names were switched around!  Dinner was an upgraded version of bizzos. The food was so good and filling that some of us couldnt finish it. It was so good Kenny left a plate full! Desserts which nobody wanted was pretty interesting especially the Chocolate moouse (sp?) which had an onion topping. Nice combination to be had there.   Back to the lodge for chillout and sleep. There we learnt tricks like "Pickup Cards" and "Could you put your hand in my pants and get the wallet out of my pants because my hands are full". It was all good as we watched Dodgeball and the White Chick which was a crowd favourite.   Day two at the snow and we diddnt have a lesson till 1 so we did some runs including a chairlift run with me not knowing how to get off and stacking it at the entrance and on the first run I even got off early and was boarding onto the wooden floor! The run down was pretty fustrating with not knowing the course and having to skate across some flat areas. Kenny ran into a tree branch causing it to snap and Kirit full ran into him from behind! I got snowballed pretty badly by Kirit and Eric while I was just standing there, cheeky fellows! We had level two lessons which I couldnt do for jack because I suck pretty bad with toe edge so everytime I did it I ended up in the path of the T-bar. I had a pretty bad crash while I was following Eric in his speed trap. It was just a bit too much and I fell and jolted my head on the ground. Lost my goggles earlier on so that sucked.  The supposed free beer and pub crawl never eventuated so we went for dinner at some italian place which was pretty generous with its servings. One guy was meticolous in his approach to eating food, cutting a single bean 10 times. We spent the night playing hacky-sack which was pretty fun and taking some "special photos" which may or may not be on Kenny's website. Later it was time for drinks at the Jindabyne hotel which was pretty packed. After that it was off to Banjos or was it the place next to it. Played some streetfighter which I sucked pretty bad at it and we played some of table soccer game I forgotten the name for. Kenny just told me its called foosball. Just like real life I left it more goals than I scored and I even got some own goals! We played some crappy games on the touch screen and it was back to lodge for some sleep.   from kenny : I forgot to mention that there was this games/recreation room across the cabins which had this strange smell. It wasnt until later that we found it was some underground facility for which the asian guys used to make rice in their portable ricecookers and also to make instant noodles.  Third and final day of the snow and people were a little worse for wear. We did some runs with one memorable run when I was mimicing Kenny down the slope and he stacked it. Well the last movement he was doing was a horizontal board so I ran over him with the board sideways, clipping his board and stacking it fast first. Good one Kenny! I dogged the level 3 lessons to teach some of Thomas' friends how to snowboard. Only one was willing to listen and no suprises that he was the only one that was getting the hang of it! One of them full plundged at full speed, diddnt even bother to chicken out into this little kid. Pretty bad stack and the instructor that was with the kid full on told the guy off. They sucked pretty bad at going up the J-bar with one stacking it pretty early on and he diddnt even let go of the bar even when he was on the ground getting dragged by the bar. Everybody was like screaming out for him to let go but he was holding on for his dear life.   After the day at the snow it was time to head off back to Sydney. Back at the lodge we were told we couldnt use to toilet which was pretty gay to say the least.
