Not to mention some enormous balloons that occasionally got in Tyke's way when they were walking.  But it was a good day.  The fog had definitely set in when Tyke woke up.  It was foggalicious.  Hardly any of the day was hard.  Actually none of the day was hard.  Except maybe power cleans in weight training but you can hardly call that difficult.  Just not the most fun thing Tyke could have been doing.  3rd period was pretty much a joke, as it usually is but this time in a different way.  It was mostly spent talking (whining some might say) about the Senior Project and how the goddamn Juniors don't have to do it but Tyke's class is still doing it to completion.  A really cool idea came up in class about some of the students going down to Olympia for a field trip to talk about the idiocies of the senior project.  It would be a lot of fun most likely.  But it will not happen.  How cool would it be to get a bus and drive that down there though?  A student drive it that is.  That would be insanely cool.  Tyke's never driven a bus before.  Nothing bigger than his Dodge Grand Caravan in fact.  As always the day forged on and english was also a joke.  Tyke put a post-it on his forehead that had 10 written on it.  That, combined with throwing the aforementioned post-it at the teacher from about 5 feet away without her knowing, was the highlight of the period.  Lunch at Taco Time was splendid even though the stupid worker there always screws up orders.  He didn't even give Tyke a number so they came out with the same number for Dr. Phil's food twice.  And Dr. Phil didn't even get the right food.  After lunch though is when it was really fun.  Good old 5th period.  Yep, another substitute.  Day 3 of Operation Try Your best To Keep out of Every class, or TYKE, worked very well.  Tyke was in class for 4 minutes yesterday but he beat that time with a 2 minute appearance today.  He just kept walking and sitting out in the sun and he and Macaroon went out to Tyke's car for a while and listened to music in the sun.  A fabulous day out again.  Tyke talked with a few people outside the school and then went back to the parking lot and waited for Purdy.  She was a little later than usual so Tyke was still in the parking lot when the bell rang for class.  But Macaroon was smart and brought out Tyke's backpack for him from class and gave it to Tyke as he was running back to class.  All was fine and Tyke and Purdy made it to Physics with plenty of time (as the bell rang).  Physics was fun cuz they just talked about flicking off little Japanese girls and taking their noses and kaleidoscopes and the lab that will be done at Tyke's house on Sunday.  After school was quite fun too.  Tyke has played a lot of basketball this week.  Today included.  They went up to Amed's house but had more people this time.  Tyke picked up both Big and Little Twigg on his way to pick up a jew and someone whose last name sounds exactly the same as "jew" before getting up to Amed's court.  Little Twigg is quite good.  He certainly stopped Tyke from dominating the games like he had sort of (not totally but yeah, kinda) been doing the past few times.  Tyke still had some nice moments like a bunch of left handed finger rolls in and a sick steal of a pass that was thrown by Amed like 15 inches above Tyke's head (probably less than 15 inches cuz that sounds like a lot but it could have been more too...the point is that Tyke looked like Nate Robinson getting way up) and he just snatched that ball out of the sky.  He took a bit of a beating from the bigger and more physical Little Twigg though.  He was tough to guard.  Tyke did probably a bogey job guarding him.  But offensively he was pretty good as long as he wasn't shooting treys.  The fadeaway jumper is his game.  And Tyke also noticed he shoots differently the mid-range J from the long-range J.  The mid-range shot Tyke lets go higher up and more like an NBA player would.  But Tyke doesn't shoot it well if he does that from downtown so he has a lower release point from outside.  Not uncommon but it's pretty noticeable.  Basketball was fun though.  Piggy J did not make an appearance this time though.  Tyke called him but didn't get an answer.  Then Piggy called him back a few times but Tyke wasn't there.  It's ok.  Cuz the Dawgs won.  They should really be in the tourney now.  One more win has to guarantee them a spot.  They are good.  Nobody really takes over the game it doesn't seem like though.  They all chip in very well and are a great up-tempo team.  Very fun to watch.  Especially cuz of Nate Robinson.  Even if he doesn't do anything spectacular you enjoy watching him cuz you are just waiting for that unbelievable play.  Kinda like when you watch Tyke ;).  It's not even 9 yet.  Oh yeah, stupid 3 tests tomorrow.  Stupid no studying for 3 tests tomorrow.  Stupid not caring about 3 tests tomorrow.  Oh wait, that last one is good.
