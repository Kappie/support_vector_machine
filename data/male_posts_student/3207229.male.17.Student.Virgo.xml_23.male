Apparently there is a great subtly to this line but I don't know it yet. Enlighten me please! (This quote is also very sexist: generation implies both men and women in an certain age bracket: this quote assumes that GS is made up of only men.) In the meantime, let's just take on this ridiculous "Generation Sex" concept. Firstly, sex was enjoyed by every generation and the people of the 70s were probably more obsessed than most. (A close reading of Song of Solomon, the bible's very own erotic poem, reveals even in bible times breast size was a concern as it is today. Though, thankfully, they didn't have Page 3.) Secondly, it's unfair to Christians, young priests-in-training, people in comas and many other sensible souls to suggest that we are all obsessed with sex and proud of it.
