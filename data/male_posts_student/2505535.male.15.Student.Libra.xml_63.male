Had a (mario) party thing last night, it went well I thought, we had pizza, hola hoops, whiskey, wine, rum, mario golf, mario party, and there was a good turn out of people to. It didn't take much effort to get my room tidyish again, but there's a coke stain and a blood stain on my carpet; luckily I was away when Ging was producing "bits of brain," I think it was the double shot of rum that did it - my one made my eyes water.  Well, that's all for now, I've got a sudden craving for  Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 .
