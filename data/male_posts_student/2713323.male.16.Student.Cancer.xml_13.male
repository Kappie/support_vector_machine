Saturday passes really fast, before you know it, its time to sleep. Sunday passes quite ok...and when its like this, you have no mood to go out cos of the constant reminder to have to go to school tommorrow, which ruins your entire sunday. So here i am, a loser, sitting in face-to-face with his computer screen, and a geography textbook sitting in front of him. DOH. This is how i spend Sunday afternoons. Shitty and Sucky. No mood for lunch now do we. Heh, very soon it'll be the big Os...worried sick. My aims? L1R4, if i get 15 i'd be happy sick. Grades? Come come let me show you...English=b3 Emaths=a2 Humans=b4 Physics=c5 Chem=c5 Art=b3. Tada. Total of 17 points. Hmm....i wonder if i can get the -2 from CCA points...You know, I'm supposed to be studying now, but i'm too lazy, just like every other day since the start of school. Cant wait for my next crue box set to come, found a place that sells it cheap, in fact, 1/4 less cheaper, compare 80 bucks with 120. Waiting for geng to come now, don't know whether my dad is having a bad mood, for me, i think i'm feeling a little shitty now, perhaps because its a sunday, or, the fact that i'm forced to study so early in the afternoon. Hmm...I need some good music and soccer now. Come to think of it, i may have a large circle of friends, but there are less then 15 that remains true to me...some that used to be really close are drifting away, just like sand through the hourglass...and so are the days of our lives. O yeah, i better go write ricardo a testimonial now...in the mood to type yeah. O, i forgot to include the segment where you have to tell what you did yesterday or today...yeah...for me, i walked to kel's house in the afternoon...when i was hiking up the hill, i took of my shirt cos it was damn hot!...den this "auntie" wearing glasses driving this really old brown honda car horned and smiled at me...i was like what the hell? Then i posed and threw the horns and her...and continued...heh, i cant say that i was walking or running, so yeah, i was just travelling in between that pace, avoiding that...er...woman. yah. Played round after round of winning eleven followed by iron man xo in heavy metal den winning eleven again, and we didnt know where to go after that. Took us around half and hour to decide, funan it was, den we album surfed and sat down for some desserts and soda at raffles city. Went home relatively early yesterday...daniel took a cab with kel and i waiting for like half and hour for my sis to come, she was sending me home with her group of friends...i was how should i put it, scared? when i was inside because judging from the way shes driving...really, we can get a accident any moment. Reached home, used the computer for a while...and den poof, went to sleep, was really tired cos i woke up at 8.30, dont know why. o well, i talk too much. thats all, ciaooooo O_o.
