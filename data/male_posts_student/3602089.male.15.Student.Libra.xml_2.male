I felt so sick...but now, today, I am hungry.  I think, perhaps, I should go on a forty-day fast and not eat anything.  Fasts are quite healthy, because, at any given moment, your body is carrying five to ten pounds of toxins and other bad things.  Fasting releases these harmful byproducts of your body making you healthier.  I'm nost sure which DVD I want to watch tonight... either Office Space, Fantasia 2000, Behind Enemy Lines, or The Others.  Everyone told me it was going to be a nice day when I knew it was going to be crappy.  I woke up to ugly skies but now it is sunny...wtf is going on?!  I believe that the events that take place in the movie "The Day After Tomorrow" are not too far in the future from occurring.  We have all of these screwed up weather patterns that do not necessarily follow anything that we've seen in the past.  Barcodes are awesome... www.upcdatabase.com is my website of the day. I'm out...
