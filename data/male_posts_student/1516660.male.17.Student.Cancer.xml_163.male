And Ah Ji is always right. But the good thing is, he's not angry lor. And he said he will try to talk to me after the Os. When we are not seeing each other frequently, and not as close. I don't have to talk to him lor. He will. Me? What I feel? Well, I respect his decision lor. I won't try to talk to him, neither will I open any opportunity to him lor, I mean, before he's ready. Since he makes this firm decision, and I can't do anything about it, I might as well respect this. And I felt so dejected, rejected. One side is like wanting to talk, the other is not wanting to talk. This is like so opposite. So contrasting. So different. I feel sad lor. I am now feeling like crying, but something tells me not to. It's not worth it. Why cry, when something good awaits me at the end of the year? But right now, I don't want to get my hopes up high le. Just lie low. And wait. Yeah. Now, I don't know how to face him tomorrow. I think it would be awkward. I think I need Wendy's and CQ's support. I really do.
