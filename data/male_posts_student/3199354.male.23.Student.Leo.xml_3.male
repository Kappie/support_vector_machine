LOL! ...right after she shows off all the creeps she's dated. Well I've got too many good things going to count now, and its just a matter of juggling them and remaining crazily busy for the rest of the summer. I've discovered that being tired is a great thing though, it adds to my personality handsomely. I hiked Mount Ascutney with the most amazing young lady yesterday, and unlike with other girls, we actually went all the way! mwahahahaa. I didn't think I would settle down and commit to anything this summer, but I'm not committed to not-committing either. What has happened to me that makes me catch the hottest, previously seemingly unattainable ladies checking me out and then smiling at me and saying hi...everyday? Hahahahaha
