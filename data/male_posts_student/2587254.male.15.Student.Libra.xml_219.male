Muahahaha I actually managed to play two well played games today, except in a fluky mishap, Gavin and Jane actually managed to beat me and Steve in a close neck-to-neck game...they won 3-1 in the end which sucks, but at least I still won another game today haha. so 1-3 in total today, ugh....today was horrible for luck....even on the PS2, Gavin managed to beat me by somehow making 4 interceptions in a row on NFL Street....this was all computer too....Jason can't even do that! Oh well anyways.....  Other than that...  Well this morning I woke up around 11 or so. I've woken up from dreams at 630am for 3 nights in a row now which is kind of weird, but eventually I manage to get back to sleep anyways. So after waking up for the 2nd time, I then headed downstiars to watch a bit of TV, then go on compy for a wee bit. Afterwards ate some breakfast, and then drummed around for a bit. Afterwards, around 130 or so, went out to  buy some new shorts at the Adidas Outlet.  Other than getting shorts there today, Grandma also had to go get her passport photo taken at Wal-Mart. Eventually I also bought a new cordless phone there, something that my house really was in dire need of since all my old ones suck, and FINALLY I have one that doesn't static up from one end of the house to the other.  Coming back from there, I was getting ready to go to the WLAC meeting, and Gavin even arrived at my place. That was when Pastor Graham then called and told us he had to bail out because he had to go see a doctor about being hit by a softball. So after hearing the news, Gavin was surprised too, and eventually he stayed at my place until baddy @ 6. Josh I tried to reach him on cell and home, but he was not on either, so in the end he called me and asked what was happening. So yeah now we are rescheduling for Monday probably.  After that strange event, Gavin went to SC for a bit, and I got further in NFL Street. Then came the utter fluke of Gavin defeating me with ALL the games having at least 4+ interceptions...NOT USER PICKS.....INTERCEPTIONS. Stupid luck always being on the other dude's side....blargh...  Anyways afterwards went to play baddy. As I mentioned before, I got wrecked in 3/4 games. Gavin I came close to beating in singles, until I got tired and then lsot 15-8. I still can't believe me and Steve managed to LOSE our 8 point advantage and end up losing 3-1 (tie breaker set). Grr.....  That was pretty much my day for today. Tomorrow probably going to play more badminton, and then also have to clean the car for Saturday. Least I'm getting paid to do it.  Anyways that's it for now. Go about and surf other blogs now.  Shoo.
