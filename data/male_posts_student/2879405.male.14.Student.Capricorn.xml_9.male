RI saw our score kena thrashed by ACSi 14-4 and they lost to ACSi 10-11. So they thought that they are capable of winning us and became complacent in the game against us.  2. We are just too strong for RI.  3.  RI is just to lousy to win us.  4.  MIRACLE. 5  RI sux to the core. It really was a blessing in disguise. SoftBallerz, think about it.
