At the same time, went to collect my BUC plague, while waiting at the drill shed, was talking aaron, haha.. blaming myself why must we go so early and we still need to wait till 2.30pmlike that.  The interview was quite funny, when she first ask the question about the campcraft compeition, i replied" ya lor, the training lor.." imagine she was laughing, damn lame answer.  haha..  After the interview went back to school for the 40th thingy till 10pm.  The thing ended around 7pm but was waiting for the performace.  The Joseph was worth waiting for, very nice.  haha.. Reached home around 10.30pm and take a shower and sit down and watch my fav Jap Show, GOOD LUCK!! yesterday was about the health check and flight assesment, very nice! haha.. I don't mind watching for the third time.  Today went to school for parade, the parade started at 10am, actually don't really want to go one, but need to pass down some stuff to the new admin, so must get my body up to  go to school.  After training, went go with Wei Qiang and Aaron to have lunch and went down to bugis.  Actually wanted to catch a movie, but the time do not fit our time slot.  So no choice, went to West Mall.  The bus 61 was really long, I played the CD for three time.  On the bus was thinking about something.  Than found out that the passion was like getting down, so what is really happening? haha.. i still cannot figure it out and than i just fall asleep on the bus.  Went to west hall walk walk about for a while and than left for home.   Shall end here........... haha......
