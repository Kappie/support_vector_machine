The delay in posting since Wednesday comes strictly from back to back hangovers.  And travel.    Got to Arlington, where Tripper and I met up and hit the Rangers/Royals game at Dollar Hot Dog Night (you can tell fairweather fans by the price of hot dogs...the stadium was at least 2/3 full for the Kansas City Royals, and rare were any cheers for anything before the fourth inning, the time when everyone had their hot dogs).  Tripper's dad had a pass for free tickets, so we got that, but had four, and it was just the two of us.  My attempts to contact Daniel Harr failed, so we sold the tickets to the people behind us for $10, parking money.  So for me, baseball, parking, and four hot dogs cost $4.  That left a lot of money for beer, and we drank there, drank at the Old Monk (sweet bar off Henderson St in Dallas), and went back to his house and drank some more.    I'm always fascinated to see how friendships develop after the constant time together ends.  Tripper and I started as friends who would grab beers and talk life, but living together quelled that and had us as buddies who didn't really go out together, save six times in a year maybe.  So the honest conversation and airing of fears that he shared was unexpected.  Of course, he was ripped.  And so was I.  And I awoke to a blistering hangover at 6am, to hear his dad bellow a toilet bowl fart of epic proportions.    Spent some time in Dallas...grabbed a lunch at a bakery I like, got a phone charger for the car...usual grabass.  On the road by 11:30, thinking I'll be real late for my 4:00 arrival.  I got in at 4:13, and that includes some terrible traffic and road construction in Benton.  I've done Arkansas since 1992, and I can't think of a time that I-30 wasn't under construction.  It looks like a widen job, one that I'm sure residents will enjoy come 2031 when it is complete.    Met up with the D's after that.  Went out for sushi, which included moments that both Daryl and Daniel got upset about, leaving me to do awkward jokes and drink sake bombs.  I did both admirably.  The night took us to Cajun's, a bar that in no way lives up to the billing...less LAISSEZ LES BOUNS TEMPLE ROULES, and more Little Rock sorority girls who put on spackle and tube tops to show their wares to the drunk guy who will grind with them a bit on the dance floor.    Living in Austin hasn't been to bad, for the girls at least.  Sexies in Austin...ahhh.  Here, not the same.  Out of the place, maybe six girls I would approach.  Several others I'd hook up with, but it's vacation...you lower the stakes to raise the average (nothing sexier for a girl than to come back to some apartment where the guy is sleeping on the futon his friend had in high school).    But it's good to do the things you don't often do.  Rare are my trips to the hookup bar; not my place, not where I meet people at all, or the kind I strive to meet, I should say.  I can meet the great unwashed; several times last night I was grinding against plumpicity, beer in one hand, female hip in another.  A style I can fake, but not one I'm really interested in pursuing.  It felt more like playing EverQuest than it did like partying.    Today -  Writing, hopefully.  Hangover be gone!
