Thing looks like a toy (but I guess thats partly from Dex's choice of transparent for the color) but it actually a really funky fully functional 4 lens camera. The most interesting about it is the strange color effects that might occur after the picture is taken. I read about it when I was overseas and thought that it would make a cool gift for the arty type of people. Still do. May decide to look into it as gifts for some friends as their birthdays comes along. Thing is not cheap though, but not as expensive as I thought it would be.  Speaking of  Dex , I didn't really want to add on to the emotions that he and  Milton  are already going through. But it would be unjust of me not to mention them before they leave. Both of them have actually been huge influential factors in two areas that I can recall. My interest in playing drums and in having a blog. Sad to say that my interest in playing the drums is for more than my actual talent in it. Lets hope that this blog doesn't go that way as well. Then again, if you want to blame anyone for this blog, now you know who to go after. Good for them that they are leaving heh.  But  Dex  has been a very good friend of mine for a very long time. We basically grew up together in church and while I had a more wayward time before getting involved, we share the same memories of some of the best times we had in church. Recently our paths have diverged somewhat and I'm sorry that I haven't gotten to know better the Awake and now Sonic Edge guys and gals, especially his rocking Pension State Band members. Hopefully after  Dex  leaves, we would still have a common connection. Keep in touch bro. You'll be sure that I will keep bugging you if you don't.   Milton  has always been a big feature in the Crossover youth. He came in with a bang and has been banging away on that drum kit ever since. Apart from missing his quick licks and lighting chops, his huge laughter and corny jokes that rank right up there with the best like Danny and Sean and  Dex , his presence will be missed as well. I'm sure his closest friends are reminding him that they are going to, and will be, missing him when he leaves. I just like to add that they will not be the only ones.  Godspeed my Friends and brothers. I'll see you soon.
