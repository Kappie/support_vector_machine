It may seem intimidating at first, but posting pics is actually really easy after you've done it once or twice. First you need to download both of the above programs and install them on your computer. Picasa is kind of a digital photo album program, the first time you run it, it will search your hard drive and organize all of your pics for you (be careful, deleting a pic in Picasa will delete it from your drive as well!).   urlLink    Screenshot 1:  Picasa Main Window  urlLink     Once you finally open up Picasa, you probably should play around with it a bit and get used to the interface. To send a picture from one of the albums to the blog, click on the picture you want to send and then click on "Send Hello" in the lower right hand corner. This will open up Hello... Hello will ask you to register for an account (if you don't have one already). Once you login, Hello should automatically take you to the screenshot below:   urlLink    Screenshot 2: Choosing BloggerBot in Hello  urlLink     Select "BloggerBot" and "Send" to upload the pic you selected earlier in Picasa. The program should then bring you to the following screen:   urlLink    Screenshot 3: Sending using Hello  urlLink     Make sure that under the Blogger Menu (see last screenshot) "*U of U Friends*" is selected, and type a caption in the lower right box. Then click "Publish". If all goes well, your picture will be directly uploaded to the blog.  I haven't quite figured out how to publish multiple pictures to the same post (without some editing work by hand), if and when I do I'll post a detailed howto here.
