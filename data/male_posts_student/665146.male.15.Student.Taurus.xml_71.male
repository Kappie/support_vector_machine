That's right, I'm talking about Mr. Rogers.  A man whose only crime was lying to kids about fitting in that tiny trolley to get to where ever he wanted... was taken from us. And for some reason I specifically remember an episode where he went on a tour of a toilet bowl factory, and recall saying to myself, "Oh man, he must be desperate," but then I realized...  This is what kids want.  Toilet jokes.  Of course, there'll be re-runs, but for how long? It pains me to think that future generations won't grow up seeing him come in and take off his sweater and sit down and travel on a trolley and talk to puppets and feed his fish and learn about stuff completely irrelevant to anything he was talking about before.  I never thought I would, but I'm really going to miss him.
