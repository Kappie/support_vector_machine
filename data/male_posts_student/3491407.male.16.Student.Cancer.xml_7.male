But since I'm done my work I'm just doing w/e.   I've also decided that I'm gonna apply for another job today! haha this is kinda funny acually. But I supose if I can make money then its worth it right...? (well more money than i already can get/find/have) lol   Incase you have noticed that my new blog page is missing a few things like my picture and so on. I am working on it I've just been a bit busy lately. Well acually no I havn't just lazy so I am planning on getting that on soon the only thing was I have to make it small so they will host it for me! EVEN tho I was already hosting it myself for them they just HAVE to make it soo stupidly confusing dont they! I gave them the URL for the pic from my website and suposidly its too big for them to store, which makes noo sence! oh well I should get around to that in a day or two!
