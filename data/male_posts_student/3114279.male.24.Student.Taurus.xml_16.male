      Yo yo yo. So, with this blog thing I guess one of the main things is whom exactly should one tell about it? Cuz maybe I want to talk trash about somebody, but then I'd forget and tell them, they'd go and read my blog and then fireworks! Well, I'm going to talk trash about my roommate. Not really trash, but the other day I was commenting about how cool her bed was, and she said if I was her sex slave for the summer I could use it. She was totally serious. I'm not talking bad about her though. I would have taken the offer if it meant I could have been the sole user of her bed, but the offer meant I could sleep with her in the bed. Fuck that! It's already hot as a motherfucker up in this mug. Besides, being a sex slave would be totally inconvenient. I'd have to drop whatever I'd be doing just to please her. If I was out with friends she could call me up and be like "Glenn. Head. Now." I couldn't get out of it. After all, it is sex   slave  , not sex   employee  . I don't think we'll avoid each other sexually all summer long. We've been drinking a lot. A lot. Plus I'm frayed pretty thin, because I haven't had a girlfriend in many a moon. At some point one's brain just says "fuck it. it's worth it." Hm. Well, Nick Daleeeeeeeeeeeeeey, I hope you're feeling better. Me, I'm tired and sluggish, and I have to go be president of poetry club in a few short minutes. I don't even have a prompt. So, gotsta go. Come up with something interesting next time.
