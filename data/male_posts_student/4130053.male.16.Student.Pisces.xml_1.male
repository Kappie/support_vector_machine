Although they say the NFL is better than the CFL, I still truely enjoyed myself.  We left home at around 3pm and drove to Surrey to get the   SkyTrain   into Stadium station - where BC Place Stadium is - The Home Of The    BC Lions .   In itself, the   SkyTrain   is really cool, a bit like the   Docklands Light Railway   in London.  When we arrived the thing they called the "Street Party" more like the corner party (ha!) was getting underway. SO we walked around the shops for a bit and then came back for the party. I got to try a corn dog - which was relatively nice! - and got some free stuff.   The Beat 94.5   gave me some stickers, a lemon ice tea (nice!) and free months membership to a gym! Shame it ain't valid in England! I was also given a Subway football by DJ Big D which was cool. We made our way in and donated some canned food so I could have my photo taken with the Grey Cup - it is really big and cool! Just strolled around the concourse of the stadium and Uncle Nigel got me a free T-Shirt by signing up to a credit card! lol! I also got a programme and a    BC Lions    flag! Then we took our seats. They were really good - Row E seats 105  106! Really close to the bench.  The game commenced with the    Lions    coming out of a helmet with fireworks which was really dramatic! GO BC! GO BC! The    Felions Dance Squad    came out aswell, to a chorus of big cheers. They were hot! Lol! :P The Game kicked off and    BC    scored a touchdown early on. The match was even until the end of the 3rd quarter when    BC    dominated. There were some amazing runs and plays in the game and some really dodgy decisions by the refs! What do I expect - it's sports! In the end the Final Score was    BC Lions  47 - 27 Ottawa Renegades  ! GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!      The atmosphere is sooooo different from an English soccer game down at The Valley, slightly lower attendence tonight of 25,000 but sooo different! Whenever a player got into the endzone a huge cheer broke, also if they made a good run, another broke. They had these mini games take place between games where prizes were won -   Save On Foods   Kick To Win, Catch to Win,   Air Canada   Flight Path,   Tim Hortons   Coffee Race, Go Kart Race etc! The cheerleaders often came on to dance on the pitch. Also   Subway   were firing the footballs into the crowd - but I already had mine! A car drove around throwing stuff out occasionally. The bench was so close to us too! I saw a player get really stressed and smash up the water dispensers on the table! Lots of Mexican Waves happened and there was a crowd cheer metre up on the screen that went up when people screamed - bulls**t I know but its fun! I found myself to get more into the game as it went on!  There were big screens around showing people in the crowd, and also   TSN   (sports channel) were broadcasting. I saw Uncle Nigel and I up on the screen a couple of times, and also the   TSN   camera filmed us! I know I was on Canada TV as the camera light was flashing red! I'm Famous Man! I'm Famous in Canada! OH MY GOD!  Came back home and had a pizza from   Boston Pizza   - delicious - Uncle Nigel was giving the gal in the shop hassle cos she didn't know what she was doing, bless her. She was really sweet! She also liked my hat! Come to think of it all of the Canadian women are sweet to me, maybe just cos I'm English, or maybe its because of my good looks! EH! Haha P.I.M.P  At least I watched my first CFL game with a win. So theres 1 thing left to say - GO BC! GO BC! GO BC!
