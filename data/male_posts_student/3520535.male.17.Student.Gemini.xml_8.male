But I can't allow that, I have too much I need to do. My last day of summer school is tomorrow. I think if I do particularly well on this project I'm about to do, I can pull it from a C to a B provided I don't do too poorly on the exam. Who knows. And I seriously think I may have put myself in the doghouse with Chelsea. I've never seen her so pissed. She was quite upset when I didn't show up at summer school this morning, and was afraid that I'd fail. She bit through two weeks of nail growth that she was very proud of. After class she beat me, yelled at me, then gave me the silent treatment on the way to her house. And yet, I didn't even do it on purpose. I'd overslept and awoke when she called. At least someone cares. And Tiffany, Sarah's wife, isn't responding to my IMs, and I need to get my project out of the way so I can sleep. It's hard to muster the strength, and go to work tomorrow. At least part of this nonsense is almost done.
