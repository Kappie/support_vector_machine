It can feel so good, and read so miserable, especially for a rundown writer struggling to keep pushing on amidst a plethora of strife.   I notice my writing can tend toward melancholy, quite a change from the personality nodes found in social enterprise. Is it an opportunity to express some nefarious inner workings of my soul, a cavernous deep I prefer hidden from the acquaintance train of daily existence? I don’t easily think so, but it’s difficult to say. I’m a comic in person, a dramatist on the page. To get inside it could be fun, but right now the words here are enough.   What happens after this? Writing. That is the answer, folded twice and hidden preciously in enriched envelope, for removal in years time. No matter what tools I hold in fist, whatever trade or craft I employ for a living wage, my free time must seriously consist of writing, writing, and writing again.   Two years ago, I left a miserable library job at UT-Arlington. To call it miserable is unfair, because I enjoyed the people and it was a job with a mediocre but not paltry wage. To call the job worthwhile, however, would be a gross overstatement. UT-Austin called my number on the MA in Screenwriting, and I dreamt of baubles and wonderment from the glorified career that is professional screenwriter. I saw myself within fist’s reach of my goal, the closest I had ever been to something so exceptional.  Two years later, I am not a professional screenwriter. I don’t see myself able to grab the ring of saleable work tomorrow, nor the next day or the day after. My writing is not yet exceptional.   But I would call myself a writer. And I hold that title with more seriousness than I ever have before. I have a goal, and I plan to push as hard as I can muster in order to reach it. I don’t write pretty scripts. I don’t write high-concept fare that will make Shane Black or Jerry Bruckheimer sprinkle his BVDs, a ¾ chub of scriptitious excitement. I write the indie drama, the story that people ought to see, that people would enjoy, that could someday change the way we look at things if enough people got out there and my writing improved enough. I write to tell a story, not to make money.   And I write. And I understand craft. And I love craft. And I love outlining. And I love putting the words to the page. And I love taking two hours over one pestering sentence. And I hate every bit of it all of the time, and I love it beyond the mere scope of one page’s words. I don’t want to imagine myself not doing it.   Duke TIP was once again, one of the greatest experiences of my life. Last year I coined it my Renaissance Birth, a coming-of-age redux for a man (first time I’ve called myself a man and decided to keep it based on age and responsibility index) shat down after wide-eyed Centery-esque post-grad dreams. The person I was at Centenary was the person I was at Duke TIP 2003, and the person I want to be.   The person I was at Duke TIP 2004 was a different person, but still the person I want to be. The pre-summer issues at hand (and the strong lesson learned that some things are best left unwritten), I knew TIP would be my savior. I needed the job this year like I needed the job last year.  I have no time to rewrite this, which saddens me, as I turn some fine phrasing in several paragraphs, and end others with venerable slough. Regardless, the muse must continue. This job came at the right time in my life, and the promotion from residential to instructional added a new challenge, a new responsibility, and a sheer lack of time to dwell on the sadness in the background.   The most interesting aspect of teaching this summer is, I am a better writer today than I was when I finished my thesis. Much better. Teaching 37 kids over two months the rules and regulations of form, grammar, outlining, idea development, research, and methodological word choice broke me of habits ingrained since I was their age. Just then, I planned to use ellipses after word choice, but remembering my teaching doctrine to the students, I stepped in with a new phrase. Discipline achieved for instructor.   They’re young. Many of them don’t get it. But you can see that some of them do. Lights turned on and off throughout the course. Some were here to play with friends, others were here because of their parents, and a proud few came because this was what they wanted to do with themselves, nothing else. And all left with more writing knowledge and at least a stronger discipline subconsciously.   I owe the staff a letter. I’m the writer, the one who turns the phrase with the greatest of ease, wrapping my audience in comfortable velvet linens, tucking in the corners, and winding them the greatest bedtime story ever told. And a kiss on the forehead before sleep.   They deserve it. I met a lot of wonderful people, and made friends, not acquaintances, but friends with people I hope to keep in touch with for a long time to come. It didn’t happen after year 1, but there were few I really had a strong taking to. This year was different on that. I had trouble leaving Global Dialogues because of a wonderful experience, but a lot of that was a memory of who I had always wanted to be. This time, I leave with a sad heart because life will never be this way again with these people, and that’s a sad time, because we enjoyed every last moment of it.   I am happy to get my life back, though. The key is what I am going to do with it. It’s in that envelope, tucked away for safe keeping, to open once a dream is realized.
