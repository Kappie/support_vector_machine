So, I woke up at 7, intending to rush off at 8 to meet with CQ. Ayioh! I cannot eat things properly now you know! My left gum surrounding the wisdom tooth (imagine yourself!) is swoolen. And I feel pain anything touches the gum! Ouch! Hurts!  Okay, managed to rush to Woodlands in time. I brought a pack of battery for my discman! And I was so shocked you know! So many people were late for school (the non 4/5ers of course). Oh my!! But I felt shuang when walking into school with them. I have a valid reason to be "late", they don't. Ha!! Anyway, met CQ and WQ. I listened to my Discman on the bus, but gave up after so many idiotic crackling sounds. We reached school at 8.45+.  We sat on the same table as Wendy and SuPing. All of us began to talk. Just relax. I didn't study Bio lor. Don't feel like studying last minute. We just talk and talk and talk. Then Mrs Chew came and marked attendance. And it turned out that Gao Luan and Shawn cheated!! GL looked at Shawn's paper. This is like so desperate. Cheating is BAD (okay, we often joked about cheating during prac, but we would never do it one lor!). At 9.50+, Mrs Chew called for us to assemble and go to Bio Lab! The moment!!  We assembled outside. It turns out that Mrs Jalil would be our invigilator. That's cool. But she's kinda strict. No talking and everything. When I went in, I started searching for Bunsen burner. Mrs Chua said she will put me in the teacher's bench if there's heating. Otherwise, I would end up in the side bench. I saw no Bunsen burner! Then I looked at the 2 side benches. Nothing on them!! I then saw that the teacher's bench got equipments set up for me! YaY! Woah! Sit up there feel so special. But hor, Faiz's facing moi. And I was like "Ayiah! Want to copy also cannot!" I looked at everybody, who seemed to be all looking at me.   soon, the experiments started. The first one seemed so complicated! It's about Vitamin C decolourising some inicator. We are supposed to find out how many drops of Vitamin C in diferent concentrations take to decolourise indicator and draw graph and the likes. I tell ya, it's kinda hard diluting solutions to half. But I solved everything by logic... and a bit of borrowing of measuring cylinder from the other side of the bench (sitting at teacher's bench have lots of advantage. Can take things whenever you like! Ha!!). Woah!! I don't feel consident about first experiment. However!! Second experiment is a life-saver for me! Mainly because I knew where to cut. I was wondering whether to cut fruit T.S. or L.S. I read the questions at the back, and then knew that cutting T.S. is the right one. And then staining cut surface with iodine and drawing it. Worth 9 marks! If I cut L.S., my 9 marks would be gone! Luckily! And I answered pretty well on that experiment, so I felt good. I even had 10-15 minutes left. SL said that watching me sit there and stare blankly into space is horrifying. Because at the last 10 minutes, when I was staring into blank space feeling bored, everyone was frantically starting on the 2nd experiment. Cutting seeds and everything. I washed everything out of boredom (Mrs Chua stopped me from washing test tubes in the end...hahaha!).   At the end, everyone was so worried because they lost 9 marks for cutting L.S. Ah. But I am sure they will pass! Jia you! In History lesson, me, CQ and Jason can't stop talking about Bio Prac. HaHa! During Maths, I wrote some poems out of boredom. I will be sharing one with you later on. Assembly's boring. Doesn't concern us. So I talked to XC.  We had SS extra lesson after assembly. Which is basically the same thing she went through with us during History lesson. After that, the choir members went to choir to get our graduating presents! So exciting!! We were given our own personalized scrapebook and tuners! The tuners were presented to us like we were given a medal to wear around the neck! So cool! The tuner is in A note. ~bangs tuner and hums~. The scrapbooks were very personalized! So many people wrote so many things! I was so happy with what they wrote! Thanks guys and gals. Oh yeah, speaking of gals. Me and CQ became "her". HaHa! In our graduation cert, it was written for both of us as "This is to certify that Kelvin Yip/Low Chin Quan has participated successfully in the school choir (2000-2003) and has shown determination and passion in HER work."!! I think they too lazy to make the extra changes for the two boys in this batch! HAHA!! So funny now if you come to think about it! We enjoyed our presents very much!  After that, we met XC and Ben (who left soon after) outisde the AVA room and went to eat. Ayioh! All of them teasing about me and XC as a "couple"! HaHaHa! Crazy cats yi ge liang ge! After that, me and XC went to Causeway Popular to buy stationary. Then, we discussed Bio on the walk out.   Came back home, called Wendy and talked a bit. Then, went to bath and watch a bit of Chun Dao Ren Jian. then, played FFIX. I levelled up a bit using Epitah (7k-9k experience and lotssa money too!). After that, watched Holland V, First Touch and Brainiest Kids. Then, came online! Ta-da!  Okay. My poem before I leave.   Isomaniac   Eyes tired, Heavily closing. Stomach growling, Awake.   Here it is! I hope you enjoyed my poem! See ya tomorrow. Or maybe not (due to Charmed and all). Goodnight blog!
