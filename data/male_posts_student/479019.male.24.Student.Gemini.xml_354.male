I think when it's all said and done, I'll have slept something like 14+ hours today... which means I was awake for less than half the day. That's not to say I didn't do anything productive while I was awake. I managed to do some grocery shopping, painting, and cooking.  Should I just go to Tornonto alone to see  Real McKenzies ? It's $100 round trip for the bus and another $100 for the hotel... seeing Interpol in NYC would be cheaper and more efficient, but I don't think they're all that good. Of couse there's the Surf and Skate thing in Asbury Park, NJ in April...  Alkaline Trio ,  Bouncing Souls , and  Bigwig  are playing the Sunday show. Damn not having a high paying job anymore!   Going back to Interpol... I like the music, but man... the singing... it's not for me. It's too much like that annoying emotive singing from the 80s. If ya didn't know... I usually prefer lyrics with political content... of course not bands I like fit that criteria...   Man...  Real McKenzies ? Celtic punk rock is so much fun. I have some time to think about it.  ***
