It was excellent performance by the Marist Pitcher, Harng-Yi who strike out all 3 batters who came out to bat. All these made Harng-Yi complacent, who striked out only 1 in the following inning, received a slow easy ground ball and made a simple play to one who got out. Marist's catcher, known as OR JIAO, has made a couple of homeruns did not make any in this game. However, he was agressive and made several good stops. If you watch closely, Harng-Yi is weak is the sense that he may not have stamina to pitch throughout. And if you watch his pitching, his pitches makes use of gravitational pull as the ball sinks right at the spot the batter bats, which makes stikeouts. Does he plan to do this? Was that tyco? Or pure skill? i would say its 1/3 of all. The Marists have disappoint PCSS as they go home with a knockout. Marist have now proceeded to the 2nd round. Well Done Marist. ~*~Full Time Report By Simhyi~*~
