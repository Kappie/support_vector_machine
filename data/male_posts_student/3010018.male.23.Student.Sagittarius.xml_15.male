When i was in the 3rd grade my teacher Ms. Kemp decided to give everyone in the class a nickname, not to be called by or anything but just something that described who we were in one word or something like that...anyway, so she decided the word that best described me was "Thinker" .... i was thinking about it earlier today that even at such a young age, i showed these tendencies towards being caught up in deep thought.....i really think thinker is an appropriate nick name if you want to call it that......  I still cant sleep, its like 5 AM on a friday and im wide awake, im sitting here in my bed typing away on my laptop....its frustrating cause sometimes i just dont feel sleepy....and for some reason all the food in my fridge doesnt seem to taste as good anymore....seems like my food always tastes better when im at home in fort worth, tx......i dont know why that is....
