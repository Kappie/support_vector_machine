Something about nightime just gets me going. Maybe I'm borderline werewolf or something. Yes, that's a perfectly logical explanation. AWOOOOOOOOOOOO!  Something about the blade just calms me down. Sometimes more than others. No, I'm not a slasher, at least not enough to qualify as one. But then again, they may have changed the rules, so I might actually qualify. I'd say about 2 every year. But the blade, holding it, it calms me.  Something about blood gets me off. When I see a vampire feed on a woman on the big screen, I stop breathing. When I get a nosebleed, I let it bleed until I get dizzy. Forbidden fruit, I suppose. Praise jesus. Maybe I'm a half-vampire, half-werewolf, protestant, japanese coneptual artist, televangelist superhero. There, that is a slightly more logical explanation. Gotta admire that Daphne (from Scooby Doo); always a logical explanation for everything. Don't believe it 'till you see it.   I often wonder what couplehood is like. I hope it's not like all those movies where the repair man with a nine-inch cock comes in and pounds the lonely housewife. I've never really been in a real relationship. The first girlfriend I had was in grade 3 I believe. I aslo think that's the first time an entire class of students ever made fun of me (it also would not be the last). The second one was in grade four, but she was using me to make her grade 6 boyfriend jealous. The next one was in grade 7, and she was a total whore. The next one was in grade 9, and after many months of "dating," the relationship had gone abso-friggin-lutely nowhere. Then, again in grade 9, I dated a girl that I was "in love" with for a grand total of three fucking days. Grade 9 was also another one of those times when the entire class, and -as a matter of fact- pretty much the entire school made fun of me. It's been cold hard lonliness ever since.  I often wonder what being in a relationship is like. Do I tell her I love her a million times a day? Or will she get creeped out and leave town? What if I'M to tired to do it? What if she doesn't love me back? So many unanswered, unfeasable situations. I've never ever really been with anyone. And right now, I realize that it really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really sucks. Really. Can you be alone if you never really had anyone to begin with? Can you miss something if you never had it before? Longing.  I want someone to fall asleep with me at night. That's it. That's all I ever wanted. Just someone to BE THERE. Nobody's there yet. I'm sure they're lined up out the door. If I was starving, and somebody offered me a bowl of cow testicles to quench my hunger, would I take them? No, because I'm a stuck up North American bastard, and am too ungrateful. Bring me steak and lobster, and then we'll talk. Oh, and a glass of apple juice. Wouldn't we all be grand? Everybody wants the fucking best. Everybody wants the most expensive thing on the menu. Romantic, smart, artistic, sexy, get your god damned heads out of the clouds. Look around. Do you think you're going to find perfection? Perfection does not exist. 'Cept in Nevada, but it's just an ugly trailer park and a general store. I for one, choose, no rather, am forced to settle for less. Less also happens to be the same as nothing.  Although I've got my eye on Lieutenant Ripley (aslo known as Sigourney Weaver). Something about a strong female character kicking ass sounds tempting. I fucking wish.  11:11. Isn't some sort of wishing supposed to be happening at that time? So far, I've got a grand total of ZERO wishes that have come true. Oh well, if at first you don't succeed, try and try again.  Why do we dream? I've decided dreams are useless. And I am no longer going to dream. Thus, I will master the fine art of sleeping with my eyes open. Man, I'm going to need eye-drops.     "Why can't I just be on the first flight out instead of here?"     Pity. I admired your optimism.     I'm going to be a god damned bachelor with mostly fucking milk crates for furniture. Well, at least I HOPE not. If I ever get into that scenerio, I beseach all of you, please, shoot me in the head. Quick and painless.  HOPE. There's that word. HOPE. I remember back in the day, I used to think hope was pointless. I used to think that hope and expectations could only lead to dissapointment. After all, you can't fall down if you don't get up. Maybe I'll grow accustomed to the dirt. Or maybe hell will freeze over. It appears history is trying to repeat itself. Perhaps I should've gotten better than an 85 in social studies. Then I'll show that history who's boss.  At the party today...Well, actually I guess it would technically be yesterday, my cousin tells everybody about how small her boyfriend's penis is. She doesn't know what to do. She can't fake it in bed a hell of a lot longer. Wonderfull news to hear, I'm sure, especially for her 16 year old cousin. But anyways, she figures she'll just break up with him. Wow. Wow. Wow. Is this what dating is going to be like? FUCK. Don't live up to expectations and you're out the door. I can't fucking wait for it. No, I think I'll just find a girl now, one that can see past the human body, and marry her real quick. Get a few kids, and off we go! I'm trying my damndest, but it's just not working. I'd sooner have a really long relationship, than lots of little ones. At least with choice a) the pain all comes at once. I'd gain less weight from eating buckets of ice cream that way. But then again, there's also fat free ice cream, but it's nasty, so fuck that. High-School romance? What? Romance? Romance is romance. Love is love. No matter how old you are, a love in high school is just as important as the next.  Why am I looking for love now? Won't it ruin all the fun I could be having in my teenage years? First of all, WHAT FUN!? Second of all, it is because I'm the closest thing to pathetic, and rather than go for the million, I'd pick Don Meredith, and go for the sure thing. He could make that throw better than I could. He was a quarterback, after all.  Wake the hell up.  Open your lies and deceit, and see the truth, in all its round, red glory.  The skies aren't as pretty. The grass isn't as green.  But you have to see the truth.  Humanity hates the truth, but this is the choice I have made.  Head is far away from the clouds.
