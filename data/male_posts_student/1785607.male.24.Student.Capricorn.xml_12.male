I went because I'm a good sport and I didn't want my bf and his friend to get bored with me...  So we entered, and in the stage ( if we can call that a stage ) was a guy, totally high, dancing, alone. There were cute guys there and some lesbos, thank God I was there with my baby or I would've run out of there... I was numb... never have I ever seen such group of feminine guys. Anyway, the music was kinda nice. Now I think that I might ( well, I NEED ) to get loose a little and start dancing, 'cause as I saw, "A" likes to dance.  Now on the "A" subject. I been thinking, and I sense we need to do something fun and not only the movie-dinner-kiss date, we need to make some memories of our own, I know I sound kinda extreme here, specially since we've known each other for almost three weeks and been on the bf phase for just a couple of days... but the thing here is that I love him, and I think that if we do not do something, this could get boring and not exciting at all, it's all fine by me, I'm happy just at the thought of lying there in a room, reading a book next to him, or just watching him watch TV... that's how much I love him. But he seems kind of the party guy... and that, more of an option, is a lifestyle...  now, one of the things I hate about our situation is that there's nothing to do either here in Mexicali or Calexico... so, what should I do? To get matters a little bit more complicated, he works all night as I go to school, we have mornings free, but he's tired, so do I, and if we DO go out in the morning there's nothing to do... mmmhh... I'm in a pickle... and today he's not around.   School subject.  OK, after a terrible week at school, in which I failed two tests, didn't pay attention, got a new teacher, and never did my homework, I got a little exciment in the shape of weekend... hahahaha! Ok, tests, the first one was History... Man! it was nothing good at all.. I knew all the subjects, but the test had tricky questions, and that's not nice at all. Now, the teacher did again the test because we all asked for it, but she got us again, asking obscure facts that had nothing to do with the material ( ok, the info was there in the material she handed out to us, but they weren't episodes of history, they were names that were just stupid to ask for )... so I flunked both times the same subject... So that pretty much sums the past week... it was hell...   I wanna see my baby...!!! ( I need to get him a nickname )
