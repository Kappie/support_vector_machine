After the movie the director  said something that really passed the oposite message of the movie, he said that Paris is dirty, crowed, polluted, there is dog's poop all around and the city is rainy, Wow, this man should be exiled from France.  I've heard that the city is fantastic, but full of whores. Well, someone has to work!! HAUHAUHAUHAU!!!! If someone who has been to Paris reads my blogger, s'il voul plait, post about the city. I could go there by myself, but with 100 reais - how much i have - i can't even buy a backpack.  Whereby i'm posting it , i'm eating a cookie named "Break up!" wow, such a help. I have this friend, she broke up with his bf sending him one of this, nowadays they're still friends..this girl is crazy, but thinking, it was nice of her. Hummmm... no it wasn't , she made him a piece of crap.   I'm feeling bad about the Math teacher, but he's a terrible teacher, he says something and then he said that he was wrong, it messes everybody's mind. Last week a girl delivered at everybody's desk a petition, asking us to sigh our names, if we get lost of sighs the head-teacher is going to talk with him.  I feel sorry for him, maybe it's not his fault if we didn't get good grades and all of us are going to have to do the tests again, maybe he was getting divorced and couldn't get focus, maybe his son has a serius deciase and he could pay attenion to himself, or worse, maybe his puddle died and he was hurt inside. I sighed my name, and i don't know if i did the right thing, and somepeople gave me as exemple " bla bla bla the math teacher isn't good, look, till André will have to do the test again, André" as if i was Da Vinci.   Well, voir vous demain école, or even today when i got back from gym.   P.S: i don't speack french at all, i have a little help from the PC's dictionary.
