For example, it has been said that ing games after Michael Owen (England striker) has a bad game, which he did against France- who, incidentally, before last week's game we had never lost to in a competitive international etc. etc. Anyway, oh yeah, after that, he has a 65% increase in his game. First off, how can you measure playing 65% better? The other point is doesn't it depend on the opposition as to how much better he performs. Surely his production against Switzerland would be better than aginst the formar World champions, who, incidentally, in their last competition failed to score a goal so...  What's my point? Well, my point is what's their point? I mean there must be somebody out there who comes out with all these statistics, burning the midnight oil and all of that just to come up with a fact that is either completely irrelevant and does not affect anything or is something that everybody knows and you could get the same answers just by asking some guy off the street.  Another point of it is the television ratings. Apparently, somebody asks lots of households in Britain what they will be watching on TV that week and on the basis of this, programmes are cancelled or given extra series. Now, who are these people? Nobody I know has ever been asked by these people what they are watching and it appears that what they do watch is most mindless drivel. Even if I was asked what I would be watching that week, I wouldn't know because I only decide what I want to watch when it's time top turn the channel over. How does it work?  Besides, have you even met 0.4 of a child?  Jack
