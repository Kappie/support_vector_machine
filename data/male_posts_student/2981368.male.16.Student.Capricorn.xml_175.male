Then I had to 'help' this old couple by carrying a 70L bag of compost up through the car park and into their car. That did my back in...then it was lunch. Where someone had left an open bag of muffins in the staff area. Bwahahahaha. Free muffins. After lunch, some very annoying person bought over £200 of stuff, then paid for it  all in £10 vouchers . So I had to completely mark up 20 vouchers with the date, my name, my signiture etc, while still serving people. ARRRRGGGHHH. Other than that, it was a great day. And I managed to get a few more muffins at the end of the day, as did Joe. And probably everyone else who works there.  Somehow, that 17 year old Russian girl managed to thrash the living crap out of Serena Williams to win Wimbledon. (6-1, 6-4). Wooot.
