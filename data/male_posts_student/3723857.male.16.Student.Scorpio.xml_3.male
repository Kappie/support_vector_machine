I slacked the whole day in sch.. but still learnt quite a lot from the physics enrichment lecture.. actually I already knew it lolz..tonite still must do econs homework.. pengz..   Wow today during P.E.. she was avoiding me.. supposed to be in the same team as me.. yet she chose to change team.. >.  But to tell the truth..I'm really sincere about her..I love her so much.. I'll definitely cherish her..Just looking at her alone is enough to melt my heart lolz.. its true.. she's so unique..   Quote of the day:  Love is to think about someone else more times in a day than you think about yourself.
