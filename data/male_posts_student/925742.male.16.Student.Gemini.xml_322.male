Then Kim came over and we worked unsuccessfully on those darn teeshirt transfers.  Eh, I'll do em right, tomorrow.    And then I went to her house, we finished a movie, took some smiley faced pictures and then ate some of the BEST FOOD I HAVE EVER TASTED IN MY LIFE.  I hope that wasn't too specific.  Now to sleep.
