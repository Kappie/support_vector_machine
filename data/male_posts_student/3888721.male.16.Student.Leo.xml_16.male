Earlier on, i was watching the Man Utd VS Chelsea, and as expected Chelsea won basically due to Man Utd injuries to 9 of their players, and of course, their defence failed them once again. After 2nd half, i was switching between channels as i was watching Channel 5, and saw Ronald Susilo, convincingly beat World No.1 Lin Dan without much difficulties, and you bet i was impressed. I watched abit of the portugal match and went to sleep soon after, realising that i have to depend on my luck for the geography test in the morning. Thus, i went into the geography period without any knowledge on tourism, which was supposed to be tested. Anyway, i was able, much to my surprise to crap out 2 and a 1/2 pages of geography and passed it up, and just hoped that my winning streak is still there. Anyway, next to kao peh on the list is Physics lesson, where we had our practicals on Monday. Everything was going on smoothly but i was getting tired by the moment, and thus, was yawning every 5 minutes or so. Then, he said:" you wan to yawn go out and yawn, no manners." I retaliated with "yawn also cannot arh", and he said no. Well, CKP, you can just fuck off for all i care you son of a fatherless whoremonger. What I do is really, non of your fucking business, so stop interfering. I then said to wei xiang:"If i am made MOE, the first thing i would do is sack you bloody asshole and if possible, exile you from Singapore, because you are definitely not fit to stay in Singapore." He then carry on to reprimand Nico for whistling, how asinine can he get? why don't he just go and be a parapazzi since he like to interfere in what people are doing. Why can't he be more like his wife, more effective and command respect from the class. CKP, depending on your wife is not good you know, ruan fan(soft rice) is not nice to eat and i can't imagine you, a man is depending on your wife. I figured out our principal didn't want to sack you on account of your wife, for her contribution to the Os students every year in the biology sector. Ok, i shall not waste my breath on this type of useless civil servants, and the that perfect phrase to describe him is "lan yu chong shu". Put him beside Mr Lim Beng Huat, and you can even smell the difference, let alone see it. Everything went on as usual and i went home after school. Me, Mervyn, Chee lim, Ming Yuan, Jonathan had formed a basketball team for tomorrow's P.E. lesson known as the Cartoon Dream Team. We have already formally issued a challenge to Justin's team and the game in expected to commence tomorrow at 0910. Well, I'm given the role Captain America, and yes, expect to see me use my finishing move tomorrow-FINAL JUSTICE.
