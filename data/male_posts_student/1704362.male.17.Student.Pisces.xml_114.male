Does anyone else keep a pillow between their knees when they sleep to keep them from knocking together? I do it, but the pillow always ends up on the floor or out in the hallway (?) One time, i went to bed in my room and woke up outside on the lawn with bugs crawling all over me. Any my mom says i yell in my sleep. One time, i kicked a hole in the wall in my sleep.
