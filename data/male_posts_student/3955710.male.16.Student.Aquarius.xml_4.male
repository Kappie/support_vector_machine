I mean what could be more boring and bland and 'alternative' than wearing a CGBG tee? I mean show a bit of imagination. That reminds me; order stuff off:       urlLink www.cjs.net        I want an At The Drive In tee and a Mars Volta tee so I want to wear them because I like the bands not as a statement  de la mode . I will also use French, Spanish and German terms because I'm pretentiouslike that. It will also look studenty. To complete this look... arggggh!!! that's what i was diatribing about in the first place. Can we really avoid the influence of cool? No. I might just say fuck it and get an afro... but I haven't got curly hair and I'd look ridiculous. Ah well.      Have just written a poem/song called Arctic Snow. I may post it on this at a later date. Most of my poetry I write at 2am in the morning, fuelled by a mix of Coke, DT Instant (Double Triple Coffee, six teaspoonfuls of granule, downed in one. Ferocious) and Chili Heatwave Doritos. It generally concerns girls I either fancyor have fancied. You didn't think I actually had a girlfriend, did you?At the time it all looks brilliant, and I imagine poetry critics comparing me to a young Dylan Thomas. But in the cold harsh light of day it is always crap. However Arctic Snow might be different.      Avoiding poetry though, I could be a singer/songwriter like Ben Kweller, Ryan Adams e.t.c. (Thought For The Future)      Next time I will do a complete profile and really sort of introduce myself. Then we're going on a little tour of Starship Afrika and then we're going to warm up for my holiday by doing the TOP 5 HOLIDAY MOMENTS! (includes plages nudistes, seasickness and crazy germans playing crazy golf!)      A Bientot de StarshipAfrika!   THOM
