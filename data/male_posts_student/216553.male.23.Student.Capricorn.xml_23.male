We then had to move to the library to finish off the last hour or so of class. Yay!    What's actually really funny in chemistry is this one girl in our class who seems to think she knows everything that's going on, while trying to make it obvious at the same time. It's funny how she has her "Mickey Mouse" organic chemistry textbook from the U.S. in her hands while she tries to correct the professor all the time. She's also proud that she comes from the ghetto part of NY, and actually gloats that where she's from has a high murder and crime rate, lol. Her brother is also here on vacation and has probably burned enough already that he probably doesn't even know where he is! He's also 18 and thinks he's a thug! Ok, enough crazy people commentary for the evening.    This afternoon, I went with Sirhan and Rajan to pay the deposit for our house...$1350 USD/month! Lotsa money, but it's a great place. And we're getting a pool by December! :)   Here's something I wrote. Ya right. It's my favorite Sufi mystical poet Rumi...enjoy :)  "In my hallucination,  I saw my beloved's flower garden,  In my vertigo,  In my dizziness,  In my drunken haze,  Whirling and dancing like a spinning wheel..."  Bye bye.  P.S. JL, if you're reading this, I miss you! Also, you're the best!
