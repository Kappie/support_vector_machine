Probably was the sloppy joes and chips and pop and sugar and energy drinks, lol.  But anyways, it was fun, one of my friends characters is actually now pregnant, we thought there was no chance (1 in 10 chance) but she's now pregnant.  On top of that, we got our asses served to us by a street gang, due to our rather unprepared state.  I was the only one wearing armor at the time, and even in all my full plated glory I just happened to get criticalled and sent into the realm of unconsciousness, our fighter saved the day, having healing pots and cleave, hehe.  Well, it was fun and I got to see all my friends, so the late night and morning sickness is really worth it, although compiled with all the late nights I've been putting in I think my body toxins are building up to critical levels.  Maybe I should just go get some sleep tonight for once.
