Those blimps, I love seeing them at Yankee Stadium. When I say Yankee I really mean Shea because I've been to Shea like 10 times and Yankees once yet I like the Yankees alot more. Yep all the news is, bad news bad news, death, violence, war. You know what I think, I starting to think that my former life or soul was bad in his world which is a heaven compared to this world and when I died my soul drifted into hell. This is hell. No just joking. But maybe I believe it symbolically, not literally...ANYWAYS. Besides for the fact that I keep seeing war on the news (Israel drops bombs killing children?) I have only one, well two things to say about today. No homework. 5 hours of drums. Greatness. That was three, does greatness count? I think so because it's one of those adjective nouns. Yea so that's it. I play like a German now. I learned how to play drums like a German, no joke...it's all in the hand formation. Just walk up to me and say GERMAN FORMATION and I'll Germanly Formanize entertainment for anybody's pleasure. In other words, I'll show you the German hand formation, alot better for bouncing the stick. Uh...what else, ah yes also learned difficult beats with the high hat hit on the quarter note up beats, yea it's hard. Try it. Count 1+2+3+4+ and keep counting and then tap your right hand on the +s and your left hand on the 2 and 4. Now go crazy with your right foot (NO DON'T JUST WIGGLE IT TAP YOUR FOOT AGAINST THE FLOOR WITH MUCH VARIETY). Drumming indeed takes much coordination. All together 6 body parts if you count the brain and your voice if your singing at the same time. 6 body parts coordinated all together! Remember what I said, read the first sentence of the blog. That's right you arshole.
