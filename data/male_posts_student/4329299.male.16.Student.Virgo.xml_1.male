Wait, I should probably start from the beginning, shouldn't I? Ok, here goes the quick version of my life. My name is Kyle, I was born in Baltimore on September 9, 1987. I have one sister, now 23, and one brother, 18. When I was 4, my mom and dad split up. I don't really remember much about it, but some. Anyway, we were on our own for a while, but not too long, in came the worst part of my life, for 9 long years. Kip. Its almost a curse word now. kip was my asshole stepfather. He lived with us for a while, and when I was 7, he convinced us to move out to his birthplace, Spokane, Washington. We drove for 6 days, and finely, we got here. I went to a small school called Lake Spokane elementary, where I met my best friend ever, Brendan. The small community I lived in, Suncrest, was pretty cool. I had my friends, what else did I need? Well, in 6th grade, I moved up in the world, went to lakeside middle school, a bran new school, about a mile from my house. This is when the posse came together. Lindsey, Brendan, Miranda, Anna, karla, Gina, Jessica and I, best friends forever, never to be split up, right? No, karla moved to main shortly after my mom left kip (thank God!!!) in which we moved into the city of Spokane, so with a few members of the posse gone, they tried to keep it from falling apart completely. But anyway, I moved. New place. New house, new school. Shadle Park High. It was my freshman year. I didn't know any one, but know where to look for friends, the only thing that connected me to the people here, the band. I have been a musical family forever. My dad plays drums and bass, my sister alto sax, my brother trumpet. So, naturally, I played trombone. So, I check out the band. Not bad, I meet a few people, including Kate, my first girlfriend in high school. Kate and I hit it off on the band bus on the way to a football game. My voice was gone due to a large Christian concert, one that she wanted to go to. She told me she was very involved with her church, I said the same and we started talking. That lasted almost a year. After she quit going to her church, started smoking (one of the nastiest habits in all existence) told me she would stop it many times, allways going back to it, drinking at parties, smoking pot, and lying to me about it, I decide to break up with her. Sophomore year, marching band, I meet a really cool tuba player, my current best friend, Joe. We hit it off pretty well, by this time, I'm already in my "hallway." that's how we are known, we all stay in this one hallway, a ton of us, just chill before and after school. Soon after dumping Kate, I start talking to a girl I had sort of met in PE online. We hit it off and Leslie and I start dating. Well, even know it was only a few years ago, I was young and dumb, and I noticed a girl in my hallway that I had seen a few times, that really met when I hung out with Joe. I dumped Leslie for allynn and that lasted a whole 6 weeks, her longest at the time. allynn is that girl in the hallway that all the guys want to date, and most have. She is very pretty and has this coolness about her, she just was cool. I cant explain it. Anyway, I dumped Leslie, which was one of the dumbest things I have ever done, and went out with Allynn for a while. That ended really badly, including me literally begging her to go back out with me. *sigh* sad I know. Anyway, last year, 11th, I see this cute freshman, tori, who we hit it off right away. No one even asked the other out. We kinda agreed we should on November 5th of 2003. And that's it up to now. I am still dating tori, and I am happy.
