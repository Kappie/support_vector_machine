God at least that girl can get her a stable guy, and quite rightly, she's an amazing girl in all aspects.   Last week went rather well, I got in some overtime and saw a good gig in view to the left, who are by far the best local band I've witnessed, one which the gig whore will have to accompany me to next time; and had an enlightening chatter with a skinhead about "the streets", and no, I don't mean Mike Skinner.   Well this weeks going well, me and Father calmed down after our heated phone conversation, and we most probably will be setting of on the 31st somewhere sunny FINALLY!   The other thing I've been really thinking of in  till time  is what would happen If I got a terminal illness, and I reckon I'd be ok with it, well more than others would be, and that is saying a lot about others appreciation for a wanker such as myself. Personally I'd choose the cancer option because it always has that lovely  right to withdraw if you early enough  clause in it. My whole family seems to have been stricken upon at some point in there life, so it wouldn't be a great shame If I got it anyway. I doubt anyone would kick up a great fuss about me anyway. Well it would piss me of more if people I haven't seen say fro a year from the Kingston/Halliford days started  "mourning"  me, and saying how much I meant to them and visa versa; like  you  would have made the effort to stay in touch if you cared wouldn't you - Anisha et al.  Ian's work interview went swimmingly from what I gathered, and so now he will probably be designing pickey buildings in a place  near you  at a close point in the future. Hoorah, I bet everyone will appreciate the dildo shaped buildings and cock shaped rooves, as it drugingly becomes the archetypical  fashion  for 2004. This all calmed him down from yesterday, where Dan once again showed his true colors with "oh I'm too knackered to take part in football in 5 hours after my devastating 4 hour shift I've just come of" routine. Some people will never change their  slyness . xBuBzx
