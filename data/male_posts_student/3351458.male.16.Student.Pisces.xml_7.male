Holidays have taken on a new meaning for me. I mean, since when does a 14-day holiday involve 7 days of debate training? Since when did holidays involve 12 days of endless tuition? Add to that, the blistering amounts of homework, and what do you have? A great holiday.  Yeeahhh right . I still intend to enjoy. I've stopped caring about my homework. Let it take care of itself. I'm sick and tired of working my ass off finishing it and all I get in return is a full-scale blasting in front of 39 other 16-year olds by my confounded History teacher. Come on, a guy like me, who is so used to not having a life, suddenly has a 1,000 things to do, another 3,000 things to complete and about 40,000 things I've forgotten to do sometime ago and have to catch up with now. My circle of friends seem to have shrunk as well. My social life now is limited entirely to five other people. The debate teacher and the other debaters. Don't get me wrong. Those guys are great. But their social circles seem to be growing, while my social circle seems to be struggling to even stay a circle.  I need social healing, if there ever was such a thing. Apparently, people nowadays have handphones so they can leave it to rot at home. Can't even have a chat with ANYONE anymore. It's pretty pathetic, when you consider the fact that the only person I'm currently actively messaging with is a person I haven't even seen in my life. Forget seeing that person, I barely even know her name! If this person (who claims she is a girl and insists on calling me her litte bro), turns out to be er, something else, I'm screwed. Come on guyz, put those h/ps to use!!!   "The Darkness is a great band"    Fusion16 , giving another of his useless quotes.
