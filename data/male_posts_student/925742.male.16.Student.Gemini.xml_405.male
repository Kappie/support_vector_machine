I'm just selfish, though.... ehh. ~~~~~~~~ Ok, lets snap out of it, Wes, keep cool, no matter how much you may want to spend to with your sig. other, you have a blog to write....  and write I shall.  I saw The Last Samurai, which was a good movie, the Ninjas, however, made it good.  One day, I hope to attain such a level of badassity, where I can walk around, hiss-breathing (sooo coool) with a shirt around my head to emulate a ninja cowel.  Then it hits me, on a philosophical level, like the archdevil Mephistopheles himself had hurled his giant red fist into my face, I can't do that.    I know I may say that if I believe in something, I can do it.  Here's the catch..... do I want to become a fighter, one who is jing tao (way of the warrior) like my brother? He dropped out of formal education, and now pursues gung fu.  I'm happy that he is happy and can live on the minimum with that.  He centers his chi, and doesn't need a woman or much else as many others would.  He can live without distraction.  Its just... I don't think I want that for myself.  Although its his peace...... its.. not my own.  Although I have learned much of the East thanks to him (and *others* heheh) and even can recognize some han-zi (only the cool ones, but its Chinese, none the less!) and can fight well, and I can list so many advantages I have taken with this path.... its still not mine.  Fighting may have been a way of life for Miyamoto Musashi, but thats many centuries ago...... in Japan.  I want whats best for me.... here.... in this time, in this place.    That means I *MUST* get a formal education if I ever want a job that can pay well in terms of how *I* want to live.  I need distractions, I want a partner, I like the car and all the gadgets, call me a consumer whore.  I know I'm not as bad as many, and I surely know of the ways of going without.  I choose to live in the best way for me.  Not only is that job well paying, but noble.  Much like myself :)    Here's a hint..... it gladdens my heart to know that I really am smiling in the hospital and have the balls to be around all those sick people.... they need people like me... who care.. and are intelligent.   Hint over, I think I would make a great doctor.  Really.  Thats what I believe in.  Fighting is NOT a way of life in this western society.  Its merely defense and a hobby, and I will view it as such.  I wish Derek the best of luck in his endevours, because although he won't make much money doing god knows what his job will be, he'll be at peace.  I hope that one day I can achieve that peace with what I want.  I think I have conveyed my message with some point of clarity..... hold on, I'm trying to sift it out of there.. ah yes....  My destiny lies not with the old traditions, but with helping others in the new.  I choose new, because making a living in this part of the world is easier for me with all the consumerism and oppertunities... I am familiar with it.  You can't make much money and live well by teaching gung fu.  Its a fact.  But whatever, I think its cool and will continue practicing it as a martial skill, not life, as my life lies with knowledge, learning, helping others, and having distractions.  Have I said what I meant to??  So much stuff on my mind....  ~~~~~~~ thats why I want to talk to you in person......alone........ because, after all  '70% of communication is body language".  Its so much better than the phone or typing... hmm hmm hmm, I am suffering withdrawls of being with you. ~~~~~~~ If anyone can interperet what I am trying to say in this blog, cool, you understand what I mean.
