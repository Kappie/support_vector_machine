Tyke was awoken by Macaroon at 11:30 by his phone call.  Macaroon seemed surprised that he was still asleep even though Tyke told him repeatedly yesterday that he would be sleeping til then at least.  Tyke got up after a little bit and took a shower.  Then he went over and picked up the phone and called up Macaroon.  So they got together at his house.  Dr. Phil and Kinker, and Tyronius all joined up too.  Maniak even came over.  They played a little Halo and then left for Cougar Ridge.  Tyke was not on his dominating game.  He couldn't totally use his size advantage as he didn't really have one but that certainly wasn't an excuse.  On one of the first shots Tyke went up for a rebound and got his right ring finger jammed.  Then a shot later or two he had the same thing happen to the same finger.  So it was really hurting.  He took it easy for a little while after that.  Later on he was playing defense and he took an elbow to the left temple from Maniak.  That made him a little dizzy.  So he got a wee bit banged up during the game.  The way he wrote it in the blog sounds worse than it really was though.  It wasn't like he had to sit out or anything.  His body just hurt some.  But it was still fun.  Even if his finger now has an hourglass figure to it.  After that they hung out for a while longer and then went back to Macaroon's.  That was cool.  They played Halo and cards and danced and had a jolly time.  Tyke, Kinker, and Dr. Phil went out to dinner at Burger King and then came back to the house to pick up the rest of the gang on their way to the girls basketball game.  It was a fun game.  The girls won of course and Tyke really enjoyed the atmosphere.  They beat Sly Lion so that was just an added bonus.  After the game Tyke went with the crew back to Macaroon's and then to Cougar Ridge for some midnight bball.  Then they headed off to Dr. Phil's for some more fun.  They played Halo and just hung out until they left.  It was a really fun day but Tyke doesn't really feel like blogging.  But he did text both Dotti and Purdy and since they are both gone he can't see them so that was pleasurable.  Well, short blog, short day.  Or at least it felt short.  Sunday is coming up.  Actually it's here.
