The atheist professor of philosophy pauses before his class and then asks one of his new students to stand.  You're a Christian, aren't you, son?"  "Yes sir," the student says.  "So you believe in God?"  "Absolutely."  "Is God good?"  "Sure! God's good."  "Is God all-powerful? Can God do anything?"  "Yes."  "Are you good or evil?"  "The Bible says I'm evil."  The professor grins knowingly.  "Aha! The Bible!" He considers for a moment.  'Here's one for you. Let's say there's a sick person over here and you can cure him. You can do it. Would you help them? Would you try?"  "Yes sir, I would."  "So you're good...!"  "I wouldn't say that."  "But why not say that? You'd help a sick and maimed person if you could. Most of us would if we could. But God doesn't."  The student does not answer, so the professor continues. "He doesn't, does he? My brother was a Christian who died of cancer, even though he prayed to Jesus to heal him. How is this Jesus good? Hmmm? Can you answer that one?"  The student remains silent.  "No, you can't, can you?" the professor says. He takes a sip of water from a glass on his desk to give the student time to relax.  "Let's start again, young fella. Is God good?"  "Er... Yes," the student says.  "Is Satan good?"  The student doesn't hesitate on this one. "No."  Then where does Satan come from?"  The student falters. "From... God..."  That's right. God made Satan, didn't he? Tell me, son. Is there evil in this world?"  "Yes, sir."  "Evil's everywhere, isn't it? And God did make everything, correct?"  "Yes."  "So who created evil?"  Again, the student has no answer.  "Is there sickness? Immorality? Hatred? Ugliness. All these terrible things, do they exist in this world?"  The student squirms on his feet. "Yes."  "So who created them?"  The student does not answer again, so the professor repeats his question,  "Who created them? "  There is still no answer. Suddenly the lecturer breaks away to pace in front of the classroom. The class is mesmerized.  "Tell me," he continues. "Do you believe in Jesus Christ, son? The student's voice betrays him and cracks.  "Yes, professor. I do."  The old man stops pacing. "Science says you have five senses you use to identify and observe the world around you. Have you ever seen Jesus?"  "No sir. I've never seen Him."  "Then tell us if you've ever heard your Jesus?"  "No, sir. I have not."  "Have you ever felt your Jesus, tasted your Jesus or smelt your Jesus?  Have you ever had any sensory perception of Jesus Christ, or God for that matter.  "No, sir, I'm afraid I haven't."  "Yet you still believe in him?"  "Yes."  "According to the rules of empirical, testable, demonstrable protocol, science says your God doesn't exist. What do you say to that, son?  "Nothing," the student replies. "I only have my faith."  "Yes, faith," the professor repeats. "And that is the problem science has with God. There is no evidence, only faith."  The student stands quietly for a moment, before asking a question of his own.  "Professor, is there such thing as heat?"  "Yes," the professor replies. "There's heat."  "And is there such a thing as cold?"  "Yes, son, there's cold too."  "No sir, there isn't."  The professor turns to face the student, obviously interested. The room suddenly becomes very quiet. The student begins to explain.  "You can have lots of heat, even more heat, super-heat, mega-heat, white heat, a little heat or no heat, but we don't have anything called 'cold'. We can hit 458 degrees below zero, which is no heat, but we can't go any further after that. There is no such thing as cold; otherwise we would be able to go colder than -458 degrees. You see, sir, cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat. We cannot measure cold. Heat we can measure in thermal units because heat is energy. Cold is not the opposite of heat, sir, just the absence of it."  Silence across the room. A pen drops somewhere in the classroom, sounding like a hammer.  "What about darkness, professor. Is there such a thing as darkness?"  "Yes," the professor replies without hesitation. "What is night if it isn't darkness?"  "You're wrong again, sir. Darkness is not something; it is the absence of something. You can have low light, normal light, bright light, flashing light... but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and it's called darkness, isn't it? That's the meaning we use to define the word.  In reality, Darkness isn't. If it were, you would be able to make darkness darker, wouldn't you?"  The professor begins to smile at the student in front of him. This will be a good semester.  "So what point are you making, young man?"  "Yes, professor. My point is, your philosophical premise is flawed to start with and so your conclusion must also be flawed."  The professor's face cannot hide his surprise this time. "Flawed? Can you explain how?"  "You are working on the premise of duality," the student explains.  "You argue that there is life and then there's death; a good God and a bad God. You are viewing the concept of God as something finite, something we can measure. Sir, science can't even explain a thought. It uses electricity and magnetism, but has never seen, much less fully understood either one. To view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing. Death is not the opposite of life, just the absence of it. Now tell me, professor. Do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey?"  "If you are referring to the natural evolutionary process, young man, yes, of course I do."   "Have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes, sir?"  The professor begins to shake his head, still smiling, as he realizes where the argument is going. A very good semester indeed.  "Since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on-going endeavor, are you not teaching your opinion, sir? Are you now not a scientist, but a preacher?"  The class is in uproar. The student remains silent until the commotion has subsided.  "To continue the point you were making earlier to the other student, let me give you an example of what I mean?" The student looks around the room.  "Is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the professor's brain?"  The class breaks out into laughter.  "Is there anyone here who has ever heard the professor's brain, felt the professor's brain, touched or smelt the professor's brain?  No one appears to have done so. So, according to the established rules of empirical, stable, demonstrable protocol, science says that you have no brain, with all due respect, sir. So if science says you have no brain, how can we trust your lectures, sir?"  Now the room is silent. The professor just stares at the student, his face unreadable. Finally, after what seems an eternity, the old man answers.  "I guess you'll have to take them on faith."    If by reading this, and think this would be adequate in answering the questions posed by science to religion, then it would be quite wrong. Some questions which theology can't answer are, the problem of evil, the divinity of christ as well as other sources which contradicts the canonized bible,such as Jesus' alleged marraige to Mary Magdalene.  And on the other hand, there are some things which theology is apparently very comfortable with such as design, the whole "I can't see God so he don't exist" thing. Actually the whole I can't see God is very passe, esp. with the advent of quantum physics as well as some philosophical schools of thought such as phenomenology or universal constructionism. Anyway.....here's why it is flawed, i mean the thing above.  Ok, so the first thing the professor challeneged the student is on the problem of evil, really really sticky stuff. So, the authour painted the student as the "turn the other cheek" kinda student at first. Ok, so whatever, student gets trashed, and the things which get challenged is basically the problem of evil, which theology cannot find any adequate answer to.  So, ok, the professor very satisfied as the enemy did not launch any counter-attack, he touched on the whole "I can't see God so he don't exist" thing. So, after that, the student countered back as to why, y'noe that this whole thing is passe. And he countered the whole evil argument with the whole absence of light thing.  And note that he countered the evil argument first, as the authour writes it. And it providesa less than satisfactory answer to it, it hints at free will, which i believe that is a popular but kinda crap argument if you look at it. Why can't God design free-will without letting evil in? He can do anything, even though we can't understand how such 2 supposedly contradictory entities can co-exist, after all, human thought is finite.  Ok, so counter-argument done, anyway, the evil argument is still left very much inconclusive. And the whole I can't see God thing is countered brilliantly by the student, which imo, is not too difficult. Just give something about how seeing a particle would alter its momenta and position, and in fact everything about it, and that wave packets would be more adequate, giving rise to uncertainty. Ok, in short, countering the whole I can't see God is a piece of cake.  So, the authour puts this piece of cake counter-argument as the conclusion, hoping to mask the inability to counter the evil argument, and note the big words when countering it, the whole thing about empirical evidence and something about protocol, and the whole thing about electricity and magnetism.  And tada, christianity wins the day. So, here's is an example of rhetoric courtesy of the christian church, dissected by me. Thank you very much.  And also, i'll digress abit. Well, I know that electricity exists because if I stick my fingers into the mains socket, I'll get my ass fried, so well, I know for sure electricity exists. And well, Faraday did a few experiements to confirm the nature of electricity and magnetism, so i know it exists. Einstein did the whole photo-electric thing, so I know that everything is both a particle and a wave yada yada. But God did an experiment called creating this whole universe, so we know that he/she/it/ exists.   but for one thing, the church knows nuts about HOW the earth was created, so don't act as if you guys know alot, among many others. And Plato, concluded that he was the smartest guy around because he was the only one who could admit that he didn't really know anything. And judging from history, the church must have been very dumb....
