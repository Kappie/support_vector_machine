Then, after we had lunch, I went to catch a 12:00 noon Mass at Church. After that, we drove about 45 minutes to Beverly Hills where Rodeo Drive was. There were a lot of great shops there and of course, expensive. I think the best part being in Beverly Hills was seeing all those really rich people and the people had Porsches, Mercedes’, and BMWs. We walked out of Rodeo Drive with absolutely nothing, but it was a great experience because I have never been there before (yes, I know it’s ironic even though I lived there for about 10 years). After all that hoopla, we went back to the hotel and rested for a while before dinner at 6 PM. Yes, we had Chinese food again and it was really good. It’s a shame I have to leave tomorrow and go back to that hot city called Phoenix. =P
