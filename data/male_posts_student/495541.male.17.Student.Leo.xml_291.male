They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts.  Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves  over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, with continual lust for more. - Ephesians 4:17-19  Wow.
