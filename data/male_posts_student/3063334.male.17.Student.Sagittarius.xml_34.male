I read this particular interesting thing in the passage that implied you need to be a "good teacher" , to actually use all the positive aspects of Huck Finn and teach more about the truth of slavery. One needs to teach Huck Finn in conjuction to the historical period behind it. An "insensitive teacher" may allow the racial impacts the word has on the students in the classroom goes unchecked, and allow students to "read aloud" in the classrooms.  But "on the contrary, studies have shown that, in the hands of a good teacher, the novel can actually have a positive impact on racial attitudes and increase in interracial understanding. I agree with the fact that if you don't see the true picture of that period in history, to see the life of a "common man", and use the language they use back then, one can not grasp a true concept of. And of course all of this have to be carefully studied in conjuction to a great understanding of the history of slavery and slave trading. That's why having the book in elementary and middle school is probably not a good idea. Because the kids then can't get ironies, satires, and the historical behind why Twain wrote this book and used the bad words to portrait the truth.
