BOLLOCKS!  if it didnt matter you wouldnt say it - i mean c'mon if your gonna tell me i need to get out - just say i do dont hide it and try and tone it down behind some stress bullshit...i sick of this constant "its ok" attitude then undoing all of that by telling me i've got to get out the house! its just not making sense...i've gotta drive, gotta go to university, gotta go to aber-bloody-rysthweth, gotta do essays, gotta make mum "proud", gotta choose a career, gotta be the best - this constant bloody struggle to be something i'm not - or something that other people want me to be...I cant live my life - i'm being pushed around by everyone to just live a life thats not to my taking....its rediculas - i need a direct and calling of my own.  I cant find anything thats particularly interesting to me - almost nothing interestes me - i've just lost confidence since that baker letter - being in the Civil Service is looking futher and further away, Business look like it could be fun but I'm not into all the paperwork and stuff - i just dont have a calling!  hehe this blog is turning into my lil counciling session isnt it? i mean it might be open to the world but it just lets me pour our all my worries and problems, stresses and opinions...  argh bollocks i'm gonna walk over to marco's
