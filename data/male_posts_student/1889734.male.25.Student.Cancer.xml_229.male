"The Democrats' urgent need for an 'exit strategy' apparently first arose sometime after 1993, when Bill Clinton sent all those U.S. soldiers to Bosnia -- who are still there. The Democrats' conception of a 'plan' is like the liberal fantasy that there's a room somewhere full of unlimited amounts of 'free' money that we could just give to teachers and hospitals and poor people and AIDS sufferers and the homeless if only the bad, greedy Republicans would give us the key to that wonderful room. Republicans should claim the 'plan' is in that room. In a lockbox. "
