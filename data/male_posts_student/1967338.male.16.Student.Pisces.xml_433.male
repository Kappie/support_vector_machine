Actually after telling people that you actually made it onto the blog, I was responded with two 'awesome's and one 'what the hell is that little mofo doing here.' I won't *cough* Erin *cough* mention any names, but it's too bad that there's still such evil in this world.  I don't remember what else I was going to- THOMAS! I HAVE TO GO!  Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.
