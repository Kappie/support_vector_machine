I haven't added anything recently that brought the feeling of "Wow, that shit is WEIRD!" for a long while.  This post isn't anything like that either.  Here's my small gripe (I just have so gosh darn many...)  I recently recieved word that I was to be interviewed for our  urlLink school newspaper  (the one I wanted to work on) for an article about blogs.  The blog was to be done by Connie and Joe.  I, and some others were to be questioned and have our URLs added to a list in the paper.  My blog, and  urlLink Joe's , have parental guidence warnings next to them.  Needless to say, otherwise this wouldn't be a gripe,  urlLink Connie's blog  doesn't.   Wait, I'm sorry, gripe wasn't the word I wanted...  Ah, it was gratitude.  Nothing says "COME HERE DAMNIT!" like a parental warning sign (being such a threatening thing) published in a school newspaper (being such a censored thing) next to your name with a link.  I'll do my best to bring you the writing that so needs a parental warning.  All the words, insults, opinions, and brutal daydreams will spew forth and absorb you, like no other has before (empty promises).  Thank you, brave censors of Hoover. Thank you Ms. Pon. Thank you irony. And I'll stop before this sounds like an Alanis Morrisette song.
