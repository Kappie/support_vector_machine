In an endearing way, I mean, she's OK when sedated. Needless to say, my cat wasn't taking too kindly to this. But she's getting better, with me being her moral cord and all. - School starts on the day after tomorrow. That's bad news. We don't have to take those damn brats next door. That's good news. Our classes are 'abbreviated' on Tuesday. That's good news. Alot of my friends will be gone on the first week of school. That's bad news. In short about the first day:   Meh.   - I read that we don't get our class rings on th first week of school. That really sucks. I want my class ring, darn it. They pushed back the last date of payment, so I think that's part of the reason. Listen, you slackers: if you can't afford it, don't get the farking ring! You ruin it for those of us who can.  There's  why socialism doesn't work. It brings everything down to the lowest common denominator. [/rant off] - I'm wanting an iPod. You may be, too. But for pete's sake, don't do that dumb "free iPod" scam ring. OK?
