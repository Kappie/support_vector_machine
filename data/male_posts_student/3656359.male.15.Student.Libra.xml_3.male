But this will give us hope, we almost won the game, not the rubbish kind of almost winning where we took the lead after 5 minutes then concede two goals 15 minutes later.  Tonight we shall win, we should retain the same team that almost conquered the champions, im thinking 2-0 England with Rooney and Owen gettin a goal each, im hoping for that A cos i want them to win, and B cos Steph thinks its gonna be 3-1 and we got a bet on!!  WRESTLING NEWS-I believe that Rey mysterio will beat a now fired Chavo Classic for the crusierweight title, im pleased cos my cousin Ross is an absoululty HUGE Mysterio fan!! anyways the Bad Blood 2004 review shouild be posted a bit later, with some thoughts on todays football later m.c
