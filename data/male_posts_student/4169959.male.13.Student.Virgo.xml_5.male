It begins with the 24 minute song, Atom Heart Mother, written by Mason, Gilmour, Waters, Wright, and Geesin. The songs starts with a long time of silence, and the starts with weird sounds and then awesome playing by everybody. The album's second song If, written by Roger Waters, keeps a great guitar playing by David Gilmour and great singing by Roger Waters. The album's third song Summer '68, written by Rick Wright, it has a great guitar playing and singing, and a part of a singing duet and awesome guitar playing, this part keeps popping up thru the whole song. Fat Old Sun, written by David Gilmour, is a gret song from David Gilmour. A combination of his great voice, guitar, drums, keyboards, and bass. The best part is the electric guitar solo. The final song Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast, written by Mason, Gilmour, Waters, and Wright, doesn't have any lyrics, but is great with the sounds of Alan cooking breakfast and keyboards. This song is the first and I think only of its kind. Switching from Pink Floyd playing, to Alan in the kitchen. This album was founded off of the fact that a woman had a atom for a heart. -Richard Dasher
