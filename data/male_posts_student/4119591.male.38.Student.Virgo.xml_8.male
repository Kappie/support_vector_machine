In a statement, Lee said he "no longer believes that Viacom deliberately intended to trade on my name when naming Spike TV."   One reason might be that  Spike isn't his name !  "As an artist and a filmmaker, I feel that protection of freedom of expression is a critical value, and I am concerned that my efforts to stop Viacom from using the Spike TV name could have the unintended consequence of threatening the First Amendment rights of Viacom and others," Lee said in a statement.   What a pile of dingo's kidneys. He's had this sudden turnabout because Viacom is going to give him some shows on MTV. The president of Spike TV, Albie Hecht, offered up this gem:  "Spike and Tonya Lee have a relationship with MTV Networks," Hecht said. "There are development situations that are in place that could potentially be broadened."   The Hecht with it. Somebody, please bring me a shovel. Conspiracy theorists might conclude that Viacom and Lee planned all of this to raise awareness (and financial opportunities) in both camps. So, by repeating all of it here, I might actually be helping their cause! You're welcome.  The terrorists are winning.
