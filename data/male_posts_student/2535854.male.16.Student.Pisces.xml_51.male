Others see you as an exciting, highly volatile, rather impulsive personality; a natural leader, who's quick to make decisions, though not always the right ones. They see you as bold and adventuresome, someone who will try anything once; someone who takes chances and enjoys an adventure. They enjoy being in your company because of the excitement you radiate.    About your score... The closer to fifty that the number is, the stronger your personality is. The closer to zero that the number is, the weaker your personality. The best scores to have are between 25 and 40.  Your are(me) 75% in control of your life.  what does that mean?  You have a healthy mix of internal drive and belief in external forces (fate, your friends, coworkers, luck). You know when something is your job, and if you want it to turn out good, you will work on it. You also know when something is beyond your control, and you're usually OK with that.
