Everyday after school I would go to a café and drink nine coffees and smoke a pack of cigarettes. I went to an all boy school so the reason for the café had everything to do with meeting girls. The girls that would show up went to an all girl school. We had a dress code, they had a uniform; we showed up looking perfectly dishevelled with messy  I-don't-care-about-anything  hair, crooked, loose ties, shirts slightly untucked; they showed up in knee socks and quilts rolled up at the waist raising the hemlines to reveal more thigh than their mothers knew they had. It was a meeting of the over-privileged, under-challenged, horny teenagers. We smiled, we teased, we brooded, we laughed; we flirted.    One day a girl showed up that didn't look anything like the others: her skin was darker than everyone else's, she was shorter than everyone else, and her breasts were larger than everyone else's. She was exotic. Her father was a Jew from Morocco, her mother a pur laine Francophone from a working-class town in Northern Quebec. She was the first hardcore feminist I ever met. She indicted us boys for being the inheritors of a patriarchy she despised. We didn't even know what a patriarchy was. Our two primary interests were getting laid and getting stoned. This half-breed with the acid tongue was new to us and we hated her for it. Afternoons of flirting were replaced with afternoons of arguing. I was the most vocal arguer, and the most articulate. She and I were the most intelligent of the group, and the most willing to smash heads.    One day I actually won an argument. I'm not sure what it was about. But she started hitting me, lightly at first, punching and slapping my arms and chest. I don't think she lost her temper, I think it was more a kind of flirting than anything else. But as she kept swinging I kept telling her to stop and when that didn't work I started making fun of her. I said cruel things, made cutting observations about her personality. And then she did lose her temper, she started hitting me for real. I told her if she didn't stop hitting me I was going to hit her back. She told me I wasn't allowed to hit girls. I told her that if she wanted equality of the sexes than she was going to get it. Then I punched her. Once, in the arm. She screamed. She started crying. She got up and left. Everyone laughed, everyone thought it was funny.    The next day she came back, but didn't stay long. She stopped by just to show me the baseball-sized bruise I had left on her. Then she stormed out. I followed her. I apologized. We talked for a long time. And after that, we were good friends. She started to mellow out, she stopped verbally assaulting the inheritors of the patriarchy.    Later, during the summer, we started dating.    Fast forward to the winter. Maybe February. I guess we would have been dating for nine months or so. The relationship wasn't going well, we were constantly bickering -- and not about big things, like gender roles, but about little things, like her cats. I'm allergic to cats. Not very allergic to cats. But she had four cats, and her entire place was covered with fur. I would complain about the cats, she would tell me to take an antihistamine. I would, but was never comfortable in her place, I always felt slightly ill. We also argued about slightly bigger things than that. One time I was over at her place with a mutual friend of ours. We were in the backyard hanging out when she decided she was going to show our friend how to play the violin. Being allergic to her house, I stayed inside while they went in to fetch her instrument. I assumed they would be coming right back out, but moments later I heard the horrible screech of a violin in untrained hands. I went inside. She was standing on a chair, standing behind our friend, her arms were wrapped around him, her lips were right next to his ear, she was trying to show him how to hold the violin. We fought about it later, I told her she was all over him while she maintained she was innocent.    A week after this incident her mom went out of town for the weekend so I was able to stay over. As much as I didn't want to spend the night in her fur-lined house, the prospect of non-stop sex was enough to convince me otherwise. It was around midnight and we were getting ready for bed. I had been in the house for a few hours already and the antihistamine I had taken was wearing off. We had had another fight so the sex was out. I started sneezing, my eyes were bloodshot, I was feeling miserable. She started berating me for sneezing so much. I told her to stop adopting cats. I told her she was using pets (she also had two dogs) as a pathetic way to find some kind of emotional fulfillment the same way fat people get lonely and head to the fridge. It escalated from there. I was upset because we were fighting over stupidities and I was upset because I clearly wasn't going to be getting any action. Neither of us backed down, we were screaming at each other. She told me to go home. I should have gone home -- no sex, no cuddling, no fun at all, what reason did I have to stay? My pride was hurt though, I was actually being thrown out of someone's home -- my girlfriend's no less -- so I refused to go. She started pushing me towards the door but she couldn't budge me. I was at least a foot taller than her, I wasn't going anywhere. Then I lost my temper. I picked her up and threw her across the room. Thankfully she landed safely on the couch. But the deed was done, I had crossed a line. She started crying, she started hyperventilating. I had won the power struggle. She looked so helpless sitting on the couch. I went to comfort her. Her cheeks red with tears, she looked up at me and in a soft voice said, "Please Jeff, just go." I felt sick, I felt like I was going to vomit. She wasn't screaming at me to leave anymore, her venom was gone; she was instead softly pleading for me to go. I left. I was devastated. I was unable to believe what I had done. I went home.    More than two years later I found myself at a rough punk rock bar. I got very drunk. Some creep started hitting on a girl in my group of friends. She told him to go away and he did. But he kept coming back. As we were leaving he pinned her to a wall. My friends and I quickly ripped him off her. We left, we walked down the street. About a block away from the bar the creep started screaming at us. We should have just kept walking, we should have ignored him. Actually, that's precisely what everyone did, except for me. I turned around and started screaming back at him. My friends kept walking, I was standing alone when he started running at me. Pretty soon fists were flying. I got in a few punches but they didn't seem to affect him at all. A buddy of his joined in. Before long I was on the ground and they were both kicking me. I remember wondering where my glasses were, hoping they weren't broken. Thankfully the police showed up and pulled them off of me. One of the cops let me go get my glasses, they were in the middle of the street. Nobody got arrested, they just gave us a talking to and let us go. I caught up with my friends. They didn't realize what had happened, they were a block away in a coffee shop waiting for me.    I caught a cab home with a friend. I didn't have any money so I only went as far as his place. I walked the rest of the way home. In the cabbie's rear-view mirror I checked myself out and I didn't seem to be in too bad shape, considering what had happened. I was just a bit scuffed up, and there was some dried blood underneath my left ear, but all-in-all I didn't look too bad.     I was almost home when I started crying. It caught me by surprise. It wasn't the physical pain -- I was still very drunk after all. I started talking out loud, I kept saying, "I'm sorry" over and over. She had forgiven me the day after I threw her. We made up, we had a long talk that spanned several hours. We had excellent make-up sex. We dated for another eight months. Battered and bruised, I resolved that night to call her and apologize again, though I never did. The next day I woke up with a black eye and a swollen knee. I actually started a new job that same day -- thankfully my boss was a nice guy and didn't figure me for the type of guy who got into bar fights on a regular basis. He sent me home and told me to come back in for training in a couple days when I was feeling better.    I still see this ex-girlfriend around sometimes. We never talk -- every time I spot her I head in the opposite direction. I bumped into her at a bar a few days ago though, we actually talked for a few minutes. She said she would come around to my table later and hang out for a bit. I convinced the people I was with to leave, and we did so immediately.
