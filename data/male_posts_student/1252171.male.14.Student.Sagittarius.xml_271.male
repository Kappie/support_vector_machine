Many things contributed:  1)Homework 2)Homework 3)An awesome new anime called "Azumanga Daioh" 4)Ordered an Excel Saga DVD  To make up for it, I bring you:   SA2B's  GANG    Episode 4 "The Pheonix Cometh"  One night, everyone was calmly sleeping in their beds, when suddenly the wall bursts open (Useless fact: this is the first time this has happened)! Everyone is thrown from their beds to the opposite wall. "What in the frick was that?" asks Sa2b. "That would be me," said a mysterious voice from within the smoke. "And you would be?" inquires Camo. "SHUT UP! I was getting to that. My name," says the voice, as a giant robot housing a red-striped orange weasel steps out of the smoke,"is MACK!" "Corrnyyy..." Katt says, under her breath. "Say that again and I'll make your death even slower and more painful than originally!" says Mack. But before Sa2b and friends can react, the robot explodes from behind and Mack is sent flying into the sky. "Okay, stereotypical bad guy phrase. Umm... CURSE YOOU!!" Mack yells. As the dust clears, a large flaming bird is seen with a lone figure inside of it, and then flies off. While everyone wonders exactly what just happened, Knumchuck has a perfect understanding of it.   To be continued...   Today's episode has been brought to you by Dr. Pepper, the special effects budget of Et Cetera Inc.! -Sane Intolerant-
