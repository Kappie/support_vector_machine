Please, I will stick to juice. 3) Reading- I do intend to start "What Your Dog Can Teach You About Living A Happy Life" (co-written by a local author) - I'm guessing that I won't find "Eating Socks" as one of the chapters, right? 4) Thinking - Things could be worse, I could be Martha Stewart 5) Doing – Chewing off two bad fingernails (don't worry, they had it coming) Bonus: Aren’t I exciting?  What do your shoes say about you?  I feel that shoes are a good preliminary indicator of personality, especially here in nyc. What kicks you flash usually give off certain clues to your character (i.e. whether you are laid back and chill, open-minded, uptight, unoriginal, etc.) Here's my attempt at psychoanalyzing the wearers of various popular brands: Kenneth Cole- You have a stuffy personality. Originality and imagination are not your strong points.  Prada- You're high maintenance and you either: (a) like to flaunt your daddy's wealth, or  (b) are probably asian and can't afford the shoes, but buy them anyway to make everyone think you're flaunting your daddy's wealth, which of course, is amassed through the family liquor store or dry-cleaning business. (Buy me a pair! Fine, I see how it is.) Pony- You are a fairly laid back and open-minded person (I own a pair! They frickin’ rock) Adidas- I represent the old school, but in actuality, I'm just a poser who is really reppin' the new school trendiness of going old-school.  (I have these as well) Diesel-I'm trendy and gay! (I own none, I wanna pair though…hmm...) Campers- You have a good sense of humor. You kind of have to in order to wear something that looks like smurf shoes. (1 pair) Nike- I'm a conformist (1 old pair due to ex's influence, who, by the way, was the poster-child for conformity). New Balance- The old people who wore them years before they got popular are down-to-earth. The young people that now buy them - see Nike/Diesel (Awww crappers!  A pair) Aasics- Health conscious; serious runners. Reebok- you're Mexican. 'Really-Long-And-Pointy-Heels' every chick has bought in the past 2 years (e.g. witch shoes)- I watch too much Sex and the City and need to stop playing make-believe with my girlfriends when we go out on Saturday nights. (One pair, j/k, j/p!  No, really I don’t.  I don’t fine don’t believe me.) Knee-High Leather Boots- I'm easy and I love attention. So there you have it. You may not agree with me on some or all points, but do I really give a poot?  You're a good man, Charlie Brown! Sitting in class. Waiting for something great to happen. I'm dreaming my life away. I'll bet most of you didn't know that I suffer from a debilitating disease. Yes, you heard correctly. I've been diagnosed with... wanderlust. A sexy word, no doubt, but devastating nonetheless. Even the simplest tasks seem impossible to accomplish for those that suffer from wanderlust. I constantly dream of traveling to far off places I've never been to or into the great wilderness, when instead I should be paying attention to how much this teacher is trying to reach out to me, washingthe dishes piling up in my kitchen, or studying. Bo-ring!  But, alas I have to live this mundane life… So, if anyone out there has any suggestions for a washed-up never-has-been student...then please, let me hear it. Here are my skills to help with recommendations: 1. An amatuer popper and locker (essentially a different form of breakdancing) 2. I like to cook. 3. I speak fluent German, some French, Old English, and Hittie.  (Two dead langauages! What know? Huh?) 4. I am very confident when it comes to public speaking and sociable when conversing with strangers. 5. I can be very convincing. (Example: 'Dude, send me some money. No, for reals. Send me some money.' You can't teach that. That's all me.) 6. I can dance like a girl, but well I am not. 7. Yoga? 8. I can touch my nose to my knees standing up not bending my legs and can do a back bend! 9. I can get in fights with trees and lose miserably. 10.  I am me! Bonus skill: typing "bonus" entries in every top 5 category I've ever produced on this blog.
