And all of this occurs as the background to something that I decided on today.  You know those whiny teen support groups for various causes?  Well I've decided to join one.  Well, tentatively decided to tentatively join one.  Now what cause could Mike possibly have to join a whiny support group, you say?  Mike likes guys.  Mike is uncertain whether he likes girls.  He probably does.  But that could change in the future.  Consider this my metaphorical "Initial public offering."  Anyway, so I've been doing some research, and monday I'll probably go down to the "center on Halsted," which is apparently number one GLBT community center in Chicago.  Maybe it will have to wait.  We shall see.  Wednesday that pride group meets at Links.  I might go to that.  We'll see how things work out.  Then there's the issue of my parents.  Hmm, so complicated.  Cheers, -Mike  "Rockin' the suburbs, just like Rufus Wainwright does..."
