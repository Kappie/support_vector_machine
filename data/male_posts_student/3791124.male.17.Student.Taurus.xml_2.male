Adam, Rosy, Mike, Elyssa, the garbage man down the street; the cute one with the farmer hat and boyish looks; a friendly bloke lost in the intricate designs of a railroad tie.  Yes, tie.  I might’ve seen Jesus roam through a mall rat-crowd, had it not been for the boyish farmer/garbage man.   Adam’s a keeper.  Not in a serious relationship way, but in a friendly way.  Definitely, although he isn’t too shabby lookin’.    He was totally not the person I expected him to be.  It tells me not to judge a book by its cover, or shitty review out of a Reader’s Digest (Ex-Boyfriend, tee hee).    I remember that day in Denny’s when I first talked to him.  Holy shit I thought I was going to go up in flames.  I’m gay, I admit, but there is a difference between gay, and ghey.  I couldn’t stand to hear his flamboyant voice for another second.    That weasel face is  not  looking at  me .  Oh you are ugly.    Yeah now we’re cool, and he can look at me all he wants.  Now the weasel look is in, and the flamboyant act is out.  Add some bud, and the blunt is growing; I mean glowing.
