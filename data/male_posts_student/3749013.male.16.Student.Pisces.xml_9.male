Ah Fong helped me by giving my class a geography test today. Due to the lack of time to study, I panicked last night, wondering who I could turn to for tips. Luckily, I signed in to MSN Messenger, and saw her online. I knew that her class had taken the paper on monday, so I plucked my courage and tried asking her for tips on the test. She gave me tips, which I found out to be very accurate during today's test. I also felt very guilty for not trusting her exactly, as I asked another friend today for extra tips... When I found out that her tips were pin point during today's test, I went into a state of shock. I hated myself on the spot for not trusting her 100%... Damn... I haven't thank her personally today...  I would like to thank Jay because while chatting with her last night, I told her that I was going to get Jay's new album today. She immediately asked me to burn a copy for her, which, of course, I agreed without even flinching. I slept late last night, studying, and partly due to her face appearing every once in a while in my mind, which inadvertently caused me to sleep during Yeow's class and during the geography test today. Luckily I wasn't caught by Yeow, if not, I would not be typing this blog...  I'm glad that I volunteered to help (friend C) to accompany him to see his girl. I went to get Jay's album immediately after school and rushed back to school to meet him. He told me previously that his class would be releasing at 3.30pm, but his english teacher insisted that their class complete their composition before being allowed to leave. To me, a composition may be a child's play, but this may not be the case for others. (Friend C) is one of the others, unfortunately. Due to my passion for english, I offered to accompany them by doing the composition with them. Did I mention that (friend C) is in the same class with her? I slipped into their class somehow to guide (friend C) in his composition. I saw her struggling with her composition too, yet I'm too timid to get close to her. When she finished, (friend C) tried to help me by asking me to double check her work. After reading a few sentence, she came and snatched the paper back. I think it's maybe because of the wrong message I sent her on monday. When everything's almost done, I told her that I'll pass the cd to her tomorrow. Then, she said the cutest "THANK YOU!!!" I've ever heard in my life. These simple words may not affect others, but to me, it was like I struck gold.  Well, tomorrow would be a beautiful day, as I'd be passing her the cd I promised, (friend C) also helped me again today by asking her out for 'cutlet outing' tomorrow. (Friend C) promised to give her a treat tomorrow, but he told me later that I'll be the one doing the treating then... Well, I'll treat her willingly, even if it costs my whole month's pocket money...  I'll share a life philosophy with you guys today,:" never let a woman pay when you are out with them, especially when the one you love is in the group."
