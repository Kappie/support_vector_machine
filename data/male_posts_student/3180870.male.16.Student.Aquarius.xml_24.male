It's a word that's been used so much and for so long that it's harder to not be described by it than ingesting Crazy Jerry's Brain Damage Hot Sauce (http://www.americanspice.com/catalog/item-50361.html).     Yet, some people still manage to act so atrociously that they don't fit into the five mile wide grey area set by the word cool. Some people are the jerks, the stupid know-it-alls who answer all of the questions with all of the wrong answers, the clever ones, and some are all wrapped into one. I won't go into any descriptions because we all have or will deal with these people at one point or another in our lives. What I would like to do is make a brochure, for the "un-cool". It will have all of the pointers on how to shut up and tips like how to open a door for a woman and locations to the closest discreet clinics. I'm already working very hard on the brochure but what I need from you all are the actual content and a very diverse street team who will spread the word. Please send me feedback at my new email address (luike2@yahoo.com) since as I have mentioned before, I'm not the greatest example of "coolness".  Until I get some feedback, here are some business cards to print and hand out.     By the way, one of the random questions that we're given on our profiles was "How would you live like a frog?". Here's my answer (it was too long for the box). I would live it like a regular frog, eating flies, burping, killing curious children with my poisonous skin, and pulling in money for the syndicated Budweiser commercials. It's like asking a frog how it would live as a human. It'd be normal, like the rest of us. When people say they would hate to live as a frog or fish, it's a dumb time for them. Assuming they start over as a frog or fish, they wouldn't remember their past human life, would have nothing to compare their current fly eating to, and therefore would have no reason to be sad, and there would be no notion of anything wrong except when the vibration from the semis come rolling down the road.
