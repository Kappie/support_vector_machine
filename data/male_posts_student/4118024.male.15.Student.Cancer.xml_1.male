Anyways, my name is Rex III, and this is my blog. It's a very fine blog. Yeah...     Anyways, I'm a sophomore in high school. We're in the middle of summer vacation now, but we go back in 3 days. This blog was supposed to be about life at our school, and how f***ed up it is. I changed it though, because my life is much more interesting.    Here's what's happened in the past few days...  I was the main guy in a film studio called S3 Films, and I had been for a little over a year (I started the whole thing!), but I decided to abruptly leave when I got an e-mail from my best friend (not sure anymore) Simon, saying that I had been getting a swelled-head over the movie thing, that I thought I was proffesor Punk Rock (I am a very avid punk rock fan, favorite bands include Alkaline Trio and Bad Religion... no radio bands for me anymore, except I do like Yellowcard), and that my scriptwriting sucked, among other things. So I left, right when we were about to finish pre-production on The Quiz of Fighters '99: Neo Dream Match Millenium, a fighting game parody (in the King of Fighters universe) we were working on (I spent a long time doing that script). That movie, sadly, will probably get shafted after the whole studio restructures itself into making Jackass movies (something they've been wanting to do since forever, but I never let them because I consider it selling out), but Simon said they're going to probably make the Splatterhouse movie we just started planning about a week ago.    So basically, what happened today. I went to work. I am a mechanic. Today, I was told I was to change a compressor on a Honda car from the 80's, so I took it out, but then my grandpa (my employer), told me that the car had exhaust problems and that the compressor was in decent shape so I put it back in and began working on the Satan car. That car's been in and out of the shop since I first started working there 6 months ago. Not 2 months can go by before it shows up again. Every time it's been a compressor problem. I've put at least 3 compressors in that thing, and they still don't work, and every time I work on it I swear it's getting harder, or maybe Satan Car's just messing with my mind. No, I am 2 l33t 4 7h47. So I start working on it, and all of a sudden... BOOM!!! Coolant Explosion! Green crap goes everywhere! It was kinda cool. So, I took the compressor out (I had a few encounters with coolant before I finished though... Kids, remember to always use a vacuum to drain all Freon out of a compressor before you take it out!), and went home. Tomorrow I have to put a new compressor in (I give it a month before it comes back), and I have to put new brake pads on it. I hate Satan Car.    Well, that was my entry for today... Come back tomorrow, if Satan Car dosen't swallow my soul first!
