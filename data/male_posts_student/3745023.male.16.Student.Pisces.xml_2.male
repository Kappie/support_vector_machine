Total, I made 45$ this weekend for only 15 hours of work. Hoody hoo! As you can not see my face I will tell you of my sarcasm. I love all this charity work. I also played D+D Saturday for a few hours. Donny convinced us to play J3 instead of J4a. I like Scott’s cataloging system :-). I feel extraordinarily disappointed in my self as the only pertinent information I got this week end was the early change of power in Iraq. *sigh* oh well. George just came on, maybe something good will be on. Sorry to all you inexistent readers who will be disappointed to find that I have failed to post anything of value today.   No word of the day. Quote of the day: Shakespeare, Pompey on the mort de Pompey “All is legitimate in the service of Ceasur.”
