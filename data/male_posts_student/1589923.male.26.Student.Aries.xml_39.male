After almost a year of studies here, i realised there isn't anyone that i am close to and this is clearly evident when it comesto project work where there is hardly anyone i know of. Most of the ppl tend to stick around their own cliques, therefore it is hard for me to actually join the group. urgh. and i hate the feeling of going around asking if any group needsa member. i detest this sort of feeling. makes me feel like an outcast. It is so hard to make frens as most of the time, u hardly have the opportunity to get to know one another thoroughly due the difference in timetable and subjects taken and therefore the only time u see them is through weekly tutorial sessions. that's about it eh. I am going to graduate soon and i can count the number of ppl i know throughout my stay here. pathetic i would. it lacks diversity. whatever the feeling is, i know it is temporary and it will go away but somehow, looking back i can't help but feel the lack of frenships i made. that i find is somewhat of a disappointment.
