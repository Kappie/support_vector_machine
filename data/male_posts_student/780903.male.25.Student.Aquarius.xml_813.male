You gotta trust them states now Come on baby, appoint, elect The founding fathers were correct  Regulating commerce, oh it's so much fun now (Come on baby, read the Constitution) Spending power, taxing power, either one now (Come on baby, read the Constitution) Rights are fundamental under many a clause We have a right to privacy but no one's found a cause So come on, come on, read the Constitution with me.
