Game ever to hit this planet.Ofcourse there are always those critics who say DOOM was better.Well maybe Doom was the game that spawned the FPS genre and all and ofcourse it was really good(at that time).It gave us Multiplayer.It was the begin of a new era of games,the beginning of a genre that would go on to become the most liked and played genre of games.It gave us FPS.It gave us the thirst to blow away Demons. Somehow even though it did start everything Half-Life did better.It was the first FPS to have a strong storyline,the greatest AI yet seen,non-scripted event and ofcourse a modding community and MODS that are yet being played on full flow(CS).Was Doom being played five years after its release(i guess no).Well in the next six months or so HL2 and Doom3(In August)will be released and again we shall all decide which game deserves it.
