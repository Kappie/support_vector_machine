Anyway, if you haven't noticed, I added a new counter, guestbook, and message forum thanks to the solution to all your web design needs: Bravenet. Sign the guestbook please, but I can't ask too much considering I doubt anyone reads this. Its' not a crime to dream though. In football news, if you haven't heard by now, THE GIANTS SUCK! I've been a Giants fan for years now and each year I think to myself "self, maybe this year New York will get their act together. Yeah, this will be a good year." Once again, I think I should stop dreaming since it'll never happen. In basketball news, I'm being positive. The Knicks will make it to the Championship and  WIN!  Although, Keith Van Horn needs to be a little more consistent. When he was on the Sixers, he sucked. Horribly. He had a couple good days but for the better part of the season he blew. Well, he came to New York (against my will) and first game he rips it up. I was amazed. Here was a skinny white boy who averaged about 4 pts in the playoffs last year, and now he's scoring 29 pts for the Knicks. But of course, this didn't last. Dreaming is for losers as I've concluded this past 5 minutes while writing this post. Well, I've also concluded that I suck at bowling. Pretty sad that last year my average was a 127 which sucked and now it dropped to an 88 which sucks even worse. Oh well, maybe if I tried. Naw, there's really no excuse. End post. Listen to H.I.M.
