Horse camping is a lot of fun but it leads to soreness in very unfortunate regions. I think I'm sterile now. It is very cool, however, to experience what was the major form of transportation for thousands of years. It reminds of how much things have changed in the past hundred years or so. Not when it comes to humanity itself, mind you. I don't think the nature of man isany different now thanit wasfour thousand years ago. I went to a concert on Sunday night. It was the first actual concert I've ever been to and, to use common speech, it freakin rocked. Thousand Foot Krutch was themain event, but three other bands played: two local and one from Southern California. They were all awesome, but out of the three openers I have to say I enjoyed Dizmas the most. They were the Southern Cal band and they played Christian metal: lots of screaming and jumping around. It was a lot of fun to watch. The lead singer had dreads and screamed so frequently that his face was a violent shade of red. I thought he was going to have an aneurysm right there on the stage. Then Thousand Foot Krutch took the stage and the small crowd went nuts. I've never been that close to a moshpit before - we kind of formed the perimeter, although Nate the Kid and Darby the German jumped in a few times. It was pretty crazy for a Christian concert. On a side note, I started reading  The Count Of Monte Cristo  a few days ago. I urge you all to go read it. Right now.
