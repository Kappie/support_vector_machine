I'm sitting at a computer right next to a wall rsvping for Mighael's thing with pizza.  When I finish, I just happen to look to my left and what should I see taped to the wall 5 inches from my head?  A paper that explaning what a blog or weB LOG is.  Now is that just about the most creepy and ironic thing you've ever heard or what?!  I mean what are the chances of that?  Maybe I'm just being paranoid or maybe someone just out of earshot is having a good laugh.  All I know is that I need to finish my homework so I'm done.  It is his love, it is his life, it is his fault he didn't lock the garage!
