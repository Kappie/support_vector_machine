Tyke can really see himself looking back on his high-school days and just regretting many things he did and didn't do.  It is one of those things where he really could have just applied himself more in school and that might have paid off or maybe just asking a girl to a dance one year or just anything.  But he has an unfortunate feeling that he has just passed up so many opportunities in life that he will never get back.  And also has made some stupid decisions.  He knows that one thing he could look back on and be disappointed with is that he tried to hard to please other people instead of pleasing himself.  That is something he knows now that he can't get too caught up on though and really it is not an entirely awful thing anyway.  At least someone is getting pleased (*smirk).  Well not sure where that came from but Tyke is in kind of a daze right now for some reason.  Probably because of going to the basketball game against Bellevue tonight.  Of course he saw Tina there.  And it really seems to Tyke that she is being less forward with him.  Kind of avoiding him you could say.  Now, it is hard to say as even pre-The Letter she probably wouldn't have said much if anything to him at the game tonight but Tyke is just piecing things together.  Like today before school he walked next to her on the way to class and she didn't say anything and barely even acknowledged him.  Luckily, Frederique came and was sort of a mutual acquaintance to talk to so they both were laughing and talking but it was still sorta awkward.  But really Tyke is wondering if he did something bad by telling her.  Cuz he is realizing now how much he loves spending any time with her and how it really does lighten up his day no matter how he felt before.  So, you can imagine how troubling it can be when she is there but is not there, if that makes any sense.  And Tyke still tries to make chit-chat but there just isn't always a paddle on the other side hitting the ball back to him (attempted analogy to Pong that probably failed).  Nonetheless, he trudges on and this blog needs to resurge into its superior status once again!  RISE UP MY WONTON!  Lead me to your place of desire!  Four score and seven years ago Tyke Turner was not alive.  Four hours and seven minutes ago Tyke Turner was in a chair eating licorice (both black and red for your information).  The day was normal.  No real excitement.  Dotti (new spelling by the way) and Tyke hung out in 4th period to the chagrin of their 4th period teacher.  Actually, there was no chagrin-ing but they still hung out.  3rd period kinda blew at times.  Other times were alright.  And Haras sat next to Tyke today (gotta mention Haras, come on!).  Good old Amed made a nice comment on mANUS and it just made Tyke think, yeah attaboy.  The best part is hardly anyone heard it.  Those comments are the best.  The sneaky wicked ones that go under the radar of most but get pinged by the sonar of others.  Tyke has good sonar.  He always picks up on things.  That is a lie cuz nobody is an always.  And nobody is a never either.  Everyone lies in the middle of the Something Spectrum.  Tyke is actually planning on maybe going (yeah tough to plan maybes but they can be planned...but not babies [rhymes]).  Well Amed and Kinker might make the trip with him.  That would be cool.  Any ladies dying to make the sensual trip to the cacophonous city of Bellevue?  If so, just sign on the dotted line and then cut your permission slip out and turn it in to Tyke Turner c/o   Hot Guys R Us 123 Fake St.  Anywhere, USA 90210  That should be enough, but make sure you include a $5 deposit.  No CODs but flashing is accepted.  Wow, Tyke is being weird now.  He has totally changed how he is talking and what it is about.  He got pointed out to him how he always talks to himself in his blog but he types it out as if there is some problem with him.  Well...there is...yeah...that's right...you know.  Nothing else blogworthy probably tonight.  Really Tyke's whole life has been demmed blogworthy by him though.  He talks about anything and everything.  As is the life of a kinker...er, blogger.  Sex sells and sex teaches according to Amed and Tyke.  Oh yeah, for english everyone has to write 3 Haikus.  Tyke has already started on his.  He is going to write about his Wonton (wink wink "boing boing") and will most likely do one about Tina.  Hopefully they all turn out well.  He likes writing stuff like that.  He considers himself a great writer when he gets to let loose his imagination and comical side.  But when it is about something stuffy it is just so hard to make it good.  However, that is the sign of a good writer.  Making the bland the grand.  And so on and so forth.  And nobody knows it but me...
