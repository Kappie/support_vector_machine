It was really easy - I missed like two questions maximum on these little obscure grammar things - but the stories weren't as exciting as they ought to have been.  I thought there weren't any deaths, but then Ben Ostrow pointed out that the open-heart surgery person probably died, after all, the doctor obviously had time to make this recording.  We did our skits today in French, ours (Ian and mine) went fairly well.  The best one was Ben and Charlie's group, it was really funny when they found anthrax in the mail.  I'm annoyed that a certain someone won't talk to me in person unless it's important.  I just have so many reasons, it seems like such a given that we could talk, it's like too obvious to even try to explain.  Maybe she just doesn't want to be seen talking to me.  Whatever, but I'm not the one who wants to punish poor people "for being lazy."  A few days ago I got some advice that contradicted the themes of a lot of my earlier advice.  I don't know what to do, so I'll probably end up doing nothing - which is exactly what this new advisor wants me to do apparently.  Badminton with Dan Jung is so fun.  This is so much better than AM Gym.
