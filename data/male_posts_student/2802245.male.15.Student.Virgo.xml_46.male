I'm going to America tomorrow,       Which means I'll have to get up at 6 so I can get on a coach for 10 hours...      :(      But I won't be posting till I get back, so be patient, (like you want to read the crap I write :P)      Anyway, there's always the miniscule possibility that the other two stooges will actually post...      (Jamie, Don't complain about it being a one man show if you aren't going to contribute, ditto to Simon)      Emma, hope you have a nice flight back...      (even if it's just so I won't have to make a bad airplane joke)      And I shall see you all on Wednesday, when I will no longer be cut off from civilisation...      Damn that felt like I was writing my will or something :/      Meh...
