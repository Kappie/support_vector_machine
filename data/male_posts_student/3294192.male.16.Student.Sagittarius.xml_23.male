It was enlightening. Then my alarm went off, blasting "Chandeliers Should Only Fall On Villains" by the delectable  urlLink Khantra . In a purely reflexive move I leaped out of my bed and grabbed my alarm clock/CD player. Then I threw it into a chair in the other room, and it turned off. Have I mentioned how awesome a song "Chandeliers Should Only Fall On Villains" by  urlLink Khantra  is? It's possibly the greatest alarm I could ever ask for.  Made myself some Applejacks and waffles for breakfast. A truly well-rounded meal, accompanied by a short film titled " urlLink The Girl In The Red Dress ". It was a lovely way to start the day.   Rode my bike to school, aware that my rear-brake was broken. One of the spring-arms for the brake pads is broken, so it is constantly rubbing against the tire. Not so hard that I can't ride, just hard enough to make me furiously inefficient. I felt at least 2 drops of rain.  Class was spent talking and editing. The "teaching assistant" Gabe brought in a copy of The New York Times Magazine which had this great  urlLink article  about comics in it. I had read half of it yesterday and finished it today in Mr. G.'s office. We talked about comics Goldy and I enjoyed, and I'm going to be bringing some in tomorrow to let Gabe borrow. In exchange, he's going to lend me one of his college psych textbooks, and maybe take me to his college (Bard) some day to sit in on their cool cool curriculum. I also told Gabe about the 24-hour comic I did, and he said I should bring it in. So I think tomorrow, I'm going to stop by Jeff's new place on the way to school, and pick it up.  When class was out, it was raining somewhat, so I thought my ride home would be dangerous and miserable, but my tires handled it, and it was actually really fun. I found myself grinning madly as I exploded through puddles and drank all the drops that hit my mouth. As I passed the post office, I realized Andy surely would have received her package by now, and guess what I found when I got home? A reply letter, so sweet of her.  As the early evening rolled around my dog kindly asked of me to feed and walk her, which I did. I wore a raincoat and shorts outside, with  no shoes . It was fun. I  really really  enjoy the rain.
