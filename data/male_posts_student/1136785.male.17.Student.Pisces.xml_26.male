Thus, the conflict we should have entered is now the one we should not have entered.    I said I would do it, so here it goes. Today is a day for:   Boring, Yet Important   Or Why Kerry is Shitfucked   Unless you're not not in the vincity of a television or without access to the internet (a truly strange circumstance for you to be reading this) you have probably heard that that Iraqi sovereignty has been  urlLink handed over  two days before the June 30th deadline. The current administration, notoriously fond of pre-emption, has tried to jump ahead of insurgents who would have used the well known date for "spectacular blood baths". Which is a reasonable assumption, seeing as violence has escalated to high levels in the past few days. Any attacks on the 30th now should be slightly less meaningful and symbolic. After signing the papers, US Proconsul Paul Bremer was on a C-130 flying out of Iraq in less than an hour.   Now when we say handed over, we of course mean restored up to a point. None of this is a huge suprise, as this goverment is merely yet another interim goverment to prepare for the final preparations of preparing to create a duly elected and stable Iraqi democracy. The number one priority, and the goal that will affect all other decisions, is of course attempts to create some semblance of stability in Iraq. There are some vague signs of increasing Iraqi frustration with the foreign meddling and murdering of the insurgents as well, so Allawi may have a base to launch hardy measures against them.   These are all basic, undetailed facts - hardly informative. One may ask, what the hell this has to do with Kerry at all. Iraq only has roughly 8,000 'troops' and 40,000 poorly trained National Guard. It's security forces are yet to be intergrated, and local tough men are seeking to carve out their own power bases. NATO has only agreed in theory to train Iraqi security forces, with no actual plans hammered out. This means, more than anything, Coalition forces must remain in Iraq. That much is also obvious. They even have a UN mandate for up into 2006. We cannot in good concience immediately withdrawl American Soldiers. By engaging in this conflict, we are committed to remain until the end. A sudden retreat would be even more damaging to Iraq; it would be seen as a sign of victory by the insurgents, lead to massive power struggle in a vacuum, quite possibly creating a humanitarian crisis of great proportions as the county divided among strictly drawn but hazy ethnic and religious lines. The most likely result would be the rise of regional strong men and Islamic fundementalists.  The Iran backed Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq could have a field day. Iran itself may even jump to prey on its now vulnerable nemisis. The US would lose not only its credibility, but would be seen as weak willed and cowardly, willing to let the world suffer in isolation, and to hole itself up far on the other side of the Atlantic. An already simmering anti-american mood sure to cause trouble for the US down the line would be able to turn into a blazing fire, as whatever rises above the ashes in Iraq would surely have little respect for the country that smashed everything and ran. The worst sufferers would be the Iraqi people; the death toll could well be catastrophic in the ensuring civil turmoil.  That is of course quite a doomsday scenario, but one that presets a point. American soldiers will have to continue fighting, and unfortunately, dieing to help forge a much more stable Iraq. It's our responsibility to the world, to the Iraqi people. Soldiers, sadly, die to protect civilians. It doesn't always have to be the case, but it is here. The Iraqis are everymuch civilians as American citizen, and to abandon Iraq would only aggravate the situation. It's seems clear, though who knows fifty years down the line, that this is a conflict we should not have fought, or at least fought in this style. But an inherent characteristic of a quagmire is it's ability to grasp and hold, and Iraq is doing just that. It cannot be ignored and pretended as if nothing ever happened. this has matured beyond thin ideals that this just a conflict about oil (especially as it was well known how much the Iraqi oil industry/capacity atrophied during the past decade and how hard it would be to restard before the war) and greed - it is a conflict that needs to be resolved, however painfully. To cut and run would be as selfish as any of those reasons for entering the war.  Once again, what the hell does this have to do with Kerry? Kerry and his advisors are far too intelligent to not realize the above. But with the election quickly becoming simply a referendum on Iraq, he is trapped. The non incumbent party typically has this problem, being deluded under conflicting views whose only similarites are in their anti-incumbency. Most of his 'supporter's' are not even voting for him; they are voting against Bush and what they see as his war. They know next to nothing about Kerry, and are sometimes openly hostile to him - to them, he's just the anti-bush button/chad on the ballot. Kerry has done little to help himself in this matter, so frequently refusing to come out solidly on issues or backtracking that even he probably doesn't know what he is for beyond winning the election. Kerry cannot possibly satisfy the demand that the troops be returned home. Bush doesn't have this problem. His campaign is quite comfortably acknowledging the further involvement of US troops, that things are getting better, and the UN involved. Kerry may say Bush is moving too late for what Kerry demanded, but that's hardly a forceful campaign. Claiming a pullout would likely gain him more recognition, cut away the gray area between him and Bush, and garner rabid support from the left. But what would happen when he could not follow up on the plan? Would he willingly sacrifice Iraq to it's fate for a campaign point? Not likely. So he is stuck with a position that a good portion of his (at least more vocal) supposed supporters cannot accept. The average american, while generally being more centrist than believed, would find it hard to support a man who could not come up with a firm, new idea on how to deal with the situation. Nixon promised a secret plan to win Vietnam that he couldn't reveal lest his rivals steal it and won, but he was going against McGovern - whom openly protested the war. The Bush administration already has a war winning plan, so they say, so that option is less appealing for Kerry to take.  But wait! Can't Kerry save himself on the other major issue of the election! Surely Kerry use the public's miasma about the economy to his advantage, whether or whether not that it appears to be growing again and that jobs are being created at 150,000-300,000 a month. The fact do not really matter in this case, because the public still feel that that the economy is in the shit tank. (Un)fortunately, it appears that Kerry has no idea how to campaign. As barren as the political wasteland is, here is what Kerry has come up with two weeks ago. A  urlLink seven dollar minimum wage . THE FUCKING SEVEN DOLLAR MINIMUM WAGE! What the hell is he doing? Other than being obviously nothing more than a 'proven' vote getter, it's sending him straight in the wrong direction. Kerry and his advisors seem to believe that Bush is the new Reagan even more than Bush does. Bush is not an anti goverment conservative. Bush (much like Reagan secretly was) is all about big government policies and spending initatives. He may as well be one of the most liberal presidents since Rooselvelt, economically speaking.   Kerry cannot hope to confront Bush on this front. Bush's first campaign ads focused on No Child Left Behind and the Medicare precscription drug bill - each of which will expand Washington, and cost taxpayers untold billions. Kerry has been pre-empted on the spending front. Where else is Kerry left to confront Bush? On taxes.  This is not some bullshit  urlLink middle class tax cuts  (ie; specialized tax credits for good behavior). He needs to come full out and against the entire tax code.  The Bush campaign would be reeling from such a suprise move. Either they would have to defend the absurdities inherent in the system, or create their own tax overhaul package.  Gone are the days of  urlLink 'me-too Kerry' . Bush would finally have to react to him, not the other way around. Suddenly, Kerry's not proposing thing the administration already appears to be doing. They would have to radically change their tactics to adapt to such a move. Kerry could even keep his union patronage in the process, by calling for a transparent tax code where savings are exempt from taxation with an end to corporate subsidies and welfare on both the paying and recieving sides. You save it, you keep it. There's a motto people would rally behind. Kerry could even attract support for the upper income bracket, by promising to end the  urlLink alternative minimum tax . Worse come to worse, realizing we're talking about a campaign here, he could tell a little white lie to his unions, promising to tax corporate profits ruthlessly, with the hidden secret being that corporations don't pay taxes, individuals do - at least according to some.   It's not as if Bush could contest the actual revenues brought in by such an overhaul. His deficits have made that an invalid point. Kerry just needs to cut those up to claim a victory. It's not the best overall strategy, but he hasn't given too many options. It's time for him to differentiate himself on the issues, and actually obtain a base attracted to him and his policies, not to his being not-bush - much to shaky and double edged of a platform, and a failure of the democratic system.   That was fun. Most of the points, links, and even word choices/sentences were stolen from Reason.com. Ain't I a stinker? I say that so I can in good faith post this other  urlLink link  showing why John F. Kerry needs to re-invent himself taxwise in the guise of JFK, and why JFK was actually a supply side economist.   I promise I'll put up an emo post later.
