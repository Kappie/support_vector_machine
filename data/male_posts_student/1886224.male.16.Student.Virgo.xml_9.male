I doubt that we'll buy anything though. Last night, the Yankee/Met game got rained out so they are going to play a double header on Sunday which is gonna be great! I hate the Mets and hope that the Yankees crush them like the little bugs that they are. Anyways, I hope to be back Sunday with stuff to write about.
