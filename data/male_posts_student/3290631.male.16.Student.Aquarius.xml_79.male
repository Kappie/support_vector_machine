I ran things over to the dry cleaners, moved a shitload of boxes of school supplies upstairs to the classrooms (Lots of heavy lifting and sweat--I was such a hunk today. haha), emptied bookcases into boxes and moved those boxes around, ran a package over to the post office, and delivered documents to some guy's apartment. It was tres hot in the building and when I got home, I was sooo tired.  I napped for a while too.  That's about it for now.
