So I decided to edit it a little bit and give me one more sidebar. I'm not experienced in manually coding sites so it took me a whole day to edit it. Tell me if there's any glitches on this new template.  By the way, drop by at  urlLink eNovel  for another update by me. This time I write the character of Achik, Angah's younger brother. Looks like I'm the only one who write two characters in  urlLink eNovel.
