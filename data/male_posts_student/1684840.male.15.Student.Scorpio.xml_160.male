For anyone who doesn't know what that is, well it's a day at school where we get to pay to wear our own clothes other than their stoopid uniform.  I stuck on my jeans and my "Byte Me" T-Shirt.  The day over all was pretty good.  I'm not going to go into it that much because It wasn't that entertaining.  A certain few people weren't in school today which made the day more enjoyable.  In most lessons we had fun because more than half of the lesson populations were in Belgium (land of chocolate  )  Might be going town tomorrow. Dad brought us a laptop and I've installed a few things on it and set up user accounts for me and my brothers.  It's wicked, thanks to Dad   I've formatted my computer and installed... Windows XP!  Finally I'm back where the cool blue graphics run wild and the smoothness can let rip.  I just made a nice background in Adobe Photoshop for it and It's ready to be piled up with programs!    Night
