Well, I took up commitments like Student Life Sub-Comm, which I'm pleased to serve in as it has been my area of interest for service. I've been staying in Music Ministry. Somehow, I've learnt alot being there and also at the same time, build relationships with fellow brothers and sisters in Christ. My greatest regret is my failure to fulfill my commitments at the SPG coordinatoor for the Lower Secondary, really hope I can do something about it this next half of the year.   Spiritually, I've gone thru many trials and testings. Though my faith is not exactly strong enough to move mountains, but I am glad that by God's grace, there's still some longing for Him. I've considered baptism. I'm thinking thru it now still. Once I settled all my commitments to God, as in what my relationship with Him means, I'll take the dip and "ceremonially" take up my cross.   I've been in love, everyone has I believed, probably even a 10 year old girl. But it all depends on how you define love. I do not know whether it's what you'll call true love, but I know that it means something to me. At least it thought me something. But memories stay. But I believe they'll be more of help than hindrance.   Academically, I've never been better. With my 16 points for Mid-year results, I guess my hard work has paid off. Nil Sine Labore.   There are many things I learnt in this first half of the year, things I hope will build me with good character and help me to live a life for God.
