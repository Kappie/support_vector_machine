I thought of paper, but alas paper is a medium which drawings are made not notes of this importance.  I continued upon my wandering thoughts until it came to me, I will but put them on the internet.  Then and there it was born the idea of using a blog, a wondrous idea to whom ever invented it, to store both my thoughts and ideas, and hopefully some good opinions as well.  I do not lavish my mind with the hopes of others reading these writings, I only hope that they are preserved in their entirety for so however long the internet shall live.  Iggy :)
