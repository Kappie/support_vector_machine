I think it started from before but it didnt erupt til today..Aperently Ben has been going through ppls bags 4no reason WITHOUT their consent...appearently Divyesh lost his tie and he saw Ben goin thru his bag..hes reporting it 2moro and I heard mine was gone through..though nothing missing im bringing it up..  Anyway back to it.  Zainul during art had gone to the toilet and guess what!he came back to class,he saw Ben goin through Haziqah(his girlfriend)`s bag..and he scolded Ben abt goin thru ppls bags and they started arguing...Ben seemed not to care..Zai was bloody pissed..  Then during break or at the end of it,Zai was shouting away at Ben who then started becoming a racist and started mocking Zai..I was the closest 2 Zainul pretty much..I was throwing away some trash I had and my head turned upwards and bam!Arguing man..I could see Zai`s veins popping out of his neck and he really wanted to punch ben which wasnt a good idea..Bens like fucking huge and zai is tall but thin u know..and b4 he did anything stupid i pulled Zainul away before he did something stupid and/or something he would regret...we got into a little shoving match..he pushed me away a bit but I pushed him back and he stormed off and disappeared..  Turns out he went to the office...2report this  Anyway during math Miss Tok came by and wanted 2 see Ben..*the moment kind of music*..then some form1 or 2guys came by 2get bens belongings which me and Alex Wung fixed up...anyway maths 2dya was easy...and hahaha Afandi wasnt here(absent)so class was generally much more peaceful..haha..Then saw zai writing something on a peice of paper outside class after math but every1 generally left him alone..  Then passing by the office..Ben at almost perfect timing 'has a migrain headache'..I wonder if its real..hardly anyone belives its real...bastard..His father was there..damn his dad`s alot smaller than him!  Then Zai returned in the middle of BM class crying kinda..dunno why..anyway he thanked me during lunch for restraining him..I felt like I had to do something..And I think ben could finally get expelled..every year got some problems like this..But fear a bit for Zainul..in school Ben can just be expelled but outside?You know what kinda person Ben is..  hahaha pity Farouq who could hardly breathe during chemistry cause Pn farah was at the back and scared because he`s together with her daughter..damn..haha..  hmm damn Jon Lee has a new phone..dman chun...ugh that tomboyish girl was being a big ass pest 2 Cheryl and also getting on my nerves as I was talkin 2her....next time happens..im gonna give her a tounge lashing..ppl these days..hahaha I crossed the street not to get 2my car but to 'get away from Cheryl'hahaha!  shit Thomas Cup on..big ass fight now!g2g see it!ciao!  Riz.
