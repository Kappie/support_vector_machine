Shut up or kill yourself if you can't handle your "plate."    I finished my research paper revision and I am confident that I will get a good grade on it. I man, I just forgot to revise another paper. I will do that tomorrow!    School's out next week. I want to get my registration date in the mail soon so I can register for fall. People are like, "I did that already when I registered for summer." So what! I hate doing that and I shouldn't have to!!!!!!!   I can't wait to clean up my room and get rid of a lot of paperwork trash I have been saving from school. I want to make room for an eisel so I can draw more easily. Also make more room for computers!!!!!!  Damn, I was thinking of going on a blind date thru a mutal friend but then I came to my senses! Why the heck would I want to go thru de-Robification for some stupid broad????? Focus baby! I on the prize....a degree.
