We were going to perform drumbone at the talent show, but they're fucking schedule idiots(as are most Unitarians), and scheduled it for 2-3 in the morning. Wtf?!   I would like to goto others- I met some cool people there. Thing is though, we only were able to get to know eachother for the first couple hours, then everybody decided to be whores and go hog the movie room. We did watch the Blue Man DVD, and that was teh sweet.  Turns out, that Chappelle's show has eliminated racism. How? At opening circle, I yelled out "I'm rick james, bitch!" and EVERYBODY else yelled out either "Charley Murphy!" in the rick james voice, or "Yeeee-yeeeahh!"  It has destroyed what it took so fondly to make fun of. Odd.  Anyway, I'm trying to make the decision of whether to rebuild the drumbone, or build a PVC instrument that can play Sing Along. They both would cost about the same, I think.  I was sick from school yesterday, due to uber allergy-ness. It was bad. Now I'm probably APV in 3 classes, but whatever.  :-O Jay Leno is having Blue Man Group perform tonight! I thought it was last night, but I was teh wrong! So watch it TOnight, or you'll get herpes!  Well, I guess it's time for school- gotta work on my website and let Welch bitch us out for not doing homework she didn't assign.  I also have some more comics on the way, they're already done, I just need to upload them- Hang tight!  As Nicholas says(I thought this was genius), later, bed bugs and stuff.
