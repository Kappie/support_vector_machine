Jus the whole atmosphere jus threw me off the whole day...well estancia went 1-2 for the tourney, so i guess we get to keep our no.2 seeding for C.I.F. Well, big game againts "the eric and corey show" on tuesday, im really looking forward to that cuz last year i could remember the madness at that gym...the crowd, the cheerleaderz (yes cheerleaderz...fuckerz), and the whole atmosphere at that place. And to beat them at their home gym...its gonna b a heavenly bliss to c them jus cry...cry!...jus cry!...haha. Can't wait for the playoffz...later.
