Time just flies when you happen to be doing mindless crap on the internet.  My mood right now is kinda at a state where I feel great, but will crash after I type this.  So I got this blog linked on Semisomnus, if you haven't been there... WWW.SEMISOMNUS.COM There ya go ^_^  4|\|1m3 F4c3!!! So here I am, with my trusty Alakai by my side, surfing the net from like 9pm-6am.  Here is what went down: -Voicechatted with Crimestopper #3981 for many hours -Browse Jlist.com, this place has kick ass stuff spent a good time there wishing I had a credit card        Hello Kitty "shoulder massager", anyone??? -Edit Spiku's gay flames on WWW.SEMISOMNUS.COM -Ramen and Waffles. -Had breakfast (see previous) -Wow, it seems like more happened last night, but y'know, I can't seem to remember.
