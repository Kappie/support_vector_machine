Scrutiny   Labor Unions receive a free pass from a Judge to continue violating campaign law, at least for another year (just in time for the 2004 election, how convenient).  The Judge that made this arbitrary rulling is Gladys Kessler.  Who is she?    Kessler, Gladys  Born 1938 in New York, NY  Federal Judicial Service: U. S. District Court for the District of Columbia Nominated by William J. Clinton on March 22, 1994, to a seat vacated by Michael J. Boudin; Confirmed by the Senate on June 15, 1994, and received commission on June 16, 1994.   Education: Cornell University, B.A., 1959  Harvard Law School, LL.B., 1962  Professional Career: Appellate attorney, National Labor Relations Board, 1962-1964 Legislative assistant, U.S. Sen. Harrison A. Williams, 1964-1966 Legislative assistant, U.S. Rep. Jonathan Bingham, 1966-1968 Special assistant, Director of Office of Staff Relations, New York City Board of Education, 1968-1969 Private practice, Washington, DC, 1969-1977 Associate judge, Superior Court of the District of Columbia, 1977-1994  Appointed by Clinton, and worked for both Harrison Williams and Jonathan Bingham.  Senator Williams was forced to resign from the Senate in 1982 after being found guilty of taking bribes in the Abscam scandal.  He was a hardcore democrat.  Representative Bingham was also a democrat but appeared to have a cleaner past.  The Private Practice mentioned above was a 'public interest' law firm.  I have links for all of this if you are really interested.  Point is, she's using her position on the bench to advance her personal causes, which is exactly what we can't have judges doing.  The importance of an impartial judiciary is fundamental to the republic.  Sure, it happens on both sides, but this is a particularly terrible example.
