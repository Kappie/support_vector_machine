It was watching "Manichan" with Diablo Dos.  This really kinda' weird dude has us at his house for the couple days we were in New York.  We watched some Christian Music Videos, lol, Really, and then we watched this really disturbing OLD OLD movie about a guy who falls in love with a manichan!  Kinda' retarded and all, but I will never forget that movie!  There was this one guy named "HOLLYWOOD!" he was pretty feminine, and snapped his fingers alot, he kinda' reminded me of... well you fill in the blanks!  Later Players! The Bongos will BonGO all night long.... Keep it real, I'm Will
