Fuck you, you think you're so good at life and shit and everything. Why do people have to have lives with nothing wrong in them. Or is it just me thinking my life is so bad. I know it's not, but why does this one peron hafta have everything seriously. He has a girlfriend, money, soccer, grades, friends, stuff to do...all the time. And then he goes and acts like an asshole when he comes over here. Fuck that shit.Fuck you, sorry to be an imperfection on your perfect little life. Will someone tell me why I even care lol. I need to find something/someone new, im getting sick of the sameness of my life.
