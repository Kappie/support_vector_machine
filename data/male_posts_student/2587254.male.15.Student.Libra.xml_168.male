Actually it's kinda funny how I'm done all my exams before half the people I know have even started. In fact, Jenn's the only person that I can think of that finished exams before me. HEEHEE DONE! So today after going to the math exam *which I think was easy* I bid some people good summers, and then went on my merry way to...  Head 2 Head games.  Yup again lol. I think I've been there too much last 3 days...which is why I'm gonna stop for a while haha. Today though me and John headed there and played some Empire Earth, which took up most of the time. We started off though with some Quake III, where I got owned, well except by the bots I actualy came in 3rd outta six which isn't bad, seeing I've played the game only 'bout 10 times in my life. EE took up most of the time *over 2 hours* and in the end...WE MANAGED TO KILL ONE COMP! Yeah sad I know lol. After that played some BF, and then had to go home.  So here I am now...home...  Today and tomorrow I'm gonna be a hermit in my house, as I have to get my jazz audition piece up and ready by Friday morning. So back to tromboning haha...  Oh yeah...and after listening to the Chicago copy of "Caravan," yeah Chicago is now on "my favourite non eurodance people" chart. They're actually AWESOME. If you ever find it, listen to Caravan by Chicago...it is actually AWESOME.  Anyways as said before, back to tromboning...and adding Maisie's link onto my blog.  Later. FREEDOM AT LAST!
