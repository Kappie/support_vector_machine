I'm going to see my ex to go get my webcam back. Hopefully I can hang out with him today. I also want to get a McFlurry. School was crazy today. So much negative energy and backlash. I can't stand to be there anymore. I think it's the reason why I go see my ex. He's the only sane person in my social life.   It's 8:27 P.M on my digital clock. I went to see my ex. He look real good all dressed up and shiet. We just hung out at McDonalds. It was coo. I did find out he was going to R.I for real to go to school. I was happy for him, but inside I was like: "Man, I'm gonna miss him like shiet." I mean its 3 hours drive, but the fact that he's not in the city anymore is a fucken reality check. He's gonna be livin it up, up there. I'm not going to say don't go because that would be selfish of me. I mean you know experiencing the whole college thing. We still young, but I just want to make memmories with him. I have a few with him, but you know I don't know how long memmories will last me. Hey, i got a phone, he's got a phone, so we should be good. Long as he don't lose contact, I might not get that part taht I want back or I may wait for a long time, but hey I'm hoping for good friends. I'll tell him the truth one of these days.   Here's the log song, Avril Lavigne -  Fall to Pieces  It's self explanatory. But hey I don't know.   "I looked away Then I look back at you You try to say The things that you can't undo If I had my way I'd never get over you Today's the day I pray that we make it through  Make it through the fall Make it through it all  And I don't wanna fall to pieces I just want to sit and stare at you I don't want to talk about it And I don't want a conversation I just want to cry in front of you I don't want to talk about it Cuz I'm in Love With you  You're the only one, I'd be with till the end When I come undone You bring me back again Back under the stars Back into your arms  And I don't wanna fall to pieces I just want to sit and stare at you I don't want to talk about it And I don't want a conversation I just want to cry in front of you I don't want to talk about it Cuz I'm in Love With you  Wanna know who you are Wanna know where to start I wanna know what this means  Wanna know how you feel Wanna know what is real I wanna know everything, everything  And I don't wanna fall to pieces I just want to sit and stare at you I don't want to talk about it And I don't want a conversation I just want to cry in front of you I don't want to talk about it  And I don't wanna fall to pieces I just want to sit and stare at you I don't want to talk about it And I don't want a conversation I just want to cry in front of you I don't want to talk about it Cuz I'm in Love With you  I'm in love with you Cuz i'm in love with you I'm in love with you I'm in love with you"   *EverYthinG AbouT HiM wAs LiKE WoaH!*
