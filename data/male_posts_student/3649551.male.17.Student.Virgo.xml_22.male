I always give it a chance to justify why it was necessary to include any unpleasant stuff. Swearing, violence, nudity, drugs ... if it serves a purpose and contributes to a theme, I'll sit through it. A lot of people disagree with me on this. A lot of Christians probably think I'm going to hell for some of the movies I've watched. A lot of these same Christians tell me to read my Bible and to 'know what kind of devices the Enemy has' to pull me down into sin. Well guess what? Literature or movies that deal with the darker side of human nature are damn fine training for learning what kind of evil exists in the world. In  The Art of War  by Sun Tzu, it talks about how you will sometimes win battles if you know yourself but not your enemy. If you know both yourself and your enemy, you will always win. If I know nothing about evil, how can I overcome it? How can I see it for what it is and combat it with righteousness? If I don't know what nightmares people have to go through, if I've never been introduced to anything like their suffering, even if it's from a movie, then how can I possibly talk to them about suffering? What right do I have to talk about how Christ can fix problems when I don't even know what the problems are? I don't think naive Christians are going to do any good. Even if my knowledge about certain evil things comes from a movie, it's better than nothing. At least I've been introduced to the concept and I've had time to think about it and form opinions. Then, when I come across someone who was molested as a child, I have some inkling of how it might have messed them up. I can at least  guess  at how painful that evil must have been. Feeling discomfort while watching a movie is not a reason to walk out. It's a reason to sit it out and think about it later. Why did it make you uncomfortable? Now, put yourself in the shoes of someone who has gone through something like what you were watching. Imagine how they would feel. And then imagine how you felt too high and mighty to watch a fictional representation of their actual hell. We're all little Pharisees. We're too afraid to burst the protective Christian bubble we've wrapped around ourselves to get out there and tackle this stuff head on. We'd rather sit back and condemn the people who try to bring it to our attention. We'd rather not think about it at all. Well sometimes this stuff needs to be considered. We need tosift through the shit  that people go through so that we can be there for them. We need to understand some of this so that we can better love people. And if I write that and don't change my behavior, I'm a hypocrite. Therefore, action is called for. Action beyond my fingers hitting keys. I'll report in later. This is interesting because as I've been wrapping this up I've been hearing from Krispin the Poet about a lot of the same stuff. He and I think similarly in a lot of ways but often take slightly different perspectives on things. We've just started planning some plans. I think that, together with the people in my youth group, we need to take things into our own hands and start changing things. Once again, I'll post on some of this later.
