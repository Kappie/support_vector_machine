this 
guy. saying that it has got to do with family background, that Gin will 
have 
to suffer for the rest of her life if she were to be with him.

Due to family's pressure, the couple quarrel very often. Tho Gin love 
the 
guy deeply, but she always ask him: "How deep is your love for me?" As 
the 
guy is not good with his words, this often caused Gin to be very upset. 
With 
that  the family's pressure, Gin often vented her anger on him. As for 
him,.... he only endure it in silence.

After a couple of years, the guy finally graduated and decided to 
further 
his studies in overseas. Before leaving, he proposed to Gin: "I'm not 
very 
good with words. But all I know is that I love you. If you allow me, I 
will 
take care of you for the rest of my life. As for your family, I'll try 
my 
best to talk them round. Will you marry me?" she agreed,  with the 
guy's 
determination, the family finally gave in and agreed to let them get 
married. So before he left, they got engaged.

Gin went out to the working society, whereas the guy was overseas, 
continuing his studies. They sent their love thru emails  phone calls. 
tho 
it's hard, but both never thot of giving up. One day, Gin was on her 
way to 
work, she was knocked down by a car that lost control. When she woke 
up, she 
saw her parents beside her bed. She realised that she was badly 
injured. 
Seeing her mum crying, she wanted to comfort her. But she realized that 
all 
that could come out of her mouth was just a sigh. she' had lost her 
voice....

The doctors said that the impact on her brain has caused her to loss 
her 
voice. Listening to her parents' comfort, but with nothing coming out 
from 
her, she broke down. During the stay in hospital, besides
silent cry,.. it's still just silent cry that accompanied her.

Upon reaching home, everything seems to be the same. Except for the 
ringing 
tone of the phone. Which pierced into her heart everytime it rang.She 
does 
not wish to let the guy know  not wanting to be a burden to him, she 
wrote 
a letter to him saying that she does not wish to wait any longer.

With that, she sent the ring back to him. In return, the guy sent 
millions  
millions of reply, countless of phone alls,.. all that Gin could do, 
besides 
crying, is still crying.... The parents decided to move away, hoping 
that 
she could eventually forget everything  be happy. With a new 
environment, 
Gin learnt sign language  started a new life.

Telling herself everyday that she must forget the guy. One day, her 
fren 
came  told her that he's back. She asked her fren not to let him know 
what 
happened to her. Since then, there wasn't anymore news of him. A year 
has 
passed  her fren came with an envelope, containing a invitation card 
for 
the guy's wedding.

Gin was shattered. When she open the letter, she saw her name in it 
instead. 
When she was about to ask her fren wat's going on, she saw the guy 
standing 
in front of her.

He used sign language telling her, "I've spent a year's time to learn 
sign 
language. Just to let you know that I've not forgotten our promise. Let 
me 
have the chance to be your voice. I Love You." With that, he slipped 
the 
ring back into her finger. Gin finally smiled.

**Treat every moment as is it's the last day, then you'll know how to 
treasure*
