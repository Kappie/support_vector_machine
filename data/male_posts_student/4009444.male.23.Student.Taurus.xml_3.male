In other news:  Love: Coming home Coming home to a cat that is really excited to see you Coming home to a cat that is really excited to see you and wants nothing more than to play, despite the fact the she is too lazy to walk more than a few steps.  Hate: Petco closing at 9, the shelter closing at 7. Sitting next to atrociously fat women on planes. The fat women masking their fat odor with fat lady perfume.  Nasty.  "Barney's movie is pretty good, but 'Football in the Groin' has a football in the groin..."
