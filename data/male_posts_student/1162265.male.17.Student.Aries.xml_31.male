It doesn't really matter though, sure I don't like it, but I can easily deal with it.  It's not the end of the world or anything, and I still get thursday late, so its all good.  I guess this has been further alleviated by the fact that I got my Nag Hammadi Library and "The Gnostic Gospels"!  I am so happy, I started reading the Gnostic Gospels, it is so good and informative.  I love Elaine Pagels, I wonder if she actually is Gnostic or is just a good speaker on the Gnostic theories.    Protest was today.  It seemed like a bad idea, and I didn't participate.  I'm glad I didn't, firstly it's purpose was weakend by people using it as an excuse to cut school. Secondly, it was preaching to the choir.  People can talk about their voices being heard, but just because your voices aren't emancipated, they are still saying the same things.  We already know that prejudices of our parents have rubbed off onto us.  So few people actually support the war in the area, that protesting is silly.  Who protest what others around m alra see?  Come to think of it, yeah, your voice wouldn't be heard because it sounds the same as everyone elses.
