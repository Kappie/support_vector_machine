I'll bring it to a capella rehearsal on Tuesday and see what they think.  I know I haven't written anything substantial or funny in the last couple of days -- just not much to say I guess.  But I promise, tomorrow will be a banner day here on the weblog.  I'm talking pages of gut-busting hilarity.  I promise.  Or I will delete this post.  :)
