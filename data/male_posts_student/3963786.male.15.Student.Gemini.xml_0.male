I'd like to say I'm going to make sure to do it for the next few days, but I'm going to help roof. See my great grandparents roof has like 6 leaks in it, and they've gotten to the age where they can't really work on their house as.......easily as they might have recently been able to. So me, my dad, my uncle, my grandpa, and my cousin are all going. And that means no entries all weekend. (They're one or two lightbulbs away from being able to join the ranks of even the best omish farmers.) Sorry!
