When i get it im gonna install gentoo as ive said be4 but slackware 10 just came out and it seems pretty nifty. ill decide later. I think im gonna goto hobby lobby today and get some model paints; i have a truck i wanna finish. its a good hobby and kills time like you wouldnt believe. Its great fun to do. I highly reccomend it too. also, i found the best wallpaper site for hotties in the world. it literally has thousands of wallpapers with girls ranging from carmen electra to nikki nova, the porn star. its  urlLink www.skins.be  . i highly reccomend it.    out.
