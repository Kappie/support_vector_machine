Soud mixing is your computers ability (with the help of soundcard and drivers) to play one sound over top of another.  For example, take using msn messenger and winamp together.  You get your music, and you get the messenger prompts.  Simple, right?    Well, as you know, i just got my Gentoo Linux box running, and thats the 'issue of the day' for me today.  You also know that i upgraded from kernel 2.4.26 to 2.6.7 just to get the ALSA sound drivers.    Well, today, i was using GAIM (messenger) and i was playing some music on XMMS (like winamp).  Well, when XMMS was playing, you couldn't hear the GAIM sounds.  When XMMS stopped, all the sounds that i missed in GAIM played all at once, and i couldn't start a new song on XMMS.  This frusterated me, and i consulted whom i like to think of as the 'Gentoo Guru' for me.  He was the one to start on the topic of sound mixing.    Well, to set it up was quite simple, just a simple script, and it was up and running, and i was happy ^_^.  Now i can play XMMS and hear the GAIM sounds at the same time.  Great, eh?    On the note of my kernel upgrades, i'm actually happy that i did upgrade, because when i booted kernel 2.4.26, i was getting all these messages that some modules weren't loading.  Although it didn't seem to affect performance at all, now with the new kernel, i don't get these messages.    Next step on linux configuration: idesk, and getting openoffice!    Lates
