Im going to recap what may have well been the worst week of my life (with the little trademark sign). im just going to run down the list of things that happened to me that made the beginning of the week horrendous and the week end much less so.  Saturday: That false sense of security from that damn fortune cookie.   Sunday: Continued with that false sense of security and confidence that the week was going to be a good one.  Monday: Expected, but none the less demoralizing, rejection. Being told that I was not going to be invited back to Jazz Band next year.  Tuesday: Finding out I might move to Iowa (It's a long story, if youd like to know, ask me online because I dont feel like talking about it in person.)  Wensday: Sitting in self-loathing. Studying my butt off for the stupid AP History test I would take on Friday.  Thursday: Failed my driving exam. (Now, this is where the week began to pick up.) Talked to Brittany for an extended period of time online. She sent me an online survey thingy that posted this question: "Of all your friends, if you could date someone who would it be?" To which I replied: "I would ask Brittany to prom." So now were going as friends and I am considrably more freakin happy then I was the rest of the week. =)  Friday: Took my AP History test. Have you ever studied for something to such a point that you think you know it. Your not sure you know it, but you think you do, so your expecting the test to knock you on your back when you take it? That was the feeling going into this thing. And the multiple choice questions surely reinforced this point. But the essay questions were preety easy (in my humble, messed up opinion) and im fairly confident about the test overall. Following that three hour peice of joy I had no intention of going to my Geometrey class, so I just went to the media tech room and slept through the rest of the school day. After school Brittany and I went to my house and hung around in my horrendously dirty living room, watching  Varsity Blues . Good times. =) *As an aside note, if youve never seen  Varsity Blues  go out and watch it. Its worth every moment just to see the controlling dad get hit in the nose and the mascots getting hit in the nuts by a mighty powerful football.* Went to the Rednecks house afterwards and hung out. Helped him work on Bugzilla a little bit, then came home and watched  Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom .   Saturday: I woke up and found myself scrambling to get ready for one of my friends Eagle Scout Court of Honor. I have known Todd Hopper since I was in the fourth grade, if not before hand. He has proven to be the most loyal, trustworthy, loveable guy I have ever known. I never felt prouder to be a Boy Scout when I saw Todd up on the stage at his church and his mother was there crying over how far he has come. Almost every concience memory I have about scouting is some way related to Todd Hopper, and I am a much better person for having known him. After the ceremony finished Todd, myself and a group of friends went back to his house to play around on the computers, but that feel through due to complicated bumbling on Richards part. We ended up going to Blockbuster and renting  Reservoir Dogs . Not the greatest peice in the Quentin Tarantino library, and the acting is sub-par in some places, but I think the performance over all is better then Todd would like to have admitted.   This all being said and done, its a new week and things are looking up. I have  Reservoir Dogs  until next Saturday. I can go and take my driving exam over again in two weeks. I have about 4 months worth of Anime that I borrowed from Josh Rooney to keep me busy and, to top it all of with a marachino cherry I have a date for Prom with a beutiful and funny girl. Thinks are relativly good, and if I dont have to end up moving to hell come the end of the summer, they'll be even better.
