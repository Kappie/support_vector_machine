According to this USA Today  urlLink article :  Starting next month, children in grades 4 though 8 and employers nationwide will be asked to help get families and companies better prepared to respond to a crisis. Let the fun begin. Soon Johnny will be informing on Mommy and Daddy when they don't follow the National Plan. Just as children learned to bug their parents to quit smoking and wear seat belts, Homeland Security officials hope grade-school kids will prompt moms and dads to put together emergency plans. And to hold still while the nice officer scans your implanted ID chip. All the more reason to home school your kids, in my opinion. Oops... here come the helicopters again. Where’s my tinfoil hat?  Goose steppin’ to the oldies!
