I'll also write the stuff that's been happening over the past couple days, so just be patient. Oh, and I haven't forgotten about guess the song. I've been practicing this one song for a while now, but I keep messing up at this one part, so just lemme get it right and I'll have it up. Thanks for waiting, guys.  That is all. -- Feanor
