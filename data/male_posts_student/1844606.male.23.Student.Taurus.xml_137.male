If the past 3 and a half years were like this, I'd have a had a 4 year (albiet very expensive) vacation.  The question now is what to do with my time.    So far I've just caught up on school stuff and settling back in.  And I'm sure in a few weeks it will be devoted to studying comics and shit.  I've also realized part of the reason I like home more is that I'm not alone for over half of the day (though if I were there I would complain that I'm never alone).  Now there's lots of time.  Suppose I'll work on a resume and finding a job.
