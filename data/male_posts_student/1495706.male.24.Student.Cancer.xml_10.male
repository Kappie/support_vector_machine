First off, the name of the group is "Vanilla Ninja."  Which, seriously, is the most kick-ass name for a group I've heard of in a long, long time.    Secondly, they play instruments.  Guitars, drums- and they do it well.  Third, they sound like they're straight out the 1980s.  Sort of like The Go Gos, sort of like The Bangles, but sort of not.  It's awesome.    Ok, so there are a couple lame songs on the album but that's to be expected as all albums have at least one crappy track.  But mostly they're fun and good.  One could say they're good fun.    Vanilla Ninja- try it out!
