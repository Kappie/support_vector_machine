On the "excessive" Reagan coverage, Rather said “life goes on”, “There is other news, like the reality of Iraq”. Then added, “Once the herd starts moving in one direction, it's very hard to turn it, even slightly”. How true, doesn’t that remind you of the Abu Ghraib abuse coverage or the media hovering like savages over the “Daily Death Toll” in Iraq? Dan, if only you had the credibility, maybe we’d believe you. Dan, when's the last time CBS looked to find out what was  really  going on in the rebuilding of Iraq's infastructure? Instead you like to over-cover the 9/11 commission, and then only to put who on TICK TICK TICK 60 minutes? Clarke? To promote his book? The next Friday, Newsweek and Time magazine had front covers asking, How will the 9/11 commission effect the elections? Ha ha, wasn't that a little overcovered. You deserved the backlash CBS.  You can just feel all these media elites cringing every day this week. I can see Rather saying to his producer, give me some Abu Ghraib pictures d@mNit! No more reading Reagan accomplishments! Arrr....can we just slip something about Reagan being stupid or rasist in the script somewhere? If there aren't any naked pictures or dogs on leashes, then we'll ask our European friends for some fake photos right? At least Peter Jennings didn't go overboard like Rather.  Hypocricy, at its best...
