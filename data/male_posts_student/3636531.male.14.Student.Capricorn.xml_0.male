I can't really go biking because I don't know anyone who can do something with me right now.   Earlier today I thought of some pretty cool ideas for a new website/my website. They are both in planning stages. I will change my current website (fusionx2.com), because right now its failing....dismally. I don't think I can make a gfx design community, since there are way too many out there anyways. I was thinking of making a new version, more of a html site for quicker loading. It will have articles, games, fun stuff, and images. More like a personal site again. I'm also making it have to do with fantasy football.  That brings me to my next site idea. I was thinking of making a New England Fantasy football Network. I've been playing fantasy football for about 3 years, and I know a lot about it. I'm pretty obsessed with it, and my family already has a league, thanks to me and my dad (its called the South Shore Retards). The SSR has been around for 2 years now, with the coming season being its second season. I was thinking about getting some people to help me out with the site, giving up-to-date news, player predictions, and sponsoring leagues and publishing stats. Also it would have a forum and everything. This is a little far-fetched, but it might work...I just need some help with it.  Music: I recently found two new favorite bands for me: Anti-Flag and Rise Against. They are both punk bands, and I have a lot of there songs now. If you haven't heard them, than try to, you won't regret it.   Chris    Currently Listening To:  Anti-Flag- Turncoat  Mood:  bored out of my mind
