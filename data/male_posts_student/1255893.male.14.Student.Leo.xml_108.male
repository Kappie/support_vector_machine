You're mostly a bubbly, fun - innocent person. Described as cute possibly. However, you're a little naive about things and tend to be a little too trustworthy. As the first season, It Makes you the youngest - and so most immature - but people are inclined to look out for and protect you.  Well done... You're the most fun of the seasons :)    urlLink   ??
