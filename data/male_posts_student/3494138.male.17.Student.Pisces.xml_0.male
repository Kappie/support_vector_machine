I watched School of Rock just for shits and giggles.  Gave me something to do to pass the time.  I love that movie.  Wish I could play the guitar like Zach.  Actually, I wish I could play the guitar period.  Hehehe......oh well.  I'll stick to the drums for now.  I wanna learn some more complex stuff, but I really just need my own set to experiment with.  Kinda big investment, tho.  Don't know if I'm ready for that.  Maybe someday down the road.....anyways, I always gain a better appreciation for rock and roll after watching that movie.  Led Zep, Pink Floyd, The Who, The Doors, Deep Purple, all great stuff.  Coolest part of the movie is when he first teaches them to play.  I love when the keyboard guy learns Touch Me by The Doors.  Great song.  Hmmmmmmm......maybe The Doors will help me get to sleep........I'll try it.  peace
