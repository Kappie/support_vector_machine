Still have to discuss Temporal Difference decay, TD- Gammon, write 3 programs of tic-tac-toe using DP, MC and TD(0), a write up on my findings of these methods. That should be everything, probably talk to my advisor and re-edit the paper as needed and change wording if I don't like it. I also probably need to find out how the layout of the bibliogrpahy and citing will need to be done.
