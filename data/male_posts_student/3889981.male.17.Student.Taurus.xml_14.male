As I was saying my head is beginning to pound more nowadays, what with the increased investment in food and the frequency of looking at others' examination results. Only recently I had a headache so bad I can't seem to remember anything that happened on that day.  That was Friday.  The headache seemed to coincide with a terrible day.  All I remember about yesterday was that I broke my test-tube immediately after purchase. Fantastic. Oh yes, and I remember the quote of the day upon telling them of my plight - "So fast?"  They say speed is a virtue, after all. Why you looking at me like that?  Lately I've been more contradicting than usual - yes, the problems that come with immaturity, and I say IM with small I and M. I can't seem to fully concentrate on what I want to do. The worst thing is, sometimes I don't know what I am saying or doing.  The feeling is something like sitting down for the General Paper and thinking of all the points for a Chinese composition.  And I was only rubbishing the idea of open diaries just today. Well, my opinions change rapidly.
