And so what, if you don't like me I don't give a fuck If you don't like me I could change my luck It seems I'm gettin rotten to the core  Forget about tomorrow You and me, we're going down in sorrow The youth of the nation, going nowhere Station to station, Teenage Alien Nation The Teenage Alien Nation yeah  It's all wrong I guess the summer must have come and gone I guess we kinda shoulda known it all along We're never going anywhere  And sometimes, you've gotta pick it up And roll the dice, no lookin' back And man you don't think twice about Feeling lonely every day   Yea, hope you like that. It's a really good song. Anyway I haven't posted in a long time. I been working on the comic, so you know... been lazy. Anyway besides that, I have had to consider what college I want to go to. Now they tell me that your average actually matters and that if you don't go to college you'll end up as some worthless bum-shield for some rapist cop. The new comic will be up tomorrow, nothing special, still experimenting with my style. Till later. P.S. I'll try to post once every day or something.
