Finals suck... noone normal studies ahead (we all know my middle name is procrastination) and then we have to cram like 10 subjects at once.. not cool ..and the week before..which is the eighth week, teachers think everything is done and we learn nothing (not that i am complaining about that part....) but during the eighth week ... WHAT IS THE POINT OF COMING TO SCHOOL!!! i mean i'm sitting in a hell hole all day while i look outside and see birds chirping and people going on walks and ill can think about is what great sleep/tv/lazyness/NOT SCHOOL i am missing.... HMPF! but there is a light at the end of the tunnel and that my friends is SUMMERTIME ..... in the everlasting words of Brad Nowell "summertime, the living is easy..." get ready to sit back, relax, and do jack shit.... that is the only reason i have some level of sanity right now... summer... the only thing to look forward to .... everything to look forward to... (it would help if i had a license and a car for summer too... but i am presently working on that.... i have to renew my temps... finish class... test... get a car and insurance... it could be a while... but i have time.. i guess ive waited this long... i can wait a little longer ....) anyways... gots to study for the last non-final test of the year... poetry.... wow....studying takes whatever meaning there was out of a poem in the first place.. kind of like a good book... if you have to read it for school... the enjoyment gets sucked right out... and with that... i am out also... stay well everyone....
