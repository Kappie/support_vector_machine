(well, little do you all know that john kerry's decisiveness(tm) just dropped two weeks ago, and i already copped myself some. it's selling like hotcakes on the ebay underground, you know how we do. and hey, i'm feeling kinda presidenti -- oh, whew, it passed. must have been that time of the month. word.)  but anyway, here's an excerpt of his speech that i think every teenager, prospective voter, european, arab, muslim, and peta official should read:   we are connected as one people. if there's a child on the south side of chicago who can't read, that matters to me, even if it's not my child. if there's a senior citizen somewhere who can't pay for her prescription and has to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer, even if it's not my grandmother. if there's an arab-american family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process, that threatens my civil liberties. it's that fundamental belief -- i am my brother's keeper, i am my sister's keeper -- that makes this country work. it's what allows us to pursue our individual dreams, yet still come together as a single american family. "e pluribus unum." out of many, one.   yet even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. well, i say to them tonight, there's not a liberal america and a conservative america -- there's the united states of america. there's not a black america and white america and latino america and asian america -- there's the united states of america.   the pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into red states and blue states; red states for republicans, blue states for democrats. but i've got news for them, too. we worship an awesome god in the blue states, and we don't like federal agents poking around our libraries in the red states. we coach little league in the blue states and have gay friends in the red states. there are patriots who opposed the war in iraq and patriots who supported it. we are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the united states of america.
