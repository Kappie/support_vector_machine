Well anyway I gotta starty studying for exams. Im actually kinda worried. I hate exams they manage to put me in a 'glum' mood which means i sleep more often do less than normal. I have come to the realization all Im doing this for is to avoid studying. I HATE EXAMS.. ok enuf.. now.. to other topics.. Who knows 3DS MAX.. I wanna learn, I like experimenting.. but as much as I like it .. it takes a hell of a long time. So save me some time and help me out. I gotta get out a lot more in the summer
