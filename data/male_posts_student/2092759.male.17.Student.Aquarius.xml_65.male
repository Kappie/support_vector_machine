Alfred Molina plays Doc Ock very well, and brings out a human quality in the character that I feared would be absent from the film. Tobey Maguire and Kirstin Dunst, while still not the ideal choices, are becoming increasingly comfortable with their roles. It sets up the third movie quite nicely, although I completely hated the way the thing ended. It was just so... Anticlimactic.    Im sorry. I didnt mean to pry. I hope you dont stay mad at me.
