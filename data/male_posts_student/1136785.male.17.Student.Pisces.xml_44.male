Don't really know where to begin, but I will say I completely and utterly broke down Saturday night/Sunday Morning. I haven't cried for a looong time (well since the election actually, but I was/am a littlegirl about that, and notsincea looooong time before that), let alone like that. It's all really hard to explain.To begin, like all contrived stories, it revolves around a girl. This is the new girl I was posting about. I let my cock get the better of me again, and started things up with her, even if somewhat less...hormonal.    It's not as if the option was't there; in fact, it was more present then ever. In all my wildest fantasies, I couldn't ever imagine realistically I would be presented with what amounted to a willing sex slave, or even make the jump far enough that I would turn it down. I knowa distinct part of me won't likely forgive that. But damnit, it wasn't right.    Taking advantage of some emotionally broken girl who goes from relationship to relationshipseeking meaning and wholeness in a viscious cycle that only leaves her more sad and empty is wrong. Rationalizing she will be unhappy either way after three weeks, so make these three weeks great for her, and get some action in the process is just that - rationalizing. She wanted it so bad she even pulled that one on me. At least this way I canhelp a girl onto the path of self respect and happiness; I know it's hardly assured but this way is much more likely than any other. And don't try any bullshit about me being afraid of a relationship, so I ran. How  classic ! If I played along, I was essentially offered free sex for three weeks, after which I could go home and not care about it any more. That's not a fucking relationship. That's also why I couldn't go through with it, and let her use me as a crutch to sink lower and lower.    I was finally completely confused, and broken up over what to do. I spent a good few hours on the phone with a close friend whom I'm beginning to realize how much I miss (platonically damnit, don't read into things when you have plenty of other options) to try and figure out. Me an emotional matyr? When did this happen! But unfortunately, I had to realize the only healthy solution. No more. Not even cuddling, or holding, or anything like that. If my every touch is sexy and a turn on, then there can be none of it.    I hate seeing girls cry. It's not right. The talk, which occured roughly twelve hours ago, was rough. She knew it was coming, and even wrote a story about it for her fiction writing class - funny thing is, since she was starting to worry that I would abandon her, I guessed thats what she was writing. When you wear your heart on your sleeve, you run the risk of being an open book. But Jesus, no one should have to suffer that, and I don't mean me but her. She agreed with me the entire time, which is one reason she knew it was coming, and also reluctantly admitted all of her excuses and rationalizations were just that. You can't always have what you want the most; I should know that. She actually broke up with her ninth(?) boyfriend ( she hasn't been single for a long period since she was thirteen) before all this, so she's 'alone' but with friends as I point out. She's so terrifed of being alone, she just can't handle it. She has to literally sleep with other people just to be comfortable enough to make it through the night. The only good thing about all this is maybe she'll use it as spring board to something better. I don't know, as that's awfully conceited of me. It ended amicably enough, and she very reluctantly agreed that she, and thus our little group of friends which she needs more than me, shouldn't see me for at least a week, if not for the next three.    Of course this means after I came back from class, talking to some class mates about how one of my teachers was apparently  urlLink arrested  backin 2001 for 9/11, and gave a  urlLink testimony  in front of the senate Judiciary Comittee, who is also somewhat misogynistic and very passive aggressive - but this is a different story - she saw me, pulled me aside, and told me crying that one of the guys from our, my supposedly former, four/three people group won't talk to her anymore for driving me away. So now I have to find a way to deal with that. And do a powerpoint about Baghdad in Arabic by tomorrow. Shit me in a shit stick. It's never easy around here.   That's it for now
