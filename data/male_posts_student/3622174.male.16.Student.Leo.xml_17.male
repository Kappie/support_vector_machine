It's a web cartoon site, and it's got some of the best web cartoons in this world.  It's been highly praised since it opened a few years ago, and now, its even better than before.       Home Star Runner follows the life of Home Star...a little white thing...haven't quite figured out what he is.  It also follows his friends, including his girlfriend, Marzipan, and other characters, such as Strong Bad, Strong Mad, Strong Sad, The Cheat, and more.  They have all sorts of toons, including big cartoons, shorts, holiday cartoons, and the best, Strong Bad emails.  Every week, the creators of Home Star Runner will post a new cartoon, and most of the time, it will be a Strong Bad Email.  Strong Bad goes to his Compy 386 and checks his email, and always ends up telling a story about his life.  They're hilarious, and a lot of people go to the site just to see them.  Here's a couple screenshots from the new "Theme Park" episode of Strong Bad Email:        Some of the bigger cartoons have menus that will remind you of a DVD, and you can watch all sorts of special features that go along with the film.    There are all sorts of games to play, all sorts of activities, and it is definitely a great website.  I give Home Star Runner the elite score of  5 out of 5.
