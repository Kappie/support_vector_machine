I subscribe to the print version, look at the pretty pictures and then read the thing online.) It seems that scientists have discovered that if they block dopamine receptors in the brains of rhesus monkeys the monkeys turn into mad office workers. No kidding. For their study, Richmond and colleagues used seven rhesus monkeys. They had to push a lever in response to visual cues on a projection screen, and got a drop of water as a reward.  "They work more efficiently -- make fewer errors -- as they get closer to being rewarded. But without the dopamine receptor, they consistently stayed on-task and made few errors, because they could no longer learn to use visual cues to predict how their work was going to get them a reward." The only drawback was that, with all of the water the monkeys were sucking up, bathroom breaks took away whatever efficiency they had enjoyed. The next revolutionary work-inducing invention will be the in-cube toilet, no doubt. "The gene knockdown triggered a remarkable transformation in the simian work ethic. Like many of us, monkeys normally slack off initially in working toward a distant goal," he added. The original study was supposed to be finished months ago but the scientists involved knew they had lots of time to complete it and sort of, you know, slacked off until the last minute. This is common; I have a report for social psychology due on Friday and that's why I'm blogging right now.
