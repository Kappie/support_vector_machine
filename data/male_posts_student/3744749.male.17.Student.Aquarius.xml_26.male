An earth shaking argument ensued for the next few hours.  ...  "  Graffiti Taggers should know that police are taking special measures to catch them, and that those measures do pay off.     At hard-hit Santa Rosa Junior College the other night, police cadet Mike Peters was hiding, watching and listening when he heard someone shaking a can of spray paint. He radioed for officers, who caught two kids-both 17-year-old Santa Rosa High students-in the act of tagging a building.     One of the kids is believed responsible for the ubiquitous "MSG" tag that has cost property owners tens of thousands of dollars.     We'e hope firm punishment leads him and his buddy to explore better ways to make their mark."  ...  Kind of flattered by the paper calling us "ubiquitous", but at the same time its really frightening. Eventhough the article is small, it still made it to the papers. The full degree of how potentially fucked I am really hit me when I read it. Wasn't really aware it was that big of  thing. The figure seems a little steep and I also hate how it makes the po-lice come off as though they have been working towards catching the infamous group of hoolums behind the prolific tag "MSG" and there was finally a case break that lead to our arrest. It was merely chance that we were in the JC when they were and we just happened to be two of the people that write particular letters in a particular order that they happen to be looking for. It was just dumb fucking luck. We were really dumb to go to the JC... Ah. And the rumor about the existence of a branch of the SRPD Anti Graffiti Unit being specifically assigned to catch MSG is officially true. Fuck.
