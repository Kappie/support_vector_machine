I am planning to apply for a research project for next semester. You know, all postgraduate student in US would do some research in their postgraduate study. So to keep breast with the international rule, I think I should do some reseach, although the time is short.  Today, I got a mail from a supervisor that he told me there is a chance to work in National ICT Australian laboratory. I think probably I am not doing any research but working. Anyway, I'd like a try, for the big name of "National laboratory". I will be joining a project named "eMotion", it's not bad if I can really learn something from it.  Ihave some other choices, probably also just WORK in the university. So considering both of them are working, I'd rather choice a big place.   Yesterday, I talked with a bei's sister. I think her english has quite strong "Chinese" flavor although her thought is quite American. I don't like women to be very materialic. You know, true love is getting more and more precious in this world. I pray for my true love.
