I watched russian ark and this other flick which name i cannot recall but it was a depressing movie about a gay man and his first love and how nothing ever works out and sadness etc... so i was allready in a great mood. While i did this i drank. A lot. Alone. And cried. Not the best night, but i think i needed it as i felt much better afterwards, and sometimes i think i need times like that to cathartically(is that a word) get rid of all the stress and sadness that gets stored up because i don't really epress it that well. saturday. did laundry, met f. at pandoras and studied, quangs for lunch and than f. and i cuddled and watche d center stage. I love that flick so much. than went to gameworks for a's birthday, pretty fun even though i am not really into the whole video game thing, especially enjoyed the bowling. we saw d. there, that was nice, than just like hung out at my house for a while sunday, laundry and cleaning until tyler woke up and i could finally vacum, than real cleaning and than homework and movies etc. Did not get out of my pyjamas all day. Perfect. got my british history paper back today, b plus, not bad, though not as good as i had wanted. thats all i think cheers
