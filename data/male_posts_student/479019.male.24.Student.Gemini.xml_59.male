I never really thought about my parents being conservative until now. The debate came about from my mom mentioning that my dad's friend who is in town is a factory owner in Vietnam. I said something about how I'm against the "slave" labor in factories all over the world. She said that she thought it was a good thing, because people can now work. She goes on to talk about how countries are corrupt and messed up because of the people. She believed that they should just get their acts together. That enraged me. To me it's attitudes and ignorance such as that, which helps to perpetuate the horrible situations that exist in many nations caused by imperialism (cultural, political, and economic). This was the same sort of anger that I felt after hearing ignorant people call up talk radio shows. The lack of understanding of historical developments in nations and the result of those developments keeps people from fully understanding why so many things in the world are the way that they are. Then they formulate ignorant rationales for why they are the way they are.  *
