It's regents week and I already took my math regents and my euro midterm. Now I'm free for these two days. Then there's school on Friday. How lame is that? So, today it was Dan, Jimmy, Mal, Eric, Gavin, Tom and me. We went sleigh riding but it didn't work out. Gavin, Mal and Eric deserted us while we were sledding so we went to Jimmy's and told them to come. We hung out there for a while. I played Super Nintendo alot, Super Adventure Island. It's this game Jim has that I've loved since the day I moved into Smithtown. Oh, it was orgasmic. You see, as a child, I could never beat Mr. Octopus but today I did and I got up to world 4 but then I died. It was then a sudden state of depression. So you know, we just chilled and then Eric, Gavin, Tom and Mal went home. Then Jimmy, Dan and I went to what we thought would be huge hills at the tabernacle but we saw the hills were gone. We were gonna make a huge star of david in the field but we were way too tired. Hey, 3 w's in a row..."we were way." Nevermind. Anyways, then we walked to Dan's house through the tabernacle and past the Pope's house and then Dan went home, and Jimmy and I walked home talking about our economy, weird. Then I came home, ate dinner and found out I'm getting a cell phone. It's the same one Paul Stoltz has. It's an LG Verizon Flip Camera Phone, and I'm going to have the ring for Unloco - Bruises or some other Matrix song. It's gonna kick butt. Maybe I can put on something from the Spooner Street Mafia. Or Dan's Hey Jude ending is awesome. Or Hey Ya, datz eh gewd wun. I hope mine has angel farts on it. Ok, now Pat's coming to get my calculator for his test tomorrow, which I don't have any of. HAHAHA. Tomorrow is a day of band practicing. Bye. I'm gonna go drum now. Bye.
