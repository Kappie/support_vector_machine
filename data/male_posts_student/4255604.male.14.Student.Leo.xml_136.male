As usual everybody is welcome ... but with a few prerequisites : simple programming knowledge + basic PHP syntax which we covered last time in the session.   urlLink Sessions@Exun Website  has a slightly more refined version of the above text.  The tentative date is 13th August, this coming friday. We'll work with time conflicts, but this day seems perfect. Let's stick to it if we can.  The scheduled time is 1PM. We'd like to wrap up early, so we start early.  However, comment to tell us your problems.  Thanks, Mukul  P.S. - string Advanced; Advanced = "Basic PHP ... beyond syntax";
