That amendment established the popular election of US Senators.  Fundamentally, popular elections are a bad idea for the Senate.  The people have representation in the House of Representatives.  The Senate was established to represent the interests of the State.  Orignally, Senators were appointed by State Legislators and the Governer.  The population had no say beyond the election of their State officials, indirectly influencing who would be appointed.  So essentially, the States have had no official representation in DC since 1913, and the case for States Rights has declined since then.  We should restore the original intent of the Framers and repeal the amendment.  But I can't see it happening, since the average American is too uninformed to understand the ramifications.  The Left has managed to brainwash us into thinking we are a Democracy, and we should have a say in everything.
