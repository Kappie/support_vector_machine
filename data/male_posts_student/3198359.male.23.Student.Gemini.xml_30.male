Plus, it releases a new notebook chip, Dothan."   Have Intel finally realised that having a pipeline that stretches from the moon and back could possibly causing problems in the performance department. Maybe what Intel should do is something revolutionary; how about getting their processors to work more efficiently, yes, I know, that would be a miracle. The fact that they'll actually have to push something more tangible than the "well, this CPU is 5Ghz!".
