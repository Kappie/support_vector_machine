Teaching 'em how to operate the cash draw without seriously injuring themselves, how to take those stupid tags off clothes, etc. Other highlights include: - Someone spilling a load of water from some stupid thing from auqatics all over me, the desk, and a load of compost bags. - Stacking shelf-fuls of ant killer. - Some random old guy and me having the following conversation: Me "...haven't you already been through and paid?" Old guy "Yes, we've already been through here, but we went to the coffee bar and my wife decided to buy some more. Thats what you get for being married...heh." Me "Heh" *lil laugh* Old guy "Are you married?" At this point I had to restrain myself from staring at him and saying something like "what the fuck? I'm 16 damnit!"  Stupid Devils are about to be knocked out of the Stanley Cup...bah. The season Jack starts supporting the Flyers, the Devils start playing crap. Just my luck eh.  I found that v. funny log from Feb 15th....bwahahahaha. What a great day. And I got the best response ever from Mr. Syners d'Attenhoven with my latest artmonkeywork: "  AAWESOME!" Woohoo. And I found that classic old song "Sunshine, lollipops and rainbows". Very cheesy. Great lyrics.
