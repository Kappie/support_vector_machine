An extra half hour of walking around the parking lot and the entire campus because of frozen car door locks will quickly change your mind about "how pretty that farking snow is".  Also realized that while some people really do care about what you think and do for them, most people simply wish you would crawl into a hole and die. Especially if you aren't some slack-jawed pretty boy, which seem to inhabit around 2/3 of the earth's surface. Yes, that means they're as common as water.  A flash flood warning indeed.
