I could've installed it w/ keyboard commands, but then what?  I still don't ahve a mouse.  So, being the linux n00b i am, i'm going to search for a linux driver or wait till they have one (which is more likely) before i proceed.  *sigh*  and there went my fun little summer project.  for now anyway.  At least i still can build my trebuchet.  No mouse drivers needed :D
