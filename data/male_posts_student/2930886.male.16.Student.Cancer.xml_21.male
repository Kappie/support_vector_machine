Read both of my required reading books and another 3 books. 2.  the topics of one fo the books was programming in Basic and the other was a guide to HTML so there are three things on my list kindof done.  3.  I still haven't done anything for money, and money is what is needed to buy javalins and hammers, but i found really really cheap javalins for like $65 online so I'm going to order one.  4.  I have been working on the webpages for myself and the Debate team. So far I have about three fourths of the Debate team website done but I need to upload a couple of article which I am going to have to type. The ARC webste needs to be scratched and started over because  the links are messed up. Also I may change the pages because I found a way to make numbered lists which would help but I don't think it is necessary. 5.  I have been studying for my permit test, and I am going for it on Thursday. My dad has threatened to make me get my hair cut or he wont allow me to get it with him but those are empty lies. He said that before be never followed through with it. 6.  Tommorow actually I plan on going to pani Krysa's house and Brian's Aunt and Uncle and see if they have anything for me to do. Generally that is an easy couple of dollars.   Ok here is that list I probably had at least 2 or 3 times, here is what's done: 1.  Read the required reading  2. Do the projects really well 3.  Read some other books, like Catch-22 or something along those lines  4.  Retool the debate team website  5. Retool a ARC website 6. Retool my webpages 7. Get my permit 8. Get a Javalin and a hammer 9. Job and money 10.  Volunteer  11. New computer 12.  Internship (Can't do this, next year) 13. Lifting 14.  Learn C++ or some other programming language  (Working on basic right now actually, maybe going to move onto PASCAL or C)
