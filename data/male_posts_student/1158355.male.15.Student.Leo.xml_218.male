I had a little bit of homework so basically this day has been very happy. I'm gonna play CS now and then drums. Tomorrow night I think I'm going to see The Day After Tomorrow with James, Heaton and Rich and anyone else who wants to come. It's cool because we're seeing it and The Day After just reunited...I think I'm the only one that wants to keep it called The Day After. Actually I'm thinking of different names but according to James, Paul C would play guitar for us with Matt backup. We'll see what goes on. We're all a tremendous amount better than last year. Especially me. I sucked last year because I hadn't play drums alot and then I got back into it, an average 5 days a week, and between 2 and 8 hours a day. I pulled off 8 on a weekend once. Crazy. Speaking of averages I'm gonna be posting in here alot more, hopefully daily because I want the average posts a week to increase. I don't know why. Bye.
