My sister and I tried to put it together, but it was too complicated (read as: we were too lazy). So rather than going through the trouble of playing with a net, and with rules for that matter, we just served the birdie around. It was fun. My mom joined us after a while. We must've spent an hour playing, and I was pretty exhausted by the end. Yes, exhausted from  badminton . Man, I'm out of shape. :P
