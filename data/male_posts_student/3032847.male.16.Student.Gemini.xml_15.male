You could tell it was diahorrea wen there was no screamin? to it. I couldn't take any more. I stuffed my revision stuff in me bag for the next few days, passed on the pie and chips me mam offered me before I went, and escaped from the house. My mam was excluded from work on wednesday and thursday, when they found out that she was living with someone who had the active virus. For 48 hours. Tis friday now so Im back and safe- aren't I? :-O Cheers grandad for them two nights and all the bacon sarnies :-D  If you were unfortunate enough to see I'd posted two identical posts the other day, It's because I tried the email'y in blog thing- which buggered up 'cos it's turd.  Anyway- Tec exam brilliant, English writing exam brilliant, Geography exam smashing :-D and I've just got a lift home off Jamies mam from German- which was total bollocks. I've failed german without trying :-) Never mind...  RE this afternoon. We never had a teacher for the full two year course. I don't know a thing. Can't wait 'till tonight...  After today- SEVEN EXAMS LEFT!  PS- 'twas a highly contagious virus with symptoms similar to the ' Noro / Norwalk ' virus? ....
