I should really work on changing that . . . but sometimes it works to my advantage. A few weeks ago, I was surfing the net randomly after work when I came across an advertisement for  urlLink Poetry.com . On a whim, I decided to submit the following poem:  "Ephemerality"  My heart is a pellucid sepulcher For futile dreams and broken promises. Departed now, all visage of wonder, Of once conceived on foolish premises. This damned reliquary holds my soul. I acquiesce to anonymity. Forever yearning to become a whole, These sordid feelings lack delivery. Ephemeral existences belie Some hope of perfect, fleeting happiness. Reality, though, leaves me asking why, In heaven we still wait for providence. The litany of humankind is love. But is it something we are worthy of?  Anyone in Mrs. Egerer's English class last year will remember this assignment - we had to write a sonnet in Shakespearean style (iambic pentameter), loosely based on one of two themes. I chose the futility of love, which I definitely know a thing or two about. I guess "Ephemerality" is a reflection of my underlying cynicism and, to some extent, my ongoing search for purpose and happiness. At the time I wrote it, I thought it sucked royally (it was just for some lame assignment that didn't really matter). But apparently, the Selection Committee at Poetry.com thinks differently. My poem is going to be published in a collection called "Eternal Portraits," along with about 200 other poems. Also, I'm now eligible to win one of over 100 cash and medal prizes, including $1000 for first place (August 15) and $10,000 for the annual grand prize. Of course, I probably won't win these - they're meant for serious, professional poets. I'm just content with the honor of being published.
