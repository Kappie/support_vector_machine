I mean all the girls I have falling for are either too old, have a boyfriend, bitches, or my "favorite" too good of friends. Why can't I fall for a girl that can fit in with my friends, cool to talk to, and will actually go out with me. I want a girl that can be crazy but can still keep me in check. I need a girl like my best friend Brandi. And yes Brandi I know you will read this and probably say, "What the hell are you talking about!". But I have to say you are the sweetest, kindest and coolest people I know. And don't worry I think both of us will be able to find our fish. But for now at least for me the search continues.
