Revision is the currant bain of my life, there's always one isn't there... 3 hours a day may not sound like much, and to be honest it isn't really, it just seams like it when you really can't be fucked. (apologies to those with weak temprements - the swearing was totally nessesary however)  Go check out the Omega Project site. Nothing's changed - at all. :(. So in fact, don't bother checking the Omega project site: On that note, I really ought to finish and release a map at some point, Most of my creations in VHE are crap, however I am capable of producing some nice stuff when pressed, however - I never finish  anything . Never mind.    When My GSCEs are Over I may post again, maybe even befre they start, who knows? the world is truly, at its core, unpredictable.
