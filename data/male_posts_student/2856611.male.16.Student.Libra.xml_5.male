I then think "Hey forget it, I'll make plans with Hans" so I begin to make plans with Hans only the parents refuse to let me out without having dinner or anything which was really lame, so that throws my whole Idea of meeting up with Hans out the window as she had to be home at 6. Step two: See what Nick's up to, sadly him and Xav had gone somewhere so I couldnt exactly tag along at the last minute, anyhow, so Im sitting there bored and all when Mr. Phil rings back, turns out he can come by about 6ish, I say its fine. Get ready and everything only for him to ring back at 5 and explain that he cant come at 6 because hes got to drive to Bristol so in the end we left it. Which brings me onto the plans of my marvelous weekend which isnt shaping up that badly at all, just very busy, today Im seeing the wonderful Charli at 1, but then I got to go at 6 to get home for Phil so thats going to be a tight squeeze me thinks. THEN on Sunday the lovely Hans has given up some of her time so we can go get coffee's. We have also planned to go to McDonalds and we have a plan envolving a care bear happy meal.... heh heh heh. It's wierd, I've known Hans for aout 3 months kind of, but thats only 'every now and then' talk on MSN, then I actually saw her for the first time on Tuesday but I couldnt recognise her as I had never had a photo of her or anything, so that night we made plans to go out on Thursday. So that was like the very first time I met her but it doesn't seem like it, I feel as though I have known her for a while, meh, some serious mindless babbling going in this blog. Woaho Def Leopard is on TV... some rather interesting guitar riffs there, speaking of guitar my self taught talent is progressing quite well, since Christmas I have learnt alot, most people would thing its pretty easy stuff but its somewhat of an accomplishment for me. I really want a Strat-o-caster, but I need money, I dont think I'm able to get one for Â£4.50, do you? Anyhow yeah, Im going to go climb back Into bed, goodmorning candy caners with beautiful brainers.
