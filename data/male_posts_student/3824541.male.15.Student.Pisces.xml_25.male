I read a few things about the upcoming Harry Potter ;/, and that's when my dad caught me on the computer. He didn't say anything, and told me I had to make my bed, and then I could get back on. So, whatever.  Bobby and Britt kinda pissed me off earlier because I always have to call them; they don't call me. Ehh ;/.   To be continued?   .Music   I have been listening to Fall out boy - Chicago is so two years ago non-fucking-stop. Download it.
