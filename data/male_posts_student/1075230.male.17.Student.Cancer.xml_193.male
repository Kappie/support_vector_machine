Watched 12 episodes of Inuyasha this morning (woke up at 6:30am for some reason), and so far, I liked the 4 episodes where Inuyasha gets Tetsusaiga the most. I've seen most of the 12 episodes in english, and when compared, they seem to match fairly well. There could've been a lot that they could've edited, but they didn't, so kudos to them. Oh, not to mention they left the OP and ED fairly intact.   Speaking of anime, anime society was ok... lotsa problems on the first day. Lotsa people too. Ana-sama was late around an hour, cause she just came back from an art trip. Then there were "Technical difficulties" which prevented us from watching anime at all ^^ so bascially we just chatted and sketched, which was cool, but still.    Ahh... the sun dispersed all the clouds in the sky... must be a sign ^^ ... to get to work...    Addendum: happy thxgiving people! ^^ jus finish watching up to eps 32 of Inuyasha, that's all i have on me. Boy, did I ever underestimate the interesting-ness of that series... it's actually pretty good.    ~Chronos
