So this is it kids, this is the paragraph that I feel is so good, that I can't get past:   He woke up disappointed.  He woke up comma disappointed. He lay silently still under neon stars affixed and inadvertently dangling.  The stucco ceiling always reminded him of icing from a cake just this close to falling.  Tired hands helped remove the early morning fog as his gaze wandered around the room.  Red numbers in the distance confirmed he did not want to be awake this early.  As he flexed and stretched he noticed his jeans had slipped down past his waist and currently were bunched up in a ball around his ankles.  But his boxers were still on.  The voice of Lindsey’s voice echoed in his mind, “Just do it for me, you never know.”  As if he was going to spontaneously inseminate her in the middle of the night or he would wake up inside of her.  I think the thing this story has going for it so far is I some how managed to use the term "spontaneously inseminate" in a creative fashion.  Come to think of it, I don't know how that term could be used uncreatively
