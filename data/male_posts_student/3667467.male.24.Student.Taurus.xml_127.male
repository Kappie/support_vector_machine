This week I had a great radio show, where each song was preceded by an audio clip from that great movie, "Shaft." It was so good it should have been recorded. And you know what? It WAS, thanks to Blank Tapes! Now I can relive all of the great moments I had, which in some cases will be the first time because I kept falling asleep! And last night, whilst watching reruns of Saturday Night Live on Comedy Central, they just happened to be playing the episode where the one and only Natalie Imbruglia sings! Thanks to Blank Tapes, I have this earth-shattering, breakthrough first American performance close at hand for all posterity! Thank you, Natalie, for an amazing live version of "Torn!" And thank YOU, Blank Tapes!  Shaft: "Why don't you stop playing with yourself, Willie?"
