It's a good course, the lecturer is real nice and all. Yeah. I was doing my Chinese homework at night, then rushed online at 9 to check stuff for project work. Yeah. Do you know? For reading an article at NewsLink, the school have to pay $2? 2 bucks per article viewed. Wow!   Today, Mr Tham said that by signing your 2 years at a JC, you are signing out your free time. Yeah. He's damn right. I have hardly a time for leisure at weekends now, provided, of course, I have no homework for the next day. I just came online after doing my Chem titration calculations. Ergh! Anyway, he's funny today. Yeah. He calls our homework "ta pao" and he really went to label the maths problems "T.P. 1 and T.P. 2"! Oh my god! He's so funny and cute! We laughed when we saw the labels lor. What a funny teacher! HAHAHA! :D  Ayioh! Die le la. Tomorrow got Chem test. I didn't really study. Wait. Let me rejurigate the hydrocrarbon combustion equation [CxHy + (x + y/4)O2 --> xCO2 + (y/2)H2O]. Okay. That one done. Yeah. Redox. Must know the equations de leh. Ayiah...so idioitc. I never memorized, and I think I will do it tomorrow la. Ayiah..the test is actually during our lecture, and that's the first period of the day. How to study? Meow la!  Today I went home after Chem tutorial with Zahiah (correct spelling? Dunnoe..too lazy to take out class list and check) and Aisha. HaHa. Zahiah and me take the same bus back (964/913) and she stops at the stop before Admiralty. HaHa. Yay! Finally someone in our class living near moi. Heh Heh!   Damn it. I feel so tired. I still got unfinished businesses! Darn! Okay...I gotta get going. See ya later! Night blog!
