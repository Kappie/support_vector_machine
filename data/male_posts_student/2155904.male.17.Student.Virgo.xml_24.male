He is a decent song writer but really he isn't very good.  It is hard to write a song.  You have to concentrate.  Tyke wrote a full song once.  It was pretty good.  Well maybe not but it was decent.  He has made some stabs at writing in the past but really only one full song.  Today was another pretty normal but not too exciting day for Tyke.  1st period consisted of making up names for children and changing current names.  Tina and Karla and Tyke were the only ones thinking about this but it was really funny.  It really was.  Hilarious at times.  And what if you could just start putting accents on letters in your name?  Like say if your name was Chris and you put the accent over like the H or the R.  That would be sick.  Or if you were just like, "Yeah, my name is Chris but my friends call me H."  (Cuz the accent is on the H and then they only say that letter...well it doesn't make sense if you weren't there at the time but it was funny then)  Baby names are kinda fun to think about too.  2nd period was not important enough to talk about.  3rd period was pretty much the same.  4th period Tyke and Purdy talked about baby names some more.  Lunch stupid except Tyke played his insanely sick mix.  Eh, it is fun to listen to at least.  But some people apparently don't like techno.  Purdy said she thought it was stupid.  But if that is true then why does she have fun playing DDR???  ANSWER ME THAT!!!  5th period pointless.  6th period was kinda fun cuz they talked about attraction and stuff.  And think about this one: What if all people that you had no attraction to you would repel from when you went to touch them?  And then the person that you were "supposed to be with" was the opposite of you or whatever so when you went to touch them you wouldn't repel so you could touch him/her.  Then you would know who your mate would be!  How cool would that be!!!  What is love?  Baby don't hurt me.  Don't hurt me.  No more.  (bob head and repeat)
