Do you think you're capable of murder? Um, I want to say no, but I might be. It really depends on the situation. I've done stuff when I'm angry that I'd rather not admit. Not in cold-blood though, I could never kill anyone in cold-blood. .. Do you always wear a seat belt? always, it's a habit .. Are you Catholic? no .. Have you ever shoplifted?
