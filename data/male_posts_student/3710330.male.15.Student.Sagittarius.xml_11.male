It had been the last two remaining days, till the vicious truth would be made know to me., before, my time would be up.  Today, started with a very boisterous assembly, with many sceptical looks at each other and uncertainties of the day's agenda. Mr. Chew Hua Soon had confirmed with us today had to be it, and William Wee could never agree more. And then,after more sweating and worrying, Mr Alvin Lim had to announce the occasion in front of the whole school. That was enough to set my spincter muscles(perhaps Yongshan may help in this) loose. Maybe, everyone's, and flood the sewage system in Singapore, before the clock strikes 1045hr, then perhaps, everyone would be too busy desperately attempting to escape the wave that had culminated into a tsunami.  Fat hope.  In class, the tension still prevailed. For me, this was not my first time experiencing it. Never had I felt nostalgic of the first, and never will I have it for a third. No retakes for me, no nothing. I greatly reviled it, detested it. The previous had been a terrible shock to me. The contempt I had for it, backfired upon me. I paid a hefty price for my disdain. The shame I felt was devastating, exhausted me completely. My Mum, could not accept it well and it took me 3 days to explain to her. Three days of quarrels and unhappiness. No one could have felt empathy for me then. I deserved it and I knew it. Nil Sine Labore, nothing without labour, I faced it every day but the need for hardwork never occurred to me. I entered the examination hall in high spirits and came out, fearing the worst, but hey, this is Chinese language(CL) "O" levels, not Higher Chinese language(HCL) "O" levels. There is a big difference between the both, the latter being of extreme difficulty and the other "even the dumbest person could get an A1 for it". It appeared countless of times in my mind before, no HCl student disagreed with me. For a HCL student, getting an A1 for CL was no mean feat.  I had travelled into the school six months ago, feeling slightly anxious, but I deemed that as only a notion of the excitement in receiving an A1. It was supposed to coincide with the release of the "O" level results for our Secondary four seniors last year. The periods went past freely, teachers rambling on and the last three were free periods...I still remember vividly. We were made to work on Japan's economic progress for Social Studies, but the HCL students were too excited to concentrate. Chung Chi, had started expressing his fears in Mandarin. He started quoting Mr. Chew as saying," the score for an A1 this year would have to be 82 and above." His words were menacing enough, but my ego kept me from fearing more. If I could even continue in HCL for that long, I was certain, an A1 was possible, even if I had not revised that much. After all, I had only missed 2 marks in the spelling section.  When recess came, I broke off into a sprint, and plunged into the mass of heads suffocating the staircase.I managed to squeeze my way through and descended the seven storeys. A crowd had formed in front of the noticeboards, and hurtled myself into the crowd, but realised the barrier being too strong to penetrate. I tip-toed on my feet and squinted your eyes at the blurred board. I slowly edged my way into the crowd and scanned the board again and spotted the long list of papers tacked onto the board.  I got closer and started searching the board for my name. I could feel my heart racing in me, and at that moment everything manifested.  A B3.
