And he doesn't  And in the end  Its like  Love finds a way.  And its beautiful.  But what it captures  Is the heartbreak  The time spent waiting  Thinking  Wondering  Will she ever call  Did she mean that  And then  Happy ending  And it just made me want to talk to her more  I'm gonna quit my job  Gimmie my paycheck  All I want  Is for her to love me back  Like in the movie  I want her to knock on my window at 3 am  And be like  We need to talk  I would be like  Mmmhmm yeah we do  And then I would tell her how much I loved her  Roll credits  But she already knows  That's why I'm there  All the time  Fuck I miss her  I miss the talks  The reassurance  The oh shit I can't believe I just said that  So if your reading  And you know who you are  I love you  I miss you  And I'm sorry.  And you'll never know how much I care about you.  And  And  And  if you counted the number of times I cried over you  You'd need to use your fingers and your toes  And this is sam  Crying  Doesn't happen.  I play the stoneface  Ice cold  Type of thing  Not the touchy feely  Sweater vest wearing  Type of thing  But I would  I would for you  I might even eat a peanut butter and pickle sandwich for you  But only if I knew I'd be getting some  And you'd need to bring a friend  But the thing about you is  I never wanted to fuck you  I never jacked off to you  I just wanted to sit  And talk  And hold you  And I don't think that will ever happen with us  But if you want  Call  24 hours a day  Because  Simply  I'm in love with you
