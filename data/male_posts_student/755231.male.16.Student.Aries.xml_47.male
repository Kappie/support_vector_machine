That really has my fur in a tangle. I�m going to have to re make all that. Really not cool. But now I guess I have to manage my computer better. I gotta get a hold of chris so he brings his laptop tomorrow, I�m hoping he goes online. Or I could just call him. Well really no one actually on. Just me I�ve been sketching with Night�s pen because I lost mine. I need a new pen so badly. Where are my markers, Jens? *grr*   -warm wuff cub hugs -Kit Wolf  HEY ITS RAINING PRETTY HARD OUTSIDE!!!!!!!!! YAY!
