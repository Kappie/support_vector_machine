It's always nice to take a field trip somewhere and listen to people talk, all while on the clock.  As you can see from the link, the ARC is in the middle of a park, on top of a golden hill surrounded by other golden hills.  Quite a setting.  People there talked about searching the web for stuff, MRAM, less practical physics stuff, and trying to improve IBM's services.
