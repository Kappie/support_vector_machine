Then Matt and I were going to go to Wild Water West to celebrate Sam's birthday party but we didn't get there until about 7:30 and the waterpark closed at 8. Oh well...sorry Sam, we tried. Instead of going swimming, Matt and I went to his house and played Monopoly. I had fun. I think I'm gonna go to crew call tomorrow if I wake up in time. Talk to ya later!
