Had no mood to do it, i was physically and mentally tired then, but i could get myself to sleep...so i doodled to pass time. After which i went home for a little nap before eden popped over to wake me up from my nirvana, and we left...it was drizzling. and for no apparant reason, my nose started bleeding. Bloody hell, this is the second nosebleed i had this year since.....ages. i think its because of those sleepless nights and heatyness, maybe i haven been eating well, as in, fried, oily, fattening and high-colestrol stuff. We went to pick up jonathan from the school in a cab and headed for kels place. Went there, did the usually, played games and tok cok, usually i'm always the one watching them play some fighting game whatsoever, and when its my turn to play, i'll always load in the same game all over and over again, which is winning eleven 7 (soccer game dear). i got bored and wanted to go meet u in katong, miss u too much ya...haha. moving on....hmm nonetheless after all that me and kel had a great time though...going album shopping...we found a place where they sold metal music for cheap, like, 10 bucks for every album...but they are second hand, who cares anyway? we went to delifrance for dinner and had one of the worst sandwiches we have ever eaten in our lives. DONT GO TO DELIFRANCE. I went to get a mother's day gift for my godmum, which consisted mostly food....lol, trying to give her something new rather then the old stuff toys and things which she cant put to good use, might as well give her food. So i thought about it, and the word food hamper popped right out of my ears into my head. We had trouble finding a cab at night...waiting for about an hour and still no luck. And its irritating to see that a guy just walks across the road, raises his hand for less than a min, and a taxi comes by to pick him up, whereas two teenagers on the other side of the road, who have been standing there an hour ago still hasnt got one. So i took the last choice, call my sister and i got her to pick me and kel up....hmm...thats all about yesterday...its 6.48 now and i have been writing this long blog entry since 6.00. I think its time to stop and continue later about what happened today..going for dinner...ciao!
