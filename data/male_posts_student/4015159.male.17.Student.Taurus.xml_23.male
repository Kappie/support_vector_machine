The plot isn't brilliant but the script is as strong as a bull and keeps you laughing at the PURE geordie humour!          I also watched The Ring last night! Thats a PRO movie, and I was just thinking about what makes a good horror movie, and I think it is real things. For Example: in The Ring it's about a video tape and a phone! They're everyday objects and thats why it makes it scary, the creepy dead people faces don't help!          I might do a post later, see how I feel. TTFN peeps!
