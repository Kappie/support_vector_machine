For one i am no longer in Houston, Texas but i have now permanently relocated to Niagra Falls, Ontario, Canada, the tourist town. So ya it is pretty nice here and i prefer this weather over the hot weather in Houston. All I've been doing so far is just settling in and absorbing the new surroundings because yet again, i have moved to a totally new area. There will be alot more things available to me and i think i'll be finding more comfort here. I actually have my own room...something i haven't had since i left edmonton, which has now been officially 2 years because it's August.  So now ill try to keep updating my blog so some of the people i know can keep up on some tabs. Later days.
