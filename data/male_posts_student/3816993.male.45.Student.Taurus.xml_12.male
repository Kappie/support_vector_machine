By far, those of Japanese descent had substantially larger numbers and longer periods of such treatment. Nonetheless, I was very surprised to learn of a documentary entitled    urlLink Una storia segreta (quando essere italiani era un crimine)    chronicling the similar experiences of Italians and Italian-Americans in the U.S. at that time.   Unfortunately, this type of response towards certain groups continues after the horrible attacks of September 11th. Muslims and Arab-Americans report and face  urlLink suspicions, threats, and prejudice  even to this day. I acknowledge that I’ve had some of these very same fears and suspicions. Now that I know that the same happened to U.S. citizens and immigrants of Italian descent some 60 years ago, I have a greater empathy and understanding of what many Muslims and Arab-Americans are experiencing today.
