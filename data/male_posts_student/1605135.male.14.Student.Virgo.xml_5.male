     
      Welcome to my new blog.  I can't stand the boring intro stuff, so if you want to know anything about me, just read my profile.  I'll try to keep this blog updated, but I've never been good at anything diary-like.  This'll probably just be for my random thoughts and ramblings, whenever I'm bored enough.
