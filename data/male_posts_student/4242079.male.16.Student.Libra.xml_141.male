As much as I would love to move to Calgary right now, it simply isn't feasible. The notice is too short, the money isn't there. And to top it all off, I don't think that's what I want to do anymore. Oh well, as is life. I think I would rather take out a loan and get a car anyway. My car is dying a slow, painful and drawn out death. Stupid thing.  Now, I am going for ice cream.
