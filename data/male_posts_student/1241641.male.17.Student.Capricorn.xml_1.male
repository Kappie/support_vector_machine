I wrote about my concerns with Bush starting a war and citing God.  It turns out I'm not the only one.  Ron Reagan also had this to say on Larry King Live:  "Well, you know, there was that answer he gave to the question about, did you talk to your father about going into Iraq? No, I talked to a higher father, you know, the almighty. When you hear somebody justifying a war by citing the almighty, God, I get a little worried, frankly. The other guys do that a lot. Osama bin Laden's always talking about Allah, what Allah wants, that he's on his side. I think that's uncomfortable."  But he didn't stop his criticisms there...  KING: Do you have thoughts on the war? REAGAN: Sure, I have thoughts on the war. KING: And what do you think? REAGAN: And I think we lied our way into the war. KING: You think it's a mistake? REAGAN: Absolutely, a terrible mistake. Terrible foreign policy error. We didn't have to do it. It was optional. And we were lied to. The American public was lied to about WMD, the connection between Osama bin Laden and Saddam, which is virtually nonexistent except for fleeting contacts. But they're still trying to pull that one off now, Cheney and all are out there flogging that. KING: Can I gather from that, that you will not support this president? REAGAN: No, I won't. KING: Will you support his opponent? REAGAN: I will vote for whoever the viable candidate is who can defeat George W. Bush, yes.   urlLink Read the full transcript here.
