We were there for nine hours or so and were walking around most of the time, so that got kinda boring. My mom drug us into the Pepsi Coliseum to watch this horse show thing. That was real interesting....yeah. After that, we heard Reba startin her concert, so we walked over there. We didn't get tickets, but we stood around the grandstand. I saw reba's head!....heh. At least i think it was reba...i couldn't tell for sure. Coulda been a body double lip syncin for all i know. Got home bout an hour ago. I'm going canoeing tomorrow. No guys could come so far, so it's me and a buncha girls unless someone changes their mind.
