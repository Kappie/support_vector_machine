True, things are cheaper there but I don't really think it's worth it. Then again this rarely happens and it's their time, not mine. Speaking of which, perhaps I should have went, time today was really wasted. I should have done something.  Searched the internet for digital cameras today, I'm hoping to get something which is quite slim, yet gives good pictures and preferably holds more than 1 picture? lol, make that 30. Most importantly I'm hoping that is has a fast phototaking time, once during a school concert, while I was taking photos for ST club, I pressed the shutter button but when the camera finally "clicked" the people on stage were gone. Sheesh.. Jeanie does your camera have that problem?  Oh wait... Parents are back, I'll be back after greeting them and so on and so forth. *back* In any case, my sister is not to pleased about something my mother bought for her, because she wants to choose it herself. After boo-hooing and screaming and shouting, I found out from my mother that she bought... Bras. Well! No one is going to see them anyway, so why so fashion concscious unless they are uncomfortable? Then again, this is a girl's issue and I will desist from commenting futher for fear of insulting female readers  Momma also bought a shirt for me. I find it horrendous. Look at if yourself.  urlLink    WC (the brand) other than meaning "wild channel" can also mean "water closet" or, old-fashioned toilet bowls.  urlLink     Look and stand in horror! It's yellow! Anyway, I do not like bright colours. I only like black clothes, nothing else. Unless it's dark, then I think I will like it as well. But yellow? And I don't think I like that bullseye target thing, cupid aiming for my heart? Sorry, but it's made of stone so even if you hit accurately cupid, I can't promise you that even your steel arrows can penetrate. And what's that man with horns on the head...  Anyway according to my mother, my father chose this shirt because my surname means yellow in chinese. What kind of reasoning is that? In anycase, I'll wear that shirt, because I hate wasting money, but my mother never learns that she must never buy clothing for me... then I'm forced to wear clothing like water closets or something.  Joke of today: What does LiLin do when she had a boring day? Answer: She Doesen't Blog! Hahaha! huh? oh, right, yep people all over the world are giving me that -_-" face again.
