No...I put sunscreen on but the sun ABSOLUTELY LOVES to find ways to annoy hell out of me. Anyways, the seconf day there we went to the malls and whatnot. That was kinna fun. Took me forever to find something to buy for Mario. But it seems I have found the perfect thing.Heh heh heh! The 3rd day we went shopping some more and then went to the Aquariam they had. The next day was our last day and so we awoke and hit breakfast buffets. YUMMY! I got home and was extremely relieved. I was away from the people I loved more than anybody on the face of this planet.....my friends. Oh yeah by the way....HAPPY INDEPENDENCE DAY! Well cyaz people!!!!
