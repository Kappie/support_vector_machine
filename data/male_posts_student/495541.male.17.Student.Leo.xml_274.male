I don’t know whether that’s my own insecurity or just the fact that I see how poorly other’s write in their blogs.  You won’t see me say mine is an exception.  I just get so inspired to put something in this empty page.  When I see my page is expired two weeks, I feel out of it.  I would like to go away as much as possible from citing a song that inspires me to write something… anything at all.  I love music but reading lyrics I find… is boring in the blog setting.  You can’t exactly get the correct mood to understand what the blogger is putting this song in their post and for what reason.  Because of this, I will simply explain as outright as possible my feelings and thoughts.  So many blogs are not blogs.  They are online journals disguised as blogs.  Mine is included.  I just want to leave you with one verse.   And He that sat upon the throne said, "Behold, I make all things new." And He said unto me, "Write, for these words are true and faithful."  Rev. 21:5
