We chatted till WQ came. Me and WQ then took the MRT towards Kallang MRT. How meowful. We listened to his discman on most of the journey.   Hm. We went to buy some drinks, then went to wait for bus 11 (I assure you, it is not a joke. There's really a bus 11. I thought WQ was joking when he said we are taking bus 11, which means we walk la. HaHa!), which didn't came for a long long time. Hmm... We finally arrived at Indoors Stadium at 3.  Woah! The queue is considerably short ma. We queued up at the "With Bags" queue (we shoulda queued up at the "No Bags" queue, they moved faster when going in). Hmm. WQ left to look for more drinks and food to buy.  What a surprise. I saw Sonia there. She was with Max. She was in the No Bags queue. So good! She informed me that MeiYing and WeiLin is at the Red Carpet. Woah!! HaHa. So many Riversidians there. Meow moo! Oh my...the wait was terrible though. It was like until 5 then they started letting people in. We were very bored waiting. I mainly eavesdropped on the group of people (the only male there is a CHC member, he was defending HYS) in front of us. Bo liao ma. I also eavesdropped on the people behind me too. Talk so loud. HaHa! Sonia came a few times to talk and borrow WQ's camera. HaHa!  By 5, we started to go in. It was as smooth as I wished. There were major stops here and there. It was around 5.45 when we finally went inside the gates for our bags to be checked. Meow moo. When we were admitted into the stadium, it was 6. Meow moo meow!   We were herded into the West section. Hmm.. it was not too crowded. We have space to move around. We got quite a good view la. The cameraman was the only one blocking our view. HaHa. Everybody was quite irrtated at him at one point and shouted at him to siam. Not me though. Heh.   In came my nightmare. 3 Vanness fans suddenly appeared! They started shouting for Vanness. I was like nearly deafened by them (coz one stood to my right). Meow moo. I really hates it whenever Vanness comes on stage, which is every so often because he's the host, because those girls will start screaming. Meow moo!  At 7+, the show started. HaHa! Vanness looked quite cute. His English is very accented though. I wonder who taught him. Michelle Branch was in a really revealing halter (she said in TNP interview that she had lotsa tapes). Of course, they changed costumes a lot of time, but Michelle always wore a halter. Meow moo.  Hmm. The awards show is not bad la! Quite enjoyable too. I really like the performances! Heh Heh! Of course, the favorite is Black Eyed Peas' finale performance of Where Is The Love and Shut Up. I also liked the performance by Simple Plan and Gareth Gates (with Siti Nurhaliza). Meow moo!   Lets talk about the awards. Hmm. Most of them I am quite okay la. I don't like the cats who won the Best Video and Favorite Female awards. For Best Vid, Linkin Park won, but I was hoping for Justin or Christina. For Favorite Female, it went to Christina. I was hoping either Beyonce, Dido or Michelle Branch to clinch that award. Hmm. Meow moo meow! Stephanie won Favorite Artiste Singapore! Go Steph! HaHa. She said it hoped it would be going to Tanya next year (poor Tanya the underdog). Meow moo! Sun Ho (such a stupid name. HYS is good enough) will never win de la! When her names come out, there are a few applauses and even boos. Heh!  After the MAA ended, me and WQ wanted to take taxis back home de. Idiotic taxis!! No taxis!! Lousy! We had to take the MRT and bus home lor. HaHa. MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW!! After coming back home, I ate and drank supper (SO HUNGRY AND THRISTY!), then went to bath and then to sleep lor.    Sunday   Hmm. Today morning don't narrate la. Same old thing de. I shouldn't eat the carrot cake. Woah liao! I got diarrhea. Always get diarrhea when I eat that de. Hmmmp!!   OMG! I found out that ny Neofriend was one of the 3 crazy Vanness cats. She came online with the nick about Vanness rocks during MAA. I asked if she was in my sector. She said yes. HaHa! So qiao hor! Even ducks meow!!   Hmm. Later hor, I will be online, but won't be blogging. That's why I am blogging now la. Channel 5 and Channel 8 is so conflicting! At 7, 5 is showing Moulin Rouge. I wanna watch!! However, at the same time, 8 is showing Unbeatables! I wanna watch Zoe Tay fighting against the Tay Ping Hui!! How to watch like that!! So meowingly meow meow moo!! Never mind, swtich on two TVs and keep running to and fro between them.  Well. I think I end le la. I got lotsa things to do. See ya tomorrow! Bye bye!
