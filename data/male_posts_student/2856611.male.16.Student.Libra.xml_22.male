Microwave Dinners, there not that bad! Okay anyhow pretty sweet few kick ass days, last Wedensday I saw the Red Hot Chili Peppers! It fucking ruled! I was sat down but I managed to stay with Holdstock(?!) throughout the whole thing so it was cool, James Brown was awsome, really, for a man of his age he has alot of stage spirit, doing all these jumps and stuff. He sang Sex Machine which was cool and he kept shouting "IM GONNA COUNT IT OFF!" and then his 'chicks' would shout "We cant start until you count it off" and then he for another 5 minutes would shout "IM GONNA COUNT IT OFF!" then... finally he did count it off and yes... the 'chicks' did start. Heh on the way home we saw an ambulance drive through town and I said to Holey - "Awww man... there goes James Brown" heh oh that crazy guy. Chicks On Speed were on before James Brown and too be honest the less said about them the better. The Chili's! NOW THEY WERE AWESOME! Never been so impressed with a band in my life, they played Cant Stop, Around the World, Californication, Get On Top, Scar Tissue, Throw Away Your Television, Fortune Faded, Otherside and loads more and each one was kick ASS, my fave was Around the World cause there was so much energy in it. Yeah then on Thursday Xav and Nick came over and we wobbled down to A Shot In The Dark for some Coffee, and Nick had their strongest coffee which is suprisingly called 'A Shot In The Dark', wasn't that strong really. Nick and Xav had some Lasagne aswell, which I paid for! But yeah it was all cool, then they both somehow ended up at my house to stay over which meant Xav spent all night making up stuff about monkeys and bikes and Nick lifted weights, I fell asleep *smiles* heh heh heh. Then the next day Xavs mum rang to say we had a meeting with our head teacher about the C-Fest thing which was pretty cool but we had like 3 hours in between so we made a third in the series of Homestar Runner movies: Dangeresque 3! which you can download there but beware its like 18 meg - click  urlLink HERE  for it. So then after we made that we walked down to the school whilst playing multiplayer Bop-It, the meeting went well, it was like to discuss the sound system and the interlude and stuff which is now all sorted. Then I got home and went out more or less straight away to see Charli which was great cause I was missing her alot so that was really cool we went to see Jersey Girl which wasnt that bad, Jenniffer Lopez died within the first 15 minutes so I was happy. Then I went home, woke up the next day and didn't feel to good so I had to go back to sleep for a while then Charli gave me a ring and asked to go out but I was too ill. I went back to bed when XAV calls and asks to go out, I still felt ill so I said no, then I couldn't get back to bed so I rang Charli and said if she gave me two hours I would see how I felt but we just decided to see eachother another day. Then I gave Xav a ring and explained the same thing and then eventually met him in Pizza hut where we drank loads of Pepsi and then I saw the new guitar he's getting which is gorgeous, it really is. Later we walked back to Xav's and stayed there a while, we all watched Dangeresque 3 (Me, Max, Xav, Roar and Nick) and then all excpet Max headed up to Alex' house for his party which was full of townies but it had a trampomoline! A TRAMPOMOLINE! That was pretty cool it was fun like a full size one, gymnastic stylee! A few drinks and a guy name Dan later me and Xav stumbled home to sleep, I fell asleep listening to Evanescence at his house to wake up in the morning and find out HE had been listening to them, but wasnt imensly impressed. Meh. I then had some toast and went to Nicks, heh heh heh where I played on a scooter and played some-not-so-good-piano-pieces-that-I-made-up. Eventually I got home but Was'nt allowed out to see Charli so I settled for calling Ross over and watching Muse at Glastonbury with some Ice-Cream. Woke up this morning. Now I have to go to a hospital appointment and lie when promising to wear some other crazy new invention for my legs. Ooo and tonight I get to see Charli which im pretty freaking happy about cause im really missing her, stoopid restrictive rules and days... hmmm... Im getting new shoes soon! NEW SHOES! Meh, Im tired, so long children that play on the road and sometimes with chickens....
