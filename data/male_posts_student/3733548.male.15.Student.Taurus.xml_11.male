WHY DONT WE FREAKEN MOVE TO LAKELAND!? sorry about that recent outburst, just a little thing. umm, well, I wish we would move, I've got the best friends ever here, (no offence to the Fort Meadeans who accept me, though  you are so few in number) and people accept me. and I'd just really like it. either move or the stupid state law changes and lets me drive alone now... that'd be great, I'm not a bad driver.... maybe i Should do that now anyways, break the law, its not like i havent done it in the past. but o well... well i had much much more to write, but i gotta write an email now too, so Ill talk to all the few people that read this blog later, Goodnight
