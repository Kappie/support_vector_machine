	 
       Tonight was the first night in nine months that I was able to get to my desk without having to jump, or crawl or weave my way around piles of notebooks, without looking like a hieroglyph. This feels more like freedom then you could know.   Why it hasn’t been cleaned up, I could give you plenty of excuses. I hate excuses.    Jump back to middle school, back when I thought I still had control. I gave my English teacher at least half a dozen excuses in twenty minutes to why I hadn’t circled all the verbs in a story I was given. After my through scalding in front of the entire class which also had my first girlfriend in it, I made up more excuses of why I hated my teacher so much.   Pulling out a year-old paper from my old notebooks and trying to eye some grey hairs on my mom, I listen to my little cousin ramble on about computer games. I try to hide my grin, because he sounds almost exactly like me from a few years ago.   My mother’s been busy. Too busy to help me or even bother to yell at me for the bombshell that is an excuse for my bedroom. I’m not whining because she has been through a lot, and even after all the screaming and fighting that happened about two hours ago, I’m still not angry at her. I should be angry at myself or some bullshit like that. Any therapist will tell you that bottled up anger can damage a person's health. “Damage,” or in other words, bring you’re hunting rifle to the top of the school and start picking off Emo’s. I wish I had the balls to do that, but the truth is I haven’t touched my rifle in about nine months, except for a Sunday in May when I cleaned it out.   By busy, I mean my mother’s been driving my grandmother to and from chemotherapy or chemotherapy checkups. This is in-between my sisters physical therapy, because my sister has Cerebral Palsy. This is also in-between driving me to summer school, friend’s houses, and bass lessons. Shit, that reminds me, I still haven’t touched the damn thing. I haven’t fucking picked it up all week. I haven’t sat down and jammed in what seems like years, but it’s probably around nine months. And I used to be such a good kid.   Seriously, whenever they ask you in health class who is your idol, I say, my mother. Everyone, and even the girls, say their father or some celebrity. If I sat down and read a book about finding out people’s past lives, I’m almost fucking certain that mom would be either a be a scotch drinking general or a wine drinking, bread braking martyr.  Mom, for the first time in almost a year, is helping me clean out my room. Why it’s so dirty, she isn’t sure. Probably because she can’t ask because it’s lost in her brain, next to Grandma’s reallyreallylongtumorname and my GPA. Maybe she does know, but if she did, I’d probably be in a therapist’s office or something she’d make time to take me too.  She opens up my sliding closet door and right off the bat, she asks, “What is my cooler doing here?” Oh shit. I know this routine. I already know the whole story, where the plot twists are and everything, even before it has begun. I make up some excuses, subtlety hinting that my little thirteen-year-old cousin, Donald, should exit the room. He picks up in it quick, and I’m glad because I like him so much. I didn’t want him anywhere near the fallout of the explosion that’s going to erupt any moment now.  After my cousin leaves, Mom sends the international warning sign for “What the FUCK?” Her skin, starting to wrinkle, her hair, probably graying under layers of dye, her hands, weak and white knuckled; under all of this, is a brain that’s frying itself with disappointment and rage. That could be my brain too.  Under the flames and cracking sounds that my brain is making. Under the flat, grinding sounds a hard drive makes when it starts to really spin up, I smile. My mother is about as confused as black man in my neighborhood. I smile some more, and wait to hear my cousin’s voice fade until I know he’s out of the house.  Quarantined.  Contained.  Locked Down.  Safe.    I get discouraged because I remember how I got my cousin out of the room. Pointless excuses. Yeah, dude, check up on the Air Conditioning filter, and see if it’s still on. I don’t remember what I used, but I’m sure it was something of that caliber.  Christ I hate when I bullshit. Everyone knows it and I feel terrible afterwards. As if excuses have gotten me anywhere these last nine months.  As if I amounted to anything.  Before she can question more, I lean against my dresser and think back to the first time I got wasted. Everything slows down, the way it does when you take too many serotonin pills or when you drink so much that you’ll experience a kind of slowness, like a lag in a first-person-shooter, or when you launch miniature versions of yourself during an orgasm. Life is really just a bunch of uppers or downers. It was the first of November.   We’re at Tom’s. The Triad. Tom, Philip, and I. I can just see us all signing up for the next world war together. The first one to get killed would probably be Phillip. We talked this over.  This isn’t the first time I’ve drank. We’ve been at it since middle school. Drinking because media and church groups telling us how bad it is. Well, we were bad, in the current situation’s standards. Drinking, listening to loud, Satan approved rock music, and in our underwear, and not doing our homework. And I used to be such a good kid.   No sticker on any album ever warns you that you might already be slowly dieing from listening to it with a combination of drinking and bad grades. They really should.   The point being, there is, in fact a level under badass. A level no teenager, or aspiring artist, or suburbanized eunuch is ever warned about. School doesn’t tell you because they know that a couple kids in the building every year eventually do hit bottom. Parents don’t even bother because they know it’ll never happen to their kid. Why would God let their son get like that, when they already have a tumor for a senile mother and a daughter who has Cerebral Palsy? I mean, their son has already survived car accidents and bad grades and ski accidents that make their insurance higher then the cost of buying their own personal paramedic. God just isn’t that cruel.     God used to be such a nice guy, right?   In Tom’s basement, listing to disco records, trying to piece together our own parent’s generation understanding of life, as if cheating is getting us anywhere, we’re all drinking and partying.   Tom’s basement has a little swing door that is meant to fix pipes if they ever have a leak. A small crawl space no deeper than two, two and half feet tops- exist between a sense of twisted accomplishment and the real world. We’ve been chucking our empty bottles down there for what seems like forever, but it’s actually just been the last three years.   We’ve lost about half a dozen lighters down that crawl space. One gets satisfaction from looking at that, even if it’s only for a brief second before the lighter starts to cook your thumb. This makes you think back to when you were a kid, and you’d spend dry winter days inside building goliath castles and spaceships with Lego’s, each with precise and noticeable details. This wasn’t the kind of accomplishment you’d get prepackaged with directions and men. This was something that held no blueprint, and you had to recruit people to build it with you.   If you made a cross section chart of the bottles, you’d find Gatorade bottles on the bottom, from the childhood era, where we thought we were still capable of doing something great with our lives. Next you have the seventh and eighth grade, where we thought we were so rebellious and smart; you’ll find a few cheap beers. Work your way up to high school, and you have the experimental age, with hard liquor and a few broken shards of a shot glass. What you’ll find nine months from now is a bottle of vodka I polished off myself with a note inside.  An autograph from yours truly.  No Photos, please- I haven’t bathed in days.  Yes, I’m back on my feet. Or at least that’s what my agent’s told me to tell you.   Looking at the imaginary cross section, I see a bunch of paleontologists humping over each other, each trying to make the best hypothesis to who we were and where we came from. “Working your way from the bottom, one scientist observes, here, you can see the pillars of their ideology.” He continues on, “You can see a celebration here, he notes, where the tribe discovered faster, and more efficient methods of delivering the alcohol.”   Then he steps back, the way people step back from a car accident trying to find where the last chunk of the brain is, and end up spending all day trying to find it, because it makes more sense to look for pink goo then to go to work or school to make something out of your life.   Still confused and in much need of a nice, smooth snifter of brandy, he reaches the crust of the ancient tribe-civilization-thing and says “this must be where their holocaust happened.”   I snap to, and Philip is holding me up in the air, flaunting his untapped power that the drink gave him the keys too, holding all one hundred and thirty pounds of me, three feet in the air. Needless to say, he’s a lot bigger than me, and can hold a lot of liquor. Something I found out later that night, making a Taiwanese whore house out of Tom’s toilet. You’re the best man, thanks for letting me spend the night, I said in slur of barley audible English.    Nigga, he says, what da FUCK are you smokin? I tell him that I was looking for clues to the past- to now, the present. Even more confused and probably a little drunk, he tells me that it’d be best to shut the fuck up and do another line of blow with him.   We like talk ghetto because Tom brought up the point that we could yell racist slurs all day where we live and never fear getting in any sort of trouble because, honestly, there are no black people in suburbia. What a fun night that was with the two of them.   Tom has aviators on, and is on a barstool with his fly unbuttoned on his boxers and he’s pretending to bomb Hiroshima. This would be completely realistic if his dick wasn’t hanging out and I'm sure bomber chairs don't spin all the way around.   Maybe, you think, they were drunk. Maybe, you think, they were jerking off. You can only level a modern city and blow some sperm once in a lifetime.   Listening to the Boogie Nights soundtrack we go back to dancing and looking for relics to our parents past. Looking for their naked cross section of cumulative failure. I’m still looking for something to compare my problems too make them seem more distant and less personal.  Less of my problem.  Less me.  My life’s server jumps a little bit, and I whisper the word into my imaginary headset- LAG. This is in the middle of the last school year. This is like four or five months ago. I’m playing computer games, next to my sealed backpack, plugged in.   I’m afraid to leave the one place I have control of. I’m deadly afraid to become exposed and weak. When I’m in a game, on the top of a pile of rotting carcasses, I feel alive. When the steam from your minigun is scorching your face and the wind is blowing your wild sun-bleached hair in a thousand different directions, somebody might mistake you for a Norse god. I can almost hear the Valkyrie’s hymns from down here on a battlefield.   This isn’t me.  That’s what I love about it.  And I used to be a real kid, too.  My pants are still unzipped from the last time masturbated, which was hours ago. Mom would scream and flip out if she saw, but she gets home around six or seven every night now from somebody’s doctor or a quick stop at church. As if God has anything to offer anymore.  He used to be on the ball, right?  Download a few weeks before this; I replaced all the copies of my church’s bibles with copies of A Brief History of Time with my friend, Dylan. The church never even mentioned the incident, because even the pope himself might shrug once in a while and say yeah, our religion might not be the right one. We don’t have anything to offer more than the next guy, but we unified the west, so suck my cock. It’s an admirable organization, but I still want to lunge out at something.  An excuse.  Something to make my problems seem less personal.  Less real.  Less me.  And I used to be such a good kid.  It my basement, with me screaming at the headset half because my teammate just put a .45 in my head by accident, half because I banged my head on the desk trying to pull my pants up from my other addiction, half because I’ve hit bottom but don’t have the guts to admit it. I’m pulling up my pants not because I should work on my studies because I want to make something out of myself. I’m pulling them up because I can hear the pitter-patter of footsteps coming down the stairs to my two o’clock. This is my little cousin, and he’s twelve-years-old here.   I love this kid. He has this fascination with me. He looks up to me the same way I did to my old neighbor, Matt, when I was a kid. I modeled my style after my neighbor because at that point in time, I practically didn’t exist. I used to imagine more adventures then the ones I actually had with Matt.   Here is information evolution in the fifth gear. Music, fashion, sports, even what video game console to purchase is all dictated by this lost soul. This creature that takes over teenager’s lives and moves on to find another prey.    And here I am, trying to blame my problems on imaginary creatures. And I used to be such a good kid.   For Donald’s twelfth birthday, my uncle and I collected money from everyone in our family and built him a gaming computer anyone remotely familiar with PC’s would admire. For my gift, I got him a copy of Half-Life.    Why I did it, it was some vague example of brotherly love. Philadelphia. This is my life, and I want you to enjoy it too.    The real reason I bought him that game was another twisted soul to drag into my hole of a personality. This was the full circle of my neighbor’s life to mine to his. I was passing on the final driver for failure. Keeping the black torch’s flame alive and healthy.  “Healthy” seems like an oxymoron now.  Skipping the bumps on my life’s disk, I think back to the day I got my Saga Genesis. It’s Christmas Eve and I’m still reticent and naive. Matt showed up. Everyone loved Matt. I was in love with the fact one day I’d be like him.  And, to believe, I used to be my own person.  To send off the devil that’s been in his head since he first got it probably playing Atari somewhere, he came over to deliver his gift. His black flame.   Merry Christmas, little dude, he says. I see his red-haired girlfriend behind him smiling not out of love but probably the fact that they were going to go fuck and try to have their own kid that night. I look from the red and green package to his skinny but god like hand to his girlfriend’s white smile, and just from the weight of the box that I’ve felt a thousand times at his house, I know the story even before it starts.  All the plot twists.  How many pages are in each chapter.  The aspiring artist always gets killed.  I don’t fit into the victims, I see myself as more of an observer mainly because I still have a six pack of Guinness Draught in the mini-fridge I’ve been meaning to get to.  My family still has a few laughs about how quickly I pieced the surprise together. I ripped off the paper and then shot to my mom, pregnant with my damaged sister next to grandma, lighting up another cigarette. She nods to the basement door, and I’m down there in a flash.  About halfway down there, I run back to my neighbor, and hug his leg. Realizing years later that I probably smashed the poor guy’s balls in, I thank him. Thank you so much, I say. Thank you for everything. He’ll never know how much he gave to me.    I’ll never need another sugary treat or sports equipment for the rest of eternity. I’ll never have to wait at the DMV for four hours to get my Driver’s Licensee. I’ll never have to worry about college or school.   It’s kind of funny how our happiest moments reflect our worst.   It’s almost kind of cool how we put up this invisible security blanket of good memories in our moments of unhappiness or pain or near death. And yes, I’ve been to all of those places, and I’d thank god for the good memories that protect me from a bordering insanity if I weren’t so fucking pissed off at him.   Jump back to seeing my cousin, standing in my basement, trying to avoid looking at my undone pants and the wires wrapping around my body that stinks of whiskey, he asks me if I want to play some Counter-Strike tonight. Just a few rounds, he says. It’s already six or seven at night and I see him as more of a nine o’clock kid.    In the background you can hear a Terrorist blow my brains out, and that adds up to about my sixtieth death in that level alone. That’s how much I was playing. This is how much control I had of my life.   My cousin, looking incredibly timid like the way you look at a corpse or more like a corpse who’s under the heap of less white skin humping its rotting brains out. You’re first instinct is to simply turn around and ask the next person whose problems and addictions aren’t on the surface. Whose problems don’t include the following: alcoholism, sex addiction, bad grades, depleting social life, personal conflicts with God. I always imagined God as an awesome drinking buddy. I can imagine him hammered off his ass and telling me that the Missis and him got a little to frisky in Rio one night. One thing led to another and Humanity got blown out of some hot angel that god boned nine months later.   Sorry to disappoint you, God says stinking of red wine, but Earth is the sewers of the universe. Suburbia isn’t as bad, it’s like the storm drain, he tells me. Just shut up and try not to forget about me at the apocalypse, which is right around the corner.   My cousin, he says in his little whimper of a voice a lot like mine used to sound, asks if I want to play a little counter-strike that night. When I think of night, I’m thinking 1 am, because I like to play right after my midnight drink n jerk. He still goes to school everyday, I remind myself. He still has a life and a future and riches ahead of him, I remind myself. He’s still alive. I don’t want to ruin his life for him. It’s so much more fun to watch somebody do it to themselves. It’s the kind of laughter you get from watching a person willingly get shot out of a cannon or when people have heart attacks at eating contests.  He’s still alive the way I haven’t felt like that night at Tom’s in November.   I’m on my cell phone, typing out the words, I love you, to my girlfriend. Samantha. I still think of her every few nights. I remember her because she’s the one who dragged me into the hole I like to call hitting suburban bottom.   How she typed a message on a phone so quickly and articulately, she must have had it written out for a while. She was actually planning to dump me over a cell phone message. Jesus Fucking Christ that still gets to me. This is High School, I tell myself. We’re supposed to be adults. That’s the bullshit I’m fed everyday, anyway.   I start flipping out, and right away, I have my own plan stored in Tom’s cabinet. I hear Philip make some backhanded comment to Tom, and they play the I told you so game that they know has pissed me off since we were in the third grade.   My contingence of postponing my own pandemonium is in the bottle, the place the horror stories of broken families and great artists wrote about. I know all the passwords to all the doors without even having to ask for directions. I’m predestined to fuck up.   Tom and his Russian parents with their smooth Russian vodka, I pour everyone a shot. They think it’s kind of funny. I thought it was too.   Staring into the Vodka that I could have sworn was water, that I could have sworn would save me from my problems, how could I have known?  Jesus, isn’t this your job? Where is that fucking compassion? It would be great right about now.  Even now, every time I’m at a party, I like to take at least one shot of vodka, and every time I do, I can taste Samantha.   On my second shot of vodka, I taste the unity of Tom, Philip, and I, and how they’ll stick with me when I eventually tell them I’m a raging alcoholic. I still don’t think I am, but like I said, I can’t accept the fact that I have the biggest self-induced problem of anyone I know. I’ll get over it, eventually.   Third shot, I like to think of where my life is going.  Fourth, I like to forget.   Still though, I like to think that because of Sam, my life is a wreck. Sam’s headed towards Ivy League. No exaggeration. I’m dead sure of it. Everyone else is, too. She was smart and cute but most of all, she cared about my work and always comforted me when I needed it. Which I did, everyone does.   She used to make me feel smart by comparison.    As if I have anything real and valuable to contribute to the world.       As If amounting to something could solve anything.       It took her about two or three months to be able to brake up with me. It’s hard to brake up with a guy whose life is a hole of disappointment, I imagine.   Even with all the hospital visits and trips to flower shop for the small but elite group of sick people I know, I still get pissed off because she broke up with me over a fucking text message on a screen three inches big. I’m the most selfish one I could ever meet, or at least that’s what I was. I haven’t heard from Sam in nine months. I was the kind of nice kid who used to walk girls to their doors after every date, even if we fought.   For the past nine months, I haven’t lived. I’ve been in a comatose state. As soon as I was out of a bottle or pornography website or computer program, I feel back into another. I remember looking at clocks when my Mom would come home from her second job or the pharmacy, and thinking, Christ, where have the last five hours gone?   For the past nine months, I haven’t been out of a drink or x-rated movie or a round of counter-strike long enough to do any homework or study. I find myself relating to over-achievers in my school who haven’t slept enough because they were volunteering at the hospital, while I suck up their time and talent without a reason to live or progress or evolve. I used to help other kids study, that’s the kind of compassion I showed for my common man.   I haven’t gotten a mark on any test or report card for the past nine months higher then a “C.” I dropped a few courses and failed one, which is why I have to get up in four hours to get to summer school. This is before mom drives my sister to physical therapy. I used to help my sister with her exercises to help strengthen her demented muscles and twisted sprit, that’s the love I used to show for my sister.   Trapped in my self absorbent bubble of excuses and bad grades and drinking and sex addiction and video games, I stopped caring about anything.  That was the beauty of it.  I stopped living.  In a sense, I’ve been dead for the better half of the last year now.  I don’t care about the war, or which celebrity is having a fuckfest with a street bum. I don’t care about children’s rights, and I especially could give no shit about abortion either. The great part about being an addict and a waste is you stop worrying when the last time you got a haircut was or if you’ve worn the same pair of blue jeans for the past six days.   Stumble to last weekend, where you can find the three of us, Philip, Tom, and me, at it again. This is my problem that I’ve dragged them into. Thank the unfair God that it hasn’t gotten to them yet. They’re not taking hits during the day just to stay awake. Not yet, anyway, depending on how much we go though tonight.   This is the same routine we’ve been at for a very long time now. We’re drunk and Tom has a now half broken pair of aviators on and he’s bombing Nagasaki. He’s wearing white underwear , so his penis isn’t out and collecting gamma rays from any horrible weapon of mass destruction. I should go kick him off that damn chair if I was a little more coordinated.   Once Tom and Philip drank themselves to sleep, I take the Vodka bottle upstairs to Tom’s clean white kitchen, spilling some liquid failure every few inches. I find my way to a pen and paper next to his phone. I polish it off.   In cute little script, the word “Message” floats translucently above the rest of the bleach white pad. I write “I am abandoning my ties to anything remotely human. I am sick of searching for something to occupy my being. I am going to try and survive without my personality. If I don’t do something with my life and you’re reading this note, add it to your museum of natural history with the description of ‘suck my wasted life’s dick.’”   I don’t need Matt any more. Matt is probably on his second or third kid by now. He probably has a degree in something meaningful. His wife’s teeth are probably starting to shade yellow, and he probably loves her just as much or more.  He probably found God, somewhere.  Probably somewhere I haven’t looked because it doesn’t have a trail of shot glasses or pornography.  And maybe God isn’t so forgiving. Maybe he’s more of a teacher then a ruler. Maybe he’s trying to teach me how once you get the chance to brake up you’re life you have an excellent chance to rebuild it anyway you want. I write all of this on this little napkin-cocktail thing.   Maybe being an addict to so many things, God knew I’d eventually crash. Maybe he’s not out to judge us after all. God is just an observer. He’s watching the game on the television in the bar surrounded by the color white and a ton of fluffy things. Or maybe it’s something else. I’m writing this down in the early hours of sunlight. It must be around five or six.  Thank you for fucking up my life, God. Now that I don’t have Matt to follow blindly anymore. God’s horrible intervention has saved me from doing something boring and ordinary with my life. I could be way off on this one, I scribble as bits of saliva trickle off my lips, but maybe God being such a douche bag can inspire us to do great things.  I fold the note in half.  I write “Matt” on the front of the fold.  I roll him up like a SOS from the Spanish expansion.  I’m still pissed off at God, but not that pissed off anymore.  Wrapping the note and placing the genie in his bottle, I release him into his own mansion of numbness and into his own personal coma which will last until the day Tom’s pipes burst and the plumber finds a mountain of fossils. In this distant future I imagine, I can see the paleontologists over the note. I feel bad for the lives I might wreck, but that’s their problem.  That’s their chance to make something out of themselves other then a good salary and a Christmas bonus.   Jump to this afternoon, with my mom holding back the tears of one more problem that she needs to baby-sit. I sit her down. With Donald out of the room, I can finally breathe clear. Telling her everything, I know the creature that’s been jumping for generation after generation, to one troubled person to another, is dieing under the words of my revelation.    I shut the door and lock it, my mother staring at the giant Milky Way poster I have, she unfocused, and is able to look at the whole picture.    Mom, I say. I’m sick of consuming and destroying. I’m sick of watching people die and I’m sick of being one of them. The only thing I want to do now, I tell her, is to create and build and proliferate. Why I want to, it’s not because I owe society or God shit, it’s because of her. That because of her determination’s reflection to live, I want to mimic it- to fill the gap Matt left in me. I want to mimic her for at least the next decade, if she wouldn’t mind.    Mom begins to cry, and I bring her down to my chest, and I pat her and rub her back, telling her; thank you. Thank you for this mom. I love you, and I’m sorry.  Thank you.    That moment, that exact moment in time, I’ll never forget. Because, for the first time in nine months, I feel good. This is my rebirth. I’m no longer myself anymore, and I can feel the layers of personality and habits I used to know disappear under their own folds within my mind.    This is the first time in nine months where I can honestly say, that I’m a kid doing a good act. And maybe I’ll never really get a chance to build anything with my life, but sitting in the rubble of my wasted teenage years, I think,  I’m sure enough piled dust can still make an impression on the world.
