N having to wake up n go 2 sch again if not stay @ home dono do wad also. Haiz, there’s quite some dust in my room, n it is accumulating  fast. Tink of cleaning also tired of it liao. Well, currently now my fav. Past time is to either play com. Games or online game r do my 10-years series. Last wk I got e hook onto the maths 10 yrs series. Dono whether will I be doin the same 4 this coming Sunday? Tml is sec 3 marksmanship. N me will go 2 sch early to do some unit admin stuff. Haiz, smt tink of it y am I doin all this? With all those bloody sec4s haning around. I noe they don like us, B2000 and so r we to them. Onli noe how 2 suck up when the time comes. Still can rem the days when they r still cadets, as cadets they r already rather rebelious n vv attitude. Me take them when I was sec.3 f up wif them, damm assholes. But luckily, if I am not wrong, no sec 4s will be goin tml n so r Cis. Yeah~ Got sec.3 whose uniform even lost, n me hav to ask Edwin to bring his uniform down tml, n juz now he called me tt he cant find his uniform, so shafik got no uniform to wear tml lor I guess, unless miracle appears. Now in class, I prefer in sitting in e way I am not then compared sitting beside the TK Leong, who is either saying tings out of nowhere, relating to nth basically n tell his own tales out of sudden- like ‘hey, u noe my fren hor vv funny one, he… …’ if not things like ‘the British army las time/ now hav this tt this tt bla bla bla’. All abt military stuffs. If not toking, he will be @ dazed during lesson time, bitting his fingernails. N usually him n I broke out into quarrels due to all of his toking craps out of nowhere. He looked to me like a hypocrite 2 me, onli start to really befren to e person when he needs help frm tt part. Person. So like today I refuse to lent him my chem. File, wads e use of leanding him n he is not appreciating it? I still can rem las yr wad he said, ‘u nv treat me good b4’, bloody bastard. Despite of e tings I done 4 him, I has the guts to say tt. Lionel Q, this yr start to learn dono wad attacking skills, using stationarys like pens, compasses to behave e way like X-men, holding the pen by his fingers n juz swoop to cut thro e person’s throat. N this was taught by yulin. Lionel, also anti-sociall n dono how 2 control n manage himself well enough, I not saying tt I am act. Good, but in this case abt lionel, I really tink he is. Like during e visit to Metta Home, he reserved himself n does not go forward towards the pple ther. While we r preparing ourselves for songs, he stood one corner n I went over to bring him forward, n this time where is Alvin, if he really a fren of quek! Then @ the canteen area, juz nice during tt day of our visit was 2 person’s birthday, n we served the cakes to others, n lionel stood ther not doin anything, juz watching the rest of his classmates doin the job. When getting results @ sch, whenever he score badly, r pple force to c his marks even lionel was refusing, he would then sink in his chair, cross his arms n hav a angry look, reserving himself 4 abt 5-10 mins. Anyway, I really dono wad r e minds of these pple, but I am interested to find out, so if I manage to go to e U, I may wan to take up physo course if ther is one. As 4 my social circle, I hav a rather small r mini one, coz I tink I am not tt well-liked. Although I get along fine wif most of my classmates xcept pple like corny n tim, whose mouth is out of control one. I c them like maintain contact aft sch n hangout together, me? Juz tok 2 them in class times then aft sch, off we go on our own way. Ppple like Edwin, gone ITE now, I don really like him also, always giv the gangster tones… … Haiz, this world I hav a lot of unhappiness lor, n keeping all these 4 years while hoping tt I could share it wif someone. But juz 4 e sake of saying out, I type it out here. I still hav other unhappiness abt my life n feeling of unfairness,  n occasionally tink of dieing 2. Haiz… ….coz I believe die is a relief n not a crime lor, if suicide is not against e law, n everyone is doin it, isn’t tt gd in some sense? Beside reducing population n saving food prod. If there is a day 100% of humans in this world is to die, wont the earth be great!?! Having able to restore itself, reducing grennhouse effect? A earth wif no trouble n war?  N wad I wad I am moving myself by saying to myself I wan to noe my fate n how will my life be in e future, maybe by tt time I don even tink of e same way as I am tinking now!~~~
