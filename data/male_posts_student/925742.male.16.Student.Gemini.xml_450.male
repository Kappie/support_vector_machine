So its just slow.  In the sense where I must click more than twice and start typing to blog.  Eh, oh well.  Next up.... what the fuck I did tuesday through.... is today thursday?  I'm lacking on posts.  Its kinder to the you guys, if you neglect to read, you can catch up faster.  Anyway! Tuesday.... that would be... not a whole lot happened Tuesday, except that I redid my speech tape that night.  Let me tell you, a radiostation like slashdot would rule.   Thats what I did. Shut up, I'm a geek.  Oh, I also worked, but you know how work is, cleaning, vacuuming, walking, coldness, manual stuff.  So then Wednesday night I revised my debate and wrote it out.  And wrote some Chinese kanji to put on a kung fu shirt (printed out the transfer earlier tonight, ready to iron on).  I wasn't all too busy.    Today I ran 2 miles in PE because I wanted to.  I wonder if I could get slight annorexia nervosa, and then get over it.  It would prolly suck, since I would lose my muscle mass.  Eh, yeah that was a dumb thought.  Then in English I lost my police brutality debate by ONE VOTE.  Darnit, can't people realize its a big problem?  Oh well.  I reviewed in BIO and was king of the class once again in Algebra 4.  I am pretty good at math, I would say.  And it looks as if many of the teachers at school are on my side.    When I say that, I mean, that they favor me in class and such and have lotsa good things to say, so I might get on NHS.  Hansen was reminding me that its alright if I don't make it this year, and encouraged me to try filling my application out with more info and also what to put on it.  First time in a while he's encouraged me.  Not only him, but Mr. Forsee my bio teacher probably wants me to be as good as Sonja.  So he also praises me and lets me know about extra little things scholastically.  Interesting stuff.  My chemisty teacher is also quite cool to me, so it helps if you're smart and motivated like me!  I'm motivated to transfer my kung fu stuff onto my shirt.  I also modded up UT.  I do this like every month, since the game is still gorgeous.   New models, maps, and even a new beginning logo (now a hell fiend breaks throguh a cool ruined ancient logo deally).  I like UT so much. I'm fairly certain Phil Harm can't beat me.  Did I mention today that all that stuff at school I did today made me dirt tired?  I called in work and decided not to go.  I napped until like 7 and have been on the compy 386 ever since.  Not much else, I guess I'll go now.  I think that my blogs are lacking though.  As in, most people talk about deep stuff.  Well, ok, lets get deep, since I prolly won't post till saturday night.  Nick and I were talking last week about politics and stuff.  How Bush believes he can never do wrong, like he's God's chosen president, which pisses us off.  Every one of his actions is like divine, and he feels he'll get re elected.  How evil.  How he attacks doubt (abortion), and rights (patriot act, gay marriages).  And then for some reason we talked for 3 hours on space and time, it was FUCKED UP.  My brain hurt hella bad.  Guys, think about it.  Say, time machines are available in the future.  So your future self takes a stealth suit back to this time and puts it on your bed.  He leaves.  Ok, guys, this is happening instantaneously.  As in, he goes and comes back like he was never gone.  So you find a stealth suit.  Now, herein lies the main quandary.  If this was all instantaneous, as if he never left... now that you have the suit, is your future self altered, or do you grow into him and take the suit back with you again (when you become him) so that the process can repeat itself and nothing happens awry.  The second idea of thought (my own) means that such use of a time machine negates itself, since you grow into that person, destiny, that you will take the same action, so nothing is changing at all, really.  This means that time machine use is really useLESS since your future self will remember that he found a stealth suit on his bed when we was a teen, so he as to make sure that happens in the past so he can remain the same and so you can grow into him and nothing changes.  Therefore, really, the use of time machines, in the idea of destiny, alters nothing, as it was meant to happen that you use the machine.  You guys get what I mean?   But if time machines don't exist in the future, thought is wasted on this.  Now tease your brain with the idea that you have 2 machines in the future and leave one with your teenage self.  OUCH does your brain hurt now?  Nicks idea of thought about the stealth suit is that destiny isn't really destiny, so that things will take unexpected turns.  So taking back the stealth suit creates an alternate timeline in which your teenage self has the suit,  grows up, and is different from the original future self that brought the suit.  Get it? Imagine a road.  Someone changes the road and makes it fork.  Get it?  He contuues his way, in the hopes that a (better?) alternate timeline was created for an alternate self.  Now get it?  Just imagine the Trunks saga in Dragonball Z.  This is what Nick used as his example.  This idea is not without its merits either.  See, time is some cooky fucking shit, people.  Later.
