We could also reduce rubbish which are to be burnt or dumped . In this case , we could help reduce the amount of rubbish dumps in the country .         Before being recycled , rubbish were collected and taken to processing plants before being sorted out into glass , aluminium and paper . Waste glass were broken up first before being sent to the recycling plant to be made into new glass . Empty cans and used aluminium were sent to recycling plants to be melted down and made into new cans . As for used papers , they were broken down in chemical bath and bletched to remove ink in the recycling plant before being made into waste paper .
