Rich hall and Mike Wilmot were surprisingly good  "George bush said that this wasnt a religious war, it was "a crusade on terror".  idiot"  "Only the english could come up with a phrase like "surprisingly good" because you expect everything to be terrible all the time, so that when something is actually good, you genuinely are surprised"  but imagine someone saying the above lines so that they are funny and similar lines like them for 2 and a half hours and you can imagine how good it was.  bill bailey in June  woop
