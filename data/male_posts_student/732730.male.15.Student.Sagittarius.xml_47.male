I remember that Kieran told me to download ages ago, when we only just started talking on the phone.  Shittt.  I love Kieran, but I am so sick of his shit. So much so I've started losing all feelings for him. He's me me me all the time. And so hormonal, I guess. I wonder if it would be any different is he was here.
