Two things btw, it's 1:08 (1:28 as I reread this lol) in the morning as I type this, and in two days I have exams (of which I haven't studied for, but I always do reasonably well just by cramming), so excuse incorrect grammar or spelling (also, I'm at the point where I feel guilty for not studying and therefore am not doing anything productive, neither studying nor my hobbies, but spend my time by reading forums like  urlLink CGTalk  etc... [not nessacarily a waste if I think about it])   What really shocked me tonight was a story about two brothers, both into art. I was reading their  urlLink interview here  and absolutely loved some of their work. They're twins, and work closely together, and both go under the alias "Twincruiser". I was just imagining how great it would be to have a twin brother work with you, share your successes and happiness, talents and fun... (Just a note, I have no siblings, so I know little of the hair pulling and backstabbing normally associated with brothers and sisters =P )  This made me extremely shocked, when, going to  urlLink their website  to look at more of their work, I saw this...    To my dear, loving Brother    Why did it have to be so quickly...  You and I were destined to walk this life forever...  You knew that we could have done so much things together...  Still, In my heart I know you are here with me...  Thank you for the joy, inspiration and lessons you gave me...  You will always be with me, my brother.     His  twin  brother died only a month ago... I don't know the details, all I know is that it shocked me... I had a perfect image of paradise, two brothers working side by side together doing something they love, and then bang, it was all gone. The worst part was I was thinking to myself "Hey, they like mythology, this and that too, they sound like me!" and I felt I almost knew them... Bit of a shock eh?  Anyway, their artwork was and still will be excellent, they worked on many of the Warcraft manuals, and their work is stunning! Check it out if you have a chance.  Anyway, that's it for tonight, I'm going to be going to bed now since I really should get some sleep in preparation for exams (just another point, I  hate  the idea of sleeping, to me it's a waste of a perfectly good 8 or so hours which could be used for so many more things, and I also love the idea that people perform almost as well on 20 minutes of sleep [REM is the most important form of sleep and only occurs in the first 20 minutes]) Also, to note, if I was to be reincarnated, let me be a dolphin! They can rest each hemisphere of their brain seperately, thus never actually sleeping, only being awake in a dumbed down sense =P  The main problem though is that I suspect tomorrow I'll freak and spend hours and hours studying =) Got Latin up first, then Maths, then English, Geography (do History next term), Music, and finally Computing, which I won't have a problem in the world with =) I know that even if someone tested me at this very moment I would get in excess of 80% for every test (my brain works amazingly well without having to study, I actually find a lot of the stuff I learn interesting and as such stays in there) but I'd still love to get 90-95%... I studied about 2 or 3 days in advance very heavily in Year 7 (first time I had ever had exams, I was freaked) and because of that I became an Order of Merit student and subsequently got a 25% scholarship at my school (well over AU$10,000 a... quarter I think... not sure, ask my parents, they get the bill! =P ).  Anyway, here's for hope and a good nights sleep! =P
