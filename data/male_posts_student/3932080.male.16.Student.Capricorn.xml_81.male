Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink I Like That -Houston feat. Chingy, Nate Dogg, and I-20  Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #13  Earlier this year,  VH1  and  Blender Magazine  awarded the #29 spot on their  50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs…Ever  countdown to  Meat Loaf  for his 1993 #1 single from  Back into Hell , the sequel to  Bat out of Hell . Looking into the bubbly balladeer’s vague lyrics (“I would do anything for love, but I won’t do that”),  VH1  asked for the definition of the continually mentioned “that” and got no worthy answer. Eleven years later, it seems that this summer’s hottest rookie,  Houston , is rapping himself into the same dilemma with “I Like That,” a club anthem that, while unquestioning getting millions to sing along, offers no valid description for the overused pronoun. Detective listening provides only one hint: Whatever “that” is, it’s bouncing, banging, and hearty, evidence being the beat that fuses digital funk bass, synth trumpet calls,  3000-cool  organs, and techno bird whistles. But wait a second; In 2003, guest lyricist  Chingy  put out his first single, “Right Thurr,” which featured this chorus line: “I like the way you do   that   right thurr.” Dammit. It seems that post-2000 Southern rappers have a certain “that” which pleases them, all the while unbeknownst to the rest of the world (read: white people). Putting all those findings together, we define “that” as an action  Meat Loaf  will not perform but the current urban community loves. So whether you’re head-bobbing to “I Like That” because you know what “that” is or intently listening and awaiting the case-solving clue,  Houston  seems to have your ears perked, an act that even  Meat Loaf  would do.   The Verdict:  7.7/10 - The Fork   (3.85/5)     2004 Wild Card Singles Club Entry
