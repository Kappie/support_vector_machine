I borrowed wind waker from brian, so that is my current hobby of the moment, that and playoffs, both NBA and NHL, but ottawa is out! >.  There are two names that you must remember  Amplitude After Hours  went to senate with the amp gang, and brian sniffed sugar up his nose. im suprised that we were not kicked out. He was asking to look suspecious. But brian is cool n e ways.  We can play (completely, not just partially) Enter Sandman, For whom the bell tolls both by metallica, and Smells like teenage spirit by nirvana. Brian and evan also wrote a kick ass song.  as for After Hours, we alreay know what we want for an EP! marty is good at bass. Theres only one problem with this though...i can't play drums, but i guess i do alright when it comes to improvision.  we need a good mic amp or a PA system though, cause i can barely hear schultz when he sings.  good day, by the way
