Don't really care about that, I'm turning him evil during the wedding to spice things up. My teeth. I love them. I hate needles. I get the knock out juice through a needle. Not much else new, fourth o July was alright, saw some great fireworks but didn't get to send any of my own into the air, at least not that many. Went to a friends house and watched the Dorney Park ones go off, it was cool. I'll post some more to you loyalists later, probably after my teeth come out. Oh yeah, I can't eat or drink anything after midnight tonight. Later, peeps.
