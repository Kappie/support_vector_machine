It came with a 16 MB memory stick, but that's only good for 10 full res shots.  I want to get at least a 64 or 128 stick so I can take lots of high res shots.  Otherwise, I'd just use my dad's.  It's got a really nice battery and huge memory.  It's so bulky though.  I’m feeling pretty weird right now.  I’m not sure what it is.  Perhaps it’s my selection of music during the late hours of the night.  I remember the late nights of staying up just laying in my bed listeing to Miles Davis for hours.  "Blue in Green" and "Flamenco Sketches" on repeat all night long.  Just thinking for so long about the saddest of things.  I really don't know what I'm saying.  I just feel like that right now and I'm not sure why.  I'm really tired right now.  I'm going right to bed.  Good night.
