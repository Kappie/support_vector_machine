How am I going to pass if I do not read through and understand my lecture notes, textbooks, do a lot of exercises and ask my teachers if there is anything at all that I do not understand. Now i am staying back at school to finish up my homework. I feel that I will not do my homework were I to stay at home because at home there are so many fun things that I can do that I forget all about school. I only have a problem with mathematics. My teacher keeps pestering me to pass up my asignments. It is not because I am lazy or cannot be bothered, I just need more time to understand the concepts.
