Seeing the parents of the poor baby crying in sorrow over their sorry lost, makes me sad.. I really hope they will be strong, and im really sorry over their lost... Do support their website at  urlLink http://kids.linsean.com/  , help the kids out there... Please...  Working as a education trainer, i see a lot of healthy kids in front of me everyday, though i do not have any kids, but being a parent is really not simple at all. Most importantly our parents just wan us to grow up healthy, nothing else really matters.. Ya theres problems like, bad company and stuffs, but the most important point is health. We managed to grow up without any major health problems, please show care and concern for those unfortunate kids out there who are sick, some dont even get to live till 10 years old, dun even mention our age..   Parents out there, no matter how rebellious ur kid is, please be happy that they are healthy.. We as children of our parents should understand all the pains our parents went through to bring us up. When i was young, my parents were always worried about my asthmatic condition, having an asthma attack always had my parents on the edge.. And i now sincerely thanks my parents for their care and concern for me, now im guilty of the times when i quarrel with them and being rebellious. Going into ns really straighten all my tots, my parents are the ones there for me, when im in trouble in school.. Yes they hit me, they scold me, but if they didnt do so when i was young, i might not be the man i am now.. Thanks dad and mum, definitely appreciate what u did for me..   Please, take care of ur own health and be fillal, do not make our parents worry, they had suffered enough.. and to parents of baby jakob, im really sorry for ur painful lost, nothing else can replace him, but do try to bring another new life in. Baby jakob, ur pain is over now, do rest in peace...  Current mood: Guilty and sad Current music: None
