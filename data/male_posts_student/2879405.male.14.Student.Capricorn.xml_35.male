On saturday, 22-5-2004, i went to Ponggol Marina together with Eugene Gor Gor, his friend, Sophia, the sister, my brother and lastly another friend...? We rented a boat for Wakeboarding, which cost at least few hundred buckz, for about 3 hours. Well, to some pros, they may say that it is just some way to waste money buy hey, the 5 of us are new to this sport and i wouldn't dare to say im the best amoung them, and i can't say im the best!... aww its some shame to waste money right? Eugene's friend, being the best wakeboarder, demonstrated by being 1st.we all thought that it was some simple sport but it turned out the otherwise. So, sophia was the 1st beginner to try it out. She wasn't the worse but also wasn't the best, furthermore receiving 'bellay' lessons (better sense of balance)(how to spell bellay haR???)I went next, performing some funny falls that disappointed me and the boat load...
