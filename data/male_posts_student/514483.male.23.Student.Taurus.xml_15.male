First - Congrats to Beth and Jonathan on their lovely wedding, wish you both the best and many years of happiness.   Second - My wedding. Next summer - big party, casual, golf, beer. More details on the way. Also, once Nicole and I set a date, you can get all of the details at a site that I will be putting up here. Probably a subdomain.   Adios everyone, have a great day.
