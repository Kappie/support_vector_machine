Today was supposed to be the day of my first and only trial (unless we make it to nationals), given that I'm leaving for France on Monday.  But Dedham, our competitors, canceled because of the snow.  Now, both Matt Zimmer and I will have gotten roles but not participated in any trial- and I didn't even get kicked off my role!  At least I devised and revised the direct examination that will be used at trial.  I've had the same substitute like four times, Mr. Boris.  He's pretty cool, his mother is from the South so he says "y'all," he has a goatee, and he's only subbing for the cash, not because he wants to be a teacher.  In chemistry yesterday, he was going to let us out only ten minutes early, but I deftly negotiated for us to have the entireties of second AND third lunch, even on a long block with fifteen minutes between lunches.  All I had to do was my four raps, by Tupac, Biggie, and Chris Parnell, respectively.  I could tell everyone liked them.  Where the crap is Loren?  He doesn't seem to be here today, even though he was online just last night.  Maybe he has strep throat; he said that he has never missed school with a temperature lower than 102, and Ms. Heidlage said there's a lot of strep going around.  Oh, you know what?  He must have gotten an STD after being raped repeatedly by Sally.  That explains it.  Speaking of rape, a group was discussing statutory rape in history today (with Ms. Heidlage listening), and the following dialogue resulted:  Gabe: There are some countries where the age of consent is like, thirteen. Charlie: That's awesome!  When I told this to Ian and Matt in our chemistry-free today, we got into a bit of an argument about whether Ian looks at child porn.  Ian was like "I do not look at child porn!  Anyways..." and I mocked "I do not look at child porn!  Anyways, I was looking at child porn the other day, and..."  I also said that I would put the following misconstrued quote on my blog, and I'll stay true to my word: "I...look at child porn!" (the ellipsis replaces "don't")  I talked to the French guy online yesterday.  He seems OK, but he makes a bunch of mistakes.  Also, he talks in British English, not American English, saying stuff like "I hadn't the internet for a month."  Whadayagannado.  Will says I can't vote by proxy while in France, but he was a little ambiguous about it.  I might be able to.  France is just five days away...
