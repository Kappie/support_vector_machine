It obviously needs lots of revisions, but here's something to work from...      ------------------------------------------------------------------------      FADE IN:     “the new guy”    EXT. A BUILDING ON THE CAMPUS OF DEPAUL UNIVERSITY – EVENING    Students wearing backpacks are entering and leaving the building. Others congregate in small groups on the sidewalk outside.    CUT TO:    INT. A CLASSROOM – WIDE ANGLE    Ten to twelve students, ages ranging from 22-30 years (with one evidently older student, around 50) are talking quietly and appear to be waiting for the professor. Desks are set up in rows.    ANGLE ON SPENCER CODY    SPENCER, looking confident, is sitting next to a girl and they are engaged in conversation. SPENCER is emphatically waving his hands. A few surrounding students are obviously occupied and impressed by the conversation.    SPENCER  …and the guy was just laying there on the bench, with his legs up in the air and the bar pressed against his chest. So me and one of the other trainers run over…    ANGLE ON ERIC HOWARTH AND SARAH KELLEY    ERIC and SARAH, both well-dressed, are sitting next to each other. They each have everything in order – there is an open notebook and pen on each of their desks, as they sit with their arms crossed. They are arguing, but clearly trying to restrain themselves with whispers. They seem to be familiar with this, and it is implied that this happens often.    ERIC  I just don’t see whey every time your mother is in town for a weekend we have to drop every single thing we had planned –    SARAH  Eric, it’s just one weekend. And she hasn’t been here in two months.    ERIC  Well, I hope she doesn’t bring the dog again.    ANGLE ON DAWN FARMER    DAWN is sitting only one seat away from SPENCER, and seems to be entertained by his story even though she does not turn and look at him. PHIL WISZCLOWICZ, meanwhile, steps into DAWN’s row and begins to awkwardly slide in. He passes to the side of DAWN that SPENCER is not on, and seems to consider taking a seat directly next to DAWN. He nervously leaves a seat between them.    PHIL sits and begins to take out a notebook, textbook, and two pens. Appears to be thinking about how to say hello.    DAWN  Hey, Phil.    PHIL  Hey… Did you do the reading for today?    DAWN  Yeah, it was pretty interesting. I did it right before class, over in the café by the arts building.    PHIL  Oh, really? You know, I work in the library right next to there. Maybe on Thursday, I mean, if you’re going to be over there again, I could maybe –    SPENCER is leaning towards DAWN and passing a flyer to her. He takes her attention.    SPENCER  My band is playing Friday over at the Rebel’s Roost. The owner works out at Beefcake and so he’s a friend of mine. Drinks will be on the house. You should come by.    WIDER ANGLE ON CLASS    Now there are fifteen or so total students at desks. At least one student has his head down. The door opens, and everyone turns to look. It is the teacher, PROFESSOR WHITE.    ANOTHER ANGLE, FAVORING PROFESSOR WHITE.    PROFESSOR WHITE enters the room from the door at the back of the class. He walks down the row at the side of the room and sets a bag down on a table in front. As he walks in…    PROFESSOR WHITE  Well, I hope everyone had a nice weekend and found time to get through that chapter on finance.    PROFESSOR WHITE takes a book and some notes out of his bag. Looking at his notes, he glances up at everyone.    PROFESSOR WHITE  It looks like the first class must not have scared anyone away. Just about everyone seems to be have come back.    Just then the door at the back of class opens again. All heads turn. THE NEW GUY steps into the classroom and everything is silent. THE NEW GUY is dressed kind of 80’s cool – almost like something out of 21 Jumpstreet, with big hair and a flannel shirt.    ANGLE ON THE NEW GUY    PROFESSOR WHITE  You must be –    THE NEW GUY  Yeah. The new guy.    There are whispers from all over the classroom.    GIRL #1 (whispering)  He’s so cute.    GIRL #2 (whispering)  Where’d he come from?    GIRL #3 (whispering)  I don’t know, but he’s gorgeous.    PROFESSOR WHITE  You can just have a seat where you’d like.    Girls all over the classroom scramble to take backpacks and books out of the chairs next to them. They sit up straight and turn towards THE NEW GUY and smile.    THE NEW GUY  Thanks, dude.    BOY #1 (whispering)  He just called the professor “dude.”    BOY #2 (whispering)  That’s so cool.    THE NEW GUY finds a seat by himself towards the back of the class. SARAH, in the meantime, has pulled out a small mirror and his checking herself out in it. ERIC notices and makes a disgusted face.    OVER THE SHOULDER SHOT OF THE CLASSROOM (from WHITE’s p.o.v.)    PROFESSOR WHITE  Ok, where were we? Yes, finance.    ANGLE ON PROFESSOR WHITE    PROFESSOR WHITE turns towards the chalkboard behind him.    PROFESSOR WHITE  When the tax base is multiplied by the tax rate we have what will be called the total yield…    FADE OUT    FADE IN:    PROFESSOR WHITE is again at the board, and is facing the class.    PROFESSOR WHITE  And those, then, are the formulas through which state sales tax is typically derived. On that note, let’s take a ten minute break. And don’t forget about the quiz you’ll have at the end of class – all on information from today’s lesson.    WIDER ANGLE ON CLASS    Most students make some noise closing their books, standing up, and moving towards the door. There is chatter as everyone leaves.    CUT TO:    …DAWN, PHIL, SPENCER, ERIC, and SARAH standing together as THE NEW GUY walks by them.    PHIL  So who is that guy, anyways?    DAWN  I don’t know, but there’s something really different about him…    GIRL #1 walks up.    GIRL #1  I heard he’s been bouncing around different graduate school programs for years – a real drifter, you know? He started off of in education, then he was in art history. After that was in law school for a while, and now he’s in public policy with us.    SPENCER and ERIC both make confused faces. BOY #1 walks up to the group.    BOY #1  I heard his parents died in a car accident when he was 6, and that he went from foster home to foster home until graduating high school.    DAWN and SARAH are both visibly impressed.    PHIL  Wait, how do you know all this?    GIRL #2, now with the group.  Remember that law professor that died a couple of years back? I heard it had something to do with THE NEW GUY!    GIRL #1  Shhhh! Here he comes.    THE NEW GUY walks back down the hall and chooses a spot about five feet away to lean against. He is leaning with his back to the wall, one knee bent, with that foot flat against the wall. He leans his head back and runs his fingers through his hair. GIRL #1 gets the courage to go talk to him.    GIRL #1  So, are you new to the school?    THE NEW GUY  Look… thanks for trying to be nice, but can’t you see I’m a drifter? You shouldn’t fall for me… I’m a loner. Do you know what that means?    By now everyone in the hallway is watching.    GIRL #1  But maybe we could make it work…    THE NEW GUY  That’s just it… it can’t work.    ERIC  Hey, everybody, I think our break is up. We should get back to the room.    Everyone quietly moves back towards the classroom.    CUT TO:    …the classroom, with PROFESSOR WHITE at the front, discussing taxes.    PROFESSOR WHITE  For the past forty years, there have been significant changes in the tax revenues raised by different governmental levels. Total tax revenues for all levels of government have more than doubled in each of the decades between 1950 and 2000…    Suddenly, a cell phone rings. It’s THE NEW GUY’s phone, and instead of a really cool ring tone it is a very nerdy one. Everyone quiets and looks at him.    THE NEW GUY (in a cool, confident voice)  Oh… sorry.    GIRL #1  Did you hear that? The new guy didn’t turn his cell phone off!    GIRL #2  Yeah. Isn’t he amazing?    PROFESSOR WHITE continues talking  Tax revenues have increased by over half a trillion dollars in the past forty years. This reflects overall governmental growth during that period. In addition, nominal state government revenues have increased at a faster rate than revenues for either the federal or local governments, rising by over 3600 percent in the last forty years…    As PROFESSOR WHITE talks…    GIRL #2, sitting right in front of SPENCER, gets up to go to the restroom.    DAWN is doodling in her notebook.    INSERT: DAWN’S hand is writing in a notebook. She is drawing a heart, with the words “ME + NEW GUY” written in it.    ANGLE ON SARAH.    SARAH is sitting with her hand on her chin, staring at THE NEW GUY. ERIC notices and bumps her with his elbow. ERIC is noticeably disappointed.    ANGLE ON DAWN.    INSERT: DAWN is writing again. This time she is signing her name over and over: “Mrs. Dawn New Guy, Mrs. Dawn New Guy, Mrs. Dawn New Guy”    PROFESSOR WHITE  Yes, a question?    THE NEW GUY  Tax structures have clearly been changing quite a bit over the years. Wouldn’t it make sense for governments to create stability in the tax structure so that the business community and households could make decisions in a more stable fiscal environment?    The class turns and watches THE NEW GUY as he says this. There is quiet for a few seconds.    PHIL  Yeah, the new guy is right. Not only could better decisions be made, but government could function more efficiently because its revenue wouldn’t be as variable.    Everyone slowly turns to look back at PROFESSOR WHITE, who pauses before speaking.    PROFESSOR WHITE  You’re exactly right. And your intuitive question serves as a perfect segue into our next topic: the political and economic motivations for changing tax structures in the first place.    ANGLE ON PHIL, WITH THE NEW GUY OUT OF FOCUS IN THE BACKGROUND    PHIL turns to look back at the new guy. He stares for a second, and then nods.    FOCUS ON THE GUY    THE NEW GUY waits a second, and then nods back. He holds the stare, and then looks back towards PROFESSOR WHITE.    ANGLE ON GIRL #2, who is returning from the restroom.    GIRL #2 takes her seat in front of SPENCER. As she leans forward to take notes, the top band of her underwear is showing. “THE NEW GUY” is freshly written in sharpie.    ANGLE ON SPENCER.    SPENCER mouths “what the fuck.” He turns towards ERIC, who has also noticed.    SPENCER  Did she just do that in the bathroom? This is starting to get ridiculous.    CUT TO:    …a shot of the classroom from the front. Music comes on, signaling the beginning of a montage. The following clips short clips are included:    · THE NEW GUY has his hand up. PROFESSOR WHITE can be heard prompting him, “Yes?”  · THE NEW GUY SAYS “but you’ve got to remember that for any individual family unit the ultimate impact of taxes is the sum of not only state and federal but also local.”  · ANGLE ON PHIL, who is smiling and nodding approvingly.    · BOY #2 says, “but different levels of government collect different taxes with different efficiencies.”  · PHIL follows with, “Which is why the US has a system of intergovernmental transfers.”  · THE NEW GUY finishes, “…Used by states and the fed to provide incentives for local taxing jurisdictions.”  · PROFESSOR WHITE smiles and nods his head, saying “Once again, you’re all exactly right.”  · The three students beam at one another.    · PROFESSOR WHITE asks, “So then what, exactly, would an economist consider the ‘best’ kind of tax?”  · GIRL #1 says, “Well, it would have to have a broad base…”  · SARAH continues, “And a low tax rate…”  · THE NEW GUY, “And consume a larger portion of wealthy individuals’ incomes than of poor individuals’ incomes, making it…”  · Everyone at once, “A progressive tax.”  · All in slow-motion à PROFESSOR WHITE pumps his fist a couple of times and points at THE NEW GUY. THE NEW GUY, in turn, points at PHIL, who is pointing back. The montage ends as the song is cut.    PROFESSOR WHITE  Alright, let’s take the last break. You’ve got ten minutes. We’ll take the quiz when you get back.    WIDER ANGLE, again, as the students get up to take their break.    CUT TO:    the hallway.    The students are again loosely huddled around one another, but this time THE NEW GUY is part of the group. SPENCER walks up, and taps THE NEW GUY on the shoulder.    SPENCER  Can I talk to you for a second?    THE NEW GUY  Sure. What’s up?    SPENCER  Listen, maybe you don’t understand how it works around here, but no one just waltzes into one of these classrooms and takes over. I don’t know what you’re trying to prove, buddy, but it ain’t workin’. Around here we work hard and we play hard, and one thing we don’t do is bow down to any old new guy who walks through those doors.    THE NEW GUY  (Pauses for a few seconds, confused.) What are you talking about?    SPENCER  I don’t know, I guess I got kind of off track. But just watch it, okay?    THE NEW GUY says nothing, but stands there as SPENCER walks back to the group. SPENCER pulls some folded up sheets of paper from his back pocket, and begins distributing them to everyone. PHIL does not take one. Neither does DAWN.    SPENCER  So remember that buddy of mine I told you about who took this class last semester?    ERIC  The one from Beefcake?    SPENCER  Yeah. Well, he’s got copies of all the quizzes. Here’s the one we’re taking tonight. Take a look. It’s everything we’ve been talking about today.    BOY #1  Wow, thanks Spence.    GIRL #2  Yeah, this is great. Thanks.    ANGLE ON SPENCER    As everyone thanks him and gets a few pats on the back, he smiles and turns to THE NEW GUY. THE NEW GUY just shakes his head and slowly walks back into the classroom.    CUT TO:    …the classroom, where PROFESSOR WHITE is about to hand out the quiz.    PROFESSOR WHITE (handing out the papers)  You have fifteen minutes to finish.    PROFESSOR WHITE begins walking around the room and giving every student a quiz. As ERIC gets his, he smiles and looks at SPENCER. The two nod to one another, and everyone begins writing.    CUT TO:    …a few minutes later. Everyone continues to write, and PROFESSOR WHITE slowly walks around the room.    CUT TO:    …everyone sitting at their desk quietly, with nothing in front of them. GIRL #1 finishes her quiz and walks it up to PROFESSOR WHITE.    ANGLE ON PROFESSOR WHITE    PROFESSOR WHITE  Well, that’s the last quiz. Don’t forget to read chapters 3 and 4 before Thursday’s class. I’ll see you then.    WIDER ANGLE of the entire class. Everyone puts their things into various backpacks and bags and makes their way towards the door.    CUT TO:    …the hallway.    In a couple groups, everyone is making their way down the hall when PROFESSOR WHITE shouts down the hallway.    PROFESSOR WHITE  Everyone stop.    PHIL  What is it?    PROFESSOR WHITE  Whose is this?    PROFESSOR WHITE holds up a copy of the quizzes that SPENCER was passing out during the break. Everyone is now crowded around PROFESSOR WHITE. No one is saying anything.    PROFESSOR WHITE  This is a copy of the quiz. Someone has cheated on this quiz, and I want to know who it is. If no one takes responsibility for this, then everyone will have a 0%.    Again, there is silence. No one is admitting to it… and then THE NEW GUY pushes his way to the front of the group.    THE NEW GUY  It’s mine. I did it.    Everyone is shocked, but no one says anything.    ANGLE ON SPENCER    SPENCER just stands there, clearly shocked. He says nothing. PHIL, in the meantime, looks like he wants to say something but is quiet. He just looks between THE NEW GUY and SPENCER.    PROFESSOR WHITE  Well, I’m extremely disappointed. You do understand you’ll be expelled from the program? School policy.    THE NEW GUY  Yeah.    PROFESSOR WHITE shakes his head and walks back into the classroom. In the meantime, THE NEW GUY says nothing. As he begins to walk, the group parts at creates a path for him. Everyone quietly watches as he walks away. Just before he gets to the door, SPENCER speaks.    SPENCER  Hey, new guy – Why’d you say you did it?    THE NEW GUY stops and turns sideways, with his head facing the group. SPENCER is now standing at the head of the group, so that he is closest to the new guy. PHIL is just behind SPENCER, with a desperate look on his face. THE NEW GUY waits a few seconds.    THE NEW GUY  For the first time, I felt like I was part of a family. You accepted me into you hearts, and it meant something… That’s why I did it.    Silence. After a few seconds, THE NEW GUY’s phone begins to ring. He answers it.    THE NEW GUY (into his phone)  Hey, what’s up dude.    Slowly, he turns and walks. He pushes his way through a door and is gone.    ANGLE ON the group.    SPENCER is nodding, finally with approval. ERIC and SARAH stand next to each other, holding hands. PHIL stares off into the distance.    CLOSE UP on DAWN’s face.    A tear rolls down DAWN’s face.    FADE OUT.
