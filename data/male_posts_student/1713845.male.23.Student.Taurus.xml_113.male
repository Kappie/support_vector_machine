She couldn't even get Petey, the one legged, black quadrapalegic from down the hall to throw her a mercy fuck...She had to jerk him off into a cup and insert his man sauce with a turkey baster.  Looking at how quickly you've grown up it's safe to say the apple doesn't seem to fall far from the tree, you malignant little whore.  Drink A.I.D.S. and Die, The Diva
