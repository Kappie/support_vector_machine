James is starting to get on my nerves again also, I hate to say.  If it's not secret codes he flaunts, its the PoD or Netstat as a 'hacking' method (god help us all).  Trinity never got anywhere by scanning her Network!  The hard attitude especially pisses me off, I don't think I'm alone on that...  We had the first exam today.  Pure geographical shit, nicely sectioned out into high-mark answers... lovely!  The teachers marched up and down the desks like military people (topped off by Mr. Rock at the top of the hall with a 'corporal' look about him).  I think I did quite well, which bugs me because I hate doing well in things I'm not good at.  I GOT AN A IN THE BIOLOGY MODULAR EXAM WOOOOOO HOOOOOO!  I love doing well in things I'm good at!  Aparantly 2 comets are in the sky on Saturday morning, can't wait to stay up really early to see those!  (By the way, you may have noticed swearing in my blog today!  Before you complain... "It's my blog and I'll bitch if I want to!" Mwahaha)
