Seriously, though, I'm trying not to delve into Iraq too much at the moment because I'm having trouble balancing the need to respect the lives of people (of   all   nationalities) in harm's way over there against the need to recognize that the events of the past year are of greater historical magnitude than most of us are noticing right now.  Forest?  Trees?  Which to comment on?  Answers to this question only become clear during landmark events or mysteriously crystallizing moments.  But Bremer's exit strikes me as neither.
