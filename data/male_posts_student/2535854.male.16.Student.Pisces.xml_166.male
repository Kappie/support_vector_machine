The sidebar seems to show on the side it should..but...it shows up uder all the entries!WTF?!?But...for certain months under the archives and stuff and viewing most entries on its own special page,the sidebar and its contents show up obidiently where it should!Wierd.    That fucking dumb  urlLink Haloscan , is now my  old   commenting system now...I got fed up with it deleting all my old comments and stuff despite the fact that on other blogs they still saved and showed like tons of comments and also  OLD  one`s as well.Fuckers.     Ish..now I have to create a links and tagboard section.Grrr.     Oh screw everything.
