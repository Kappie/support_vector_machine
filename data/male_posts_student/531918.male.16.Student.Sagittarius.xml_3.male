They sure like their sausage. - For every one can of (Sam's Club) cola there was, there were ten cans of beer.  A large assortment of beer, too.  I witnessed cans of Molson Canadian, Labatt Blue, Bud Light, and Miller Lite being devoured. - Nobody brought a gift for the graduate.  That answers my question for the Saturday after next. - We played a lot of country music and classic rock, including all ten and a half minutes of "Free Bird", all eight and a half minutes of "Paradise by the Dashboard Light", all eight minutes of "Stairway to Heaven", etc. - We had to play overtime, so the job got extended to six hours.  However, I got paid $50.  If only I could get some new CDs before I leave next week.  I have my eyes set on Muse, The Killers, Velvet Revolver, etc.
