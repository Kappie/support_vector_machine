Now, I don't want to call this a vile tactic to take some of the post-DNC press coverage away from John Kerry, but that is what it was. To raise the so-called "terror level" to a ominous orange over intelligence that predated 9/11 is ludicrous. This isn't the first time in recent memory that the Bush administration has been playing politics either. They instructed the Pakistani government that from July 28-30 would be the best time to announce the capture of a terror suspect, even though he had been captured a week earlier. Oddly enough, those dates seem to coincide with the Democratic National Convention.  I think we are all sick of living in a culture of fear. I know that terroristic threats and information have to be taken seriously, especially in this post-9/11 world, but I also believe that the capabilities of terrorists have been grossly overstated. Think about it: even though the Bush administration has waged a horribly ineffective War of Terror, they have made it a top issue that many more countries and people seriously pursue. We now think about terrorism in every aspect of our lives. Chances are, we won't be caught with our pants down again. Truth of the matter is, many of these "terror alerts" are designed to keep Americans afraid. When we are afraid, we won't look too closely at what the government instructs, and we will readily give up some of our civil liberties in the name of "freedom."  We aren't safer than we were four years ago. George has fostered so much ill-will in the Islamic world that every day, more jihadis plot to destroy us. Attacking Iraq sure hasn't helped us out in the Middle East, and neither will attacking Syria or Iran. We need to work together, and become part of the global community again. We need to show the world that we aren't all arrogant oilmen who are unilaterally committed to the dollar.  It is time to try some compassion, damnit. We've tried things his way, and now it is proven that "Shock and Awe" is not good foreign policy.  I am thinking about submitting this as an Open Forum letter to the  Dispatch , and I'd like your input. It has to be under 300 words, so I'd probably have to cut some things out of it. Please look for spelling and grammar mistakes, also. Thank you.  In other news: Work today. It went by pretty fast, and my grandma gave me an office chair that is much more comfortable than my old chair. I got paid, bought some gas, and now, here I am.   Today it was pleasantly cool, and tomorrow I hope it is sunny out so I can go swimming.  Me and John are thinking about going in halfsies on a FM transmitter with a mile radius, so we could start a radio station off our iPods at the high school. We could take requests and whatnot, and having a pirate radio station has always been a dream of mine. You know, sticking it to the man and whatnot.   Speaking of John... he got into a funny fight with his brother today. He demanded money to pick Mike up, and Mike threw his shoe at him. John drove away, but turned around for a while. As he was turning around to pick Mike up, Mike called and told him to "suck on his nuts." Now, while that is quite disgusting, John broke the code by telling his mother. You  never  tell on a sibling, unless it is something that won't get them in trouble. I am a devout follower of the code, and although Bailey has done some scummy things to me in the past, I never told Mom (Unless I was trying to cause trouble over something small).  Well, I am going to play my guitar and enjoy the night air.  Until tomorrow.
