I wasn't shocked by the results as I noe most ppl dun actually noe much about me. So far, out of 22 ppl who haf taken the quiz, onli 8 of them passed. L0L! Some results proved to be realli surprising. Haha, so let's look into it. We'll start frm the bottom.  I seriously didn't expect any1 to get 0, but maybe my questions were realli too personal. L0L. There were 2 tt got 10, 1 of them is Benson, who I feel like smacking! I've been in the same cls wif him for the second yr and he doesn't noe me!!! Grrr! L0L! I wasn't shocked tt 3 ladies got 20 cus honestly, they do not noe much bout' me, so it wasn't disappointing. 5 ppl got 30 and nope, wasn't shocking either cuz they didn't noe much about me too. I was disappointed wif 2 out of 3 ppl who obtained 40. I felt tt they knew me pretty well compared to others and the minimum they shld haf got was 50, but it's ok, sometimes things liddat happen. No worries ya?  Now for those who passed the quiz. L0L! There were 4 ppl who got 50. It was pretty surprising to see who were the ones tt got 50 cuz I wasn't expecting any of these 4 ppl to get 50. There were 2 tt got 60 and I'm pretty happy wif them. L0L! I didn't realli expect them to get tt high cuz I always thought of them as those kind of "heck care" ppl. L0L! Only 1 got 70, tt was the most surprising result of all as I didn't expect tt person to get sucha high mark although he knew me pretty well. L0L! There were no 80s or 90s, but some1 someway and somehow managed to get a 100! OMG! Well, surprised? Yea, a lil' bit. Expected? Well, I kindda hope so. Happy? Definitely I was. L0L! And who on earth would actually get full marks for it? Some1 u least expected it to be! L0L! Maybe not. Some1(Anonymous) managed to guess who it was.

Me: Haha ok  Hmmm, I thought about wad tt person said and well yea, it's kindda true. I mean it's not easy to find some1 tt knows so much about u rite? So I'm pretty glad about it. Well, I guess I'll stop here for today. I'll provide more results when others take the quiz ya? Alrite den, cya~! =]
