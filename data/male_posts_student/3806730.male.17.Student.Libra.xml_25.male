We all met at the Youth Jam, the weekly Midweek Service, held on Wednesdays and Thursdays. The Word was about running the Christian race - running it well and ending up being a winner.  It was all about DETERMINATION, DIRECTION, DISCIPLINE.  Determination to run and finish the race well, direction to tell you which way to go so you don't go about your life aimlessly, and discipline to get you to do things right away and excellently.  What struck me the most was what the pastor quoted, frm Helen Keller:          The greatest tragedy in life is people who have sight but no vision.    Helen said that when she was asked what could be worse than being born blind.  Can you imagine that.. It made me look at myself and really think, do I have purpose? Am I living my life in such a way that when I look back, I'll really have no regrets?  I'm working on it :)
