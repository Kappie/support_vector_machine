Ashley makes damn good chicken melts, for whatever it's worth.  Anyway, I am usually a relatively good bowler.  I have bowled a 175 once, in fact.  It is one of the few "sports" I am actually good at.  So the first game I bowled a 37, which kind of pissed me off, but we were all laughing at each other so it was fun.  Second game I got a 72 and the last time I got a 118.  118...hmmm, that sounds like my golf scores.  Anyway, when we came out of the bowling alley, there were ambulances, police cars, fire trucks etc., going down Ronald Reagan toward Lilburn.  We started home and got to the Web Gin House exit and there was about a 10 car pileup on the other side of the road, I guess do to dumbass drivers added to rain.  Now if it wasn't for dumbass drivers, my dad wouldn't have a job, but this was a really bad wreck and somebody died in it.  Anyway, we got back to Britt's house and watched Secret Window with Johnny Depp in it.  Hell of a movie.  I don't like Johnny Depp's political views, but the guy can act.  If you want a movie to watch because you're bored, I highly suggest Secret Window.  It's like 3 hours long too.  So now I'm at home and I guess I'll be here the rest of the night doing nothing at all.  God I love summer.
