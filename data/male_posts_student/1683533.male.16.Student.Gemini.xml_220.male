So, I started listening to them again, and I forgot how fun they were.  It will be cool to see them live.  Grandma's b-day party was alrite.  There are a shitload of new babies.  The next generation of the Schultz Family is upon us! O_O  besides that life's been dull...tomorrow work...nothing thursday i think...friday work...gah...
