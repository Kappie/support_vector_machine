Evidence:   (1) Comcast's email-server seems to have died, or I've screwed up my computer and killed Outlook.    (2) The javascript on my blog isn't working    (3) I have to take Health over the summer      Wait , you say,  health class doesn't have anything to do with technology!     Oh, but how wrong you are. If we lived in a society where technology had advanced to the point where either [a] there would be no need to teach everyone all this silliness about disease, death, and how to avoid it or [b, the  better  alternative] technology made everyone smart enough to render such classes  obsolete . So, grrrrrr.      I hate Faulkner. Hate hate hate hate. Maybe I'll grow to like him, but this has yet to happen. But, at least I've started. I will   NOT   repeat last year,   under any circumstances . So, yay, I suppose.     Driving class tomorrow, 1-3. Stay off the roads, I'll be reading HP5 at the same time.   39 minutes left!     Yayfor centerage.  Peace out.
