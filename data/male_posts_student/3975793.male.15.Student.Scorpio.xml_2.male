Both her and I proffessed each others love for one another. I literally hit the floor in happiness. Its one of those things where, you've been wanting to say something for years, and you finally say it. *Breathe in* ahh... I feel like screaming again, but i wont because i just remembered what happened last time. Anyway, This Blog is more or less to talk about my upcoming CD. It's not a story of my day or anything, but, what the hell.     ~*~ ~*~ ~*~     I love the little wavy guys. Anyway, My new CD "It's all Black and White to Me" is an all acoustic version of all my songs. I'm workin my way up to getting 12 or 13. so far I have 4 and in the process of writing another. I think they are comming out very nicely, i've got a preview of the album right here:
