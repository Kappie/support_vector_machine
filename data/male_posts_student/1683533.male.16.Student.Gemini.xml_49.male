My economic plan is based upon this word: jobs. I want to ask that question all around the country, what do we do to create work? There's a lot of good people who want to work, and we've got to help them find work. And so I'm asking Congress, when they come back, to keep in mind one word: jobs." President George W. Bush, January 28, 2002  So...you are thinkin...oh he must be true to his word...I bet millions of more people have jobs thanks to George Bush... WRONG!! ...In January 2001 about .7 million people were long-term unemployed...around the time Bush was put in office...what is the number of long-term unemployed americans now? Almost 2 million....that is more than double since Bush started!!! DAMN! man... BUSH SURE STICKS TO HIS WORD.... .... yea and I got pigs flying out of my asshole...   Not only that but stocks are plummeting and consumer confidence is on the downfall...I got this info from  urlLink here ....  What about these tax cuts he is making? how much are we gonna save? The White House says that the average American will receive $1,083 under President Bush's 2004 Re-election Tax Scheme.  The reality? The vast majority of Americans won't get nearly that much. Here's what the Bush tax scheme really looks like: *20 percent of the americans have an income of 0-16,00...they will save only about 6 dollars...practically nothing *20 percent of the amercians have an income of 16,000 to 29,000 dollars...they will save about 99 dollars *another 20 percent has an income of 29,000 to 46,000 dollars...they will save about 289 dollars *and another 20% has an income of 46,000 to 79,000 dollars...their tax cut will be about 657 dollars *15 percent of americans have an income of 77,000 to 154,000 they will save 1,841 dollars...ok...so we finally reached around where bush said we would save... *4% of americans have an income of 154,000 to 374,000...they will save a  3,542 dollars *1 percent makes more than 374,000...their tax cut will be a whopping 30,127  so...only about 20% of the americans will be getting as much as or more than Bush promised....does 20% seem like the average american....no...we are talking upper class people...rich people...not the average american...so...how much will Bush save on his own plan? Bush would save  $16,511 ....and Vice President Cheney? His tax cut is a whopping  $104,823  on Bush's tax scheme....so is Bush's tax scheme for the average american or for  himself ?   So how is this effecting michigan...I would like to thank democrats.org for supplying me with this info...and all the other info...:   59,700   Michigan workers who have lost jobs since Bush took office    128,500   Michigan workers in danger of losing unemployment benefits    $7.6 billion   401(k) benefits lost by Michigan workers    $116 million   Lost in the Michigan state pension funds due to corporate scandals    10.4   The percentage of Michigan's population currently without health insurance     besides in michigan, Bush has presided over a 94 percent decline in the federal budget surplus -- that's $5.3 trillion gone in less than 2 years.  If you live in a different state then Michigan feel free to find out how Bush screwed your state up the ass by clicking  urlLink here ....this is all a sample you can find in Democrats.org....there is so much info against Bush on that site...I can only give you a handful of info....I would love to type more...but I am far to lazy...why don't you just go there yourself...
