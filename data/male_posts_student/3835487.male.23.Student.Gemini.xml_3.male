On the fourth I had a cookout with Smith and Kristin. We swam and then watched the amazing Waco fireworks. Actually, they were over thirty minutes long this year, which turned out to be a bad thing. I used to complain that they were too short. After thirty minutes of the same firework over and over it gets pretty boring. I'd say 18 minutes is an optimal firework display time.  Today I saw the movie  King Arthur . It did not get the best reviews, but I really enjoyed it. The reviewers claim that the film lacks emotion, but I guess reviewers today require cheesey or over-the-top emotion in their films, because this film had a good amount of emotion. Just because somebody wasn't yelling "FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDOM" at the end doesn't mean something lacks emotion. Word.  tomorrow I must go to class. I don't actually know if the professor will be there. Hopefully she will not. She has been off in the Ukraine and has yet to return. Oh well.   Ma$e has returned to the rap game! But this time he's sober. That translates into bad rap music. It's a requisite that rappers smoke weed. It's not my personal choice but if they ain't doin' it, I'm not listening.   I have decided that going out to bars sucks now. Especially in Waco. I think I've lost a lot of interest in drinking, it's never fun when I go out to bars. Especially when you see the same lame Waco people over and over again. Perhaps I am growing up. I'd rather just relax or hang out with friends. I don't need no alcohol to get my kicks.   That's all for now. Holla.   Alex
