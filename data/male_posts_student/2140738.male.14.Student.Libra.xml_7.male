So I went up to the house and found out that my step-grandfather owns it (but in reality he lives in Costa Rica). I went inside and it looked like he was having a party, it was crammed with people. Eventually I made my way into a huge room, that was lowered in the middle. Around the outside of the lower part there were tables lined with food. It also seemed that most of the people there were spanish. So I wandered around the house for a bit and met up with my parents and by that time it was night. Well at some point in the night, I was sitting at a table in front of everyone and other people were sitting at the table too. I remember I was in between these guys from school, Mitchell and Jordan. By my legs were their bass guitars (since they play bass and electric in a band). After a while, Mitchell stood up and played a solo. I don't know why, but I reached down, picked up Jordan's bass and started plucking on it. The crowed was going crazy over Mitchell's solo but was "boo"ing me at the same time. After his solo, Mitchell started yelling at me, asking why I ruined his solo. I said I was just trying to help. After that little outburst, I slunk off to the bedroom, but as I got through the doorway, it turned into the deck of the people next door at our cottage. Then three ravens started swooping around me. I fell to the ground and curled up, while two were somewhat pecking at my neck. They weren't actually biting me nor pecking, but just nudging it while the third raven stood about 2 feet away, just watching.
