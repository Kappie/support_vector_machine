     
      Well then, let me introduce myself. I'm Jed (Actually my name is Debb but then I ain't an effeminate lad, so blame it on my mom, anywayz u may call me whatever you feel calling me) --- and I'm no South Korean punk. I currently live here in the west coast, taunting for Death to come, and I'm a working student. As if anybody cares.   I'm actually a friend of a friend of a friend which makes my friend's friend my friend also, that's if they want me to be their friend, get it?   Thats it... STARBUCKS!!! (get a hold of yourself, Jed, or u may scare the hell out  of 'em)
