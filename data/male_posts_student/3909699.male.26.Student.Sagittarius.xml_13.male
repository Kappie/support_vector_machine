The gardens shrink as we get back toward the beginning of the twentieth century, presaging terraces as the semis cluster closer together and develop alleyways at the back. Then, suddenly, we are in Manchester proper, the Victorian city, with acres of terraced maze, warrens of nineteenth century redbrick. After Sydney, Manchester is like Pompeii, an entire Victorian city preserved whole. A city I had once thought a depressing shithole now has an incredible Gothic majesty.
