Now tt juz suxs. L0L! Well, so it's juz gonna be realli boring and stuffs. Going to school is always a 2 way thing, gd and bad. But rite now, I juz see it as a pretty bad thing. Haha, hopefully it won't sux as much as I think it would.  Well, not much activities the past few days. I dunnoe why I dun haf the energy to do anything for the past few days. I'm like juz slacking all the time. Either sleeping, watching euro, playing the com or eating. Yea, tt's bout' it. L0L! I'm juz too damn lazy to do anything. This juz shows how "ready" I am for sch tmr. *Sighz* I've gotta start saving up more money now. I still hafta watch Spider man 2 wif a fren and buy presents for certain ppl. Man, I juz hope tt I haf tt kindda cash now. Money always seem to be sucha issue in every teenager. L0L!  Watching Euro 04 for the past few days has not been pleasing at all! I'm supposed to earn cash and not lose it. I've lost in 2 matches in 2 consecutive days, like at least $20 gone? Man does tt sux! I juz hafta hope tt Czech Republic defeats Denmark tmr morning. They juz haf to rite now, if not I'll be losing 3 matches in 3 consecutive days! Damn! Hell No! I ain't losing! So Czech, u guys noe wad to do rite? Good!  I can already see tt tmr's gonna be a damn tiring day. I'll probably rush home after sch to slp if there isn't any shitz to do. Man, I juz remembered. I still hafta wake up early to comb my hair! Oh Man! *Sighz* I juz hope I won't be late although I've got a feeling tt I will. L0L! But I guess I'll hafta wake up on time and not waste precious time. And I hope when I switch on the tv to Chan 21 tmr, I'll see tt Czech Republic defeated Denmark wif ease. Alrite alrite, enough crapping ok!? L0L! Cya around~! =]
