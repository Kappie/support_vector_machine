I have to get through three exams: World History - Wednesday Biology - Thursday English ("Part 2 of Exam") - Friday Easy? Ish. I just want to get Biology out the way. That's gonna be murder apparently. I'll be writing a novel! Haha.   In the "That's FUCKING Awesome" File... I have an interview tonight! Wish us luck. Duude. I want this job. I'm getting my hair cur for it. Booooo. I've been growing it for months. Ah well. It'll be gone soon enough. Bah. Baaaah.  Well the bell rings... Soon for the LAST time. *One tear* Not! lol. Later.
