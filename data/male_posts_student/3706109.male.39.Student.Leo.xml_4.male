When I was a kid growing up in the seventies, technology wasn't that advanced and we didn't have all of the high speed games that we have now. I remember when Atari came out with Pong, our mom managed to get us a used version of the game and we thought we were stylin'. Keep in mind that this wasn't just any version of the game. That's right baby, with the flip of a switch,we could go from Pong to Breakout. We were the envy of the neighborhood and kids would actually come over and hang out just to play the game.   My how times have changed. In the past thirty years, technology has increased a thousand-fold and the characters in games have changed from two sticks knockingballs back and forth, to lifelike animated characters that actually resemble human beings. Instead of trying to get the little ball past your opponent to score a point,the purpose now is the get by your opponent at any cost. By shootingyour competitoror blowing him up with some sort of explosive, you get more than points; in fact, you get to earn stockpiles of ordinance and extra lives.   According to   Game Over  , 90% of homes now have access to video games and average about 1.5 hours of playing time per day. If this is true, then those playing the games are exposed toabout 547.5 hours of degradation, violent bloodshed, sexism, and racial stereotypes per year. Those are just the things that I was able to come up with from the video and, depending on where you are coming from, I'm sure there are others.   The question is, if violent video games are so prevalent and are supposed to beconditioning individuals to act a certain way, then why are we not seeing more people acting out as a result of playing these games? Why are more people not blowing things up and smackin' down their hoes like we see in the virtual world? Well, for me, the truth is simple: People are more than capable of distinguishing real life from virtual life and, for the majority, these things are simply not acceptable. People, despite their many flaws, are able to separate their real and virtual worlds. I'm sure this is disappointing to all of the arm-chair mental health professionals out there, but I'm sure that my arm-chair degree is more sound than theirs and that I am correct in my analysis.     Game Over   scored some big points when they introduced the retiredLt. Col. who discussed the Army's use of video training tools to improve the response times of individuals preparing for certain combat situations. However, I believe that the conditioned response of soldiers to combat scenarios is far different that the fantasy, cartoonshootouts experienced by eleven-year-olds in their living rooms.   Also discussedin the video was the Marine Corps' use of Doom, a game that actually scripts the act of killing, as a training aid for combat Marines. I would really love for someone to conduct a study of the Marines whoparticipated in this type of trainingto determinewhether it was the game or good old fashioned training that prepared them forKuwait, Haiti, Somalia, and Iraq. As a former Soldier,Marine, and combat veteran, I am willing to bet that none of those asked would say that Doom helped them win a battle.   Back in the day, people said that when records were played backwards you could hear satanic messages from thedevil worshipping rockstars performing the songs. When movies started getting big, there was a fear that people would act out because of a desire to emulatecharacters from the films.I believe that video games are simply the media of the moment and that they will be in the spotlight until something new comes along. Until then, I'll be playing the video games that have the girls with thebig...uh...heads: because we all know that smart chicks are sexy!!
