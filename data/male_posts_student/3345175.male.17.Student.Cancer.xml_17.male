This morning was my first Higher exam, which are, for those of you that aren't Scottish and dont know about our education system, the senior exams that universities and employers tend to focus on.  Today was English. Fun.  How bloody super-powered do they really think we are? We are 16 year olds, the laziest age-group in almost every society  EVER!  And they expect us to not only go through a 50 mark Close Reading in and hour and a half, and then two essays inside the same time?! No notes allowed in, no texts, no idea of the type of questions you'll be asked, with the SQA (Scottish Qualifications Authority) having no idea of what texts you've studied.  TWO FUCKING ESSAYS?! GET THE FUCK REAL!  It was awful. There were only two questions i could've done, and with both of them i had to twist the arguement like nobodys business.  Anyway last night i barely slept. My bladder is worrying me now too: i had to get out of the exam hall twice this morning to pee, having already gone to the toilet before the first paper and before the second paper.  Of course you don't care about any of this. At all. And do i blame you?  Nope. Coz you're probably not even reading this in the first place, so i dunno who the hell i think i'm talking to.        "GRAB A BOTTLE, HUNKER DOWN, AND PRAY FOR DAYLIGHT!!!"
