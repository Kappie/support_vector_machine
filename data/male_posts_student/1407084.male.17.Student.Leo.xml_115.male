Since everyone  liked to buy flowers from the men of God, a rival florist across  town thought the competition was unfair. He asked the good fathers  to close down, but they would not. He went back and begged the  friars to close. They ignored him. So, the rival florist hired Hugh MacTaggart, the roughest and most vicious thug in town to "persuade"  them to close. Hugh beat up the friars and trashed their store,  saying he'd be back if they didn't close up shop. Terrified,  they did so, thereby proving that Hugh, and only Hugh, can  prevent florist friars.
