Well it does actually, but i prefer to call it the "magic rev increasing device of doom" which is pretty self explanatory.  2) If you flash your lights, everyone thinks you mean them.  So if you do it at a busy junction you can make people walk into oncoming traffic  3) the reverse is now the "make sure its dead pedal"  thats about it for now.  next lesson on sat.  so stay off the roads!!!!!!!!!!.  you dont actually have to,  the probability of me managing to run over everyone in the whole world who is on a road is quite small.  Its quite unlikely i will hit or hurt anyone really.  Im really a very good driver.  The joke everyone makes about staying off the roads is actually a not very funny cliche about killing people by accelerating a ton of metal into them.  do you see?  got 1.5 days to revise for maths now.  Sounds a lot of time but maths is actually 3 subjects cunningly weaved into one on the basis that they all involve maths.  Physics only narrowly escaped being maths, it wasnt going to have a name but was to be referred to by a series of claps.  Stats, pure, mechanics and clapclapclap was the plan.  it never happened though because the inventer fell off a bridge precisely 0.4 seconds after he thought of it.  He should have looked where he was going instead of thinking about a fibbonacci sequence of claps that he could use to ensnare the maths bits of chemistry into his sordid mathematical hell.
