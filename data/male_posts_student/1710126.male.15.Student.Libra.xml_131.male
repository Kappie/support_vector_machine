HB for our parents, the guides; 2B for those in-passing. 4B for friends who make your day, 6B for friends who are always there. 8B are for our confidantes, To lend a listening ear.   But love is the thing that adds colour, beautiful, lasting yet hard to erase. For no erasers can take away colour.  On your own sheet of paper...do you see color? blue, red, yellow...  But if theres one thing i have learnt from art,  is neva to tear up ur piece of work,  no matter how ugly it is.   Keep it. Change it. Edit. Salvage what you have.  have patience. An be daring.  In the end, what you'll get  is a beautiful piece of work. For no matter how abstract it is, It is what u have trusted most in.
