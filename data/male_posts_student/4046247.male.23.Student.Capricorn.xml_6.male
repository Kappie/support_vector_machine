The result of this referendum, which the OAS and the Carter Center appear to be in the process of certifying as free and fair, must be respected, so long as it is clear and evident that Mr. Chavez leads Venezuela by the mandate of the Venezuelan people.       Mr. Chavez is the dreaded enfant terrible of the Venezuelan upper class, a combination of populist and revolutionary. His mission involves removing the elite from positions of economic power and influence throughout the country, and using the state oil company, PEDEVESA, Petroleos de Venezuela, to fund expanisve social programs.       We can debate the good and bad points of the Chavez regime all day long. It has its positive aspects. Clearly, Chavez has done more to lift the Venezuelan people out of poverty than his incredibly corrupt predecessors, like Rafael Caldera and Carlos Andres Perez. I couldn't see either of those two leaders making a sincere attempt at doing anything to alleviate the misery that stalks much of the nation, which, like Nigeria, its African counterpart in OPEC, has learned the difficult lesson that oil is, as an analyst in  Foreign Affairs  put it years ago, a curse for developing countries, a reinforcer of social stratification and an invitation to waste and massive spending on vain infrastructural superprojects and unnecessary military equipment. The elite in Venezuela, much like the elite throughout Latin America, have in Hugo Chavez the leader that they deserve; his Bolivarian Revolution is an answer to their oppression of centuries, to their historic rape of the land, the Indians, and the African slaves, and to their right wing dictatorships and their flimsy, oligarchic democracies. If the Panamanians have a saying, that  "cada pueblo tiene el gobierno que merece " (each people has the government it deserves), it applies to some of those Venezuelans today who stomp and who cry, as they witness the dislocations at PEDEVESA and elsewhere, engineered by the Bolivarian leader.       My friend Nadia Buchai, whose Ukrainian Orthodox Church I am looking forward to attending, tells me that when she was in Venezuela, there often were electrical blackouts. Imagine that: electrical blackouts in an oil rich land! And why? Because, according to Nadia, the rich in Venezuela believed it to be beneath them to pay electricity and water bills. Noblesse disobliged.      Such anecdotes, as well as first hand experience of how wealthy  criollo  whites throughout Latin America treat and refer to "the Indians," do much to explain "Chavismo" to me, by casting Chavez's social programs in a specific social and historical context, itself imprinted in my conscience.      Now, I do not idealize Chavez. He holds the dubious and stupid distinction of being the only world leader to visit Saddam Hussein after the Persian Gulf War. His massive spending, touched off by the high price of oil and responsible for some of the referendum votes in his favor, reminds one of the enormous superprojects embarked upon by Mexican President Jose Lopez Portillo (1976-1982), who believed that massive oil deposits discovered off the coast of the state of Campeche, in the Gulf of Mexico, would provide the funds to purchase Mexico's pathway to prosperity.  Once the price of oil declined, Mexico set off an international wave of default on foreign debt that ruined the country and left many destitute, with no choice but to emigrate!!!        Yet Chavez was elected democratically, and now that his election has been reaffirmed, the opposition must respect the results. There should be no emulation of Pedro Carmona's briefly successful 2002 officer's coup.    Both sides need to bring some civility to the table of Venezuelan political dialogue.      President Bush should cooperate with Chavez. Venezuela sends us 1.5 million barrels of oil daily.     The two are at opposite ideological poles, and the Bush Administration has traditionally taken a haughty attitude toward Latin governments that are not pliant (I'm thinking of the record of former Bush adviser Otto Reich, as well as of statements made by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick, who told the Brazilians that they could trade with Antarctica if they did not support the FTAA). Statements made by Ari Fleischer during the unfolding of the Carmona coup, which intimated (and was widely interpreted as intimating) support for the coup plotters, damaged Bush's credibility in Venezuela and the surrounding region.
