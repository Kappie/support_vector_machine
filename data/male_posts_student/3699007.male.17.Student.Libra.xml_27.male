But going to the movies at 7:30 was weird since I usually don't go until NOW.  I'm pretty bored right now because nobody is online.  My grandmother had another mini-stroke today.  This isn't good...I have a bad feeling it's builing up to a really big one and then she'll never remember who I am again.  What a horrible thought.  Anyway, I'm gonna go find something to eat and wait for somebody to get their ass on here...and oh what a nice ass it is! :-)
