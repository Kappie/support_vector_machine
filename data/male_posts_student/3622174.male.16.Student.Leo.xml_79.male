So, here are my random thoughts and ideas for the day:  -The WB Superstar USA: As I sit here and watch the season finale of The WB Superstar USA, I think, what the crap was the WB thinking?  Alright, first of all, the judges look shockingly similar to the judges of American Idol- The White guy is mean, the chick is the inspirational one, and the black guy is honest, but, not 100% of the time. The host, doesn't he look similar to Ryan Seacrest, the host of American Idol?  Yes, yes he does.  But why did they do this?  Well, one simple thing: they went around auditioning for "the best singer in America," but, the catch: they were actually looking for the worst.  So they made it just like American Idol, right down to the format and feel of the show, judges included.  Well, now, on the finale tonight, they're going to reveal that they were looking for the worst singers in America, and one will be crowned just that.  Will it be back for another season?  No, probably not.  It's hard to pull off something like this twice.   -Drivers Ed.: Absolutely boring me to death.  Yeah, like I said the other day, there's some of my friends in there that try to keep me entertained, but, most of the stuff in that class is so obvious.  I just wish I could get As on more of the tests!  But, aside from being bored, there's also some annoyances.  There's two people in particular that are really getting on my nerves.  One sits around me, and the other sits on the other side of the room.  The one that sits around me, I barely even know this person, and he acts like we're the best of friends or something.    -Universal: I haven't been to Universal in such a long time, I think I need to stop one day soon.  My trip up north was postponed until the end of July, because my parents sold my old house finally, and we have to get stuff out of it before they close.  So, I think I'm gonna try and go some time next week.  The new Mummy ride is supposed to be awesome, and I can't wait to get on it.    Well, that's pretty much all that's going through my mind right now.  There's something that's bothering me, but, I'll discuss that in a later post.  Until next time, adios!
