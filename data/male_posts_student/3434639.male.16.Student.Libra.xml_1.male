Then the figure started approaching me at top speed. I walked fatser but the thing was gaining on me. When it caught up to me it was standing in the shadow of a house, so i couldn't see its facial features. I guess it was a face only a mother could love. Then it turned into a stupid boy wearing spectacles running around with a wand and fighting "monsters and evil wizards". I then took out my super weapon, a giant two handed sword which i have endowed upon the name "Idiot Slayer" and i chopped the monsters head off. I went home and immediately afterward I got an e-mail stating that i have won the Nobel Prize for Peace because of my chivalric action of subduing the monster.The End.  P.S. They dont want to give me the $ 1,000,000 cheque that they are supposed to give. I could have died, who knows what that monster could have done to me!! They should at least give me some compensation for what i could have lost!
