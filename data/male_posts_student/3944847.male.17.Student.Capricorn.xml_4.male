I`m also not sure...This morning I woke up at 5am and went to school at 6am...Nothing special happens during the school lessons...During the school lesson, I received the CD that she said she wanted to borrow me...But she was so cold at me...She did not even smile when she gave me the CD...Then after school , me and my friend was staying back for the Indoor Games Club and also for the Hornbill meeting...At first we went to the hall to take a look on the "prayer meeting"... After that , we went back to the canteen to have our lunch...I did not eat anything because I was still full... Then , we went to the office to hang around there... And yes , she and her ex were there with other friends... I did not want to disturb them so I was sitting outside playing the other computer... I was waiting for the Hornbill meeting... Then she came and see what I`m doing and ask me to go in and join the other friends...So I went in do nothing...Just having some chatting with friends and teachers... She was chatting with her ex happily in their own world... I wasn`t really care about that and I did not really feel jealous about that...But somehow suddenly I felt I have lost all my confident...When I saw them so close , I was feeling that I should just give up... Who knows if they will get back together ? Who knows ? However , I tell myself not to give up...I must continue this battle...My brain told me that but my heart tells me that I should give up...What should I do ? One of my friend told me that she said she don`t even like me... Maybe this is the sign which the story will end soon... I remembered she told me once that relationship starts with smile , grows with hug , and ends with tears...This relationship haven`t start and grow yet but it`s already ended with tears...Will the relationship start ? Sigh*...
