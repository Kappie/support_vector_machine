The scenery is so pretty you wish you could ride along them, but not in the same mission. I know this movie didn't get good reviews, still, as I have said before: you should decide if a movie is good or not. It was exactly what I hoped for. I know is long and slow, but if I could bear it, anyone can. Blanchet's is great. Jones is too. The girls are great indeed. Now for those movie critics that are fat and soggy in their behinds, and that seem to have seen to many western movies: a chase is a chase, and until you have done one in the wild, just don't critic this one.     Gothika.  Mmmh. Miss it. Is all I can say. Still as with the one above, go see it in a matinee, so your money lose is less.    Brother Bear.  Oh my God. What a pretty movie. The relation between the cub and the bear is excellent. You'll cry  if  you are not dead inside.
