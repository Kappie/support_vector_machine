The bedtime for last night and the night befor have been around 9:30 - 10. Hey, Im tired, and i finally gave in. Im actually sneaking onto the computer now, im somehow grounded from it... wasting electricity or something. Another bogus rule that will no longer exist in a week... Anyways, highlights from the past days.    Spiderman 2 - Best movie of all time. I feel like i was entranced in it. I was part of the movie. Everytime he shook, i shook, everytime he cried, i felt like crying (even though i didnt, i think Katie did though...) For the first time since i was six, i came out of a superhero movie actually wanting to be the Superhero... lol. So I got all emotional over that, my friends say it will ware down, but i plan on seeing it two more times within the next week.     Naples - I drove to west florida today, Naples, relatives. Its so hot there, the air is weird. I guess im just an east coast kind of guy...    Warped tour - Its in a week, and i cant wait. We still have to finalize transportation issues, and figure out whether to use ticketmaster, or buy at the gate... Anyways, Daniel went today, and called randomly letting us listen to the bands, it was cool, except i could only make out the end... Sugarcult, oh they are great...     Well, i think this will be one of hte very eventful weeks of the summer. Itll be cool.  Well, im tired, ill talk later.    Ok... lyrics, lyrics... alright, Im in a D.C. mood...    Dashboard Confessional  Ghost of a Good Thing     I guess it's luck, but it's the same    Hard luck, you've been trying to tame    Maybe it's love, but it's like you said,    "Love is like a role that we play."       But, I believe in you so much    I could die for the words that you say    But, I believe in you so much    I could die from the words that you say       But, you're chasin' the ghost of a good thing    Haunting yourself as the real thing    It's getting away from you again    While you're chasin' ghosts       I guess it's luck, but it's the same   Hard luck, you've been trying to tame    Maybe it's love, but it's like you said,    "Love is like a role that we play."       But, I believe in you so much    I could die for the words that you say    But, I believe in you so much    I could die from the words that you say       But, you're chasin' the ghost of a good thing    Haunting yourself as the real thing    It's getting away from you again    While you're chasin' ghosts       Just bend the pieces til they fit    Like they were made for it    But, they weren't meant for this    No, they weren't meant for this       Just bend the pieces til they fit    Like they were made for it    But, they weren't meant for this       Chasin' the ghost of a good thing    Haunting yourself as the real thing   It's getting away, away, away, away from you again      Chasin' the ghost of a good thing   Haunting yourself as the real thing   It's getting away from you again   While you're chasin' ghosts    The rhythym of this song is very relaxing.  The whole CD is amazing, but this is definatly one of their more EMO songs. Well, im tired, and it took a while to find those lyrics so, Good night.
