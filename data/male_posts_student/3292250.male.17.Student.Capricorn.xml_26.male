Not my usual A/C-equipped bus mind you, but some different one that's all older and clunky. Anyway, the point of this rambling story is a friend of mine, Zack, is sitting across from me, talking to some sophomore girl (who's name escapes me) in the seat in front of me. The subject of their conversation is the recent Iraqi prisoner scandal and the  urlLink recent execution of American Nick Berg . While I knew of both these accounts and am happy to say I stay on top of the news, both of them were oblivious the these incidents until the other night. Frankly, I was appalled. Their reasoning is that the world is full of bad stuff that they would rather not deal with, so they don't watch the news; "ignorance is bliss" they say.  In my opinion, ignorance is not bliss. It's ignorance that gets Bush elected into office and ignorance is the keystone of discrimination throughout history. It saddens me to see how lazy teens are these days. They don't know current events, they don't care about politics, and they don't get involved in the community or a worthy cause. Ask Zack who the  urlLink DNC  Presidential candidates where and he couldn't tell you. (For record, they were John Edwards, Dennis Kucinich, Al Sharpton, Carol Mosley Braun, Wes Clark, Howard Dean, Dick Gephardt, and Joe Leiberman, with John F. Kerry taking the party nomination). I hope these kind of people never vote; they'd walk into a booth and start punching a name.
