First I checked out deadjournal.com to see what that was all about, and I found out, you have to pay. So that idea got scratched. Then I went back to livejournal, too bad for them their website was running very slow and being stupid. So I came to blogger. But I don't think I am staying here, I like Livejournal much better, the options are better there. So this is my 'settle' journal.   I was online today, on livejournal, then I hear the sound my modem makes when it disconnects from the internet. But a second didn't go by after that happened that the phone rang. The caller ID didn't pick up the name, but I got the phone number. So I go back online and go to google and put the phone number into a search. The results? CVS in Glenmont. So I was thinking, why would they call? The call couldn't be of dire importance because they didn't leave a message.  Then I was talking to Erik and he was wowing me with his knowledge of College Football by giving me scores to bowl games from 2 years ago. And while he was doing this I was playing XBOX and I was losing. In what game? College Football. So I was pissed off at the game, so I turned it off. And I haven't picked up the controller since. :)  Then my dad got home and we left to play tennis at the Board. He promptly beat be, with a vengance. I lost 6-1. The key stat: I lost in 19 Minutes!  And before in my day I went to Lowe's for some plywood. Then to Wendy's for lunch. Papermill for my grandfather to pick up the Anniversary cards my grandmother left on the counter there. Then, finally, to CVS to get stuff for my face, and Skittles.  Now I am talking to Susan about how my dog eats fish and Listening to Hey Mercedes. Check out my Profile. Or  urlLink here  is the link, just for  YOU!
