Today I went to get a prescription filled and the rushing frat boy behind the counter (I saw his pledge pin, It's not just me stereotyping) informed me that since I last got the prescription filled on the 5th of Oct, it was too soon to get it filled again, and it would have cost $80.  I explained that the dosage changed, and he said that I'd have to have a doctor tell him that.  So I tried calling the Dr's office.  Of course, they only do business til 5:00 and I happened to call at 5:15.  I tried the afterhours nurse.  She told me to call back in the morning.  Granted part of this falls on my shoulders because I didn't notify Osco that the prescription was upped, but if someone would have given me a heads up on all of this I wouldn't have to make another trip to Osco tomorrow and wake up early so I give the nurses and insurence people ample time to fuck things up so that by the time I come back from classes I can have some medication so I don't curl into the fetal position due to pain.  I ask for so little and get less in return.  I miss compitent nurses and people who have worked at the pharamcy for more than a few weeks.  BLAST!
