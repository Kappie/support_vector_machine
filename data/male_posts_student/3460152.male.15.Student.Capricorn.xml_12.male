If you click on 'View My Complete Profile' then you can see it!  The photo was taken a couple of years ago on a ski trip to Italy with my school.  The photo looks better as it was originally, however I decided that as this blog is about me, the photo will only be of me too!  I am not good at cropping so it looks a bid dodgey!  UPDATE: I no longer have red in my fringe! I have grown out of that stage of my life lol!  I will try and get a better picture one day. I just don't know when that one day will be!  Bye!  Stefan
