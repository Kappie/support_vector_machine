It represents our journals (if and when we chose to publish our personal lives), thoughts and insights, or just crazy things we found on our road trip on the Information Superhighway. I, if you're wondering, am the guy who is in charge of this site (to be a techie, I'm the admin. To be a super techie, I'm the root). I am also the editor-in-chief of the  urlLink Gopher's Herald , and will probably be the one posting most of the time, since my other staff members at the moment (aka Fred) might not choose to publish anything. Ok, well, that's that. Yeah. You can go now.
