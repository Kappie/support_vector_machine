Of course, being the social being that I am, I invited Kyle along, and so we went, and he let me borrow his really awesome CD, THANX KYLE....YOU ROCK!!! ANYWHO!!!  When we got there, the lights were on and the dogs weren't in their kennel, so I naturally thought that they were home....but they weren't.  Kyle and I figured this fact out after like 1/2 an hour of ringing the doorbell and knocking on the door.  I went around to the backside to check to see if the back door was open(which it usually is) and it wasn't.....well...poo.  How am I gonna get myself out of this one....hm..... I go back to the front and get Kyle and we walked around the house for a while, tryin' to figure out SUM way of getting in, then I had the brilliant idea of breaking in, but none of the doors are break-inable...hm.....except for one...the garage door. So we make our way to the back garage door, and I ask Kyle for a card(me of course having hundreds in my wallet, just forgetting about them) so he hands me his Drivers License, which I use to try and get the door open, after a while, we hear a click....so I gave him his card back because we thought I was gonna break it, and at this point I remembered that I have all of MY cards, so I grab one(PacSun gift card, don't kare too much) and start fiddlin' around with that, after quite sum time I was about to give up, until I felt a bump in the door that I hadn't noticed before...so I went after it. VOILA!!! OPEN DOOR!! WE walk into the house, grab a few pops, eat sum snacks, go upstairs to get the games.....and left. It was pretty fun and very eventful. TOMORROW'S MY LAST DAY OF SCHOOL FOR A WHILE!!! w00t!  I know you're all gonna miss me, but don't get too emotional, I'll be back. :-P Peace!  Spense
