Will I am not in the same class as Jonathan, Yeo or Serene... How can that be?!!!! Haiz... We were all separated and I was hoping that we can be in the same class. The Workshop is not as fun as the TPSU camp though. Haiz and most of the guys are so >.  If i'm not wrong my hair was burned!!! I stayed too long under the hot sun and the Mud i applied on my hair kind of got over-cooked!!! Lucky it better not catch fire. (-.-")  We kind of 'influence' Serene to go to Parkway with the 3 of us to have our dinner as Yeo wants to go see her ai ai.. She was so fussy and keep complaining that she want to go home. Sound like a small girl girl huh?   I went to the airport to fetch my dad who have just come back from China. Is this a blessing or a bad omen? He is going to nag at me because my room is in a total mess! Too many things to bo yet so little time. Haiz~
