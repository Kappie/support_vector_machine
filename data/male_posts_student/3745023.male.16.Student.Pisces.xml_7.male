Sorry for the misspelling, I don't have time to proofread today, and stuff is going on that I have to post on.  RFID Update* They have finally figured it out. They have found the leverage they need to make RFID a welcomed tech, by the entirty of the world. Convieniance. European retailer, Metro, has designed and plans to implement a system in which you, the costumer, would shop by feeding a computor a list, it mapping out the best course for you to take, you shopping, and then just waltzing out with out paying as the stuff you bought sends a signal to a reciever that automaticly charges it all to your credit card. Dam. I will not give up gracefully though. The games not over till they tag me.  Animal update* A man in Chille ,Juan Acuqa, dragged himself into a hospital after being alledgedly attacked by two winged creatures with dog faces. His wounds do not appear to be made by knives, scratchs or blows. The description he gives us of them make them sound nothing more than a Catholic daemon, even down to the point of not touching water. I have my suspitions that it is a hoax or cover up, but it is worth noting that a UFO was sited in Chilli not a week ago. for your own viewing, please go  urlLink here
