To win, one would have to be aggressive don’t cha know – a stance certainly unpleasant to our allies, annoying to our enemies and utterly inimical to Dem principles.   Carter stood firm: he would not win against inflation or stagnation; he did not defeat the ‘malaise’; he handed out countries like party favors to the Soviets (to be fair, Carter did manage a spirited defense against the  urlLink Killer Rabbit ).   If memory serves, America won the cold war because American voters had the sense to drop-kick that feckless fool out of the White House. We elected Ronald Reagan, who had a plan for defeating the Soviets, a plan that was universally derided and relentlessly opposed by the Dems.   The Dems officially abandoned any concept of winning a conflict in 1968. I didn’t.
