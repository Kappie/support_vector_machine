They give a guy who cannot sing or play any instruments a record deal?  The whole American Idol thing still strikes me as preposterous anyway, mostly because I think it cheapens the abilities of those who actually work their asses off practicing and playing in bars and making music their life.  I'm all for letting talent take its shot, but honestly, does American Idol provide us with talent, or just this 15 minutes' star?  It's corporate crap at its bloody worst, I think, and I wish they'd just cancel the whole damn show, set Simon Cowell on fire, and be done with the whole thing.  And fire that Justin guy from the first season out of a cannon without a helmet.  As big as that idiot's hair is, he'll be plenty padded for headfirst impact.  In other news, work on the Thesis has progressed to the actual writing stage.  Hoping to have 5-10 pages by the night's end.  We'll just have to see what happens.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Toad the Wet Sprocket, "Jam"
