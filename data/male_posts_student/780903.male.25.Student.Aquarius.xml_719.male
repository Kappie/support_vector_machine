My TV has a sleep timer, and I was smart to set it.  I missed the good stuff.  Went to sleep when the Red Sox were still in the lead in the 7th or 8th I think.  Sometimes at these interviews, they tape the Attorney's Bio to the door, so you can read it before going in to interview.  They look something like this, but with different words:  Bill Z. Smith Very Senior Partner Salmon, Tuna, Catfish and Haddock LLP  Office: New York  Joined Salmon, Tuna: 05/01/1935  Education: Harvard Law School (LLB, 1932), founding member of Law Review, President of the Students In Favor Of Post-Civil War Reconstruction, Vice-President of the fledgling Automobile Society, Treasurer of the Radio Club; Columbia University (BA, Economics, magna cum laude, 1928) Thesis topic: "Will the economy ever recover from this terrible slump we seem to have been having recently?"  Bar Admissions: New York  Clerkship: Chief Justice William Taft; Chief Justice John Jay  Bill Z. Smith is a very senior partner based in the New York office.  Mr. Smith's practice focuses on financial reorganization, emerging capital markets, and taking out his false teeth for the amusement of others.  Mr. Smith recently celebrated his 68th anniversary at Salmon, Tuna and hopes to be around for 68 years more.  He earns more money than many small nations, and is proud to be distinguished as a featured practitioner in the new guide, "America's Oldest Lawyers."  He is widely published in the AARP's member magazine, Modern Maturity, where he writes a monthly column, "Modern?  Not Me!"  He received his law degree back before the days of electricity, and defended the North during the Civil War.  In his spare time, he enjoys sailing, discus, and piloting his own small plane.  No one else at the firm will fly with him, however.  He is happily married to Ethel, his wife of 142 years, and they have fourteen children, thirty-six grandchildren, eighty-four great-grandchildren, and six hundred thousand great-grandchildren, who make up the population of the entire country of Finland.  He feels bad that his bio, which started out as a subtle attempt at humor, has turned into a ridiculously over-the-top farce that makes little sense.  Mr. Smith can be reached by telegraph at Clydesdale-3-7, or with one of those cans attached to a string.
