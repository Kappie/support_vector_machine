Barring any serious typing injury or dismemberment or a total lack of an audience.  That would suck.  Not that it will happen but that would totally defeat the purpose of his blog really.  Cuz without it he would just be telling things to nobody and just reading it himself and commenting on it with different fake names to try and make himself feel better.  And no, he doesn't do that now.  The only time he posts a comment is when he uses the name Tyke.  So don't think that he is making all of those comments.  Not that they are anything important anyway.  Well hey, this is a good sign.  Tyke has already rambled for a good little bit and has racked up some nice volume to this cylindrical spherical cube.  Today started off nicely.  Oh wait, it didn't actually.  He had a stupid 1st period.  His teacher is stupid.  She really is being stupid.  This semester she has tried to teach and enforce rules.  Like, who the hell cares biatch???  Come on, shut the hell up.  Nobody likes you.  Go back to fuckin Denmark.  Go ride a windmill while your there and then maybe you will get crabs or something and then have to live in a cardboard box for the remainder of your pitiless existence of a life.  Eh, the rest of the day progressed alright.  English entailed the denoument of the Sula presentation.  Just answering some questions and Tyke did fine with that.  Mainly cuz he never got asked a question directly so he just got to add tidbits of sensical nonsense.  It was just some good old mumbo jumbo.  Went to Mickie D's today.  Another free lunch thanks to the gift certificates he got there in his stocking over Christmas.  Kind of an odd gift but really, quite valuable.  He loves knowing that he can have a free lunch one day a week if he wants.  That is a great feeling cuz he never wants to make a lunch so he just doesn't.  Even though he can make a mean bagel with cream cheese.  Mmmm...bagel.  Mmmm...monkey.  Mmmm...pistol whip.  Well anyway, thats cool.  So how bout those things?  Doin good?  Nice.  Yep.  Not too bad.  Not sure what this is supposed to be but the possibilities are limited.  Not limitless.  Limited.  After school Tyke returned home to his abode again, just to sit around for nothing.  He watched a nice little double package of Full House though.  The ones where Jesse and Becky get married.  And Michelle, she's so cute :), is being all cutesie and such.  It's really a classic dual episode.  And then the song that Jesse sings as his vows is really good.  Sorta.  It's good.  But it is so fake with his voice and Becky's too.  He loves looking at the show now and seeing all the insane stuff that happens in the show and how he didn't think anything of it when he watched the show as a little kid.  Like what family kisses and hugs this much???  Yeesh, they are like a newlywed couple but related.  It's kinda gross.  Especially seeing Danny always kissing Michelle.  How gross would that be now??  Some like 55 year old geezer (eww my dad's that old) kissing this really hot 18 (almost...) year old on the forehead and blowing on her tummy.  That would be gross.  It would be gross for Tyke to do it even.  But oh would he love it.  Speaking of love it Tyke talked with Tina at the basketball game tonight.  Oh man...he just couldn't pass up that transition.  Don't worry, his feelings have truly dissipated considerably.  Sorta.  But enough of that.  He is going to start censoring his thoughts somewhat on this blog.  However, online and in person he is free to talk about anything.  Oh yeahhhhh.  Sorry, he is just blabbering on now.  But the game was fun.  Guys got hosed but still fun.  Talking with the crew.  Getting a little rub down from Dotti (wink wink nudge nudge tickle tickle).  That had to be resurrected sometime.  The tickle tickle that is.  Can't be overused though.  So stop.  No more.  Tyke is really looking forward to playing some bball again.  He hasn't really played since the game against the Sly Lioners.  And that was fun.  That was a great time really.  It was really cool how Haras and Purdy came and cheered them on while filming.  He wants to have a little get together with them to watch the tape and hang out sometime.  Hey, Tyke's free on Friday.  Wink wink.  Yeah, he's always free.  Go him!!!  They probably won't be but ya never know these days.  If you know what he means.  Do you?  That would be weird if you did.  Cuz he had no meaning.  Ok, seriously.  Stop.  This is just weird.  So...  Umm...bye.  WEDNESDAY!!!!!
