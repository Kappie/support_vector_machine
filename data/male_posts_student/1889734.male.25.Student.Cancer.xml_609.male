The rink operators refunded all of the money but let us skate the session anyway, which I thought was classy.  We did some full rink 2 on 2 just to screw around, and I felt pretty comfortable out there.  My endurance is increasing, and I'm certainly getting the old moves back.  I still can't seem to keep the puck in the glove though.  No problems 'catching' it, but I loose the handle.  So I need a new glove.  First game is Sunday at 9 PM.
