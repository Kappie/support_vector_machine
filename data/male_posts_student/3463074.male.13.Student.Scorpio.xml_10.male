The protagonist of this paticular story was a very disoriented octopus that was picked upon mercilessly by all of the other sea creatures, especially the clown fish, for though there name suggests a kind hearted and funny creature, they are actually supercondensed wads of pure evil, bent on causing utter havoc and displeasure. Anyway, the octopus, henceforth to be called "Larry" as to not divulge any personal information, was a lonesome nerd whom nobody liked at all. His parents had both left him shortly after his birth, unlike those whale children whom he loathed, and for some odd reason, he had been born with a deformity, this deformity being that he sent out pulses every few seconds which made this whole story possible because it caused fish to think in the exact same manner as him, what a coincidence! Well, to start the story, Larry was going to visit his "aunt" the senile starfish "Selma" when he was confronted by numerous Jellyfish, who not only constantly insulted him, they used wonderful insults such as calling him the "spineless blob". They started to say such things to him and zap him, so he of course had to spray ink into all of there faces and run away. Now this may not seem strange to you, but it created an interesting problem for Larry. This problem was of course that he was charged with littering by the mentally altered swordfish police and fined 100 pieces coral. Now, of course he did not have anyware near this much currency because he was constantly paying his neighbors for ink stain damage. So he was of course detained and taken down to the nearest sea anemone jail and put there over night. It actually was many weeks before he got out of there though, because the local shark suffians had decided to eat the police officers. During this time Larry fell in with some of the local criminal Clown Fish, whom were mentioned earlier, They accepted him because they thought that he had done something totally wicked like those totally radical whale punks who had gone and punctured the Exxon Valdez a couple of months ago. Well, to get back to Larry, he learned a few tricks with the Clown Fish, like how to harvest a swordfish's sharp blade and create a very deadlty impliment, along with how ot use his tentacles to pick a lock. After using his lock pick skills, Larry proceeded to the swordfish's remains left by the sharks and harvested there blades. He then paid some various ocean life and thereatened some others into diving down and harvesting some various explosive gases at the bottom of the bottom of one of the gorges, such as methane. After collecting this, he hired a walrus by giving him the souls of the clown fish who had been in jail with, if they even had any, and had the walrus go on land and kill a nearby stone age fanatic who was carrying some iron pyrite and flint. After collecting all of these items, he went into an underwater cave nearby and killed all of the whales nearby by shooting the swordfish blades into there hearts, that and shoving large amounts of stolen corral into there blowholes and harvested their blubber. He took the flammable gases, the bluibber, the iron prrite and the flint to the afore mentioned cave and commited a suicide bombing by lighting the blubber on fire by striking the iron pyrite and the flint together and then put the large amounts of methane gas he had earlier decided to store in the air bladder of a fish into the flame. This chemical reaction caused a catistrofic explosion which caused 15 vlocanoes to simotaneously errupt, three of which where super volcanoes, and not only did this cause the sun to be completly blocked out, it also caused the poles to melt and covered the whole planet in water. Larry died a happy fish whom had gotten his vengance on the world and all those who had teased him.  This was sort of long and very wierd, but the one who told me it said it has a very good morale to it, good writers all have stupid ideas, it's just the ones who have enough free time to look over there work and change it to make it better who do well.
