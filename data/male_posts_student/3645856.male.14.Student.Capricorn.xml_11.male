Yesterday I went to Water Country with Josh and his older sister, her friends, their cousin Patrick... etc. We spent all day there and I made a side salad with soy chicken and italian dressing in it and a soy bologna sandwich... spent all day there and we were pretty tired. It was a fun day. Some of the strangest topics came up during the whole time with them... and we were having fun and as we were getting into a raft at the top of one of the rides, I started talking with a lisp and there was this dude there, Eric from Canada, as his name tag said on the whistle cord on his neck and I said "Well hello, super sexy man" and as we went down, I went, "have a fabulous day." Also... nearing the closing of the park, around 5:30... there were some people about our age and they were trying to run ahead of us and they knocked Amanda, Josh's sister, down, and I helped her up and we never caught up to the guys. But, anyway, about 15 minutes later, we went on the ride again, and the guys tried to do it again, now I like pacifism, but, this was actually funny. As the guys tried to do it again, Amanda was in front of me and I went "look behind us" and they were running up. And as they tried to elbow her, she went "awww, hell no!!!" and threw one of them into a big rubbermaidish type trash can on the edge of the trail going to the slide. Then the other dudes behind the guy in front tried to chase us and I told her to run and I grabbed the trash can and threw it in the path and yelled "Up yours" and ran. Funny as hell. After we changed and everything, I came back and picked the trash can up.... because nobody else would really care to.      After that, we left and drove on Interstate 64 looking for a place to eat, we drove and there was a really bad thunderstorm and we saw a few funnel clouds and we drove all the way up to Lightfoot, a small town on the outskirts of Williamsburg. We ate at a Wendy's there, came home, and Patrick dropped me off... that was pretty much it for the day. I talked to Shelly and I was so tired... she said "brb" and I laid down on my bed within viewing range of the monitor and fell asleep and woke up at 8:00 am. Unbelievable. Already 6:00 pm... June 19th... summer is going fast.     I could go for some popcorn right now. I mean movie theatre style. Yummy. I found that the margarine at the theatre here is non-dairy... vegan popcorn. Yay.. I just found my remotes. It was under my blankets. I need to finish boxing up one of my guitars I sold. I was thinking about buying a new strat, building my own (too much trouble but i'll have something special and what I like when i'm done... in a nitrocellulose finish), a Jackson soloist, or an Ibanez. Something strat style but with a kick to it. Maybe i'll just get another Gibson Les Paul. Anywho... i'm out.  Mood - Disgusted (I need to pick stuff up off of my desk, pick stuff up off of the bed, and make my bed), Aching (sunburn and leg cramps), a bit tired. A little Hungry.  What music I last listened to - Jimi Hendrix, Moby - Landing.  What i'm watching on TV - Spy Hard... I can use a little Leslie Nielson slapstick humor once in a while... not that it's really funny... i've seen this movie a bunch of times.
