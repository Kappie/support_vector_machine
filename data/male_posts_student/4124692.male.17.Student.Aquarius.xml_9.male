People who argue against graffiti always strike me as being quite hypocritical, they'll accept as much advertising as can be shoved in their faces, yet whenever someone has an alternative view and competes for some space, they start to moan. And its always some old bloody Hyacinth, some well intentioned old biddy who can't comprehend anything beyond aestheticism. They dont understand that graffiti exists as a platform to promote and generate ideas, giving people who would otherwise not have had a voice, their chance to be heard. A lot of graffiti has deep sociopolitical undertones and is a reaction to the depravity of urban life. Graffiti didnt destroy the scenery, we did. I doubt very much whether council flats would be that much more aesthetically pleasing without the tags and murals than with them. And its the irresponsible middle/upper class, who dont want to be reminded that there are people living in squalor and depravity still, who complain the most. "Tagging" isnt particularly beautiful, it always strikes me as a sort of futile last stance practiced mainly amongst youths and teenagers out of boredom and a desire for recognition. You see, a tag is something someone can create, something they can see, something others can see and something they can be proud of. There isnt much to be proud of growing up in the working class. However this tagging usually develops into a much more refined art form as the youth matures. First come the tags, then the two tone "dubs" and then the full scale murals. At his most mature stage the graffiti artist truly deserves to be called an artist, and people who underestimate the skill and technique required to produce a half-decent piece should try themselves! Spray cans are'nt the most controllable medium, believe me. So next time you see a tag, a dub or a mural, dont just see some fading paint, some blur on society's clean visage, see someones fading dreams for recognition in a world which would rather forget its poor.
