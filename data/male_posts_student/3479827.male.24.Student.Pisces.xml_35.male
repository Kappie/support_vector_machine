He was very well behaved, he showed me his collection of automan (a japanese cartoon superhero) figures. We also watched several chineses cartoons together, i couldn't understand what was going on, but he was certainly enjoying himself.  Yuqi and her parents were back in time for lunch, so we all ate together. It was constantly raining, so we didn't go out until the weather improved in the evening. Then, it was a quick walk to the supermarket for some shaving gel. I'd run out a couple of days ago, and was starting to look very hairy.  I almost forgot to mention we were visited by yuqi's parents neighbours. They popped in to say hello and were very friendly. I'll have to get to know them a bit better when we have a bit more time.  Tomorrow, we're taking zhou xun to the park, and treating him to pizza for lunch. Should be fun :)
