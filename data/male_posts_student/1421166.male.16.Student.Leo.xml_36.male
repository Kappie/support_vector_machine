True love is like God's love. Agape, sacrificial love. People changed love into a kind of self-centered-ness. They call it "falling in love", which is just a desire to be loved. But agape is different. True love is self-less. Which happens to be the opposite. So if you think "love" is painful, maybe true love is wonderful. God is love, we need God. Today,I just went to school to practice the school and national anthem in the new school. I remember the last time I went there was like still only two storeys. Now it's already almost completed. And seven storeys high!!! Haven't got the school feel yet. Then went home very early(kinda found a way to go home) And slacked around. Somehow ended up sleeping till 3pm. Then woke up, and tidied up my room a bit. Nothing much, except my conversation with my jie about love. Just talked about alot of stuff. I felt confused la. All the feelings and stuff. But I can only hang on. I can't run away cos it's in me. I just have to let God take charge I guess. Tomorrow's first day of school at the new school. So exciting. But it's only cleaning up. Maybe I'll go East Coast some time. Ok...quite a boring day. Thanks jie for being my best friend too! hehe...
