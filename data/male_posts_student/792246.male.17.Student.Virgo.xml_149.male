He wasn't rich enough for her She had a pretty race And her parents couldn't face The horrible sin that would have been  Five years from now It's Passover Cooking the matzah for her seder Turns on TV Guess who she sees Christian boy, on Israeli TV She calls up her mom She already knows And she was planning for them to go They take the plane And go to his house Looks up at the goi that she turned down  He was a Christian boy She said see ya later goi He wasn't rich enough for her Now he's a rabbi fan Plus an Israeli man Does your pretty face see what he's worth (repeat)  Sorry girl but you missed out Well tough luck, that goi's mine now We are more than just good friends This is how the story ends Too bad that she couldn't see See the Jew that goi could be There is more than meets the eye He made brisket it's  inside  He's just a goi And I'm just a Jew Can I make it anymore obvious We are in love Haven't you heard How we rock each other's world  I met a Christian boy I said see ya later goi I'll fly back home along with mom I'll be at at a synagogue Talking to my grandma And she's gonna say "Oi vez mear"
