Since it's spring, there are many new opportunities for macro photos with the small, furry animals, flowers, grass, new-born life, and all that great stuff. I just love that kind of crap.  Also, I have been moving along at a snail's pace reading  The Fountainhead . Anyone read it before? It's such an interesting book and I enjoy reading it, but I want nothing more than to be finished with it already. (You may remember that I mentioned the book about two weeks ago. I thought I would be finished by now.) I actually started reading it so I could write an essay about it for a scholarship. I'm not too sure if that will be happening, but if I have enough time I will give it a go.  That's all I really have to say about that... So for now, I leave you with this question:  How goes the go-going?
