Wow, I better go put out some resumes to get a job so I canget a lease on a car (wellI wouldneed my grandma or someone to co-sign).I also need to take my other 2 young drivers courses,, its just been so warm and it sounds so boring.. Oh well. I doubt I will actually "buy" a car. I mean, a finance is possible..but I don't know if I will need a used car in 4 years like that...
