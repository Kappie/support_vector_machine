It was about time for an overhaul, and I'm kind of restless tonight, so I decide to undertake it.  I mean, if you can't sleep, find something constructive to do,  right?   Well, enjoy the new look and layout of my blog.  I'll try to keep it interesting for you.  Any and all feed back is appreciated.
