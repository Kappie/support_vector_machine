I actually think it's so good I might watch it again tonight..I mean seriously, I laughed like crazy during the whole movie and then at the end I actually got chills from the ending!! I really suggest it, and its a huge plus that Lindsay Lohan is in it, cause i'm a huge fan of hers..I actually watched her other movie (I rented it)-Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen-and it was alright, but nothing great. I actually downloaded Mean Girls, and i'm gonna have to buy the DVD or atleast get a better copy of it because omg, It is an AWESOME movie. Well that was my night omg. Well I did spruce up this website, talked a little bit online..thats about it lol k.
