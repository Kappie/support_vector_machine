I had hoped video games wouldn't be a large part of this summer, but... anyways, when I game, I game straight up. I think my mass atrophied tenfold >_ some  of the designs. The story was more engrossing than I thought it'd be, but the style had a major shift: very cartoony and yet human in certain aspects (I know that doesn't quite make sense, but you have to see it for yourself). I only completed 55% of the overall game and managed to finish it (o_0). I went one day without sleeping altogether; that took a serious toll on my lucidity. It's weird, I think I lose brain mass, cuz' I feel all light-headed and my really-short-term memory gets shot to hell. E.g., I'd hear something or say something and doubt it was even said/heard a second later. I feel like I'm not really filling my entire body, just there, inside of it. This whole thing's been rather dangerous for my health, not to mention, when I did sleep, the hours were so erratic, my perception of time itself faded. I saw myself slowly slipping, I forgot what day it was first, then, when I blocked out the sun (to keep out the glare on the screen), I completely lost my sense of time. At one point, I recall, there was a game that dealt with numbers and simple addition, it took all of my power just to perform those tasks. My diet has been thrown out of whack too, and I didn't take care to tend to my appearance. So right now, I have heavy bags under my eyes, my hair's all messy.... it's not pretty. I've spent most of my time since 4PM today, just catching up with the internet world and friends. But I tell ya, if there ever was a more effective diet, this is it. It's like conscious hibernation, because... the game substitutes for the dreams and you do nothing. I tried playing standing up, but I found myself immediately wanting to sit. I wonder why it is, I cannot let a game go without having beaten it. I suppose I like closure. I know that I don't do well with books that have vague endings. I need to know what happens before the people die or spend the rest of their lives without event. Even though I physically saw my summer reading and drawings, I couldn't resist the gravitational pull of the video game. In any case, that was a nice little escape from reality. That's another thing (before I finish this train of thought): Sometimes, the screen would become like blinders, and everything around me just fastforwarded like in those movies where the people are walking slowly, while objects flash around them. Scary. At least with games like Monster Rancher, there's no real ending, and so I can sleep easily without the suspense. Okay, topic is dead. _The thing I was wanting to write about on the 16th was my career choice. I know I'm indecisive, and so for people to expect me to just come outright and choose (especially without having experienced a day-in-the-life) is too much to ask. But I know that "time is money" for the adult world, and it can't be wasted on dilly-dallying about considering all options. I just don't know if I would do well in the world of biology. I wanted to do something great, not for recognition, just to merely live life outside the norm. And as interesting as I find biology, I don't think a drive to learn more is enough to truly love a lifetime career. I had always expected to follow the stable (or so I thought) route and just keep drawing on the side as a hobby, but now, the more I consider it, I've seriously thought about changing my life path to something in graphic or digital arts. I know that it's difficult since there are not many scholarships for that kind of thing, but I can really see myself still drawing in thirty years... whereas, with biology, I'm still not even sure of exactly what it is I want in which to specialize. I've found virology and biology in general on a molecular and micro- level the most interesting. It's kind of scary to think that that future is so close. I'm running out of time. "Two roads diverge at a yellow wood," indeed.
