For the people who take the time to read and understand, I appreciate it :)  Anyways I wrote another one last night, I feel as if I am a machine. My cousin and her boyfriends relationship inspired me to write it. They care very deeply of each other, but the age difference bothers the family, and my cousin is struggling with the family finding out. Even through all of it, it works out for the best. Here it is, enjoy.   Love Survival   Frightening amusement; Cherishing the time. Living for the moment; And making you truly mine  Societal perspectives; Differ from my heart An everlasting commitment; Is letting itself start  Feeling your touch; Fills me with intensity I know that I love you; A sensual sensitivity  Frightened to move on; Too late to turn back Loving each other forever; We can do it, it's a fact  Until acceptance is granted; We stand here hand in hand Be by my side forever; And never let me strand  Â© 2004 Tyler Kuhk   And there you have it :). I should continue getting ready for work. I plan to go for coffee tonight, smoke-free too. Never done that before. We will see how it goes I suppose, eh? Take it easy everyone!  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site  |  urlLink My Poetry Portfolio
