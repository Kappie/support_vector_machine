I can't even read all of it, but I can see "Resistance", "Genocide" and "Liberate African People".  That alone is such an addicting idea, and the hand holding up the spears only adds to that.  It makes it almost understandable why such ideas as Nazism were able to catch on easily.  Coming to "defense" of your own people even if their is no problem, always has a strong calling.  I really need to get out more, and not take that damn AP Stat test....
