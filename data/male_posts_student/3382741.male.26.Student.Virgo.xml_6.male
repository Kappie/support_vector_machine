I almost wish I didn't know this.  when i asked him why he didn't call he only said 'I don't know'.  saying that i am not happy about it would fall short.  i sent him a couple texts today too ... and no replies (this is getting to be a normal thing).  if i am honest with myself I dont see this lasting much longer.  he just isn't showing any intrest in me right now ... this all started very suddenly last weekend when i went down to visit.  i could feel a change in him but i have no clue what or why and he insisted everything is ok.  well guess we will just see what happens.  i dont know why i am torturing myself with linux.  i think its to the point i that i cant quit just becuase that would mean it has beaten me again.  so now i am back to redhat (where i began).  i had made a lot more progress on it ... but now its not working like it did before.  it seems i missed a step somewhere.  ugh.  .... ok i have been working on it as i have been trying to write this and it seems i am getting somewhere ... lets hope anyway.  (Man I am such a nerd).  I have a rahter bad headache and it just keeps getting worse.  i am going to take some drugs and try to survive.  more later
