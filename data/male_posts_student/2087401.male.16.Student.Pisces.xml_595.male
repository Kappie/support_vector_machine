I'm going to be bored in Florida. You can read outside, but you can't write outside, and I'm going to get sunburned anyway, or return as pale as I am right now. I'll want to stay inside all the time, and my mom will make me go outside, and I'll be bored. And my brother will drive me crazy. In fact, by the time it's over, everybody in my family will be driving me crazy.  We still don't have our DSL back. I'm beginning to think it will be like the heat in Mr. Davis's room and we'll get it back only when we least expect it. In a few years. Sigh.
