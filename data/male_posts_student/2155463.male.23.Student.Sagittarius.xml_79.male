I'm running the gammut of summer jobs; so far I have applications out for legal positions (reseach or investigative), landscaping, roofing, UPS, and clerical/administrative.  So far, no takers (I've only had three people even call me back).    In case I didn't already hate it enough, my dumb Spanish class is causing a lot of problems finding someone who will go with my schedule; in a perfect world I would be able to work two or three days a week, intern with the Cleveland Public Defender a couple of days a week, and still get my Spanish class out of the way (fortunately, I don't have to make TOO much money this summer :).  And I have to admit it would be kinda nice to get a manual labor / outside job so I could get tan and a workout every day ;)  Ah well, at least there's still volleyball virtually every night, basketball in the EARLY morning (it's been SO wonderful being able to go play and then come back and go back to bed), and softball.  Now I just need to get good at one of them... :D
