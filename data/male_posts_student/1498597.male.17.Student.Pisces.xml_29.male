I think I might have been exposed to a small amount of radiation.  Is that whats makin' me tired?  Things are goin' a bit awry on my other blog,  "The Punk Rock Editorial" .  It seems that my previous blogs are in all bold, which i remember I never did.  There was also a spacing error in the most recent blog I posted on there.  Oh well, that shit better clear up and be how I customized it...I tried fixin' the damn thing, but it didn't change.  Is Blogger to blame?  Or maybe my not-worth-a-shit computer is responsible?  Well, I'm gettin' tired.  I dunno whether the food will get me energized or tempt the veil of sleep over my eyes.  Regardless, this is the last blog for the graveyard shift...Everyone is gone now, no one to talk to but myself again.  This is  JR.  signing off...
