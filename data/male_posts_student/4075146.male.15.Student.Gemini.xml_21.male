I came in around 9:30, as usual, and spent the next hour and a half making my poster board. The results had to be imported at the last minute (as I was unable to process them and make graphs until last night), I had to then come up with results, conclusions, discussion, and abstract sessions, which make absolutely no sense considering the fact that my results were extremely hasty and preliminary, devised solely for the purpose of satisfying the program. You can imagine how that turned out.  As for the results, I found pretty much nothing of importance. Besides the fact that very few tests were done (compared to what we will be doing eventually), I'm not sure about Mike's slowdown measurements--they are very wild, the class coalescing results especially. Unless some kind of sine function is controlling those slowdowns, the results seemed completely random. I'll check with him about those, as the accuracy of my results rely on the accuracy of his, and these just don't seem right. The type hiding results seem a lot better, although one of the slowdown times (I used six, from obfuscating 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 classes) is off of the standard, which does throw off my results a bit, as well. I guess this will have to be sorted out, eventually. Whenever "eventually" is--there are still quite a few metrics to be implemented, and then there is the tall order of obfuscating five programs, using three types of obfuscation, to all the different degrees, before measuring them all. I mean, nothing I couldn't do in a couple of days time, and I'm not trying to complain or anything, it's just...I seem to have lost the passion and the interest for this project that I had even two days ago. I don't know if it's the switch from programming to obfuscating/experimenting, or just the stress from all the unreasonable assignments this program is giving us that take the focus off the actual research (I suspect it's the latter, and I'll regain my interest in this project soon, now that the program is  finally  ending tomorrow), but I just want to take a break from all of this, and right not do not at all look forward to implementing more metrics and performing all of the experiments. But, as I said, this is probably only a temporary thing, I'm sure I'll be back to normal soon enough...I'm going away for a few days next week, I think I need it.  On to other news, I have a meeting next Friday at Columbia, with James Applegate, an astrophysics professor doing some fascinating research. I have no plans of quitting my current project, especially without any viable results, but I don't know if I'll want to expand the research. This summer, while utterly fascinating, just hasn't capitivated me like astrophysics does, and I'm now only more convinced than before that that is the direction I want to take. So anyway, I called this Professor Applegate today, having some free time after presenting to look through the Columbia astrophysics department website. I've decided to all but give up e-mailing professors as first contact in my search for a mentor this year. E-mail was my primary form of communication last year, and you can see where that got me. E-mailing Eric Gotthelf at Columbia got me nothing, not even a reply. Calling him got me a two hour meeting at the University. I'm convinced I can get a mentor this year, in astrophysics. Other students have done it in the past, so what prevents me from doing the same? Just my drive, I suppose, so it goes without saying what needs to happen in order o get a mentor now...  Anyway, I think I've dragged this on too long, assuming anyone even reads this to begin with. Just felt like pouring all of my thoughts out right now...I'll stay here for a bit, I can leave a little later today as I'm meeting my dad, aunt, and uncle in the city for dinner at 7 (this restaurant Maya, I've heard good things) and work on my program, and read...shalom!
