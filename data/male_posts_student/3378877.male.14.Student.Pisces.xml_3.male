I got weird compliments like :  "Caeleb you look nice today" - Erin  "Caeleb you know how to dress unlike other guys!" - Lauren  * I have good friends [haha] I guess they like me.  * Another issue that needs to be addressed is the fact of friends who are friends with friends but not friends with friends friends [does that make sense?]. Hannah is like obsessed with Mallory and Erin and she hates it when they hang out with me [what can i say i am so popular with the ladies]. No, i grew up with Mallory and yeah i have a lot of girlfriends, I cant date anyone in school [thats a girls {winks}] I am too good of friends with them all. Which kinda sucks but I can deal with it, I have secrets anyway that solve that problem.  * Kammer, he diffinately has some attatchment issues and i am not the only one seeing them. He is either obsessed with me and 'gay' or he is just trying to get in good with me so that he can get in good with Mal or Erin. I dont know.  Its not like its that hard for him to find someone to date. Even though I could prolly get a girl before him [haha].  * Graduations is coming up for our middle school, its going to be fun graduating but I always think about how its going to be hard being at the 'bottom of the food chain' again. I may be the most popular guy in school but thats only because i am easy to get along with. That is all going to change in highschool, i can feel it. I REALLY HOPE AND PRAY that no one will forget who they are and change into something they arent. Like Jennifer. Which brings me to my other issue.  * Jenn, she is just going to keep doing 'pot' and everything and its going to take a toll on her body soon. I know it, she comes to school drowsing sometimes and I talk about it but she just says:  " you ever just think i am tired, Caeleb?"  * Well Jenn, if you didnt do 'pot' so often then I wouldnt have to 'assume'. Oh well, what can i do other than see how it plays out. I told her that if her grades ever start to fall [because she is a very intelligent girl] then I would tell her parents, because I would know then that her brain was being messed with. She said that she would hate me and love me at the same time [haha]. Is that possible? I know what she means, and I could care less if she hated me because I know that I did the right thing. [love you Jenn!]  * Well thats all for tonight, WOW i wrote a lot. Wait until tomorrow [HAHA].   Stay Tuned!   * kd
