Linda phoned me, but i didn't know. my sister told me,"haha, that girl called you again! she must love you!" at that time, i really wanted to say:" she loves me for sure and so do i!" haha Linda said she wrote a letter, but she earased it. @#$*^@!@#$^)^$#$#$# how could she do that!!!! but she told me what she had written.  (she had asked me colorest(she said) question. that is "have you ever thought about going to bed with me?")  she said, we would have a large house. there would be a large large window. before going bed, i'd stand behind her and hold her. we together look at the beautiful starry night sky.    (one of my favourite paintings)  actually,i have ever thought about that scene. we sleep on a large bed looking at starry sky through transparent glass ceiling.i hold her hand putting on my body. i'd kiss her deeply then say "i love you" i would hold her tightly! that's life. that is eternity!!!!! it's late.i have got to sleep! god bless!
