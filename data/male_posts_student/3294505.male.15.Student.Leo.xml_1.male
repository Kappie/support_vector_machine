How's everyone been, those few of you who check in on my blog every now an' then? Hopefully good.   The few people who I talk to at school I've finally spent a second to get to know even a little bit, reducing my anti-sociality. Which is good, to an extent. I still dont like many people I talk to right off, which I definately think should be improved....  A lil example of how could probably be this one chick, who liked me, and I did, but very little. Nothing went on, thank god, because for some reason I know, but don't at the same time [hard to explain]-- I can't stand talking to her for more than 3 seconds. That's probably going similarly for her, in which I wouldnt mind so much if I  did  have a shard of compassion and conscience within me. I openly show her how I cant stand her, but at the same time I feel bad, because if I wasn't such an ass I'd be in on being her friend. Hopefully this summer break'll ease that, so I can go back to school and be nice to her for the short amount of time she claims she'll be there...make up for my assholery. Confusing?   On a totally different side of things, my  urlLink friend  , who may or may not have mentioned it as you read this, told me about a new technology aiming to replace CD's and DVD's. It's called  urlLink Info-MICA , and it's about the size of a postage stamp. Definately something worth checking out if you're into that kinda thing.   Well, I don't have much else to talk about, for now. I can hear your sighs of relief as you read that. Heheh.
