And all my teachers, sinagadsagad ang oras!!  Up to the last minute, they were overloading us students with terms, definitions, formulas, and problems.. by afternoon, I was not in the mood for critical thinking anymore.  My last subject, Math 27, was 4-5:30.. and man.. derivatives and integrals were ringing in my ears.. and my teacher's  "You can't do that.. it doesn't work that way.."  "Here's the trick.. now try this.."  every now and then really ticked me off. Usually, him saying that would amuse me.. but I was just so tired!  I tried my  best to literally keep my eyes open, listen and watch him do the mathematical wonder on the board, and copy everything I needed to copy.  I was like "tama na, sir!"  And instead of letting us go thirty minutes early, he kept us in class up to the last minute.  Eventually, I got back to the dorm still alive (tsk, exag) and up for my last appointment for the day - cell meeting.  I so wanted to sleep.  At least, my roommate Sheilla went with me and we had an okay time.  One thing Ate Laida, a cell leader said, was that life is like a basketball game.. and those times with God and with his people are like time outs.. time to huddle and encourage, teach, and help each other.   LJ!!! Can I post in your xanga now?  'Haven't read the link you posted yet. hihi:)
