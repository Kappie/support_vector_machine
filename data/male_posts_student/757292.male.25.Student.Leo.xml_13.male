Basically she and I are flirting in a major way, but neither of us is totally revealing our true intent or emotions. It's frustrating in one sense, but incredibly joyous and fun the next. Although I know it's a dream, the whole experience is one of the most fun-filled moments I can remember.  Painfully though, I look for her latest online manifestos and get disappointed when the "he" being mentioned isn't a reference to me.
