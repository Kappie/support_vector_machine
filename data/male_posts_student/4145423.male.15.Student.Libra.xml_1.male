I think I should keep this for a while and see how it goes..maybe I'll like it.  Anyone can comment now; you don't have to be a registered user. I could also make this blog my homepage :-)  We shall see in the near future...  Well, also, rain (from earlier) kept me home today (no program). I'm not going tomorrow either (doctor appointment), so that really sucks. Two full days of community service (for school), five days home. I don't seem to like free time anymore...
