Besides, do you want truth or entertainment?  I thought so.              The beacon of human intelligence, it has guided us and has lit the path of mankind for ages.  It is the light that keeps us safe and warm, but light casts shadows.  Most people can ignore what lies in those shadows always walking on the well lit path, and some just don’t believe that the shadows are even there.  But I believe.  I believe with a fire that has threatened to consume me time and time again, and the fire must be fueled.             I had learned much.  I had learned to feel my own soul, I had learned to see from my third eye, and I had even learned to touch the currents of ethereal force; but it was never enough.  I had to have more.  I searched every source I could think of, wading through text after worthless text; trying to find a diamond in the shit.  Every book I read was useless, filled with half truths and lies made up to fill in those extra 200 pages.  Damn the person who thought of paying by the word.  I sought out others who shared my passion, but one person can only listen to so many crystal wavers, Neo-Satanists, hippie moon maidens, and yuppie fung shui masters unlocking their ultimate potential at Ikea before they lose all faith in humanity, and I hadn’t started out with much anyway.             I began to spend more and more time inside my own head.  I would walk long distances with my eyes closed; relying on my own extremely limited clairvoyant abilities.  I would completely shun my mundane studies; spending my time forcing images out of crystals, and tracing patterns in smoke.  The team effort of the uselessness of those around me and my own blatant lack of ability was deeply infuriating, something which only further hindered my focus.  I redoubled my efforts, whipping myself, pushing myself much farther than I should have.  The tension became too much for my mind.  I would never admit it to myself, but I could feel my sanity gradually slipping under the pressure.             I went off on another of my solitary walks.  I found myself gazing at the moon; it was full and high above me.  I was pushing my mind outwards, trying to sense my connection to the source.  I pushed myself harder, forcing myself out of my body.  My Chakras flared, my Parana flowed and somewhere in my mind a voice began to scream a cry of warning to those who have already damned themselves.  With steadfast arrogance and reckless power lust I ignored it, and pushed even harder.  The scream rose to a fevered pitch, quickly passed though howl, then wail, and soon put crescendo to shame.  This primeval roar from the depths of my fevered mind culminated in one note, one sound which pulled you back just long enough for you to see all the mistakes you had made, and then thrust you violently over the edge. Snap.             I passed the next block, walking into the nexus of 4 streets, and stood on the edge of the crossroads, watching in awe and horror as I walked to edge across from me, and the edge to my left, and the edge to my right.  My thoughts raced  what is this?  Your ultimate self is manifesting itself! No it’s not my ultimate self, my ultimate self is only one person.  But when you’ve pierced the seal you can bend the rules, so you could just bend the rule of singularity.  It they were me I could control them; we both know I’m trying and they don’t react. Wait, what’d he just say?   A familiar voice rolled forth.  My voice.             “We’re here to stop you Max.”             “You can’t keep doing this.”             “It’s going to kill you.”  My voice flowed again, but this time I was the one controlling it.             “What the hell are you guys talking about?”             “Your minds collapsing.”             “You can’t keep trying to reach for things that aren’t there”             “Accept it Max. It’s all a lie.”  My words were too much to accept.  I could refute them when anyone else said them, but if even I don’t have faith in my beliefs…  My mind lunged into excuses mode, seeking pretty words to pad my failing ego.    No, it can’t be.  They’re lying, this is some kind of trick another daemon, it can’t all be lies, I’ve got proof, and I’ve done these things.  The tarot couldn’t have just been a coincidence, I can feel it in my soul, I know it can be a lie.  It just can’t be.              “It is Max, Face it.”  Hah.  Hah!  Oh for the web we weave phantom max.  You’ve fallen into your own trap this time.  Those fools are even blinder than I.              “If it’s all a lie, then how did you know what I was thinking?  Seems to me your faith in psychics is pretty weak for a Mind Reader.”             “Come on Max your smarter than this, you should’ve figured this out by now.  We know your thoughts because they’re ours too, look at us!  We’re you!”   Fuck, I’m one clever son of a bitch.  Now how the hell am I gonna outsmart myself.              “Every plan you make we can see, have you truly already forgotten that we share your thoughts?”             “We’re trying to help you Max, your hallucinating”             “You’re drowning in your own illusions.”   Hallucinating?  What if they’re right, what if this has all been one big dream, one big lie?              “It is.  This is all just another dream.”   It’s a dream?              Something slid into position, and the magic switch clicked in my head.  This is a dream.  This is my dream.  This is  My World .  I has just seen the obvious answer and suddenly realized how stupid I was.  A happy, borderline giddy laugh bubbled up from within me.  It was a light, relieved, almost whimsical laugh.  When they spoke next a new note rang in their voice, it was the telltale wavering of uncertainty.             “What are you laughing at?”             “Can’t read my mind anymore, can you, FUCKER!”  Panic rushed across their faces.  I took control.  I spun down to face the one on my left, as my trenchcoat swirled I pulled from within a shotgun, double barrel.  Hey, it’s my dream, if I want there to be a shotgun there then by hell I’m putting one there.   Blam!  He collapsed as a perforated corpse.  I flipped the gun over my shoulder so that I was holding it upside down pointing it behind me.   Blam!   I didn’t even need to look to see if I had hit.  I’m not going to go through the trouble of materializing a shotgun that can miss, come on, that would be just stupid.  I stood up and walked slowly towards my remaining foe.  It was the slow steady walk of an action movie hero, flashy and dramatic.  I was really enjoying this now.  I flicked my weapon effortlessly; the barrel flew up, spun an impossible number of times and dropped perfectly onto my hand, snapping open as two more shells that were on my belt locked into place.  True, that was unnecessarily and almost disgustingly over dramatic, but I don’t get to walk around in a dream world where I'm an omnipotent force very often, and I’ve seen way to many Vin Diesel movies.  I held the gun forth along the length of my arm, pausing just long enough to perfectly relish my triumph.  The shot rang out into the night, and once again I was alone.   Ok, back to reality.  Do we have to? Yes. Damn.   I closed my eyes, and when I opened them I was still on the edge of that street, the moon hadn’t moved an inch.  Not a second had passed.  I kept walking, went home and never mentioned it to anyone.  All as though it had never happened, and in many ways it hadn’t
