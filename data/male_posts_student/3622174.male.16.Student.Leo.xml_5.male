GameRankings, which is owned by GameSpot, is the site to go to if you’re looking for specific information on a game, including archives of what media outlets have reviewed it.  You can also check out screenshots of the games that you are interested.     urlLink    The main page for GameRankings shows games that are most popular, and the recent top games. urlLink     If you want to leave your input on games, you have to sign up.  Signing up for the site takes only a second, and you don’t have to do too much to do it.  Just fill out one little form, and you’re all set to go.  You can rate the games that you have bought, which will show up on the “Reader Reviews” section, which can be found at the bottom right of every game’s page.  You can get in-depth with the results.  It will tell you how it ranks on a specific console (for example, The Chronicles of Riddick is the 12th best game on the Xbox, according to various retailers who reviewed the game, and had their reviews archived on GameRankings).  It will tell you how it ranks in the history of games.  (For example, Halo might be #12 or something like that).    The cool thing about GameRankings is that there is so much user interaction.  Everyone who votes on a game, they will have their vote displayed in the “User Voting” column, which is where the Reader Reviews column is.  In big, bold letters, it will show the Users Rating for the game.  (Right now, Spiderman 2 is a 7.4.  Shocker.  The media outlets that reviewed it are giving it As, 95s, and 87s, or something like that).  The user interaction is also helpful when determining what games are better.  You can browse through the library of games for each console by clicking on that console’s icon.  The recent games list tells you what has just recently come out, and how it is faring in the media compared to other games.    Like I mentioned earlier, you can look at screenshots of the game.  This is helpful, so that you can see what game you are going to buy, before you buy it and say it looks a lot like crap.     urlLink    You can check out screenshots of the games you're looking for. Ah...good ol' Spidey. urlLink     Overall, GameRankings is a fast site, and it’s a good one, too.  It’s a helpful tool for finding out more information on a game, and getting different sites’ opinions on it.  However, there are tons of members of the message board that will flame a good game just to bring its score down.  I give GameRankings.com an impervious  4 out of 5.
