I brought my camera, but as my luck, they were prohibited. Imagine that. I had to walk all the way back to the vehilce. When I got through, I seen a couple people with camera and I asked how they got in. He was their response "I put it in my pocket. Nobody cares anyway." I found that to be true when someone asked a security officer to take a picture of them. He happily did.  We'll that's about it for now. See ya around! @@Eric@@
