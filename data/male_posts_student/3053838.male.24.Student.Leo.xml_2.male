It is such a privilege to come before You in prayer to bring our needs before You. Even before we tell You of our desires, You already know them. You just want us to come before You in faith and ask according to Your will.    Lord, the state of the world today is so terrible and it must really break Your heart to see us like that. It seems as if we are helpless in trying to right all the wrongs but our strength is in You. I bring before You the drug situation all over the world. Humans are persisting in their sinful ways and harming themselves and the people around them. I pray that the effort that people are making to increase the awareness of the perils of taking drugs will be fruitful.    But even more importantly is not their physical state but their spiritual one. Lord, I pray that You send more workers in the harvest to reach out to the lost. The harvest is plenteous but the labourers are few. Send forth your workers into the fields to harvest those souls who are ready to be saved. True change can only happen when Your Holy Spirit indwells in them to change from within. To change out of their love for You.    Lord, do what man cannot do. Touch hearts today and bring them into Your kingdom. I commit this day unto You and pray that You do all that is in accordance to Your will and Your timing. I pray all these in the name of Jesus, Amen.
