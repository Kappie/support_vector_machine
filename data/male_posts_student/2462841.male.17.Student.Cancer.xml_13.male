The fact that its willing to  urlLink openosurce its installer toolkit  means that it either:   A: likes the opensource idealogy   B: Is sick of being the mean proprietary company   C: Wants to use the opensource community to help it build a better product (business driven)   From Microsofts history, I would choose C, but I feel they might have actually changed so the reason could even be A. Even so I still love my gentoo box.
