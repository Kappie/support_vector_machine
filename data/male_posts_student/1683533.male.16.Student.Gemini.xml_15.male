Maybe it's the medication I am on...or maybe I am just heading to better times...  For those who don't know, I hit an extreme low spot in late may-early june....it was alot of things....then I just blew up cause the stress was too much, and i threatened to hurt myself.... I went into therapy, and just a couple weeks ago I was started on Zoloft (an anti-depressent) and I also switched therapists (the first one wanted to send me to a mental hospital *sweatdrop*).  I got a new therapist...a young guy that went thru a divorce himself, so he can relate to alot of issues I am having...and he also plays guitar like me!  The only problem I hit so far was last week....I hit that low again...and I got close to doing something really stupid...now I am more chipper than ever it seems....but I still feel like myself...which is great because I was afraid the meds would make me feel like I wasn't myself...  well...i thought I would just get that out that....I just hope I don't hit anymore low spots....it seems it's all easy sailing from here...
