I went to bed before midnight mainly because I was tired and felt sick.  That along with the fact that I didn't have anything to do!  I was bored all night.  Today sucked.  I sat around all day being sick.  What a way to spend the first day of a new year :-(  Oh well.  I did play some Xbox and played a little pool online with Whit.  That was fun at least!  :-)  Tomorrow my brother leaves for South Carolina and the last few days of basic training.  Then he graduates and moves to California for his year of language training.  I wish him the best!  I don't have anything else to say.  Night.
