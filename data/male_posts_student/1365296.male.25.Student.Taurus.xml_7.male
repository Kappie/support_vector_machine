Despite the lackluster trailer, however, I'm so excited about this trilogy.  Its about time it was released on DVD.  One can only hope that it took so long because Lucas wanted to make sure he could unleash the movies in their best quality.  Needless to say, Star Wars was made for DVD.  Its one of those movies that you simply can't slap onto a disk and distribute.  It needs to be applied to the DVD format with care.  It appears as though Lucas has taken extra special care, and this is a good thing.  I can't wait.
