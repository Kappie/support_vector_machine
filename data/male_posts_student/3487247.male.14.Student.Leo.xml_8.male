Confessions, Pt. 2  6. Burn  7. Caught Up  13. That's What It's Made For  14. Can U Handle It?  15. Do It to Me   The album opens with thefirst single "Yeah",featuring  urlLink Ludacris , and fromthere on presentsthe listener with a plethora of potential singles. From the meaty hip-grinding licks on "Caught Up", to the funky 70s rub on both "Throwback" (complete with loops and backing vocal samples from  urlLink Dionne Warwick ) and the  urlLink Harold Melvin  sampling "Take Your Hand."  As the title implies thatthis is an autobiographical album, and the lyrics seehim glide from the sexually charged ("That's What It's Made For" and "Can U Handle It?") to the almost embarassingly personal. On "Confessions Part II" he tells his lover 'I'm having a baby by a woman I barely even know', while "Truth Hurts" may well have significant meaning to Ms Thomas. Is it mere theatre or is he really putting his cards on the table?  Ultimately it doesn't matter. The jury isin and the record buying public have voted with their hard-earned cash. It's scary to think that its now ten years since the 14-year old first made his mark on the r scene. Yet four albums later, in the wake of multi-platinum sells, he's matured from a teen pop star to a sultry rb singer of considerable substance.
