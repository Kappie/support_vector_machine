I could go no further, I was blocked.  After a couple minutes of this blockage, a single leaf fell from a tree somewhere around me and it landed right on my knee.  Suddenly the wrote freely again.  I felt very much at peach.  It was kind of like a quick "hello" from God, and Him saying, "thanks for thinking of Me, here's a little something to remind you that I'm thinking of you."  ...Thank you, God.
