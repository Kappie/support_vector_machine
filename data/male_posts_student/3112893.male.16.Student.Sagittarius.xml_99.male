I am the rhythm guitar (the one that comes in first) and he's the fancy-shmancy melody guy who does the stuff I can't do yet. I'm learning though :-). Oh, and please forgive me for messing up a bunch of times through out the tune on the strumming pattern. Anyway, post guesses in the comments. Ah, that reminds me, apparently people have no idea what they're listening for, so I'll give you a hint.    urlLink
