The software giant said the new system, named Windows XP Starter Edition, would go on sale in Asia in October. The company said the cut-price software was designed for "first-time desktop PC users in developing countries".      Competitive threat      Analysts say Linux poses a growing threat to Microsoft's dominant Windows operating system, used on more than 90% of the world's computers.       A so-called 'open source' system which PC users can install on their machines and modify without paying a license fee, Linux has made significant inroads into the software market in Latin America and Asia.      Earlier this year, computer giant HP began shipping computers equipped with Linux to China and India.       Linux is also championed by Microsoft critics who say the firm's dominance of the global software market makes computer systems more vulnerable to potentially disabling viruses. Microsoft's new software - dubbed "XP Lite" - will feature lower resolution graphics and limited options for networking computers together.           Microsoft said it hoped the new software would also help deter consumers from buying pirated versions of its XP system, widely available in many Asian countries.
