I'm just at a point in my life where everything I do is pointless (heh) and that I can't find the joy of stuff anymore.  I mean, I pick up a video game and ready to have fun and whatnot but all I do is press buttons randomly hoping for a good outcome.  I pick up my pencil read to do some math homework but all I get is confused by the buttons of the calculator.  I have the phone in my hand and I'm ready to call some of my friends but I just don't for some odd reason.  Maybe I should take a break.  I mean, there are a couple of things that I still like to do.  For instance, I still like to talk to you.  You're a cool guy, no matter what you say.  I still like to take walks (but since there's no one to walk with me, I seldom do).  I like to cook (but since I have not the time)  I dunno.  I don't have such an active social life as you think.  Its funny how your e-mail came to me today.  I thought I had an okay social life yesterday.  But after today, I just realized that I don't.  Well, not just today, I had a feeling that I wasn't the most socially active person for a long time now.  I found out that some of my friends are going to baseball games and concerts without ever once thinking of inviting me.  Even though all of my efforts in the past where to include everyone I could think of in my outings.  Yet, no one mentions a concert that I would like to attend.  No one would even think of asking me.  I think it has to do with an incident a couple of years ago when someone asked me to go to a concert and I made some lame excuse not to go because I didn't have the money back then and I never like to borrow money from my parents.  I made some lame excuse like, "I don't like concerts" or something like that.  And I guess they still believe that and don't even bother to invite me to anymore.  Sometimes thinking about it, it almost makes me tear up.  Its not even something so superficial as going to a concert.  I just want to be talked to and invited to things like I invited other people to things.  And there are a couple of concerts that I would love to go to but no one would go with me because they're too busy doing other things.  Today was just mentally exhausting.  After having been slapped in the face by the fact that I was excluded from such trivial yet important things like concerts and baseball games, I get slapped in the face again for being average in every single thing I do.  I hate whining to people.  But this has just been bugging me.  I'm not the smartest person in the class.  I'm not the greatest violinist in the orchestra.  I wasn't the fastest soccer player.  I'm not the best of anything.  Just average or slightly above.  But whats worse is that sometimes I grow to hate the people who are better than me.  Maybe not hate, but feel intensely jealous.  And that really sucks because thats a bad feeling.  Then I connect the state of being average to my problem with not being invited to places.  Then I think that maybe because of me being just a regular person that no one really takes notice of me enough to take me places.   I don't think I've had arguements with my friends.  But I can just never have a good conversation with them anymore.  Its not their fault but whenver I talk to them, they'll tell me about the stuff they do all the time.  Like how they need a new drum set because their band is doing a gig at some place.  Or how this person went to a tri-county whatnot with their orchestra.  I mean, I feel happy for them and stuff but I just feel left out.  Why can't I be in those things?  Oh wait, I know, because I'm insanely average.  Fuck.  Its not like I want to keep things from you.  So far, I've been honest and open.  I wouldn't decline any question directed towards me.  I don't think you're going to molest me (nerds aren't strong, right?)  Just kidding.  I'm just over-thinking things and being anal about everything (for a lack of a better phrase).  Popularity escapes my grasp, but yet it is so close that I can touch it sometimes.  It'll be cool to meet sometime.  It wouldn't be bad because we could meet again some other time after the initial meet.  I mean, its not like right after our meeting one of us will go off into war and never been heard from again.  I know that our meeting will not be bad because I know that we will continue to talk again.  Even if not through chat, then through e-mail.  I once had a penpal (online penpal) from Germany.  This nice girl about my age when I was about 13 or 14 years old.  We used to exchange e-mail letters everyday without fail.  She was so human.  She had flaws and she had strengths.  We had so many conversations and I learned so much stuff about Germany.  German word and phrases and foods.  But at the end of our time exchanging e-mail, something happened to her.  She was sent to the hospital for some sort of testing.  And I never really heard from her again.  I felt so bad and lonely.  You know?  All this time, two years or so, we spent e-mailing each other, and for her to just cut off so suddenly without a goodbye or anything, it just broke me.  And to think it, we never even chatted real time.  There was no IM'ing.  But it just ruined me.    The moral.  Well, not really a moral.  More of a transitition to this paragraph.  Matt.  If we are to continue talking, then you should some sort of promise or pact or whatever that you won't disappear to Japan without a goodbye or if not a goodbye then a pact/promise/whatever that you'll still continue writing.  The little girl in Germany managed to write to the little boy in America.  You could do the same in Japan.  I don't know what the future holds and I don't expect that much from the future.  Maybe we will meet.  And maybe not.  I sure hope we do.  I like to meet the person who is responsible for keeping me from so many assignements, papers, projects, and masturbation sessions.  Yea, too much information, I know.  The last one was for ha'ha's.  Anyway.  I'm going to Tahiti no matter what.  Its your choice whether or not you want to come with me.  The end.  Dennis.
