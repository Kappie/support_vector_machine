While I've spoken quite well of Alfonzo Cuaron's  urlLink Y Tu Mama Tambien , I have to say that  Talk To Her  just took the cake as my favorite film of the past year.  Possibly ever.  And that's not just because  urlLink Leonor Watling  did an amazing job as Alicia, besting her landmark role from  urlLink Behind God's Back , where she won the world's heart with her characterization of  the First Prostitute.  I don't know what it is about spanish-language films, but three of my five favorite films of all-time fall in the catergory:   urlLink Y Tu Mama Tambien ,  urlLink All About My Mother , and  Talk To Her .  I've always thought fondly of foreign film; not just foreign language, but British and Irish fare as well, though  urlLink Guy Ritchie  films don't really do it for me.  I'm trying to put a foreign spin on my independent-style writings, and finding it quite difficult to do...living in America, a screenwriter rebelling against Syd Field doesn't get much love.  But who cares?  Fuck Syd Field (btw, for anyone interested in starting a website, www.fucksydfield.com is still available).    Is my writing fresh?  For example, my most recent publication, seen by over 200,000 in Austin this week:   Oat Willie's Discount Tobaccanist Supply Store .  You:  girl searching for La Bomba pleasure toy; interested in using it for purposes other than smoking.  Me:  customer curious as to why Oat Willie chose those boxers.  I pointed you to the Ritchie Valens section at Waterloo; you laughed as a favor to my ego.  Why is a girl like you resigned to plastics?   Coffee sometime ?  Maybe if it was in Spanish...
