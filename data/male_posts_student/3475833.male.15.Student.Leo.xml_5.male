Yeah Yeah, I know what you're thinking. Doesn't EVERYBODY have a blog now. Well, Now I do too. So, Shut up and sit down.  Now, This will probably ramble a whole lot. But that's why we call it the Abyss Of Words. Notta lot to say right now. Oh, Just: If I offend you. Then I'm sorry. These are my words. Straight from my heart. To quote MTV: you think you know, but you have no idea. This is the diary of Jeremy Hirschfelt.  Haha. That made me laugh. Welp... I'ma finish this up... Read, then hit the sack. I'm reading a GREAT book right now. It's called Bloody Bones, by Laurell K. Hamilton. Mmm, I love this author... Her new book comes out in October!
