I've kind of forgotten I have a blog and thanks to Ben and Nigel for reminding me to do it.  So what happened today in school? Nothing very much... But the part about the class vase being filled with urine was gross but kind of hilarious. :)  I skipped the SONY science experiment thingy cos I had tuition. Now I'm doing my new site,  http://academiaveritatis.netfirms.com/ Do visit it!
