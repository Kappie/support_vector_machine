Chorus: I take one step away Then i find myself coming back to you My one and only, one and only you...Ooh...  Now I know  That I know not a thing at all Except the fact that I am yours And that you are mine  Ooh  They told me that this wouldn't be easy And know  I'm not one to complain...  (Chorus 2X)  you..
