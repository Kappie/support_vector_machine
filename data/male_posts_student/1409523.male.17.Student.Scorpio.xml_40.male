EVERYONE else goes to school.... why am i the only who feels that school has been robbing me of my childhood and teen years.... instead spitting back some shitty mixed up life where sleep depravity and mental breakdowns are so frequent it seems im not living at all... just suffering... floating through a sad stressful day that i never wanted to begin in the first place... ok.... thats it ...enough for today.... i feel a little better.... off to swing for a shitty concert where everyone will smile and tell me how good i am and pretend that they actually care
