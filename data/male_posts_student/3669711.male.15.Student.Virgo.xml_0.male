What do a movie with a good storyline, a good way of telling the story, lots of exciting action, a hot girl, a guy with 8 limbs ironicly named 'Doc Ock', and a guy in a suit with spiders plastered over it?  A good movie!  Especially if that movie has the suffix '2' after the title.  Yes thats right, spiderman 2 was a good movie, even if you aren't into the whole 'Marvel Superhero' thing.    I can recall when i heard about the first spiderman movie... i didn't think much of it, because i wasn't so much of a spiderman fan at the time.  Sure, i had watched the cartoon several times, and more or less read a comic book or two, but i was never really a 'fan'.  I didn't see the movie when it first came out, i didn't even see it when it came to DVD and VHS.  I waited untill just last summer to see it.  I have to say, i was impressed.  So impressed that i went out and bought the DVD for a very expensive price of $32.99.    When i saw the commercials for Spiderman 2, i was very much impressed.  It looked better than the first one!  And indeed, it matched up to those high standards.  It used a bit more story building this time around, and had the same moderate bits of action.  The villan was a bit cooler too.    Well, that is what i think about spiderman 2.  The final verdict (all verdicts are final) 2 thumbs up for spiderman 2! ^_^   Lates
