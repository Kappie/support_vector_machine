We had to walk great distances (actually, a same long road 4 times. Quite hard to explain here...). We also brought 1kg of melon seeds. Eee...kinda mouldy, some of them. Most are quite okay though.  HaHa. I came back at 10 and I immediately went off to the Metro interview. It wasn't quite hard to locate Tower B. The receptionist didn't believe that I am 16. she said "Why aren't you in school?" I said I graduated le, took my Os last year and all. She then told me that the staff is not here today. Wasted my time man. HaHa.  I came home just in time to eat my lunch (fried rice) and go to the ICA (last time used to be the SIR building) to make IC. My brother's. I just brought my OotP along and read and read and read. After IC-making, we went to Whampoa to eat the heavenly duck porridge. Hmmmm!  I came back, read more OotP and fell asleep promptly at 3.30 on the sofa. I was so damn tired. What did I dream? Yeah. I dreamt that 2 thieves (which include a heavyset woman....almost Hagrid-like, actually) came into our house brazenly. They came to steal my brother's computer. Something about valuable info in ther (they input the info in....something like that la). Before I know it, hours passed, they left. The house was in a mess. I called the police, they refuse to come ("Put down the phone!! They are gonna kill you if they know you are calling us!"). Then, my brother woke me up at 5. He's informing me that he's going to his friend's house. HaHa. I continued sleeping some more until the sound of vaccum woke me up (father's vaccum). I also fell back asleep (see how tired I was?) then miraculously woke up just before 7 to watch Ben Yue. I slept for about 3.5 hours ba...ha!  Ben Yue was great. I loved the part where XiHe was killed by the Emperor and FuXi. So good! So sad the sotry between Chang'e and Huo Yi... star-crossed lovers, they are. Moo meow! I also ate my dinner while watching.  Hmm... nothing to say le hor? Okaylor...I gotta go le la. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
