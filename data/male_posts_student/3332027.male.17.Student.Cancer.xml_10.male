I want to tell him that I understand that I'm clingy and that pushes him away. I want to tell him that I'm improving with my flaws and that I understand. I think it scares him that I have a lot of emotions. When I'm around with other people that I'm not clsoe with, I seem like the happy, go-lucky, naive, and carefree person. To people it looks like I'm just loveless and being single is the best. They also see that I'm not relationship material. The truth is, I'm not happy. I want a relationship with someone special, someone unique. I want a relationship with him. We tried and it didn't work out. If I ever wanted to have a second chacne, it would be with him. He's a special person and it hurts to go day by day knowing that I'm not with him in that way. I want him to look in his heart and mine to see that maybe it's worth a second try. I don't want to regret not trying. I don't want to be thinking of all the what if's. He makes me happy and I want another chance to make him as happy as I am. He makes me feel wanted and i want to make him feel the way I feel, the feeling of warmth and security to know that will always be there when we need eachother. I know that I have flaws and I worked hard to fix those. I want him to know that I'm ready to give it another go and I'll be better this time. I want to tell him all of that. But what if tells me that he doesn't want to talk to me or see me anymore because of what I said.    This is an excerpt from Mandy Moore ft. Jonathan Foreman - Someday We'll Know   "Someday we'll know why Sampson loved Deliah one day I'll go dancing on the moon someday you'll know that I was the one for you  I bought a ticket to the end of the rainbow I watched the stars crash in the sea if I could ask God just one question why aren't you here with me... tonight"   I guess this is one thing he won't ever know. Maybe he will find this post and read it.  Maybe he will think about it again. Or maybe I'll break one of these days and tell him.
