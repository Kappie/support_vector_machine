I tell people at work constantly not to use Windex - what do I use at home? Well, it's a mixture of Windex and laziness. That's going to change I think though. I've had one of those Tony Robbins revelatory moments - today is the first day of the rest of my life sort  of thing. That's all well and good. Tomorrow is the day I get my car fixed. Hopefully it's just the belt.   My dad's buddy Steve has a virus on his computer (doesn't everyone?) that he needs removed. Steve's a cop. I thought about doing that for a while. I'm a fair guy and I've always wanted a gun... I think that disqualifies me from the position. My propensity for road rage is usually driven by the discourteous. I'd probably get frustrated with the job if I weren't allowed to bust punks for being less than polite to me or those around me. Then again, this coming from the guy who wants to kill his neighbors for allowing his children to run screaming up and down the stairs at 8 Am... well, I suppose that could be taken as a type of discourtesy.  I don't want to be sick for Halloween. That's kind of depressing me. But I refuse to be depressed today. The sun is shining through my window and that's got to be a positive thing, right? Yeah, it's about time I got some pants on me. And now that my monitor's clean, I desperately need to clean my glasses. That's better. Thoroughly pantsed, but no glasses goop in sight. I don't dare use Windex, cause, hey, "eyeball on the floor" is not the game for me.   I think I'm going to have to close those blinds a bit, or at the very least find some sunglasses. The sun's shining in my window like it hates me.  Why is it that I enjoy talking to one, maybe two (okay maybe a few more) people online and the rest seem to be trying to get the better of me, get one up on me or are generally being pricks?   Okay, enough whinging. I've got to get some work done. I think I'm going to go out and by the joy of cooking and actually plan this week's meals. I'm going to need supplies. Potatoes, Broccoli... I'm thinking maybe a nice battered fried chicken... or maybe I'll grill it. I'm excited about cooking. Now all I need is a dining room table.
