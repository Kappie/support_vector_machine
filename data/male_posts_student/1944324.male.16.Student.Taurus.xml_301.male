Rules of the shame hat: It is worn until you post a post with atleast a hundred DIFFERENT words.  It would have just been until you post, but Nate and Sophia made me add the qualifiers.  There are instances wherein you can not wear the hat, such as the shower or while eating or praying or while the National Anthem is being played.  But generally, wear the hat.  If Marten reports to me that you are not wearing the hat we will devise stronger punishments. Now, match-up time!  Results of the last match:  It was cancelled on account of rain and will be rescheduled to late 2005.  New match:  A super-intelligent toothpick vs Alex Trebeck's hair in a competition to see who can take over the world first.  The only rules are no Microsoft and no Easy Cheese. Now, onto business:     I have nothing to say.  Thank you
