That word is: Kawaii!!  Azumanga must have been the cutest anime i have ever watched!  I laughted so much, my dad had to tell me to shut up.  It's not only mindless comedy either, it's also very heart warming at parts.   When my friend first told me about it, he said it was quite random.  That sort of turned me off of it, and i didn't really watch it much when i first got it.  But, when you think about it, even thought each episode is a surprise, it does all add up to one big story.   Azumanga is basicly about the daily lives of six girls:  Chiyo chan (the genious), Sakaki san (the athlete who likes cute things), Yumi (the one who thinks shes fat), Tomo (the energetic one), Osaka (the clueless one), and Kagura (the second athletic one).  Not only does it follow just their daily lives, but it shows their lives right through highschool, from sophomore year (please accept my spelling) to senior year.   If you have the chance, see this anime, it's my second most favourite anime, next to the beloved Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien.  You WILL enjoy this series!  Lates
