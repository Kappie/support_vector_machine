Even if the world is painted as a big mural right in front of you, a child will only run close up to the painting and see what's in front of him only. It may be just a small part depicting some warmth and joy, but that's all it matters to a child. There's only so much, so far a child may be able to see. As you grow up, you learn to step back, and see the bigger picture. That's when your eyes are opened and you start shifting your focus to other parts of this art, and realize that there are so many different feelings depicted in a single mural. Much more things have happened every year since the turn of the century, and that forms the sorrow, burden and pains of the picture. Sometimes i wish i never grow up; but i know that i get more strength from God each day as i step a step further back to view this mural of life.  -Adapted from Zeslene's Blog, which was adapted from elsewhere-
