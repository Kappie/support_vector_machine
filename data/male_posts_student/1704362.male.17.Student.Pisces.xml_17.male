It's the kind of hot that a kind, just and loving god would not allow on this earth. Especially if you don't have air conditioning, like me.   Anyway, i'm back from camp. Besides getting exposed to harmful radiation, i also got a fire ant trapped in my shoe for half an hour. Ouch.  End Transmission.
