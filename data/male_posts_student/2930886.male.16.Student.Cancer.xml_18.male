I wonder how you would respond to this classic moral dilema: John walks into a village and finds Mary holding 15 people hostage. Mary says that she will kill them all unless John takes a gun and kills one of the hostages. All the hostages are innocent people with families. What should John do.  Randy Cohen the Ethicist replied:  What kind of business are you preparing your students for? Microsoft?   Thats all I feel like posting today but hey maybe tommorow
