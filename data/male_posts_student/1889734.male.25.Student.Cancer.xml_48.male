I pray every night that Howard Dean gets the nomination, since I think he will pretty much lead his party into the wilderness.  Other than his invention of subterranean elastic pavement, he has little to offer except for Anger.  I don't think you can effectively campaign under the banner of Anger, but it would be fun to watch.  Hillary, I admit, scares the hell out of me.  I would crawl across broken glass to vote against her.  I'd probably camp out like I was buying a concert ticket.    (subterranean Elastic Pavement - Howard Dean, in an interview, mixed his metaphor and said "that's the rubber underneath the road."  Best of the Web uses it frequently, and it has become a running gag.  Just like referring to John Kerry as the 'haughty French-looking senator who by the way served in Viet Nam'.  Sure, it is a little childish, but fun.)
