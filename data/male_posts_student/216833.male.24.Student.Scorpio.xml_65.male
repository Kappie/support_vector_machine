I woke up alone yesterday and went to denny's for breakfast. Across the room was this father and son just finishing up their pancakes when I walked in. When I'm alone at places I find myself being nosy. They were talking about what to do after graduation. The father was telling the kid to do some traveling before he meets some girl. That's fucking weak. I guess for some guys - girls are nothing but a money pit pussy worth giving up all of your dreams for a poke. I think school and a job would drag the kid down before a girl - but if that is how he see's it - whatever.  I went home and played some gta3 until my ass fell asleep and around that time mimi came home - we got some food. She left for work soon after that and I dropped off some film to get developed [I hate walmart.] I took off to school right after that - that was uneventful.  On my way home I picked up some engine cleaner and started work on my vespa engine. I have been trying to get all these parts clean so I can inspect em for wear and put it all back together. I was pretty discouraged from all that work. I havn't sweated like that in a while. It was pouring into my eyes and I felt washed out.   This went on for a while, mimi came home around 9:45 and we watched some MADtv and then we crashed like jail break. I was tired.  Today has just really begun - I've been up since around 9:30 but I had some rought sleep. I woke straight up when this HUGE crash of thunder shook the windows. It was so fucking loud. One of my jalepeno planets fell over. I put the planet back in the pot, but I'm not sure how well it will recover. Still just a baby.  Today is uncertain.   Jake and I were talking last night about challenges and how hard shit can be sometimes. I don't think time makes things any easier either. challenge after challenge and they just keep getting more difficult. There is really no one to blame for the increased difficulty - there is always something in the way. I know I'm the guy that always puts those obstacles in my way. That's fine - I don't really mind - I just need to stop bitching. I have an awesome life - my spirit is fresh and I have alot to learn and see. Just rock out and I hope I make all the right moves. Right or wrong - I can take it.
