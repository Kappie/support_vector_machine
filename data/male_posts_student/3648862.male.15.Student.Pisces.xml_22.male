He became very uncomfortable when the subject of girls came up and I found out that he has never had a girlfriend before. I feel bad betraying Ryan, but I really want a boyfriend and I'm sick of waiting around for Ryan. I think I'm going to invite Benny over tomorrow and try to get him to admit he's gay. He's really cute even though he's only 12. Only one thing is going to be a problem and that is I have to leave here in a month and a half and I will become very depressed, but I will get to see Ryan so that will cheer me up a bit. *feels like a player (AKA male slut), even though he is still a virgin*  yah, I bought Saiyuki Vol. 3 today. I bought it on Ebay so I can't wait to get it. Its supposed to be in new condition. I also earned $20 today by mowing the lawn, I wonder what I spend it on. I am getting very sad because only one person writes comments. I have no fans, and it's almost my blogs one month anniversary. I wanna know how many people read my blog daily, so everyone leave a comment. So now I'm going to bed, TTYL.
