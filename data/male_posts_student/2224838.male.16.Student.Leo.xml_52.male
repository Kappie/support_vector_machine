I competed in three categories, including infographics, newspaper design, and news writing. Both infographics and news writing were carry-in categories, which allowed me to work on designs using given information beforehand and turn them in on the day of the contest. My entries for the carry-ins were much easier to plan and create because I had about a month to make them. As for the news writing, which I had to work on within a one-hour time limit today, I did not do as well.   Suprisingly, the results of the contest were already available this afternoon, placing me second in infographics and awarding me honorable mention for newspaper design. So much for news writing I guess, but then again, it doesn't matter. I qualified for state competition with infographics and newspaper design, but I won't actually be going to Kansas University to compete because those are both carry-in categories. I will simply complete two new entries next month and send them in on May 1.  As for the rest of the people from my school, one guy placed first in yearbook copy writing and second in yearbook theme development along with another guy, and a girl received honorable mention for headline writing. The majority of the categories were dominated by Wichita East High School, but luckily Kapaun Mt. Carmel didn't win as much as usual.
