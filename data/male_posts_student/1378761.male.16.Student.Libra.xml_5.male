Sitting here in Study Hall - I have been re-assigned to the Computer Lab to help them out. That's good - I get to work on computers in air condidtioning.   Wow last night was a werid one. I was working on my dad's roof putting shingles on when it started to get dark. I just thought a little storm was moving in. Then all of the sudden they tornado alarms went on. Holy crap! The wind started to blow hard, so we got down, just as we got down it started to rain. And main, it rained! I could not see 10ft in front of me! So we all went inside. After about 10 min the alarms went of. I guess we didn't get one, but I herd one touched down outside of town. I went outside and the neighbor's tree fell down. It was blocking the whole street. There was lots of sirens but I forgot my scanner at my mom's house! Well the power was off for about 5 hours, so I was stuck doing Biology homework useing my flashlight. It was fun though.  Well that's all the Blog I have in me at this time.  **Eric**
