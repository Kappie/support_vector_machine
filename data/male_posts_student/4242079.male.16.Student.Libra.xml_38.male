If it weren't for Crystal, I suppose I would go mad, locked in my dark room...typing away...I'm sure I would have finished writing a book or something by now. I'm off tomorrow, so maybe I'll write something of substance later tonight or tomorrow...maybe. Until then,  disregard  the following URL.  http://www.adstech.com/products/USB_Instant_DVD/downloads/drivers/USB70010.exe
