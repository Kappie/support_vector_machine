The devil wants to eat it for breakfast!"  and then, a few years later, I come back to AP English to recieve more of the "I watched a wasp dying and was reminded of God. Time to go repeat the Bible again." I am godless (almost)! I am Unitarian! And then our teacher wants to stuff Jesus down our throats? Hahahahahaha fuck no.  Okay that's all I really wanted to say but I think I'll ramble for the fun of it.  I am a fellow of two very pleasant young ladies now that I do not think I had met before. One, Miss Whitney Adsit, also attends AP Biology (but not Lab) with me. The other is miss Amber Birch, who joins me in Economics and AP English. I think they are lovely and amiable.  Two tests upon the morrow! One on a book I have not read, one on the calculus equations I have barely memorized. Fun!  Cheers, chaps. Yoga tonight.
