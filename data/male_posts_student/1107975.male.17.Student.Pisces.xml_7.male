I'm 17, and looking forward to my 4th year in high school.    My interests are: My girlfriend, computers, cars, drawing, writing, and generally being stupid.    I'm in a theatre troupe at my school, called Chicken Wing Theatre. It's pretty cool.        Also, I've got a deviantART account:  urlLink http://evilmac.deviantart.com , which means that I won't upload this often. So, since no one reads this, I'll be using it for rants...If anyone stumbles upon this? Prepare to have your eyes burned out        --Out
