Of course God is not a concept, in fact, we can never begin to understand the nature of God only his (generally) ways, but not the intention behind the ways. We cannot express the nature of God into one word. Of course,there are a few words can accurately describe the character of God, but it can never describe it wholly or specifically and it would definitely be nothing short of ambigious. But I believe, to us mortals, that's how God is to us, ambigious. Which is why God is like a star in the night sky, we can only examine it through a telescope, a telescope of religion. This is really the macro-exposure and experience of God which we feel through religion. Now I'm talking about the micro, individual encounters we have with God (generally speaking).  God is so profound, limitless, deep, if we want to talk about his character, we can only talk about it through a subjective perspective, there can never be true objectivity where all ontological discussions of God is concerned. God can only reveal himself (generally) through a specific manifestation, if he throws his entire nature at us, it would not give us revelation but only bafflement. Only when he manifests himself in a specific form, only then can we understand him. Its like feeding a whole cow to a baby, you do it in one short, he'll die, you gotta cut it up into bite-sized pieces for him to eat, but also you probably won't give him to eat the udders or the eyes do you? Its like God, we would only understand a large part of him if we are truly hungry, but we can never know everything, because the "udders" and "eyes" of God's nature can be too profound for our finite human intelligence to every comprehend.  Sarah once told me that she believed God to be a practical God. I said that God is only practical because he showed you his practical side. I believe that the unadultrated manifestation of God to a hippie would be a god with a heavy peace neckalace, microphone hair, someone who preaches peace hope and love to the whole world, and has a mystical air around him, and heck, he even smells as if he protested against the vietnam war yesterday. Because there is this egalitarian, peaceful, cool side of God which he chose to manifest to the hippie.   God encompasses both masuline and feminine, sadness and happiness, yin and yang. Even certain dualists in this particular argument, argue that God is both a good God and Satan at the same time. I don't know about that lol..............(pretty much corresponds with my counter-argument to the evil argument........but I haven't really formulated a good argument to God having dual personalities and roles.). This is basically it.............
