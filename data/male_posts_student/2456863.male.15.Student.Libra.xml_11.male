I already read all of mary's and thea's journals, and since reid won't favoriteize me i'm stuck here with nothing to do.... perhaps I'll have to write another poem.  I think i'll do another silly rhymer like the pink mink.  "My Best Friend"  My best friend breeds Zarfs Down in the Darks. They yell, cuz they feel Swank. And they will until they turn Blank. Then my best friend will Say: Zarfs are you not here to Stay? My best friend breeds Zarfs Down in the Darks. Update... Reid let me read his diary now  I kept thinking... "Mein besten Freunden..."  as i was writing this one... lol german song manlick made us listen to once...  I seem to like 1 stanza poems lately... i wonder why... maybe cuz its so hard to find words that rhyme and make sense together... maybe I'll do some non-rhymers or somethin... It seems i also have been closing with the first two lines lately... I think i'm gonna put some poems up here from my old blog and my real journal (as in paper) although i warn you, anything i may have said in the past is not necessarily how i feel now... specifically this applies to the one about locks...
