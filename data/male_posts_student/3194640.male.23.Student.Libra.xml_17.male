Now about something that's really irritating me right now...   urlLink Michael Moore 's film   urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11   opened up this weekend and ended up being #1 at the box office. I must personally thank the good people of the U.S. for blowing up Mr. Moore's ego. It's already larger that it should be. We gave him an Oscar. The French gave him the  urlLink Palm d'Or . He's had a few #1 bestsellers. Why? I don't know. The man is a liar and a hypocrite. As far as I'm concerned, he's no more of a liar than those who run the country. He accuses President Bush of lying to America, then he turns around and does the very same thing. He can put his spin on anything better than any politician. Sounds like he should run for office. If he's as persuasive as he says he is, he'd be a shoe-in.   Even Moore obnoxious, before the film's release, Mr. Moore supposedly had non-partisan fact checkers check and recheck all the facts shown and presented in the "documentary". Though he's presented a lot of facts in this movie, he's also left a ton of facts out (I suggest that you read  urlLink Christopher Hitchens ' article as posted on  urlLink The Slate . It's pretty interesting). Along with the fact checkers, he's hired a team of lawyers so that he can sue those who accuse him of lying, stretching the truth, etc. Does this not seem wrong to anyone else? If Michael Moore is so pro-free speech, why is he trying to shut up his critics by threatening them with law suits? If he has the right to his opinon, why is no one else entitled to theirs? It doesn't make any sense to me at all. Mr. Moore has even stated that this is an Op-Ed film with a clear agenda: to inspire people to vote Bush out of office. This movie is  HIS  opinion. It just seems funny that we're not supposed to dispute his opinion. We're just supposed to take it in and believe it. I thought he was against that? Hmmm...  If anyone who has seen this film has any sense of what the truth is, they'd realize that this film is not the whole truth.  Also, doesn't anyone else find it funny that this "man for the people" is donating a penny to the families of 9/11? For someone who hates it when people are exploited...
