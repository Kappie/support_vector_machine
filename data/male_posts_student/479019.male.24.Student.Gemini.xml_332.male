I feel quite tired, but must catch the bus in a few minutes to meet up with Chi-Wei and Jeff to go to Hooters.  This weekend I need to get through the  Capitalism and Slavery  book, Nick's book so I can return it, the readings for 602... and perhaps start working on some papers.  I wonder how much of that stuff, I'll actually get done?  **
