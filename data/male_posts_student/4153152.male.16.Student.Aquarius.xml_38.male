    
       Early tomorrow morning (about 8) I'll be leaving my humble home for Cheyenne, Wyoming. We'll spend some time there for Frontier Days. We'll go to whatever happens, and a concert. The concert's by some Australianguy named Keith Urban. I wanted to buy some things at Circuit City, but I wasn't able to save enough money. I was able to put off the gas, but the cable bill had to be paid. Damn.  After Cheyenne, I'll be home for a day, and then we'll head off to a lake. We'll camp there for a few days, and then return home. It will be kind of boring, but I won't have to think about what's happening at work. I know when I come back we'll be screwed again, but I don't care right now. A week and a half, and I won't have to work. Oh yeah.  Ok, I'm off to pack. I'll be back in August.
