I suppose I've just been on the computer most of the day. What a waste of time.... I had 2 games of chess too, this time on level 2, I won one, and lost one. I may play again later for a best of three. I also spent a while writing a rather good legend for my nation Pisylvania, which can be viewed on the forum. (If you're not a member of our forum, leave a comment if you really want a read.) I'm quite proud of it, and I think I've found something I really enjoy. I've only written about 500 words so far, but more will be comming along shortly. And finally I had a generally uneventful shopping trip to Sainsburys with mum, the only mildly interesting thing happening being that I saw our (former) assistant head of year walking along Beckenham high street. I looked away quickly before he had a chance to notice I was there. And that was my day. Not particually interesting, I'll try and do something more worth while tomorrow. Like learn some more Esperanto, or... or.... well, something other than playing  urlLink neopets  games. Even though I haven't actually done that for a few days.  And now for something different. Or not.  Bye for now.
