Today, my gf did the  sweetest  thing. She surprised me during Computer Science by posting little love notes all over the computer where i usually sit :).  READERS: How sweet! Can we read them? ME: No, that's private!!!!! You'd have to steal my wallet first...... READERS: Hmmmm...... *scheming and plotting* ME: *nervously checks over his shoulder*  Today was filled with bad Spanish tests, mind-blowing history discussions, snoozing through English class, and lots of  "ChapStick Action"  *sheepish grin* I had such a good time with my girl today, from chatting all the way through first period free to watching her do a fine job cheerleading for the basketball game, and all the in-betweens, she just helped to top the day off as a most excellent one.  On a sad note, I have SATs on Saturday. On a happy note, we're going out on our first date that night! Baby, I love you sooooo much.   Killing yourself yet Brian?  :) Hasta ma√±ana, my faithful readers (all 5 of you).
