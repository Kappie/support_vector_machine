Nothing more, and no it doesn't relate to anything.  I never knew that song was on the School of Rock soundtrack.  I still need to see that movie.  So today I did nothing, hahaha yeah my life is dull as hell right now, which explains the frequency at which I am writing on here.  I think me and my mom are actually going to do something tomorrow, so that should be fun.  She has been being a bitch lately though, but we get along 99% of the time.  She's definitely not as bad as I sometimes make her out to be.  I am trying to get music to play on here.  Hendrix at the Atlanta Pop Festival, 7-4-70.  Badass show.  Ok that's all for now...I think I'm gonna go to bed here in a few mins.
