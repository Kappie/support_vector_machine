Kidman cited the fact that she had "never met him" as reason for the denial, calling the entire situation "a little strange." In all politeness, though, she did say this in a radio interview:  "I did decline but, hey, the way my love life is I took it as a great compliment."  Which begs the subtle question...how fucked up is your love life if you consider a date offer from a twice-suspected child molester a compliment? Jesus Christ, Nicole, I've got a hotel key and a once-soiled blindfold if you want another compliment.
