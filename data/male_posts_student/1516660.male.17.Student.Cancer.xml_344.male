I had diarrhea. Stupid right? Again. Heh Heh. I was actually going to school, but halfway on the journey, my stomach act up and I have to rushed back home (luckily we just left Woodlands, can U-Turn back easily). Ah well. I missed a lot of things. Hmm. what did I do at home? Certainly not homework. Heh Heh. I surfed the Net all day. Yeah la..lazy me, and still don't want to blog right? Bad KY!!  Okay. So today I went back to school. I noticed that CQ and YF has gotten closer. It must be due to my absence. Oh yes. Remind me to tell you what happened later when I walk home with Gloria. Damn funny. Anyway, seee! My absence has let CQ made more friends. Beneficial right? :P  Hmmm. I have to take a Maths test, along with 3 other absentees. Well, the first question is peanuts, until the last one, where I cannot solve for 'x'! Ayioh! It turns out that all of us that are taking cannot find 'x' either! Heh heh! Not only me wor.   Hmmm.... During PW, thanks to Tham, we made our project better. He let us understand things better and to specify our scope. Good! Even Mdm Shafrah, who was "PW (Pronounced as POW by Tham) Dictionary" came over and complimented on our project. YAY! We've gotten the green light by both teachers! :D  Hmmm. Today the SAF Choir came to perform for us! Woah! Enriching performance man! All of us want to buy tickets to watch their performance! We like them man! Great voice! Finally! Me and CQ found a place in the amry unit where we belong! CQ wants to go to the choir. If I can't, then I will apply for the drama unit lor! At least this beats running around the field and getting yourself killed!   I finsihed my homework. The MI tutorial, Chinese compo's corrections and I have to do PW later. Must come up with analysis of our topic (nightlife in Singapore). Yes!   Opps. I forgot to write the story of what happened on our way back. Yes. Well, me and Gloria were walking from Admiralty MRT. She was telling me that CQ and YF got closer and CQ told Gloria "I made new friends, and I don't have to depend on KY." That CQ ar! HaHa! In idgination, I said "What? Now I am like trash! Can throw away liao lor!" Then, this guy was walking past us in the opposite direction and he said "No lor! You are not anything at all lor! (Ni she me duo bu shi lor!)" loudly. I was shocked and when I turned back to look at him, he was talking on the phone. Me and Gloria burst out laughing. HAHAHA! Oh my god! Such a huge coincidence! HAHAHA!! For a while, I thought the guy was actually talking to me man. HAHA! So funny sia! LOL!  Oh well. I gotta go now. See ya! Night blog!
