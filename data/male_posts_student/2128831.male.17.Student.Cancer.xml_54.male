It's something that's there but as easy as it comes it'll go away too. It had for 3 consecutive bi-months already. So here it is again. But while am at that period, things just feel so heavy. Although not yet as bad as the past two times that I noticed it happening but it's just the first day.  It got me to thinking though, 1) has this been happening before just did not realize it and 2) did I jump into the 'Decision" because of this? Said 'Decision' also happened at the end of the month six months ago. Sleep these last several calendar entries has been fitful, my energy during the daylight hours has at times been lower than normal. This morning, I had to drag myself out of a seductively warm bed to prepare for someone stopping by at the god awful hour of 8:30. I somehow managed a fair imitation of consciousness, produced decent enough English to get myself through the interchange. After they'd gone I grabbed my gym bag, guided my half-comatose body out the door. Brisk air, morning light swelling in the eastern sky, small car filled with quiet people (apart from noises listed in the first paragraph above.  My Evil Plan (tm)! Your objective is simple: Widespread Misery. Your motive is a little bit more complex: Sadistic pleasure  Stage One To begin your plan, you must first traumatize a wealthy heiress. This will cause the world to sense a grave disturbance in the force, paralyzed by your arrival. Who is this nightmare beyond comprehension? Where did they come from? And why do they look so good as an intelligence transferred into a computer?   Stage Two Next, you must desecrate the Internet. This will all be done from a floating fortress, a mysterious place of unrivaled dark glory. Upon seeing this, the world will die in a way you just don't want to think about, as countless hordes of computer programmers hasten to do your every bidding.   Stage Three Finally, you must send forth your plague of doom, bringing about nightmares for every man, woman and child. Your name shall become synonymous with sheer dementedness, and no man will ever again dare take your lunch money. Everyone will bow before your mind-boggling insanity, and the world will have no choice but to worship the ground you walk on.   Mrrrhahahahahahahahahahaha!   Witch (Ode to the Bitch)  I will not forget  all the pain that I met within you words and eyes. The things you imply... make me confused. I'm not amused  and for once what I want...   Is to fall into this black hole and forget you and stamp out everything that gets in my way. So that it won't exsist... a place this pain won't be missed  and where I won't have to love again...  ...because love is trouble... and love says, "I'm a bitch."  And love hates...well...at least me. And the world warned me she was a witch.  No...but I did not listen... no...I didn't care... that what I was giving and getting  was no longer fair.  But it doesn't matter, at least not for today. Cause I'm going to discard her... I'm going to throw her away...  Just like she did to me. I'm going to forget love Eventually... Apathy...come set me free.  I'm gone now...you can't have me back. Fool me twice and shame on me. Well...you fooled me thrice... you misery.  Down with my love... forever more... It's about time that I killed  these injuries...
