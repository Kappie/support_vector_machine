And today did that for him.  Classes were short and sweet.  Semi-sweet.  Kinda bittersweet at times, like the chocolate.  The majority of his time was spent talking as usual so he stayed somewhat entertained.  And Mrs. Dyke-Bitch pretty much told everyone that she was a skanky-ho and that when she went to college she "found boys."  But you all know what that means.  Ewwww by the way.  If you don't know who she is then you are lucky cuz after knowing her you would not want to think this way about her.  And Tyke really hates that he is thinking about it now but he has to so as to please the crowd.  Also in english he let Purdy have another one of his mixes he made in the past.  It's fun to have other people tell him they like the songs he puts on mixes.  So now he is going to make another version for Dotti as he is sure that she will want it too.  And Purdy wants him to put all his good songs on her MP3 player sometime so he will.  Music is a huge part of his life.  He is always listening to music and it really amplifies his moods.  It can also sway his moods but he doesn't do that to himself anymore.  He only listens to music that provides the same mood as what he is feeling at that time.  If that makes any sense.  If it doesn't then just disregard.  Right now Tyke is watching the Real World.  He hasn't ever really liked the show but he still watches it.  It is kind of interesting but in a weird way.  He really doesn't like mean people.  So he always likes watching the nice people on shows like this.  Cuz he sympathizes with them.  After school today Tyke went over to Macaroon's with Fejj and later Amed.  They played some hoops to start out with and that was fun.  Except for one part.  Which was funny but not fun for Tyke.  He had been getting great vertical on his leaps and was getting his entire hand easily into the hoop so he thought maybe he could dunk.  So he took the ball and started to go and jumped off of one foot but at the same time he sorta slipped with his other foot.  So he jumped and fell all at the same time.  It seemed like it was slow motion and he thought he had an easy opportunity to correct himself and land without hurting himself but that sure as hell didn't happen.  He fell on his left elbow (one with screw in it), left hip (not the one that got hit with the ball bearing), and his hands.  All hurt but it wasn't too bad.  More of an hilarious stunt that should have been videotaped.  It would be a classic.  Oh yeah, he missed the dunk...The crew went inside Macaroon's and hung out for a while.  Then Skippy came over and they decided to play some more bball.  It was fun.  Tyke is feeling good about his matchup on Friday.  He thinks he can really have his game escalate to the level he needs to win.  They probably will lose but whatever.  It will be a grand ole time.  Tyke is now really hoping that at some time he will be able to dunk.  He is pretty close he thinks.  The big problem is that even if he can jump high enough he doesn't really have big enough hands to dunk most balls.  So it would be a two hand slam.  And it would be weak.  Whatever though.  Tonight was another lax night for Tyke.  Since there were no events going on he stayed home and just chilled.  He'll prolly do his only homework, math, during the OC so that is good.  And Tyke got an urge to vacuum today too.  He vacuumed the downstairs and even his bathroom.  That is much easier than sweeping.  Try it sometime.  But since Tyke's house is the party house he wants to keep it somewhat clean.  Especially when he has lady friends over...whenever that may be.  He has people over to his house pretty much every weekend.  Like almost literally every weekend people come over to his house.  It has never been much of a problem and he has liked it but lately he wants to do something else.  Or at least have new people over.  The guys just are playing video games together all the time and then occasionally some Chinko.  Tyke wants to play some board games he just realized.  Yeahhh...board games.  Real fun times.  Maybe he will do that after the girls game Friday.  Some board games and Chinko and videotape watching/making.  If not watching, then making.  Nonetheless Tyke decided that Friday nights are the best nights of the week.  Saturday nights aren't as good cuz the next day is Sunday and people are busier on Saturdays than Fridays in many cases.  So...thats about it.  Hope you likey.  Byey.  Fer Fer is out.  And so is Tyke.
