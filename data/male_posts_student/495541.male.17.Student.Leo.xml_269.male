I figured I would post something for all the people who read this or don't read this.  If you somehow have a link to this in your bookmarks, I love you.  Thanks for reading.  E-mail me your blog and I'll read it every day.  I'm currently listening to a title by Beethoven.  It has a long title... "Sonata for Piano No.14 in C Sharp Minor, Op.27, No.2 'Moonlight/Mondschein', Adagio Sostenuto"  I guess I could just call it "Moonlight/Mondschein."  Either way, it's a great song.  I've heard it a couple times, I think I even downloaded it once before.  I took my free song cap and downloaded it on iTunes though, last night.  It makes me want to learn how to play the piano.  That happens a lot, but it's just a very emotional song.  I was just on BibleGateway reading the verse of the day and a part of the verse struck me.  "Woe to me that I dwell in Meshech, that I live among the tents of Kedar! Too long have I lived among those who hate peace. I am a man of peace; but when I speak, they are for war." Psalm 120 5-7  That verse just makes me think.  I'm going to eat some lunch.  Good day.
