The bitterness appears And I, wail, weep in Pain, for you took away Truth.  Let the crows hear my plea Let the vultures devour Your waking hours And leave you in the night, Clothed with naked truth Thus, I give you A Love.  Letâ€™s tread in the Nightmares life showers So that only I Comfort you With my vengeance, My proof of Life, Love.
