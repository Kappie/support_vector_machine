Not long after, we set off for a ride around the city, which was cool.  We went to this large park by a lake, and I mean big!  We picked up drinks (I had a can of Mountain Dew, my new found love lol :D) and then we went to this park bit where there were swings, whoooooosh.    We then drove around for a bit (I spotted some English looking traffic lights) until we finally came back home.  I spent the afternoon playing on my Gameboy until dinner time.  We had this gorgeous meatloaf consisting of beef, onion and kechup.  After, we played a game called Aggrivation with marbles, a bit like ludo, frustration, whatever you wanna call it, followed by a blue raspberry popcicle, and then a few rounds of Balderdash.  Dan and Ryan went to bed (well, if you can call two sofas a bed!) and we went outside the back to a beautiful large red star, Mars to be exact.  The topic of conversation changed from stuff about space, to evolution and how we believe it's a load of crap followed by my favourite subject: how Earth was blessed with Humans! lol  We had a cool chat about how angry the atmosphere was in Atlanta when we arrived on American soil, and then about how different it was and how cold it can get.  I was told the coldest it can get in winter is 0 degrees....Fahrenheit, which is like nearly -20 degrees Celcius!!  Just about to get to sleep in my nice warm... floor! :D  I have pics of the day but I can't upload them here, you'll have to wait till we get back in San Antonio ;)  That might be tommorow or Tuesday, not certain yet.  Nighty night...
