(story for another day)....2) I bought the new Jay Z album.  I consider myself an expert on musical critique.  I have been involved in some controversial debates (most notably my proclamation that LL Cool J is overall the best rapper of the early era (not up for debate anymore).  Well Jay has officially become the best rapper of the new era with this album.  Witness track two "Takeover" where he lyrically demolishes all competition, past, present, and future, small and large, minor and major.  Need more evidence?  Disregard the radio friendly (yet still unbelieveably high quality) lead single Izzo (H.O.V.A.).  Girls, Girls, Girls is the truth.  I could go track by track, but instead I will say buy the album.  It's this year's Stankonia as far as I'm concerned.
