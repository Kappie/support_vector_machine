Whatever...I still couldn't decide.  Crunch time...I decided to dye it... ... ... ALL OVER COLOR! BLEACHED WHITE!!!!  However the stuff I used to dye my hair was super super potent. I almost passed out. Just before dying my hair...I hit my head too. So there was a small cut on my head, that felt good with the bleach on it :P  After that I played some game with  urlLink Zach  back to his house to play some video game that I can never remember the name to.  That was the excitement of my night. If my mom doesn't like my hair Im gonna dye it black like  urlLink my idol's  hair!
