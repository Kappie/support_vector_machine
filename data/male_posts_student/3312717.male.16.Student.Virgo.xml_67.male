I remember we didn't do it because it turned out to be the coldest day of the year.  Hawkeye, I invite you to everything that you would concievably come to. If we are calling everyone up, chances are I'll call you. If me and the Oselands are doing something, well, chances are you'd regret coming with us anyway.  Jeff, I just forget to call you. Houley went by your house the other day when we were going to the movie to invite you along, but you weren't there.  I don't really feel like blogging tonight, but I will anyway.  Of course we feel that we are inherently better than (most) other people. I feel that this is basic human nature. We are always on a high ground, be it morally or intellectually or musically, in my case. Think about it this way: How many people to you look up too, as opposed to how many people you look down on? How many people do you know that you trust their judgement over your own? You could clarify respect and admiration more clearly, though. I admire people like myself, but I also have great respect for people radically different than myself.   I am currently listening to:  Rock Against Bush Volume One . Some songs I like, some I hate. "Sink, Florida, Sink," by Against Me! is my favorite song on it I haven't heard, and Rx Bandits, Jello Biafra, Authority Zero, and the Soviettes also contribute great songs. Hell, even the Get Up Kids contribute something a little better than mediocre. My major pet peeves: the Descendents song, "Sad State of Affairs," sucks, and the Ataris contributed a blasphemous cover of "Heaven is Falling." Hearing one of my favorite BR songs sung by the Ataris was as depressing as hearing Simple Plan cover "American Jesus" during VWT. Also, Kris Roe butchers the vocals. I will allow that it was cool to hear it acoustic, even though I had already played it acoustic before to see what it sounded like.  I've got to work the next three days.   Oh yeah, I'm going to go ahead and make that blog mix. Contribute 4 songs you like, and I'll mix them up and force John to burn them in that exact order under pain of death.   Uhhh, camping. I hate to camp. Actually, I don't like going outside of my house with members of my family. I see them enough here. I don't like going on vacation.   Another thing about that Ataris cover: The whole point of an acoustic cover is to strip the song down to basics. They add a violin and some effects and it sounds horrible. Also, the recording quality is almost as bad as Tai Chi Bob's "A Stupid Demo to Show Your Friends."  Now, when I saw the Ataris at VWT I wasn't one of those throwing garbage at them (By saw, I mean listening in the background because I was talking with Roger of LTJ during their and AFI's sets. I wanted to see AFI, though.). I remembered  Broken Hearts... , and respected. I even got  So Long, Astoria , but all I found was MTV-friendly emo-pop.  Me and Chris and Bryce went swimming today. The cold dampened our enjoyment of it but didn't stop us from swimming for two and a half hours. Me and Chris got into the mother of all mud fights and Bryce got a weird orange rash. It was fun.  Later on I tried to get Chris to eat five bratwurst but he could only get three down. This, after he foolishly boasted that he could eat seven.  I have nothing else to say.   Good night.
