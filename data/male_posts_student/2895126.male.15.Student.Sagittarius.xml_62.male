He just absolutely ditched me today at work. He promised dear, sweet Sister Rose that he would let me know (because he volunteered me for work, you see) and never told me.  So I was interrupted during dinner and had to work late.  Sister Rose said it herself, "That was a very mean thing of him to do!"
