And its starting to seem like no matter what i do I cant get away from this. A few days ago i went to court for what i did and i remember walking into the courtroom ready to face what i did wrong with the judge. After being in the courtroom for about 5 minutes i found out that judge wasnt as .. lets say.. "kind" as i would have thought, but hey, what are taxes for.   As far as posting on my website i hope that my free speech rights are still enforced, you can go to the top left hand link on my website to visit the free speech online campaign which I back 100%. http://www.eff.org/br/  The free speech campaign doesnt mean that i believe that people can say bad and mean things to people on the internet and get away with it, what it means is that i shouldnt be persecuted for writing my feelings on my own website domain which i purchased with my own money.  Okay - Back to what i was writing about. It seems that i can never escape what i did and that it will never leave me alone, just when i thought that the punishment was almost over it starts back up again. Theres just one thing that i want to say to anyone who is reading this, and i hope you listen - never, ever mess with the law.
