Usually the first time I hear their stuff, I don't like it that much. Then it grows on me. It's that way with all the garage bands too. I remember thinking  T(I)NC  and  Randy  were annoying.. but now they're some of my favorites. I decided that for my dinner party Saturday night, I'm gonna bust out all my Marxist music. It will be all sociology students after all!  Man... didn't get much reading done last night. Fuck... class at 10...  **
