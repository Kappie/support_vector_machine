Kinda.  I know I quit and then came back and didn't post and blah blah blah...sorry about all that.  I've been working this summer!  Actually WORKING!  Did you think that was possible?  And at school, no less.  I've been working for the registrar and in the bookstore...fun stuff, eh?  But I stopped doing that because I strained my back lifting books and stuff.  Just think about that when you go to registration you LC folks...I hurt myself so that ya'll could get books.  :D  Just kidding.  But it's gonna be funky this year...all the books are in the Studio Theater and you're going to get them at Registration.   You LN people are lucky.  But I got money for our stupidity, so it's all good.  Anyway, I hope my posting isn't too weird for all of you...I'm just bored and don't really have much to do.  Sorry.  Bye!   There aren't Arabian ninjas, they just wear the same pants!
