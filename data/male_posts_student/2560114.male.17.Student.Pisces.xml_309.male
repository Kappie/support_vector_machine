When i first met steph, vball went down to hell...then when she broke up wit me, vball seemed to b whats best for me. I guess life jus has to have balance and i have to deal with w/e comes to me...it sux though...i can't get 2 good things at the same time. Yeah im happy that i have a chance to play at hawaii, and other d-1 schools, but at times like these i jus get lonely.  Plus, senior year is comin up...my last year of sweet high school bliss and the joy of not having the responsible to an adult quite yet...bein free to choose what u want to b when u grow up and what u want in the future, freely thinkin of all the great outcomes end in 2005 for me and my fellow seniors at oxnard high. My plan so far after high school is to go to hawaii and play vball there and major in either art or music...even another major...idk. Finally gettin out of oxnard is a blessing and a sad reality...i'm never goin to c some of the ppl that i have been growin up wit these last 4 years...if only i could go back to when i was a freshman and live what i have been through so far would b a blast. W/e...hopefully my senior year will b the best one at oxnard high.  Don't worry about me ppl, i basically do these posts jus out of pure boredom, cuz when im bored i think too much and then i think about the negetives...which is not a good thing.  Right now...im not sure if i want to b in a relationship anytime soon or at least persue one. becuz of this balance, i don't want anything to interfear with the success i've been having lately at vball...all i am willing to do right now is working hard at what i love to do and getting something great out of it, like a scholarship. If something does come up unexpectedly, girl wise, then w/e...i jus have to c what happenz...and try not to fall in too deep this time. I jus don't want to fall into the same mistakes that i have made with relationships or do those things cuz its me alwayz gettin ended up wit the bad news...fuck you.  done wit my boredom ramblings...payce.
