Even though it is a pass or fail course, everything is made up, acting it doesn't matter if it is bad but if you take the effort to act it. The laughs and the clapping bring rejuvenate the soul of the person acting. The feeling of a good joke and the response from the audience makes all the different. The different games and the recycling of the people bring fresh ideas into the society with ideas and new laughs. Even though all of this is fun there are always the people that seem to dislike the class, don't like to participate and feel that they don't need to participate. There is one girl in my improvisation class that rarely likes to participate and will make her stay as long as possible try too hard to get laughs and make the experience so dull that they suck the fun out of the moment, she is pretty stupid, like she makes Jessica Simpson look like Einstein. But besides that the rest of the class likes to participate and makes the rest of the class period extremely hilarious.
