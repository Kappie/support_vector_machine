It isn't the bad place John makes it out to be, it is just him exaggerating like he usually does. But hey, look who's talking. The people that work there aren't bad for the most part. It kind of depresses me because it seems that the Dairison is as far as they will go in life. What kind of life is shuffling between fast food and home?   That is why I don't work much. Well, 18 hours is a lot to me, but I'm saving for digital camera/VWT and after that I'll cut back. I hate the idea of having no free time. What is the point of having a summer if you have to work all the time?   Money comes and goes, possessions are fleeting, blah, blah, blah.   Seriously, the life experience I get just hanging out is much more valuable to me than the check I get every week.  Wow, the idea well is dry tonight.  Today on Nationstates telegrammed me asking me if I was a "peace punk" or a "riot punk." What a stupid question, I replied. Obviously social change is only going to come through peaceful methods, and not through your misguided ideas of "anarchy." When there is no government, who will run our hospitals, our schools, our federal aid programs, etc? People who care about America enough to be stuck in a dead-end bureaucratic job fort 25 years?  Who will protect us from the towelheads?  On a more personal note, my mood seems to worsen every day. I seem to be slipping back into that pit of sarcasm and apathy that I worked so hard to climb out of. I don't know why, either. I just am. My mood swings weirdly during the school year, but usually everything is copacetic in the summer.  Today in Derby's blog he said he didn't want to talk about something in his blog. Well, why not? Blogs are supposed to be personal, especially if you are tempted to dismiss everything out-of-hand when in person. The white space here brings out thoughts I don't usually think, I find.  I don't like being suprised, and when someone tells me something I hadn't been expecting, my natural reaction is to get mad. I've noticed when I get suprised, I don't handle it with my usual aplomb.  I also dislike being asked loaded questions. This is possibly the worst way to argue ever concieved.  I wasn't challenged at all today (except as Clash Champion) personally, or ideologically. That bothers me. I hate days when I don't have to think, and I'm going to pick a fight with someone tomorrow if I am not intellectually stimulated soon. I think top-form Josh comes out when I am being told I am wrong, or called bitter, or a nerd, or a psuedopunk, or whatever. I am good at arguing because I did it virtually every day for years, both logically and illogically. Fight to Live, as the Bouncing Souls say. Conflict is the spice of life.   Day to day living is too interesting for me to take. I'm serious, too. I remember in past years weeks would go by before I left my room. I wished my neighbor's house would blow up or something so I had a reason to leave my house. I probably don't have any more friends now than I did then, and I know I don't like them more now.   Maybe my whole outlook has changed. Maybe I'm a honest-to-God optimist now, and can see the point in everything. Optimist isn't the correct word. It's like I can see inside the machine now, see how all the cogs and gears fit together, and I know that  everything  has a point, so it doesn't matter what I do. It is probably the most comforting idea I've ever had.  I recently found out that the mall is like the ultimate socialization point for people. I don't like to go there, except for the bookstore which I enter through the side doors. There was the aforementioned people I saw yesterday, and today I saw two people from school I didn't care to talk to and Chrys Mathison at FYE. He is a pretty good guy, I worked on a few packages with him in TV Pro.   Well, I'm sick of blogging. That's all for tonight,   Raow
