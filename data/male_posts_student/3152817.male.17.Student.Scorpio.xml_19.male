The Democrats have done an extream-makeover on John Kerry that would make even TLC proud.  But, no superficial makeover can cover up Kerry’s 20 year Senate voting record or his years of documented public remarks.  In his acceptance speech tonight, Kerry asks us to "…judge me by my record."  Lets do just that.    "I will be a commander in chief who will never mislead us into war."   That was an excerpt from Kerry’s acceptance speech tonight.  Now read the following excerpt from the congressional record in October of 2002.   "It would be naive to the point of grave danger not to believe that, left to his own devices, Saddam Hussein will provoke, misjudge, or stumble into a future, more dangerous confrontation with the civilized world. … He has supported and harbored terrorist groups, particularly radical Palestinian groups such as Abu Nidal, and he has given money to families of suicide murderers in Israel. … We should not go to war because these things are in his past, but we should be prepared to go to war because of what they tell us about the future."  "The threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real, but as I said, it is not new. It has been with us since the end of that war, and particularly in the last 4 years we know after Operation Desert Fox failed to force him to reaccept them, that he has continued to build those weapons. He has had a free hand for 4 years to reconstitute these weapons, allowing the world, during the interval, to lose the focus we had on weapons of mass destruction and the issue of proliferation."   After making the case against Iraq, Senator Kerry voted to give the president the power to use force to disarm Iraq. Quite a change in policy for Senator Kerry isn’t it?    Let’s take another quote from Kerry’s speech tonight.     "Saying there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq doesn't make it so."   Ok.  I agree.  Then why did Senator Kerry help to convince congress and the UN that there were weapons?   "The Iraqi regime's record over the decade leaves little doubt that Saddam Hussein wants to retain his arsenal of weapons of mass destruction and to expand it to include nuclear weapons. We cannot allow him to prevail in that quest."    "Regime change has been an American policy under the Clinton administration, and it is the current policy. I support the policy. But regime change in and of itself is not sufficient justification for going to war--particularly unilaterally--unless regime change is the only way to disarm Iraq of the weapons of mass destruction pursuant to the United Nations resolution."   Both of these statements made by John Kerry on the Senate floor in October of 2002.    John Kerry? Attempting to "mislead" us into war? How could he be so hypocritical?    Let’s try one more quote from tonight’s speech.     "Saying we can fight a war on the cheap doesn't make it so."   I don’t recall the Bush administration trying to avoid providing proper funding for the war.  Perhaps it was Senator Kerry who has tried to under-fund our troops.      "I actually did vote for his $87 billion, before I voted against it."   Yes.  Sadly it’s true.  Senator Kerry did vote against the 87 billion dollars to fund our troops in combat.  And yes, at the same time, he tries to accuse President Bush of "fighting a war on the cheep."     Had enough two faced lies for one day?  If not, check out the  urlLink GOP website .
