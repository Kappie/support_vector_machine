The Museum of Contemporary Art was just plain weird. The exhibit I went to, by Janet Cardiff, was an audio wALkthrough of the Villa Medici in Rome. Next time, I'd rather something more traditionAL.  Space Station 3D was pretty cool, except that there wasn't any reference point to enhance the 3D experience and Tom Cruise, the narrator, is a little full of himself. Still, the generAL movie, the 3Dness of it, and the space videography are definitely worth seeing.  The Notre Dame Basilica, near the Museum des Sciences de MontreAL (where Space Station 3D was playing), had amazing architecture. It was obvious at that point that MontreAL was trying to be a mini-Paris. Even so, if you're ever in MontreAL, you should stop by.  The Parc Olympique was ok. The stadium looked awesome (http://www.rio.gouv.qc.ca/images/imgfra/anno.gif, it's in the black ring), and the view from the top of the tower connected to it was breathtaking but predictable. The Biodome, with 4 different ecosystems, had some quaint creatures, like penguins and a tamarin. The BotanicAL Gardens had some very exotic flora, but I'm not reALly a plant person. Sure, if you're in the city, go to the Olympic Park, but I would skip the flowers.  In conclusion, MontreAL is ok for a visit, but Boston is far superior.
