Then we went to the Subway where  igot the application from, and i handed it in. Then my mom went and gave me my money to use in the bahams.  I got ready, and by 6:00 we were ready and we went to the hospital to meet my dad, then we all went to brooklyn for dinner with my brother. My brothers girlfriends family was there too. It was really nice.  Got home around 11:30 ish.  Man, im excited about the bahamas....ah.....  Until Next Time.
