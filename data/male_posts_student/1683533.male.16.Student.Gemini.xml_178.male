Check Out This Ride! and the one with Pool Party on it: Myths, Legends and Other Amazing Adventures Vol. 2. The shirt I got is the one that says Aquabats and has the monkey guys on it.  Well, we are gonna have a band practice maybe thursday, we havent had one in awhile.  That's good though cause I need the time to write songs.  I'm looking for a new job, somewhere closer to my house.  I applied to Meijer's today, and I might get in at CVS cause my neighbor is the pharmacist there.  We are gonna start filming the movie I have been talking about before pretty soon.  That will be fun.  Ugh, Im gonna go do stuff    urlLink
