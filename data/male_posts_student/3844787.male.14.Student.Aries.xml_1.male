We went too a place called Broad Acre's, where I saw some of my school mates there, which was nice too say hello, so we chatted, and they left, then I started my fishing, all night I was catching 6 poundish fish, so after we went too the pub too celebrate.  Today, I woke up and did some chores, and went on the PC, few phone calls, Dad came home for a bit, I went too the shop, then I came home and went on the PC for about ten minutes and I went too McDonalds with my mum and went too my aunties house and then went shopping, because my auntie was in Hospital really sick. Then We came home, and watched School of Rock, which was a wicked film, so that was a good day. Umm... no.... i'll report here tomorrow, maybe late because i'm working on a building site. How fun!!
