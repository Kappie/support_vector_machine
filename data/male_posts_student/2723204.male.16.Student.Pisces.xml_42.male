Sunny Surreal     The sunlight warms the land, warms my heart. Thermal expansion, physical decompression. But the rays of this sun, so surreal, I can never comprehend. I have remembered when the sun turned away, My presence, it treated with condescend. Like the sun at 7 in the morning, Thawing away the cold last night.  For she is like the morning sun, warm but surreal. The landscape she colours, like a photograph in sepia. But the sunlight is not only for me alone, Am I selfish to ask for all of this warmth? She is, after all, the sun, must I share its rays with all?  A long ardous climb, up the stairway to the sun. My limbs bruised by jealousy, my face bleeding with rejection. I seek healing from the morning sun, and she gave me some. For the first time, I no longer conversed at the grass. Our laughter mingled, our voices entertwined, amidst mists so ethereal. Communication sublime, all actions subtle.  But the real meaning before the full stop, I can never fully grasp. Up among the clouds, where melancholy is passe, But trends which go one full circle is what I truly fear.  Please do not banish me back to the Earth, For I do not want to climb this stairway to heaven all over again
