Data compression and digital signal processing make it possible for the cable company to cram four or five channels of programming into the space where only one analog channel would otherwise go. Using this magic, it is now possible to have 500 stupid channels instead of just 90.  So there I was, watching one of my favorite stupid channels, when I noticed that the network didn't match up with the channel number. Channel 162 is supposed to be BBC America but instead I was seeing Professional Bull Riding on the Outdoor Life Network (OLN). I don't subscribe to OLN. Given a choice, I would rather beat my head against a wall than watch OLN.  I clicked to what was supposed to be TNN/Spike TV and got MTV-2 (also, not something to which I subscribe). CNN was Bravo, Bravo was Home Shopping, IFC was unavailable and so on. My world began crashing down around me. It was almost as if I couldn't trust what I saw on the screen.  There aren't too many things that a man in this day and age can call his own but I think that the bond between a male and his remote control is a sacred thing -- not to be trifled with. Take away that basic foundational relationship, and everything else falls away like a house of cards. Set adrift in a sea of uncertainty, I sought counseling and solace from the cable company customer service personnel.  After turning off, un-plugging, wiggling this, changing that, as instructed by the service representative to no avail, I was asked to bring the cable box in for repair or replacement. I'm going to do that today. I'm still a bit shaken, but I know that eventually all will be set right.  Occasionally we read about some apparently deranged individual walking into their place of work with a rifle, or about someone leaping out into traffic at a busy intersection and we have to ask ourselves: Is this person getting the quality Cable Television that they need? Could this tragedy have been prevented if only Lou Dobbs' MoneyLine had come in more clearly or if "Worlds Worst Drivers" had not been preempted by local advertisements? Perhaps we will never know, but paying attention to these societal pressures more closely may help us stave off loss and pain in the future.  Click.
