I saw Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which was weird for the sake of being weird. But good. It was nice. That was a joke you would find funnier if you saw the movie. Only one Caveat emptor: the movie, despite the presence of Jim Carrey isn't terribly funny. It's funny at times. Just don't go in expecting massive hilarity, because there's not much there. However do go in with the idea that somewhere around the 1:30 mark, you're going to see Kirsten Dunst in her panties. So it's still totally worth nine bucks.  Also I added a Site Meter. How many times can six people visit the same site? ' I'm gonna find out if it kills me, dammit! The sky is pink and it's raining turkeys; what more do you need?!
