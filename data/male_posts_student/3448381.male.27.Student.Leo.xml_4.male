I thought of becoming a writer - than I could work while lying on the beach ;-) but I guess my prospects of success aren't that good!? " --- The Great Drunken German  It is not that I hate my job.  I just hate working.  I hate the idea of having to get up every morning and walk the path of the commuter.  Every day I look down the road and see a mass of people leaving buses, trains, cars, etc. all on a mission, a final destination.  I usually get the image of the Lady in Red scene in the first Matrix movie where you see one big mass flowing together as one.  I swear it is an entity all on its own.    The road trip for this mass ends at a desk behind a computer where they grow old and fat but in the process learn a good number of tax codes and regulations.    Do not get me wrong.  I do use the word hate rather loosely but in this case, I really assign a strong intention behind.  When I think of the success that my German counterpart talks about, I don’t think about the accomplishments gained behind my work laptop or the promotion I may be up for this coming fall.    Today is not the first time I’ve had this feeling.  It goes and comes.  Some days are better than others.  I think it’s more of my mind and body reacting to the system, rejecting its grip.  I don’t think I’m alone.  Especially since I know that most of you have your employers on your “Fuck You” list.  Shit, a German half way around the world feels the same way I do.  I think we all just haven’t found the alternative.  For some odd reason, I figure that working behind a desk is not the way to live, that's not the way to grow old and fat!  But the real question, the billion-trillion-quadrillion dollar question is: What is the "right" way to live?  Is it behind a desk, where the pockets are sure to grow but the soul withers?  Or is it on my German friend’s beach?  What would we do if we didn't have to work?   I asked a co-worker yesterday if he had all living expense paid and $500 a month in spending money for the rest of his life, would he be happy.  In other words, if given the chance not to work, would he take it?  His response: I think I’d be bored.  I wrestle with this question every day, every time I stare at that river of workers flowing down the sidewalk.  I’m closely approaching my one year anniversary of the commencement of my Euro hippie adventures.  I’ll tell you one thing, I’ve never felt so alive as I did on those trails.  Ask anyone who’s walked that path and they’ll quickly tell you what I’m talking about.  The interesting aspect of the trip was that I didn’t have a damn thing to do while I was there.  I had neither a sole reason nor a purpose aside from finding food and a place to sleep for the night.  There were definitely some ups and downs on the emotional scale but the truth is I accomplished far more personal growth while on those trips than in the last nine months I’ve been taking an active part in the “real” world.   So what the hell keeps me behind this desk?  What keeps me from living a simple life in a small hut in Thailand?  Maybe it's just that my balls aren't big enough.  It did take some balls to walk the streets of Europe and I probably wouldn’t have done it if Danny didn’t kick me in the balls with his graduation present but I’m sure glad I took on the challenge.  I think next time I see a spam email in my junk folder that reads:  "Want bigger balls?" I may just buy the stupid pills. Maybe then I'll make a real move in my life and stop writing these types of journal entries.  Peace  Waltliquor
