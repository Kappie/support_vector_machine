But finally, after being seduced by friends and the whole Andy Kaufman situation i have started this blog.  I feel this is quite possibly the most awkward time in my life to decide to start a blog aswell, not only have i made a venture into the world of fulltime employment, but i'm about to embark on quite possibly one of the hardest weeks in my life. for next week is the beginning of a series of 8 tests. if i fail, i can't go into further education. you have to understand the pressure involved there. it doesn't help that i don't contribute to solving this problem by revising, and i spend my time writing blogs and messing about with web design, animation and sound editing. Surely i could be doing something more constructive with my time? Surely i could be working, pushing myself towards securing my educational future?  nah. can't be arsed.  To me, if i don't know the facts of by heart, then it never made the click to ensure that i would remember it. For instance, photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is a process that has something to do with plants. thats all i know, words like chlorophyll and the idea of oxygen doing something with leaves buzz around my mind, but mean nothing. i only ever remember things that i feel i NEED to know, or could gain some kind of advantage for knowing in the real world. for instance, in the case of English, this format of memory is a godsend, i remember it all from conjugation to enjambment, it just clicks, but science. bah. what use is knowing about the atomic structure of Nitrous Oxide when i want to advance in the field of computing?  But anyway. this is my blog, i'll try to keep it updated as much as possible, but with tests every other day, and long hours at work i don't think i'll ever get the opportunity to become a real "blogger" and ensure that every post is chockfilled with informative information on the day to day of the author of this blog. me.
