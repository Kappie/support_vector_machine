Like the fact that I spent today in Boston on Newbury St., and came home with new jeans, cd's, a backpack, and a day in the city I love behind me.  Dylan turned on the rebroadcast of tonight's Red Sox game after informing us that they won.  Then he watched a bit, then left, and now I'm here, watching the rebroadcast of a Red Sox game whose outcome I already know, and writing in my blog.  Those cd's, though, are great cd's.  I got them at Mars on Newbury St.  Two of them were used, one new.  They are, in no particular order--  Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Jerome Kern Songbook Bill Evans Trio--Waltz for Debby Bud Powell--The Amazing Bud Powell, Vol. 1  Did I  mention  I'm addicted to jazz?  This guy I know who's going to Berklee in the fall with me brought me a little gift last night, a gift which saved me over $600 in sheet music for the next couple years.  Life is good.  Especially when you're saving money.  Speaking of money, which I don't often do, I'm fairly certain I've got my job on the Spirit of Boston back when I return to Boston in the fall.  I'm reeeeaaaally crossing my fingers, because I need to pay rent.  I'm going to go to bed.  Hoping for a phone call, but I'll live either way. :)
