That game is so funny to me now because i cant help but think that when i was younger, playing that game was fun, there was nothing to hide and therefore no reason not to play. Now that im older its not as easy to share my feelings  or tuths about mebecause it might let someonein deep enough to hurt me. Im the type of person who will hold most emotions inside untill they burst out in some form or another. As i write this i long for the days when i was able to tell my true feelings to someone more than God. I know he is always there and already knows what i may be going through but, I cannot help but wish i could share with someone that is here in the flesh, someone who knows what i go through. Not being able to share with someone on my level has almost left me in a state of emotionless. i can give off the fake emotions and I do, but there is still a longing in my soul for so much more......
