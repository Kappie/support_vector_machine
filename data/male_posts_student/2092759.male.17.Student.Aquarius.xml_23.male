They went and saw Shamu (I'll be damned if I can spell the Whale's name, and im not about to look it up. so there.) and this new breed of Mini-Dolphins at Sea-World.  I hung out with a friend who moved to Florida at the end of last year for most of the weekend. Just chilled and played cards. Watched some movies. Good times. Hes a good guy and he might be moving back out here at the beginning of the year.  O well. Time to go to bed and hope I can get stuff done for my history report tommorrow. Woot for federal holidays.
