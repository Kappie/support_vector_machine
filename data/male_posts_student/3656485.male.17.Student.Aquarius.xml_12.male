What are pre-pubescent youngsters doing with so much caffeine anyhow? Truly I say to you, we are raising a new generation of yuppies and trend followers. Taking a small survey of those awake during the time of this posting I find that a whopping 100% don't truly drink what is commonly known as coffee. Instead we murder the good name of caffeine by plagiarism it under the revamped aliases of frappachino and mocha latte's. Loading these "drinks" with enough sugar to bring about a debate as to whether the "high" comes from caffeine or that cup of caramel you just needed to have added to your three ounces of coffee.  And what ever happened to the good old days when one could go down to the local diner, order a "cup of joe," and sit at a booth to read his local paper? The trendy thing to do now adays is to sit in a crowded cubicle sipping your javas and cuppocinos, seeing who can hold their sugar better. Perhaps we should all start playing more drinking games during these times. Last one to name all 50,000 blends in the shop has to take a triple shot!  I feel aggravated to reminisce back to the days of middle school. To hear all the children brag about how much coffee they drank. It's no freaking wonder that parents don't know how to handle their children. Little Timmy has a hard time concentrating in class! Let's dope him up on some pills to fix everything. Has anyone else noticed how much sugar Americans consume in an average day? The numbers are probably staggering. I myself am included in this group. And in being so, I now realize the importance of distancing myself from too much of this vile... glucose.  A trendy addiction has the youth of America in it's vice. And so I conclude in this littlemonologue, lose the disillusion. Go drink some water for a change. Maybe some milk. By God, half of you are going to end up with osteo perosis...  Tune in next time for another edition of... Chris Ch@! (Oh Lenny...)
