This past week we lost a great scientist and I think his work encompasses a lot of the themes Dave hit on.  It is not difficult for one to imagine that the discovery made by Watson and Crick could easily lead to abuse, inappropriate manipulation and ownership.  I also wanted to hit on the theme of deception and distortion to evoke fear.  It's in MCP's hands now. urlLink
