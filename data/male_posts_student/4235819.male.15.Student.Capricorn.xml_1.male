I saw Blog with some Arabic dialect, one with Chinese symbols, and one with Japanese symbols.  Just think of the possibilities this opens up!  We could make a UN blog!  We could solve world relations with the click of a mouse and the push of a button!  All we need is some high-quality translation HTML, about forty expert linguists for moderators, and knowledge of several different languages for e-mail contacts, and we'd be set.  How's THAT for a vision?
