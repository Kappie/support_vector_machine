However, we got there kind of late... so it didn't happen, but we met up with Naomi, Mike (Stephanie's sister's boyfriend) and his friends... so we ended up bouncing around all over LA checking stuff out. It was fun. I had actually, kind of talked to Mike before on the Weezer message boards before so it was cool to meet him. His friends from USC were pretty cool. I found the Turkish guy pretty funny... cause he was so much like the other Turks back in Binghamton... just slightly less cool.  Gonna have dinner with my girls from Cambridge later tonight, but before that... I'm gonna watch some T2 and Undercover Brother.  Listening to the  Ramones  today.  ****
