Too bad I'm not in Seattle.  I would just walk to the corner.  Oh, by the way, I am taking Christmas orders for chocolate chip cookies, so if ya want some, let me know! Well I'm gonna hit the sack here in a few, after CSI (rerun) is over.   Good night, good night, farewell to thee.  In the morn, in the morn, you I shall see.  Over and out~
