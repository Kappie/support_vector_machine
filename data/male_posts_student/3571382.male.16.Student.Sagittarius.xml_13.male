Tommy, Jason, and Carl went on vacation and wont be back for like 8 days and they SUCK for it because they're like the only guys I hang out with besides Corey :(. Jamie turned 16 today and got his license. And from what I hear from my brother, he's a pretty crazy driver. Crazier than me? Of course not. I wouldn't actually know though because I WASN'T INVITED. I know you read this Jamie, I drive you everywhere and you leave me here to be bored as all hell :(. I really love Linkin Park. They're like my outlet if I need really loud music instead of my normal pop punk/emo stuff. I was looking at ringtones to spice something up a bit and I found Lover I Don't Have To Love but it's a totally sucky one, they didn't do it very well.     I really hate the night. As I told Sam earlier, it's like 9084390478981278912374029302178 times harder to stay content with what I have than during the day.    Good night people.    --Aaron
