Rhonda was hoping to see Allison's mom there, because she's actually speaking out now, trying to educate people about the dangers of railroad tracks. After, we went into Dairy Queen. It was fun just to hang out with those guys. I miss Jason and Clayton. They're fun guys. Clayton is working at Boston Pizza still. Jason is in college. Who's have thought he'd be the first one there? Actually, it makes sense, because he's really the only one who knows exactly what he wants to do. I got my Kiros pics back today. They should be in the SHOW REVIEWS section of my page later today. Go check right now to see!!! Afterwards, I went back to Crystals. It was a good night. Sometimes I like nights like that, too.   urlLink  postCount('2002november2');
