That book is pretty crazy when you actually think about some of the stuff that goes on.  Especially how the main character subjects some people to police brutality, and how clipped peoples emotions are towards things.    After re-reading that, I've decided weird books are the best.  So hopefully, tommorow, I'll go to the Library and get "Snow Crash" (which I learned about via the Library Website).  A book about a guy who works for the Mafia controlled Pizza Delivery Chain "La Cosa Nostra" and is the best Sword Fighter in the World, while also being one of the best people in the Matrix.  I mean, that seems normal enough.  Shrimp.  It's been a contest between that and Toaster Struddles.  I think I've decided that Toaster Struddles win.  I guess I decided that at legal sea food yesterday....   BRINE SHRIMP.   Okay, I'm better.  But sea food in general is weird, but anything for daddy dearest birthday.   Una otra punto de vista  Dad bought the other two boondocks books but being who he is he has hoarded them.  Weirdo.    I really wish I could write like Gibson, or R. A. Wilson.  But alas, I don't have the white people writting powers.  So, I guess I'll have to settle for those African writers like umm... Achebe and that guy who wrote "Wretched of the Earth".
