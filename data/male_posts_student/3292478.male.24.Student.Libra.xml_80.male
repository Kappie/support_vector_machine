I found the documentary very interesting, in particular the way it gave an interesting twist on the  nature/nurture  debate, as well as to how certain aspects of American society can moralise killing when it suits their own means.  Looking at Nick's  urlLink website  made me realise how little I actually knew about his work, other than the highly publicised  urlLink Aileen Wuornos ,  urlLink Kurt  Courtney , and the  urlLink Biggie  Tupac  documentarys.  Thats my web viewing sorted for the next week!
