Now it's weasel. So if you just understood whatever the hell I just said, cheers for you. Here's the stuff!  Chip  Kim – The number one placing is very much undeserved. They have shown before that they are incapable of making flight arrangements. This week, they got lucky because Colin went all out to help everyone but Mirna. The thing is, you can’t depend on someone every leg, and you won’t be number one on the finishing line just because you can eat caviar.  Colin  Christie – I think they are one of the most strategic players to ever be in this game. They, along with Brandon  Nicole, see Charla  Mirna as threats and decided it would be best to try and bring them down. I really don’t like Colin’s dirty play, but it’s a really smart strategic move to try and get Charla  Mirna out early. Really, really bad choice getting a girl to eat when there’s a guy in the team. Guys are always stronger at these eating things… Just look at Fear Factor! Christie’s emerging as really bitchy. I know you’re all frustrated at having to eat salt, but no need to take it out on your boyfriend and another team!  Marshall  Lance – Same thing as Chip  Kim. These two got lucky with Colin playing dirty. You’re just pawns in his game, so watch out. I thought the “Don’t talk to me!” comment at the bus station when Mirna tried to ask you a question was really uncalled for. I mean, Mirna was actually trying to be nice and you told her to shut her trap. As the only other guy to have eaten the caviar, you really let your team down by doing it so much slower than Chip. I love it when you declared to everyone when they asked whether placings were still being respected, shows that you’re actually thinking of ways to get ahead. From then on, you just rode the “Colin help” wagon. According to the spoilers which have been accurate so far, these two go next week… Let’s continue hoping!  Charla  Mirna – Rock on gals! These two looked to be in huge trouble this time, but they managed to save themselves again. They have proved that they can survive independently, without any alliances and without any help from others. I really respect them for that, but a few friends won’t do any harm. Mirna is getting on my nerves, but I like Charla too much to make this team budge from my number one spot. As I said in my summary, I don’t know if they had secured on the connecting flight through Germany or just got lucky. If they indeed secured the Germany connecting flight, they’re the flight supremos this season. The editors very unhelpfully forgot to tell us when the Swiss Air flight would arrive compared to Colin  Christie’s flight. The editors might be trying to downplay them, lest they stick out as the winners this season because of their superior flight arranging skills.  Brandon  Nicole – I hate their strategy so badly, and it doesn’t seem to work. They make alliances that they know they will not keep, and benefit without benefiting others. I also hate the way that they keep proclaiming to be Christians. Christie said something to the effect of them being Christian, but they will be ruthless when it comes to competition. Something about playing well. It’s like saying “I’m Christian, but I will not hesitate to lie, cheat and steal…” What a hypocrite! Brandon, they one doing all the lying to alliances, states that he wants to live as an example to others, so won’t drink the vodka. So your living example would be to backstab whenever necessary? Stop contradicting yourselves, and stop reminding us you’re Christian! The fact that we know you’re Christian, and yet see you backstab people week after week is enough!  Linda  Karen – Queerly, we didn’t see much of them this episode. Maybe they’re not as interesting as I initially thought they were. I actually thought they are the female versions of Ken  Gerard, but now it doesn’t seem so much like it. They don’t have much skills in finding flights. I mean, Charla  Mirna jumped right to the front again with their skills, but you couldn’t? You’re losing your entertainment value in this season, and you’re not a very proficient team at the race. Your leaving would make more space for the more interesting teams to show!  Kami  Karli – Second to last, again? This teams physical capabilities has pulled them through so far, but their lack of brains will pull them down eventually. I really can’t say much about this team, cause they haven’t really been featured much. I admire the fact that they one doing the Roadblock was shivering when she was done. It was a much better reaction than giving up and sleeping like the other prom queens. Sheer grit and determination is what got her through. The comment about “We hate getting pushed back already” was a redundant statement. If you don’t like getting pushed back, do something about it…  Bob  Joyce – Awww… Last week I said that I was beginning to see why my friend liked them so much., and this week they are eliminated. I did say that they weren’t showing much character and will need to go if they stay this boring, but I didn’t mean this soon! Joyce ate the caviar fast, and she can be counted as a prom queen cause she’s a skinny female. She didn’t even flinch! We didn’t exactly see Joyce finish the caviar, so I kind of think the producers were kind enough to tell her that they’d already been eliminated. Bob’s words to her on the horse carriage sounded as if she was on her deathbed traveling around the world… Err… I don’t think I should be so mean to such a loving couple. I sincerely wish them good luck on their relationship, cause they look like they’re going to be a real happy couple together.
