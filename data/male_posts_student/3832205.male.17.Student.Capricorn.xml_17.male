It was mainly pink, since she loves the color pink, with feathers and colored cotton ball things all over it. For the letter itself I used those letter sticker things instead of writing it which looked really good and matched the look. For the cover I bought this big foam thing which was 3 flowers and bees. I had so many sweet ideas, but I couldnt do them all, I ran out of supplys, so I couldn't even do everything I wanted to. No biggie, the point still got accross, that I truley care, and I made her smile for her first time all day.   *Oh it had white hearts and stuff too, and a design for the outer trim, pretty sweet lookin if you ask me.*  Love ya Laura. :)             Great thoughts to end with in your head befor i'm gone to Chicago :-/
