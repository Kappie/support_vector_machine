But yesterday I did meet Helen and Charl after school at the station for a good ol' chat. That was fun, and Dave has had his piano exam and soon to have his flute exam, which with any luck my 'rents shall buy him Splinter Cell 2 for all the hard work.  I'm finding myself in need of more and more money with all these awesome (yes, they're that good, awesome, eyy) games coming out, I plan to get  urlLink Harvest Moon: The Wonderful Life , and also Dave just bought  urlLink Deus Ex 2: The Invisible War , and I plan to buy the essence of Jon's older computer when he comes back, 'coz he's just upgraded his with his birthday money.  Well, that's all from me until sunday (I'm guessing Sunday anyway, I seem to have made a routine of it)
