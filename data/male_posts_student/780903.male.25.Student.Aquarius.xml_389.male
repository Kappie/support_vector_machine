"Your honor, the defendant corporation posted on its website an article concerning the Texas activities of a Texas resident, relying in part on a Texas source, and anticipating possible harm to be felt in Texas.  Given these facts, it makes little sense not to allow Texas to exert jurisdiction."    That's my first two sentences.  Wouldn't you rule in my favor?
