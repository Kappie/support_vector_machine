The  last  chatper (ironically called  A Crown of Swords ) give way to how the book got it's name. Basically, the crown of Illian ( a city in the book) has little swords on it. On the cover of the next book it's the thing on top of Rand's head.  Anyway, I think I have to go to this camp thing in a second, so I'll go ahead and be getting ready. Guess I won't get to start on my book as soon as I thought.
