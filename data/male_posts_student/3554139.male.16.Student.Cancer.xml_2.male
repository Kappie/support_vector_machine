The whole situation is iffy, you know? After they broke up, Caleb told me and my other friend Joel about how she still treats him and calls him her boyfreind. I approached her with this and she said he hadn't even talked to her since they broke up.   I don't really want any part in this, but I got that IM from Caleb this morning. He asked me to ask Maggs some questions. And use my "master persuaion and perception" to figure out what's going on with her. So I told him no way. But I want to help him out still. I feel like I'm betraying him by not doing this..Maggs has been acting differently lately.   Also, I'm sick of people. I have somewhat of a social life, but I'd prefer not to. As in: I have people who follow me around, and won't leave me alone. It's slowly depleating though, as when I graduated grade eight, I could count all of my good friends on two hands, and now I can only count them on one. Not counting the five to ten morons who just won't leave me alone. And I'm sick of them. All of them. They're all the kind of people to say what they're told to say, and like..Think what they think it would be cool to think, and buy what they're told to want. It drives me crazy. One of them came to my house yestarday without calling or anything. I wouldn't have been furious on two conditions..  a) My mom wasn't in an extremely horrible mood b) it wasn't Sean.  That guy..Oh, I'm not going to get started on him. Maybe later I'll dedicate a whole post to him, or something. Not right now.  Wherever I stand right now..I'm fucking fed up with everything. Thankfully I'm not depressed, (not going there again) but it looks like I could be heading there.   Hillary might be coming today. My girlfriend. Maybe I'll dedicate a whole post to her later too, but not now. She lives in town, but she's on the outskirts. And since I'm not quite 16 yet, (40-something more days!) I don't have a car. So I only get to see her once a week or so. She doesn't go to my school, either. Gah, because she's in grade eight. Whatever. I'm in grade ten. Not that big of an age difference.  I'm about done posting..Might post later today, but I seriousely doubt it.   The reason I have this blog is because I don't want to be fake anymore. I have another blog, (http://www.livejournal.com/users/plouder95/ Don't bother reading it, it may be funny, but it's phony as hell) But it's fake. I act all cheery, and all of that all the time. I piss myself off. Maybe I'm just tired.  Adios,  -Steve
