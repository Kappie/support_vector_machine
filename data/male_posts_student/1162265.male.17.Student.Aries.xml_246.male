U.S. Denies Iran Report Of Bin Laden's Capture  By Reuters,  March 4, 2004   The U.S. Department of Defense recently denied reports by Iran's official IRNA news agency on Saturday that al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden has been captured.   IRNA quoted a story on Iran's state radio Pashtun service which reported "a very reliable source" as saying bin Laden had been captured in a tribal area of Pakistan.   A senior U.S. defense official denied the report, telling Reuters it was "another piece of stray voltage that's passing around out there."   And Pakistan's Foreign Minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri told a news conference he was aware of the Iranian report, but added: "We cannot confirm it at all."   Washington says bin Laden masterminded the September 11, 2001, suicide hijack attacks in the United States, which killed nearly 3,000 people.   The Iranian correspondent responsible for the report told Reuters the radio had also reported bin Laden's capture a year ago. But said a new source had told him on Friday the al Qaeda leader had been seized "a long time ago."   "It could be one month ago, it could be one year, but he has been arrested," he said.   While declining to reveal his source or how his source knew of the capture, he said: "My source said it and he knows it."   Pakistani troops earlier this week arrested 20 suspects in an operation against al Qaeda and Taliban militants in South Waziristan. Officials said none were leading al Qaeda militants.   The U.S. military said this month that U.S.-led troops in Afghanistan were moving toward coordinated operations along the border -- "a hammer and anvil approach" -- to prevent fleeing al Qaeda fighters from escaping simply by crossing from one country into the other.   Pakistan, a key ally in the U.S.-led war on terror, has stepped up efforts in recent weeks against al Qaeda and Taliban fighters as the 10,600-strong U.S. force in Afghanistan gears up for a spring offensive against Islamic militants.  .
