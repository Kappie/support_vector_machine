So I took out a stack of papers Lao Er dug out while clearing the room last night, and started drawing. Did a few circles shading, and got kinda bored with back  white. Pouring out what's in my pencil case, I've got a blue pen, yellow highlighter, 0.1 drawing marker and a red colouring pencil.    TaDa~
