I managed to get yelled at by several different teachers today, for reasons I have yet to understand.  Now I got badminton. Another chance to smash the living crap out of a load of yr9's. Trogdor strikes again!  Oh, and ha ha Jack, Flyers 0, yes, thats right, 0, Tampa Bay 1. Not even Mr Roenick could stand up to those Lightning hits! Bwahahahahaha!  Oh, nearly forgot. Jack seems to have finally lost that last bit of sanity. He was trying to hold Nat's bag hostage "until she agreed to his terms and conditions". Of course she didn't. She probably didn't even notice he'd taken it. I think Jack needs to spend a liiiiittle more time in the 'planning' phase of his little ideas.
