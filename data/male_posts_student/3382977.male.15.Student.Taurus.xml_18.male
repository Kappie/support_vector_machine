Ruslan Fedotenko scored twice, including the critical first goal just as he did in the conference finals, and the resilient Lightning held off the Calgary Flames 2-1 in Game 7 Monday night to win their first Stanley Cup."   first the sharks are out..and i loose hope in them, and then my good ole flames loose...oh well      its a beauty
