Just coz i'm lazy to take out my diary out of my bag and told them that i left it in class, and i got myself in a deep pile of shit. If only GPK didn't see me, i'll be happy now. For your info, i skipped detention as well. Who gives a damn, i mean, they(the skool)wannaus to study for the O s, yet they pose a lot of problems to us. How ironical. Yesterday, everyone from SEC 2 3 4 had to go down to the National Stadium to support our track team. Their excuse was that this is the closest that the track team had got in beatin the GIANTS in the track events. WADDAHELL? We didn't even win gold! Plus, why can't the school hire some professional cheerleaders? They're good, better than us. I'm pretty sure the skool's rich, just stingy.        Calculation on how money the skool sucked out of the students every year:    1 person= (12months X $150/monthly) + $200 Miscellaneous Fee     =$2000    Each class consists ofapproximately 30 people    Each level consists of 12 classes    Therefore, total amount of money= $2000 X 30people X 12classes per level X 4 levels   = $2880000, $2.88million a year!!! (excludin foreigners who pay $300a month)         Bloody shitheads........
