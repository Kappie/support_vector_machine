Father did not work today. O.O! Right. Even we ate laksa during lunch. Yes!  I went to collect my Charmed: The Book of Three (The Complete Companion to the Hit Show) from WRL. I met HL, PY and SL there. O.O!!  Right. I came back and started on my 1200-words book review. I am doing Huan Zhu Ge Ge, the first part. HaHa! I spent lots and lots of time working on that work. I have to keep calling CQ to ask how to write/express words. Heh. I also have to keep checking the three books on the content.  Also, I was pretty distracted by fanfics. This fic,  urlLink Harry Potter And The Jade Dragon , (a non-slash fic this time! O.O) actually captivated my attention because it has lots of Chinese origins in it. Yes!   Right. That was a major distraction. Of course, I worked for 9 hours on that 1500-words (yes..I managed to wrote extra 300 words) book review, which I fell was quite sucky.   Yesterday was also the first time I put "Away" in my MSN Messenger for the whole day. HaHa! I really felt "Away" lor. Even the cat is away today. Okay.    Today   I woke up at 5am to watch that Jap show. Guess what? It did not play today!! I mistook Wednesday for Monday....and sigh. Woke up for nothing!   Okay. Today in GP, there's a cause for celebration! Mr Jeremy actually thinks my counter-argument is very good! I finally got affirmation from me! I have been waiting for that 'Exactly!' for ages! :P  Right. The arugment I was supposed to counter goes something like banning porn because it has a chance to lead to crimes (sex crimes or otherwise). I countered by saying that pens might as well be banned, because their pointed tips have a chance to cause hurt to people should it fall into the wrong hands. Then, you might as well ban all things on Earth, since they are dangerous and have a chance to lead to crime. Mr Jeremy actually thinks it is good! :D   Right. That very 'patriotic' MCP actually thinks that the media should shield our government and protect its reputation when it did something wrong! AYIOH! Complete rubbish! Our government opening practises transparency. Even if that LKY committed a crime, his case should be covered as extensively as any other politician who has committed a crime. Okay, maybe more la. After all, he is Senior PM. Anyhoo, lets nhot talk about this. MCP is a silly duck.   Okay. I got my Physics results back. I failed with an F! AYIOH!! So terrible! Sigh.  Okay. Today got choir. YaY! I am very happy in choir today. I managed to pitch quite accurately. I am so happy. :)  Okay. That's all lor. See ya next time. TaTa! Night blog!
