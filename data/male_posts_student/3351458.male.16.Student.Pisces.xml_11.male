Today, I will attempt to “relive” my “painful” moments. Head… This will have to be the time a South Korean boy whacked a ball straight at my face. It especially hurt my nose because I was bespectacled that time. All I remember was going in for the challenge and the next thing I know, I was on the ground clutching my face with a specs a few metres away from me. Backbone… Ahh, this one happened recently enough. Sitting on a railing and being at peace with the world has some consequences in this modern era. (Snort!) Somehow or the other, I slip and fall over backwards head first. There was a nice little thud when my head connected with the concrete floor. I flipped over and sat there without moving for the next ten minutes because I sincerely thought I had broken my back. Until today, when I sit up straight, my backbone hurts. No prizes for guessing who’ll be a hunchback by the age of 30. Left Hand… Another Sri Lankan moment. Our old apartment had a very solid and thick black door. A solid wooden one. As we lived near the sea, the wind was always ferocious. And once, the wind was about the blow the door shut. An 11-year old me kindly stuck out his left hand to stop it from slamming, but apparently I miscalculated the strength of the wind, and the door slammed shut on my fingers. Right Hand... Playing goalkeeper, for a few moments I thought I was in the boots of Peter Schmeichel. While saving (or attempting to save, anyway) a shot, some clown managed to hook the ball away using all his might. Trouble is, that particular clown hooked my hand along with it. The hand swelled to twice it’s normal size, and this was during my LTC. I spent the rest of that LTC with a bandaged right hand. Leg… Nope, nothing serious here I can recall. I’m having a minor one right now which was, again, caused while playing goalkeeper (is God trying to tell me I’m not meant to be keeper?). Collided with a classmate of mine then landed awkwardly. Foot… This happened when I was a little kid. My sis was having fun pressing the stapler, watching the staples fly here and there. I was unaware, and I jumped off a table right onto one of those staples, which went and stuck itself on my foot. Mind you, there was some trouble getting it out, and even harder to walk with two holes on my foot… I will keep this blog posted if I get seriously injured anytime soon…
