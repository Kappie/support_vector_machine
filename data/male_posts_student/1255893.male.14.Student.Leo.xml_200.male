Am I right, Johnny? =p  Only 21 schooldays left. Then again, we have one week off, so that's 17. Also, we use a day for the cram session, another for the luncheon, and still another for finals.... So we're only looking at two weeks of any actual learning or work, as far as core goes anyway. Good times =).
