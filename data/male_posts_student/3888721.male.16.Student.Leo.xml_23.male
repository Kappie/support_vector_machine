This person has always been there for us, teaching us, but everyday pass by without him complaining about how tired he is. Mr Lim Beng Huat is one of the most efficient and hardworking i have even seen in my entire life. Please don't be mistaken that other teachers don't work that hard also, they do, just that Mr Lim really gives his all for his students. I still remember the first time he came into the class and  introduced himself as our form teacher for these 2 years. My first impression of him was strict and serious, and he meant business. However, he is not just a person who is strict and serious all his life. There are also times that he would laugh and joke with us. During lessons, he would prepare mathematics notes compiled from the 3 Maths textbook used in Sinagapore, be it A.maths or E.maths. Every lesson, he gives 200% for the class. Rain or shine, he would always be there to help and assist us. The notes he compiled are easy to understand, and if we understand a small part of the chapter, he would compile additional notes to aid us. Examples from the notes are taken from both TYS and textbook, and therefore, while learning, we are also practising past year questions. He is also very keen on giving us a lot of homework and papers to practice, and this means more work for him. However, some people just do not understand the hard work and effort that he puts in and constantly piss him off(e.g. never do their work). He has this red file that records the people who hand in and never hand in their work. Even though some of them constantly piss him off, like that Hong Kong Bastard, he never gave up on them, and keep on hoping that they would turn over a new leaf and start to get serious in doing their work. I respect a lot of teachers in my life, but no one as much as Mr Lim. Sometimes, when we do something wrong that makes him go real mad, he would just scold us. After scolding us, he continues with his lessons. How many people could go very mad at one time and still have the mood and energy to continue with lessons? Not alot...not alot. Today marked the day where he completed our syllabus, which meant, we would not see anymore of his notes. This also meant that we would not learn any more mathematics stuff under him. Today marked the day where he had finished what he was supposed to do, and it all depends on us now. I just want to say a big thank you for Mr Lim for guiding us these 2 years, and therefore, i have dedicated this entry to him. For now, to repay the hard work he had put in these 2 years for me and the class, we just had to study hard and show him by getting the results he always expected from us, as a mean of repaying him for the effort that he had put in for us.
