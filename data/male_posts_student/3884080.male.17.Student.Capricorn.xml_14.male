For starters all the bands rocked, i got the guitarists pick from the f-ups, i got my picture with #2 from anti-flag, i got my picture with the bassist from Taking Back Sunday, i got my picture with the guitarist from the f-ups. It was so awesome all the bands rocked, i saw The F-Ups, Anti-Flag, Rufio, Avenged Sevenfold (from afar), and i saw Alkaine Trio, thats where the warped tour got very unique. Alkaline Trio was amazing the crowd was so pumped and jumping around and crowd surfing and get so crazy the security guards were just pulling people out. Well when matt skiba came up to the front of that stage i was going to take a picture so i raised my camera and all of a sudded BAM, the next thing i remember was standing up off the ground and yelling for a security guard to pull me out of the crowd. It turns out a crowd surfer kicked me in the back of the head so hard i blacked out and instantly fell to the ground. after i got taken out of the crowd they took me over to the paramedics, they asked me all of the questions, were do i live, how old am i, whos my parents. and i after i told them they put a neck brace on me and strapped me to a board and took me to the hospital in the ambulence. They had to take me to the hospital because since i blacked out and had pains in my neck they thought i could have internal bleeding (from what the doctor told me). So when i got to the hospital i had to get about 8 x-rays of my neck and then i had to get a catscan for my head. Thank god nothing was seriously wrong, they found that my neck muscles are all stuck together and are pinching all the nerves in my neck but other than that i will have a stiff neck and pain for a couple of days nothing really to worry about. Wayne and Kurt came to the hospital and we all had to wait before they would discharge me. Overall i was at the hospital for about 4 hours and 45 min. On they way home though i got a super taco :)
