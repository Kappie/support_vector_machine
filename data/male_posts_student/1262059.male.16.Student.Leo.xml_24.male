I would've dragged you out of the com lab... ah... you can get the Guidance thingy some other time.. it's not often that people teach you how to fall ^^;;; IMO, that self-defense thingy they teach us is turning out better than I thought...   Now that I've confused people with my brief dose of non-sensical-ness and weirdness, I will go poof now... *poof*   ~Chronos...till the end of Time
