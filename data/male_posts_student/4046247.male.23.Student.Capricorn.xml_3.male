I just want to say that I really appreciate thecontent of the speech given byPresident Carter at the Democratic Convention last night.He and other Democratshave consistently raised important criticisms of the Bush Administration's method of initiatiating and conducting the war in Iraq.      I supported the Iraq war two years ago--and I support it even today --becauseof my belief in human rights. In the fall of 2002 and then in the spring of 2003, I reasoned that, no matter the Bush Administration's true motives for intervention, humanity would be best served by the removal of Saddam Hussein from power.Christians, in my opinion, always have an obligation to oppose and combatdictatorships.       Dr. Bernard Kouchner, the founder of Doctors WithoutBorders and of Doctors of the World(whom I had the greatprivilege of hearing speak in March 2003),has had the most admirable position on Iraq from the beginning.Kouchnersharply criticizes European leaders for their apparent lack of concern about Saddam's human rights abuses, yet is balanced and alsocriticizes the Bush Administration for: (1) failing to provide concrete evidence of Iraqi weapons of mass destructionto the United Nations;and,(2) going to war in the face ofMessieurs Blix and al-Baradei's reports of Iraqi compliance with U.N. inspection regimes, andSaddam's (grudging) destruction of al-Samoud missiles. Kouchner, whose convoy in Kurdistan was once fired upon by Iraqi troops,and whopersonally witnessed the carnage at Halabja,recognizes the bitter ambiguities and ironiesof the Iraqi question.Ideeply respect and appreciate this.     (I am a law student at the University of Texas and I am 23 years old. Ibelieve in the study of law-- although I am not very good at it -- and in the role of the law, particularly the English common law, in the development of democratic and representative governments. Still,even though I do not believe thatI amfrittering away my time in an epoch of national crisis, I acknowledge and am not oblivious to the difficultyof supporting a political line that, of consequence,calls upon othersto make the ultimate sacrifice.)      Bush has to go. The Iraq war has certainlygenerated a morally beneficialresult, but there are too many things about its execution that were faulty. (I'm not saying t  hat a multilaterally-initiated liberation of Iraq would have been more succesful, and would have been more readily accepted bythe Sunni, Shia, Kurds, Iraqi Christians, and Turkomen. In my view, Iraq's ethnic, tribal, economic and religious divisions are, at least for the foreseeable future, an indelible feature of the country's political landscape, with which any intervention/reorganization would inevitably havehad to reckon.) I'm not blaming Bush for everything, mind you! Any Iraq war, no matter howprosecuted, was bound to open a Pandora's box of crises. All I'm saying is thatthe Presidenthas set us back.Our "go it alone" attitudehas only bredhatred for our country and made it harderto win the genuineloyalty of others.       It's time for a change in the Oval Office. No more faultily prosecuted Iraq wars! No more irresponsible tax cuts and economic overstimulation! No more scuttling ofinternational compacts like the Kyoto Accords!WeHAVEto lead by example when it comes to the environment, even if India and Chinastubbornly resist changes that would reduce the megacloud of pollution that hangs oversouthern and eastern Asia.      GO DEMOCRATS!
