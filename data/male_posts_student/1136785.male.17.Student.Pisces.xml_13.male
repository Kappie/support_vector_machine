To quote Owen Glendower from  Henry IV Part I :  "Give me leave To tell you once again that at my birth The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes, The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields. These signs have mark'd me extraordinary; And all the courses of my life do show I am not in the roll of common men. Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales, Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me? And bring him out that is but woman's son Can trace me in the tedious ways of art And hold me pace in deep experiments"  Dayuumn! I'm either stupidly arrogant or arrogantly stupid - perhaps both. Either way, hooray!  Wow, seventeen years...this is astounding. I remember when I was ten as if it was right now, but somehow I'm seventeen. This lightning quick pace of the passage of time is somewhat frightening and comforting. The constant imposition of a boundary that my own mortality places is always a scary thought, but it is not for me to avoid the reaper - just to live as well as I can until the inevitable. I can find comfort in the fact that no matter what, I am going to die. I have no choice in the issue, so why fear it? And just to throw off those who think I may have found inner peace, I'll let slip the light of my own insecurity - Who knows, I could break the curve. Fuck, I'm falling behind in my readings. I need to finished with near east history and onto 'In search of Modern China' by the time I leave tomorrow.   Also, I decided to throw in another movie review. I saw 'Secret Window' ( THE SHINING ) yesterday with a delightful little group and a hot dog. Secret Window ( THE SHINING ) was good. Its plot ( THE SHINING ) twists were so ( THE SHINING ) unexpected. Johnny Depp (JACK NICHOLSON IN  THE SHINING )  is such a good ( THE SHINING ) actor. If only he could ( THE SHINING ) get more ( THE SHINING ) roles. Alack, ( THE SHINING ), for Hollywood doesn't recognize ( THE SHINING ) greatness. John ( THE SHINING ) Tuttoro was also ( THE SHINING ) quite good. He is so convincing as ( THE SHINING ) a mississippian! I wonder if he ( THE SHINING ) has ever visited ( THE SHINING ) the great state of ( THE SHINING ) Mississippi or its neighbors? Overall, ( THE SHINING ) this may be the greatest movie since ( THE SHINING ) Hildalgo.   [PS: If you didn't catch my sarcasm, in which case makes me question your ability to properly use the internet and theorize that you are likely some cat playng on the keyboard- or perhaps an incredibly smart ficus- Secret Window sucked. It was contrived, stupid, boring, and a rip off of, GASP, the Shining - which is especially sad from the same author. Someone told me that Secret Window was written before the Shining, which makes me questions the need of a movie of a proto-Shining anyway. The only scary part was when it took a Buried Child turn for the worse with corn at the end. I'm still shaking. The people I saw it with are still cool though, if slightly tainted.]
