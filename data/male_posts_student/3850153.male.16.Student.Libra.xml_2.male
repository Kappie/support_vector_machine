We sat around and talked about the nets not being up until we realized there was a snake very close to where we were sitting. This had a detrimental effect on our wanting to say there, so we left. A few hours I had the honor of attending The Doobie Brothers Live at DTE. They were, of course, amazing (even more so due to the incredible seats we had) and a good time was had by all. Saturday, I drove myself to Farmington to be in their Founders Parade for State representing Gilda Jacobs, handing out candy and the like. I think our message was well received especially since the Republican candied in front of us only had stickers. Ryan, Kirk and myself rented "The Borne Identity" and I judged it to be of fair quality. I think we're going to see the sequel this week, which promises to be "action filled" and what not.
