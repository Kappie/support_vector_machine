My source material, though, promises to be more entertaining than case law.  As I wrap up law school, I now have time to read the stack of  Foreign Affairs  and  Political Science Quarterly  books on my shelf...  ...and the  ABA Journal ... the  Texas Bar Journal ... the  Baylor Law Review ...  ... and issues of  The Economist ...  The New Yorker ...  The Atlantic ... the  Harvard Business Review ...  Legal Affairs ...  ... and back copies of the  MIT Technology Review ...  Wired Magazine ...  PC World ...   Digital Videomaker ...  ... and of course the  Yale Alumni Magazine ... the  NYC Yale Club Newsletter ... the  Dallas Yale Club Newsletter ... the  Mory's Newsletter ...  Baylor Magazine ...  Docket Call ...  ... and others that slip my mind.  These readings have been awaiting me.  Perhaps my plan to pursue all six concentrations at Baylor Law was ill-advised.  The logic has been to delay other indulgences in favor of attaining my education now.  The magazines will be available for quite some time, but I have only one chance to pursue a formal legal education.  So the magazines taunted me.  But no longer...  I have to include a bit of variety, so I may reference the occasional video game magazine.  Matthew Alexander's work at  American Thunder , and my resulting subscription, will lead to some interesting observations.  My steady stream of  National Geographic  issues may yield random ramblings, as will the endless reams of junk mail.  Despite all the magazines to which I subscribe, I do intend to spark discussion of meaningful literature.  John Irving, Jack Kerouac, and their ilk glare at me from another bookshelf in my spare bedroom.  I expect much ribbing about my subscription to the  Harvard Classics  series from the Easton Press.  Yet for all this reading, I hope to promote discussions among friends and to enjoy the fellowship I discovered in college.  With distance and varying schedules conspiring to separate us, I think this may be the best method of staying close with one another.  This site is meant to supplement Hollando.com, which serves as a collection of photographs and blurbs about the people, places, and events I encounter in my life.  The Hollando Blog treats a different set of meetings... meetings for which there will not be photographs... meetings with the great writers, the hack journalists, the parade of authors who offer glimpses into the world around us.  Hollando.com is a self-mocking, jubilant jaunt through my life, always tinged with irony.  The Hollando Blog will be a chance to offer more than mockery.  I will need your help to make this endeavor worthwhile.
