I’ve been reflecting a lot on who I am right now as opposed to who I was several years ago. I guess it’s fitting since I graduate in a few weeks. I’ve come to the realization that I’m much more cynical and foreboding now than I ever was in the past. I don’t really think that’s a good thing.  It’s a materialistic world out there. So I just stopped caring as a response. I’ve realized that and I find myself to be a cold individual right now as a result of that… or at least on the inside. I still go out and have fun with friends. I still enjoy life; however, on the inside… many of my desires and ideals have stopped burning brightly. I think that’s why the thought of an enduring romantic relationship seems ridiculous to me. That’s probably why I found that stuff in the films I’ve been watching to be meaningless. That’s probably why I’m feeling so apathetic right now about grad school and my future. I wouldn’t say that I’m pessimistic to the point of not having hope at all, but simply at this juncture, I have no lofty dreams like I did several years ago.   That’s pretty much my ramble. I should try to go to bed again.  *
