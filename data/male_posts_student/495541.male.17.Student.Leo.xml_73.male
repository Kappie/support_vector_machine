I'll never be able to explain these dreams... they're always so vague and just plain weird.  I remember having the same type dreams when I was much younger, back in California.  These dreams make me fear for my life.  Hard to explain, but it's just scary.  I ened up watching tv for a few minutes just to calm myself down a bit.  Homecoming was tonight.  I had a good time.  Some things were just bad, mainly my own fault... none of which I'd like to talk about.  But damn... I can't dance.  Hope you have a good night.  Song of the night: "#41" (Dave Matthews Band) ... "I wanted to stay, I wanted to play... I wanted to love youuuuu..."  Great song.  Heh. :-)
