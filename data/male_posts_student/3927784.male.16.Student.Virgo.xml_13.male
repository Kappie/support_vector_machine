Martin said to me that he enjoyed reading them, and its things like that that give me ideas of what to write. So thanks to Martin for that. And after other feedback, and people acting differently when we went out Sunday night, i've decided to do a small change to the immaturity table. Infact, i might do it every week depending on what happens.  So here is the table after Sunday night:   1) Ross!   2) Joe   3)Sam  yes these three have swopped around because Sam started to behave...it actually impressed me! And he was even more maturer than Joe. Joe wasnt there so its a bit unfair on him, but based on how i think he would behave, i'm gonna have to go with this.  4)   Andrew/Mark/Martin/Jason/Craig  I'm gonna have to add the rest of us into one category because i must say, on Sunday, we all seemed more grown up. And before you even think about it, i know Jason wasnt there, but like i said i want to put everyone in one category. And....AND.....theres even talk about us going to Bournemouth, so theres some points to be scored in that week. By the way, if anyone disagrees where i am in the table, then tell me and i'll consider changing my ranking. Oh and you might of seen that Mike isnt in the table. Simply because i doubt we'll be seeing him untill we're back at college.  Anyway, moving on, i thought i'd let you know about how my work is going...if you want to leave now because you have no interest then go ahead because i'm not gonna be writing anything else. I'm gonna make this as quick, short, painless and informative as possible..... Works good, goes quite quick, i'm trying to work as much as possible to earn more money, everyones kool there.......and i like working there, and i stack shelves, lol. Thats it.   So i'll try and return another day this week, if not next week
