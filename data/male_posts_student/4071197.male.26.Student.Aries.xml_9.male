Though there are some disadvantages to decentralization, they are outweighted by advantages such as more knowledgable employees and technology improvements.   * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * According to the article by Paramjit s. Kahai, Houston H. Carr, and Charles A. Snyder, the trend concerning this issue is going towards decentralization. A recent study presented in the article shows that 46% of all participants would describe their Information System in the past as highly centralized. Only 27% still say that it is highly centralized in their current configuration, and prediction for the future result in only 16% highly centralized systems.  The article discusses the problems associated with this trend of decentralization, such as difficulties with maintenance of the IS. Despite the disadvantages, the article comes to the conclusion, that the trend will hold in the future, since employees computer skills will increase further requiring less centralization, along with the technological development, where PC get more and more powerful, and are able to perform processes, which in the past only where able by the centralized "Super Computer". Much more than that, todays business environment is changing faster than ever before, and with out decentralization, companies are just not as efficient in adapting to the changes at different places and times. The article however states, that some centralization will also be necessary in the future, to provide some of the advantages, such as easy adaptation of new software and some management control.
