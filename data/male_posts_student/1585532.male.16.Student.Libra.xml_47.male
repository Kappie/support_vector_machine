It's got great internet connection, but its horrible for anything else.  It has a 475 Mhz Celeron and built in Intel chipset.  Which equals crap.  Anyways, so far its been raining out here, which sucks alot.  Its wet and cold, and they have a jacuzzi I want to go into.  Boooooo.  Oh well, so far life on the road/in a different state is pretty boring.  Overall, I'm bored.  So I'm sitting on here typing and talking to other people.  Woo.  Okay, well...I'm taking random pictures among with other things.  Well...I'm bored so.....bye.
