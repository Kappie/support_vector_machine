I know an emotion that I have been feeling ever since I came to my uncles place is how much I miss my mom. He really takes care of me and it reminds me of how mom took care of me. It is funny that being in New York, the most profound thing I have noticed is that and not the thousands of new faces and new places that I have seen. I know I am lucky to have some people in my life that worry about me like that. I have a cousin in Michigan who makes me feel like family. He knows who he is. I don’t tell him often enough how much I appreciate his friendship, but I think we both have an understanding. Sunday the Radical Desi conference will begin, lasting a whole week. I am excited…
