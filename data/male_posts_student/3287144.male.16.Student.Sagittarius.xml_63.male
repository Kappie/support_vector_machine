Well to add anything more would be pointless as I will have access to my note book when I come to type up my full voyages on here but I will detail my reading so far;     1984- George Orwell  Gulliver's Travels - Jonathan Swift  Bones and Silence -Reginald Hill   All 3 are worthy of reading - The first being the best by far obviously but the other two have seen my through this holiday without a loss of sanity... anyway 3 minutes left and it took an awfully long time to publish last time so I will end this posting... here.
