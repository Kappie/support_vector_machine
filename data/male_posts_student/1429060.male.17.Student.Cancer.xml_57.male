I was paid an exorbitant tip for my duties, yet I am not overjoyed at that. I enjoyed the PSAT, but that seems to have no bearing. So here I am at the computer, typing pointless words for no goddamn good reason, staring at the screen, sneezing like hell (due to changing pressure systems), and feeling thoroughly depressed. I have no idea why I am typing this at the moment. It really has no purpose. Maybe it's the layers of work I have, or some deadline that is bearing over me. But it just occurs spontaneously, even in the best of conditions. Depression is the payment for thinking, it seems.  Ah, this is all shit. I am angsty. Forgive me for this post.
