There seems to be some things that I wanted to do before school starts, and now it's doubtful that much of any of it will happen. Here are a few key things that need to happen before Friday, @ 8:00AM.  1. Read "All Over But the Shoutin'" - Rick Bragg, why you as? Because I have a test over the entire book on the first day of school, shoot me now!  2. Get my mess of a room/inside of car cleaned up so I actually have a little room to work with. I'm sick of climbing over things to sit inmy chair at my computer.  3. School shopping maybe? My Mom hasn't mentioned a thing about it, and I wouldn't mind spending a little while shopping for some new stuff. But what day do I do that on?  4. Read 2 other books that I'll eventually be tested over.  5. Procrastinate about all of that, and enjoy the last few days of freedom a little more.  Can I get an Amen?
