That means I am moving soon. She starts work there on Aug. 12th - so I will have to take some time off and drive out to nor cal and get her all settled in.   Until I can find a job out there, I am going to have to hang tight back in the DFW. That's fine, I'm in no hurry. I want to get a decent paying job before I tackle the great unknown. Sad to say, I wasn't ready to move anything or anyone out to nor cal this soon. I just wasn't prepared as far as money goes. I was planning on a few more months of savings so I can make it smooth. Well - life doesn't EVER go as planned and damn if I hate that so much.  I had to give my 30 day notice today at the apartment complex. I am not going to be able to pay two rents - one here and in cali. Nick said I could stay at his house until I found another job, so that is cool. I am hoping not to be there for to long. There are TONS of networking positions all over the Bay area - I don't see a big turn down around there.   I am planning on flying out there mid-august to carry out some interviews. This is all happening so fast. I am almost overwhelmed. No big deal - just roll with the punches.  Tonight, I am going to the Houston area to spend some time with my grandparents. We are gonna go down to the beach and hang out - shoot some fireworks and have a good ol' time. hahaha. :)   current mood:  excited current music: karate
