They lasted through the day with the only hassle being adjustments every so often. Then, in a stupid OCD moment around dinnertime, I tried to adjust the side frame and....CRACK! That part snapped off. I tried superglue, but it would take the night to dry.       Woke up this morning half-blind and tried on the newly repaired pair of glasses. They sorta fit, but my mom and I figured we should just get a new pair. I took the day off from school, basically under neccessity, to get new frames.      So now I have a new pair of glasses and my first absence of the school year, on a day with two tests, nonetheless. Oh well, not like I could've gone to a packed, pushy school with crap vision. =/      Oh yeah, played a demo of Pikmin 2 at WalMart, and it kicks ass. Just what I need, more games I'll buy this fall... I NEED A JOB!!!! U_U
