Getting frustrated... can't seem to concentrate on the practical.. esp the programming. Was supposed to be late for the 1100 econs tutorial today, but when I reached there, there was a fire alarm, and so classes delayed till 1120. whew..  The OS lectures and practicals are so turgid..Thursday is a long day for me, all the way from 1100 to 2100. And by the time i reached home, it's around 10pm ++.    Got to buck up, luckily i have nice housemates whom i can get along and relate with.. Hmm, thinking of where to go this weekend... looks like i may have to stay at home to study ya. Alrighty, got to go.. really tired now. i think i have to update my journal more often.. see you!
