Call it some kind of fetish acitvity or whatever, but it didnt take long for me to rip open every hood and bonnet of my toy cars, and frisk out every minute part of the little assembly that they were made up of. Hell no! I was no budding engineer, and fortunately my parents quickly realized that there were no "creative" or "innovative" intentions and urges behind playing a bit of havoc with my toys; but "destructive" in the absolute sense of the word! Well, my friends would vouch that I still haven't changed! The so called destructive nature still remains one of the essential factors in my life, but then I have mellowed down quite a bit, and would probably break a few glasses and mugs in the kitchen (Excuse me dear Joshi brothers), not more than that, certainly not cars!   This fear of my childhood habits was constantly ringing in my mind, as I ventured out today, to get behind the steering wheel of a real car, the very first time in my life. I find it highly surprising myself, that I did not care to learn driving a four wheeler to this day, given the fact about my passion for cars, not exactly cars in general, but atleast considering an avid F1 Racing fan that I am. But honestly, I couldnt have got any lazier. If it had not been for my temporary instruction permit (that will expire soon in a month or so), I would have probably never thought of seriously learning driving, when that's one thing that probably sits somewhere between the top 3 list of "To-Do" acitivties for anybody who wants to get to the United States. I think I always wanted to drive a car, unlike those who prefer to be navigators and enjoy being driven around, and it seemed exciting watching others around me hopping into the driver's seat and driving long distances with consummate ease. Somehow, I was never hell-bent upon learning to drive (and driving to learn!). Driving will probably join the list of quite a few other things which seem to happen late with me...a pretty late start, but a start anyways. "Shubasya Shigram" as we call it in Aamcha Marathi.  Yes, its an immense relief, finally, to have broken my own shackles, and taken the first step towards driving a four wheeler. Hurrah! I not only managed to steer clear of destroying anything on the roads, I think I did a fairly decent job as a rookie driver. Well obviously I was taken to a neighborhood where I could not really get any chance of destroying anything in my path, as nothing came in my way and my driving, except for some wierd intermittent mental illusions of cars flying past me that I had on occasions (no, my sugars were perfectly normal)! Having said that, I am in no way tooting my own "horn" (Haha...pun very much intended...but you know what, I actually did bang the horn once, and the instructor next to me almost jumped in his seat!!). I suppose, I have quite a long way to go before I can master the steering wheel. I started off well, almost got over confident to be frank and messed with many of the driving basics. For a few minutes, I lost my composure, and I was all over the place. I tried to appear as if I was unflappable, but in vain. I kicked myself and gradually regained my lost balance.   I had BIG problems when it came to manoeuvring the turns, especially where you stop at STOP signs and make turns. I managed to get the 90 degree turns correct only once or twice (although not really "copy book" stuff). The most intriguing thing I practically found out was how people can manage to turn well and accelerate even better, both at the same times!!? Its like accelerating and turning in a fairly swift, steady yet calm motion, just as you apply butter to bread in one neat stroke (Wow, is that really a good way to compare..??..I doubt, but forgive my spontaineity once more). I flunked on this part of my driving. When I thought I managed to accelerate pretty well on sharp turns/curves, I either achieved an "understeer" or "oversteer" because of lack of good control on the steering (Yeah, Yeah - Wait till you hear more F1 "lingo" in my future blogs!). And then on occasions I managed to hit the kerbs extremely well ("smooth turns" that is), but then either went too hard on the pedal or so slow that my car barely crawled out of the turn. It was a Plymouth by the way, very nice car; old one, but seemed to tug along nicely. My top speed for the day was 35, when the limit was 25, and if not for my instructor calming me down continously, my sudden surge of adrenalin would have been responsible for not only some destruction, but also a ticket on the way home for me. I wish I had the chance to check my sugars during one of these "surges". I can bet my glucometer would have conked off!  As with many rookie drivers, I made the mistake of "fighting" the car, trying and pushing too hard at times, when all I needed to do was to be more laidbackish in my driving...do the simple things right. Its tough though, I don't think driving is that simple, as to manage to relax in your very first driving lessons; its like any other art, easy to understand theoretically, but try to put it into practice and you know how it becomes a different ball game altogether. I learnt one big lesson - more than "driving", its about controlling the vehicle. I would love to try a stick shift, but I can already see how much efforts I would have to put in to master the manual transmission, the late learner that I call myself. I am very much optimistic though, and the future does not look bad. Driving's addictive. I did not want to get out of the car even after an hour of toil under the opressive Colorado heat.  Overall, I was inconsistent but after an hour of twists and turns, I emerged out of the car alive and well and was pretty satisfied with my early lessons.  Just you wait till I buy a car for myself someday...I am gonna HIT the road or what!  I DO NOT BELIEVE all the Schumachers, Coulthards, and Montoyas driving at speeds of 300 kph with a killer g-force of upto 6 or 7g. These men are UNREAL, they are DOWNRIGHT CRAZY; they must be robots, I bet they cannot drive! It just seems humanely impossible to me. If I have the audacity to talk of under and over steering at 25 mph, care to spare a thought for these men, driving a 600 kilogram, 800 BHP and 3000 CC machine, that goes 0 to 60 in the blink of any eye (under 3 seconds); with  seemingly ridiculous ease?!
