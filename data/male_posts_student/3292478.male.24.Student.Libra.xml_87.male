Out there is opportunity, the world is my proverbial oyster and the time is now for me to make it big. Yee ha!  Bollocks to it all, I'm finally finishing University in a months time (hooray I hear them cry!) and so the time has come to get a job.  Not my usual part-time gubbins mind you. I've done my time in Poundland, the Shell Garage, the Onion Factory, Mastercare warehouses, building sites, Greenwoods Menswear et al.  No this time its to be a proper job, no more dossing around each day.   Playing snooker when I have 3000 words due in yesterday .  Never again .  Laying in, watching 6 hours of daytime TV pap when there are umpteen other essential jobs awaiting .  Ha Ha, a thing of the past I tell you .  So here goes, my valiant attempt to actually get a proper job and live an honourable existance. Updated each day in the faint hope that it may, somehow, aid in my eternal struggle against life as we know it.  What would Fred Elliot say... " I tell thee Ashley, I tell thee "
