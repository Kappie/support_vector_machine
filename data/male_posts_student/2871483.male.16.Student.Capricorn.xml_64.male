We're losing Mr. Siess and P.C. to middleschools, but the real kick in the head is we're LOSING THE GODDAMN FIELD SHOW!  I can't fucking believe it.  I was so psyched for it, so looking forward to it, and it get yanked from us.  That's not cool!  -  For everyone who's taking the AP test: STOP STUDYING SO HARD.  Seriously.  It is really unhealthy to study 22 hours a day, seriously.  -  As for teachers, I am THIS close to mashing Mr. Morris's head in with a garden spade, for chrissake!  He's such a goddamn jackass!  Cranny is becoming more and more intolerable each day, but still not enough to ruin History Class for me, heheh...  -  Did I mention O.C.D really fucking sucks?  -  I need to spend some serious time with my guitar and get my pentatonic scale down.  Yes, I do scales in my free time.  My friend's teacher called it "playin' the fish".  Cute at best.  -  I've been addicted to two shows I really shouldn't be, American Idol and The O.C.  However, once my hot chicks are all gone, I'll stop watching.  -  I'm really pissed off at the Mariners, they haven't started this bad in a long, long time.  More ranting on that later.
