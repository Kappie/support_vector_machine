I'm a treetop flyer   Well there's things I am  And there's things I am not  Yes I'm a smuggler and I could get shot  I ain't gonna die, I ain't going to get caught  You see I'm a flying fool, and this aeroplane is, woo, hot   I'm a treetop flyer  Born survivor  Workin' alone -- Stephen Stills - Trytop Flyer Thats my theme song for BF1942 :).
