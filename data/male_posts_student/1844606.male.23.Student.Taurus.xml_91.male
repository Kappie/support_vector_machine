It involved holding hands and being wrapped up tight in a blanket at Lake Michigan.   I'm getting MTV2 for free this week for some reason.  Novel concept of learning about new bands through video form.  I'm going to sleep so much this next week.  Buddy Holly ignored my presence for the second time in a row.  Is it so wrong to want to talk?  I fell in love with my story, wishing it was true.
