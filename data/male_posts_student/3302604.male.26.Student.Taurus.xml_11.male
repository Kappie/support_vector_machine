What with the weather getting better, Edinburgh has now become 'Tourist-tastic' and is full of people who appear to forget the simplest things like how to walk in a straight line as soon as they leave their own country. This irritates the hell out of the locals and so there is a lot more pushing and shoving accompanied by random swearing etc. etc.  Surely went you go abroad you expect to have to use the language of the country that you are going to? I mean how far do you think you would get going abroad with no idea what people were saying to you or what any of the signs mean? But here they are, seemingly confused, but only because they haven't a clue as to what's going on. Then they get upset when you don't understand what they are going on about and annoyed whan you try to talk to them  People eh?  Jack
