Some of them are quite weird...and you have been warned.  Underwriting = Pengunderaitan *  Proper Advice Practices = Amalan Nasihat Berpatutan Financial Risk = Risiko Kewangan Non-Financial Risk - Risiko Bukan Kewangan Annuity = Anuiti   *  I am still not sure about this translation and I do not think it is correct. Care to comment?
