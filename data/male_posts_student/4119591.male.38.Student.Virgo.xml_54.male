(I was going to say "hate" instead of "dislike," but the feeling I have just isn't that strong.) I mean, I understand why companies want to at least have a good guess at how many individual readers drop by (and view their ads) -- this is one of the ways in which they make money. Seems "reasonable." However, I have a very poor memory for which sites I've registered a log-in name; which address I used, which password I thought of and so I created a single alter-ego (complete with its own valid email address) to use for all of my registrations.   As far as they know, I'm a middle-aged housewife earning $45,000 annually (by selling orange peel lampshades on eBay) and my interests are skateboarding, knitting and Pong. Presumably this information is used to support advertising revenues and to select what kinds of ads I am likely to see when I visit any given web site with which I am registered. It's a good gig -- at least it is for me.   WIRED.com (no registration required, by the way) tells me that I am not  urlLink alone . Lots of people do this -- certainly not the majority, but likely enough to throw off the official count when ad rates and demographic stats are concerned. My comrades and me are likely going to cause the next economic depression... sorry about that.   Signed, Amanda Hugandkiss, Hoople, AK.
