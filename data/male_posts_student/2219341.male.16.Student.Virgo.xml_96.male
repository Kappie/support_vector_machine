I will be...strong on my own...I will see through the rain...I will find my way...I will keep on...traveling this road...till I finally reach my dream...till I'm living and I'm breathing...my destiny...  it comforts me...it keeps me...alive each day of my life...always guiding me...providing me...with the hope I desperately need.....well I gotta believe...there's something out there meant for me...I get on my knees...praying I will receive...the courage to grow and the faith to know.......  that I will be...strong on my own...I will see through the rain...I will find my way...I will keep on...traveling this road...till I finally reach my dream...till I'm living and I'm breathing...my destiny...
