I'll leave much elaboration aside, and let the pictures communicate the truth. Christopher and I did a few leisurely laps of the lake, once in the mid-day heat, when we had a little squirt tentatively nibble at our lure, the under length pike stole away when he discovered that novice fishermen from England give slack enough to make a get away. We returned empty handed.   urlLink     Christopher had a rough idea where the 'McDaddy' of the lake would be at, having caught an enormous beast of 79cm the previous day. Apparently they all hang out at the same bars. We rode gently along, basking in the sun, inching our way forward; bang, the line went tight, Christopher adopted the frog stance to give himself a fighting chance. We saw it jumping out of the lake, some 50 meters from the boat, livened up by the sting of the lure. Reeled it in, snatched it into the boat, and took the knife to its spine. I was pretty made up. It was my first time in a boat during Pike wrestling.        Self sufficient living as encouraged by the sixties generation of flower sniffers arrived in style this weekend. On Saturday we had new potatoes from Dad's plot, accompanied with pike from the lake caught by Christopher. It was my best meal of the year. Fully organic, eaten on nature's doorstep, with a knob of shop bought butter. What an experience.     Painted toe nails may look fancy when you have your new flip-flops, the summer winds dislodging sock fluff from in between the digits. Red Red Toes are lovely on the Spanish sands. But beware, the insatiable appetite of the predator pike, combined with its poor eye sight, makes your painted nails an attractive snack. Good looks under water is like dancing in front of the mirror. Wasted.     We used a red bin for the excess bits and off-cuts, we lost about a 3rd of the fish. The head in itself weighed about a kilo. Captain Birds Eye uses the contents of the off-cut bucket for his choicest crispy fish fingers. It is good to know what enters your mouth, and where it came from. I'll let you in on a little secret.      Fish Fingers.
