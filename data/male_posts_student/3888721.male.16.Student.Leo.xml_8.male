I was so pissed and groggy, then went downstairs to eat breakfast, then like still in a blur state. Then came back home, went on the net and did abit of my homework. Tried to study geography but little progress was made. So went to tuition afterwards, then decided with jason that we gonna act blur and just forget about our chinese tuition. So ya...now i am watching the NKF show. As i hav said before, its the only show that can make me drop a tear. I figured maybe because its touching and everyone's crying, so will bu zhi bu jue cry also. The most wasted part is Fei yu qing not able to come and perform...sian halfway. Anyway...hope this week is gonna be a better week, with so many bad things happening to the class last week. oh ya oh ya...and i want wish my hia di, chee lim, a god damn bloody happy birthday. hahaa...fell aslp talking to me darrel darren, the 3 Ds. Are we that boring? hahaha...I don think can hit 1million this time, no big shot to persuade ppl call. Look at 5566, those 5 monkeys can just come out and sing then raised 200000 calls, so ridiculous man. lee guo huang, my idol just came out and sing the modified verion of ba qian huan gei wo ba. After singing, the no. of calls jump drastically, still jumping lor. They did a good job editing the song. Well, its all for charity man... lets be more generous. another 20 plus days, and it will be the last national day rally of our PM Goh. A much anticipated speech, but i rather its not his last...but well, we hav to move on. weekends are unproductive, i rather there's no saturday or sunday, so i would be more motivated to study. Ok.. hope tomolo will be a better day.
