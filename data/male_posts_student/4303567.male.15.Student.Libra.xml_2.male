I'm telling this to you because here in Puerto Rico we are celebrating all of our basketball team victories over at the Olympics 2004 in Athens. Pride is something inside everyone, but it is their descision whether to show it or not. Here in Puerto Rico we are known for our ways of being loud, but we are even louder when it comes to sports. I think if you want to find one of the worlds biggest fans, you should come to our island. We leave everything aside just for our sports. No matter what you have to do, if the game is "on", you have to stop what you are doing. Even in school students are like that; especialy now that we are playing at the olimpics. In every single classroom you will see at least one or two student with a portable tv or radio keeping informed the rest of the room with scores and time. You may also see this if we are in study break or lunch. Everybody is in the library watching the game on tv, even the teachers are watching. If you are asking yourself why are we puertoricans like this, well at least for me it is very simple. We celebrate cuz' we are showing the world all that we are capable of doing, because the mayority of the world has a very bad idea of what Puerto Rico is and of what we can do. So everytime your country is being represented by any kind of team support them with out worring what others may think of you, because no one can ever take that feeling for your home land away.
