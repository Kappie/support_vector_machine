I didnt know i liked hockey that much because i was literally going to cry for some strange reason. Its kinda weird b/c i cant cry during "The Passion" but i was about to cry when i saw the Sharks get shut out. I thought that was kinda weird and strange on my part. After that sad moment i went to the Dublin track and ran a mile for a boy scout Merit badge. I cant believe that i was really slow b/c my time was 9:14 and last year it was 7:54. Of course last year after i was done I fell on the ground and couldnt get up for like 5 minutes. Then i came home and thats where i am right now just sitting down and watching Full House. I have CM next week and im really nervious so please pray for me. Thanks.................bye
