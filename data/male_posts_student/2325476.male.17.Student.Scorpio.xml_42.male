If you were special enough to come here, then you know that I'll be posting, but don't tell anyone else. make them come here of their own accord. thanks, you rock.  So, earlier I decided that there's nothing for me here in charlotte. A little later me di cuenta(i realized) that that wasn't exactly true. I'm meeting a guy that writes music for movies and has his own studio and can help me out with that stuff on tuesday, and I'm prolly gonna be getting a personal trainer for kicking who is John Kasay's personal trainer. So I am getting some neat opportunities here.    -- BUT --   I can't really say I'm that happy here. I've all but lost all contact I ever had with any of my Virginia friends, with the possible exception of Sujay. Those were the people I identified with more than anyone else in my life. Sure, I have friends here, and bear in mind for this that they are great, excellent people, and I mean them no slight, and my life would be total and utter shit without them, but I feel like I need to be elsewhere, doing different things. I can't be happy in this city, at this school. There is nothing about the girls here that would make me interested in a relationship, therre's maybe 3-4 guys I enjoy hanging out with, and I dunno how many of them I'd call real friends, and about the only things I can do for fun are play my guitar and program on my computer. I have a lot of love and compassion to give, I just don't have anyone to give it to... I feel like I need to go somewhere, make a fresh start, like I did in VA. That's why I can't wait to move to CA. It's so far from here physically, mentally, and socially, that I just feel like I would be in my element out there.  Of course I could just be in a mood of self-pity...
