Somehow felt tired at around 1.30 pm, caught a wink till 4 whenI woke up and bathed.   Looking back at this month, didnt have much time to rest other than today, I guess its a good thing. Feels so tired lately I couldnt do much of a thing. Didnt study much today, just slacked my day through. Boring.   Just wonder if tomorrow's after-school event would see me playing WMMT at Tampines, or ID at Atrium. I feel like shifting a H shifter so badly. And my time of 4'43 obviously doesnt show I'm that seasoned in this game.   Founder's day tomorrow, let off at around 10 am if everything goes well.. I'm lostin my mindagain. Now my heads feels empty, cant churn out any more words to fill in. Guess that concludes my day.   Thot for the day-"You must be at peace with your mind, then you can form what you really wanna say." - Aaron.  Funny why this entry sounded so emotion-less. Nite.
