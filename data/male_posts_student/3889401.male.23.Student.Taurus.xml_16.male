After complimenting for his own wonderful blog, this is not the least expected encouragement from a booboisie like him, but yet I asked why. He was very honest with me telling me that, my lil picture depicting some Afro-american guy is the reason. Yeah, may be. So true he was.   But this pic has a lot of stories, memories, tears ( !!!!) , whichbind me with my Btech advisor Dr.Amalendu Mukherjee. The pic has been edited to show only me of course.Dr. Amalendu Mukherjee is one of those rarest of professors, whose company I enjoyed most. He would tell me stories about his son, when I asked him about the Nonlinear Dynamics class, he was taking. When I asked if entropy increase should be taken into account in the chemical reaction modeling problem for information storage, he galdly recited me some Urdu couplet, whose meaning only Khayyam can tell. When I asked him about writing my thesis, he talked about blackholes and distant galaxies. When I meet him in Park and looked into his misty red eyes, he took his eyes off me. When I asked for recommendation for my graduate studies in USA, he talked about the French delegation who were coming to Mechanical Engineering Department for learning Casting and Welding from Dr.Kajal Biswas. This is the happy part of the story.   The sad part began, when I got no scholarship to attend a gradschool in US; when I got a B in project eval. When I went to say good bye to him and he asked me for working as PhD in Mech Engg Dept. After such poor performance, when he had given me B for project evaluation, it was very kind of him to ask me to continue my studies under him. I am really grateful, but I am not shameless enough to continue my study in IIT Kharagpur, where I have been such a loser and that to under esteem patronage of him.In the mean time, I was hearing from some of my batchmates, "  Brother-in-Law, what happened  ?". But, in between those happy and sad stories, there were tears. I cried for something, I cried for someone like a kid showing all tantrums and I got the biggest prize of my life.
