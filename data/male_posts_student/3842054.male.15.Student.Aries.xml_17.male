Ex: Going surfing with Erin. WEll, this morning i woke up, excited to go driving to the Wellington Mall to meet Brittney and Becca. But, of course, my dad took the van to work, and i cant drive the focus because its a stick shift, which i cant drive. So, I get driven to the mall, and I meet those pesky girls, and they make me go to all their feminine beauty stores. And I drag them into AE and Hollister... yeah. It was just your basic trip to the mall. WE went to most of the stores, and if you want to check it out that badly, go to www.wellingtonmall.com .   At the mall, I bought the Julianas Theory Cd, Love, (the title is a line from their song Repeating, Repeating. ) I also finally got the Dashboard Confessional CD from Brittney while i gave her sugarcult and switchfoot. I also got brown, cordoroy, shorts from Hollister.  So then i came home and played Crash Bandicoot, becasue Im old school. And hten i went to katies house for a few hours helping babysit, and then, yeah. I came home and tried to listen to all this music. Then I played Spiderman, and now, I'm typing. SO I DID SOMETHING TODAY!!! WOO. And tommorow, Im going to earn some money doing chores. And hten im going to go to the Marlins game, which i dont want to because i hate watching them struggle. yeah, and then on sunday, im not going to Brittneys little play by the beach thing. but ill find something to do. Ok, im tired, and i just want to sit, talk to becca dan and britt, and listen to music. Woo.  ~ i can tell as you turn, i smell the sulfur so clear and fire's a beautiful sound and the wings that you burn turn to ashes my dear and ashes just fall to the ground yeah we're only ashes ~  GREAT SONG BY SoCo. Probably my favorite. Check it out and go by North, if you dont already have it.
