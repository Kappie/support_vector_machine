It'll be the biggest thing since the summer of 1969, since the Martha Steuart scandals, since the making of furbys... yes bigger than furbys. Not even the whole band knows about it, only one outsider... Well see what happens. Anyways, it's finally the weekend and it's awesome. I wasted most of my Saturday away though... Last night was the 88.1 Show at the summit. I think it was one of the best shows I've ever been to!   Basically what's going on with me is this. Things are getting better... I was about to get into big trouble because my biology teacher, Mrs. Caldwell, was gonig to call and tell on me cause whenever she asks me to come in for lunch I never do. That's school. I like this girl.   Well I had fun updating my blog for the first time in a week. Woah.  peace
