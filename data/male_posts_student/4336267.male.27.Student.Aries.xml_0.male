It even looks a bit like a fly, although it will have four wings instead of two and one glassy eye instead of two beady ones. Uncle Sam, who is bankrolling the project to the tune of $2.5 million and wants to see robofly airborne by 2004   why are fly robots creating such a buzz? Flies, for all their faults, are outstanding pilots. They can take off and land in any direction, even upside down. They can change course in just 30-thousandths of a second. And they process information at speeds that make a supercomputer look like an abacus.   Specifications Robofly will weigh about 43 milligrams -- roughly the weight of a fat housefly. Its body will be made of paper-thin stainless steel and its wings of Mylar, which looks and feels a lot like Saran Wrap. Robofly will be powered by the sun, and a tiny device called a piezoelectric actuator will flap its four puny wings 180 times a second.   How does it fly?  urlLink Dickinson  discovered that insects use three different wing motions that, taken together, create backspin and air vortices that create lift. The complexity of the movement means robofly will need four wings to do what flies do with two.   Present work Controlling the robofly once its airborne.   Future California Institute of Technology in Pasadena who are developing tiny gyroscopes just one millimeter in diameter. Caltech researcher  urlLink Kris Pister  is developing for "smart dust" which will pack sensors, communicators and computing power onto tiny silicon motes   To learn more go here  urlLink http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~flymanmd/
