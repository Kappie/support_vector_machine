One of the discernible dialogues will include a classmate feeling Spencer's muscle, as he talks about a story from the gym earlier that day...  Later, there will be an interaction between the new guy and Spencer, one of the regulars on the show.  The sort of dialogue where the regular says "Listen, maybe you don't understand how it works around here..." in an angry tone.  Will also at some point say "'round here we work hard, and we play hard..."
