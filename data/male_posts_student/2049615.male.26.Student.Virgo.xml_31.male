He was clearly in the wrong;  he had a stop sign which he failed to heed, unlike the person making the left turn who was at the stop sign as I entered the intersection.  He came on me fast enough for me to stare into his glassy eyes, which were set into a doughy face framed by stringy blond hair. Jumping out of his way, I gave him the finger and told him to "watch where the fuck [he's] going!"  Simple shit.  I like to think that when people who run stop signs and only narrowly avoid committing murder wind up only getting the finger they would be relieved an accept some well-deserved chastisement.  Of course, that's because I'm pretty fucking na•ve.  No, as I continued home the guy came up behind me, having circled through a few blocks trying to find me, slowed down, and yelled "FAGGOT!"  I am fucking sick of being called a faggot.  In the seven years I lived in Madison, I was never called a faggot.  Here in  urlLink Bumblefuck, Indiana  on the other hand it happens about once every three weeks.  And while there's not a "pattern" per se, there are a few features which distinguish etiquette here in the great state of Indiana.  Only call a person a faggot if a) you outnumber them by at least five to one, and are on foot after nightfall;  or b) you are in a car and are able to speed away scot-free.  Who is a faggot?  A person is a faggot who is not clearly a member of a fraternity, or who you simply decide that you do not like.  It is my opinion that here in Bloomington, a city which I hate more with every passing minute, this sort of behavior is promoted by two factors:  First, in Indiana the average license plate has around nine characters, and is only displayed in the back.  These license plates are nearly illegible under the best of circumstances.  Second, Indiana gays are insufficiently armed.
