Allow me to explain: I die slowly in the school environment. That is all that is to it.  My English teacher hates my essays; she wants to kill them, and I don't think she approves of my liberal Unitarian poetic ass. Inversely, my pre-Calculus teacher seems to really appreciate my grades; she is very conversational with me. And AP Biology is fun. Today we played with sulfuric acid and my skin is stained with potassium permanganese! Fun!  I am soon to be off to watch Mademoiselle Elise audition at MUS. Happiness, I daresay.  Here is a piece I wrote a time ago, trying to break from the stream of conscious thought style I had adopted. I have been reluctant to post it due to references, but I was convinced in any case.   Hallway  My circle of hands I’ve been noticing of late that Toes have been tripping into a little group This little group Where everyone can sing and dance And I can’t But I can poetize and my fingers Dance like their feet across the ivory I’ve fallen out, from a cloud Where my own sun set Daily Don’t get me wrong, I am not an angel And I like the rain when it falls The rain took me with it, down to The earth’s surface Splashed The sisters, like goddesses, giggle Smile and one is always holding her Mechanical hand – she has three hands – She knows my computer, healed it Lana-lana-bo-bana The other had something in her Burst Random letter, random line She couldn’t listen to the music Music – noise with a wavelength Curly hair A small smile and nails strum the Strings of a guitar She’ll make a moon disc soon Give it to the Greek boy Greek beauty Poised like a mercury Singing in that fantastic voice of his I want to be his mind It can run faster than his hand paints Paints pictures Like a photograph – click That she takes in a grassy field Run To see her after class Look in bespectacled eyes Such a lovely occurrence to say Good afternoon But I can’t, not to that other girl I say good morning She is panicking over the history Poet singer in a play I drive early to sit in her car Breathe her exhalation And I want to hold her hands Duck-yellow watercolor tips Kiss her cheek Spin her around and Tear The skin off her shoulder blades To get far enough inside –  Feel the heart? –  And watch As fledgling angel wings unfold.    Have a nice day. :-) Even though with White Station (which failed the fucking government education testing) I can never have a nice day.
