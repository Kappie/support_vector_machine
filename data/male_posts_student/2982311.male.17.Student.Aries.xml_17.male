The first thing on this list, something that meant very much to me, was to see an old friend one last time, to tell her that i had always thought of her and that she meant very, very much to me...and to say one final good-bye.  now that i have seen her again, now that i have spoken with her and spent time with her, i find that i simply cannot bring myself to say good-bye to her. i hadn't realized just how much she had meant to me until she was lost, i didn't realize how much i had missed her until i found her again.  for some reason, i wasn't able to tell her how much she meant and how i had always thought of her all these years. i don't know why but i just don't say it.    i know that this item on my list will Never be completed, because it is just not possible for me to ever say good-bye to her for good, she means far too much to me for that.  it's been so long since we were close, but i find that the one thing that i desire most is to be as close to her as i once was so long ago. It's such a foolish thing to want, isn't it? i know that i can never mean as much to her as i once did, she has other people to take the place where i once stood inside her heart.  what i find truly sad is that after all these years i could find not a single person who could fill the void that she left within my own heart. There's just no replacing her, she is...special to me.  even after all of these long years, my feelings for her are very strong. i would say more, i truly wish that i could say more, but...i do not think that that would be a wise or prudent thing to do. She has already chosen her path, i have no right what so ever to even think about interfering. All i can do is hope and pray that the path she has chosen will be the right one for her.   in truth i do wish for her to change her path, but as i said it is her decision and hers alone.  i would tell her all these things, but i am afraid that it would distance us, and i want to be closer to her, not more distant.  i guess what i really, truly want is...  to be closer to her than just an old friend.  i pray that if she ever reads this she will understand how i feel, i would tell her in person but i am just too much of a coward.  i must ask, can you ever forgive me?  can you forgive me for letting us drift apart as we did?  can you forgive me for not finding you sooner?  and can you forgive me for felling the way that i do now?  can you forgive me for not telling you?  and would you be able to forgive me for telling you, if i ever do so?  I know that i am unable to forgive myself for all of these things, and i want to tell you that...you are and always have been very, very dear to me.  old friend, won't you please forgive this silly love-sick fool?
