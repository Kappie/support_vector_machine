I'm always choosing not to go to it just because I'm never in the mood to learn about wireless technology. For some reason computer and technology stuff in general doesn't get me as excited as it used to. I'm not really concerned about not taking any computer classes next year because I'm really glad with my decision to switch over to lots of business classes. I guess as one gets older and learns more about one's self, he starts to embrace those things he previously wanted to reject. Hmm... that sounded a lot better in my head, haha.        Anyway, I watched the DNC Convention last night, and surprisingly, I was really excited about it. I'm normally not too worked up about politics or anything because my opinion doesn't really matter since I'm not old enough to vote yet. I don't know what came over me. I guess it was just the thought of all the big names that were going to speak last night (Al Gore, Jimmy Carter, and Bill Clinton) that made me so enthusiastic. I don't know if I'll be that way about the GOP Convention in August. Probably not, but it'll depend on who the speakers are. I'd definitely get into it if John McCain and Colin Powell started laying down the language, haha. But they probably won't...        Anyway, I thought all of the speeches were really great. I didn't like Jimmy Carter's speech as much as I thought I would, but then again, he really attacked President Bush like head on for all the mistakes he's made with the war. I didn't expect that from him, and Al Gore was pretty reserved even though he did go off a few times to lament the 2000 election and piss all over the Bush Administration for all their screw-ups. But Bill Clinton's speech was really just amazing. I was totally blown away. He's gotta be the best public speaker all of modern-day politics has to offer. I can't think of anyone, in either party, who can get a crowd going the way Bill Clinton can... it was really amazing to watch.        Well, that's my wrap up of the first day of the Convention. I don't think the next three days will be that good. I am looking forward to Ted Kennedy night tonight. But beyond that I'm really not all that interestedin what John Edwards and John Kerry have to say. Bill Clinton's already sold pretty much the entire democratic party on them. There's not a whole lot left that needs to be said, haha.        Well sitting here in Mrs. Baessler's room, amongst her many books has me in a very literary mood. Maybe I'll give one of them a quick read until James and Mike get back from their lecture.
