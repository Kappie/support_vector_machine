Our political system is totally fucked, even more so than the system in the States. I think it's rather stupid how someone, a.k.a. Paul Martin, can be sworn in as Primeminister without an election, but rather, just because he is affiliated with the party in power. I can understand if he was placed there because the elected Primeminister died or got sick...But Jean Cretien was all but forced to resign by his own party. If a party is going to mutiny it's leader, I would imagine it is time for another election. That is the great thing about Canada's political system, we can have elections any old time the government wants within four years, as opposed to exactly every four years in the States.   Meh. I'm gonna stop ranting now. Paul should not be Primeminister. Period.   While we're on the topic, ABOLISH THE SENATE  and  DECLARE INDEPENDANCE FROM THE MONARCH.
