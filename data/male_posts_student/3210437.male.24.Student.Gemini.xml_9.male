We are currently trying to buy a home, and we have had two houses sold out from under us.  We have a bid in on a third house now and hope to hear back about it sometime tomorrow.  Pray that this one works out!  On top of the house buying, I have also been working overtime at work and teaching and preaching at church.  With all of this put together, I have had NO time, and I am not even going to mention how dirty our home is since we haven't had time to clean, mow, etc!!  Anyway, I'm going to try to get back to writing regularly as things hopefully slow up a bit.  I am also adding a link today that I was referred to by Dave Cargal, a guy from my church and work.  It is a pretty cool site, I have spent a bit of time reading on it today myself.  I hope you find it enjoyable.  It is an online journal called  urlLink Whosoever .  Well, gotta get back to the grind. *Final subliminal message* GO SEE FAHRENHEIT 9/11
