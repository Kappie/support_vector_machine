Not due for another week, but meh.  Today I was sick but still went to school.  When I got home, I realized that I forgot my key.  I was locked out for 4 hours with Fat'll and Pilitje.  So I finished my Biology homework and shot some hoops.  Dad brought me some really nice steaks and shrimp.  We were just watching Band of Brothers on the WW2 channel.  I mean, History Channel.
