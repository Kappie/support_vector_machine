Some people I know believe that they are perpetually perfect, they believe that I am an imperfect being.  Yes, I know I am...  I, at least, have the fucking decency to know what I am, not hide in an idiotic mask which makes people think that I am what I am not.  Morons.  Do you honestly believe you are great, I laugh at how cowardly you all to face your own truths.  What sad dumbfucks some of you are.  To think I honestly looked up to some of you...  I am disgusted at myself for believing, God damn it...  Why the hell did I believe it?  That was just sick.  I used to imagine that you guys were a perfect, well-bonded group, well, now is the time to face the facts, you aren't...  Hahahah!  My goodness, you treat other people to think that you are perfect but watch out, when they get a look at you behind the public eyes...  You aren't.  How sad that you aren't really what you are supposed to be...  Fuckers...
