No, he's not dying or anything...he's moving...across the country. He keeps saying he wants to come back in 6 months, but he might end up staying for an entire year. I don't know, what if he likes it, and stays forever!! Omg well I don't even want to go that far. We walken up to Ashley's house, where we recently had David's "Going Away" party. We snuck around the side of the house, Dave opened the back sliding door and ran into her eating on the coffee table. All I heard was footsteps and a loud scream. I was hiding down stairs, outside and was worried because after that I heard nothing. I thought maybe her or someone else had actually hurt Dave! We where only there for a little bit, but then her dad came home so we had to leave. We walked down to the Park and Dave had the brilliant idea of walking through the park to get behind my house. We both got stung by yellow jackets haha. After that we went to Nanaimo. I drove, after a huge fight with my dad about it because he always wants to drive...but he drove around Nanaimo, and back--even though Me and Dave left before my dad and brother went to go do their business. Yeah, actually my dad needed to go to the Superstore to return his steaks because they where infected haha. He actually called poison control last night omg! They where actually recalling them when he went in he said. Me and Dave stayed at the mall, and we went and ate New York Fries. Basicly for those who dont know, are the greasyiest, tastiest fries ever, covered in cheese sauce. My debit card was declind the first time cause I forgot my password! luckly, my second attempt worked. I didn't look to great today, because I didn't wash my cloths last night. But tommorow or wednesday I need to go out and hand out more resumes. After that we hung out in front of Wal-Mart mwahaha. My dad finally came to pick us up and he gave us a dollar each, so we had to go into walmart to get change...of coarse they dont sell cans up front, they also can't open the register unless a sale is made. So anyway, the teller told us we could go to customer service and get change. No, but she asked "Who said that??" i pointed to the teller, "TELLER 8?!", i said uhh yeah... she said "Thats completely against policy!!" then dave finally came to Teller 8's rescue and said "nonono, she said if we rush over maybe she would let us or something"... I never founded out what happened to Teller 8. Oh, and i wanted to add something else that I just was reminded of, when I was sitting in front of Wal-Mart today, across the street at a chrysler dealer guess what the temperature there was? 108 degrees. I dont exactly "feel" the heat as much as i used to..but it makes me sweat, which is nasty. It's about 85 in front of my house, but it was darn hot in that fucking parking lot!!
