Haha, so far so gd, I hope I can continue focusing for the rest of the year.  P.E was next. I didn't wear my pe shirt and shorts cuz I had a headache when I woke up today, so I decided not to take P.E. Mr Lim said tt for this whole term, we are allow to play any games tt we want. So I guess tt I'll be slacking everi P.E lesson frm now onwards. Well I dun think I wanna play soccer anymore, kindda lost confidence and interest in it already. If some1 motivates me to start again, den perharps I might.  The rest of the day was pretty slack. I did pay attention in everi lesson today except chinese, so tt's pretty gd for me already. Wow! After school, I went to Hongyue and Malbindar to Ginza to haf lunch at Sakura. In the restaurant, I learnt some realli interesting and at tt the same time sad stuffs, but I'm not gonna disclose anything here. If u wanna noe, cum ask me personally. Anyway, the bill was like $30.20.  The English workshop was alrite, but I was realli exhausted. I tried my best to keep focus and pay attention for juz one and a half hrs. Well, I hope tt this workshop will improve my English and allow me to get an A for the 'O' Lvls. Yea, guess tt's bout' it, I'm juz too tired to carry on. I still hafta save energy to watch The Bachelor later on. Alrite den. Ciao and Cya yall. =]
