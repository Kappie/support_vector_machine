I went to "Blues Fest 04" that was taking place in Portland today and just being around good and fun people was enough. It was was my first time that I was flirted with (by a guy;) His smile was the cutest feature. Then, soon after that, I was walking the other way now and I caught this shirt-less, muscle man wearing a cowboy hat and an hot tan! Ugh, I love being in a big city!! Ya don't get this in Bay City! People that are gay in Michigan are either flamers or just plain ugly (well, the ones in my city). I gotta hand it to Michigan though, there are some hot mo-fo-ers here (Like my guy:) ...OH, and I was standing in the crowds minding my own buisness and all the sudden I get beer spilt on my leg! I look down and all I see is this older dude lying on the ground. Then I look back and notice that the older dude fell because these two chicks tripped and fell over the damn guy! I look down at the girls to make sure they're all right and they were laughing then turned and started macking right there!! It's just that it was done so... randomly! I couldn't belive this all happened in like seconds! sheesh! It was fun, then I actually had a cute guy walk up to me and started talking to me but my dad was right there! The one time that he is (ofcourse) Ugh! Anyways, I'm out! Later Bro!... and you too.
