Check this out! http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0046/0046_01.asp contains "Christian" comics against Role-playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons (and like Slayer of Goodness, too!).    During the HOT years of Role-playing games (the 70s baby!) there were two significant deaths -- suicides -- that were both blamed to role-playing, specifically Dungeons  Dragons.  On August 1979, James Dallas Egbert III of Michigan State University left a kind of suicide note which contained misinterpreted messages that lead to investigators' beliefs of him telling them that D was what forces him to do so.  Big deal.  But what was more disturbing is the suicide of Irving "Bink" Pulling, June 1982.  His mother, Patricia, started BADD (Bothered About Dungeons and Dragons) and actively tried to incorporate D with crimes and suicides, even though courts dismissed her groups' claims.  This is REAL bias.  The most difficult part was, even though there are a great number of D players and makers that can attest that the game is, well, let's just call it "God-friendly" for laughs, the market of RPGs took a toll, and shops started pulling them out in reaction to wuss mothers who were so short sighted.  Okay, that was a biased info.  Anyway, that's what happened in America, and that's probably why the Philippines doesn't get that many players of D or RPGs for that matter.  At least, not those fantasy table-top types.  The best info here are from http://ptgptb.org/0004/hist4.html so check it out!
