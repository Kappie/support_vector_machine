Homework tells you to do it, but I just can't get down to doing the bloody thing. God!  I will not sleep!  I read Wei Xin's blog. He's a good writer. Good vocabulary with furious expansion of wit. Wonderful. Emotional. I read an article about me. It was when we fought. It wasn't nice. I felt hurt and pissed at hollow accusations and interpretations of my life. I don't hold it against him though I really hope he clears things up with his readers. It's defamation liable for legal prosecution. Hell, I'm liable coz I threatened to clout him a stiff one. Everyone makes mistakes. OOo.. I found another one. Boy! haha... This is bugging me though I don't know why.  I want to ask a question. Why do we say please? It's not a necessary part of our vocabulary. A sentence would function perfectly without it. The answer people have given me to this question is "because it's polite". Sure, but why do we need to say please to be polite? "Please" is not an emotion like "sorry" or "thank you". Sorry or thank you are expressed as a genuine emotional response. Please on the other hand is a tool, which is used to get what one wants. It's a game. How many times have we been asked, or have we heard someone being asked, "what's the magic word?" to which a quick or angsty "please" is produced?. We say please when we want something. I discussed this with Leon, who got well... flustered. Many replies, but none answered my question. "Because it is. That’s the way we're brought up. That's the way people have been brought up for a long time. Because it's polite."  "Please" is like playing politics. Do what is necessary to achieve the desired outcome. Why can there not be a mutual understanding by humans to accept and comply without first imposing unnecessary regulatory hindrances like "please". Bloody five-letter-word. Do I really have to ask you with a "please". What do you gain or lose from it's presence or absence respectively, in a string or words? Nothing. Self-satisfaction in some cases where the one who utters the word is seen to acknowledge his subordinacy. Cheap thrill if you ask me. Why is it polite to say "please". Who dictated this mandate? It is because it is? Like God?  Can I have a lollypop vs Can I please have a lollypop. Yes? Latter sounds nice? Sure. Why? BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY WE'VE BEEN TRAINED. But why have we been trained this way? Why has nobody asked this question before? Or why has nobody given due attention to a child who asks the same question. "Mummy, why do we need to say please?" Green doesn't have to have a reason to be called green. It could be called "yomama" for all I care.  I have an answer. Leon is a genius. I can't remember how he gave it to me, but I took it an expounded on the notion. Patience. Patience is the answer to why we say please. I'll bet that right now, you're positive I've flipped. First I ask unnecessary questions. (highly oo-liao). Then I have a ridiculous answer to a ridiculous question. Trust me, it works somehow. I have to prove it to myself too coz it's far fetched but I have to have an answer to this burning question. It's one of those things that needs closure no matter what. OK.  Patience is the answer to why we say please because... um.. because.. Ok, patience in undeniably a vital aspect of our being right? People with patience deficiencies have tough lives. People need to take a chill pill once in a while. So lets talk in terms of lollypops. The lollypop man is used to having kids ask him "politely" for lollypops with 20 cents in hand right? He does his job. Now, Tim comes along and says "can I have a lollypop". The lollypop man's not happy coz Tim wasn't polite, but he doesn't kick Tim's butt coz he exercises patience. Now, he wouldn’t have to exercise patience if the other kids didn’t say "please" and please wasn't normalcy. Coz then, everyone'd just go "Yo man, gimme a stick wit a cherry head so i can pop it in my mouth to lick and suck. I enjoy it". (YES! WE ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT LOLLYPOPS). And the lollypop man would be perfectly obliged to concur. So you see, no "please" no need to exercise patience. Sure, there are other ways to exercise patience but the key word here is exercise. That is; practice. Like math. Need practice to get good at it. I've convinced myself coz I want to. And I think I've done a reasonable job or trying to convince you too. umm...  I'm going to sleep now. It's 430 in the morning. I have to finish my essays. Have to finish essays... have to .. finish..................................................
