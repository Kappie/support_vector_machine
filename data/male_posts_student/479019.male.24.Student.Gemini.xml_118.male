In other news of me getting out and about, Linda invited me to go to a bar on Friday night. That was a truly tempting offer, but with work Saturday morning and the fact I'll be going to the SD County fair with girls from Cambridge right after that... I don't wanna run myself into the ground. The fair should be fun, as hanging out with them usually is. Too bad it's not on a later date, because there's a date which features the Honky Tonk Man, Konnan, and Evan Karagias. Hah... Konnan. I was actually a fan of him. Brandon used to joke about how funny it would be to see Konnan and El Cholo (from a local lucha libre federation) wrestle.  ***
