I've learnt quicksort, so I put my concentration my mergesort. Mergesort isn't very difficult, and the critical step is the merging procedure. I've used plenty of time to write the merge function. Although the program listing of mergesort is longer than that of quicksort, mergesort is easier to understand and more intuitive.  I've read my friend, puzzu's blog before writing this post. He wrote his blog well, whichshares his daily life and feelings. I thinkthis style is the best stylefor a teenager's blog.   Well, you may think that my blog is very boring, in fact it is. Since the writer of this blog is a boring person, too. I'll try to write less boring posts with all my effort.
