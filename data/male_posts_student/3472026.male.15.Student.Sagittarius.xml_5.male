The world title is given to people who the company believes can "carry the ball" and lead the company to new heights. With Layfield holding the title, the company will reach new lows. Remember a couple weeks back when I said that Layfield did a Nazi salute in the middle of the ring? Well, apparently WWE was supposed to punish him for his actions. I guess a world title run is a punishment for a wrestler who did a Nazi salute in Germany, and attempted to rape various younger talent backstage.  Knowing WWE's booking skills however, Layfield will be a  FIVE TIME! FIVE TIME! FIVE TIME! FIVE TIME! FIVE TIME WORLD CHAMPION!  Oh well, my opinion does'nt matter since I am just a "Geek who uses the internet".    Song of the Moment:   Franz Ferdinand - Take Me Out
