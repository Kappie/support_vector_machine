With all the things going on in our political system at the moment, the celebration sort of slipped under most people's radar, but I did catch the last few speeches of a special debate when I got home from classes. One of the things I was reminded of was the fact that New Zealand was the first country in the world to give the vote to women, all the way back in 1893. We may have just a small country, but sometimes we are able to show the rest of the world how to do things.  Having said that, I am extremely glad that our politicians have reversed their attempt to make consensual sex legal for children as young as 12 years old. While I could see the reasoning behind the proposed change, I certainly could not agree with it. The argument that changing the law is not condoning it is farcical. The very act of changing the law condones it.  Our esteemed Prime Minister, in her usual way, is saying that it was never really an option, at least not in the way it was reported. Or is it possibly a back down (again) by a government still lagging behind the opposition in opinion polls? A cynical attitude perhaps, but on past experience... Whatever the reasoning behind the change, I am glad that it has turned out this way. If sex between children that young is happening, then education about the risks involved needs to be the priority, not simply letting it happen.  College is keeping me extremely busy, and is the reason why posts are few and far between at the moment. My somewhat scattered attention span at the moment is having trouble keeping me focused on what is important.
