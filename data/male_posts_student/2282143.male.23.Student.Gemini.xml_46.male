Lyrics are kinda cool too.  Not saying today was the greatest day of my life ever, but it was pretty good.  Today at the zoo, we got the route change approved, so we had a whole new route.  Was fun.  Actually had to think about the animals and what I was going to say.  Nothing has changed but that.  In some ways, change is good.  But not too much change.  I finally remembered what John was talking to us about in that awesome talk the other night.  He mentioned to try and do something the same for every day.  Same thing, same way, same time.  To be totally consistent.  Its impossible.  He tells us that the body likes routine.  I guess that would explain how you feel crappy when you throw your sleep pattern out of whack.  I dunno.  Lofty goal.  I dunno if I could do it.  Oh well.  Party time!
