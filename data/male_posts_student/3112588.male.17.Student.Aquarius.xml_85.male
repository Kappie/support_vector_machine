"it's a death threat!" i cant believe what kind of sick person would do something so vile as to try and hurt someone that is MY friend! hey--i know ppl in high places...so....if you dont want the italian mafia and varsity football team all over your butts..i suggest that you guys lay off, got it? yeah..laura was right in her post: this whole human race IS screwed up. her and i are going through some major crap right now. dang--we just need a vacation..."A VACATION FROM MY PROBLEMS!"
