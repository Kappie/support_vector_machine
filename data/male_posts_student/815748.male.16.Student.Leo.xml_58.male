We were talking about whether this liberalist guy would have wanted marijuana to be illegal, and the following quotes resulted:  "Someone has to take care of these people until they overdose and die." ---Ms. Heidlage  "That's why I limited it to heroin, because I knew people like you would pop up and disagree." ---Ms. Heidlage  -It's not like if they legalized marijuana everybody would be running to the nearest drug store... -Oh, I'd be out that door right away! ---Will O'Leary and Ms. Heidlage  Here are some other, non-drug-related quotes that sprung up:  "Does anyone have a wild objection to either one?" ---Ms. Heidlage, and I'm like "Waaaalawalaawalla! Not number two!"  "[Edmund Burke] has -- and continues to have -- a wide number of followers." ---Ms. Heidlage, and I'm like, "Once they get to the cemetery, there isn't much farther to go..."  "They committed a crime at the time they committed a crime." ---Ms. Heidlage  After history, we saw Charlie Heidlage in the hall, and Loren was like, "Hey Charlie! Your mom!" and I'm like "I don't think he knows what you're talking about..." and so he ran after him and explained that she was a pothead; he said she had sent similar messages during another sophomore history class.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Here's the new and revised, but still tentative, plan for the Matrix Revolutions:  On Tuesday, Veterans' Day, Jonny, John, Loren, and myself will meet at Cabot's at 10:30am.  We'll eat lunch, go to John's house, then leave when we have to (around 11:45).  John's mother will drive us to the Framingham theater, where we'll see the 12:30 showing.  Afterward, maybe we'll hang out at John's house; we'll decide that en route.
