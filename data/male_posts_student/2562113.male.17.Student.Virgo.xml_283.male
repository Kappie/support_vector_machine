For one thing, your all in the same place, doing mostly the same stuff. finding people to relate to is a lot easier than you think. So if your nervous or scared about leaving your houses and family and friends, thats good, its natural. but i garuntee that by the end of the first week you'll be living the good life. the transition from highschool to college is definilty a challenge, but if you take it one day at a time, it will be a whole lot easier.  PS: most of you guys are going to the same colleges anyway so you have nothing to worry about
