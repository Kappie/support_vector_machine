Then he calls us later and says: come in at 1!    HA!  Shows him to mess with Derek's sleep schedule, right?  Well I was ready at 10.  Just needed a ride.  Then after work we went to the mall, got some tai chi and ba gua books, I got some bevvys, and tooled around a bit.  Then I decided we visit Kim in her torture at Target.  Didn't seem happy to see me?  I don't know.  Anyway, I got my haircut before Derek and I left for work.  What a relief!  Feel like a soldier, look like a thief.  Time to slay the dragon, or eat (depending on whether I'll be eating Buddha's food tonight), and then shower and shave n'stuff around 9.  You know what's cool?  When you recognize the han zi characters for "fire" and "jong" on kung fu books.
