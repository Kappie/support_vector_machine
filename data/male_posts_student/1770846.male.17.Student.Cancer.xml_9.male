Like everyone else, I got my schedule in the mail the other day, and like most, it was really fucked up. They gave me five AP classes, and that was just unacceptable, so I had it changed on Friday. Now the schedule is final, and if you're interested:      1. Business Law   2. AP American Government   3. AP English   4. AP Calculus   5. Lunch   6. Statistics   7. French 4   8. Rotation   9. Physics      And I've got Mrs. Kaub for study hall again, which is awesome, and Mrs. Lewis for homeroom, which is REALLY awesome, so I'tll be a good year. I'm not worried about having too hard of classes. I think the only one I'm gonna have to really work for is AP Calc, and I'm ready for that, haha. This is definetly gonna be the best year of high school so far, haha.       I stepped on the scale the other day, just for the hell of it, and I weigh 167 lbs. I'm a little worried... I've lost like 13 pounds this summer, and I haven't really changed my eating habits or started exercising or anything. I hope I don't have some kind of deficiency or anything... It may be all the workouts I've been getting from my tennis lessons with Harold though... :-/      Speaking of lessons. They're really going excellently, haha. Harold says I've really come a long way since the beginning of the summer, and I'm looking forward to being at least in the top 4 when tennis season starts, haha.       I've gotta get back into the swing of SAT prep. I haven't cracked a book in two weeks, and I'm worried I may be getting a little rusty. After breaking 700 on the verbal section a few weeks ago, I've kind of relaxed my studying habits a little. Anyway, I'm sure I'll get some more tests in once I get done with the job on Monday (the 9th).       The job's actually getting a lot more bearable. I've been putting some more effort into it in my last few weeks, because I want to leave a good impression when I stop on the 9th. I'm definitely looking forward to some freedom in the last few weeks of summer. I'll probably see some more movies and eat lots of popcorn to put those 13 pounds back on, haha.      I've really got to start reading  The Odyssey  sometime. School's almost coming up, and I'm really not thinking I'll be ready for it what with the length and the archaicness... meh.
