The ground shutters.  Kafoom  A Flash of reality, and all is silent. Now your presence be felt.  Kafoom  It ceases its movements. The door is open.  Kafoom -Sunday, March 7, 2004   "The Passing" A time comes yet, When I will pass from And into this Earth. Deeper than the depths of time, Beyond the reaches or reality. In despair I will emerge, I will answer to my name. -Wednesday, March 10, 2004
