At the last inning, the score was 4-6 going 2 points down. All bases loaded. It wasn't a grandslam. It was a 2-runs-brought in by Linden Toh Xuan Li which made the gap close up to 6-6. our coach was like so damn happy. Then Sant came out to bat. With 2 strikes 0 ballz.we were all damn worried if he got striked out. But after many attempts on foul ballz, he made a slow yet tricky ball to 3rd base. Linden, from 2nd base ran all the way to home, at some neck breaking speed. Actually, the ball was thrown to 1st base but the 1st base man just somehow couldn't step on his baze properly and Sant just zoomed past him, forcing the umpire to call  SAFE . By then, Linden had already reached home and...GAME OVER WE  WIN ! Marist had just celebrated a tough fight against ACSi which the score was expected the otherwise.  WELL DONE B TEAM!
