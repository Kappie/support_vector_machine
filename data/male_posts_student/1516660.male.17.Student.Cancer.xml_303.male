In the afternoon, I went to play bball with so many cats (Huiling and her two sisters, Gloria, KimSeng, CQ, Joyce and PY). We met at Marsiling, and proceeded to Woodlands Indoor Stadium to rent courts lor. We rented a court for 2 hours, 3-5.  We played and played. At 4, WQ called and said he's coming down. YaY! Okay, I then helped HL, Gloria and Ji write their excuse letter from school on Friday (they went to SP). I spent a good 15 minutes writing. HaHa. After that, it was more badminton playing till 5.  At 5, WQ invited us to his house (Woah!! First time wor!! Haha! He never invites us to his house de!) to eat some dinner. I don't know why la, I think his parents cooked extra and need people to finish it. While waiting for dinner, we played BlackJack. HaHa. We played with money, 10 cents 20 cents only la. I think I lost in the end ar. HaHa. I only won once. That Joyce is really so lucky...such a good dealer. HaHa!   After the gambling, we ate dinner at 6. Actually, me and Gloria are the only ones who really ate. We ate one bowl of rice (the others shared) each and the veggies. I even ate another bowl. Heh heh. Like that, I don't have to waste money buying dinner le ma. HaHa. We talked about a lot of things, until WQ's grandmum chased us off (indriectly). Meow moo!  After that, me, CQ, Gloria and KS went to MacDonalds while the rest went home. KS and CQ brought food and we continued talking lor. We talked until about 7.30, where I brought the MacWings meal back for my brother.  HaHa. While walking back from Gloria's house, I held my racket in my other hand. I always feel very unsafe when carrying food without a protection (like umbrella or racket or long thingy that can beat the crap out of a potential thief). I always fear people would snatch my food away (crazy despos will). Besides, there are always gangsters in that area lurking about. So scary.   I came back at 8. I have to bribe my brother ($2) to tell my mother that I came back at 6. My mother will scold me like shit if she knew I came home at 8(and left my brother starving for his dinner). Meow moo!! I then went to bath, and came online lor.    I never seen Wendy come online for so long. HaHa. I knew she must be busy playing with her PS2. Woah! FFX ba. Meow moo! She's having so much fun with her PS2. Meow meow!! Oei, Wendy ar, if you are seeing this, come online once in a while leh. So long never talk to you le!! Meow moo meow!! (Duhz...if she reads this, she's already online. Meow!!)  Okay. I think I end le liao. See ya tomorrow (Grammys tomorrow! WEEE!!)! Bye bye!!Night blog!
