I fully realize that people will read this but don’t be so hard to judge me based on what I write.  I write when I’m upset and that causes me to write very sour things towards humanity.  Sometimes I question existence entirely.    Why do people do the things they do or say things they don’t mean.    How can people go to sleep so comfortably knowing that they’ve hurt someone.    When there’s anger between two people the outcome is usually very bad.    Perhaps ill post later when my minds more clear.    I’m afraid all the thoughts in my head are just flying everywhere right now.
