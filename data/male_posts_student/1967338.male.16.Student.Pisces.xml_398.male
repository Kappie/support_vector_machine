However I am happy that everyone (except Marten, who  (just did)  is busy and Sophia, who apparently  died ) participated in the inaugural Friday Five. This bodes well for the future.   Also Erin, It's taken you this long to see Finding Nemo? Wow...that's sad. By the way I have JournalCon news. It is tentatively set for the 30th of April (provided the Comstocks don't bail) and will double as Michael's birthday, so bring presents ( urlLink HINT    urlLink HINT ) Wow, there is quite a bit of html in that sentence! Woo!The plan for this JournalCon are to push through the last season of Sports Night AKA Dan Rydell's (nonsensical and badly plotted) spiral into MADNESS! But then we're going to do MovieJournalCon! Everyone Bring Two Favorite Movies, which will lend themselves well to commentary, of which we will watch some if not all! Please nothing R or starring Pauly Shore.   Also Yayness on my second new reader! Someone from the University of Maryland accessed my site! YAY!  Nothing ruins an evening at the movies like being struck down by the wrath of God.
