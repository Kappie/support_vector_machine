I am going to town here in a couple of minutes to get me an outfit just for the occasion. :D I love to go shopping! :)  Mikey left school today at 11:30 or so to go to Fort Worth.. :( I didn't get to see him much yesterday either. We had this stupid Spanish field trip day.. it was ok but they divided us into groups and Mikey wasn't in mine.. but yeah. Newayzzz...  Tonight should be interesting. Since Coach Manos isn't our coach anymore she's not even handing out our volleyball awards tonight at the thing. Some people said, "Oh that's so immature." But I dunno. I dunno what I would do if I were in that situation either. She just kinda got booted out of her job.. so I think I'd be a little resilient too. (right word??)  Well, I'm listening to my cd that I made at Katy's house! Katy's so kool! LoL She rode with me yesterday to Woodson for our Summer League Bball Game. It was funnnnn. Well gotta go! Later!!!!!! ~ChRiStIn
