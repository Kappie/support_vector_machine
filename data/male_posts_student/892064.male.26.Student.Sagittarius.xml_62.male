I know that there is the Moore slant on alot of the information portrayed in that movie, but still its impossible to hide the corruption and the fear that our government is instilling in the American people.  Throughout the whole movie Cyndi and I were just getting more pissed off the more that Moore kept showing and uncovering.  I strongly reccomend this to any of you who havent seen it!!!!!!!!!!!!
