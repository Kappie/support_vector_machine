Over the last few days, intelligence has come out that The United Socialist States of Angolistica, propsed a trade with The Kingdom of Edenburg for biologicial weapons. Edenburg however, declined and was just as shocked. This alarms me greatly, Freedomstaki will not stand for this. As everyone knows of the  urlLink Sahara Crisis , in which one of our low-yield nuclear weapons went off in the Sahara near The Republic of Tripolis, which sadly led to sanctions against us. The general in charge of this silo conviced his second in command with the other key that, that part was unocciuped and this was a rountine above ground testing, which acutally in pratice has not taken place since 1995. Anyways, Freedomstaki has today since frowned upon these actions of trading of WMDs or using them. I propsed to the UN, the Neutron Bomb Act which would remove low-yield nuclear weapons. Also, some actions agianst WMDs were acted upon the region, but I believe we need more. We need a Mediterranean version of the The Stuttgart Treaty. This could help ensure a long-lasting peace in the Mediterranean for maybe at least the next 50 years. Not only will this include nuclear weapons, but biological and chemicals weapons as well due the recent trading by Angolistica. This may even go further to prevent other weapons such as a Space Weapons Platform, such as in the fictional movie  GoldenEye .   I will write more about this later. That is all for now.
