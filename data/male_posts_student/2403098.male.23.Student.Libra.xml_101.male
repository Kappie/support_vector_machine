I remember where I was standing and I remember how it made me feel. I remember feeling stunned and partly angered that I was burdened with being the only one someone felt the need to stay alive for. I remember being scared, because it wasn't said in hindsight, but rather in the throws of a tormenting time that was far fromover, and therefore the optionto check-out of life was still on the table at any given time. I was angry that I had to worry about it everytime I left the house. To know that someone I cared for has contemplated, in their darkest hour, removing themselves from the bonds of human existence, only stopping the train of thoughtafterimagining how it would impact  me  was too much to hear at age fifteen. Possibly at any age.    It was eerie every morning, getting up and walking down the hallway of my parents house on my way out the door to school, and passing the gun closet. The doorhadalwaysbeenclosed, but Inoticed one morning thatsomeone (presumably my father)had taken the time to install a deadbolt lock and remove the key.Itmade me feel uncomfortable and reminded me that it was no secret what was going on. It was like the idea of "The Club" onthe steering wheel of a car. It didn't mean it wasn't possible to commit the crime if you really wanted to, but hopefully itjust made it that muchharder for the personto follow through with the actwhen no one was around. I would imagine what it would be like to be the first one home to a suicide, and wondered if a deadbolt on an entire room full of firearms would really "deter" a person from getting inside.Would they justfind another means to do it, or would it reallybuy some time, much like the club on the steering wheel, until attention was drawn to the situation and the crime could be stopped by the parking lot patrol.    Each morning as I passed the closet, I wouldturn the handleto make sure it was locked before I left the house. It was asif a reminder note was left for me every morning on my way to the ninth grade: "Don't forget, things still suck." Even if somehow I had forgotten in my sleep, there was my reminder in the form of a doorknob. There was no way out of my house other thanwalking down the hall past the gun closet.    I regret to this day that my response to my loved one's declaration that I was a reason for staying alive was: "You should have justkilled yourself" as tears ran down my face. Iwas just hurt at the idea of someone I loved talking about leaving me. I didn't mean it. Of course I didn't mean it.    Sometimes at night, before I fall asleep, I have a half-awake nightmare that my advice was taken and this person was gone from my life. I lay there andwonder how it would make me feel. I wonder if I would have felt guilty,andif I wouldhave told anyone about the conversation. And then I pray for my family, I pray for those I love, and Ipray for sleep to come.    Goodnight.
