As hard as those shops were to skip, I made the sacrifice and headed over to the multi-million dollar scenery...that no animals live on. Then I saw a sign advertising "Pygmy Hippopotamuses" and I was very impressed that our zoo had these rare creatures that are found in two zoos on this continent. Well...it turns out it was a joke, and that the hippo I was marveling at was really a bronze statue. I was so irritated by this that I didn't enjoy the meerkats at all.       At any rate, I saw the tortoise, Rocket, get fed as well as a huge snake and the otters. But the most exciting thing at the zoo wasn't the Reptile House or the Pachyderm House...it was Tropical Rainforest.      I was in the tropical rainforest watching the vampire bats drink blood, when I noticed the Liberal Exhibit next to the bat cave had a real, live liberal woman at it! (How exciting and dangerous!)      The Liberal Exhibit is a sign that muses the question: How long would it take at the present rate of destruction to destroy a section of rainforest as big as this building? Press the button to find out. (7/10 of a second!!! DUN DUN DUN!)The liberal woman was educating her young children about Evil Corporate America killing blue iguanas and destroying Mother (not Father) Rainforest. Her kids reacted like I would...running over to scare the Red-Breasted Pigeons during the middle of her rant.      "Excuse me, Miss...I couldn't help overhearing your lecture..."      "Yah. Well, I just think it's ridiculous how those corporate hogs are destroying the environment to fill their pockets, you know?"      "Well, would you rather have the yellow-spotted butterfly have to relocate or would you rather see those 'corporate fatcats' lay off those poor Brazilian loggers and force them to move their wives and children into tin huts in the jungle?"      "Uh...that's pretty...naive...oversimplified..."      "And by the way, the Blue Iguana lives in Indonesia, a country that is currently ruled by Islamic fascists. But we wouldn't want to overthrow a dictator without the U.N. Security Council's approval. We better start 'Blue Iguana Inspections'...I bet those will convince the evil dictators to change their ways.      "I don't know how you could be so insensitive...I'm speechless."     ***  Damn right she was speechless.
