Basically I think I shorted it out from static.  Not sure though.  I was hooking up a projector to my VGA port and my computer just shutdown.  When you turn it on only the power and fans come on.  No screen.  No hard drive light.  So, they hooked up my hard drive to their system and they can access it.  So tomorrow I'm bringing in my one day old external hard drive to copy all the info on if they format my drive.  They have to send it straight to Toshiba and it will take 7-14 days.  I'm really bummed.  I'm just going to have to video tape services with tapes...  and have a lot of catching up to do once I get the laptop back.  The biggest thing is the church directory is on my laptop.  And... I have to figure out how to get it finished using my home PC... Good thing I have a EMachine!!!  Ok, that's enough for now.  I'm going to bed... rough day.
