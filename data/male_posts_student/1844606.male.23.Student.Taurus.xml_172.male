Cept if I get what I want, they pay for it all.  The trade off is that I would have to re-learn Spanish and pick up a new language entirely.  That would suck a lot.  But who knows.  I've got clearance to display "No Towers" and I've been thinking of ways/where to promote the thing.  It would be great if it offends people and/or opens their eyes.  Who knows.
