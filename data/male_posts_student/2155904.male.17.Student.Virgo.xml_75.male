It started off gay as Tyke's first period teacher made him go take the final in a different room along with a bunch of other people so Tyke didn't get to say goodbye really to Tina in her last day in his class for the year.  Pretty much their time together will diminish to hardly anything.  With some people they still hang out if they don't have classes but with Tyke and Tina it isn't exactly that.  Oh well, he has moved on.  Speaking of moving on, Tyke walked right on to his next class and final final.  It was Photo.  It was fun to do.  3 people making 2 pictures, dry humping them and then matting them.  Not too hard.  And it wasn't but they did end up spending a little time after class humping it.  But it got humped and that is all that matters.  Tyke went out and walked with Kinker in the rain.  Tyke went and talked to some folks and then dropped his bag off at his car while progressing towards the hangout of Purdy/Dotti.  Purdy's bro had taken her car and she was mad cuz she needed stuff out of it.  It was a good time.  But anyway after a while Tyke went home by himself and just did nothing really.  Then the time came nearer and nearer.  His big game at the Kramm (good Kram's new spelling to differentiate between the two since the other Kram isn't bad so he doesn't like using the good and bad preface) household was scheduled for 3 PM.  Well Tyke and Kinker couldn't get a hold of Toxic Old.  So then they needed to find a replacement.  And they found a pretty good one in Big Twigg.  He certainly gave another size advantage so that was good.  Purdy and Haras came over before anybody else and they chatted a little.  Then, upon suggestion, Tyke busted out his superman shirt and cape.  This is the really tight shirt for those of you who are confused as to what Tyke means.  This shirt is a PJ top for kids about 5 years old.  And yeah, Tyke put it on.  He attached the cape too.  Pretty much one of the most amazing sites you'll ever see in your life.  Just look at the pics/vids if you don't believe so.  Haras and Purdy really seemed to be cracked up by it.  As they say, all is fair in love and war...and super tight Superman shirts.  Tyke wore the shirt to the court and was immediately able to intimidate the opposition.  They were shaking in their Team USA jerseys.  Team USA may have had uniforms but Team Good had the style and presence on the court.  Right away Tyke was feeling it.  Comedy that is, not his shot.  He was just hitting those one-liners and just living it up for the camera.  Ya know, doing it Amed style.  He was really looking good out there...once again not shooting-wise but appearance wise.  His uni was awesome.  Well, the game got underway and it was a close brawl at first.  But then the better team started to pull away.  Thanks to the dominating inside presence of Tyke Turner, Team Good just kept hitting the fadeaway jumpers over Karl Malone.  Stockton and Mullin kept trying to get their outside game going and to get some good ball movement but as Haras so rightly put, "pass incomplete."  Haras and Purdy were great cheerleaders for Team Good.  They obviously shocked Team USA by rooting against them and wanting the better team to win.  Their ability to cheer and videotape at the same time was unbelievable.  Real talent right there folks, you gotta love this game.  And those girls.  As the game droned on, Team Good was losing their touch.  Tyke couldn't find the bucket and Kinker, who had pretty much been dominating was losing some of his presence although still leading Team Good.  Kinker really did lead the team to the W.  MVP right there.  It finally came down to OT as it was all knotted up until Kinker made back to back jumpers and got Team good the win with a score of like 26-24 or something like that.  An unbelievable game really.  Hard-fought battle on both ends and Team USA really deserves some credit for sticking to it and not giving up even though their skills did not match the wily combination of speed, slash, strike that Team Good employed.  Coach was really proud of the guys.  Gave them all an extra $3.4 million bonus.  Not to mention exercising the option for 2005.  That will be a great decision.  Nobody can beat this duo of Kinker and Tyke.  Especially if Tyke can actually hit an outside shot.  Which he couldn't...he kinda choked in front of the national audience.  He wasn't nervous.  He was just weak in his right arm for some reason and then just couldn't make anything.  All in all he was pleased with his performance.  And since he seems to have kept his fans entertained while doing so, he has been a success.  Really a great activity that was.  He looks forward to many more matchups.  Maybe on a dry court with a full sized hoop and regulation ball.  That would make things easier for Tyke.  He could actually drive to the hoop without fear of falling.  That is why he just posted up every play.  Or stayed outside.  He was, oddly enough not a force on the boards as he usually is.  Probably because the ball was bouncing from like an 8*1/2 foot hoop so everybody could get to it easy.  But Team USA was athletic and quick.  They gave them a run for their money.  Tyke was truly worried at some points in the game.  But nonetheless they pulled it out.  Thanks to the wonderful fans and all of their support.  They couldn't have done it without your love and generosity.  Kudos..........Well, after that Tyke went home and showered.  Then he got his acceptance to WSU.  Not a surprise of course but it is good to know he doesn't have to do anything now but apply for another scholarship and financial stuff.  It is pretty much in the bag now.  After his Mexican Lasagna dinner Macaroon, Amed, Skippy, Kinker, and Big Twigg came over before the boys bball game.  It was fun.  Just hung out a bit and made fun of Amed like usual.  The game was alright but kinda boring actually.  No girls to talk to the whole time.  The cheerleading squad was above par since Haras and the good team (not Team Good though) were at the girls game.  Had it not been at Liberty, Tyke probably would have gone.  But that is a long drive to talk to her for just a short period of time really.  And it was still funny hearing Amed's crazy and inane comments to the Libert-arians.  Wait!  Amed should go to Libert-ay if he is a Libertarian.  That traitor!!!!  Maybe he is a spy!!!  Eat his Russian face.  Well, after the game 4 of the guys went back to Tyke's and they played some games and then Macaroon left and Kinker, Tyke, and Big Twigg watched some of Tyke's vids and played some cards.  Then they left and Tyke blogged.  And his eyes are literally so tired that the words on here are blurred.  Probably not a good sign.  He is blinded by his love.  Love of an inanimate object that is online.  That is just sick!
