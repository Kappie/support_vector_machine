When I get a new one someday, I’m going to take this one and throw it off of Stanridge Stadium and laugh at it’s piece-of-shit-oscity. Not to mention that my computer was made by some mother fucker who prolly used rubber bands and old Dukes of Hazard Lunch boxes.  NOW, let’s hope this fucking works. I wanted to let people know about how awesome the Rocky series is and that if they haven’t seen it then they’re missing out. I’m pretty sure Rocky set the standard for beating the shit out of people.     There are some things that most people don’t know about Rocky. First off, you could break cement on his rock hard abs. I say this because I’m confident in my straight, manly way of life. Secondly, Rocky, Jay Leno, Matlock, and Donald Trump all get together on Friday nights to play Blackjack and discuss how awesome they are. Nobody ever wins because they’re all unbeatable at everything.  In my book, Rocky has the world record for beating ass to a bloody pulp. A record which will never be broken.
