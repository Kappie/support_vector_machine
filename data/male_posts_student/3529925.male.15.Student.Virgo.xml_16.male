"Why is it so kickass, Kevin?" you are surely asking. Well, you get to stop the hell out of shit. That's always fun. And for the ladies... (assuming there are any that read this :P (hell, assuming  anyone  reads this...)) you get to dance. Which, as I seem to have interpreted, is most always a good thing. If none of this appeals to you, then you get to see people making total asses of themselves. Indisputably, this  is  always a good thing. Email me your name and address if you disagreeso I can bitchslap you.  Please, just email me anyway! I'm so lonely and cold.. matches.. want.. to ... buy...?
