This isn't accurate though because it was based on my system clock and that was busted for some reason that I've forgotten. Anyway, since I don't know when I posted what, I'll just spam you guys with all of the posts of a day in one post here in the best order that I can guess it was written. The format was also a little different on the old blog. I had a title, an abstract, and a body, so I'll write them in that order on separate lines following the date. It was also pointed out to me after showing my cousin the post that I wrote initially, that it cuts out the stuff between the --'s on PCs so the sig marker for my old posts will be changed to >>.   January 26, 2004  Who am I?:  Who is writing what you're reading?   I am a 16 year old male from Massachusetts who just moved back to his birth-state of California after 7 years of being in MA. My name is •••• • •••••• but I prefer meowMix and theGerm in the online realm. I am of mixed blood but I am half persian, a quarter chinese and the rest is a mix of German, Irish, Welsh, and Scottish. I am part of a family of 4 with two parents and a sister, but I have a HUGE extended family. I am addicted to StarCraft but I'm not amazing at it.  I use macs primarily and would under very rare circumstances put my money down on a Windows PC. I like electronic music (but not techno) of all types, most of rock, and some pop. And for those of you who get into that new age bigotry also known as Astrology, I was born on 11/24/87 in the Roman Catholic Calendar at 5:20 Pacific Standard Time in Martinez California.  I imagine you'll find out more about me as you read this growing blog... 	>>meowMix  There ya go. For some reason, I felt that I should introduce myself to no one. Just some updates though, since Shannon really picked up on that name, meowMix, as a real life nickname, I never use it for anything anymore except my AIM name which I am stuck with people a lot of my friends are retarded and would be confused if I got a new name. Now, if you're curious as to why I don't use it, it's just because it brings back sweet and sour memories; kinda like that chinese sauce stuff, but not so tasty and more like something that would trigger vomiting. Another note, I'm no longer addicted to StarCraft and right before I quit, I did become awesome at it, so just keep that in mind if you want to challenge me to a UMS game.  That is all. -- Feanor
