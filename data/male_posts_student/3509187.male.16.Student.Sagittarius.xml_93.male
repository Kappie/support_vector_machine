Kate, George, Steph, Micheal, Marie, Eric, Matt, Linsey and everyone else... sorry if I forgot you... its just my bad bad memory... I'm getting old...  Especially thanks to those who supported my insain crazy with a material made to fix windsheilds in WWII and then later used for ducts...   Random: Robin and I now know how to tie a bow tie and what cravats and ascots are... we also decided I am going to be a Cheese Connoisseur and she will be a Hair Dye Connoisseur. My one restriction/limitation is the cheese that scottish farmers made and then let maggots diggest for like a year and then have a big family reunion to eat even though it's is illegal to make, and Robin's is no blonde... We also decided to never let maggots dictate when we eat cheese... yeah i know its random but hey its something to talk about at 1 am...  Until I get bored again...  -Dan V
