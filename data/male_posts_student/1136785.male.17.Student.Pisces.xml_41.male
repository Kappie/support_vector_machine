I've tried to type up three posts, and something happens each time. So instead:   I  urlLink want .   Just because it's a massive blackhole of money doesn't mean it I shouldn't give it my love.   Nor the fact it has no engine. And that it would take several million, if not tens, to tow it to India to be broken into scrap that would likely be worth less.   Read  urlLink this . It's quite good. I'm about halfway through and enjoying it. And for the rest of you, it's probably quite boring. Yet Important! I'll posts some real thoughts on it later.
