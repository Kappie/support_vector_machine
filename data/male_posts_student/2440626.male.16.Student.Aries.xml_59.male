Well I will try to talk about something else.... ..."Summerland", Lori Loughlin's (Aunt Becky from Full House) new show, is so good.  I am watching the Pilot again.  I highly recommend it.  It will air on the WB on Tuesday at 9.  OH OH OH... Let me tell you about Friday.  Last Friday,  I went down to the Waterfront with Jeff, Luc, and Company.  We saw Harry Potter 3 at Loews Theatre.  The movie was awesome!  However, I thought the ending kinda sucked with the freezeframe of Harry riding off into the sunset (how cliche!).  Anyway, and the Theatre itself was so nice!!!  Then I ran into a predicament at the Snack Stand.  I had a soft pretzel (approx. $25).  Then I was thirsty.  So I bought a large Icee (approx. $52).  Then all of sudden, it happened.  I turned around, and there it was.  The ice cream stand.  And what caught my eye?  The made to order milkshakes.  So you know, I hop in the line and purchase myseld a chocolate milkshake (approx. $97.29).  So I am like "Icee....or Milkshake.  Milkshake....or Icee".  I ended up drinking both! HA!  The point of the story is that I we ate at BRAVO! Cuccina Italiana for dinner.  It was so delicious.  I had the Shrimp Diavolo.  It was penne pasta in a spicy tomato cream sauce with shrimp.  It was simply divine.  The tiramissu I had for dessery was  eccelente , right down to the chocolate-covered espresso bean that garnished the top.  Friday was a great day.  Well I think I have enough typed for today.  Buona Notte!!
