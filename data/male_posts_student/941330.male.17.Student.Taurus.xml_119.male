"really?" then mrs. johnson accused him of staring at this other freshman abdullah, "please, save the dating until after school." after school said hi to a very stressed kat (i...i will survive...!), promised to say a one-word eulogy a day for 300 days for debbie if she dies (that's...carry the two...200 words), and got some uber grape candy from liss, who is a significant cause of global warming.  part of my spiffy tone essay: "American High School is a fine place to go to for kids with long dreams and longer odds of reaching them. The claustrophobic in everyone will delight in the constant crowdedness of the facilities; we have 400 kids too many, which is less than Mission, which has slightly enough population to apply for statehood. Exercise-averse teenagers need not fret either, for we are the only school in the district to boast the revolutionary Closed Campus(tm) feature! This results in delightly long lines for food, giving waiting customers enogh time for quick tasks like finishing homework, taking naps, or watching the first 3 seasons of The Sopranos. And for that slighted Amish population, we boast working restrooms. For that rare time where you need to use the restroom."
