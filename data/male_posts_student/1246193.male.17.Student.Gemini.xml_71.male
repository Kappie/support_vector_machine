There is so much diversity but if we look closely enough is there really much of a difference between religions?  The Jews have God, Christians have God and Jesus, Muslims have God and Mohammed, Buddhists have their 33 idols...the point is, we all believe in something greater-more powerful than we are.  Someone to praise when things go right and to curse when things go wrong.  A way to explain things that we cannot possibly understand.   The dictionary defines religion as a belief in a supernatural power that is revered as creator and governor of the universe.  It also defines religion as a cause, principle, or activity pursued with zeal.  We take it too far, don't deny it for we are all guilty.  We argue, hate, and even kill others over it.  An insult against your religion is personal, as if an insult to your parents.  I have contempt for those who make me question the way I explain the unknown.  Then I turn around an insult another.    We as human beings are simply striving for an explanation.  I would prefer to believe that you will go to heaven, or the next level of being, or whatever and wherever your believe you will go, if you are true to yourself and accept only what you believe.
