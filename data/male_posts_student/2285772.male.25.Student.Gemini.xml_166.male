"i spend too much time raiding windmills we go side by side laughing until it's right  there's something that you won't show waiting where the light goes take the darkest hour-break it open water to repair what we have broken â€¦  i spend too much time seeking shelter world without end couldn't hold her  there's something that you won't show waiting where the light goes and anyway the wind blows it's all worth waiting for anyway the wind blows"  ---toad the wet sprocket, windmills  i hope the music doesn't inconvenience any of you. i'm looking into how to improve it. if you know anythin (or have a song idea) lemee know. the more comments i get, the cooler i am.
