With all that's been going on in my life I'm starting to get more and more discouraged about where exactly my life is headed....I mean not as far as my career path is concerned, I enjoy med school so far and I know I'm going to be a good doctor....no, I'm more concerned about my personality and how adversity is changing it....I used to be a super duper optimist despite my outward statements....I might play the role of a malcontent but in actuality I enjoyed my life and I felt like everything was rosey....I truly felt that each day was better than the next....  now, try as I might I just don't feel that way anymore....I wake up hoping that today I will recieve more good news than bad....today I have to perform a videotaped interview of my partner in Physical Diagnosis....I am looking forward to it....but at the same time my thoughts linger into the murky, uncertainess of my future....it's not just my dad's situation....it's a combination of alot of things....I have alot of unfinished business and with my increasing awareness of my own mortality I wonder if I will ever get to square away my feelings with the people I love before "my time" comes....hell I don't know....  It's funny cuz I had all intentions when I first signed on to blogger to list my top five movies and songs of the moment and be done with it....I have thrown myself head first into a world of music and movies....escapism at it's finest....but I know that I need to "face the music" (see where my mind is?) about my own personal problems....  I'm trying to make it....I don't know what it will take at this point....I'm lost.....
