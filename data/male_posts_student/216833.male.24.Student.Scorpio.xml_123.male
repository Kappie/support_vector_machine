I was thinking today about the point in evolution where clothes were neccesarry. I wonder if we were ever really hairy, like the ape-men we see in books. Most remains of the australopithecus africanus and homo habilis are fragments of skull, teeth, and other small bones. I am very curious as to how they make the connections from skulls.  They do resembly apes, but they walk upright. homo habilis and the others were just walking apes, hence the hair. I have been looking at people differently.  I'm sitting in traffic and all I see is a bunch of smart-apes driving machines. Fuck, that is weird.
