Todd - Way to still be friends with Bert.  NOT COOL AT ALL.  Whitey - That's cool that you almost shot someone.  Remember when you almost stabbed Chairman in your full police regalia?  You don't!?  Well it's a good thing that I have pictures!   Landon - Sweet hair.  Don't cut it before I see you in Chi-city or else!  Also, I have a present for you.  Remind me about it, or I will totally forget.  I am serious this time, you!  Also, I am still not telling you how I know about SPLEEM or PEEM.  Who else is on this blog?  Ah, fuck it, I will just update you dudes on what is going on with me:  Pretty much a lot of relaxing and getting sweet tattoos.  I finished my tattoo last week.  It still has a couple of scabs on it, but when those shits fall off I will post a picture for all to see.  I also am writing up a brief schematic for the workers revolution, while listening to the Internationale.  It's raining like a (little) bitch here today, or I would be on a bike ride.    If you want to see a sweet picture of Jack and I in vests from '99 Hilton Head, check out  urlLink Hansel.   Stas- Congrats on being mostly done with your dissertation.  Bagel - I think Philly is a little too tough for you.  Will you be living in the suburbs and commuting?    Later doots, and by doots I mean dudes,  Joel
