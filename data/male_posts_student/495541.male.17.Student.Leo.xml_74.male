I never expected to stay up this late, I just had to post something so I wouldn't feel bad about not posting.  Anyways, my schedule is really busy right now.  I hardly have time to think.  At first, the football schedule really hurt me (academically).  Now I'm getting mysefl caught up and I think I'll be ok  I get into trouble when I stay up late like this then have to get up early and work a 12 hour day.  I don't mean job, but I mean school, football and drivers ed until 8:30.  I normally take about 2 hours just to relax and get myself able to walk.  By that time I don't feel like doing homework.  I end up doing as little as possible or go in early the next day.  I'm not very smart -- I haven't used the weekends to my advantage.  The only day where I really don't have much to do is Sunday.  And even Sunday can be busy.  I'm not sure how I'm going to get myself on track, but I'll manage.  Tomorrow will be a hard day.  We lost last week against Prairie.  (I had to spell check prairie.  Why is it so hard to spell?)  "Last week'll be a cakewalk compared to what you'll have to do if we don't win this game."  That is what I have to look forward to at the end of the day.  Do me a favor and pray that I stay alive today... even though it would be too late because chances are no one will read this before practice.  Lordy, Lordy.  Oh well.  I have nothing left to say.  Good night.
