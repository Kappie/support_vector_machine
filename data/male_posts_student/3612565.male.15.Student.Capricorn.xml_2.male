She later goes on to describe that the crime of gnostic turpitude as committed by Cinncinatus C. was punished by death. Seems pretty harsh when you consider that all he was guilty of was wanting a little privacy in his life, wanting time to himself without the government standing over his shoulder and dictating his every word and movement. Everyone is guilty of this to some extent, but what do you do if a friend is hiding some very important things from you? I mean, no one's going to die over this, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that you don't need to keep secrets about me. If there's something on your mind that you want to say, it's alright, I'm not going to get mad at anyone for sharing their opinions. Thanks for listening, if you did.
