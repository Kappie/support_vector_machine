This attempt at community is important to me because although I have always recognized the fundamental  sense  of aloneness that comes along with trying to live differently, I now realize that it does not  have  to be that way.  Each day of living differently is filled with insecurity.  I've been enormously lucky that I have people around me who are willing to reveal their personal struggles and make me feel less alone.  Until this point in time, I've been rather reluctant to reveal what I personally am struggling with.  But the sense of community that I desire will only come when I put everything out there and hope for the best.  It's gonna be tough, but I'm going to try.
