Currently I'm planning on it being after Christmas, because I'll actually own all three DVDs by then, but of course if for some reason it has to be sooner I have multiple ways to get ahold of that last DVD.  As for when after Christmas, I'm flexible. I don't have to go to school until the beginning of Winter Quarter, which I believe starts the last week of January.
