Here, he quotes an imaginary conversation he had with God.  “As far as Mel Gibson goes, I haven't seen his movie, 'The Passion of the Christ,' because it hasn't opened up here yet. But I did catch Gibson being interviewed by Diane Sawyer. I did something right when I came up with her, didn't I,” added God. “Anyway, as I was saying, Mel is a real nut case. What in the world was I thinking when I created him? Listen, we all make mistakes."   I only include it here because I really thought that Gibson did very well in the Sawyer interview.  He impressed me as a reasonable man following his own passion and beliefs in the face of ridicule and derision.
