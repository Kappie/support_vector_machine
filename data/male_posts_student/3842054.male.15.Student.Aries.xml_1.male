Im glad cuz i wanted to go with a guy because im already surrounded by 800 girls that im going with. (More like 5 or 6) So thats good. And as we speak his mom is on the phone with my mom cuz "They have to talk" Whatever...     Five minutes after waking up, im still in bed, and my dad is home, and he starts banging on some door. I sit up and hes calling into the bathroom to my brother and banging on the door. 15 seconds later, my brother hasnt answered, and the shower hasnt turned off. Then, my dad is like "Oh God, something happened to him." He turns and rams his shoulder into the door, breaking the side of the door, and the handle. Then my brother screams "What" and opens the door. Well, my dad went off, and you can see why. Now we have to fix the door, and my brother should have been beaten ( I would have if i was his father), but he kinda got off.     That was the most exciting moment of my day.     We are very close to getting brittneys parents to letting us stay almost the whole day at Warped. Im so excited. Getting tickets tommorow.  Nothing has happened today.    Ive decided i want to make a music video with Ryan. I was in the shower listening to Switchfoot, and i realized ive always wanted to make a video of me singing or something in the shower. But id be wearing a bathing suit,and the camera would be showing me from the waist up to give the impression that... yeah. Well, i dont know waht song im gonna pick, but if i actually get serious about it, then ill do it.     um, lyrics....    The Vines  Ride    ahhh      that's the start the middle and the end   aren't you glad the universe pretends    if I don't get this message home   once again I'm gonna head alone      ride with me   ride with me   ride with me   home      ride with me    ride with me    ride with me   oh yea      thought alot ignored the right to be    lie me down because we like to see    the colors through your loaded mind    fuck the world and let me raid out time      ride with me   ride with me   ride with me   home      ride with me   ride with me   ride with me   oohh      im not waiting alone   im not waiting alone..      ride with me   ride with me   ride with me   home      ride with me   ride with me   ride with me   home     I was gonna choose another song, but its been too long taht i havent posted this song. Its kinda old, but its great to listen too.
