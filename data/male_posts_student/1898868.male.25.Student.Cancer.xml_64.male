That is awesome.   2) ButJustin, remember last time you ran the marathon, your piece hurt so much that you said you'd never run again?  3) Does anyone else think it's weird that Justin is going "to camp for acouple ofweeks" in Oregon? And Justin/Landute -remember the Woodsman who we used to play basketball with? That guy was rich - he was a woodsmen, yet a good all-around ballplayer. Kind of a Nate James type (except a woodsman, of course)
