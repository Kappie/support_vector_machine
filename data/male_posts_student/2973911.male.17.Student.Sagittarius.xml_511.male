Some dead end job, life in a cage that's it. So it really doesn't matter if you go to school or not you will all end up the same. How rich is a dead man? It doesn't matter no matter what subject you major or what job you get, it is all the same in the end. But as for me I have a 4.0 (that's a good thing) and that by doing all the same things I did in high school; in which I graduated with a 1.5 (that's a bad thing). So whatever good grades or bad grades I am still the same. I don't no....What was the question again?
