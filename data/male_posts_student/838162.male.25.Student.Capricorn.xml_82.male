Which is strange, for this time is usually the busiest, what with Church events to help out in, cards to write, shopping to do and Christmas dinners to eat. But over the years, I find that I only start feeling it at the last minute. Therefore there is always a rush to write cards and gift shop and then…it’s all over too soon.  I guess part of the reason why I’m so Scrooge ( Bah! Humbug!)  about holidays at times, is that I somehow always found it lacking in some way. Must be the romantic in me that has this set vision of how Christmas should be and of course it never turns out like that. One year in particular was nearly perfect, but only served to raise the standard, so to speak, that only make the following years feel even less pristine.  But now we come to this year, and somehow the old holiday spirit is kicking in extra early. And so I sit here and ponder why. Maybe it’s the really cold weather that we seem to be getting over here this year. Been doing a lot of sitting in front of my window studying as of late, with the chilly breeze a constant companion. So much so that it drives me to distraction with illusions of Winter and of such. Another reason could be because a friend was sharing their enthusiasm for the holiday, complete with tree decorating ideas and gift buying plans. Or it could be that I’m so sick of having exams cut so deep into the holidays that my mind would wander across rivers just to find something to occupy itself with rather than the topic at hand.  But like the plot for any tragic character, it so happens that this is the rare time where I actually  want  the spirit to kick it late. Mainly because I want to focus on said exams and furthermore, I’m flat out broke. So all these ideas and holiday urges… I can’t act on them!   Frustrating I tell you.  Here’s hoping your festive plans are doing better. Season Greetings.
