I actually got through the week.  I don't feel so bad about work anymore.  I've taken to not doing my homework if it probably won't be checked.  I'm turning into John.  This morning, I cut this bakesale thing for Tanzania.  Sarah ended up missing twenty minutes of math because of it.  I'm not going to get up at 6:30 to beg people for money.  Mme DeRobert forgot about my test (the retake of the subjunctive the first of which I missed while in France); this is the second time that this has happened.  Luckily, I saw her in the hall and she came over and printed one.  I'm not going to hold it against her.  I did OK on the test.  Oh, and she recommended me for AP French.  I think like everybody got in except Deena who didn't want to.  I still have no idea about the rest of my classes; and the President didn't help at all (for those of you who aren't cool enough to get it, I'm talking about Kennedy).  And then Melody came and she and Loren awkwarded me at lunch.  I never know what to do in those situations.  There was nowhere for me to go.  John said something mean.  I won't repeat it.  Oh, and yesterday Loren made a couple of purposely nerdy jokes, one of which turned out to be very dirty.  Both and John's were funny, though.  That's what counts.  There were some really funny quotes today and yesterday:  "How'd you poop on your shoulder?" ---Alex Gollick  "If selling babies for money online is wrong, then I don't want to be right!" ---Ben Landau-Taylor  "She was born and raised in Boston all her life." ---Ms. Richardson (And I'm like, man, that must've been one long labor!)  "We're not up to the 1917s." ---Ms. Heidlage  "Be aware of all the unnatural things that are happening in this play, because now, the cork has been unleashed." ---Ms. Kranes
