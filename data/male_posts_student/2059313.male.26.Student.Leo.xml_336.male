Here I am  [on the left]  before the hair cut (photo is right after a shower)... and yes, I am completely naked at time of photo.   And thanks to my good friend,  urlLink Stephanie , I was introduced to Johnny at  Studio V  in Lexington.  I  urlLink resisted  the new hairstyle at first, but eventually I got  urlLink used to it , and eventually even really liked it.  I went back to Johnny on Tuesday, and got another great hair cut, and he's a pretty cool guy to talk with too.  So here's the "now" shot  [on the right] :
