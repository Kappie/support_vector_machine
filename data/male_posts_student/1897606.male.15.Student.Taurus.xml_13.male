Example:   I'm missing your bed I never sleep Avoiding the spots where we'd have to speak, And this bottle of beast Is taking me home  I'm cuddling close To blankets and sheets But you're not alone, and you're not discreet Make sure I know who's taking you home.  I'm reading your note over again There's not a word that I comprehend, Except when you signed it "I will love you always and forever. "  Well As for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs And sit alone and wonder How you're making out But as for me, I wish that I were anywhere with anyone Making out.  I'm missing your laugh How did it break? And when did your eyes begin to look fake? I hope you're as happy as you 're pretending.  I am alone In my defeat I wish I knew you were safely at home  I'm missing your bed I never sleep Avoiding the spots where we'd have speak, and This bottle of beast is taking me home.  Your hair, it's everywhere. Screaming infidelities And taking its wear. {Repeat Four times}     What a faggot.
