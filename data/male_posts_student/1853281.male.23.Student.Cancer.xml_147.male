Have to go to my Dad's house this weekend, i really don't want to, could really care less, but it is expected, and Mom would freak if i did not. last night did absolutely nothing productive, binged on a combination of suchi, chesecurds, and luce's delivery and then vegetated in front of the television. Baah..i know that i am in a little funk here, but do i really have to be so stereotypical? pilates tonight with j-dawg.
