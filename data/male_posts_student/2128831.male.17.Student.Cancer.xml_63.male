There's a stranger here  Looking back above the bathroom sink  Every night I throw you out  Leave you stranded on the boulevard  You know that I use you up  I used you like I used a mop  Well the band's singing hallelujah  Hallelujah, Hallelujah  You're all gone. Yeah, you're all gone.  If I could have a simple love  How would it feel and what would it mean?  I'd only trade you away  For Mary Magdalene  Oh, it wouldn't make me insane And it would make me the king  And I wouldn't have to wait  Wait around for the real thing    My head full of things today, like the need to build a foundation inside so that I always know who I am. If I have unending love for myself, I'm a rock. I'll get there, I'll learn to forgive myself.  I'm grateful to have my blue rose, and all of my other great friends whom life wouldn’t be just that life without as partners in crime, to check up on each other and make sure we're taking time to be w/ ourselves and not be afraid to listen to what's deep in our hearts. As I write this, it seems new-agey, and it bugs me. Is it the cynical, hard, Virginia bitch in me? The part that never wants to admit that there's an issue? I've gotta let go of that. Listen, here is the huge discovery I've made. I think I finally found my angel Fabi, the one I've looked for my entire life. But there's a twist I never expected. Despite the fact that he exists, It doesn't mean that we are meant to be together. In fact, I realize that what he has, what I've wanted, is what I must develop in myself, and I think I have much of it already. For years I thought I was looking for someone else but I was looking for me. This realization overwhelms me right now, but it's liberating as only a true catharsis can be. I feel a lot of fear and a lot of love. I found a new world in my heart, ha! Amor y lucha, amory y lucha, porque in la lucha, hay vida.  BABY, YOU AND I will find each other and eachother together!  I heart you my beautiful baby boi!  Lata’ moi Chica  Most folks experience a lot of difficult shit but shine so hard. Nevertheless. But then...don't know why I'm thinking about this on a beautiful day, about friends who f'ed themself up on purpose? ...If I was the husband of an acrobat would I look like the living dead. Boy? You're on the wire and can't get back, let's talk about the living dead. Could have had a car, could have had it all, could have walked in the sky but we stare at the wall. I know where the money's gone, I know what you do. ‘Cause I've seen the hole in your arm, and the needle's a much better screw. But oh, what will you do alone? ‘Cause I have to go! Sometimes I still feel guilty for walking away, but I know I tried my best and if I'd stayed, I would've gotten dragged down too.
