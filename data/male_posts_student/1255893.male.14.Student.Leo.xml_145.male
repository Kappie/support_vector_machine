I'll jus call it my gurl on the go blog :-P W/ that spirit in mind, here's excerpts from today:   Oh man. Like, the day after I wrote this whole sh@t I started talkin to Aubrey. She such a philosophy whore :) Damn she's awesome! :) LIFE ROCKS!   Yesterday I went for a hug from Sara, and like ... she backed off. I dunno, Felt a lil bad. like I did something wrong. I don't think I made her uncomfortable... But that still coulda been it. I asked why and she said There was no reason for it. She wasn't looking @ me while she told me though.... so I can't believe her. I don't Think I'll ask for hugs from her anymore... it jus made me think I make her feel bad or wierd of something. I'll jus be getting more from others :)    There's so much I forget to write about ... I mean TYPE into my blog. Good thing I'm writing all this sh@t down :)
