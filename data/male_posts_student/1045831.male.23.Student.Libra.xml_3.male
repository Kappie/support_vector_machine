That should help me get my grade somewhere near that A that I nee.  Kind of Scared about my Physics grade though.  Doing well in all my clases but that one.  I'm going to have to go talk to her about that next week but tonight I am going to not worry about it.  I'm going to Abe and Jakes to drink beer and listen to some good tunes.
