Coincidentally that meant one without Jews. His intentions were (venerably) good, but it was his actions, NOT his intent that defined him. He slaughtered countless innocent millions. You kill people, you are a murderer. Simple as that.  You do something out of good will, but end up fucking somebody over, then you are a jackass, simple as that.  Intent is nothing. You cannot feel intent, you cannot touch it, smell it, or hear it. Actions are really the only thing of importance. You could love somebody with all of your heart, but if you do not show that love, you are, essentially, not in love with them. You can say "I love you" I love you" "I love you" all you want, but, it means nothing unless you show it. Whether that is being there for them, supporting them, never leaving them to be alone, or just simply not hurting them.  So then what is a dream? A dream is something that you aspire for, or so I've been told. But, in much the same fashion as intent, dreams are intangible. However, unlike intent, dreams can actually do something. Your dreams, your ambitions, your aspirations push you to achieve, to do the things you must do, to get you to the place you must go.  Alas, here I am, cold, stupid, and naked, and a far cry from my dreams, and from reality, for that matter. Or so I would think. Is there something I did wrong? Is there something I failed to do in execution? Or was it, perhaps, that my dream was simply unnatainable. The wrong dream, so to speak. What was that dream? I wonder now. What was it that I drove so unequivocally towards. That dream, my friend, was happiness. Happiness, however, is different to every person. Happiness to Ghandi was world peace. (Back the the Hitler analogy) Happiness to Hitler was blonde hair and blue eyes for all. To me, happiness was something special. Happiness was being with the one that completed who you were, who loved you as you loved them. Happiness was undying love. Happiness was falling asleep without a tear, and wanting to wake up the next morning. Happiness was some day marrying that loved one, and then bringing a precious life into this world. Yes, I know I'm only sixteen, but that doesn't mean I can't want to have kids later on in my life! Happiness was love.  But was that too much to ask? I suppose it was. It must've been, as, herein, happiness is for the most part, unnatained and unfelt. You know, I've had this dream for quite some time. I think I could safely say three years. Perhaps closer to two? I don't know, my memory isn't all that great. Anyways, for the better part of that time period, I've been quite unhappy, and for more reasons than just failing to achieve my dream, failing to find love. I could speculate that it was perhaps circumstance that foiled the attainment of my dream. I was unhappy, and therefore wanted to be happy, perhaps this dream was borne unto the wrong circumstances, selfish ones, so to speak, and therefore could not come to pass. Doubtful, but an explanation is an explanation.  No, that's not right. A better answer would probably be that it was MY fault. I'd put money on it that I fucked myself over. Somehow, some way, I know it is my fault.  I used to blame God, or whatever higher power I could think of at the time for my problems. Everyone goes through the whole "Why, God, why!?" phase at one point or another. Now that the existence of such a omniscient being eludes me, the blame has come "down to earth." Pun intended. Whosever fault it may be, I at least have it narrowed down to who it is NOT. It is NOT her fault. I know that. It is not her fault. It can't be. Hey, if I had to blame someone, it would be simply bad luck. If such a thing does indeed exist, then it is the fault of Lady Luck. The wrong place at the wrong time.  Back on the subject of intangebility.  When someone is trying to find themselves, or find reason, or guidance, or whatever it is that they are looking for, they often tend to look inside of themselves, into their thoughts and motivations. That, in my humble opinion, is where they go wrong. If one wishes to find themself, they need only to look straight ahead, at their hands, in the mirror, wherever. Just not inside. Because inside does not exist. Look at the things you have done, they will tell you what you need to know. If you fly around and save people's lives,then yes, you are, in fact, a superhero. No doubt about it. If you do just the opposite, then there is a more than likelt chance that you are a supervillian.   When it comes to me, however, things get a little tricky. Although I suppose it does with most people. What if you both save lives and ruin them? What are you then? Neutral? I think humans are very Black and White beings, and therefore neautrality does not exist. Perhaps grey, but not neutral.Yin and Yang, baby.  Well, me, I choose black. I've fucked up a hell of lot more things than I have saved, done more harm than good, and caused more tears than any one person deserves. I'm one evil fucker. MUAHAHAHHA....Egads.
