Well, no I don't. I'm happy thinking, it just that sometimes...  Daena, Shi Hui and Amanda gave me a neat cylindrical box today. Cookies and bright pink ankle socks. A nail file and a neat card came along with it too.. Sweet.  Went to check out Lufi's band. syawla evol they're called. Good stuff, tight and all, but I see to much Sean Paul and Linkin Park influence in them. Also, there's no salient structure to most of their songs and the tunes aren't exceptional or clear. Too much happening at a go. They all switch instruments throughout the gig and even brought in a sax for a solo. Highly impressive. I feel there was too much of a blues, swing and jazzy feel to the music. Waaaay to much instrumental too. That doesn't cut it for Singaporean audiences. I could critique till the cows don't wanna come home, but the question remains, could I do better.  I ought to find a way to make this an interactive blog so that my readers can interactive.... (Duh Tim... that's why it's called an INTERACTIVE blog)... eeehehe..  Till tomorrow friends.
