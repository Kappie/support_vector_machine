I'm only mildly dissappointed, more-so that I won't be heading into Lexington today than anything.  Maybe the weather will lighten up a bit and I can get out for a little while this afternoon/evening.  I don't mind staying at home, but I don't like to HAVE to stay at home.  I like the freedom.  But for now, I'll enjoy my time, and maybe continue rearranging my room a bit.  For anyone that's out and about, I hope they are able to make it to their destinations safely.  I wouldn't want to lose anyone that's special to me.
