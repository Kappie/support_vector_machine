Practice was hard but it would have been better had I not drank really hot water that made me sick. Cyndi came to see me...that sexy punk straight up burglarized my house! Its ok because i take it as a compliment. I walk all up in my best friends house, its just how things work. It was really great to see *her* because I was missing her. Hopefully I can spend more time this weekend with her. I burned some dvds tonite, I'm a pirate, bootleggin is so fun! Anyway, I think tonite Ill watch bootleg fight club and play on the internet, fun huh? Thats about it for now.
