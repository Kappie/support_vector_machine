Talked to Katha about random stuff, can't remember really. 5 minute showers at meadowmount and other camps were the topic of interest. On the way to pick up my sister my dad goes... Dad:"So you want to do it this afternoon?" I was rather shocked, this is my father after all. Noah:"Do what?" Dad:"You know.. it!" At this point I'm contemplating how much force I'd have to exert to break through the window and after that land softly on the expressway going 70 mph... Noah:"What is 'it'?" Dad:"You know..." Noah starts reaching to unbuckle his seatbelt. At this point I didn't care HOW I landed on the expressway. Noah:"What's 'IT'?" Dad:"Get an electric guitar."   My dad has been wanting to get one for years. My mom isn't too happy with the idea so as a consequence I guess my dad resorted to calling the action of "getting a guitar", "doing it". An electric guitar would be fun though... I could get a pick-up for the mandolin and put distortion on it... crazy. Shostakovich on a distorted mandolin. Can't beat that.
