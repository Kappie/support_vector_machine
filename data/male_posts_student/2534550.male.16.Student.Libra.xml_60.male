Not being able to sleep at night because you’re not sure whether or not you will ever see your family again. Every day waking up not knowing if it will be you’re last. Its DATE at TIME the kids are anxious and waiting for their breakfast, you are thankful for one more night. You’re child asks you, is it over yet? And you cant say anything for fear of hurting your child. There’s a flash of light and no sound is heard. Then in an instant you’re the only one left. With a pain that will not subside. You look around and there is your child on the floor, his face unrecognizable with burns. He’s not moving, you go to pick him up and his head falls from under his body. You turn to your wife hysterically crying and she cannot hold you because her arms and legs are gone. You move up to her grasp her in your arms and after one last breath she’s gone. It is my duty, in conjunction with knowledge I have acquired throughout this case to lay before you evidence pertaining to the dropping of the atomic bomb in Nagasaki, and Hiroshima. It is not a question of whether or not the bomb was dropped, but is a question of the justification of this action by the United States. The murder of NUMBER civilians is under no means justified, and the prosecution WILL persuade YOU, the civilians, that under no means is the murder of thousands of civilian lives justified. Think of your mother, your father, your siblings, your child, and even your dog and tell me that you would be willing to lose them on the terms of war.   Well kids ill c ya soon
