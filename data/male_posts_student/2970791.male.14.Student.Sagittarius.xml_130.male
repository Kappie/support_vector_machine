Each team also gets their own Brain-Eating account.  For one week, each team tries to eat more brains than the other team.  You may affect B of D, however the changes must be fixable.  Doug and I would be on seperate teams, and would not make any new administrators or delete old ones.  Vote in the new poll to vote on whether or not this is cool.
