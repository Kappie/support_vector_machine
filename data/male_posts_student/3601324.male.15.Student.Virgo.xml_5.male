I don't know what is about Portland, but I'm quite fond of it. The architecture is wonderful, and the way the sun shines onto all the adjacent brick buildings is simply beautiful (I'd make that sound  less  corny if I wasn't so tired). I never really noticed how diverse it is though. I mean, Maine is definitely one of the least diverse places in the United States, but I did see quite a few different races and ethnicities. Some French (maybe) lady even bought some plants from me whilst talking some kind of... Franglish? That was pretty weird. She called me "bebe." WTF? XD  So after a long day of selling plants, we packed up and went to the bar that my dad frequents. While he talked to his friends, I attempted to find the comic store that the guy at the Casablanca Comics in Saco also runs. With no prevail. I'll have to find a map, since that part of the city is FREAKING HUGE. And the people that live around there scare me. Thugs.  I'd go to sleep now, but going to sleep at 9:00 is a sin. Even for an atheist.
