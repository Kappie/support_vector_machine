I am currently experiencing the biggest  artistic stump  in my entire life... its  frustrating! , i can't draw whenever i want to and when i  do  draw... it aint good enough for me! so i wont post it in DA! argh! i've been pre-occupying myself with a lot of  music ,  alcohol,  and some  late night clubbin'  every once in a while... ahehehe... im turning out into what the culture i line in calls a " GIMMIKERO "!!!!!!!   OH MY GOD!   this definately isnt good... ahahaha... but it sure is fun... lots and lots of chicks! ahahahahahaha... anywayz... i really should focus on getting back to drawing stuff that i like... hmmm... probably when i figure out how to change my style. aheheh... tell then... *Transmission End*
