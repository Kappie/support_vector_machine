Most of them is self-consciences of beauty and tend to try ways and means to touch up themselves to the utmost style. Just to attract a few seconds of glance from others, they would be contented enough.  The major problem is, uglyness will be overwhelmed by beautiness in the near future, as I have said earlier, increasing more people becomes good-looking. Which also means fewer people will be ugly and they might be discriminated and despised by the good-looking ones. Although they are taught in school not to think of this way, they would eventually make a barrier in their mind. Human nature has this tendency, which is inevitable.  I have sent my photos to countless strangers over the IRC and they have quite a few interesting comments on my looks. I shall not disclose it anyway because it's embarassing. Look, the ugly people would feel the same embarassment as I would do if they go out on town. They would definitely cover their face and bush in shyness because everyone is staring at them and laughing. Just like a person wearing a singlet with shorts and slippers to a wedding dinner. They would immediately be in the center of attraction in no time by the cool and stylish crowds. And it's not a norm to be ugly anymore.  Not only that, they also suffer for not being themselves. They have to do hairstyling and make-up before stepping out of the house. They are simply being dominated and manipulated.  Another problem arises is the balance of the university, if almost everyone in this world is good-looking, there's no balance and it affects everything aroound such as there would be high chances of people getting AIDs and result in increasingly over-crowded population matter. Let me explain that in more details, people will have sex with numerous various kind of partners because they have no difficulty in finding their ideal partner and that which in turn, results in more unwanted babies born. You will see people flirting all the time, it can be in school, office, clinic, hospital, restaurants and etc.... Imagine this... more people die at early ages because of AIDs, more babies infected with AIDs. Soon 9 out of 10 people are AIDs patients, economy fall in crisis and riots everywhere.  There will still be many more problems that will arise sooner or later if this is not fix immediately at the early stage, this is something to be taken quite seriously and carefully. So my advice is better put the action into an end and save the world from destruction.   Please stop making-up and hairstyling yourself to look beautiful and good-looking from now onwards, everyone plays a part in contributing to a better society.  Just remember what I have told you.
