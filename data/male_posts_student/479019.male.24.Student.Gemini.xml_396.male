I doubt she does... but I dunno, someday she might hear a revised version of what I'm gonna rant about. I really feel embrassed, guilty, and upset at myself for ruining a friendship that I felt was really great. I feel like I fucked up. She's really giving me the impression that I'm continuing to fuck up and I feel really shitty about it. I don't know what it is. Is it that my words are coming out in a way that's offending her? Or I dunno... did I fuck things up so much that when we talk, it's awkward? I don't know. Is it something on her side of things?  I honestly have the highest regard for her. I still think she's an amazing person and I'm happy for her that she's happy. I've rarely ever heard her utter the words that she's happy in the time that we've talked... and it's great to see. I genuinely care about her and perhaps the fact that I care about her is the reason why I'm so upset that things are the way they are. I don't want a burnt bridge.  **
