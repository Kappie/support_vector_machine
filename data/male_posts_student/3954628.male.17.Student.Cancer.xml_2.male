Well, Lord, I have SINNED today! Alex, my Fiction teacher, has assigned us 20 pages to do over the weekend, and due to the Iowa Young Writers' Studio schedule, I was able to do a whole THREE yesterday! So, here I am, I need 17 pages more, and I have done 11 total. Go me. It's 2:54 in Iowa, which means I have been working for TWO AND A HALF HOURS already. ARGH!! I'll be lucky if I'm done in two and a half hours MORE! Oh well, it's an interesting story. Maybe I'll post a link to it sometime if anyone wants to hear it or even VISITS this blog. Well, I can't spare any more time, so...I hope you're having a better day than I am!
