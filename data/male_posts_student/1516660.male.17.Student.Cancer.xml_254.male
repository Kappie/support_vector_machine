Like what I am gonna do today ar, things like that la. Ha. Today, we are not gonna go out to eat breakfast. I ate the cake thingy. Fak kou in Cantonese. Hmm... Nice.  Anyway, I went online as usual. Hmm. No replies to my posts. The author did not come online to prod me more about my theories. :( Anyway, after some random surfing, I went to play my PT until lunch time. YaY! I got a new staff. Heh Heh!   We wait for Edwin to come back then we went out to 768 to eat lunch. All of us ate chicken rice. Halfway, Courts called and reminded Dad to pay the bills. Sigh! So kiasu them.   After lunch, me and Dad went to Causeway Point. HaHa. Actually, I am going thwere also because Dad wants me to pay the TV license while he go pay the installments. Moo meow! My first time paying for the bills. HaHa. I was quite lost which counter to go to. It is "all Transactions except SpeedPost" or "Bills Here". I went into the transaction queue and I was right. Heh. It's a no-brainer actually. Meow! After bills paying, we went home lor.   Hmm. I went online and surfed. WQ was online! HaHa! Finally a cat to talk to! Moo meow moo! I chatted with him until he went to bath. After that, I play PT until dinner. Heh.  Hmm. Dinner was very delicious. We had the small lil pig for dinner today. Oink Oink! Okay, after that, we had shark fin!! YaY! My mother cooked it herself! Nice!! Nice!! I loved the shark fin soup!! Meow!! Pepper galore! Heh Heh! Very very nice! There's crab meat inside. So sumptous! Meow meow meow!   After bathing, I came online lor. Hmm. Tomorrow I am eating laksa. Ahh. Not because I miss laksa! No no no! I want to get back at that idiot! For two times!! Two times she offended me! One: She put spring onions in my fishball noodles (even though my Mother say not to), she said in her defense "It won't kill you" and laughed! Two: The laksa leaves incident. TWO TIMES ARE TOO MANY TIMES! I cannot tolerate this! I am making my mother buy laksa tomorrow for breakfast. Knowing her, the vendor will msot probably put laksa leaves! So, I told Mother NOT to pay if she put laksa leaves! Ah ha! That will make her lose a business, and if no-one comes to buy laksa, she would have wasted making a bowl of laksa!! Serve her right then! She will learn her lesson! LISTEN TO THE CUSTOMERS! THEY ARE ALWAYS RIGHT! Meow! Revenge is sweet! Well, if she didn't put, then good for her.  Okay. I feel so good after letting this all out (even though I said this during dinner). Meow!! Okay, I gotta get going. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
