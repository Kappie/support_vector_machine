I fully agree with  JR  we have plenty of worthy blog-topics, but none of us wants to actually blog about them!  I think it would take a long time to blog about the little incident yesterday and its profound effect upon our little social lives. So, lets just talk about that later, alright?  The   pictures  for the site will be worked on a little this weekend, I know we only have the happy faces so far, I think I will edit the sad ones so that we can begin to use those, ha ha! Other than that, I dont know what else we have to do for our "Operation".   We've kept a new quote each week, implemented some pictures, created a logo for the site and added some cool links. I think that is about it for now. Maybe we should add a hit counter or something to track how many people actually come here. That would be really cool!  Anyway, this is   Nick  signing off of the   Morning Shift .... Stay tuned!
