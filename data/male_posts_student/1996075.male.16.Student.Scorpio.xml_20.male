Anyway, yeah didn't get much sleep last night...thinking about other things, just like i have been all day today too. I'm so out of it and just all-around insane. Homecoming was AWESOME. Definitely a weekend to remember. Knowing me i'll probably post more about it later, and so will lauren but yeah back to e-mail. This class is so useless...  rAr ~Christy (a.k.a Lickit)
