Dad had his b-day celebrated on Sunday since he had to work today anyways.  So I woke up around 1030ish today and began doing my devos. Read up on Acts 2 today when Peter addresses the crowd about how the Holy Spirit was with them. Afterwards ate some breakfast from McD's and then went out to get my glasses, and also buy some clothes.  Apparently though my glasses were sent to White Oaks because their machine broke yesterday. So to kill time for another hour, bought my clothes then, then picked up my grandma from church, since she had fellowship this morning.  After taking the other people home, once again I go to Masonville to get my glasses. Saw Lina walking there while I was driving *haha* and then FINALLY got my glasses. Refitted lenses with no scratches or chips ^_^. Afterwards since it was already 130, and I had to get to head2head by 2, I just told mom to drop me off at a bus stop and I bused my way to downtown.  Muahahahaha though John and Josh called me saying I was late, really I was still 5 minutes early...ACTUALLY 5 minutes early, unlike Lina's watch. Anyways back to the subject *gah my writing is depriving over the summer* I arrived at the bus stop, and ran my way to h2h to prove I was early.  When I got there, my phone said I was 1 minute late, John's phone said I'm 40 seconds early, and Josh's watch said I was 3 minutes late or something like that. Point is, I made it, and then Arjun came too, and we commenced gaming for 3 hours.  *3 hours and a bit later, back at home*  I am pretty sure you probably don't care about my bus ride back, so I'll just get straight to the point...  Drumming has been a "baat poh" lately *Ha..Ha..Ha...I wonder if Dan or Gavin is reading this,* due to my lack of time sense for triplets...quarter note triplets. They are probably the most annoying thing to conquer in music. So drummed for about an hour today, with 40 minutes of it trying to figure out triplets of all sorts. I count in 3's now.  Afterwards, for the rest of the night *timeframe from 8-11* I spent an hour from 8-9 figuring out abit of CSS and HTML, and then from 9-11 watched "The Replacement Killers" on CityTV...  Even though Mira Sorvino is very "yeet" *Ha,ha,ha what a crummy joke I know*, holy crap does that movie suck. The plot is HORRIBLE. I watched it because when I first watched it when I was 10 I didn't get it, hence why it sucked, but now when I watch it again....IT STILL SUCKS. Watching Chow-Yun-Fat run around with Mira from some Chinese mob that eventually gets owned by a UPS truck, a few pistols and a TOTAL lack of Martial Arts *WTH!? Chow-Yun-Fat with NO martial arts? W....T...H...!?!?!?!?!?!?* makes this movie VERY crummy, except for the fact Mira is "yeet" *SMPGO! Jokes Dan haha...* Maybe musical triplets aren't the worst thing in the world...  So here I am now, blogging yet AGAIN. 192nd post of the year. Wow...almost @ 200. Well anyways I'm out for now, probably going to watch TV again or chat on MSN.  By the way, SMPGO *siuing my pei goo off* is the new form of LMAO.  Cheers.
