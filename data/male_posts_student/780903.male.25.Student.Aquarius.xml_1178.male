The  urlLink undergraduate theater group  I was part of has its spring production this weekend, which two of my friends are directing; and one of them is in  urlLink this off-Broadway production .  With the first of those happening only this weekend and the second one closing this weekend -- and no reason why I can't study just as well at home as at school (well...) -- I thought it was well worth the trip.    Also just wanted to acknowledge my friend and colleague Adam White's announcement of the hopefully-temporary end of his blogging days, due to a clerkship, and a wedding (one sounds like more fun than the other).  If you haven't been reading him at  urlLink White Noize ,  urlLink Ex Parte , or  urlLink Southern Appeal , well, it's too late now.  Although there are archives.  On the bus ride from Boston this afternoon, I balanced my Tax studying with the New Yorker's humor issue, which had been sitting on my shelf for a couple of weeks begging to be read.  If you haven't read it, look for it -- it's worth it.  Interesting articles on Aaron McGruder, creator of a comic strip called "Boondocks," Hallmark greeting card writers, politicians trying to be funny, The Farrelly Brothers' modern adaptation of the Three Stooges shorts, the lives of just-starting-out stand-up comedians in New York, and some other pieces which I liked less than these (or, heaven forbid, read the first couple of paragraphs and then skipped past) so I won't mention them.  I flagged a  page that mentioned that some of the best sellers among Hallmark cards are those that come from lots of people -- "Happy Mother's Day from the two of us," "Happy Birthday from the whole family," "Happy Anniversary from your husband and a bunch of his friends," etc. -- which gives me an idea for something, but I'll let it percolate for a day or two and see what happens.
