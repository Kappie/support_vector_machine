"I saw the opening maw of hell,   With endless pains and sorrow there; Which none but they that feel can tell-   Oh, I was plunging to despair.  "In black distress, I called my God,   When I could scarce believe him mine, He bowed his ear to my complaints-   No more the whale did me confine.  "With speed he flew to my relief,   As on a radiant dolphin borne; Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone   The face of my Deliverer God.  "My songs forever shall record   That terrible, that joyful hour; I give the glory to my God,   His all the mercy and the power." -Moby Dick  Finally, after several days, I have begun to read the more interesting pages of Moby Dick. The current chapter that I am on (Chapter IX. The Sermon) seems so interesting, that I decided to stop after that last quote. So that tommorow, I may have another interesting quote for my entry.  Today is the second day that I took Zoloft, so far so good. Every once in a while I will feel like there is something wrong with me, but nothing really is. It's just my mind getting the best of me. However, my mind doesn't seem to be messing with me as much as it did for the last medication I took.  I went uptown to play some basketball. At some point, my friend Andy drove up and we chatted for a while. He was telling me about this kid who wanted to fight him, for what reason I do not know. Anyway, he was telling me that this kid, and a friend of his showed up at his girlfriends house when he was there and wanted to fight. Her dad was outside mowing the lawn though, and when he saw he came running. They saw him and took off in their cars. Why is it that this county is full of such pricks? Always wanting to fight for some stupid reason or the other.
