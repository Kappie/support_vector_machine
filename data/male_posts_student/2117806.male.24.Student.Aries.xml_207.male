But I got back from my aunt and uncle's place yesterday evening, piddled around for a couple of hours, and then did some reading. I was sitting in bed, reading my book, and I start to feel tired. I look over at the clock, which reads 11.00 pm. I think, "y'know, there's really nothing keeping me awake. The Master's Thesis has been sent to my committee, so I don't have to stay awake all night working on it. I  could  go ahead and go to sleep..."  So I did. God, it was glorious!  Also found out that the cost of having my window won't be quite as bad as I originally thought. Turns out the guy I talked to at the glass place on Main Street is a moron and confused the window I needed with one that opens or whatever. Yeah, the cost of replacing my window with the correct item is something closer to $225--still kinda expensive, but a good $200 cheaper than what the moron thought it'd be.  So yeah, it's been a pretty good day. Anyway, I'm off to do some writing. Maybe I can make some headway on "Peas."  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: Toad the Wet Sprocket, "One Little Girl"
