I have just realized that other people have sum of these "problems" like me.  We seem to...have, PROBLEMS, releasing our true feelings toward certain individuals...or...ALL individuals.  We, as Molly has pointed out in her blog, are EXTREMELY manipulative.  We say and do things just so that people will act certain ways or do certain things.  We talk behind peoples backs and say terrible things about them but then act friendly to their face.  I forgot where I was going with this...I'm felling very.....apathetic at the moment.  Yet, I'm caring so much, once again, behind peoples backs.  Peace Out!  Spense
