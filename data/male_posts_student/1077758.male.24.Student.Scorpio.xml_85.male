So she's trying to think if we have anything for them to drink back at the house.  Her brow purses as she thinks.  "Mountain Dew." I reply, "Mountain Dew?" "Didn't they like that the last time they were at our house?" "I think so." Mom frowned.  "If it isn't what they like, will you drink it?" My eyes widened a bit, and I paused. "Well, yeah." A small look of relief blew across her face like a swift breeze.  "Oh, good."  Can she really not remember what I like to drink?  Is it that hard?
