There's been a lot of speculation about google and its growing mass.  Speculators believe that Google may soon start releasing software for use in searching your own desktop for files.  And about gmail--those who know about this sort of thing have noticed that gmail is very intrusive.  Nobody really deletes emails from their 1 gigabyte of gmail storate, but it is possible, although apparently Google will always have your emails, even if you see them as deleted.  And then of course the google ads, specially tuned to advertise specifically to you.  I really don't know if it's something to worry about or not.  On one hand, google has done quite a bit for us, and is a wonderfully useful tool.  On the other hand, any company that is growing so quickly and expanding into so many different regions is to be questioned.    My crazy hairbrained theory about Google that I made up the other day is as follows: Google appeals to the computer-oriented folk.  These people are Google's main following, and feel that the infallible Google could never harm them.  Then, Google slowly expands into everything--every technology, every field, every commercial product.  Soon we have toasters that consult google as to how you should have your toast prepared, and vacuum cleaners that occasionally report in on your cleaning habits in order to better suggest a good brand for a replacement vacuum bag.  And now Google owns the world, when their start was nothing but a search engine.    I don't believe it, which is good.  If I did I'd probably go insane.
