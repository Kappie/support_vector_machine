Been 2 weeks since I have last spoken to her. I guess that things will be going good for her. I know that we are going to lose in touch , unless she deicide to get back in touch with me. Wonder if anyone really cares about how i feel . Keep thinking for how long am I going to keep wishing that some one would come and save me. The e is no one to come and save me thats the bottom line. Good things like that happen only in the movies not in real life. In real life u get hit and walk on. Paula’s mums in Prague, I wonder if I’d ever get to travel like that . Travel around the word, but doesn't it all boil down to just one thing? Money! "It's all about the money" Planning on visiting Jammu and Kashmir.. prolly in Jan/Feb, before the snow melts . Just don’t want to come back from that trip who know what can happen, a bomb can go off and some really exciting stuff can happen.. If not.. Hell I’d have just visited j and K  we all make plans and work towards them some come through and some fade away plans are reasons, for which we live the hurt, pain and other emotions they bring.  Lisa said that the new housemates are moving in next week and we need to get the house cleaned up by then.  I watched Manoj kinght Shamlyans, Unbreakable. It was weird. A tale of a morden day superhero whos unbreakable literally. I guess it answered qustions about can an ordinary man live a dual life as a father, husband and employee on one hand and a superhero on other. Samuel L Jackson plays this guy who's trying to convince Brucel Wills that hes a superhero.
