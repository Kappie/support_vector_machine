I apologize to whomever I spoke to for my spelling and the lack of sense I made. I was falling asleep as I was typing.... Guys, I've figured out what makes Mrs. Knox so hot. It's her impeccable grammar... at least, that's what does it for me :-[ derp...    ----    I never saw the Xanga GV Blogring until Cate brought it to my attention. Bastard! The blogs in that ring are so horrible they almost make Johnny and Kris' look good (  almost  ). I got physically sick reading that shit. None of those people should be alowed to have blogs; they're either too boring, grammatic eyesores, have no personality... Fuck it, they're not worth my attention... They've totally ruined my oppinions of two really hot girls, and one that aint bad looking.    Guuuu    ----    Greg, the campus security officer, just asked me:     "Ah-eweinnakih-wihPAT?"    "What?"    "Ah-eweinnakih-wihPAT?"    "Am I in WHAT with Pat?"    "Ah you innakih..."    "In the WHAT?"    "Innakih-- you know-- Ahyou relatet' to'uh?"    "Oh,   in the kin  ? No, I'm not..."    Greg is very black and very southern, both accents and dialects on top of each other make for such an otherworldly garble that one would be lucky to recognise that he is trying to speak English. What is it with these people who, when asked to repeat themselves, repeat what they said the exact same way they said it the first time; same metre, timbre, and tempo? Can then not understand that there was a reason why they were asked to repeat themselves? Do they think they speak with such eloquence that their listener asks them to grace their ears with such marvelous words a second--third--fourth-- time? Worse yet, they use the same damn words as they did they first time. People get locked into hearing a certain word the wrong way and no matter how many times you say it they'll think you're saying something else... Say it slower. Articulate. And rephrase, God Damnit! ----- I'm thinking about growing a goattee or something thereabouts. I've tried it before but shaved it off after a week. It gets to a certain point where you feel like an ass; you may look good with a four-day growth of beard, but between the fifth day and until it starts looking like a beard, you look really, really stupid. It's a pain growing the shit, too, because it itches like a muthafucker. My blonde friends try to grow facial hair and it drives me up the fuckin' wall. I can't be seen with them because they look too rediculous.  Not only do they not have enough facial hair to grow it out, but they're fucking blonde, and unless you look like a Viking, blonde guys shouldn't have beards. It looks stupid.  Thoughts? Should I? Shouldn't I? ------ Dave, my boss, whistles way too fucking much. When he's not talking, or sleeping (I assume), he's whistling. He tries to whistle along with the radio but he's the most tone-deaf SOB in the world. He has NO control over his pitch and only has a slight understanding of what tempo and rhythm are (fast or slow. That's all he knows.) but that doesn't stop him! ------- They played Timewarp on the radoi today (Other than Fat Joe's  Lean Back , Timewarp is the only dance I know... But I didn't dance. I was too busy overcharging some Indian guy for his book). That made my day. I want to see it in theaters this Halloween. -------- Enough with this "Stop losing weight" bullshit! Some people, every time I see them, keep giving me this bullshit "Nick, did you lose more weight? You look skinnier than when I saw you last week... You need to stop losing weight." Can't those people turn on their brains for five fucking seconds just to realize how fucking annoying that is? First of all, no I'm not losing weight, you're just standing farther away this time. I haven't been fat since last summer, you don't need to keep addressing the fact that I used to be a fat pig. Second of all, while I may be technically underweight, I could still stand to lose a few pounds of fat so my godly abs would show. Hearing the same old shit over and over from different people is fucking unacceptable. I'm going to start wearing a shirt with a FAQ on it... MotherFuckers. --------- I've got nothin'       NP: One of the most incredible albums of all time, the great   Graceland   by Paul Simon
