While I suppose I should give him props for not calling on us during dinner, I thought that the hour was sufficiently late to cause alarm (we live in the 'burbs, after all.)  The kid was representing a local car repair shop and wanted to sell me on a coupon book containing eight oil change vouchers. For this, I would write a check made out to the shop. The reason for his visit was to, "let the people in the neighborhood get to know us."  I suggested that he leave the business' address with me so that I could go over there myself and get to know them. He wanted to sell me the coupons. I suggested that, if the shop could afford to offer oil changes for so cheap that perhaps they should just lower the price for a limited time; surely that would induce many of the neighbors to get to know them. He still wanted to sell me the coupon book. I asked if I could go to the shop in person, have an oil change and then, if I liked the service, purchase the coupon book directly from the shop. He really wanted to sell me the coupon book right then and there.  Finally I told him that I absolutely wasn't interested. And, then when he began to tell me what a great opportunity I was walking away from I told him, "The only person who will be 'walking away from' anything will be you walking away from my house." I gave him some specified time to reach the other end of my driveway before I would go into a blind rage.  Sigh. You always think of the perfect things to say later on. A few of them were:  * We don't have a car anymore. We donated it to the auto repair shop trade school so that boys and girls could learn an important skill. * We don't need a car. You see that big cul-de-sac? That's where the helicopter lands each morning to take me to work. * Look! A naked woman!   * I'm so glad you dropped by. Would you like to come in for a bite?    Ah, entrepreneurship ... or is it ontra-manure-shi*? Release the hounds!
