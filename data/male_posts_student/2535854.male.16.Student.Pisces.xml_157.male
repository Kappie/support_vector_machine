Eh wait next week maybe more people so may play basketball finally..haha...Anyway got my ticket for the early dinner thing for Commencements...haha..I can just photocopy them and sell em :p ..  Anyway got my computer back from Mid Valley..and joy to the heavens my files are alright considering I just got away with murder by not backing them up....but my dad was not so fortunate and yes he lost his files..but not me! Hehe! I rock. So I wanted to test out my thumbdrive to see if it works and it does! Transfered all my files with it to my laptop from the desktop...tommorow i`m gonna write them on cd`s...although I coulda, but was lazy and wanted some excuse to online longer..haha...  Well its late...need to sleep..and I have to do a presentation for BM tommorow...til next tommorow..
