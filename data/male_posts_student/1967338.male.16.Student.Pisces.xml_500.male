Since Erin is leaving the 27th of August (something she didn't POST ON THE CALENDAR!), I call for a boycott of the King's Island trip. We already have MovieCon that week, and I don't want to rejigger the schedule. King's Island going to be lame anyway, because King's Island is over-rated and going means spending an entire day with Patty, and that's just not cool.   So, you're either in or you're out. Right now.  The ultimate starship is Alfre Woodard's forehead.
