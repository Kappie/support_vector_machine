I was initially worried that it would get screwed up, because you can't really do too many different things with my hair. I should have known better, though, because I think all of the hair stylists at the barber shop which I visit are all telepathically linked somehow. Everytime I go in there, I think I get a different barber, yet my hair always seems to come out exactly how I want it. Perhaps they are alien robot clones, hellbent on destroying our known world, cautiously disguising themselves as beauticians? Well, stranger things have happened.....  I filled out my voter registration, and mailed that sucker immediately. It's funny, but I expected it to be a much longer, more arduous process. Thanks MTV, you came through for me. (eye twinkle)  I went  running!  Yay for me! I also did like, 100 crunches or something. Tomorrow morning, I should resemble some kind of Greek god, or at least a demigod. Is that too much to ask?  I was slightly naughty last night, however, and allowed myself to order food at Denny's while conversing with the ever-so-wonderful Matthias. Shame on me. I did, however, attract the glances and soft hello of some exotic woman sitting about three booths away. Call it a hunch, but I don't think the guy she was with at the time was very happy about that, as was evident by his "I'll stab you with this fork" gaze that followed me out into the freaking parking lot when Matthias and I left.  Well kids, I think this is going to be a short one. I have a lot to do before work, including bathing, going comicing, and doing these neat new jack knife crunches that Robb showed me, but not necessarily in that order. But until we meet again, be well. Oh, and Jezra? You'd better release my penguins, before I organize my secret ninja strike force and call down a swift vengeance upon you.
