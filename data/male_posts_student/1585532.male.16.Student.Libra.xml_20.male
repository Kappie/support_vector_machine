So I'll be able to blog alot more than I used to (which was barely at all anyway).  Anyways, I've finally started soccer and its like, whoa.  Hard to get back into shape!   I'm not saying I'm fat or anything, but after that 90 minute practice, I was sore.  Very sore.  I'm happy I left my school.  Pacifica High School sucks so much ass.  Everyone there is an asshole.  I'd rather be hit by a truck than go back to that trash heap of a school full of retards.  I hate everything about that school.  Hands down.  Anyways, its funny to make fun of people who go there, and they just  get all angry but will never be able to do anything to me since I'll never go back.  Well, I'm going to go beat the living crap out of my computer, maybe that will fix it.  Ta.
