(Or in my case, that you could reach the cell phone that you use as an alarm clock a little quicker to shut it up!) Ever get so busy in life that you just want some down time when none is in sight in the forseeable future?  Just wondering.  It's a friday, so I can't complain really. Half day at the office, evening off from my extra-curriculars, and a chance to sleep in tomorrow if my body will allow it. Rather jam-packed weekend aside from that. Church, hiking, weiner-roast, etc. but I guess that's alright.  Maybe this morning is not even a bad thing, right? Building discipline, maintaining a schedule, budgeting finances and time and all that........  Still, I wish I could just float for a month or two, or (glory of glories!) a year. Does anyone else ever think how great it could be if someone would just carry us for a while. So you don't have to worry about schedules, and budgets, and whatever? If you could just do as you please for a small amount of time? *smile* Maybe that would be nice. Then again, what would that make me into at then end of all things? I guess I'm thankful for early mornings in the end. Even if I don't like them at the moment. It's still another day, and I have the air to breath and a roof over my head. Can't be sour about that!
