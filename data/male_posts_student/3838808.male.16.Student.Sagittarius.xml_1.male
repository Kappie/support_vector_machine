But i fly a lonesome flight, and i play a lonely score, i dont see no loving bears, cuz i see no love in me, i set them loose n they all ran free, leaving loneliness to me, good old loneliness for me...  this poem reflects how i've been feelin for this few days, i may seem to smile, but the wound is too deep, the feeling is too strong, i decide a poem would be best to explain... its easy to understand really... so plz jus read it for me will ya??
