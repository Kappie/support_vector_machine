Spent it watching a load of DVDs (Blackadder, One foot in the grave, LotR etc), listening to a load of random music I found (Spanish Flea, Coldplay, Collective Soul, the Return of the King soundtrack) and generally not doing anything that takes  any  effort. So now I'm feeling kinda stuffed with junk food, and I just remembered the badminton doubles tourney starts tomorrow (holy craaap). How the hell am I meant to do well if I cant even be bothered to do anything? Argh.   Also, half ma friends get 3 days off school (Mon-Wed) messing around in Buxton. Bahbahbah. I can bet any amount of cash that during those 3 days so much homework is gonna be given out, and every other lesson will involve writing an essay. Just for the sake of it.   In the other news, Bishop needs to be hit round the head with a squash raquet, they really need to change the Leisure Centre touch-tone message before it destroys whatever sanity is left in ma head, and the cold wave in hell has come to an end. Weather forecasters predict that temperatures will not drop below 50 degrees centigrade for at least another decade, and that they will most likely rise to well over 100 degrees over the next couple of days.   Buxton people: Have fun, good luck, and I'll see you all on Thursday. Everyone else: Get plotting for when they get back! >=D
