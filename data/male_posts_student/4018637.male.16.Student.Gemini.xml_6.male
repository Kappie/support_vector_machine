First the Internet was down for about a week, then everybody had excuses to get on before me, then they wouldn't let me get on so its not entirely my fault. Yeah well there's goin to be a rather large gap in my blogs, Ill try to make up for then by takin notes and stuff. Because I'm leaving for China on the 12th of this month. Ill right a journal over the period for you of my fans that like to read about me. I'm going with my Dad who is over there a lot on business so he decided to take me this time. Should be cool... Hmmm, I hate not being able to get your mind off of things. It gets really to be a real big pain in the ass. Especially when you want things to happen but they wont, or there trying to be stopped. They try to stop you from finding your way into there heart because there scared you might hurt them, and you cant convince them in all honesty that you wont. It sucks this is really hard. If young loves just a game then I must have missed the kick off. Yeah that's reminds me I cant wait to see football again. GO PATRIOTS... Yeah that's my favorite sport, In case you didn't know. Best sport on earth. So what do you guys think about my blogs tell me, I'ld like to know. I cant type as much as Id like. Hey I've got an Idea, you guys tell me what song I should learn and ill learn it. Ok thanks for reading.
