In fact to me his acting in "I am Sam" was one of the best performances I will ever see along with Mel Gibson in Braveheart. Those are actings that will stand against the test of time. Now back to Mystic River, this was a good movie but it reminded me of the same feelings I had after watching "Unforgiven". These movies gave me an empty feeling, like there was not enough interesting or captivating material in them to actually make them memorable. So everybody can watch it if they wish. It's a good movie but not a very striking one I guess.
