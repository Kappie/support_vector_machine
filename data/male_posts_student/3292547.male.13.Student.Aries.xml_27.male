If you have no clue what it is, it's a site with several hundred test all the way from  urlLink The Classic IQ Test ,  urlLink Tickle's Original Inkblot Test , and ' urlLink The Multiphasic Personality Inventory'  --to the fun test like--  urlLink Which "American Idol" Are You? ,  urlLink Are you Millionaire Material ,  urlLink Are you Evil? ,  urlLink What Type of Flirt Are You? , and  urlLink What Breed of Dog Are You?   For the more serious tests, or  urlLink Premium Tests , Tickle says that: Our PhD certified Premium Tests are based on the most current and accurate research available. Each offers thought-provoking test questions and personalized analyses that will encourage you to go after your goals and improve every relationship you have in your life - with friends, loved ones, even colleagues.  Wheter you believe that or not, it's still a fun place to go if you wnna find out if you have a Six Sense of not. Well, back to taking tests I go. If you want to know what it says about me on any of them, or if you just wanna show off and tell the world, just post your results as a comment. I haven't gotten one yet =-( and I'm still waiting.  *Watches clock*
