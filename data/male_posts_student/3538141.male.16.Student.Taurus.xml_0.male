If you are reading this, and find any of my posts interesting, feel free to e-mail me at samuel.wilkin@westminster.org.uk  I did Kung Fu today.  Master Lee was away so Old Jon took it... that was very funny.  We did mainly forms and traditional stuff - Martial Arts can be either Traditional or Modern, or both.  Traditional styles involve mainly forms and workign on low stance-work, whereas a more modern style will focus more on the competition sparring or practical self-defence.  We practise both sparring and forms at our club, but the feel of it is distinctly traditional.  Stance-work, however, is not just to look pretty - they strengthen not only the muscles in the legs, but internally strengthen the bones and joints, producing similar results to Thai boxers kicking trees, without the bone cancer most Thai boxers develop by the time they are 30.  I have heard stories of men in China who practise traditional Kung Fu not as a sport, but as a way of life.  You get 70-year old men who look 50, and 90-year olds who can still run around.  This if nothing else is a reason to practise Traditional Martial Arts, as I have seen the life of a 90-year old through the eyes of my grandmother, and it is not pleasant.  Even the great majority of middle aged people in this country are overweight.  I simply could not live with myself not being in good shape - for me it is essential for my concentration and general happiness.  Perhaps all that will change in a few years, but I hope not.  I intend to live every minute of my life to the full.  What a cliche!  But by that I do not mean clubbing, drinking and smoking, as most people who say that mean, for that is only living the first portion of your life to the full.  I intend to enjoy my early years while still knowing that I am in good shape and have a good outlook on the future, so that old age will be something to enjoy as much as my youth.
