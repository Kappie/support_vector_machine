Mandy and I know that we love each other like crazy, so we're going to stay in touch and still be loving towards each other and then one day, when the time is right... we will give it another go. She has been so lovely the past 24 hours and I'm not really sure why. She calls me all the time, saying that she misses me... it's really nice. Maybe it was a mistake breaking up with her. We will see.  I got my aquarium stuff the other day. I'm gonna tidy my room up tomorrow and then I'm gonna set the tank up. Hopefully, it will be running smoothly by Sunday, and I can go to the aquarium and get some tropical fish!  I just got back from a meal. It was my friends birthday, Laura. She invited me and some more of her friends along. It was kinda nice, but to be honest, Mandy was in my heart all night. I couldn't think of anything else. Plus, Laura was really down most of the night. I think it was her dad that caused it. He really is a twat. He had a go at me for speaking on the phone. He told me to go outside! What a knob-cheeeeeese. But yeah, it was a nice night really and there was another thunder storm! How cool! Better go...
