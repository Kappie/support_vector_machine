Then Tina took Tyke's Lit Book and wrote him a message in it and hid it for him in english.  He found it though.  Then Tyke talked to Purdy in english and she first said that she read this blog for the first time and then she started off by saying that he is obsessed with Tina.  Tyke is tired of hearing that though.  It gets kinda old after 4 years but it isn't Purdy's fault for thinking this.  Most people seem to.  Oh well, he is just Truly Madly Deeply (song on the cd he made tonight) in love with her.  Then Purdy said that he should confess his love to her but Dottie disagreed at lunch and so did Tyke.  Seeing as Tina and Kram are going out and that his confessing it would not gain him anything and would probably just make things more awkward or just different between them.  But Purdy later realized that this would probably be a bad idea to confess so she is on his side too.  It isn't that Tyke is scared to do so but he just feels it isn't right and that there is nothing to accomplish.  Not that there needs to be something accomplished through his confessing his love.  It should only be said to let Tina know how he feels about her.  It isn't like by telling her, she will magically fall in love with him.  This isn't a fairy tale.  Life doesn't work like the movies.  How much simpler would it be though?  I mean, good people wouldn't die unless they were being stupid and nice guys would get the girl after the girl realized her boyfriend was an ass and that the guy who has deep feelings for her is really the right guy.  But anyway, Tyke knows that he cannot change Tina and can only cherish the time they spend together and hope that they get to hang out more often.  ~*~
