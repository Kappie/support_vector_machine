I've spent a ridiculous amount of time with sarah over the last couple days, and our conversations are better than a non-responsive journal, frankly.  I'm so glad that we still have that bond where we can (and do) talk about everything that's going on.    The last couple nights (mornings?) we've been meeting on the bike trail and hanging out really late at night (early in the morning?).  We just wander and talk about stuff.  It's interesting.  I feel more honest late at night.  and our silences are never awkward.  it's odd.  Lexi (my brother's friend) is really cool.  I got some advice from her tonight, and I think she's right.  I should follow it.  anyway, I'm not really stressed, so I feel little need to say much else. -Mike  "Don't don't don't let's start, This is the worst part, to believe for all the world, that you are my precious little girl"
