After several days of who-knows-what (schoolwork, traveling, etc.) that keeps a person away from basic maintenance, I can take that extra hour to concentrate on the smaller details of life. Like folding some of that laundry I didn't get to finish. Maybe reading some of that already mail I picked up yesterday. Organizing my CD collection back into their cases. Emptying out my "To Be Filed" folder (when it's the biggest folder in the cabinet, time to start sorting). Normally I'm pretty neat (and tidy, too  ) so it's odd and somewhat disconcerting to see these three or four things out of place. I'm such a disappointment. Tisk tisk. Which reminds me, I've got some letters to send out!
