Property is a bundle of rights And I want to hold you in my bundle tonight I want a right to exclude Anybody else from seeing you in the nude  If I have to I'll adversely possess The shirt that you're wearing and your lovely new dress I want to use you exclusively I own you and you rent me   You're my property For all of perpetuity I'm putting a Restrictive Covenant On anybody else touching you  You're my property I'll sell you into slavery I own an Easement On every part of you   Your new boyfriend knew when he came to town That I had a covenant and I wrote it down Implied, reciprocal, and negatively I have a servitude so you belong to me  He says it's an unreasonable restraint But I am his lawyer and won't file that complaint He claims that you've been alienated But he does not have privity from when it was created   You're my property For all of perpetuity I'm putting a Restrictive Covenant On anybody else touching you  You're my property I'll sell you into slavery I own an Easement On every part of you   I have a simple fee Unless I sell you, you belong to me   You're my property For all of perpetuity I'm putting a Restrictive Covenant On anybody else touching you  You're my property I'll sell you into slavery I own an Easement On every part of you
