Instead, I found myself   becoming more alive in the shower, watching the concept of a nice,   peaceful nap slip down the drain.  Oh well,  I thought,  a peaceful shower's okay too.      I didn't get that either. My dad called me in the middle of my shower.   I begrudgingly turned the water off, wove a towel around my waist, and   answered the phone. As it turned out, my younger brother wasn't   registered for the summer daycare program today, and so the only way he   could get in would be if there were any cancelations. They were eading   home to wait for word of vacancies.     It wasn't even eight o' clock yet, and my day was looking like a bad one.     I schlepped back into the shower, thinking of all the things I  wouldn't      be able to do if my brother and dad stayed home all day. Finishing, I   dressed, spiked my hair, and took the five steps to my computer.     Within an hour, there was a cancelation, and so the two extra bodies in the house were out the door.     I had to go get music for my violin, so I hopped on my bike and headed   down the highway to the music shop. After purchasing the book, I   decided to take a long way home, and rode a loop back to my house.     The ride itself was enjoyable, and rather uneventful. No psychotic   maniacs running after me, throwing knives; no squirrels dashing under   my wheel. For the most of the ride, I contemplated the feeling of joy I   got yesterday after learning that the girl I've had a crush on for the   last six months also liked me. While it was a rather childish reason tobe overjoyed,   it's a rare one, and so I'm attempting to remember it before it fades.     By the time I was nearly three-fourths of the way home, my legs were aching like crazy, and my mouth was getting sticky from lack of moisture. I managed to pull myself home, opened the door, and made a beeline towards the fridge, where I poured and immediately downed a glass of cold, fresh water.   Upstairs, on my computer, I Mapquest'd my route, piece by piece, and found that it came to about 9.48 miles-- which I rounded to 10. I thought I had a good reason to be exhausted, seeing as I'd averaged about a pace of 10-15 mph.   I unceremoniously spent the rest of the day scheming a poster for my local highschool's mafia, and surfing the web. While my day had started off looking a bit unfriendly, it worked itself out by midafternoon.
