Bardot is just another uber-Leftists who moved to France and spends her time supporting causes like PETA, but she's in hot water again for speaking her mind.  For the fourth time, a court in France has fined her for saying something bad about Muslims.    Quote - “Mme. Bardot presents Muslims as barbaric and cruel invaders, responsible for terrorist acts and eager to dominate the French to the extent of wanting to exterminate them,” the court said."  Uh, yeah.  And what part of that isn't true?  Anyway, remember that France is a model nation of the Leftist cause.  They want us to be more like that.  I guess this Blog would earn me quite a bit of court time if that ever came to pass.
