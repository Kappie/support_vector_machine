       
       This is the end. This story's old But it goes on and on  Until we disappear. Calm me and let me taste The salt that you breathed While you were underneath. I am the one who haunts your dreams Of mountains sunk below the sea. I spoke the words but never Gave a thought to what they all could mean. I know that this is what you want. A funeral keeps both of us apart. You know that you are not alone. Need you like water in my lungs. This is the end.
