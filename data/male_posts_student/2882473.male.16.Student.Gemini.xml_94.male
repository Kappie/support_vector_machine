I took a trip into Bromley with mum this morning, for the main reason of getting me a new school bag, as the last one I had has now got a broken zip. Well, it was broken for ages, but decided to wait until the end of term to get a new one. And now I have one, the same model as  urlLink megatrobe's  but in different colours, for Â£15 from Lillywhites. And then we came home.  After finishing 'Reaper Man' yesterday, which was a very good book, I decided I must have something else to read. So I sallied forth to the local library to search for some pleasant reading material. I soon stumbled upon 'The Lord of the Rings', and after seeing each film at the cinema, renting the DVDs, and buying the DVD boxset, I decided to finally have a read of the book behind the film. 3 books, and I shall try to read them in 3 weeks (which is when they are due back) I never did like renewing books, always makes you look like a slow reader. Nothing wrong with that, of course, but... well... I'd like to finish in the time nonetheless. So, after a little reading today, I'm up to page 75, or half way through chapter 2. I don't stand a chance do I? 1500 pages... well, I may just make it. I am on holiday after all.  Which reminds me. I will be having a (hopefully) pleasant few days in Dorset with my family, starting on Tuesday. So there will likely be an absent of blogging during that short time. In the time I am gone, do not despair, my good readers. There are plenty of other good blogs out there (few as good as mine of course). Or you could take up reading and juggling. Though not at the same time...  Bye for now.   Weather:  Sunny, cloudy, overcast. A mixture really.  Reading:  The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring  Listening to:  Star Wars techno music (yep, very sad. I do know)  Watching:  Liar, Liar earlier. Naked Gun Later. Robin Hood, Men in Tights yesterday. Rather amusing I thought.  Confused about:  Nowt really  Annoyed with:  Nowt...  Mood:  Rather good
