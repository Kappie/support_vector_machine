(I hope I won't get sued for this :/ )  Global Positioning Satellites are so cool that they reinforce one's belief in God. If one chip can communicate with 3 satellites that are orbiting the earth to tell you where - within 18 inches - your teenage daughter is and how fast - within a tenth of a foot per hour - her boyfriend is coming on to her, then all this stuff about sparrows falling out of trees and God in heaven being aware of it is probably true. Certainly its technically possible. My idea of a killer franchise is a drive-through that staple-guns GPS chips into your toddlers, teenagers, aging parents, household pets, and car keys.  rotfl  Bleh ^^;;
