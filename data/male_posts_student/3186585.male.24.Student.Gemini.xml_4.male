His new flick  urlLink 'The Journey' , from all reports promises to be one of his best yet. I managed to grab a sneak preview of some of the film. The destinations, snow conditions, not to mention the inhuman tricks performed there are absolutely mind boggling. I had no idea people could do things like that on a board or pair of ski's?!! For anyone wanting to find inspiration, this is the film for you. Again I can attest to this as I have seen the last 3 Warren Miller films, and each gets better than the last. Needless to say I'm rubbing my hands in anticipation. See you all at the State Theatre later in June, then hopefully on the slopes!! Arivaderce
