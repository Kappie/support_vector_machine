Big surprise - they didn't carry a single item. That sucked, but since a couple of the items were for Blacky, we just went next door to PetSmart and got them there. One of the things Patti bought was a new ID tag for Blacky with his new address. :)  After that, we headed to Lowe's and just went crazy. We're finally getting around to working on the master bathroom and wanted to buy all new stuff for it. That includes lighting fixtures, accessories, and paint. Not only did we get that stuff, we also bought a ton of other stuff for some other household projects and after purchasing the items, realized how poor we really are. LOL. :) Damn houses are expensive!  After that, we did a bunch of shopping for groceries at CostCo. I pointed out to Patti that we had reached our monthly grocery budget and could no longer buy food for the rest of August. We'll just have to starve. Damn food is expensive!  The good thing is that we are keeping good records of our purchases and staying within our budget (as best we can). Since this is the first month of budgeting and record keeping, I think its going along nicely. I've created some useful Excel spreadsheets to aid in the process. I strongly recommend doing that for anyone keeping a budget.  NEwayz, the house is coming along nicely and we look forward to getting it "done".
