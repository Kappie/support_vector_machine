Ha ha ha ha, I beat Kyle and tied with Dan in a game of 21.  OWNAGE.  But I'm not good enough at B-Ball to do much else than casual playing.  I need a new game, and I need a new graphics card.  When I look around wherever I am surrounded by people, it seems like I am the only normal, happy, uncomplicated, smart, person there. There are always people talking about pointless things (he said she said) and depressing things("oh my god, my life is so shitty"), people talking shit to each other("well, that guys a fag and she's a slut").  And then there's me.  The guy that has a decent look on life, looking down on those poor fools.  Now this may seem like I have an inflated ego; but no.  Its called a good attitude.  Compared with your anxieties, it really is quite fun.  And listening to all your whining is funny.  I really can't stress enough about sucking it up and being cool.  Not enough people do it.  "Oh, but Wes, you're doing it now!  You're making fun of us!"  Well, then that's because I am in a position to do so.  Maybe if you suck it up, stop complaining, and make a crack at me, then you'll be happy.  I'll probably be happy for you to.  You fucking lamer.  My plan for sadsacks to have a decent look on life: 1. Stop whining.  If you stop whining, people like me won't avoid you and your stupid shit like the plague.  And if you hang around people that think being sad a lot is fine, then you got some weird friends. 2. Stop being so goddamned mopey if life tosses you a bad turn.   3. Suck it up.  There's a silver lining in that cloud. 4. Be nice to other people.  I'm fucking serious here.  I may seem self-centered, but I'm a good person.  I volunteer.  I do all my work.  I am polite in public situations. 5. Don't be afraid to do more than you're asked.    Follow those steps and you'll be happy.
