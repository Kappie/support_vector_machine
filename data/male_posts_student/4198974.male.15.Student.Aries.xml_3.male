Ok, it all started when I lost that little slip of paper with my locker combination on it. I searched for it but couldn't find it. So I went back to the locker checkout bitches and asked if I could get a new lock to put on that same locker (since someone probably picked up my combo on the floor and could get into my locker). She said that I would have to move lockers and couldn't stay in the same one. I told her that I had my lock from last year and could have my mom bring that one to use in the same locker. The lady at the end of the table heard and she got pissed, "You still have your lock from last year? You can't get a locker until you bring the other one back. *lady I was talking to's name* make sure you DON'T let him check out another lock until he brings that one from last year back."  PoopyStinks36324 (8:56:22 PM): after that PoopyStinks36324 (8:56:29 PM): i had to call my mom to have her bring my lock PoopyStinks36324 (8:57:00 PM): and i said on the phone (the bitch didn't hear me but the other checkout lady did) "mom there's this bitch here who i think is PMSing, and i need my lock" PoopyStinks36324 (8:57:23 PM): then the bitch goes PoopyStinks36324 (8:57:37 PM): i just told the executive secratary to get an administrator and we can talk about this PoopyStinks36324 (8:57:47 PM): i start walking away to go outside to wait for my momPoopyStinks36324 (8:57:51 PM): and she goes "come back here" PoopyStinks36324 (8:58:11 PM): "i'd love to stay and chat, but unforutionally i have to go outside and wait for my mom" (*in a very sarcastic and rude voice) PoopyStinks36324 (8:58:27 PM): and i walk away while she keeps yelling at me to come back PoopyStinks36324 (8:58:34 PM): so my mom comes, brings the locks and i walk back in PoopyStinks36324 (8:58:43 PM): and as soon as i enter the bayou area PoopyStinks36324 (8:58:54 PM): i yell REALLY loud "HEY LADY! I GOT YOUR LOCKS!!" PoopyStinks36324 (8:59:28 PM): then she found some paper that said "if you dont return the locks you must pay a fine" PoopyStinks36324 (8:59:32 PM): which makes no sense PoopyStinks36324 (8:59:35 PM): because when u turnned them in PoopyStinks36324 (8:59:40 PM): they gave you 2 dollars back right? PoopyStinks36324 (8:59:44 PM): that shows that the locks were worth somthing PoopyStinks36324 (8:59:56 PM): but she said that the 5 bucks was for renting the locker PoopyStinks36324 (9:00:08 PM): and i was like "well then why do they give you money back when you return the locks?" PoopyStinks36324 (9:01:04 PM): if they give you money back for returing the locks PoopyStinks36324 (9:01:11 PM): that shows that it is worth somtehing correct? PoopyStinks36324 (9:01:22 PM): since i didn't want my 2 bucks back PoopyStinks36324 (9:01:29 PM): they can keep it and use it to buy a new lcok PoopyStinks36324 (9:02:13 PM): but i enjoyed it PoopyStinks36324 (9:02:16 PM): stupid whore
