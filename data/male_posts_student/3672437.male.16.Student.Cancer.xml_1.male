This counter is split up into sections for pistols, single round rifles, automatic rifles, single shot spread, pump action, alternative weapons, pepper spray, ect.   Its kinda scary though when they have a video that is on a continuous loop that has things on it like the proper way to enter a room with certain types of weapons, the best weapon for defending your home, which weapon is suitable around children for defence, what to do if your partner (wife) is scared of having a gun in the house, and that pepper spray is only to be used as a deterant on dogs ro as a distraction as you pull out a bigger gun than your attacker has got pointed at you .  It seems silly to me to sell guns to people and then sell more guns to people to protect themselfs from the people who just bought guns but thats America for you.
