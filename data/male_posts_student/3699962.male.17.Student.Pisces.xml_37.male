Haha.  I'm officially done with Racial Harmony day.  Oh wait. I still have an evaluation to do. Darn.  I'm lagging behind so much in my studies it ain't funny.  All my A level subs 'cept lit. Sigh.  I'm hovering between going back to God,  and being deterred from ever going back.  Good or bad? I have no clue.  I'm emceeing for Guitar Night and its tomorrow night!  I'm officially Mr. Morning Announcements.  Thank God they're doing something about it.  I'm running Recollections for the National Day Concert.  Way to go Sherman. Sticking your nose into so much stuff.  Your studies might just be affected. Your health is suffering.  (I make it sound like I've got some terminal illness don't I?)  Heck your faith is wavering. Get a grip!  I'm working on it!    jesusi believe in you, jesusi belong to you, you're the reason thati live, the reason thati sing, with all i am...        i love you, all of my hope is in you, jesus christ, take my life, take all of me...    I really wanna sing those two choruses with all I am. But I really feel I can't. I'm working on it! God... help!
