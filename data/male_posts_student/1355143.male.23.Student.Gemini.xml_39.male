Another week on, another week wiser, and guess what I learnt to do this week?  What I hear you ask, come on Adam tell us!  Snowboarding I say!  Yes, I went snowboarding this weekend (the title may have given this away!), for the first time and quite possibly the last!  We were not amazingly well prepared for it, three hours sleep after an outing with mainly CEMS peeps on Friday (an introduction to Mas i Mas, which for some reason didnt go down to well, worrying huh?!?) left me and Steffen short of energy and the three hour train jouney up to La Mollina was hardly comfortable, crammed together on the floor like refugees was less than cosy!  Anywayz, via a bus connection we finally got to the resort which was gorgeous and I was bullied into goin snowboarding as otherwise I would be the odd one out :o(  so I collapsed and allowed myself to be punished for that stupid, stupid decision for the next 4 hours!  Steffen has some great photos of me flat on my face which I am sure you will all enjoy and I will try and get him to put them up on the website.  Talking about photos and websites I have put all the ones I have taken in the last couple of weeks and they are now sitting pretty on Walker's website ready for you guys so that you can see what the new folk look like and double check that I look as good as I did ;op  Snowboarding was actually quite good fun, by the end of the day I could even pick up some speed and turn and shit, though this inevitably just meant that the falls were harder and hurt a lot more!  A seat on the ride home did my bruised behind no end of help and brunch at La Fianna yesterday and a couple of pints in an Irish pub (spoke to Noel, Tim) completed the recovery process.  Apart from that the last week has been fairly quiet, more exchange students have arrived and I think everyone is here now, I still have a five day weekend so lots of time to do nothing really!  Shame about all you guys who have work to do, ha ha!  Sun is shining and all I can say is, bring it on!  Hasta luego tios y tias,  A
