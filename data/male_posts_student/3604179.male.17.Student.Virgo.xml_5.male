Weare coming back, WATCH OUT HIGHLAND RED. It's about time that both teams win though, our one win before this, the red team lost the same night. A great night for the teams. We have to face each other next week. The red team is superior, but if we can hit like last week, we'll win. I'm not expecting to win, but it'll be a fun game either way. I'm going to have fun watching the Family guy dvd right now, YEA!!!!! I'm a little happier tonight. JUSTIN "WE FINALLY TOOK IT TO EM'" HURLEY
