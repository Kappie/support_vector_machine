Today is a day to remember that one individuals love can drive them to dramatic actions.  Justin, I am sorry I failed you as a lover.  I am sorry you saw the world as unlivable.  I am truly sorry your grave will be unattended by me this year.    But today is also a day of jubilation and success on love’s front. On April 24th, a mere 47 days away, Riley Hays is going to Junior Prom with me, A.K.A Fabi.  Riley truly is an amazing boi.  Riley’s heart is one of gold.  He is a character that doesn’t judge or condemn or look down upon anyone.  Mrhahahah!  He is neat and shiny! And he is funny as frickin’ sin.  And some weird shit happened last night.  It all started with our ‘Good Byes’ two days ago: Fabi: Paint a picture of my face upon your pillow...and I shall of you...and we shall communicate with our pillows ...in hopes that we may see each other in our dreams tonite. I'll astral project my ass. lol.   Disco: Lol, I am sure we will, until tomorrow So then the creepy shit, I think is was the cool ass shit, like spiritual stuff.  Fate, signs?  Yall tell me!  Fabi: When I went to bed last night, there was some point when I felt feverish and rolled over.. and when I did..I saw your face on my pillow ...like, it was for a brief ten seconds.. well, actually I shook...like, my whole body shook because it was so miraculous. ...but I totally saw you.  Disco: I woke up and I have fuck me hair well I jumped out of bed at two in the morning and went to the bathroom to piss and I splashed water on my face and you were in my mirror,  no shitting, so like I grabbed my notebook and in the red nightlight glow I scratched out a poem FREAKY.  It is cool as Hell! Beatachh, this relationship is frickin’ awesome.com! Fabi is corny as sin, but hell so am I!  Fabi: Like, the universe just pointed its proverbial finger at us and said "Hey comet and asteroid, meet and mate?" Lol, well enough of that more will come later!   	 I don't know why people are so reluctant to really do something to change their lives. Of the people I have to talk to at school, they keep complaining that everything is hard and life is tough. But what are they doing to change that? Just keep coming back to school and basically take in all the crap they can for the day. But why do they do that anyway? It is pointless to complain. Americans are known to do that. Just a bunch of whiners! People should just grow up and learn to overcome adversities. Instead of waiting for what the government has to say about something. Nowadays, I'd like to think that I come onto school fully charged with positivist. I dismiss any negative things I say as bad habit. A bad habit that I need to kick really bad. Whining and complaining never does anything good, really. Why because all they do is prolong the feeling of dread.  But sharp tongue is allowed for asinine individuals.   One of the best thing I ever decided to do lately is put down what I think and feel to a medium such as this. Sure, people can come and visit my blog and have an opinion of their own. But tell me who doesn't? The truth is everyone has their own opinion on what something is. It is up to us to sift through everything and take in what’s realty useful and important. And of course, some level of tact is involved.  I have definitely discovered the joy of listening to other people talk. Hear what they have to say about something. Of course bad breathe not included. No matter how good and informative the conversation is, there is simply no good excuse for bad breathes. That includes BAD RANCID BREATHE.  I used to think that there was something to prove to somebody else about how much I have changed. I just wish the next schoolmate who meets me does not dismiss me. No one likes to be dismissed. Everyone wants to feel needed and noticed. To be recognized. I used to bear too much thought about what people used to know me as. I can never fully change. What I was before is still inside me. I never try too hard not to screw up because the more I try so hard, the more I tend to mess up. So I just take my time and look where I am going.  Recently I had to battle a comment made against me. It was the comment made about the quality of work. I admit upfront and rather not proudly that I tend to mess up at school. I was told that in the U.S. that if you screw up too much, you'd get punished.  And I used to let that get to me. I mean, REALLY get to me. Then I found out that ANY excuse that I made about myself pertaining to work was just playing down my situation. I think that on several occasions, if I did not seem to feel so sorry about screwing up something, I would have actually been out on my ass without a job.  But now. I REALLY take time to look at what I am doing. I still mess up. But not too bad. Maybe I have lost the respect of my Advisors. Even my officers and counselors But I survived. And I have learnt to move on.  Being positive about the outlook of my own life is just the tip of the iceberg. One has to really open up their eyes and take responsibility of their own lives to truly know the meaning of living. Of course you can take it easy and enjoy your life. But what use is that if you are completely broke?  Living is Winsconsin as a local gay man; the height is set too high. So much is expected of us. But not all of us can step up and meet the measurement. And I suggest no one try to compete against a striaght man. Comparing the 2 is simply unfair. Anyway, why do you have to feel the need to defend your own honor against that kind of prejudice? So she has a woman lover? Who gives cow? But that's the whole point. Some of these people seem to make it as if it does matter. That the straight man is the answer. The fault, if there is any, is not on the straight. Of course, don't take this as a generalized statement. I don't mean everyone of course. Think about it.
