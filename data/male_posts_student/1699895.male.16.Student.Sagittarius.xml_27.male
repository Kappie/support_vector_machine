Detroit Rock City is one of the funniest movies, rent it or sumthin...  ahhh, 4 1/2 day weekend is good, but there isn't quite anything to do, so I'm probobly just going to end up sleeping, or going to drews house, or maybe even catchin a flick   urlLink FunnyJunk.Com  , yet another humorus site that never ceased to dissapoint me.  also NOT doing jazz band, I hate doing things that envolve the school >.  Davy-Boys team went to states, and there going to be playing in Grand Rapids. Unfortunatly, I won't be going to the games (REALLY!?) cause its so freakin far away.  I have an overdue book in almost every library of michigan  out and gone
