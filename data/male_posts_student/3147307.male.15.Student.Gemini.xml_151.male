Some of it seems a little far-fetched (cars are always spotless, stuff like that). I'd give it *** out of 4. Everyone in the movie is a bad guy (they are all criminals), but you still like the "good" bad guys. Charlize Theron stars in the movie (she won best actress for Monster). On another note, we had Bible Bowl prep on Sunday and I really haven't studied that much. But i'm rededicating myself to studying. I already studied 1 hr, 45 mins today. I can't lose to the girls team. I also can't lose to my brothers. I don't care much if I get beat by a team that is obviously smarter than our group, but I am going to try my hardest to win it for our team.
