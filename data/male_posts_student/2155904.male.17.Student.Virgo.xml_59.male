But Tyke came through it doing just fiiiine.  3rd period was fun despite the Libertarian party guy coming in and speaking and doing just a horrible job.  Amed would have done much much better just going up there and talking for like 5 minutes about what the class really needed to know.  Tyke, Purdy, and Haras talked about his blog from last night and how awesome it was.  And also about what they like in his blog.  Hence the reason that he is even mentioning the fact that they talked about since it really isn't that newsworthy to most of you.  But of course everyone loves to get mentioned in Tyke's blog, including Tyke himself.  He always loves going back and reading about all the times he mentions Tyke's name.  (*whispers "don't tell anyone but Tyke actually only skims the prose to find his own name in the text...hehehehehehe...sooo badd ass")  But really it is just fun to have mentionings in this blog.  Wink wink (don't worry no tickling this time...tickle day is Thursday even though Tyke actually does remember getting tickled by Dottie in 4th period).  Speaking of Dottie she said that it is hard for her to read this sometimes cuz of all the names.  Tyke has taken this into consideration and at some soon point he is going to venture into making a list of all the names and their true counterparts.  It will take a while to do which is why Tyke is sorta postponing this weighty task until the preponderance of the moment is past (btw that was a total misusage of preponderance but Tyke needed to fit that in somewhere so here it got "sticked" in).  The school day progressed and ended up ending after 6th period.  In 6th period though Tyke made up some great songs such as the Student Force Sensor song.  Additionally, he got into a raucous ruckus with Purdy over the correct singing of the Captain Planet theme song.  It was the part where he takes pollution down to zero.  Tyke grew up singing it one way and he has seemingly been proven wrong and he totally accepts defeat but oh if he finds out he was right.  There are gonna be some arses getting rammed.  Eh, not so much actually.  Cuz really it was mostly guys that were saying Tyke was wrong and he really isn't into arse-ramming anyway.  But for now he accepts total defeat and he demotes himself from being the Fire guy to the gay Heart guy who always is playing with his monkey.  The animal, that is (ooo Tyke is so dirrty tonight).  Singing is awesome.  He just remembered he was singing a lot in 4th period with Purdy and Dottie.  That was awesome.  You are my sunshine.  My only sunshine.  When you're not happy, my skies are gray.  You'll never know dear how much I love you.  Please don't take my sunshine away.  Any problems with the lyrics that Tyke has there???  Go ahead and correct them should anyone have a propensity to say so.  It seems like people like to disprove Tyke.  And when he says disprove he means SHOVE IT IN HIS FACE AND MAKE IT COME OUT HIS RIGHT BIG TOE!  But then again he does act like he is real smart and a total egghead (his mom used to work at Egghead also).  This is a lengthy blog.  But a fun one to write.  Ok, he needs to get to the after school part.  Well he came home with Amed, Fejj (jewish fejj), and Tyronius.  They played some PS2 and then all but Tyron went to play bball up by Tyke's house.  It was fun especially since Tyke won both games of 21 and P-I-G.  Then they split and Tyke had BK for dinner.  It was g-o-o-D.  Everyone was at the bball game of course.  And Haras was cheering of course.  Another awesome performance turned in by the Indian Princess.  But the great crew was there.  Especially the Maniak as he and Tyke were taunting and jeering and cheering and doing whatever it took to get those "Eagles" a 3OT victory.  After the game the congratulations were given around the stands as Tyke was given MVP by Principal Mikey G.  Eh, that was stupid.  Not funny.  Can't be funny when you try to be.  That is like an oxymoron-trying to be funny.  Just ain't gonnas works.  OK, no more sidetracking.  Kinker, Maniak, DUI, Macaroon, Dudely, Karla, Fejj, Amed, Kcaj, and Tyke all went to IVE to play bball under the lights.  It was wicked fun.  Tyke used his special move on Macaroon several times in order to get by him.  The old Nip-Slip and slip by move.  Works like a charm.  A lucky charm.  Stuck to a rabbit's foot.  Dipped in caramel.  Ah crap.  Tyke is thinking now that nobody took his ball with them as they left the court.  Which would mean right now a decent basketball is just sitting at a freaking elementary school court unsupervised in the cold with no pants on.  If it doesn't get frostbite it is definitely gonna get YOINKED.  Shiiiiit...yoink city man.  Well that is hardcore sucky.  Cuz it was his only decent ball now since all his other balls have holes in them so they don't function properly meaning he can't have a good time.  Tyke just realized that he has been writing this blog for at least half an hour.  That definitely means it is time to stop.  Earth, Wind, Fire, Water, Heart, with our powers combined...damn my ball got stolen...CAPTAIN PLANET SAVE ME!!!
