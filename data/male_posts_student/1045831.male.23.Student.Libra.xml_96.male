I always dread formal because, as those of you who know me know, I hate dressing up.  Not only do I hate dressing up but if I'm not guaranteed to hook up with my date I'm uncomfortable with that.  I mean come one, you take me, tons of booze and then a hot girl in my bed, things could end awkwardly.  But luckily I have always had good experiences with formals so my fears are generally unfounded. Last year I took Claudia who I was very comfortable around and we had fun and things went very well.  The year before that I took Elizabeth Baddely and things went well also.  This year though posed a different situation. I took my friend Kellie from USC.  We're friends and I'm very comfortable with her but there was going to be no hooking up which is scary because the girl is gorgeous and I'm not always the most gentlemanly human being after about 15-20 drinks.  Especially this year we had open bar with all top shelf liquor being included.  I think this was my saving grace.  This and the fact that I was aware of my weaknesses. I went and picked Kellie up from her house around seven and we drove down to the Westin in my moms convertible.  We talked about music and just random stuff.  It was a beautiful day and the drive was very enjoyable, surprisingly so for a drive in the car. We then got there and went up to the room.  Talked to Paul and Maroon about where to eat.  We decided on some Italian joint real near the hotel in Crown Center because it was easy and time saving. After dinner Paul and I and our dates went to go grab some beer at the liquor store and then on to the party.  The party was at Union Station and was awesome.  Free Booze makes almost anything great and this would have been cool anyway.  It was real chill and we hung out and drank and got pretty liquored.  Then it was time to go so me and Kellie started walking home when she decided she wanted to go play in the fountains.  I was ok with that so we went down one of the stairwells to the street.  We had ended up going to the wrong door and couldn't get back in because the door locked behind him. After that things get pretty vague and fuzzy from inebriation but we ended up not making it to the fountains and I remember climbing over some wall.  But we got home and then I had part of a beer and past out. A good time.  The next day I drove Kellie home and went home to take a nap and hang with my sister.   Well that was a long series of events but I still have a little more to say but I'll save that for another time.
