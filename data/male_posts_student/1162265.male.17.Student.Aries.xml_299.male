It was soo long and drawn out though, with me and all the other counselors over 17 (me and this girl I don't really know from school were the only people who were actually 17).  It was still pretty cool, I got to bond with alot of people I wouldn't usually talk to.  It seems like Monday is going to be some good stuff, hopefully.  Anything else?....  Fox has me watching it again.  The Simple Life 2, is definitely a guilty pleasure.  Besides, Nicole (who is bi-racial) looks like my Cousin Sara.  I'll find a good picture of just Sara sometime, and post it and then one of Nicole.  It's kinda eerie.    Then Method and Red, I really like that show.  It makes fun of it's own black ignorance by making it insanely opulent.  They had a champagne cooler (like a water cooler) with disposable cups (which were really goblets spackled with rubies).  And they have an obsession with Asian women, that's funny too.  And Method man's mom lives in the house with them.  It's really a much better show then I thought it'd be.  It's already had two episodes, and a third one is planned for next week.  It might have staying power.
