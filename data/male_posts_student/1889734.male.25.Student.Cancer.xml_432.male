Today they blast Bush over his Guard Service, blithely ignoring the facts contained in the payroll records to perpetuate the questions, and hoping that the rumors will stick.  'If President Bush thought that his release of selected payroll and service records would quell the growing controversy over whether he ducked some of his required service in the Air National Guard three decades ago, he is clearly mistaken. '  He's mistaken because the Times won't let this one die.  'Whether Mr. Bush actually performed his Guard service to the full is a different matter. It bears on presidential character because the president has continually rejected claims that there was anything amiss about his Guard performance during the Alabama period.'  Presidential Character?!  The Times had no problems with Clinton's little lapse of character.  We had evidence to prove he lied.  And now we have evidence to prove that Bush served honrably.  But don't let that get in the way of an agenda.  Steve, have you found your 'reasoned' Democrat yet?  I think it's time you make a conclusion and move on.
