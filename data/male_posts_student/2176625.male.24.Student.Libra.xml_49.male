Waiting for her to have this baby is torture on my mom because they moved in with her so they can save money for a larger place. She has to buy food 2x weekly.   Shailani and Forley's wedding is Saturday. My girl Shailani is getting married! I'm going to the wedding stag because I can't find a "date".
