I see people around me having deep, meaningful relationships. I see friends breaking up with people they love and cherish because they aren't ready for a relationship. I see people get married. My sister just had a friggn kid, and I can only imagine the amount of love and commitment that requires . And I'm the sixteen year old nerd who has still yet too kissed a girl yet.     I don't know, maybe there's a plan, and maybe were all just kidding ourselves. Whither or not the world makes sense or it is a series of random hormonal imbalances and messed up synapses will always be a mystery. If I have some where I can feel I'm going, someplace I can feel in my soul  needs  to go, then why the hell am I so lazy? Sometimes I want to shoot myself because I know I have all this uncontrollable drive and ambition, which could be used for amazing things, but ill never get off my ass and actually  do  anything about it.    On a lighter note, if anyone who is available reads this I am in search of Players to round out my funk band, WTF: White Trash Funk. I currently need another Trumpet player, Two Trombone players, a Bassist that can play slap, a keyboard player, and a Tenor Saxophone. Anyone whose interested just aim me, and well talk about it.  Here is something I wrote at the beginning of the year:   A brave new World   A Small path  leads to a smaller door Within, a cold floor with pews of wood and stone.  The hole filters rays and through the glass they fall rise above the dwey mist  to meet my gaze.  A dead god, with hallow eyes, yet a living world full of love and lies.  Gone are fen and fell from mortal eyes lost to technology  and modern times.  On the path,  a coin lay forgotten. Men pass, Time fades, and thus it is forsaken.
