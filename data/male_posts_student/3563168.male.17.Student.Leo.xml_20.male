Last night, he had Lindsay Lohan, probably the stupidest teenage star since all the other teenagers that have become stars and then ended up becoming drunks 10 years down the road.  Thank god that the Lakers-Pistons game went into an exciting overtime, or I might have just ended up going to bed at 11 last night, seeing as how I'm very uncreative when it comes to engaging in activity.  Back to my point, teenage celebrities shouldn't exist. One, they're too damn stupid and horny to know anything. Two, they aren't even adults, making their earnings mostly stolen by their parents. Three, they can't act. When was the last time a teenager got an Oscar for their performance?     Look at that, I showed her by putting a red X on her face. Now she'll think twice before making stupid movies.  The thing that probably pisses me off the most about her is the fact that she's so fake. She has this terrible tan. Here's a rule of life:  red heads shouldn't be tan, otherwise they'll look bad. I swear, when I look at her it's like seeing carrot-zila coming to attack.  In conclusion, don't look up to Lindsay Lohan. Why? Well because she's a jerk-face and I decided to write about her in my random boredom.
