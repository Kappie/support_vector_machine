But I've found that for the most part my friends who have graduated don't want to hang out with sophomores and juniors as much.  Sorry if I offended you.   I know you said no more people, but I'd really like to invite Tyler to join.  He's going to being going to Indiana Academy next year and we won't see much of him.  Plus Pyler is incomplete without Taul.  He probably wouldn't post much anyway.  Just to consider.  Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.
