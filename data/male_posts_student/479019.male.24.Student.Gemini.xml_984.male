I better get some eye candy or big tips to compensate for the pain and suffering.  Last night I watched Spinal Tap with the girls. It was an entertaining movie, but I think somewhat over hyped.  I have a love / hate relationship with the guilty feeling you get, when you skip a day of working out.   I feel like sitting around drinking beer and painting today. However, I've got to go to work, and we'll probably be doing something for Derek's b-day later.  That's what's going on generally right now. Life is content, but being content makes my edgy... I get bored of it. There's a very self-destructive part of me that thinks I should be doing stupid things like saying things I shouldn't to people, abusing my body via jumping from high places and drinking.  I wanna say one last thing on the Casualities at Warped... what the fuck was up with changing the lyrics of Sham 69's "If The Kids Are United" to "If The Punks Are United"? That's such a load of bullshit. The change in lyrics reflects the mentality of many (not all) of their fans of musical, scene, image elitism. Instead of covering the wider demographic of "the kids" being united so they can't be divided, as in the original Sham 69 song... it's now "the punks" whoever the fuck the punks are. It's niche and branding.   Hah I wonder if Crystal is going to comment on this post.  ***
