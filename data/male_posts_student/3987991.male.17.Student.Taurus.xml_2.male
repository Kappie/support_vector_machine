Last night I had a dream that I was hanging out with Crystal and Naomi but they were acting like they didn't want me around them. I haven't seen them since early 2003.  I wrote a new Haiku and Tanka last night. Both of them have the same title. A Haiku's syllables go 5-7-5. A Tanka's syllables go 5-7-5-7-7.   Illusions  (Haiku)  Illusions are fake Reality is for real Find it within you.    Illusions  (Tanka)  Illusions are fake Reality is for real Find it within you. To others it is not real But they are all part of it.
