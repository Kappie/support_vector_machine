We were a single point shy of getting third place, and that was only because of a one point penalty we received due to our castle backdrop staying on the field too long. Despite the penalty and a fifth place finish we still beat Villa Park! The bus ride home was interesting to say the least (Sorry Ryan, were assholes, but you gotta love us.) and Fridays was fun. I didn't get home till 2 in the morning, and it was sure as hell worth it. I went driving with my mother today, possibly one of the single most annoying and disgusting things in the world, and discovered that as of yet I wasn't going to Phantom. She said that she hadn't known that I wanted to go so she just paid for my brother and father. I'm kind of pissed off about it, but she said that she'll pay for the ticket if Mike can get them.  I took the PSATs on Saturday. It was eerily easier then I thought it would be. I'm a bit scared because I may be overconfident and I might have boomed it big time. *Shrug* In the end its just another thing to appease the endless machine that is our neo-imperialist, faux-compassionate capitalist society. Lol , and my parents too.   There and Back again   I have a need to leave my home, and see the mines of god. Experience both the switch and rod. If golden realm has drawn me off much farther than I've been then ill turn around  there and come back again.
