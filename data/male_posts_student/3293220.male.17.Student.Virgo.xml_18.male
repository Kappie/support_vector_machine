It has been altered from the original text to protect the identities of any specific third-parties, and any alterations (**a)/deletions (**d) are denoted by the given asterisks. Enjoy.  Just a few months ago, I was sitting in an ostensibly relaxed hour inscribing demotic English concerning the person opposite me into the desk. While I write this, my don is in a court being accused of crimes. Surprised?  I was. This lack of two vital teachers has impeded the school and affected every one of us. People with GCSE, AS and A level exams have been forced to share classes with 30 people in a class. Pupils have been forced to sit on the floor in classes, with important exams looming. (**d) Despite all the school provides in terms of an education it doesn’t seem too capable of communicating itself with the students or the parents. The students didn’t get recognised as important enough to be informed. There was not even a letter home to parents explaining and apologising the circumstances. This is detrimental to the relationship between the school and its pupils, impressing upon them that people in power are always going to lie to them. This lack of communication gives rise to the ever-forthcoming rumours, which the school’s governing body is so perturbed by. When the mirror prints an article suggesting that two dons have been suspended for offences related to “child porn” and then mentions that this is absolutely untrue halfway through the article in two small lines, it becomes a matter of speculation regarding who is leaking these stories? A well-informed don or housemaster is unlikely to have done. A resentful and slightly spiteful student may feel it his duty to release the news to the world, which he either believes is the truth, or that would galvanise an investigation pertaining to the previously suppressed information. These rumours have put a dark mark onto these unfortunate dons. As always the rumours are bound to be worse than the truth itself. So why isn’t a shadow of the truth told to us in order to suppress rumours? When dons are confronted with these rumours, some shy away, some deny any knowledge at all.  Is this true? Are the dons as ignorant as us in this matter? If so there is something very wrong with the hierarchy of this school, so that the friends and colleagues of these men cannot be told. With the emptying of the don’s house (**d), it became clear that the matter had become more serious.  Would you empty your house if you were coming back? With a don (**a) successfully cleared of charges, the school is now in danger of being sued by him. This has made the school very weary of legal affairs. The school understandably doesn’t want to be involved in more legal affairs, so they have decided to not divulge any information to anyone. This is much too drastic a precaution. Admittedly, it is wise for them not to tell the pupils the details, but no information has been given at all. Us men in the school don’t want, or need, the gory ins-and-outs of the affair, but we do want some explanation as to why our exam results are under jeopardy and what is going on in our school.  OK, before you comment, try not to be silly and ask who the dons in question are, and for any further specific details. To us, the reputations of the respective dons are more important than any perceived desire to shake the school's foundations, as it were.
