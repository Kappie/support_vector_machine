My mother always gets pissed at my living in darkness, and she always says something about darkness making her depressed. As if she needs anything at all to make herself depressed... But anyway my thinking today revealed to me why I always had these vampire like instincts, living in the dark and at one point biting others.  You see I've always wanted to die, like in my previous post. Just get myself away from this horrid and cruel world. But then, after I pass from this world, where will I go? In the Bible, we will supposedly go to heaven, a place of joy. We will be there for the rest of time. Just imagine yourself feeling nothing but happiness forever. Knowing that this will never end. Looking at it like that Heaven may not be too desirable after all. And I won't even need to talk about hell.  Now for the vampire part. You see vampires will never leave this world. They just live and live and continue living on in this world. The only difference from heaven is that these vampires live in a changing world. A world with emotion other than joy. A world that is free for you to explore. A world that you know, and if you don't, will grow to know. Vampires live in a world where they are free to do whatever they want, without facing consequences. Of course there's the downside of having to take lives.  By belief, vampires are servants of Satan. If only I could be a vampire not under the control of Satan, not under the control of God. If only I could be the master of my life, my free and everlasting life...
