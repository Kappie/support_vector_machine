I do have an announcement to make however: I went to the MVA today, and... I GOT MY LEARNER'S PERMIT TODAY! I ALSO REGISTERED TO VOTE! I am officially a registered Republican. I think I'm about as conservative as they come without being part of the Christian Coalition, ML! I took the computer test at the MVA and passed the learner's test well! I get to take driver's ed and then my license in 4 months! I'm psyched! Anyway, that's all. So what's going on in your lives? Blog ya later!  In Christ, Mike  "Jesus is Life!" -SCC
