I had a nice nap in the car and a fun stop though, those sure helped the trip.  when i got home i talked to ben and bry today, bryndan worries me sometimes, actually alot of times (just be careful and dont do stupid things if u read this).  i also went to my neice danielles swimmeet today, she lost poor thing, and she doesnt like loosing so she hypervenilated and cried.  no fun at all :(  lets see ohh and tonight i talked to matt. yay! ok ne way im gonna go get some early sleep, i have doctors and car checkups to galore for tomorrow.  good night my friends, i hope the summer is treating you well!
