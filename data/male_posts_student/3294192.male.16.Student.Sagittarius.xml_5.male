If not, you've still done me a favor. I promise a 24-hour turn around time!  Music is really good at surprising me. Whenever I think I've heard every dimension that music can be in, and everything in between, I'm able to find something new I could never have imagined. Just go to a record shop and put on the big ugly headphones that they've got hanging around. Now listen to an album you've never heard of. I bet a million dollars you'd never come up with that shit. Stuff like that convinces me the world exists outside my head.  It also convinces me that there must be so much music out there that hasn't and won't be made, ever. I bet a lot of it is really good too. Most musical explorers, or 'musicians', try to find this stuff by saying to themselves "I'm going to write a new song! I'll play music until it sounds good and is not obviously a copyright violation!". I do that too, but what I actually wish I could do is dive into that murky sea of ghost music. I bet ghost music isn't so scary.  Journals about music, and an authors love of music, get really lame, because there is no easy and legal way of sharing tunes over the virtranet for all to hear. Maybe someday you'll understand what I mean when I say "I felt like the keyboard solo in 'The Imposter' by  urlLink Elvis Costello ." Or maybe you do already, and if you're one of those lucky people, drop me a comment. I'll feel less like and indie-elitist and more like a friend.  'Cuz I'm hard like that!
