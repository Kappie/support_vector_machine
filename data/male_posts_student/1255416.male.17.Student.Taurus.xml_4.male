Easy day at school, I hate Ms. Riley with an all-consuming passion, but at least i wasn't working with complete and total morons all day.  Fourth was long, but i got an assload done, God I lvoe off periods, if it weren't for them I might actually, you know, have to do math homework at home.  And that would be a crime.  Took a rediculously easy test sixth, and then wnet to forensics practice where i proceeded to not get any work done and then drove around with a bunch of freshman and sophomores to Chipotle for no particular reason...they'd better fucking pay me back, I need that cash.  Maybe I shouldn't have done that....I jsut haven't been taking CX all that seriously since we didn't qual for state.  Ahh, that was sucky, sucky day, you go the entire day, thinking you did REALLY well, unexpectedly so.  You hit a reasonably good team alst round, meaning at least something's going well, and then boom, brock qualifies in extemp.  Dreams shattered.  Fucking judges, I hate them with an all-consuming passion.  Nest yera WILL be better, if Borkc and I could go 2-2 at quals with almsot zero experience, we can break next year.  That's all I want, to break to state, from there, sky's the limit.  there's always college to do better than that....  NDT here i come....(HA!)  I'm increasingly wanting to get outdoors, but I can just never get anything planned, maybe I could take Elliott up to the mountains aroudn his birthday ro soemthing, get up above Lake Isabelle, something of that nature, it'd be ncie spending some time with him and getting the fuck up to the mountains.  I'm also missing having a girlfriend lately, but I can't really help that particularly, Just give it some time, nahtan, just give it some time, things'll turn around.  Now if only laser hari removal surgery wasn't so expensive.  That was a joke.  I get so much shit for being jewish, it hurts, and I don't understand why.  i mean, hell, I was born into a differnet religion than 99 percent of american, whoopydy freaking doo, it doens't matter.  People just seem to be so damn fascinated by that which is different than them.  It wouldn't be so bad, thouh, if people weren't such dumbasses.  If i could count the number fo times people were surprised that i mentioned i had a ham sandwich or something, I'd be god damned deep blue.  Hoping that spring break will be mroe eventful than usual, but who knwos, that's a crapshoot.  Maybe something'll come up and i won't b ebored to tears, maybe not, either way i get to read the new Ayn Rand book that i ALSO can apply to debate that i'm getting: The new left: the anti-industrial revolution  I can almost taste the anthro answers...  ANd to end this, Luke Sweet, if you ever read thsi thing, you're still a dick
