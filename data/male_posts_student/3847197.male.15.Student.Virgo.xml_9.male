Read a few chapers in a book I'm reading called 'Angels and Demons'.  Then me and my mom rented some movies.  Namely Matchstick Men and Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.  Great movies.  Both had 'w-t-f mate? ^^' endings to say the least.  I had fun chillin' with her most of the day.  Good times.  Now, the bad news, I guess.  I don't really think it's all 'bad' news, just confusing news (in my mind).  I have referred to the past events as 'Kellie drama'.  I've talked about how she judged me, how she has done so much wrong to me, and all of that stuff.  But really, is it Kellie's drama?  She didn't create this.  Perhaps the answers to my 'drama' problems don't lie in talking with her, but within myself?  I've noticed I get frustrated whenever I see some of her entries (She has an online Journal).  Such as the recent one about her.  She has a cast on her wrist, and I have no idea why.  She told a good friend a secret.  Why do I get frustrated by all of this?  I guess it's because I used to believe I was a trust-worthy friend.  Not just to her, but everyone in my life.  It's not just me and her who haven't been talking as much as I'd like, either.  I feel like I'm helpless to help any of my friends.  Isn't that what we're suppose to do?  Help each other?  Then again, I'm never one to take kindly to help.  Perhaps I should take my own advice... I dunno.  All I know is that Kellie, Holly, Brian, Anna, and all of my other good friends are goin' thru a lot of shit they don't deserve, and I can't do a damn thing about it.  That tears me up...  I guess it's out of my control tho.  Anyways, I can't wait for school to start.  Been dull around here over the past few weeks.  Also, I think we found a house.  My next entry will contain final moving details and all that mess.  So I guess...  That is all.
