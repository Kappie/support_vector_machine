This one is the first name of a hip-hop artist who had a free song on iTunes (which I naturally downloaded...it was free!).  I also think its well suited to follow after the title "God Damnit."  Life has gotten better since last Friday, so I'm currently quite happy.  How I'll be after tomorrow's test...well, we'll just have to see, won't we?  I'm hanging out with Jack all day tomorrow, and then partying up it with Lelia friday.  I'll probably be hanging out with Quinn and Carolyn on Saturday, but thats not set in stone.    We're dissecting a fetal pig in Bio.  I probably could write a good post about death and mutilating the corpse of a baby pig, but I'm too tired to write up something that requires as much thought as a topic like that would require.    I might get to visit Andrea!  If I can get my act together I might actually be able to go, which will definitely make this summer awesome.    In Andrea's most recent Xanga entry she wrote about how she wanted to be "young" again.  Its strange because I really really  really  want to be 21, out of my house and generally out of my current life.  Only another 5 years 'till I'm 21.    Umm...nothing else to say.  Got my ticket-deal sorted out.  As I said before, my brain isn't functioning well enough to write anything of substance.  Good night.  - Brian
