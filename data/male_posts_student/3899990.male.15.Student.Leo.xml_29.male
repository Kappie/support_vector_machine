Geez, there's a lot of discomfort but a few Advil's will make it all better. =) After about an hour and a half, we went out to Damon's for lunch. There wasn't really a whole lot I could eat, so I ordered a chicken breast salad. It was a damn good salad but I couldn't eat any croutons because it was hurting me teeth. =( The sucky part is now I have to eat a lot slower than I used to. Oh, but the good thing is now I'm going to lose weight cuz I won't be eating as much! Good for me, cuz I need it!
