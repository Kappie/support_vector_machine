We pretty much stayed in and went computer and gameboy crazy!!  Well, I've not long been up now and it's 11:05am.  We might be making an early start to Sheldon's mum's house in San Angelo so I thought I'd better post now.  I won't be posting for up to 3 days max.  I'll be back with pics and stuff and a good blog entry when I return.  See you all in three days! lol
