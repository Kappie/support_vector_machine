But anyway, if you look back at one of my first posts, you'll notice that I mention a song by Superchic[k]. This song really is my song while I'm here at GSP. Here it is in its entirety.   Artist: Superchic[k] Album: Last One Picked  Song: So Bright (Stand Up)   you're bored, gotta wonder if there's more  waiting for the dreamlife you thought you had in store  trying to feel something you can chase a life thats thriller  living on the edge drinking, smoking dream killers  coulda been shoulda been woulda been,  what might your life have been  today you're not a has been  but at your life's end  will you have regrets then, have regrets then?  are you ok with today if tomorrow is the end  live today through the future's lens  don't wanna wish you could rewind and play it again   [chorus]  stand up write the soundtrack for your life  it doesn't happen to you you happen to life  stand up, you know you're gonna have to fight  don't wanna lose the will to find your light  stand up, God gave you the gift of life  it doesn't happen to you, you happen to life  stand up, do something with your light  you're a light on a hill, you're meant to shine so bright  so bright so bright so bright so bright so bright so bright so bright   we're all scared, gotta wonder what's out there  shooting down the ones who did what we wish we dared  everybody's scared to karaoke in the open  afraid we're not as special as what we might be hoping  so we're frozen, haven't chosen  just going through the motions  faith and belief, courage overrule emotions  stand up and be counted for something when it's time  decide where you stand, take your hands raise em high  live today through the future's lens  don't wanna wish you could reset and play it again  [chorus]
