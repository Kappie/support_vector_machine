Her comment said:  Would love to get your comment on Lynne Cheney's novel of steamy lesbian sex, "Sisters" published by Signet. Our V.P.'s very religious wife has her main character watching two women in each other's arms and thinking that their "passionate, loving intimacy was forever closed to her. How strong it made them. What comfort it gave."   Hey Elaine. I know an Elaine at my school. I want to get to know who you are. Who are you? Where did you find my page? I saw your IP address when going over my comments, and it seems like you are in the area by relating your IP address to another person's. Are you anywhere in the Maryland area?   By the way, it's curious that the professor who even got this book popular's name was also Elaine... Dr. Elaine Showalter. Any coincedence? Maybe this name "Elaine," being a not so average name anymore is really a cover name, or "stage" name, as it were.  About your question, I cannot give a good comment right now until I really look into it, but I will look it up and dediate another day's blog to it when I have formed an opinion. Let me ask you this: Why do you find that lesbian sex is quite so necessary? I find that the most comforting and strengthened relationship is that which is glorifying to God: a heterosexual (1 man and 1 woman) relationship.   So what type of books do you like and why? Your taste as of yet is reminding me of an ex-girlfriend, Arianna. (EVIL, EVIL, EVIL... Don't get me started.) She loved Anne Rice books, the vampirish smut that is filling the minds of teenagers everywhere with filth of sex with vampires and vampire on vampire homosexual sex.   About  Sisters , Lynne Cheney, should I stand corrected, is the wife of our Vice President Dick Cheney. I can't say that I think she is necessarily wrong yet, but what I have heard concerns me. The review I found so far says this: The book, entitled "Sisters," was printed in 1981 only in a Signet Canadian paperback, Dr. Showalter said, and is now extremely hard to find.  In the typically hyperbolic language of romance novels, the book's jacket promises the tale of Sophie Dymond, a beautiful, strong-willed widow who leaves New York to investigate her sister's death in Wyoming, and finds herself in a world "where wives were led to despise the marriage act and prostitutes pandered to husbands' hungers . . . where the relationship between women and men became a kind of guerrilla warfare in which women were forced to band together for the strength they needed and at times for the love they wanted." The review also stated the full quote you gave part of. The whole quote reads: "She saw that the women in the cart had a passionate, loving intimacy forever closed to her. How strong it made them. What comfort it gave."  I'm scared after that. I really am. I am a slight homophobe, so yeah. I'm scared.  But yeah, my full comment is that I think the book, from what I am hearing so far, is that it helps to take the things that God meant for good (romantic relationships), perverts them, twists them into what disgusting women would like them to become, and take them to the extremes unintended by God. And the Apostle Paul would like to have a turn backing me up in Romans 1: 24-27, 32:   24Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. 25They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator--who is forever praised. Amen.  26Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. 27In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. 32Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.   I will comment better when I have better insight on the book. Check back for more in about a week I guess.  Anyway, thanks for visiting my page. I hope I answered your question for a comment in the way you intended and/or expected. Comment again sometime.
