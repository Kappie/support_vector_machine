Here goes:  1.  urlLink Ron Howard  would play  yours-truly , I get the most comments that I look like him, especially when I need a haircut and start wearing my hat all the time.  Of course, he'd have to get a hair-piece.  And that guy he's talking to would play "that one guy I talked to that one time".  2. My best friend,  Stephanie Seales  would be played by one of the most beautiful and classy actresses that I've seen,  urlLink Jennifer Connelly .  Hey, I even found one with us  urlLink together .  Okay, so it would have to be a slightly younger Ron Howard.  I'm stumped, any ideas for someone to play me?
