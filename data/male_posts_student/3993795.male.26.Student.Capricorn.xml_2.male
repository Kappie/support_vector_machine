The guy who bought it is named Ido. He seems like a nice guy, I hope the bank would think thesame about his check. When he finally took the scooter away, I looked at them both, leaving me alone like that. That scooter was inseperable from me, and it didn't even occur to me that I would be needing to find some method of transportation later on the day.. I managed somehow, though.   Same day, later on. I gathered all my friends at my favorite place in Jaffo, called Pua (Pronounced Pu-A). My sister came, and also two of my x girlfriends.. You know how it is when you've got mixed thoughts about stuff? It felt a little sad, it felt a little happy. If I knew for sure that I would come back in 6 months, I would have felt better, but I don't know nothing right now. That's what I like about the situation, and it also terrifies me, deeply.  I'm working on a seminar about Japanese films. That's where all my writing energy goes (Sorry, my dear blog, you'd be my favorite when I'm done with the seminar, promise). I'm really working at full speed on this seminar. I wanna finish it by Sunday, and I only did about half of it, and still need to see two more movies. Damn. Pressure, pressure, pressure.  What else? I've started to look for a flat ib Beijing, Currently through the net. I already got two offers, one of which is somewhat kinky - Living with this woman and her 7 year daughter, and she offers to cook for me (God knows what).  I'm experimenting with my new digital camera, it would take some time (Possibly, forever) before I manage to create nice photos.  Anyways, this is the park in the rear of my house.  Till next time  Yi Tai
