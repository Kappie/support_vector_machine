I'm curious how she'll get the rich to pay more taxes when so many of the rich are prominent senators, congressmen, governors, mayors, etc...    Unfortunately it's usually the other way around when the poor will always have to sacrifice more than the rich.    Funny that politicians (much like in the U.S.) will spend millions of pesos for their campaigns, money that could be spent on social services like sending kids to school, feeding the poor, creating affordable housing, indentifying and addressing social injustices, etc...    LOL! GMA should have said 'will' instead of 'must' because 'must' sounds like a request but at least 'will' sounds like a command.    Who's to say thise rich fat-cats are going to sacrifice more based on their conscious or good-nature? Doubt it...    Japanayuki's in Maruglo! I ws told they're pinay 'entertainers' that travel to Japan every 6-months (every 6-months they need a new visa with a new name since I guess you can't work in Japan for more than 6-months ever). Anyways, I was told they make pretty good money and that they remit a lot back to the Philippines. They're just one type of the 1.4 million overseas Filipino workers (OFW's).    There was a leadership exercise on drawing our successes and dreams. Many people from Pilien (the Aeta sitio) drew houses and homes as accomplishments and drew larger houses and more land as dreams.
