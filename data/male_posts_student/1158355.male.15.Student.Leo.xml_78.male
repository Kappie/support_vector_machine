I basically hung out with Matt, Paul and Heaton the whole two days but now I'm going to check up on the orthodontist... well he's checking me up... or out... or or in... upside down? Then, basically I'm going out to dinner with my family and relatives for my cousin's middle school graduation. I love it, my family celebrates everything, and I'm reeping all the benefits! Mwuahahahaa, beer pong. All I remember was CAPS LOCK. I've come to a conclusion that this blogger helps me remember what I've done in the past days of my life. I'm like my grandma, suffering short term memory loss, succeeding in remembering what I did when I was 2. It's so ironic, I just want to go Poof! Ya... like the new template? I thought you would. Now I rememeber, I just rode my bike, drummed, got a strawberry icee just before, and yesterday played band with "them" and went to Ricky's and played this awesome game on the tramp. I miss tramp ball. Good old days with boys older and stronger than me. I loved getting whipped by almighty powerful Eric. His slaps would make me so happy, it made me feel loved. Ok enough of this, BUT I CAN'T WAIT FOR SIX FLAGS IN AUGUST! I wonder what I'm going to do this summer for my birthday. Ok gg cya people later. SHWOOOF!
