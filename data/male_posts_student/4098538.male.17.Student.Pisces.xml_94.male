She told me she was going to try her hardest not to let it go wrong. But the thing is... I don't know if I want to anymore. This always happens. We break up and I begin to get used to the idea. And then she calls me up saying she has changed her mind. And I usually go running back, no matter how she treats me.  So I am spotting a pattern here. I need to ask myself... will it go back to how it does every single time we try to make it work? Well it has every other time. Why shouldn't it now? Talk about a 'vicious cycle'! But anyway...  Mandy is trying her hardest to change my mind. She called me up in tears, telling me that she has thrown away 'the best thing in her life', and she wouldn't let me hang up. I really do just wish we can both be happy. But I know I won't if I get with her and I know she won't if we stay apart. So I guess this comes down to who's happiness is most important to me.  Right now, I can honestly say that I am used to the idea of not being with Mandy. It hurts, a lot, but I'm used to it. And I'm actually starting to look forward. I just hope that one day she will be happy again.  I often wish that Mandy never met me because I have done nothing for her at all (except bring her down time after time). She really does deserve someone so much better... someone who can make her happy.  There is still chance for us. But not yet. I want time on my own. To think about it. And to be sure that Mandy will be a little more grown-up about the trust and the stubborness. And I don't want her to wait for me either, just incase I don't want to be with her in the future. Then I will feel really guilty.  I won't feel any emotions that I shouldn't feel for doing what I need to do, such as guilt or regret. So this is what is happening. I am spending some time on my own (maybe a month or two) to think about what I need in life as a teenager. If after this time I realise that I do need her, then I will give it a chance. But like I said, I don't want her to wait for me... just in case...  I still love you Mandy and I'm sorry for the way things turned out. Hopefully you will get to read this...
