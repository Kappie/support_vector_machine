I want to go down the street to Walmart to get my photos printed in time for seniors leaving. Now she wants to finish her TV program, which is eight hours long. ASS. If she wants to watch reality colonial shit, she can get her ass of the couch and walk around CW and if your watching TV for that long, it better NOT be PB fucking S! It ends at eight, when the one hour photo center closes which is what the Fuji machine runs from. It is a holiday tomorrow (memorial day) so I can't get them done as the booths close.  Argh, so I'm going to use priority shipping from EZPrints so they get here quick enough. At least they wont be shitty quality. I still have to wait forever so my mom will type in her credit card number. She doesn't trust me with it as I could steal the numbers and buy stuff. Yes, because I'm that dishonest and could never get caught as it wouldn't come on her credit card bills from the bank I would do it. Yes, I am one dishonest dumbfuck. She can suck Beans left boob. Now to configure the ezprints info for the 50th time today so I get all the prints I want.   ASS   Rant over...
