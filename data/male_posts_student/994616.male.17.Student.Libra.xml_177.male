Aust: "I dont descriminate I pleace chicks asian caucasian black I squeeze (moan"  American: "It never quits(NOOOO) we need to carry 9mm clips(NOOOO) Don't wanna squeeze trigger, just wanna squeeze t*ts"  Hmm... maybe one's the radio version and one's the album version etc.... I'll have to talk to wilson....
