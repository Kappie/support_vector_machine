Jed's #2:  Each of you has a set of twenty questions, not just 20 for everything, right?  I can't read the rules.  Anyway, Yes to consonant. Non-game question: If I don't answer the question, I'm cheating and the game should end. *Yahtzi is not a yes or no question.  Nor does it have a number.  Yahtzee is a game with dice and players roll it in cups.  Stop yelling! .  Thank you.  Well, I am back.  I played Saturday and Monday vampire so I wasn't online.  I was hoping I could supply my online dope through school, because it is prepaid(in tuition).  Then again, it is always full.  I'm mostly online Wednesday, Thursday or Friday, hopefully.  If noone fills up the computer in school.
