This will be my first full week of school, because we only had it on Thursday and Friday last week, but that's because my district is comprised of a bunch of incompetent fools who spend all this money building statues and making their schools LOOK better, but can't afford 20 teachers in each school....  My schedule half-rocks, and half-sucks. Seeing as alot of my friends are in half my classes, and the other 4 i know NOONE. Well, i know 1 person in my spanish class, but only a little bit. I'm just glad i'm a friendly sonofagun, i can MEET people! It's too bad I hate most people. I h8 them so much i just wanna hit em with drumbone.        druuuuuuuuuuuuummmbone.           I wanna go down and play it, but it requires another set of hands and my family is sick and tired of it anyway. I should clone myself. OR better yet, get a mannequin*!   Well, there is going to be a lockin this saturday that i'm reeeeealy excited about, seeing as nothing exciting ever happens in school. It's a week away and i'm already jumpy about it. And partly it's the first time i'm gonna bring my (finished) drumbone anywhere. All of you people who WEREN'T there DIDN'T see my drumbone mishap at malvinas...... that was a bad day.  * = Thanks to Michael for the spelling
