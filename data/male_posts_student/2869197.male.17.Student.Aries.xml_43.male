There is the Brothers Karamazov...420ish pages...I'm still fighting to get halfway through it. Sabrael was a welcome break from the slow and deep-plotted BK. It was a Dungeons style fantasy about necromancers and the adventures thereof. A pleasant quickie.  I learn more of a possible new head pastor today. After our latest contestant chickened out, I feel a tad cynical, but will welcome him all the same. A thing I wish and hope for is a pastor with the youth in mind. This man worked several youth event up in Canada. Yes, he is unequivocally Canadian in nature and nationality. Why not? My dear sweet Grandma was an illegal Canadian immigrant. I've always believed that Michigan is really just a Canadian colony disguised as a United States...State. When the next Canada-States War occurs, I'd like to see which side we chose.  Speaking of comings, there recently was a going that occurred. Our youth pastor of 4 years, Jeremy Borger, decided to resign and move on to newer somethings. So many leaders are leaving in my life: Mr. Trujilo, Pastor Jeremy, Pastor Jeff. I seem to repel superiors, like some antistatist reverse magnet. We shall miss you, Sir Jeremy *salutes*
