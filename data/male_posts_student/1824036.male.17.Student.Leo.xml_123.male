I come in with an electric kinda just for background and to jazz it up a little. Tom keeps the beat with the bass. Then Shorty (Jake's nickname is Shorty) Pounds away SUPER LOUD with the drums.  After we were done liberating people with our rock, we went trough our wednesday night Crossfire sermon and etc. Then when that was all done Dan joined us and we practiced some more church songs. And dont get me wrong...most of your normal church songs are dull, but these ROCK! They are so up tempo, and I'm not that good when it comes to F and B chords...but its awesome!  After we were done with that, Jake and Tom and Dan and I (our band called Active Input) practiced our song called "In this Diary" by  urlLink The Ataris . Tom kinda likes it...but he thinks the bass part is too dull. So he wants to put his own bass part into it. I think he should do it!  Now Tom and I rock out major. I think we are the hardest rockers of our band. And now we have bloody fingers. Maybe Jake is though too...he broke his 2 brand new drumsticks today :) It was AWESOME. We were playing and then all the sudden no drums. Jakes stick busted into 4 pieces....so he used it anyways...and then he broke his other stick. So we stopped. About 3 and a half hours of pure playing!  Im pooped and I have a major headache. I cant wait til this summer. Active Input will rock the town of Humboldt with a passion!!!!
