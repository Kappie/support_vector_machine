PS i didnt edit the cussing.  Peg: How was it?  Edward: It was great. She showed me all the wallpaper and where everything is going to go.  Peg: Well that's nice.  Edward: And then she brought me in the back room where she took all her clothes off.  -ES John Bender: YOU ARE A BITCH.  Claire Standish: Why? 'Cause I'm telling the truth, that makes me a bitch?  John Bender: NO. 'Cause you know how shitty that is to do someone, if you don't got the balls to stand up to who you like.  -TBC Kim: Before he came down here, it never snowed. And afterwards, it did. I don't think it would be snowing now if he weren't still up there. Sometimes you can still catch me dancing in it.  -ES Andrew: What do you need a fake I.D. for?  Brian: So I can vote.  -TBC Edward: Because you asked me to. -ES Brian Johnson: Dear Mr. Vernon: We accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it is we did wrong, but we think you're crazy for making us write an essay telling you who we think we are. You see us as you want to see us: in the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions. But what we found out is that each one of us is a brain, and an athlete, and a basket case, a princess, and a criminal. Does that answer your question? Sincerely yours, The Breakfast Club.  -TBC   great, great movies.
