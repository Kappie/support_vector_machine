Thursday and Friday weren't that much fun, mainly because Tina wasn't in his 1st period class because she was at Azusa with Purdy.  But Tyke trudged through it and had fun with Karla.  Karla is a good girl.  On Thursday and Friday Tyke didn't really do anything.  Friday was supposed to be a day where the guys hung out with Mandy and Haras Relda but Haras didn't call Tyke back.  Oh well, there seems to be a pattern of that going on though.  I guess that Tyke isn't one of those guys you wanna call back.  Eh, no matta.  Saturday was ok.  Tyke had soccer in Woodinville right before the state playoff game but he won and scored a goal.  Then they went to the game and had some fun.  The second half was fun because he sat and talked with Tina the whole time.  If only the two were going out.  But then after the game they went to McD's (see Skippy's blog for a little more info).  Today Tyke had soccer in Bothell and he went with Macaroon and Tyronius.  They won and Tyke scored again as usual.  Then they went to McD's on the way home.  Then he watched football and kinda napped.  Then he came online.  Then...
