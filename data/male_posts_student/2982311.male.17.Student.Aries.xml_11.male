Joeseph's face was as black as night, the pale yellow moon shone in his eyes. his path was marked by the stars of the southern hemisphere, and he walked his days under african skies.  this is the story of how we begin to remember, this is the powerfull pulsing of love in the vein. after the dream of falling and calling your name out, theese are the roots of rhythm and the roots of rhythm remain...  in early memory, misson music was ringing 'round my nursery door. i said "take this child, Lord, from Tucson, Arizona, give her the wings to fly through harmony and she won't bother you no more."  this is the story of how we begin to remember, this is the powerfull pulsing of love in the vein. after the dream of falling and calling your name out, these are the roots of rhythm and the roots of rhythm remain.  Joeseph's face was as black as the night, and the pale yellow moon shone in his eyes. his path was marked by the stars of the southern hemishpere, and he walked the length of his days under african skies.  this is one of the songs that i remember hearing when i was a small child, and it seems that for that reason it is a part of me.
