What, people say that they are friends with me? I bet you that if I had any real problems they wouldn't give a shit about helping me. I know that, and I knew about it all along. WTF do you need friends for anyway? Some one to hang around with you so that u pay for their movie ticket, or their meal? Nah. I don't want any of that. Maybe I should try making people fear me, that would be another option, no one hanging on you for ur money, no one screwing about with you when they don't need anything special from you. All along, when I thought some one was my friend, I got screwed over, no matter if it was about a girl, or about something else. I realised that I don't need any support from other people, because I didn't get it all along.   If you are nice, then people will make use of you, and they will use you.   I stopped being nice to everyone, anyway, its just wasted energy, I had enough of people saying how much friendships are worth. They aren't worth anything, because you are  dependant  on others. I don't want to be dependant on some one, I want to be independent, and be strong, alone, so that I am more responsible. I started clicking around on google, and I found that there is a disorder which is related to this...  urlLink Dependent Personality Disorder   Wow, jeez, you know what? I might consider climbing the ladder on the FBI most wanted list, it must be fun, after all, you get to be on their website. I'll email them and say how evil I am nowadays, then they might label me an evil spirit, or a terrorist, or a marxist or something. Damn George Bush and his retard "axis of evil". Those good old Ukrainian citizens who lived in Hungary nearly all their life but got chased out by the FBI probably noticed the same things I did. Life is not about how much good you have done, its about how much you enjoyed it, and about how much you got out of it. There is no such thing as re-incarnation, we are animals just like the animals in the wild, why are we any different?  If you pass away, you will ask yourself what you have done in your life that you were so lucky to posess, and if you have been good to every one and then got screwed over all the time, then I think you won't be so happy after all.  Enjoy life untill you can.    urlLink    ANATOLI TSOURA, my new role model. Click on the photo to follow the link.
