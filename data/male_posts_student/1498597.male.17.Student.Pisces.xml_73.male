Both writers returned having committed a crime of not blogging at least two times per week. The return came after weeks of a leave of absence from  JR Ganzon  who was recuperating from a disease called,  schooli-vacationitis  which was curable with plenty of rest and fun activities. Meanwhile,  Mr. Brown  was busy telling the readers that each would both return to write thoughtful and meaningful blog entries soon.   "We were having trouble keeping consistent and fresh blogs," Brown commented via instant message on Friday night, "Everyone at Three Eye Corporation are ecstatic that we can finally keep a fresh and up to date blog." Brown did not comment in depth on why he did not keep the blog fresh in the time that Ganzon was on leave. "I had to maintain my own blog and my personal website," Brown stated.  Meanwhile, when Mr.Ganzon was questioned about his leave he was open and frank, "Actually, I was really kidnapped by the C.I.A.," Ganzon jokes. He goes on to say, "They wanted to try and silence me for exposing the truth." Mr. Ganzon eventually says that everything was indeed just a "funny fabrication" of the truth. When questioned about the future of the blog without him, Ganzon merely stated, "Well, I expect that my partner would have been able to pull through without me, but just the fact that it is a dual blog would kinda make it sorta...weird wouldn't it?" Ganzon said by instant message on Friday night. "And he'd havta pull all that weight like he has been for the past month or so. But I'm back to help out since this blog was built on our friendship in the first place." Hence, Mr. Ganzon is delighted to be back and working with his partner to continue the purpose of a dual blog: to have both opinions.  The blog, "Three Eye Witnesses" was born when Brown had an idea for two point of views to be provided to the general public. Obviously those point of views coming from Brown and Ganzon. On May 17, 2003 the blog was born and is still around to date. Since then, the blog has been listed on the BlogShares market and was trading at B$ 43.34 recently.  --------------------------------   ON THE INTERNET:      Three Eye Witnesses:    http://screwlife.blogspot.com   Go Ahead and Read This Only if You Dare:    http://home.earthlink.net/~nickbrown2k2/news.html
