Night Shamaylan movie:  weird setting and opening plot that eventually has a twist.  all of his movies are like that.  which is what i love about them.  so yeah... the movie was good... i was just expecting some scary so i was slightly disappointed.  i really wanna see i,Robot... and the Bourne Supremacy... but i'll probably wait for that to come out on DVD... but i've heard i,Robot is really good so yes.. that will probably be the next movie i go see.  so yes... after the movie we went of to L's house... Todd and i  TRIED  to make up a song about L's hair... didnt work to well.  L made some cheesecake which was good by the way.  the kids upstairs played poker... kinda disappointing since i dont like playin poker and i really would have liked to spend sometime with some of them.  thats ok cuz L, Todd, and i went outside and talked about stuff and such.  yase.. then i went home... lol.  ok enough bout what i did.  time for somethin different.  i was thinkin bout my current problem ((which i discussed with Ashley at the lock-in)).  where the  majority  of my friends are girls... but thats  ALL  that i tend to be.  extremely frustrating.  yeah.  sometimes i feel like the background in the some beautiful painting.  its wonderful... it brings out all the important things in the picture... but people really dont notice it... they always focus on whats in front of the background.   i hate being a background .  i wish some girls would look past what is in front of the background... i promise i'd try not to disappoint.  but whatever... i cant change the way people are... only dream.  oh yes... i've decided to start posting a little "my iTunes" thing at the end of my posts.  i'll put a link to the  urlLink iTunes Music Store  for whatever song i'm listenin to... so yeah.  goodnight kids.     my iTunes   >>    urlLink Nemo Egg (Main Title)
