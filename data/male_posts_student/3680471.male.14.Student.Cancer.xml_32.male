My brother bought me the coolest Family Guy poster last night, so I figured I would fall for it and do his website. Which so far is going good. Im also working on Hope To Carry On's website, and mine(  urlLink  http://www.dcsplash.com   ). If you know who Maddox is(if you know me personally, you most likely dont) He is just awesome isnt he. You know I just found out one of my Internet Buddies is a Christian. That is awesome. Me and Cassidy are like connected somehow. Im like you like Ashlee Simpson shes like yeah I got her CD, Im like have you seen those LiveStrong Bracelets, she says Yeah, Im wearing one right now.
