I've never actually used it, but it's for clearing water from my trombone. You put a rag in the loop. But still, sorry if I typo this entry, the metal thing is cylindrical, just over a metre long, and with a diameter of less than a centimetre. Not even to mention that one end's heavier than the other.  Biology exam went quite well I think but I don't want to talk about it much.  Sorry, can't concentrate, this is an immense task. I'll see if I can blog later. Wooo.  Love, Jon Roskilly
