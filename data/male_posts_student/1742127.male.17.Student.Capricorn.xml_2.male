They were going to let him, but now they're changing their mind cuz they want him to stay at home and "Study".:( But yeah.. newayz.... My cousin is graduating tonight. It's so weird cuz we're only two years apart! That's going to be me in two years!!!! :S Thinking about the future in that kind of way scares me. I don't want to grow up! I don't even know what college I'm going to right now or nething. I kinda want to go on a mission, but I guess if it's meant to be then I'll know. So yeah. Gotta go! Later! ~ChRiStIn
