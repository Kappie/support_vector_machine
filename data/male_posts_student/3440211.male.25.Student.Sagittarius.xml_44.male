Stamina is not back but hey many years and packs of cigarattes have gone by since.  I also taped Sandra's flamenco class yesterday. Will get some stills from it once I can. I felt really bad not being capable of speaking with my girlfreind yesterdat... mobile phone trouble? Update: No, she was not feeling to well and went to bed. I don't blame her.   My calculations have finished now it is just a question of seing the results... as the coffee kicks in I will give it a go.   The mood is energetic yet thoughtful.   The unspeakable is no longer present so there are no problems as such... just a lingering rage in the background awaiting its return.  Hell will break loose sooner or later.  I got a new sig as I replied to a friend.  Seeker with self-manufactured light.  Mark tells me as I inquire him a bout this last line, and what he thinks of it, that I am too deep for my own good. To stop thinking like this and do my work.... I think I will follow his advice and finish this post...
