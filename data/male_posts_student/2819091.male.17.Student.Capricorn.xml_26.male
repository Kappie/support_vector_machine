       
      I'm always here... Please remember that. I'm always here... To be your friend. I'm always here... For you.  I may not be able to protect you from your demons, I may not be able to say the most beautiful things, I may not be able to agree with you all the time, I may not be able to help you everytime, But please remember... I'm here for you.  I may be the one that was mean to you, I may be the one that would insult you, I may be the one that hurt you, I may be the one that you hate, Please remember though, I didn't mean to.  I'm not the perfect person for you, I'm not your guardian angel, I'm not a very talented person, I'm not the smooth-talker, I'm not the cool person, All I am Is me.  I know that you are expecting someone who is as perfect As the person you are dreaming of, but I could never be like that.   I wish I was, then you would love me without a doubt. You would always believe everything that I'll say... You would always back me up through it all... You would always love me... You would always care... But all I am...   All I could ever be... Is me.    I'm sorry... I'm not your cool and perfect guardian angel, I'm not your smooth, good-looking, and charming friend, I'm not that person that you were imagining about But this is what I could promise for you, though, I will be your friend and I promise you, I will always be there for you When I am able to.  I will always promise to help you as best I can, Though it may not be the best help you ever received. I will always be there when you need a crying shoulder, Though sometimes my shoulder seems to not be with you. I will always support you with everything, Though we may argue sometimes. I will always be there, Though I might be busy sometimes. I am here for you, Though you may think that I am away... I was here all along.
