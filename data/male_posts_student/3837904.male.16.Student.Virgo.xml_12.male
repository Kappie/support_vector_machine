I don't think it's fair for you to be so silent towards me and ernie. Well, if you wanna things to cool down then you could have told me. I said I wanted time off. I didn't say we don't have to talk no more. I can't believe you turn up to be in this way. Well, if you're willing to lose a friend, then I don't mind. Cause it's you who made that decision and not me.  I'm quite felief today. Was able to spend sometime chatting and smsing the one that I've part with pain. I think one goes and another come. But I would want both. Can't believe I nearly died today. Crossing the road blindly is becoming a trend.
