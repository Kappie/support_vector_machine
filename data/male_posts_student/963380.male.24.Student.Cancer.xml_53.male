Had a chappy call up and here's how the conversation goes.  Me -  "Computers, thanks for holding *me* speaking"  Voice of an obvious stoner trying to emulate Bobcat Goldthwait on every possible social, economic and spiritual level - "Hi there *snort I just *gasp* bought a computer from *snasp* you guys with a *gnort* one year warranty..."  Me - "Yup."  Bobcat - "and I was wondering... do you... does it cover.... I just ejaculated on my keyboard"  Me - "oh yeah. We cover it. totally"  Suprised Goldcat Bobthwait "you... like... *sngront* cover it if I..."  Me - "Yeah. We do. And you know what? Next time you're gonna shoot some cum on your keyboard, aim it up and try to get it in your FUCKIN EYE!"  Both of us - "Click"  I realize that the Crank Caller of Stupidity got what he wanted there... But it still felt good to get the last witty line in, sort of the final thrust in our witty rapier like repartee. The rest of the day was entrenched thoroughly in mediocrity - although there was a high point - had a computer expert friend (tm) come in to look at a computer for a customer and try to flesh things out  - He DEMANDED windows XP pro on the system he wanted - I asked him why and got the standard CEF(tm) answer - "It's better, Windows XP Home sucks". Which features of Windows XP Pro does your friend need, I asked. Of course, the CEF(tm) declined to answer that question, because, as I found out later, he wasn't even fucking AWARE, on some primal level, of the differences between home and pro. STFU SMF. GAH.  Work was a lot of wankin if I do alliterate so myself. Bought a lot of tin shit though - screen wipes, a mini mouse - a new mouse for my dad for Christmas and so on. One of the Mice had a negative cost in the system and the other had a cost of 18 cents.  My chair has started to squeak, but for some reason I felt dirty when I had the urge to lubricate it. Silly Catholic upbringing.   Watched the Specialist tonight after I ate dinner. Stallone bum was a bit much. Sharon Stone is a whore. I'm sure she's a lovely person, but GOD DAMN that woman has had ZERO issues flaunting her Tatas and all the rest. Tuck em away Sharon. It was good seeing James Woods again. I love the guy. So very very evil.  So Star Trek 10 and Lord of the Rings 2 coming out fairly soon, along with Back to the Futures 2 and 3 (along with One). There are no new ideas.  On that note, I'll bid you a Hammersteinian So long, farewell, Auf Weidersein, Good Niiiiiight!
