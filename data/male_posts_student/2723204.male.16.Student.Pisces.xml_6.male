I want to get a boss ME-50 ! or some stuff to improve my crappy, plastic solid-state amp distortion, and make it tube...........the ROAR of a 12ax7 with the grind of a el84 poweramp tube............but in the meantime i'll settle for second best, in multi-FX but distortion is my topmost priority.............(if you're not a guitar player....read the next paragraph lol......)  Right, i've been thinking about alot of stuff (as always.......), i've really been reading alot about christian feminism and really been thinking about the first thing that got me fascinated with society, theology and philosophy all at once, feminism, christian feminism in fact, it may seem to be like an oxy-moron, but i think that its highly possible. I don't feel that christian patriachal teachings are that consistent imo. Just a few verses by paul to get the women kept in the kitchen.............but anyway, its not that i don't believe in the bible or anything lol, far from that, here are a few arguments against patriachal teachings which use the words of paul..........       * The arguments for subordination: Women are intended to have a role and place under men, and are thus excluded from the ordained ministry. This is the most common evangelical argument against women in ministry, or in favor of a limited role for women under the authority of a man, and an enormous weight of cultural, philosophic and Biblical evidence is brought to bear on this point. To the extent that we have inherited Greek gender ideals as a part of our civilization these notions of subordination run very deep. The Biblical foundation of these arguments begins with the second creation account, where Eve was created after Adam as a helpmate, evidence that women were always intended to be under men. Subordinationists argue also, that the curse on women is prescriptive rather than descriptive. With these theological assumptions already in place the widely debated 1 Corinthians 11 passage: "the head of every woman is man, and the head of Christ is God," and associated demands for head coverings, are then interpreted as further evidence for the subordination of women.        *Other scholars have answered in rebuttal that later creation does not entail inferiority, as witnessed by Adam's place in the order - after lower animals, and the word "helpmate" is used most often of God helping people, and thus does not bear connotations of subordination. Furthermore, the curse on women should be interpreted like that on men, as an evil to be resisted rather than a burden to be accepted. Against 1 Corinthians 11 it has long been argued that many much clearer Biblical passages teach equality. More recently Paul's enigmatic utterances have been interpreted within the context of the fertility and Gnostic cults of the time, where the bared heads of women might be interpreted as symbolizing prostitution. Careful exegetes also claim that the word for "head" (kephale) is better interpreted as "source", rather than leader.     * The arguments on silence: Much is made of the injunction in 1 Timothy 2:11-14: "I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then Eve. And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner," and the 1 Corinthians 14:34-35 passage: "women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak..." Many commentators have long considered these verses to be culturally embedded statements, at odds with Paul's own practice, and Galatians 3:28. The Greek word "speak" (laleo) in Corinthians, is easily rendered "babble," and the word "silence" (sigao) bears connotations of desisting from chatter. Paul may have been seeking order in an unruly congregation. The rare Greek word translated "authority" (authentein) in 1 Timothy may be better rendered "usurping authority," and the word for "silence" here connotes peace and harmony (hesuchia). The references to Adam's priority and Eve's duplicity make sense as a refutation of the pervasive Gnostic belief in Eve as a fertility goddess, the source of all life, who cleverly outwitted the creator and Adam. This may be Paul's way of insisting that Eve did not come first, Eve's actions were a sin against the Creator God, and women need to be in harmony with rather than usurping the authority of men.         * From Genesis 3, and from 1 Timothy 2, it is argued that women are more easily deceived than men. These latter verses are most readily understood as directed against the Gnostic beliefs discussed above. But this concern over deception has long restricted women (the majority in most congregations) to teaching only children or other women. Questioning this position, others have pointed out the dangers of allowing easily deceived women to teach children. And as David Scholer has noted, the implications of believing women deceived "contradict the reality of the whole of biblical teaching, church history and human experience."    yeah, even Jesus himself did not say anything about female submission ! in fact, he did the opposite, not of females lording over men, like some bra-burning feminists, but he really broke the social norms of that time...........the reason why Jesus commended the woman with the issue of blood was her faith..........but since i was young, i was kinda puzzled, she had faith? she just reached out and grabbed Jesus' garment ! Okay, the shame factor was one thing, but if i had terminal cancer in my blood, lungs and liver, i'll grab Jesus' garment amongst a big crowd in Orchard Road all the same !!!! She may not even be expecting to get healed by touching the garment, but maybe just asking Jesus to slow down or stop.  I soon discovered that it was because she broke the social and gender norms of that time, it was then considered unclean for a woman to touch a man in public..........yeah, that was why Jesus commended her for her faith.........now let me put this in a more modern singaporean context.........lemme see...........ummmm.......umm.......ok.......say If our senior minister was walking down orchard road, greeting fellow Singaporeans along orchard, and there you are, your shirt is black, dirty, and your hair looks as if you're part of an experimental fashion program and you stink, why? You've spent all your money on treatment, dialysis, and the like. You can't pay your water bills for a decent bath, let alone get decent clothes.  Would you go up to the SM and ask him to seek redress for your case and lift your burden of at the very least poverty.........???  Is the person, dirty and sick, worthy of the senior minister's attention at all?. And is the woman worthy of touching Jesus to ask him to lift her burden of sickness over her life? The fact is no..........and that's faith. To break free from all social expectations of you............  Jesus was a feminist, he encouraged mary to sit at his feet to listen to his teachings, at a time when intellectual pursuits of women were perpetually banned. Well, you may think that women have the right to education. But the treatment of women by Jesus can be taken both Literally and Symbolically. It is essentially, the rage against patriachy, to crush the belief that men are always the leaders. Be it blatant or sublime, all of us should seek to constantly discredit patriachal beliefs and assertions. Be it in chivalry and gentlemanliness, or the system of disallowing or discouraging women to take up leadership positions especially in ecclesiatical circles..............  Ok, fine, i'm done ranting, i really seek your comments and if i find them helpful, feel free to e-mail me (if its a long essay) or to sign in the guestbook (is there a guestbook? i dunno lol, i'm still a noob here.......) but anyway, you can e-mail me at.......  ugmail544@yahoo.co.uk  (MSN accn. also)  By e-mailing me, you basically say that i can publish and rebut your articles here...............(unless you state otherwise..........)  I'm in a very theological mood recently, but not all my posts would be about Christianity lol.......
