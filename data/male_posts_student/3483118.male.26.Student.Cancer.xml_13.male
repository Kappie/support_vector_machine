And there are two people I have to thank for this: Miguel Tejada and Chris Berman.    Miguel - the Orioles' shortstop and only all-star - won the home run derby at Houston's oddly named Minute Maid Park, and Chris Berman, who was announcing the event, didn't give him his due.  In the second round Tejada hit 15 jacks.  15!  That's a record for one round of home run derby.  And what was Berman doing while these balls where sailing beyond the field of play?  He was ignoring homer after homer while talking to Reggie Jackson about, among other things, Derek Jeter.  Because, you know, if there's one guy who doesn't get his rightful share of the limelight it's Derek Jeter.  The combination of an Oriole out-slugging a bunch of guys twice his size and a slipping ESPN anchor completely blowing him off aroused in me the two emotions on which every sports fan thrives: triumph and indignation.  That couldn't have happened if I just didn't care.  So I found out that somewhere inside of me a baseball fan still lurks.  Not that you asked or anything.  Cheers: Houston's Lance Berkman for energizing the crowd with an impressive couple of spurts in the home run derby.  Jeers: ESPN's inexplicably stupid decision to go with a pitcher's mound camera instead of the classic wide angle shot that shows you the ball's entire flight.  Easily the worst mistake I've ever seen them make.
