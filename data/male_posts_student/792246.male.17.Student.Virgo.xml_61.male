The real truth of the matter is that it was a badly written, tangent filled piece of trash. I originally wrote it to vent, and it shows. I figured that since I spent so much time writing it, I might as well post it. About a day later however, Jonathan posted a paragraph of it on his site, and I read it and realized it was shit. So I take it down. I still agree with it all, I just thought it was ugly. Thank you, and have a nice day :P.
