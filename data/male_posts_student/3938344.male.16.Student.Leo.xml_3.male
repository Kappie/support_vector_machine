I'll list a few of them here, because I bet all 3 (on a good day) of you reading this are just dying to know.  I'm not at all worried about the November election, because that is a sure deal.  If Kerry keeps opening his stupid mouth and contradicting himself, he's done for.  Him and his prettyboy male prostitute of a runningmate, Edwards.  I'm not going to obsess about how we're all fucked from here to kingdom come if he gets elected, because it's not going to happen.  I'm more concerned about Hillary S. Clinton (S stands for Satan)'s campaign in 2008- you know it's coming, so don't complain about the Botox-using, personality-less dick telling us in completely uncertain terms what his stance is on every issue.  He'll campaign himself out of the running.    Punk is a dying medium.  You may not agree with me, but this is my fucking blog, so I'll say whatever the hell I want.  Punk is slowly losing ground to numetal bands, who are getting better and more numerous.  And again, I raise my imaginary tankard of mead in salute.  Rock on, numetal!  One day, the country will realize that they're being force-fed propaganda by the majority of news organizations and boycott them, evening out the political field again.  Those useless bastards will be forced to actually give news, so they will go out of business, and everyone will be on the same mental page finally.    Now, it's a good day when a christian metal band makes it as big as Demon Hunter has.  But when I realize their lyrics make fun of punk, it goes from being a good day to being an awesome day.  Get a load of these:  "So you can chant your anthems to the deaf And we can sit here and cry until there's nothing left Or we can take our voices with our hands Make like knives and make demands"  Those limp-dick punk bastards never saw it coming.  Disguised in the eloquence of the first track of their second CD, this is a jibe at punk's basic 2 modes: repeat the same damn thing over and over mode, and bitch about everything mode.  Oh, what a good day it becomes when I remember this.  If any of the 3 people I mentioned in my "God hates me" article are getting me down with their problems and their, I know I could always go back to Whitman and rekindle something that could get somewhere.  Yes, if you are one of the few people who know what I'm talking about, I mean the crazy Bulgarian.  Not exactly a prize in personality or beauty (or English skills), but it was going somewhere.  That somewhere was not very good, necessarily, but still better than nothing.  If I understood her right...  Sure, downloading music for free through programs such as Kazaa has become nearly dead to many people.  But it still lives on!  Hard-to-trace websites such as negativebeats (see the link in the title of this post), positivebeats (www.positivebeats.com), and elizov, who has nearly every linkin park song in existence (www.mp3.elizov.com) keep it going strong.  Pretty soon, the bloated, corrupt music industry will capitulate to demands to reduce prices ($20 for a 3-cent CD, no matter how good or popular, is fucking crazy), and it won't be necessary to download to keep money in our wallets.    Sure, those punk bastards have it awesome now.  Living the high life, doing everything (and everyone) they can get their hands on, living life X-tremely.  However, all I have to do is wait 20 years.  Those little pricks will be completely burnt out and peniless, and I will go and laugh at them.  Oh, will I laugh.  Then I'll throw them a penny, give a last chuckle, walk away, and forget about them.  Damn, giving up shit kicks ass.  And the last thought, the one that keeps me smiling even when I hear something so stupid it makes me want to projectile vomit for several miles. Within about 40 years, everyone will finally "get it" and realize that they're full of shit.  From then on, we can go and start actually doing something that can help everyone.  Well, that's enough for today.  If all 3 of you reading this like it, I might just make a follow-up.  Maybe.
