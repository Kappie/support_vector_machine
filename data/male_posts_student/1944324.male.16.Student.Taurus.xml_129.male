And, as every good webcomic teaches us, every group of good guys needs an ambiguously evil character.  So, we put up with you and don't take offense.  In fact we enjoy your presence. HOWEVER, the mean guy is not the main character, and many feel you are taking over the blog by posting too much.  And you didn't preface this niche, so Erin, who doesn't know you, obviously thought you were just an asshole (pardon my crude slang).   So, Micheal be your own person, but less often, and Erin, don't ake anything he says seriously.  If he says something that really offends you, don't tell Marten, tell him.  He'll probably apologize.  Otherwise I'll beat him up.  I've probably oversimplified, but that's my two cents. To everyone else who has dissappeared in the midst of all this, come back and do like always.  If you don't want to become involved in a conflict, just ignore it and post normal stuff.  The world needn't stop for Erin and Michael.  Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!
