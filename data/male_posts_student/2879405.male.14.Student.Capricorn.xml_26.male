I also believe that it makes full use of my june holidays instead of playing Computer games at home. If i ever get a chance to see a computer, what's next? That peer tutoring will be a good excuse to 'get out of home' and also make full use of my time. It will give me a very good experience to be a teacher rather than to be a student. But i may not be free. I have my softball training that cannot be missed out.
