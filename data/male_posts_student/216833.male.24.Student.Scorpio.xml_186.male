Today had to be the longest day I have had in a long time. For most of the day I had a fucking headache and it kept hurting, getting worse as the day wore on. I just finally got rid of it with some medicine when I came home. Now I don't want to go to sleep becuase I feel like I havn't had a chance to enjoy the day.  I read alot at work and actually watched an entire hour long episode of StarTrek Voyager in the back room while on duty. The jewelry store was extremly dead, plus I really don't care what I do there becuase I seriously only have three more working days left before I am finished with this silly part of my last six months. I hope the people at the book store are a little less obnoxious.   I have a few comments that I have pulled out of the book I am reading(A Peoples History of the US by Howard Zinn) regarding our little war we have waged against Iraq. This is mainly just knowledge from past events that seem to shed some light on current events. "All men of conscience or prudence ply to windward, to maintain their wars to be defensive." - Roger Williams Regards attacks by the English against the Wampanoag Indians which ended in 1676. And in such a world of conflict, a world of victims and executioners, it is the job of thinking people, as Albert Camus suggested, not to be on the side of the executioners. And even a Baptist Minister had something to say that caught my eye. He said that only wars of self-defense were just, and in case of unjust war, the individual was morally obligated to resist it and lend no money to the government to support it. This was in regards to the Mexican war that had begun in 1846. Rev. Francis Wayland was president of Brown University at the time of these sermons against the war.  I bought a new watch the other day, check it out fossil watch. I wanted to get another pair of jeans but I ran out of money. Spent alot of it on food. Oh, this was from saling my white vespa frame. The guy that bought it plans to turn it into a CCR tribute bike with refrences to the Big Libowski. hahaha. Silly shizzzzz   current mood:  good current music: the crimson curse - psycho
