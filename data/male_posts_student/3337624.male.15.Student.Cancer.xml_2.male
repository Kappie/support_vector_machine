Baisically my dad's in the military and we jsut got notified that we have to move to korea at the end of my school year which is may 27 and only 2 weeks away! Then i got a few C's on my report card so he goes psycho and grounds me till we move. Hes already cutting off the first real important social life i've had. I mean i've always had friends where we were stationed(germany, minnesota, washington, texas), but this is the first time i've had a lot of friends. One of my good friends is having a party and 2 days after he tells me about is when my dad grounds me. It was going to be my last party before i move and never see my friends again. Well i've just made a decision in my life.....Screw my parents. They've cut off my social life already, i've always obeyed them, well at least on teh serious stuff, i mean i'm not mr. goodytwoshoes (how do you spell that anyway?) but i havent really disobeyed them whenever they flat out told me no either. But now i've decided they can go screw themselves. They've taken away all my friends away, so they have no leverage onme. I'm going to go to that party, and spend every moment with my friends i can. I dont care if they take everythign i own from me, friends are worth it, even if i can only spend 2 more weeks with them. I figure my dad must be stupid. He thinks i value my computer or my gamecube or any of the other crap i own over time with my friends. He obviously never had any friends worth a shit or hes too old to remember what it was like. He has no power left over me, except maybe trying to hit me, and i swear if he does that he'll regret it. Well i think i got a little longwinded there, but i've thinking about how much i hate my parents for about a week before i decided to start this BLOG, so i've had a lot of ideas screaming around in my head and i just had to vent.
