Ted's a shriner - they're good folks - if, somehow, as a child, you've encountered some sort of flame based injury - they take care of you. Ted's a little path though - as in psycho, socio and -ological liar.   Here's the deal: He bought a computer off someone. I don't know who. The call comes through on my watch that the end of the world, despite the utter lack of raining fire and cackling horsemen, is actually occuring. You see, Ted, for all his claims of having more money than god, managed to buy himself a refurbished computer. Listen, for those of you out there who don't get it - if you buy a refurb, you're going to get a stinking good price. Think about why. It's still your call, but don't bitch when it's got some kinks that need to be worked out. Now Ted, he claims that he's just had a stroke and can't drive. So someone has to come out to his house and fix it there.  We don't do that. If you get hurt on the job offsite, you're fucked. Proper fucked. So we don't do it.  Until the dirty rotten pigfucker calls the Regional Manager on his cell phone. Then you get dispatched post-haste. Needless to say I spent many hours in Ted's old-man apartment, inhaling cigarette smoke waiting to die. I prayed death would come to release me. Yeah, didn't happen.  So I get a call today asking me to deal with Ted. The word no has never had a more vocal proponent then me, this morning. FRO - Fuck Right OFF.  So I'm waiting for the next call, begging for my help, No needs my support
