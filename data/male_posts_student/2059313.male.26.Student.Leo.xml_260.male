I hung, focused, and gelled the final lighting instruments I need for  urlLink Studio Player's  production of  Other People's Money .  Tomorrow at noon, the director and I, along with the stage manager and a stray actor or two, hash out how the show will flow lighting-wise.  I'm really excited about seeing what my first full design project is going to look like in the context of the show with people on stage emoting and such.  It's just not the same just staring at the set with lights turned on.  Now I want to see what people look like underneath the lime light (which there is none of actually in this show).
