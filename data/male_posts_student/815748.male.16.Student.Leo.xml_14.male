I had practicALly no homework yesterday, and little today; therefore I've been doing advance work so I won't have much homework later, so I'll do even more advance work, and the circle of no homework will continue, best case scenario.  It snowed maybe for hours today, and what is there to show for it? NOTHING! No snow anywhere in sight on the ground.  People who know about my hALf-day plan (you know who you are) get permission. Even if we don't see the movie, there are plenty of other things to do (like Newtonville Pizza, Cabot's, N64, Monopoly, and certain computer games).  My partner for Speech didn't do any useful work today. Well, you know the aphorism, if you want something done, get AL to do it.  Today is probably going to be my first reAL Mock TriALs meeting. Wish me luck in getting a gouda role.
