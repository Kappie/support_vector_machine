Why should i have to listen to these people ?!? their beliefs, pillars, and teachings have done nothing for this world except to divide humanity and help us destroy ourselves....We stand at the brink of destruction and still they point fingers at one another, blaming each other; no one willing to accept their part in what they have created...why should i stay here any longer ? i do not want more pain, more sadness, more anger in my heart; i just want peace...i want the constant torment of my mind to stop...i want the thoughts and nightmares to end so that my soul can rest.....i wish i had a true freedom where i could do the things i wanted, think the way i wanted, love the way i wanted.... but this world would not allow it.....my angel, take me away from this horrible place full of hate, darkness, and depression...take me away from here..take me away.....
