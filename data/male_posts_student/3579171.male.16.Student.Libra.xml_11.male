There's only a few things wrong wiht that.  First of all, it's a  test .  Second of all, it's a  driving  test.  Lastly but not least, it's in the morning.  You all know how I take tests right?  I know for a fact the people who I know that took calculus probably do.  I wing them like a mo-fo.  The results: 99% chance of failure, 1% chance of  maybe  not failing.  Ok, forget that it's a test.  It has to do with driving!  Everyone knows I'm obsessed with racing games... but that's just games.  I can't actually do what I do in games in real life.  My driving skills are terrible in real life.  I seriously mean terrible.  If any one has ever sat in the car while I was driving, they'd be scared for life.  They'd be so messed up mentally, they'd freak out just be seeing a car.  The last thing, it's in the morning!  I am possibly the worst morning person ever.  Ok, imagine the American Idol judge Simon.  Now imagine Simon on crack, ecstasy, marijauna, and every other drug possible at the same time.  I'm not done yet, now, imagine the drugged up him drunk like a monkey and trying to kill everyone around him.  I'm that him, but to the millionth power.  Getting up in the morning for me is like diggin my self out of a grave(kind of like Uma Thurman in Kill Bill 2, except Pai Mai never taught me the one inch punch).  Anyway, if I happen to miraculously pass the driving test in the morning, then maybe it might be possible for me to pick up girls after all!  It's commen knowledge that guys with cars have a higher chance of actually hooking up with girls.  Having a car shows the girls that you are somewhat independant, even though your car was bought with your parents money and the insurance was paid for with your parents money.  Anyway, here are the chances that I figured: Guy with out car: 5%- 40% Guy with car: 41%-75% Guy with nice car:75%-100%  With those percentages in mind, I figured my percentages.  Here they are: Me with out car: -100% Me with car: .5%  As you can see, once I get a car my percentage with be non-negative and any percentage thats not negative or zero has a chance of happening.  There might be a chance for me after all!  If I happen to pass the test tomorrow, I'll be on the road to to ending loneliness once and for all!  Ohh wait, after my license I still need to get a car, and after the car I still need to get insurance.  Let's see, I predict if I get my license tomorrow, I'll get a car the end of senior year.  That means I'll get insurance a couple months after that.  Which means I'll be able to drive freely in December of 2005!  YEEEEESSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!  Now, pray for me to pass the test tomorrow and if you read this after the test or didn't pray for me, then I hope you burn in hell.  Just kidding, but pray for me ok?  Ohh yeah, almost forgot.  I realize my recent updates are lacking horendously in humorous and interesting material.  This can be easily seen, my previous post received  0  comments.  Forgive me, it's hard for a loser like me to fill in for a genius like Wesley, I'm trying my best...  - Some loser
