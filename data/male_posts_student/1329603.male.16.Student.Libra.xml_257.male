Just been thinking (well, mostly been reading Gem's blog, but you know, same difference) about next academic year. Next year, I will be able to live out the Huggies maxim, and become a 'big boy'. Seriously... next year I'll be able to have conversations with Laura and suchlike about Psychology and stuff, and I'll be able to talk to Fi in German without her criticising me all the time, and know Othello backwards... and do my Grade 7 piano... but in actuality none of it really matters. I know who I am, and going up a year of schooling isn't going to make me feel better about myself. What WOULD make me feel better about myself would be passing the NYO audition - to do this I need the NYO to REPLY TO MY EMAIL and then I'll be fine.  I'd like to say a whopping big 'thankyou' to Laura and Fi for making me feel good about myself for the last few hours. Just... *hugs lots*  Love, Jon Roskilly
