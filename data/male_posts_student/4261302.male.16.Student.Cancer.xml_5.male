Im supposed to be putting large amounts of mony in my brand new current account, which I'm very proud of, as if most people my age haven't already got one. But thats been moved to tomorrow, so never mind. The wasps are mounting an offensive, it seems, as one flew into my mouth and two others were in the lounge, both disposed of. Why they are still here is a mystery, as the nest they had in our roof as been professionally destroyed. Ive got used from going to full sleep to running out of my room at the sound of a wasp, to avoid them stinging me repeatedly, which they like to do. I've killed over 10 this month, one with my bare hands. Anyway, I'm still working on my website, which will take a long time. A very long time. It needs completly redesigning. I need to add a link from there to here too. Anywho, time to get on with it then. (Did I just type anywho?). I'll post either later today or tomorrow. Bye...  P.S. I weigh exactly 11 stone.
