He's managed to  urlLink funnel $22.5 million  into the proposed Northstar Commuter Rail project, in a move that almost makes me like him. Besides putting the Taxpayers League, a no-new-taxes group that absolutely abhors public education or really any other services the state provides, ahead of the needs of Minnesotans young and old, Pawlenty's not such a terrible guy.  This rail project is exactly what the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro needs. Congestion here is maniacal at times, and with the rapid influx of Hmong, Somali, and Latino immigrants, we're really in no position to stop building up infrastructure. We're lightyears behind similarly sized metropolitan areas, and with the newly completed Hiawatha LRT, a commuter rail system is the next step (well, besides expanding said LRT).  Props to a crappy governor for doing at least one thing right. I'm still voting against him when he's on the ballot, but hey -- this takes a tiny bit of the pain away.
