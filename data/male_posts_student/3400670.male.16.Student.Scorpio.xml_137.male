But seriously good GOD lord, contrary to most people, to me, I actually have MORE stress now after taking this one AP test. Holy lord.....four more to go, four more battles to be fought.  Yeah I'll probably come to Skyview tomorrow after school review session just for the heck of getting in touch with society and conversing my mental state of stress with others (hopefully I don't contaminate other people with my stressed out minds).  All I have to say is that hopefully the History test goes better than today's kick-off AP test.
