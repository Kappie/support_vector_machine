After school I had like no homework so I did a good favor for Dave and made him his dirtbike movie with music and everything, its' great. Ask me for it. The ending is hilarious. http://www.theviralfactory.com/gallery.htm Click there for funny videos... of course their fake. Basically that's all I did, was make the movie and play Zelda... then I went to sleep. Good Night.
