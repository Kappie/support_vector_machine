My hate for Perry Farrell could have not, and can not be stronger. For he has both helped brake up Jane's Addiction, and has helped cancel his original, beloved festival, Lollapalooza.  My anger stops, and I decide to finally download  Kazaa Media Desktop , again, for the ninth time. So, I manage to sucessfully download the program in ten minutes, a new personal record has been captured by myself. I am pleased. So, I gather the portion of my latest and most recent CD lists. For my love for CD's and constant plans to buy certain albums forces me to write them down, or I will forget them. I download sections of certain albums, or any band name I see on the list. Finally, my eyes catch The String Cheese Incident. Though I am quite familar with String Cheese, I do not own all of their albums, and do not know all of their songs. So, I proceed to download. The jam happy, band that is String Cheese always attracts me, being that my favorite bands are usually bands that perform positive, jam, slightly technical, songs. And live for live concerts and events.   Following the downloading of several songs, one including a cover of "Ripple" by The Grateful Dead, I remember their spot on the Lollapalooza band list. I think, and I am ultimatly depressed.   Over the day, my anger and sadness over power my good side. I begin to release madness upon my cat, my family, and a waiter at Denny's. I even remember my last trip to Disc Replay, and how each String Cheese album was over twenty dollars, and used. I almost gave a lick(I say lick meaning punch, not lashing of the tongue, ass) to the cashier in the face. So, throughout this July, I only ask people to remember The String Cheese Incident, and either listen to them or eat a stick of string cheese or any kind of cheese.   My depression is over exaggerated, but none the less...
