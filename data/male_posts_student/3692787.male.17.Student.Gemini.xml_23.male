(i would have watched in araneta with some la sallian friends, but they so totally bailed on me)  wow, they really do suck! i had to see it for myself or else i never would have believed it. but then, i couldn't help but ask: why? why do they all look like they could be beaten by a rag-tag bunch of WWII veterans, each with missing appendages? normally i really wouldn't care, but i would very much like to have no weaknesses when i next meet my friends from high school... *begin future sequence* me: yes, i suppose life as an iron chef isn't all that bad. x: tang ina mo paker hina niyo sa basketbol! me: oh really, how impertinent! that, my friend, was uncalled for. how are you doing old buddy? x: tang ina mo paker hina niyo sa basketbol! me: i say, do stop this right now! how very uncivilized! x: tang ina mo paker hina niyo sa basketbol! me: ULUL KA GAGO TANG INA MO MAHIRAP KA POTA BOBO KA MANGMANG PAK U! *end future sequence* ...as i like to say, this is clearly a loose end, and all loose ends must be tied. and so, i invested some time and thought into this whole recruitment process and what could have possibly gone wrong.  is it because of UP's weak sports program? i had heard from friends that players of other universities, say, ateneo, la salle etc. receive huge benefits: cars, condominiums and the like. i figure this could be part of the problem, since UP really has nothing more to attract promising young athletes to join their program other than registration perks and a UP diploma. while the most fanatically loyal and arrogant amongst us peyupsters would like to believe this is enough to snag some talented players to our squads, the fact of the matter is this really doesn't amount to diddly-squat. really, is it so much to ask for all-u-can-eat street foods, free toki rides, one valid uno in a subject of the player's choosing, up to 100 pages of free photocopies of anything, or shopping center gift certificates? whoever's in charge has obviously forgotten to pick up a copy of "da rulz of life"-- if ya got it, flaunt it.  seriously though, they have some major issues to work out. honestly, it's as if they don't know nuthin' 'bout the game. they all be trippin' with the wack ish biatch! so, as a semi-fan AND veteran spectator of many a NBA Finals series (i needed something to tide me over while waiting for Star Trek Voyager), i would like to offer my unsolicited advice. *clears throat*  that spherical orange thing is called the "ball." when you have the "ball," we say that is "good." when you don't have the "ball," we say that's "bad." but, even when you have the "ball," it's a "bad" thing if you hold onto it for too long. so wait a minute here, perhaps you're wondering, "what in heaven's name am i to do with it then?" well, that red thing that's stuck to a square panel of glass is called the "rim," and that dangly white thing under the "rim" is called the "net." now, the object of the game is to take the "ball" and put it through the "rim" and "net." when you do this, you "score," or amass "points," but only if the "rim" you put the "ball" through is "your rim." you'll know it's "your rim" when some "guy" who's wearing a "jersey" that has a difference in color from the one you're wearing tries to put his "hand" on the "ball" as the "ball" takes its natural "flight path" towards the "rim." now, when the "ball" hits the "rim" but doesn't go through it, you're supposed to "grab" the "ball" to try and put it through the "rim" once more. this is called a "rebound." i know that sounds confusing, but stay with me here. after the "time" ends, the "game" is "over." we find out who "won" depending on who has "more points" or the higher "score." when you "win," we say that's "good." you will then seem very attractive to "girls"... oh, right, you know more about that part than i do. any questions?  completely wrong thought of the day: i always thought the anomalous shift in the cosmic order, which has a huge bearing on my life would, like, i dunno, line up the north star with the moon in the fifth orbit of the space station karshrak xer'nul with a highly concentrated level of theta radiation in the delta quadrant where the holographic matrix shall be distorted by the tachyon pulses emanating from the anti-matter within the proximity of the temporal prime directive, which shall cause the formation of anti-neutrinos. err... what was the question again? sorry, you lost me.
