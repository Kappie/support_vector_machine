You’re probably thinking “bus drivers, who cares, they are just the guys who get me to school” well this article is not just about bus drivers. It’s about giving bus drivers the power to remove students off buses for swearing, vandalism, spitting and just generally being uncooperative and unruly. The State Government drafted this law (or bill for all you commerce freaks) last night, probably out of boredom and thought this power would be useful to bus drivers.    Ok, I will admit that us students can be a bit unruly at times, usually after either something really good or something really bad happens, but it’s like teenage human nature. The bus drivers and the public we travel with should know all about Generation X and how at this age our raging hormones causes random acts of unruliness and recklessness. I mean everybody goes through this faze of rebelliousness, even people as dull as bus drivers. I mean how times have your parents told you about all the crazy antics they got up to when they were young? I know my dad is always saying, “When I was your age, I had street fights everyday (yeah right) and I would always come home bruised with lots of cuts. Why aren’t you like that Wayne?” Well in this “civilized” society that governs us today, getting into street fights usually results in bruises and cuts as well as assault charges, lawsuits and probably juvenile detention. To avoid “juvey” us teenagers have to find someway to channel all that pent up energy our parents used to do crazy antics right? And what better way to do it than to be unruly on public transport?    Everybody who catches the 651 in the afternoons would have at least experienced one of those times where the kids keep pressing the button and then the bus driver stops at the next stop and doesn’t move until someone gets off. Usually in these situations the kids win because after a while the bus moves without anybody gets off. Now bus drivers would think the students’ press the button to annoy him. This is true but only to a certain extent because we also push the button because we like that sound. In the society we live in we don’t here many bell sounds and the one of the bus is the only one we know of. Why can’t you bus drivers leave us bell-deprived kids alone?    The State government should thank us kids as well because we are doing them a favour. We are conditioning the bus drivers. Pretty soon bus drivers on school buses just learn to block it all out, all the noise just becomes background. Because they are not listening to the noise they are more focused on their jobs, getting people from point A to point B. We are indirectly providing the government with highly focused, mentally strong bus drivers. Of course there are those who have a mental breakdown while driving a school bus, but just forget I mentioned them. The government should make it mandatory that trainee bus drivers have to do school routes for at least 6 months as part of their training.    Fortunately for school students the Parent and Citizens Association does not want the bill to be passed because they say if you kick off a kid in the middle of nowhere (like Whoop Whoop for example), nowhere near other public transport services, then the child’s safety is in question. Students are stranded and unable to get home and they call their parents who get quite pissed off that they have to get to Whoop Whoop to get their kid. The PCA reckons bus drivers should not determine whether a situation is right or wrong, they should report any incidents to the school and let the school deal with it.    School students do annoy bus drivers, but it’s for there own good, the same type of good that parents say you will thank them for later. Therefore bus drivers should not be able to kick off students. I rest my case.
