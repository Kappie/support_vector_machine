Today was a great day though and it is days like this that let Tyke know that he is so lucky to be who he is.  As you should know Tyke already had big plans for his day but he sorta got lazy to start them off.  He woke up at 10 instead of 9 and then sat in bed for a half hour and tried to figure out why his mom's van was outside but he wasn't sure if she was home.  So after showering he walked all the way around his house to try to find her but couldn't so he decided that she just wasn't home.  Then he played with his MP3 player for a while.  He deleted a lot of the songs on there that he didn't like listening to in Europe and then put a lot more in the deleted's place.  It took a while but it was worth it.  Right now Tyke is sitting at the computer typing away while "Vindicated" by Dashboard Confessional plays over and over as it is on repeat.  Such a great song.  The lyrics don't apply to Tyke right now but the melody is just so great.  Well actually Tyke now added Hands Down to the playlist so now two DC songs are playing.  Hands Down, one of Tyke's all-time favorite songs.  Well while Tyke was doing his MP3 thing he got a call from Purdy asking if he wanted to come over.  So Tyke quickly got ready and left.  He went over to her house and they greeted each other for the first time in 3 weeks.  After seeing each other almost every single day for the entire school year it sure did suck not seeing Purdy this whole time.  And Dotti, Karla, Tina, everyone.  It was really hard to get through it.  Tyke has been taking the time with others for granted way too much.  But today he didn't take for granted.  They went to Evangel, Kinko's (man there are some stupid/weird people working there), Bell Square, and that cosmetics store by Ted Meyer.  Tyke told every detail about his 3 weeks to Purdy and she hopefully wasn't bored by it but hey, she asked to hear about it.  Tyke realized while telling everything that it was hard to recall every single thing he did cuz there was so much.  But it also took him a long time to tell everything.  But he did and it was great to spend some quality time with her.  Tyke got a great smoothie at Orange Julius and they ran into Macaroon and K-caj unexpectedly at Brookstone.  Damn there is some comfortable stuff there.  It's fabbbbbulous!  But they spent a while there before finally satisfying Purdy's shopping needs and then they went back to Purdy's house where they split up for a few hours.  Tyke went to Safeway to the BECU branch to try to set up his checking account but of course since he is a youngeon and still a minor he couldn't do it right there since he needed his parent's signature.  So he got the stuff to do it later.  And he ran into Commander Cool who works there so they talked for a few minutes which was "cool" (get it? cuz that's his name too).  Then Tyke went to the post office to pick up all the held mail from the last 3 weeks.  He got it and, as he told Karla tonight, it was like Xmas for Tyke to look at all the mail he had waiting for him.  He loves getting mail.  It's so fantastic.  Especially when it is money!  And he got his grades too, 2.45 dropping him to a 3.2 GPA total.  Yep, a lot of people seem to have higher expectations for Tyke's GPA's.  Come on, give him some credit.  Then he looked at his dorm assignment for WSU.  Much to his chagrin he found out that he was not in his 1st choice for halls, not even his second choice in fact.  He got his 3rd choice, Stephenson.  So he isn't with Ekul or Kinker.  His roommate is Brett North from Tacoma (anyone know him for some odd reason?).  So Tyke was pretty bummed by that for a while.  He wanted to be in the same dorm as Ekul.  It would be really fun.  But of course Tyke can't get his way everytime (or a lot of the time in his eyes).  After his disappointment set in he had dinner and waited until 7:20 to leave for Purdy's again.  He got there, chatted a little with Purdy and her parents and then Naan came too.  Then they went up to Ekul's house and picked him up.  Then they went to the UW campus for The Inn.  It's like Refuge was but the college version.  Refuge was better but this is still good.  Tyke will make it a regular occurrence.  While the lecture was being preached Tyke just kept thinking about his own life and what he was missing.  He tried to find in himself something that he could use to fill that void but he knew there was only one of 2 things that can fill it.  Tyke doesn't know if he'll find either for a while.  It isn't like either is just going to jump out at him and magically send some sign that Tyke easily recognizes.  It's going to take patience and Tyke has to hold onto the last threads of patience he has in order to keep sane.  But it's really getting to be troublesome.  Tyke had forgotten what it was like sitting at home every night in the dark at the computer wondering what it would be like to have that hole filled.  However, every time he tries to fill the hole by reaching out to something he finds himself recoil back into a familiar pain that strikes him throughout his body.  It starts softly and then pulses steadily until he can feel his blood carry the discomfort to his chest and there it grows.  Maybe that made it easier to connect with Tyke but if not, don't worry.  Tyke doesn't want you to know what it is Tyke feels.  It isn't all that pleasant.  But he knows that everyone must go through it at some time.  Well after The Inn the 4 drove to Wendy's and got food and then went back to Purdy's and watched TV until they all left.  Then Tyke came home, cleaned out his car for his mom who is driving it tomorrow cuz her van has died for some reason and then he came downstairs to listen to music and blog.  And now that he has completed the blog he will finish off the last playing of Vindicated and try to vindicate himself of the pain by sleeping for hours.  If you want to hang out with Tyke tomorrow, which is possible if you have read this far in tonight's blog, you'll have to set something up either at his house or pick him up cuz he'll be car-less til his mom gets home.  Bye for now.
