If you're going to read this post, however, you get a run down of the boring past two days, not the exciting future week.  Yesterday I played FFXI....lots. Almost gained an entire level (really 2, but I had so little XP left to go for the first one that I'm not counting it) by fighting in Batallia Downs. Kazham needs to go die and take all of its evil Gobs with it. Also started the first Splinter Cell on Xbox (again, I have this habit of restarting games that I'm not all that far in if I haven't played them in ages) last night, but I'm still on the first level. So much for trying to diminish my backlog of games this summer.  Today was a little more active, but not by much. I went out to lunch at Cici's Pizza and then came home and started playing SWG. Not really sure how I've done comparatively in SWG today to FFXI yesterday, but I've still made progress. I also explained to my parents about upgrading their cellphones to GSM (I'm the only one with that right now), but I still need to get them to go to Cingular and actually do the upgrade.  Yeah, that's it. Sad, huh??
