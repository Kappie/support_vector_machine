Too bad we dint get first for decor, spoke to moor house exco, we agreed we could tolerate the other getting first, but not bayley...coz bayley has nothing much, and our stands were so happening...but too bad...we got first for cheers tho...i dunno how tt happened lolx...  It was really fun lahz...i never expected to be one of the exco standing in front of the house cheering and everything...sprayed my hair gold too...looks cool lol  then later went to celebrate at swensen's with mr jo, ms johnson, and the hullett exco; they were really nice, treated us to earthquakes n fries...mmmm victory tasted so sweet...hahaz  then today went for the theory exam, finally everything is over...i can have a gd sleep now...continuosuly doing the questions for 3 hrs is really  xiong ...waa got headache now...hope i can get my cert...
