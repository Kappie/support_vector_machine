And free.  You know, its been a little bit since I saw honest to goodness Anime.  I'm not counting the Animatrix.  Slayers is funny as hell, a lot like 8-bit theatre.  What WAS the last anime I saw?  Cowboy Bebop episodes, maybe?  Oh well, you know?  Anime isn't my life.  So eh.  Friday... I volunteered and trained Angela.  Some of you may know her.  I'll keep the last name confidential.  While we were up there we talked and stuff, it was pretty alright.  Right after school, though, some kid tried messing with me, so I pac'ed his hand out of the way and put my hand right to his throat, "Don't mess with a guy who has Kung FU written in Chinese on his shirt.  Worst mistake you could make in one day." So after volunteering, I forget what I did.  Today I worked and got oil all over my Columbia jacket.  I liked that jacket!  So I left it at the dry cleaners.  They can clean it, right?  It was windy as heck today.  I guess Gary's not a bad guy.  I make him out to be such a weirdo, but in fact, I guess I don't have a whole lot against him.. I guess I just associate him with work, and Wes no likey worky!  Unless I get paid.  After work I donned a headband and spiked my hair up, wore my kung fu shirt, and later went to an Indian store.  Hahah, I looked so Whapanese, it was hilarious.  So anyway, after that happened I watched Slayers and then played Legends(great game), and here I am now!  My dad is putting a lot of effort into my car.. waxing it, vacuuming it, cleaning it, sanding the rust spots off.  Tomorrow, we're gonna repaint parts of it.  I think he's using this work on the car as a way to indirectly spend time with me, and/or help me out.  You know?  I say 'you know' a little too much.  But thats my theory about him.  I love the guy, I wouldn't be here if not for him, eh?  My mom is doing great, she's not dying her hair anymore, so now its silver.  Really, I never expected that, even though before, thats what color she said her hair is, I never believed.  Wow.... makes me wonder.... my parents are old.  Agh.   Death.   AGH.  Not enough time?  Agh.  She does good tai chi and some kung fu, I'm impressed, I'm glad Derek taught her some stuff, its neato.  Wow, I never expected this entry to become long, but look, look, there it goes, getting long.  Hahaha.  Sexual innuendo.  Agh, yet another cliche.  Agh, randomness.    Condoms!  Where the fuck did that come from?  Am I putting in enough emotional content?    Its not like I have a whole bunch of problems, mainly one or two.  Or three.   School, work, money, and girls.  Ok, thats four, but every guy has those problems.  Eh.
