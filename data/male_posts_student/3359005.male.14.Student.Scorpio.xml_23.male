Supposedly it is the "Last thing you see of a drowning person." I really like it. Who'd think that you have an art form besides thosed stupid sandcastles on a beach.         From the big hand the teams went into the tree area where they hunted for ferry tickets. They took a ferry to an islan and went to a meat farm to recieve their next clue. At the meat farm, they found out that they had to carry a huge slab of beef to a meat shop. It was a very uncreative challenge, and my favourite team, Charla  Mirna, lost their lead because of the sheer physicality of it. I feel that for a team to gain a lead using their wits, and then to lose it because of their disability, is super unfair. Boo the producers!         Then came the Detour: Chips or Zips. Chips involve the team going into a casino to play a game of roulette. The teams start off with 20 chips, of which they can only use 5 at a time. They must match the number of the landing to get their next clue. My call, 4 attempts of 5 chips each will take you less than 10 minutes. Just bloody well try your luck! For some reason, there are no pics of them playing chips. Zips involve teams having to cross buildings on a zipline, then descend almost 20 storeys into the pool on another. That will take them about 20-30 mins at my guess. Might as well chips first, then try the zips!         Here's the pit stop photo which they didn't have in their photo album, It's different from the other photos, cause it's in a different section of the site...        That's all with their limited photo album. But Dennis  Erika, my initial favourite team, got eliminated! Sucks...
