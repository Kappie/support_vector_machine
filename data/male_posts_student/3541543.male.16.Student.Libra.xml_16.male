(touche) feeling like i had to one up him or something, i have no freaking clue why, only later did i realize that those promises didnt mean anything.   after i said "well you always sorta look for that person" and i thought everyone did, but i didnt mean as in im picking you and all that. im was just saying that sometimes you wonder and think about it ya know. anyways bout right there i screwed it up, and right now we are in this weird zone. she doesnt want to talk to me i believe because i would prolly bring all this up and she would just get pissed and everything.   and i know this is just coincidince but sometimes it feels like the world is against me for being with her. Garret "ya know in few weeks she will prolly break up with you" Sprint "after SPEC i bet she is gonna dump you." also the fact that aaron said "uh ohthomas. ashleigh hasinternet back,better not talk to her on msn it will screw you up" (damn psychic). and also whenever gabe and ashleigh arent talking and being friends we do great, but as soon as gabe and ash start talking again its all messed up. and im not saying that this has any correlation to what happened, its just something im sure a few people have noticed.   anyways, i panicked and didnt explain clearly enough.i also believe ashleigh thinks the only reason i changed what i said was because katie told meto "DONT EVER MENTION MARRIAGE TO GIRLS LIKE ASHLEIGH......ETC." but come on ive known you for almost a year now and i knowwhen ur weirdedout or uncomfortable. im in this weird spot but i hoping we can just forget it, because it was just a misunderstandingand ireally liked where we were a few days ago.i mean im just happy where we are and im only interested in you right now and im not into finding the girl im gonna marry. idk i hope you can understand what im trying to say ash.
