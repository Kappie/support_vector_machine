This is also to show up my friend Garrett that it is not that hard to set up a blog (if you have a brain).  Just kidding, anyway.............                                                      This whole week has been one giant stress ball of poop ( yes poop ) cause i kinda procrastinated on two projects until the last few days they were due.  YIKES never do that.  They were spanish and AP European HIstory.  With Spanish I had to make a house and label all the things in Spanish like refigerator would be el refrigerador (el re-free-hair-a-door)  and such.  I totally out did everybody in my class on it, i built a 3-D model out of cardboard and painted it various colors.  WOOOHOOO Colors.  anyway, my letter that i had to do with it rocked as well.  My teacher (very cool) said that mine was the best that she has seen and that I'm gonna get extra points!!!! Which i better get more points because i spent 3 days straight doing it.  I went to bed at like 1 am every night.  For Euro I had to do 80 key terms.  Doing like 20 takes like and hour and a half, i waited till the day they were do.  HAHAHAHHA figures.  took all night like 8 hours. Gonna post more later.  Oh and Garret thinks he is so smart but u cant force the hand that slaps the horse  (patent pending)
