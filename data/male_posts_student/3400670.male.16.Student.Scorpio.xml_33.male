Throughout the movie the wives of the to be astronauts were depicted as obedient to their husbands even if this was not in compliance with their personal feelings.  The prime example of such characterization was demonstrated in the scene where the astronauts were being interviewed by the press and the question arose of how the astronaut's wives felt about their husbands going into space.  In response, all the astronauts replied that their spouses supported them 100% in their pursuit towards space, when this clearly was not the case for all of the wives.  Finally, one aspect of the film that stemmed away from the stereo typical gender roles was the relationship between Alan Sheppard and his wife.  When urged by his superiors to tell his wife to speak with the press/vice-president, Sheppard disregards this pressure, and supports the wishes of his wife to be sheltered from the invasion of the press/media.  Any other thoughts?  Benjamin
