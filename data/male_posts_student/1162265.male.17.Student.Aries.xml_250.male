So that was failure.  Next, school day was fine, I resisted the urge to cut economics.  I convinced myself somehow that it would be worthwhile, we got a huge packet for break.  So that was a wise move.    Afterschool.  Walked home, glad that stage of my life is coming to an end.  Next I took a shower, mainly because I felt grimes since I couldn't remember the last time I took one.  Which probubly meant Thursday morning was the last time, considering how bad my memory is.  So then we went to pick up Nia, who just got braces.  Funny.  Train station to go to Morristown too see Sonya.  I almost got on the Gladstone line, but fortunately I found out last minute.  So I arrived in Morristown sometime later.  No Sonya.  Oh no, I thought.  Maybe she played me for a fool! So I began to overanalyze the situation and paced back and forth.  People were walking by and speaking Spanish! What a hectic language when your stressed! But anyway, somehow living in Morristown didn't dilute her sense of CPT.  So she showed up along with her friend Jen.  Coffee Shop.  Rain.  Burger King.  Home.  It was far more detailed then that, but that's the basic rundown.    Why is it that people from other towns universally seem to look older then people from SOM (S.O. Maplewood)? I noticed that at first in Cancun, but also, Sonya and Jen both look like I'd expect high school students to look like, and even talk like.  At Columbia something just seems different, everything feels like bitter Middle Schoolers, even if I can't remember much of middle school.  That was just a side note of course.  Train situation going back was the best.  I said adios, and got on the train.  The lady said "Next stop, Morris Plains."  Shit.  Morris Plains was taking me even farther away from home.  The lady asked where I was going, and I says to her says SO.  She frowned and said we were going the other way, and I'd have to wait until we got to Dover for the train to turn around.  Fair enough.  That took forever mind you, but it happened.  As a side note, a huge amount of colored people use the trains, it seems so strangely disproportional since everywhere we went we were picking up Latinos, Blacks or Indians.  But anyway, I had to get off at Summit because it was direct to Broad Street.  I stood around the station in the cold, got on the train, came to SO.  Stood around in the cold, and then dad picked me up.  Now the fun began anew.  We're going to Florida at 6:00AM TODAY.  It's currently 1AM, and I'm trying to stay up in the hopes it'll weaken me for the flight.  I'm not coming back until Thursday, but my dad is a jet setter so I should be on and off the internet over the next few days.  I'm just that cool.
