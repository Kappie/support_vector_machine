But it's late, and I'm tired and stressed. So I'm going to use this post just to rant. If you do not want to read my useless ramblings, stop reading now. I'll give you a second to think about that.        Good.   Ok. I worked today from 11-8. I hate that shift, because when everyone is leaving at 5, I can wave goodbye to them and say "See you later, I still have 3 more hours!". That's always great fun. So I get to work the same shift again tomorrow, and then twice next week. Fun. I had to deal with registering my schedule for next year at Durham College tonight. It was an unpleasant surprise when I realized there were no good schedules. Then because "somebody" wasn't responsible enough to be home when we had agreed to meet online, I missed out on the best of the bad schedules. Because I was nice enough to wait and watch as the "good" schedule filled up. This is probably going to sound lame, but I'm going to say it anyways. The Leafs organization is just pissing the hell out of me. The more I think about it, the angrier I get at Pat Quinn. The man is quite plainly still taking the position of General Manager, with JFJ simply signing the paperwork. As much respect as I have for the man, I think it's time for the Leafs to make a change. Tonight I was blessed from a friendly email from a close friend of mine. It basically outlined that I have been treating him like shit for our whole lives, and he's sick of it. Well there really isn't too much I can say about that is there? I suppose I could write up an 1800 word email and send it on over to him, but I'm not like that. So anyways, it's 1:13 AM, and I'm going to go to bed.  Until next time.
