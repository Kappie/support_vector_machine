After school I went over to Logan's house, then Anthony and Josh came over; we went down to the creek and went wsimming for about an hour. Then Anthony and Josh had to go eat, then they came back and we had a pinecone fight, except we didn't use pinecones; we used sheetrock. Me, Anthony, and Logan were up in the treehouse, and Josh was on the ground, later he started throwing rocks at us, then he hit Anthony in the back of the head with one and Anthony just went off on his "BEEP". Punches were flying, then the fight turned ugly, so I threw a handful of rocks at Josh, then he left, just as Anthony got a baseball bat. Tommorow is the Edge! It is so awesome. Well, anyway, I should probably get going, Night.  13 1/2 Days of School Left!!!
