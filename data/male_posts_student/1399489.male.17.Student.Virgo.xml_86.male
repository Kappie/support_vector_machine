When i got home, things were really stressful around my house, some of u prob know why, so i said i was going to jessica and just went to watch the sun set for 1.5 hrs up at our lake, i took lots of good pics!  then after that i ate at jessicas.  that felt kinda weird tonight, not the food but just being there. i really dont know what to think about us right now.  i dunno if we should just be friends or keep dating for awhile or what. im emotionally confused.  she will prob read this and get all upset but i really am just trying to figure out what i think is right for me at this time. ok well im goin to use the phone! im out, g'nght!
