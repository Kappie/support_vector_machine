I'm not making shit up. She is talentess. Period. Anyway, back to the discussion. My classmates at school, who call themselves "metalheads" (how lame) say that Nu-metal sucks, and that only bands who are "underground or unkown" are good. This is bullshit. I don't care if you like pop or metal or rap, the point is: if it's good, stop talking shit.
