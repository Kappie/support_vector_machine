It seems impossible because.. if robots can break those laws, there's nothing to stop them from taking over the world, as humans have grown to become completely dependent upon their robots. Or maybe... they already have? Aiding Spooner in his investigation is a psychologist, Dr. Susan Calvin (Moynahan), who specializes in the psyches of robots..."    Predictable, yet thought provoking to say the least.I, Robot is a typical summer blockbuster which exceeds normal standards through asophisticated plot. Instead of common non-stop action and violence, the movie's pace is slower and relaxed. Thisgives theaudience time to take inkey events and story points.The flick's dialogueand events are routineand common amongsummer movies,yet,most of the action and commotion ties into the desired storyline effect. This makes for a more rational,audience pleasingmovie. Themovie alsoties in the emotions and feelings of the robots instead of making them immediate villains.Therefore, itmakes the robots more understandable.Viewers have the ability to connect andactuallyfeel sympathy for the non-human characters.    A certainconsiderationmust be given to the creators of this movie.It is common among large scale productions like I, Robot to fallaway from the originalstoryline (Minority Report, Bladerunner, Robocop, A.I) yet, the makersstayed true to the foundationandnovel by Isaac Asimov.    Rated PG-13 for intense stylized action, and some brief partial nudity.
