Before I weigh in on Kerry's choice of Edwards as a running mate, I need to share some thoughts on Fahrenheit 9/11, which I saw several days ago.  It didn't quite meet my expectations, but it was entertaining, moving and infuriating.  My mild disappoint is probably the result of unrealistic expectations.   My principal criticism concerns sequence.  After the initial chapters concerning the lead-up to and aftermath of September 11th, the movie transitions rather abruptly to the Iraq war, and then later backtracks to the run-up to it.  I would've reversed the order of these two segments.  It would've made for a more even, cohesive picture.     Stylistic concerns aside, the movie has one great strength - it breaks away from journalism that buys into what war correspondent Chris Hedges calls  urlLink the myth of war , which basically means that Moore strips the war of its delusional heroic rhetoric in a way no major outlet could or would.  Sectarian squabbles about the fairness of other aspects of the movie cannot detract from the real, horrific light it shines on our campaign in Iraq.    Note: I use the word sectarian rather than partisan because right wing voices are working themselves into a fervor of religious magnitude about this film.   See the movie for yourself if you haven't already.  Rarely will your $8 be so well spent.
