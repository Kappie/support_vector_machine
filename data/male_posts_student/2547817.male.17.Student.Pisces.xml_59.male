Bottom line is faith. Asked Eric plenty of questions about his lesson today. Either he can't answer me or I can't understand him. Either way, it's not working out.  Listened to a damn good example of false teachings today. Appalling.  Jaryl told me that someone would be pissed if I joined AC choir. I asked who and he said Joshua. That waterpolo come choir boy convert not happy that I'm joining the Choir? I'm the one who shouldn't be pleased. I haven't been in contact with him for over 3 yrs now and he still makes racist comments against me. I feel like using an expletive. I left my old class because of him and his immaturity. Apparently, some have disabilities growing up. Well, I'm a stronger person now. Can out-talk the mongrel anyday. I hear anything and he'll know about it. So will everyone else. Not even in the damn college and have enemies in it already. How lucky.  Goodnight. Love you.  I miss Zel still.
