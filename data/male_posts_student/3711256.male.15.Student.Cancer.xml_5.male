If you didn't already notice, I changed my user name from Wee Laddie to Sammy Smalls. Wee Laddie (according to a source that would wish to remain anonymous) sounds possibly perverted. That thought had not yet crossed my mind, so thankyou, random person with dirty mind.  Anyways, not much has gone on today that needs talking about, so I'd best get going. Expect more tomorrow.
