One of these friends was Chelsea...and while I was burning it, I realized that she may not like this film, as it happens to be written by a group of sexist English men. I'm almost afraid to give her the CD tomarrow in case she would be offended, as if she is, I may lose a friend in her...What to do? Aight, that's all for now...no wait...it's not. I changed the color of the scrolly-bar on the right side of the window (for IE4+ and NS6). Now,  that's  all.  --Raine
