Don't leave them, now. Lord, please.  Stay with them.  Wrap your huge loving embrace around the Seales family and squeeze with all your might.  Please continue to help me through this time as well.  It kills me to see my friend sad, although I know it is a normal part of this process.  Give me strong arms, a strong heart, and a wise mind.  Lord, You are great.  I know Steph's dad is up there cracking jokes with my dad, and having a good time.  Tell them that a lot of people miss them, and that we'll see them soon.  Dad, take Melvin and have a great time... tell him about time the snake that grabbed your leg.  I bet he'd appreciate that.  Lord, we know this should be a happy time, and a time of rejoicing, but it's difficult for us to think of it that way.  Our selfish hearts don't want to let go of people as the leave this world.  Jesus, I just ask you to ease their hearts, and help Stephanie and Doris to remember the good times and think of him when he was full of life, and not cry because it's over, but smile for the time they got to spend with him.  In your loving name.  Amen.
