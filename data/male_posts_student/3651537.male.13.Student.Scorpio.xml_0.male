Of course, we stayed in a hotel called First World Hotel, whose standard was not really like a first world country. Plus, it was a standard room.   Then again, i suppose that at Genting, i wouldn't be spending much time at the hotel, which proved to be true. I was too occupied either playing the indoor games, or the outdoor ones. The indoor games were fun, if a bit addictive and therefore expensie. In the two days that I went there, i spent $50 on the games...well not a lot but still quite a fee.   The outdooor games were...thrilling. I tried the Space Shot, where i dropped from 12 storeys down(maybe more)and back again. Surprisingly, i didn't scream...how exiting. I closed my eyes though...oh well. I also tried the Corkscrew, a giant rollercoaster where I went upside down twice. After these two rides(which we tried first)the others paled in comparison. I wanted to try go-karting, but forgot to bring shoes. Typical. I just would have to be contented with driving a cirtual car at the indoor games.  Nothing else really. Bye.
