I look at the piano score on my keyboard, I ask, why do I play so hard for? My amp, my guitar, why do I practice so hard to fully learn all the positions of the G pentatonic. I ask, why am I doing all this? I don't know why. Maybe its just that I believe in myself? or what?  I know that whatever talent I have is still very much undeveloped, but after all, every human being has talent. Why do I work so hard? So what if one day I win the nobel prize for disconvering a safer way for nuclear power generation? What if one day if I become some grammy musician? So what? Who do I have to thank? Who can I say my thank yous to? My friends? Yea, people whom have helped me in the course of that, maybe.  What I know now is not much, I have yet to compare with people who truly understand physics, or music, or sociology or anything. But what is the drive which would make me want to achieve great things? What is the point of wanting to achieve so much when the two people central in your life cannot even drive you to want to achieve that. When they constantly remind you of your weaknesses, and never once told me to "go on, you can do it.". Have they once acknowledged what I have inside of me?  What I need most is people to spur me on, people to assure me that I can make it, I can do it, never mind if you don't know how to solve the schrodinger's equation, never mind if you don't know the 7 major modes, never mind if you can't play the piano that well. Never mind if you can't understand what Foucault has written. Never mind that, one step at a time, I know you can do it. Who has ever told that to me? No one, i can say that no one has ever done that.  Have you wondered why I've been searching for mentors in fields which I am so interested in? I am not only looking for people with superior abilities, but also people who can spur me on, to encourage me. I can never forget my motto to learning anything in life, think that you're good but not good enough. Who can I have to give me the right balance? Who can I have to be my central pillar of support?  Have the 2 central people in my life encouraged me to read more? I would be so happy if they just asked me, "so what have you learnt today?". Sometimes, they being involved in the things which I want to achieve in my life, is so precious to me. They won't ever understand that. I don't know what they care about in my life. I don't know what do they really hold in priority where my life is concerned.  I don't come from a broken home, in fact its still very much intact. But how can one expect to achieve anything big in life, when you know the 2 people central to your life aren't part of it.
