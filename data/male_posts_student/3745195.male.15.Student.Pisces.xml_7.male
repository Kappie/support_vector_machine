If you wanna get to know me read this and maybe you will.  Today was pretty good. Woke up at 600 am at my friend's house (stayed the night and we played Need For Speed: Underground) and i was supposed to go home then, but i fell back asleep and didn't wake up until 7:30 again. I went home got a little breakfast and then hopped in the shower. I went to X-C conditioning and it was mega-awesome. I got to lead the pack and set the pace. At first I was scared because I always went to fast when setting the pace for the J.V. guys, but now that I'm with the V guys I geuss I'm better. This is where I'm meant to be. So anyway practice went great and nothing aches or is sore which is a plus. So, Paul Calvert (senior) gave me and J-Long (junior, looks like me) a ride home and then I got on the comp and played Unreal Tournament 2004 (demo) and then I went up to the dollar tree to meet Anisia and go shopping for the food for the party. We got some stuff and then high-tailed it outta there and went to the bank and Anisia's mom asked me if I knew how to work the coin machine and i did, but we didn't end up using it at all. LoL. So Anisia got money out and then we went to Costco. Soon Anisia spotted one of her friends and she left me to go off with her mom (very akward). Finally she caught up with us again and then it took her like 20-25 min to decide what she wanted to get for the party and then we left and Anisia's mom dropped me off at the church by Arin's house because she didn't know I lived back towards Barnes. So I ran really fast back home because I had a Trio meeting to go to about the basketball/streetball tournament i'm going to in Idaho. Then I cam home and my dad had to go back to forest grove to take care of one of his tennants problems (he had to leave father's day too). So i ate dinner with my mom and my grandma and my great aunt. (My grandma and Great aunt are visiting for the week) Then I got online and talked to Eva for a bit and realized that she hadn't been invited to the party so I was about to ask her, but she had already signed off. She does that alot, signs off and doesn't say "bye", maybe it's because of our past. Idk, but one thing I do know (that I have never told anybody) is that everyday since the accident I have felt ashamed. I've felt ashamed for loving her and i try to tell my self that Arin was my friend long before I loved Eva and so the day of the accident i made a promise to him and said that she would always be his and that I would only make sure she was being safe and happy, so yeah. Wow that's the first time I've ever said that and I feel like the biggest weight has been lifted off my shoulders. well i guess i should end with that because it's getting late (when you wake up at 600am during the summer 930 becomes late [runnings a biatch]) well i guess i'll see ya'll around even though nobody will ever read this anyway, nobody ever does. Catch you cats on the flip, flop later.
