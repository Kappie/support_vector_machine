I thought "okay, this girl will be maybe around 8 to 12 years" and told her, I'd like to meet/see her once. But another surprise was awaiting me: it was a beautiful girl with the age of 20! We chatted all day (around 4-5 hours) even though in Japan it was already early morning. And this chat was really embarrassing but at the same time my self-confidence rose because both girls always said "kakkoii" or "kawaii". Damn, I don't know what I would do, if I had to choose - I really like Misa and despite her age she is sooooo sweet and beautiful... and her niece is sweet and beautiful too, but I don't know her well yet... Oh my, my life is getting more complicated - I like that ;-) until now, my life has been rather boring, so from now on it's time to live ^^
