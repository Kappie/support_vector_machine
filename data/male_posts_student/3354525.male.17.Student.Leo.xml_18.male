Stop and take a moment to think of all the brave men and women that have allowed us to enjoy our lives in freedom.  It's been one hell of a Stanley Cup Final to date.  Martin St. Louis scored to force a Game 7 last night in double overtime to send the series back to Tampa for a winner-take-all final.  Will it be Jarome Iginla leading his so-called 'underdog' Flames to victory, or after 22 seasons, will Dave Andreychuk finally get to sip from Lord Stanley's Cup?  In entertainment news, OJ Simpson has expressed interest in hosting a reality show.  I think he should just SLASH... or cut... that idea.  Maybe he could call his show "You've been Juiced."  Ba-doom tssssh! ;-)  Some food for thought... in Iraq, citizens are paying a mere 5 cents per gallon for gasoline compared to over 2 dollars in America and close to 6 dollars in Britain.  The average vehicle costs about $1 to fuel whereas the Brits are paying upwards of $127.  For future reference, we should let the U.S. invade Canada so they can subsidize our gas prices too.  In the sporting world, Smarty Jones lost the Belmont Stakes thereby failing to win the Triple Crown. Smarty, now worthless and a 'one-trick pony,' will be shot and used as children's glue by next week.  And finally, former President Ronald Reagan lost his decade long battle to Alzheimer's on Saturday.  He will always be remembered as the man who won the Cold War.  Rest in Peace, Ronnie.  1911-2004.  Until next time...
