I just thought that Sam would like to very, very smugly inform you that yes, he will indeed be returning to Pate's yr 13....My mum drove me and Tom from Highnam to Cheltenham in the morning to get the results....     Psychology - A  (and get this - 100% i.e not  one mark dropped in the whole paper  of memory and child development! :D)  English Literature - A  (and a high one! 95% for the whole of  Wuthering Heights  and Harrison. SMUG.)  Biology - B  (in your berloomin face Mr. Dray/Mr you-cant-do-this-you're-rubbish-and-foolish.    Philosophy  Ethics - B  (cool, but dissapointing in the end cos I got 94% fucking percent for the whole philosophy paper (and there was me stressin bout it to Regan on his blog) and 80% for the whole Ethics paper, would you believe - so like high A. But then a D for c/w - I put my heart and soul into the c/w, it was on Materialism  Dualism, Descartes etc, and my teacher, Mr Gardner only commented on my 7 (coutn em) drafts, never marked, and Mrs Sibley (ugh) refused to mark it, so it must have been totally wrongly done. Oh well).      Did anyone else find the results sheets totally confusing? I screamed at Mrs Smee at one point, trying to help me out but just shoving the "which subject are you dropping, then?" sheet right in my face in a totally Pate'sy way. Ooh, and no I shall not do retakes unless I'm fucking forced to, Pate's is sooooo annoying like that.       But yeah, AABB is a fab result, REVISION PAYS OFF KIDDIES!      Smiles. All the while.      Currently listening to: "Flashback" - The Beachump play - in my head.
