I've jsut spent the majority of today modeling, no not male camra modeling lol but 3d modeling in 3D Studio Max. I re-created a Star Wars blaster in 3d and then for my first atempt ever textured it. I think for my first atempt at texturing I did pretty well. The blaster is shown below! I hope I can keep up the good work and make more improvments since I'm taking up in teh field of 3d modeling for game design as well as  a minor in C++ computer programing. Well its about 2:00am and I think I may need to hit the sack so I'll post more tomarrow!
