I forgot to bring it on Wednesday... well, not forgot, hadn't finished it. He didn't ask me for it so I didn't give it over.  I bring it to Maths C today and hand it in. He says  B: Sorry, Adam. I can't mark this. A: Um...? B: You handed it in late, and the rule is that if an assignment is handed in late it you'll get 0. A: So I'm gona fail Maths B? [that's my half assed attempt at a guilt trip] B: Well, the assignment was mostly MAPS, so it won't affect your mark too much A: Ok *silence* *back to work* I'm clearly pissed off!  I mean... I'm a maths fan-boy! I do two maths well, and he decides to fail me coz I'm two days late? WHAT IS THE WORLD COMING TO?!
