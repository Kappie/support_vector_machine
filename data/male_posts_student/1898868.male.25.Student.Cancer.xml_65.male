     
      Well, I just signed up on-line to join Whitey (and Aaron Mlot) in the marathon. Who else is interested?  Also, tomorrow morning I leave for a few weeks. I will try and get on the computer every once in a while (you know, to check the blog), so hopefully I will have stories ofyetis and crazy mountain men for you.
