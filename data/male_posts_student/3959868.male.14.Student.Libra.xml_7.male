Kinda fun..... Got home and screwed around for a while. Then I called my girlfriend and talked to her for an hour or so. I'll post more stuff about her when she forgets about this journal. ALL GOOD STUFF. Made homemade ice cream with my family. Relatively fun. Better to eat. Had a cat molest my leg. My sister beat me up with a bag of magazines. Ok, so she swung it at me for annoying her and hit me square in the gut. It didn't hurt suprisingly, but I was hungry afterwards...... Then I listened to music on got on here talking Brian and Rachel(gf).
