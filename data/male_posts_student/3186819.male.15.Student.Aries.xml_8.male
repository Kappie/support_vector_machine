Stuff by Duff are disgusting-looking clothes and accessories aimed towards the "tween" phenomenom and are supposedly for up to 16 years (aee http://www.stuffbyduff.ca). I am sick of them. "My stuff is now at Zellers" is constantly spoken, filling the void that was left by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. Its annoying! Stuff By Duff is everywhere advertised and it is driving me crazy. So this Stuff, apparantly by Duff (probably she never saw the clothing before production) is at Zellers.........
