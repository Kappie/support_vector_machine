Nick0 - !~ ThINk ~! says: then we got onto how Daniel said that a Sian  Trav relationship would only be illegal if it were sexual  Hmmm...... okay.... I hope he doesn't read this but, does anyone else think Daniel is really freaky? And WTF does he start to yell when he reads infront of the class?  "um, okay, i'll read: AND SO THE COWS ABDUCTED THE SMALL MINDED BOY AND" it's soo annoying.  Oh and in English today, HAPPY BIRTHDAY BEC - wow, I complain a lot huh. Well, tough. I better do my science assignment... meh... um.  Yeah, in Maths, I was stereo-hit, I told Tash I'd get her a GI-Joe for her birthday, with the underwater suit thing so she could play with him in the bath, and we (sian, me, tash) started laughing, and they hit me at the same time... ouch.  Okay, okay, rambling, so what! Um, until next time (which, is, very, soon)  Goodbye!
