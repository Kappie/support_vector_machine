In fact, I spent the majority of the day leaning on the back counter, talking to  her , as we do almost every time we work alone together. Yes. It must be my mind that is tired.   I've been seeing a lot of my cousins lately. In the past week, I've seen both Jamie and Candice. It's been years since I've seen either of them, which is especially sad because they both live in Red Deer. Just thought I'd write about it, even though I have nothing more really to say about it.   i've spoken too soon before. this time, i will remain silent until i know for sure
