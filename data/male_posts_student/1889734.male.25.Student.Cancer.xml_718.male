It only takes a second to look at each end of the rink and get a nod.  Hitting the post is nothing to get excited over.  You missed the net, you didn't beat the goalie.  Had the shot been on net, it would have been stopped.  My job description says nothing about protecting the posts.  When the other team is dancing around the boards, don't just stare at them.  Make them make the play.  They're not all Wayne Gretzky.  Most of them will screw up under pressure.  Go get 'em.  If you're on my team and standing in the slot, you better not be watching the puck.  There are enemy skaters in need of molestation.  More if I think about it....
