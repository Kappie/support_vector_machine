First, we hear that evil Halliburton is reaping vast rewards from the machinations of Cheney.  They are making windfall profits on no-bid contracts, and making out on the blood of our soldiers in Iraq.  Now the truth comes out, and we find that Halliburton is actually having some trouble.  Their financial performance is sub-par, and in some projects, they are bleeding cash.  So the critics take a new tack - Halliburton's woes are evidence of Cheney's incompetance!  How convenient!  Amazing how the facts can easily be mutated to support the premise the Cheney is either evil or incompetent.  The plasticity of the Left is an amazing thing to behold.
