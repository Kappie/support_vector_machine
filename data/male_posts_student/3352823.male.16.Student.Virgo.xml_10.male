Anyone know what happened two years ago today? " Star Wars - Episode II: Attack of the Clones " was released. Woo! Wow.. I have nothing to report. RE: "All The World's Ablaze" Hopefully I can get a lot of people to start reading it. I know the first episode wasn't all that brilliant... It's just an introduction to Ron I suppose. Hm. Oh, and feel free (to say no? haha) to leave comments. In fact... I urge you all to do it! Do it... Especially tell me how ATWAB is going so I can figure out what to do. Ooh and suggest storylines?  Is that it?  I think so... More later.
