LOL!  Well anyway, I hope everyone spent Easter relaxed and in company of their loved ones, eventhough I didn't have the chance to spend it with my loved  one ... Nope, I'm definitely not counting my family as they tend to get on my nerves asking all sorts of retarded and boring questions... Now all of a sudden they give a damn 'bout how I'm doing in life... riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight...  Honey, nei, I can't tell you how much I miss you! ...can't wait to see you soon! :*  ...oh, 2all, remind me to get a bumper-sticker, saying: "It wasn't me!" ;)
