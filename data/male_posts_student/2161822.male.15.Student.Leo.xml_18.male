At least when it comes to the internet. Anyway, today we had a half day. This week was cool since Tuesday we didn't have school. It's almost Thanksgiving break too. I always thought Theology class was an easy class. An easy 100. I mean last year we did work for the first 15 minutes of class then had the rest of the period to goof around. Plus, we had mostly open book tests and are exam was open-notebook-work-with-a-partner. This year it's more like work all period, hard tests, lots of notes...etc. Theology isn't supposed to be hard. Chemistry is ridiculous. I mean, it's hard enough even when I know what I'm doing and he teaches the material well. But it's even harder when he doesn't teach. His method of teaching lately has been to give us a problem on the new material and say "Here do this." I hate that man. End post.  Listen to H.I.M.
