The Croatians took the lead early in second half after two goals in 4 minutes, returning from an own goal by unlucky man Igor Tudor. Then 12 minutes later Trezeguet scored the equalizer, but only after a great deal of help from his left hand. Surely, that goal should have been called off. In stoppage time, the Croatians had the chance to get all the three points from this match but Mornar kicked the ball just over from close range.  My Man of the Match: Dado Prso.
