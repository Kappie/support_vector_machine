Maybe, just maybe, I will be able to run it on this machine.  With a good framerate.  Don't tell anyone, I may become the target of assasination.  I decided to reset my sleep schedule so I can actually get to bed at an hour that humans here normally do. To do so I embarked on a journey to completely screw my sleep pattern up. By staying awake all night, this I have accomplished. I may be kind of an asshole today. Ok, a really big asshole. But tonight I'm going to be tired. Tired like I haven't been in ages. And then I can go to bed.  Early.   I've been playing BFV, BF1942, C Generals, the Ground Control Demo, and the Joint Ops demo. If the graphics become particularly impressive I will hook you guys up with some screenshots. I think you'll get a few from Halo. I will be writing that Ground Control Demo review today as well. I like only working on Fridays and Saturdays, but damn it gets boring. Be back later! (I apologise in advance for all the assholishness that may ensue.)
