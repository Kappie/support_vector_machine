It's only two feet high... and there's a ramp on it with hinges, so it folds up... tomorrow [if I'm not lazy] will be time to make the mini-quarter pipe, I'm babysitting right now... and theres a three person4 through 7 year old battle going on in my house.... so I'll update next time anything happens. Later.
