Even though most of the employees suck, there are a few that are very cool. Following the Chain of Command: first, on top of the visible food chain, there is Nancy. She owns the place along with Rick. A very nice lady, even though she does have some crazy ideas (like me fighting with Sandy for the break-till). Then there is Lazy Louis. Here's a guy who tells us about his run ins with the Federalis in Mexico. Who knows what would happen if Nancy made  him  take a drug test. After Louis, we have the real brains of the DQ: Sandy. Actually, Sandy is not only the brains, she is also the brawn. With her fearsome gaze that has been known to turn people to stone, she strikes fear into the heart of all. After Sandy is Janelle. Janelle scares me. She likes to do work a lot. Following Janelle there is Eric. Eric is probably the coolest kid (besides Josh and I) that works there. Following Eric it is Josh and myself. After us, the employees go to shit for the most part. Some of them are ok, but most of them are just crazy girls who cant do anything right and do way to many drugs. Those are the employees in a nutshell.  As Josh mentioned, I saw Spiderman 2 at the 12:01 showing. It was a little better than the first one. Too bad Bruce Campbell wasn't Doctor Octavius. It would have been immensly better if he had. We can only hope that Spiderman 3 has  two  bad guys.  In other Brainerd news, Battle of the Bands is tomorrow. Although I am going there with the expectation that most of the bands will suck, I am still going. I want to go there to see people I know playing, like Schilling, if his band made it. Schilling playing a Bass... What a funny thought. If Schillings band is there, I am going to throw many somethings at them because they will suck, badly. Joe Day and the Normans (???) may also be there. I know that at the end of school Joe was talking about being in Battle of the Bands.   The Fourth of July is on Sunday, and I have to work. I have to work from nine to four. Hopefully, I can find a relatively easy job to do. After work, I'm gonna go to the fireworks. Good plan.
