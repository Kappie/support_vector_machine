ITS OVER!! but damn.. cos i wont be seeing some of the j2s nemore.. feel kinda sad.. had lots of fun together especially during outtings.. and yes *ahem* someone won't be going back for many practices. And then of course the terms are coming, can't really say how i feel about it.. haven't even started studying other than going for some remedial lessons.. theres this foreboding sense in me that im gonna screw my exams up again like all others.. just because i dont FEEL like studying.   Well.. maybe to brighten myself up i could recount the entire day yesterday.. it WAS rather enjoyable.. well first.. was the woooorst part of the day - i couldnt wake up! stared at the alarm clock half in dreamland for 2 agonising hours before i finally dragged my fat ass out of bed.. and booyy was it good.. i had been practising long and hard and finally i could show what i could do! Ahh.. damn them all.. they think i'm supposed to turn into some trombone god over a nice ''long'' period of 3 months.. bah! what do they know. with that thought conveniently flushed out of me, i proceeded to realise.. it was 10! omg! i was supposed to meet the trumpets euphoss and trombones at 11:30.. i was sooo screwed! rushing like mad.. i realised.. ITS ONLY 9! omg.. i must be pajiao or something.. turned and took a good second look and realised.. PARALLAX ERRROR... Dooots! haha.. pathethic huh? Well decided against my better judgement to practice the trombone.. just a little.. was forewarned over msn last night by someone that it would affect my embrouchre.. but ahhh what the heck.. i dont have a proper one for trombone anyway.. lol. Well.. skipping how i walked to the bus stop and took the bus.. i was on my way to the MRT.. and guess who i saw.. someone from band i didn't really know! ahha! That only means one thing.. lame time! but dammit that womans hard to handle.. her names jennifer.. j2 flute player.. quite pro from what i hear during practice. I realised that shes actually a nice and quite chatty person.. and mentally slapped myself for not taking initiative to 'bond' with more people in band. We went to jurong.. where we decided.. since it was only 11:00 that we should be ''fashionably late''.. well actually.. we just knew no one would be there on time.. so what the heck! =) she thinks like me! haha! Met a few others at jurong itself then made our way to come in at a decent 20 minutes later!   Well yeah she was there.. but so was her he. Lol. the problem being that hes my friend too.. gay. Understanding what i just said is not of primary importance her.. just to understand that.. life sucks! But there was something.. we were wearing the same brand name.. Billaabonnng! wow congrats david! bet you're the only IDIOT who noticed that. Well.. ANYWAY.. we went allll the way to eat at the famous and very fine restaurant of McDonalds! Hot damn it was crowded.. with us and our instruments.. its really unfair how i am the only one lugging around the mother of bulky craps.. NO the tubas arent counted cos they're all on the lorry! unfair! Bah.. at least i didnt actually HIT anyone.. a credit to my negotiation skills with my case. *grins* You know i realise how either  a)innocent b)sick c)just like me D)NUTS  she really is.. the first thing about a huge bird statue she notices is the a**hole! lol! understandably we DID approach it from behind (not in that way hor!) so the first distinguishing feature that separates it from other monuments of avians is the gigantic GAPING hole in its rear! lol! ha.. it was a long enjoyable lunch.. talking to john and johnathan.. two fun guys i've come to regard as good friends since i came to acjc.. and band. Well.. it was time to head for the concert hall itself.. and we took a few fun photos there before we got some warmup then to eat.. again! haa yesterday was foodfest i swear.. i ate a shizzload.. sinful! =X sadly not everyone was catered for so i headed over to mcdonalds fine restaurant AGAIN.. but this time i didnt eat anything.. really.. just accompanied a friend.. marco. Doesn't know if it was appreciated but it doesnt matter.. friends dont stand on ceremony with each other.. take advantage of that while u can!  Then finally.. it was the big thing! Had fun in the guys dressing room with several deranged people who i believe just recently escaped the boys home and somehow got their hands on saxophones to create.. wonderful music! i love that.. i must be deprived not to know that they were playing final fantasy... chocobo's theme or something like that. Well.. after that.. it was the concert! can't say i was really nervous.. i had been to too many concerts to feel to have a case of nerves.. the only thing really nagging me was my section.. they had high expectations of the entire section as a whole.. and even if i felt i wasn't good enough, they probably did.. and i didn't want to let them down. Besides getting a tight fit in the blazer (like whats new?) i felt i was ready to play my best! by the way.. the mcs looked great! haha!  Ah.. the performance came and went.. thudnerous applause sounded.. and it was over! we did it! tien tee never looked so happy.. lol! after all the trauma he caused to the children in the audience wearing those little ''gifts'' for each song the j2 exco gave him.. at least we pleased him! no more '' your intonation sucked.. play in tune please''.. but instead.. '' well done guys!'' ah.. that was REAL music to my ears..  After the success, a large group of us including jian xiang qizhen yong thieng james dominic david and jun ming went to KAP.. and it was the lamest ever time on earth.. really! they procalaimed the restaurant to be closed.. and we had to order from the drive-in.. queueing with the cars! hahaha never had such an experience but we had a good time laughing it out.. after which i returned home exhausted.. thinking.. mission accomplished. but with also the realization that.. I HAD LIT TOMORROW! dang.. fairytale just got headshotttttteeeed!  I will never forget this day.. i won't see many people that often anymore, friends will always be friends however, and if any of them really do regard a friendship seriously.. it will blossom.. until then.. all you who i might not see anymore, health and luck especially in ur 'A's' and have fun! life isn't only band! =)
