When I woke up, I felt terribly terrible. My throat is all clammed up and inflammed. Ergh!!! So horrible! After I forced myself to vomit, I found out that it was phlegm stuck in my throat. My throat felt better, but not really that better. I got a bad bad cold though....Ergh!!!  Dad came home at 10+, and we set off. My brother did not come with us though, he's down with the flu. Poor thing. First place we went to is my paternal grandmother's place. I hate going there lor. Not because of my grandmum. Things are always quiet there lor. No real conversations one. Hate it. I got two hongbaos there. $6 each from Dai Ku Ma (eldest aunt) and grandma.   After that, we went to Bak Liong's house. She's my auntie (paternal side). There is much more livelier, and got my favorite cousin, Felicia. HaHa. There's more talk there and I enjoy it lor. HaHa. Bak Liong gave me $8. O.o!!!   We went to Whampoa to eat lunch. I ate vegetarian hor fun. I just had the luck to sit behind a group of smokers. The smoke avaggrated my runny nose! Idiots! A whole bunch of idiots! I had a very unpleasant time there.  After that, we went to Chun Dao He Pan. We always go there during CNY. It's a tradition. We took pictures, as usual. I posed with the 12 animals of the zodiac and the attractions of the park. This time, the wishing well's bell got bigger and easier to hit. Heh heh. Sure had a lot of fun 'wishing'. This year, there are more shops than usual. There's lesser attractions too. So meowful!  After that, we went to my maternal grandmother's house. O.o She got a DVD recorder and a LCD TV. Mother was so fascinated over them. HaHa. We chatted and ate. I ate a lot of things leh, after visitng 3 homes. Heh heh. Oh yes, Grandmother gave me $12, as usual.   I came back le...oh god. I don't wanna go on le lar...I feel so weak all over. Let me say that total I got from today (plus parents) is $66. I am getting more, of course. Now, Wendy placed a order on me to go rest, or else cannot go her house play mahjong. HaHa.   Okay okay. I end le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
