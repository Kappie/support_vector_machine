I needed to catch up, but these things happen, and no children or small automobiles were injured in the process. I finally cracked open "Dude, Where's My Country?" by Michael Moore, which was lent to me by a coworker. I suppose after seeing Fahrenheit 9/11, I was still curious, though I'm fairly convinced that the material within will be mostly the same.  There will be a shopping extravaganza this weekend, the likes of which have not been seen at Park City in many an age. I need some new friggin' (that's the second time I've used that word) clothes. I'm told I should invest in some colors this time around, or at least more than my occasional  dark  greens and  dark  blues. What can I say? I've never been inspired to put on orange! Well, maybe once.....  I heard from the Lancaster Hospice. Did I already talk to you about this? Well anyway, here's a quick update. Apparently, if I'm chosen for this position, I'll be traveling to Boston for  two  days (the length of time spent in Boston keeps shrinking, dammit) for training, and then would return home here and visit the homes of people who have received bereavement counseling already to administer some sort of interview/assessment to see if said counseling was helpful. The best part? This might be able to roll over into a practicum in the Spring. Now that's as cool as sharp cheddar cheese.  Here's what stinks. It's August already, and the summer, while feeling quite long during June and July, is beginning to seem accelerated. Still, I'm not dreaded going back to school anymore, which is nice. I think this break may have been just what I needed to get me back into the swing of things and give me enough steam to push on through until the end (which is looking more and more like it will be next summer).  I think, like, eight people recognized me at the mall yesterday. Now I'm not saying it was for good reasons, but still, it was sort of spooky. We've got quite a culture underneath that strange, tent-shaped ceiling. (shudder)  So I got up early today (early being 10 am) specifically for the purposes of going running before work. And then, as I was shifting around and pushing off my covers, I felt this pleasant tightness in  every single one of my abs . It was enough. Running can wait until tomorrow morning. Well, and then I sat down and started writing this crazy thing, so I don't even have time now anyway.  :P
