      I went jogging last night, for the first time in months.  I was pretty appalled at how completely exhausted I got and how sore I am today.  I used to be able to jog for a few hours like it was nothing.  I was so tired that I could barely speak to order my soda at the express afterwards.  I'm going to go again tonight and hopefully get back into some sort of shape.   As I was jogging, some guy drove up next to me, leaned out of his truck, and told me I was "going seven."  There is a really great  urlLink interview with Richard Kelly , the guy who wrote/directed Donnie Darko, about that movie, and his amazing-sounding upcoming projects, as well as the possibility of a Donnie Darko : Director's Cut.  Also really cool to hear about the possibility of Terry Gilliam directing a film adaptation of the book  urlLink Good Omens  by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett.  There aren't any movies out currently that I'm dying to see, except maybe Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which I guess I'll have to drive to Jacksonville to see.
