I got really pissed off at them, because they didn't ask for permission to use my kitchen, they made a mess, and were doing unsafe things (like having flammable stuff too close to the stove). I think that's the first dream in a long time, where I really felt pissed off. I'm sensitive about my kitchen...   I have 8 wins, 3 losses, and 4 draws on Chessmaster 9000... I'm working my way up the various computer players.   Last night Naomi, Jon, Derek, and I hung out with Nolan for the first time in years. That guy is funny.   I've got the day off today, but I'm not sure what I want to do. My room could use some cleaning. Maybe I'll do that.   You people should leave comments!    ***
