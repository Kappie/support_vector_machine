It took a week to read and understand the GCSE Biology syllabus.  Ok, my teacher taught me genetics, but f*** all else.  And so I wonder why are GCSEs so regurgitative?  Take Physics, a subject which I quite enjoy.  Yet even the exam reuslts can be reduced to a simple formula:  Common sense + A few equations ----> A* grade in Physics.  The other sciences are not so easy - not only do you have to learn the facts, but the bullshit that goes with them i.e. the way of expressing them.  But once again, I'm sure it could be done by a monkey if he could be arsed enough.  This regurgitative exam-style has even made it to Latin, a subject which I really enjoy.  Simply learn the translation of a Virgil or Pliny passage, and a load of bull that goes with it.  Fortunately, I myself quite enjoy reading them for their content (see previous post about Pliny on football).  But I could quite understand if someone were to hate Latin with a passion.  The same spirit, I am sorry to say has the tips of its slimy tentacles clasped around the edges of my favourite subject - Spanish.  Because we can made educated guesses at the content of the writing paper, we learn 'formulae' in the language, impressive constructions for specific situations.  Fortunately I can't see how those tentacles can get much more than a weak nominal grip on Spanish in the near future, Spanish being a subject without coursework.  My maths teacher described coursework as 'a series of hoops through which we must jump'.  She hit the nail right on the head.  It is quite so ridiculously easy to cheat, and it seems the more hours you put into it the easier it will be.  Now how about a GCSE for which there is no coursework, for which it is almost impossible to revise, so the only preparation a candidate gets for it is in the exam room itself.  Let us call it, for argument's sake, Intelligence GCSE.  Now I know that intelligence is impossible to define, so an Intelligence GCSE would be impossible.  I am simply using it as an example.  What if all GCSEs were to move a bit more towards intelligence, and away form regurgitaion: not all the way, as the ability to work hard is a virtue and should equally be rewarded.  But employers and universities themselves are saying that it is hard to differentiate between A grade students.  Oxford and Cambridge themselves give us tests at entry, which are very difficult to prepare for (although we will try!).  An Intelligence A-level then.  Good.
