Your theory is I'm acting delirious, seems I'm always havin' fits You sayin' I need to get back to my cheery biz And clearly it's somethin' that I would like I want this to be right, to be settled, I don't have all night But this problem's still in sight, too dark to see the light And it's possible I might not be able to win this fight What am I doing, I'm dazed, confused, I've lost my way I haven't found the words to say for so many days How can I figure out just what to do When I don't have a clue on how to get myself renewed I'd still like a friend I could open up to Still want someone I could tell what's up to Someone who wants to hear everything I do, bad or good Comfort me when I've fallen into one of those crappy moods If not feel, at least act like they're only doin' it cuz they could Maybe I'm blind, maybe there's already someone who would Do that for me, go to bat for me Give me some advice on the this and thats of misery It's bad for me to act so sorry But I'm sad you see, be glad it's not you but me And I would like to know how to turn it around I've been run to the ground not just by leaps but bounds And I haven't made a sound, I'm losing myself quietly Like I'm on a diet see, starving myself from society From feelin' happy, yeah it's not revolutionary But I need my own fairy godmother, someone legendary To help me carry myself back to clarity Wait I'd like to clarify, don't want nobody be surprised I just need to live my life, rid it of this pointless strife And this is the price I paid for the mistakes I made But maybe for all this pain I'll be better for it someday
