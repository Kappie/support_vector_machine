On Friday morning, I woke up and fixed breakfast while mimi gathered some clothes to be washed at her dad's house in lodi. We had to return the Welsh Corgi that was found to the rightful owners later that afternoon. We leave sometime around 11 or 12 and make our way across the Napa Valley and over the Sacramento River delta arriving a couple of hours later. Most of that afternoon we goof 'd around. Mimi and I threw a Frisbee and played with the chickens and other animals. I found a nest full of eggs and road around on a little razor scooter. Darrell(mimi's dad) was waiting on a dish TV guy to come and install their new dish system so we all drove up the road to check out a salmon farm but ended up just tooling around the neighborhood for about 15 minutes and driving back. During that time, the lady came to pick up her dog and she left us 4 - $10 gift cards to chili's. Not bad. Darrell had mention that he wanted to get a large hole in his yard filled so I offered to help. As soon as we arrived back at his house, the dish guy pulls up and I run to grab a shovel. I have been feeling so unproductive this past week that I was really itching to get some work done. I fill up the hole with a little help from mimi in about 15 minutes and got a nice blister on my hand and a sore-as-hell back in the morning. It felt fucking good to use some muscle for a change. It felt good to accomplish something. I think I like yard work. We decided to stay the night so I had a few beers and washed some clothes. Jeremy went over to a friends house so that was the last I saw of him during the weekend. The next day I was up around 9am, I found some cereal in the closet and got the day started with a little sugar and corn. I sat around waiting for Darrell to get his ass out of bed so we could start digging this trench for his new telephone line.  We all had plans to go to this Portuguese Bull Fight that day, and I knew it started at 3pm. I dicked around some more outside, enjoying the semi-country sounds and watching tons of black birds devour a field of grapes that can't be sold. Finally Darrell is up, and he is sitting in the living room talking to mimi and having some coffee. He had told mimi that he was going to put off the trench till Sunday but because I was on his ass about it, he would start it today. GOOD! So after fucking around for nearly an hour, he finally gets outside and we start on the trench. We had an hour before we were to leave so we got a little bit done. I felt very disappointed that the morning had wasted away. Seize the day! The bullfights were amazing. I was a little horrified with the treatment of the animals but the amount of real fucking culture and people and sounds was like a dream.  The music was so amazing, these were real people living their lives like generations before them. I felt like I was in Portugal, the matadors were a sight! Their outfits and manners were so arrogant and proud. I was enamored by the whole event.  After that we went to a small restaurant and eat some REALLY good food. I didn't have to pay for anything, doing a little work for people is always a nice trade. We left that night and made it home just in time to watch some SNL and fall asleep. That night we both slept so well that neither of us woke up till around 11 and that doesn't happen often. Mimi had to run some weekly recap at her store, so I went with here and chatted with my dad on the phone while she worked. I learned that a good friend of my mom's had died the night before and just a few days before that, her uncle died. It's weird how these things come in multiples.  So any ways, we head over to chili's after that to cash in our gift cards for some bean burgers and boy were they good! The chili's was right next to a Home Depot so we ran in and tried to find an air filter for the A/C unit at the condo, no luck, mimi was unsure on the size. I did apply for a job there, it was all on a computer and it took me about 45 minutes to complete. The questions where awful.  When we went home, we crashed out for about 30 minutes and then both agreed to 'groom' our puppy. That took a few hours but we trimmed all of her hair, her nails, and bathed her and treated her for fleas. We found a few while trimming her. She hated us. ha ha. Now she looks and smells a lot better.  Today, I spent most of the day filling out applications. I applied at Zales, Ultra jewelry outlet, VanHuesen, CompUSA, Peir1imports, and Boarders book store. I have interviews already set up with the first three. So it looks like John is going into retail for the time being. I will do whatever it takes, I am sure as hell not scared of lowering my standards. I am still looking for a tech job but it's pretty thin.  peace out.   current mood: accomplished current music: promise ring
