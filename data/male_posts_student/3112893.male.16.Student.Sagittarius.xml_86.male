It was an interesting idea and I got to hear him rant about how he doesn't really like Seymour Papert and that while he agrees with him on a lot of issues, he just doesn't get it beyond a certain point. But, after we got home, it was pretty true to my prediction except that I went to the bathroom and fell asleep briefly in the process so decided that I was too tired to brush. Meh. I did it this morning which wasn't too much later considering that I went to bed at 0400 and woke up at 0954. I didn't really wake up until 1209 though because the first time I was just, like, walking around a bit, brushing my teeth and taking a leak, but again decided that I was too tired to do anything useful so went back to bed. Why would anyone care about what I just said? I have no clue, but I'll leave it up there because, ya know, what if someone DOES want to know about it.  On an unrelated side-note, the cable modem we have here at home just feels so much slower than the T3 we have at the lab. It's like getting off a horse to ride a donkey. Damn, that thing is fast! I'm think I'm just spoiled because I know there are some people in the world who are still on 28.8k* and actually have to wait for news pages to load.  On another entirely unrelated side-note, my cousin, Andres, Peter, whatever you want to call him, asked me a very interesting question once. It's harder than the question that inspired it, which makes it kinda interesting. Here it is: If you're good looking in a forest, but no one's around to see you, are you still good-looking? I dunno how interesting this actually is, but I found it quite interesting because the attribute "good-looking" is defined entirely by the subject looking at it, so, like... yeah. You think about it... if you want.  That is all. -- Feanor  * Andres, don't kill me! I'm too good-looking to die!
