Drew's entry today reminded me how much i love rain!  i dunno.  i hadnt even realized how much i love rain.  i've been too stressed too even notice.  but man rain is awesome.  i love rainy days.  gettin to sit at home and listen to it.  or sittin outside on the porch and listen to it.  oh gosh i love that.  its like...rain is so peaceful.  i wish i could be rain!  that'd be cool.  well not forever of course.  but yeah.  i dunno how im really feeling right now.  kinda blah.  yeah thats it.  blah.  i dunno things right now could get better...or they could get worse.  it just depends.  hence the BLAH!  ok well we shall see what happens.  au revoir.
