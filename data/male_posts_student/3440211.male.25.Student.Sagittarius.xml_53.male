I have had a lot of time to think lately and the decission is made even clearer by al means. I had this time someone head-hunting "sort-of" me. It feels great. Lets see what it end up being. Could be quite interesting.  Lets hope it all turns out for the best. In fact I know things will go well its just a question of time.  Mood: very good... very good.
