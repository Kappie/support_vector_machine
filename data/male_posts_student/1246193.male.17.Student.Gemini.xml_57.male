"You have a choice, but you must pick one.  For the rest of your life, will you be blind or deaf?  Initially I thought I would rather be deaf.  I figured that I would still have plenty of freedoms.  I would still my able to see my family, my surroundings.  I think I would feel more secure.  The changing seasons, the beauty of artwork, they would still be with me.  Silence is peaceful.  It has a calming effect on me and not much else does.  and sitting here, thinking.  I would miss everyone's voices.  If I were blind, communication wouldn't be as much of a problem.  I would miss the music, Vivaldi and Bach to the Beatles.  The harmony in people's singing that sends chills through my spine, would be gone forever. No more piano or violin--two devices which help me to truly express myself.  But If I were blind I wouldn't be able to read any of the music.  They are both much too precious.  I am curious, how would you answer the question?
