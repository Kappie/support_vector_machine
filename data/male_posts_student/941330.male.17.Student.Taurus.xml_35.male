We have cool people on our team. Thi came, Ira and Richard visited...Erik, where were ya?   For such a rich school (all-weather track, fancy photo-finish cameras, loudspeakers) Newark Memorial has crappy bathrooms (no pun intended...uh...yeah). And they ran out of food after 2-ish...very disappointing. I was OK I guess...I stretched for roughly 5 hours per leg cumulative...my start is a little better, I got a 13.7 100 and 64.5 400. Improvement baby. There are some inhumanly fast souls in our world. They even beat 49 from Moreau! Wow. Thi told me about her exciting exploits involving nearly swiping Mr. O a credit card...yes, please don't ask. And because I'm now a track expert and all, "soon" in track (as in, "our event is coming soon") means "in roughly 5 weeks."  We have medalists on our team! Yes...our trusty girls hurdlers -- Jenny, Belinda, Kat and Jennifer (who nobly sacrificed the Chinese school that laid the foundation to their success and fame) -- won gold for shuttle hurdles. Good job guys. They won by a second and a half, which is pretty decent. It was a moment to savor. Then of course when they got their medals from Coach Beller, silly me took a picture of them with the shutter closed. AND that was the last picture on the roll...wasted. Sorry guys. Kat was kinda beat up on the shins, but she got her rightful royal treatment with blankets, ice, food, track bag pillows, bandannas, the works. All we needed was some incense and sacrificial lambs, and we'd be set. Belinda and Loan...and Jason...and Kristen...and Tammy...and David...all schooled me very badly in 13. It's a fun game. I'm just card-stupid.  We did pretty well, considering our greenness. Go Eagles! And all that.
