I woke up early to prepare and cook the dishes for my family members to try it out. It was pretty ok cus nothing burned, so I juz hope it goes the same for tomorrow. Honestly, I'm pretty proud of my accomplishment. Haha, cus I'm not a good cook and I dun usually cook at home. Well, I was pretty tired after the whole thing, but I still had to clean the place up and stuffs.  I tasted my food for lunch and it wasn't bad at all, surprisingly. Haha, i rest a little while in the noon before heading off to gamble. L0L! I did earn some cash, but it wasn't alot, so it was kindda disappointing. Haha, but I suppose tt it's betta than nothing.  I juz finished doing 3 menu cards for my cooking practical tomorrow. 1 for me, 1 for the lil' pig and 1 for the fat pussy cat. They're so mean! Force me to do it! Hmmph! So therefore both of them owe me a treat at Starbucks! Hehehe, I'm so tired now, I'm like half asleep. Well, I guess I betta haf an early nite. The big day's tomorrow. L0L! Big day sounds like a wedding of some sort. Well, guess I'll end here, too tired to continue. Shawny OUT! =]
