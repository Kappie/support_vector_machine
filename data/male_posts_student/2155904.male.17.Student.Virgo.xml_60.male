He got up and found out he had the 2 hour delay and that was great.  But the odd thing is that he had woken up at 6:08 on his own and he woke up from this dream.  In his dream he basically went through Thursday as if there was no school.  So he was all in no-school mode.  Then he woke up.  And since he had just been dreaming he thought it was no school that day.  So being the stud that he is, he turned his alarm off and went back to sleep.  Ouch, bad idea.  Luckily 1-2 minutes later when he was almost asleep again he suddenly realized that he didn't actually know if school was cancelled.  Needless to say he got a little freaked.  But he pulled it together and found out what he needed to know.  And then he went back to sleep for a couple of hours which was nice.  The day was awesome cuz he really barely did anything.  1st period was cool cuz he just hung out with Tina and Karla (sorry Karla but Tina always goes first).  So that was cool (more about Tina in a second).  Second period through the rest of the day was good too.  Another great lunch too made it great.  He ended up going to Pie for lunch.  Not his decision but he was certainly fine with the group's decision.  The pizza there is second to none (total lie right there by the way).  But anyway he got through the day and the great pal that Skippy is, he gave Tyke a ride home.  It really was a great car ride.  They haven't had a car ride in a while and this could start sounding homosexual soon and they both are not so Tyke is just gonna skip over this part.  Oh wait, that ending also makes it sound gay.  Damn, well that whole last part could just get deleted but Tyke likes to let everyone know his thoughts unedited.  And this is the truth.  Most of what you read has never been reread or anything.  Grammatical and spelling errors are fixed but other than that it is all just thought up and jotted down.  No joke.  You are reading the uncensored thoughts of a total beefcake.  He doesn't wear Beefy T's though.  Annnnnnyway he got home and just hung out for a while.  He actually did his homework early and then he took out the trash.  Then he left to meet Skippy at JIB just like the old days.  Then they went to the gymnastics meet.  Upon arrival they saw Ekul and Haras' Kram so they went over and talked with them for a good 5+ minutes.  It was cool.  They are good guys of course.  They have to be since they are dating such awesome girls (wink wink nudge nudge tickle tickle).  "tickle tickle???"  WTF does that mean???  Eh, it just came out.  But seriously folks, tonight was cool.  Skippy and Tyke moved back to the Issy cheering section and Haras came so they talked a little and then Purdy came and they talked some too.  Later on Tyke went over to where Purdy, Ekul, Haras, good Kram, and Tina were sitting and sat with them.  That was fun.  Him and Ekul talked and then he went over and sat by Tina cuz all the couples were "coupling."  Don't worry, he didn't hit on her or try to make a move or anything idiotic like that.  But it was sort of different between them for a little while.  It was sorta like Tyke is kinda afraid of her.  He is afraid now of being too "in your face" with her.  He just feels like he can't be around her that often or she is going to get kinda taken aback and kinda not like his advances even though they are not advances.  The odd thing is that he really thinks that he is over her.  Over his insatiable desire to be with her that is.  He still loves her madly but is totally able to control it.  He is not in love with bad Kram though.  He really doesn't like him.  He is too...eh, don't know what the word is...grrrrrr will have to suffice.  He is just too grrrrrr.  He is not a good guy for her in Tyke's eyes.  And other people's eyes too apparently.  She deserves someone who will treat her like a little angel cuz that is totally what she is.  So angelic and sweet.  And she can be quite innocent too.  But enough of this lovefest.  Tyke wants to get this thing wrapped up so it can get published for the world to view.  Thats right!  The world!!!
