And considering that electrical stuff around here is crap, it was not surprising. The rain didn't stop pouring for hours and hours. Wonderful huh?   Thomas, aka: Tom-bosis, is over right now describing some "wonderful" things he did when he was working in a spinal cord injury clinic. These are stories to hear in person ;)   Anyhow, I guess no one has come up with an answer to the question I posted in that previous post. Here's another link to try out some (very easy) forensic examination questions:  urlLink http://health.discovery.com/fansites/drg/quiz/quiz.html    Enjoy!   P.S. JL......boooooooo! You know why :( j/k
