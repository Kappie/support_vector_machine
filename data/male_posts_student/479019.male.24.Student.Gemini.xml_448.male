       
      Work was busy for the first 2.5 hours... but the last 1.5 was boring. Afterwards I dropped of an old car battery at K-Mart to get a deposit back for my mom's car and then went to the new Albertson's on Jeffrey to pick up pictures and groceries. I was so needing stuff to cook. I feel so unhealthy eating like I was. Junk food at work and at home... bleh.. I'm such a health nut after living on my own. I'm gonna be making some seafood pasta tomorrow too. I wonder if I should invite some friends over to join me?  Now playing  Rancid 's "Salvation" from  Let's Go ... that reminds me that I want to get cracking on my papers.  ***
