This isnt summer but its still something thats gonna damage my mind for a while. August 11, 2003. My dad ask me to clean up the backyard before my first day of school. So i clean, not good enough, So i clean, not good enough,So i clean, not good enough,So i clean, not good enough, finally he loses it and starts yelling at me. "OMFG do i have to fuckin point out every single fucking peice of trash out there." So he takes my neck and pushes it agaisnt the window and also raising me in the air. (i have asthma) I couldnt really breathe so im kicking and trying to shout and my mom and brother come. Thier all yelling at him to put me down so he does but throws me to the ground. -Dont get me wrong. Well not me, My dad-he a good guy. or i wouldnt have shelter, food, clothes, computer, Handspring, alot. This kinda stuff has only happened 3 times. -And sometimes dad doesnt talk very much so alot builds up-. OK... the was the sencond time. The first...  I guess my mom and dad were argueing and they started to fight and mom pulled me into the car and called police and dad was arrested. Thats all i remember. I was young.   But guys, this third one could ruin us... they might get divorced. My dad and mom were yelling and shouting while i was getting directions to a party. I said hold on... ill call u back. and i find my mom and dad fighting for real for first time.My dad had my mom  on ground. Wait...ill leave off right here and talk the rest because im getting tired and i want to finsih this. (but for those who cant listen) I ran and called police, my dad stopped me by takeing the phone. My mom said. Were done. i cant take this anymore. were through. So she tried getting her shoes but it broke out into another fight and then my dad got arrested and he was taken. My sister (had) to bail him and take him somewhere else. So for the rest of the summer im dadless. o well.  Soo. Im tired. Ill be on lata. Like later today because its 3:57 AM and ill probaly be back in 7 hours. hehe. Bye
