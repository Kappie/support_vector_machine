I live wall to wall with some strange persons I started to think when I after a, somewhat confusing, "thud thud thud thud"-sound got surprised and scared by a "aaahhhhhhhhh"-sound. This "aaahhhhhhhhh"-sound was not a scream, it was more like a long tired sound belonging to some unknown animal from southern Timbuktu, or outer space. I immediately thought they had a secret restaurant which only served to be extinct animals (yes the clock was 4:30 am and yes I was most certainly making strange conclusions) - I saw this somewhat crappy Mafia film where this occurred. Anyway, I changed my mind when remembering the strange thud-sounds - OH MY GOD ARE THEY BEATING THEM?! (Wasn't that tired) - and thus concluded that they are a lot stranger than I am and do have more peculiar hobbies. I now got back to trying to fall asleep, which is hard when you're me, but of course something even more frightening was going to happen. The scream of death. It was like "AHHHHHHHHH" and so loud it could have been some hungry monster under my bed (thank God it wasn't). It made me jump like half a meter straight up in the air (thank God my bed is soft) and after that it took like ten minutes to recover from the awful experience. Actually I still haven't recovered... I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO?! WHAT IF SOMEONE DIED?! Ok, maybe I still have my sanity, but I will never again ask them for anything! I'm probably better of not knowing what happened, though whatever did happen - dead human, dead animal... - it was bad. Evil lurks in every corner of that house, I tell you! Bad neighbors must be the worst invention since the sheep.
