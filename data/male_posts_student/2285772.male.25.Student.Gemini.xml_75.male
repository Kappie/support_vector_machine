I spend too much time raiding windmills We go side by side Laughing until it’s right  There’s something that you won’t show Waiting where the light goes Take the darkest hour-break it open Water to repair what we have broken  There’s something that you won’t show Waiting where the light goes And anyway the wind blows It’s all worth waiting for  Pull on the borders to lighten the load Tell all the passengers we’re going home  I spend too much time seeking shelter World without end couldn’t hold her  There’s something that you won’t show Waiting where the light goes And anyway the wind blows It’s all worth waiting for Anyway the wind blows
