Now, I'm a Roman Catholic, and while I consider myself to be a reasonably devout follower of my faith, I would be lying to myself if I didn't acknowledge my faults.  For example, I do not attend Mass every Sunday.  I have a deep-seated hatred of my father.  Both of these are considered to be sinful, and you know the rest of the story.  When you really get down to it, these things exclude me from accepting communion, unless I've just went to confession.  I have clear faults.  Why should gay activists and pro-choice/pro-gay marriage politicians be denied the Eucharist and not me?  Perhaps church officials might spin it into terms of a politician helping a sin proliferate.  While understandable, the fact of the matter is that there are rogue bishops now authorizing the Eucharist to be used as a political weapon.  Besides any biblical objections there may be (and they're there, basically God is a god of tolerance, but I'm too lazy to look up verses :), these Catholics refuse to acknowledge that we live in a world of diversified beliefs.  In our political system, there ought to be an impartial system of logic that is derived not from what you believe the nature of existence to be, but from what is most just for a society.  Enter my Lincoln-Douglas debate experience!  A while ago, using my rudimentary philosophical knowledge, I wrote this:  "There has been an unnegligible amount of talk recently concerning homosexuality. I would like to have my say. First, for reiteration, the Christian conception of God loves homosexuals like anyone else, but the sin of homosexuality is not to be tolerated. Now that brings us to an important question: can the United States government legislate such morality by banning homosexual marriages?   In order to answer this question, one must understand what our country is based on. The Declaration of Independence calls for the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It's common knowledge that this was taken from English philosopher John Locke, who called for universal rights of life, liberty, and property. Locke is perhaps best known for the Social Contract. In the Social Contract, citizens give up some rights to have their most important rights insured. Therefore, in Locke's eyes, for a government to be legitimate, a government must uphold its society's rights of life, liberty, and property, above all others.   Liberty is the right that must be examined today. Locke put it like this: "My fist stops at your face." Essentially, a government acting morally would allow anybody to do anything as long as other people's rights were not infringed upon. The principle goes further; if John Doe bombs the Capitol building in Washington, that interferes with societal welfare which must also be upheld. While that model is not completely correct, it works for our purposes.   So, should United States citizens have the right to enter a homosexual marriage? At this point in time, the answer is yes; however, that answer can change. For it to change, opponents of homosexual marriage must provide empirical evidence that concludes homosexual marriage hurts society. After all, for a government to remain legitimate and moral, it ought to prohibit activities that interfere with other individuals liberty and/or societal welfare. This could be done with a multidecade long study on the effects of homosexual marriage in a society. Until such a credited study exists, for the United States government to remain moral, it must allow homosexual marriage."  ~  Adapt that idea to any issue of moral interest, I say.  I am of the opinion that the above formula is the most just formula.  Questions, anybody?
