Given that my mind is preoccupied with this, it might explain my train of thought.........  Why is it that for most of us we have our life plan from the time we are 10 ? my grade school education was pushed by my parents with the motto "make straight A's" Why ? because with good grades you get into a good college......now you gotta make good grades in college ....why ? cause good grades in college get you a good job or more likely admission into a good graduate school....now make good grades here too.....why ? so you get a good job......why a good job ? good job makes more money .....why more money ? because more money makes it easier to get married......  This is the plan that i have been taught and that i have been trying to follow since i was little.....i just have my doubts as to why this plan is the plan that i am supposed to follow or anyone else.....i mean for me i know that i have to be married before im 30, preferably when im like 25 or something.......and i have to have a good job....no mcdonalds jobs for me......not that i would want to.......but you get my point, lawyer, doctor, engineer, businessman......not exactly any options outside of that.....you know, no construction worker, police officer, teacher, or college professor.....no those jobs arent respectable enough, well they are respectable but they dont make enough money for people to give those jobs respect.....especially people from a desi culture (pakistani/indian) .... but even before all the career stuff how about finding yourself ? oh wait, ive talked about this before.....well my point is that i dont think this track is necessarily the one that everyone has to follow, or that i have to follow....  my uncle once said no one should get married before they are 35, now to be honest i dont agree with that idea but he had a point : most of us are not mature enough in our mid twenties to be married...myself included, granted ive wanted to get married since i was 11 and even more so after i was 21 but i am a great example of this point.....i dont think i was ready to get married....not because i didnt want to but because there was still alot of growing i had to do........but there is no way i can get around this problem so to speak....i still have to get married when my parents tell me to...if i want to maintain a good relationship with them.....thats the messed up part......its almost like a veiled threat, i have to do what they say, or they are gonna be so upset with me that my relationship with them will suffer......be it that i want to get married when they do not want me to, in which case they wont come to my wedding.....or if i dont want to get married when they tell me to they will make my life miserable by driving me nuts about it every chance they get....not only that, anyone who feels that they need to talk some sense into me will tell me about how i have to get married at some point and its a major part of life and blah blah blah.....  ***now im not saying i dont want to get married...i do, but i want to get married on my terms, on my schedule, not the schedule my parents lay out or that society lays out....i think im entitled to that...last time i checked i am an individual with my own mind....... im not a soulless robot that follows orders ***  yet it seems that lots of people want me to be just that.....just do what im told and not argue, do what im told and just have someone else decide for me what is better for my life.........and whats the worst thing about it all ? im too stuck in this hole to find a way out....at least not without messing up a lot things.......
