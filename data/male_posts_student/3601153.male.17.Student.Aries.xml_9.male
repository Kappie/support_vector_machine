Yep, your over- assured and over-confident posturing about being the best was not just that.  I wish I had decided to join the corps this year... Damn... and of course, you can all blame Mike for the big win  (I am big Cookie Monster fan) .   I went to Clark College today to register for Fall quarter classes. I feel somewhat lucky as I got all the classes that I wanted. I am only taking three hours of classes early in the morning and have the rest of the day off... and I will still get more high school credits than the regular 6-hr day. I am somewhat scratching out a schedule/plan hoping I will be able to get an associates degree by HS graduation. Free college is sweet... go Running Start.  I bought the 9/11 Commission Report. I have been reading the PDF version but got sick of it and decided I definitley prefer the tangible 'sit wherever ya want' version. This is probably the only interesting and actually-readable report that a commission has ever concocted... very, very worth while.  Tommorrow I go to the Clark County Fair to visit and help my friend with her pig exhibiting... that and I have been  lusting  for Fair food for about a year now. The destruction derby is also good for destroying summer boredom.
