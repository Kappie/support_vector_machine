Alot of chillen, good times, and just memories....it sucks that more than half of the people i'm chilling with are going.  that includes some of my best freinds, and even my g/f, which sucks tremendous balls.  I know we have it off "better" than Caroline and jones, but still...it dosn't take away from the fact that she's about 45 minutes away..shit, my fucking car can't even go down the street with out some kind of problem.  But hopefully she'll wanna continue on with the relationship while she's in college...or atleast try it.  My biggest worry if that she finds some "uber-hot" actor or whatever, and just leaves my out in the cold....ya, that would suck BIG time...major ouch right there.  But whatever. I've yet to talk to her about it, and i really should. Maybe on friday, but it should be before...and it definitly shouldn't be after, so we'll see.  Schedule goes as follows: Today, rob called to get a nice game of poker going, which is awsome, cause we never (ever) got together to play poker for any reason.  We've all playhed it before, just never centered a whole gathering for it.  So yeah, that might happen today.  Thrusday: i have no fucking clue.  I would love to be with lilia that day, but i have no idea what she's gonna be doing.  Shit, i don't even know what i'm gonna be doing! I gotta go to Shop Rite (more below) but thats about it, so we'll see what happens.  I know the Guy have cigars...maybe i'll just get one, and we can initiate some male bonding....2 of our own are leaving.  Well, czank is the worse, like some 6 hours...benny is like 30 minutes...so yea.   Friday: BBQ at lilia's.  Appernetly her and Czank planned it out. There's suppose to be all of us there, and it's the last party she's gonna have in that house, so we gotta make sure it's gonna rock.  One thing i love is how both our groups are tied together in more than one way.  I think thats how everyone got along SoOOoO quickly.  But i love it.  In past years the Krew and i have always wondered, if any, were the kinds of girls that would mesh well with our "krewness".  The closest we EVER got was the twins, and christiansen.  But now look at it.  It seems that whether it be our g/f's, or thier sisters, or there freinds, they all come together with ours. lol, it's acutally quite crazy when u think about it.  But w/e, friday calls for a big celebration, new names on the freinds list, and an appologies (memories.....but shit, ya, we gotta go do that!). But ya, definitely looking foward to friday.  Saturday: me, lil, jones, and caroline are suppose to go out for lunch at this fancy casi de sesame street or something for lunch, and then were all apprently gonna go to the city, and just chill. (it's cause it makes a month i was going with lil, and same goes for jones and caroline...plus caroline wanted to double anway...) I have no idea how this is going to work out, considering us guys (me and jones) are suppose to pay, and i have a total balance of 5 cents in my wallet...and we've been strapped for cash cause of the vacation, so i'm prolly gonna get alittel, if anything, from my parents, and shop rite (more below) dosn't start for a good time.  But we'll see.  I'm having doubts again....why do i have to be the insecure one dammit?!?! i hate this role reversal.....   Sunday: This is the acutal day it's a month, but people are..."busy"...wanna know why?! (yea!) alrighty then...  All i know is that i have no idea what i'm gonna be doing. Caroline has a talk at antioch that night, so thats awsome, and thats about all i know.  We were gonna go out that night instead of sat., but to many things were gonna happen....  1. Let's say we did have dinner on sunday, we couldn't, cause we would have to have it early, cause we'd have to come back for carolines talk,a nd early dinner is basically lunch! 2. We couldn't have it after cause it;s sundays, and everything will be closed 3. caroline and jones are both leaving to their respectful trips, so they couldn't stay out late anyway....plus, they gotta say goodbye to each other..in thier own special way...  so there ya have it!  About shop rite...basically, i got the job, i just gotta wait awhile....like, 2 weeks...it's all good though, atleast i got it...  and well, some recent updates..i'm going to lilia's to heplp her pack up some shit...should be intresting.....   well, i'm tired now, so i'm heading out...  toodles, steve
