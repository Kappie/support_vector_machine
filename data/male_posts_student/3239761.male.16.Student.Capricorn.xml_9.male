Things to remember: -Never attempt to (rescue) a wild cat by grabbing it by the neck and trying to wrestle it to the ground to put iodine on its gash. -Cat's teeth are large, they will hurt, and  you   will be needing the iodine and peroxide afterwards. -Wiring a house is easy, finding the live wire is a pain.  I belive I can call this activity "Live Wire Roulette" This comes from my experience of having 2 different outlet boxes with 2 wires in one and 3 in the other.  One wire goes from one box to another, one goes to the light switch above, one is live, and one is a mystery wire... You have to strip each one and wire it to the outlet, with a non-insulated utility knife.  Take your pick, which wire first.  You will know when you find the hot one, electrical burns are nothing. -Shoveling for two hours is not a good thing, neither are the calices and blisters that form from such activity. -When using a drill with a screw tip for wiring outlets, keep fingers away from end of drill.  When the 5 inch bit slips and you're finger is in the way, you're skin has little chance of survival.  So says my hole in my index finger that oddly looks like a Philips head tip. -Thou shall not pop thine blisters. -Chasing barn cats away from your house cats is ok, speeding off of a newly built wooden bridge is not ok.  Half inch splinters are an unfortunate side-effect.  ~To whom ever is still reading this blog.
