She asked us ( my former class T9) whether we could join her and her church group at sentosa for an outing. at first i couldnt decide whether to go as firstly i doubted that i could get up early enough the next day, my movie ended at midnite and i got home around 0040. we were supposed to meet up at 9 the next day at harbour front. Secondly i dun really noe her church group. In the end i just decided to go, it was an oppurtunity for me to catch up a bit with her and get to see her church group  So i woke rather early and hitched a ride on my parents car to reach dhoby ghuat interchange before taking the train to harbour front.There i saw a lot of ppl waiting, after waiting for a while jing xuan came and introduced me to some of her church friends, who incidentally were the pple gathered at the station. I then realised i was the only one besides her who was from T9.   I met a couple of pple who were all in jx's church group, most of them were in jc's with a few adult leaders i think. The group proceeded to sentosa where the station games started . I was in jing xuan's group together with her fellow track mate jieyun, nayun a tall and muscular acjcian basketballer and yong ming also from acjc. They were friendly and sociable and didnt mind my presence as an outsider. The first game played was the treasure hunt, we scoured all over the beach for items. However the coconut we got got eaten be the other pple. The second game was hydration, basically each group had to finish 7 cans of soft drinks. Our group had only 5 pple but we drank really quickly. Lolx after that we were all like so stuffed with gas  Next was a  game where after burying jing xuan in the sand,i and nayun swam across the little strait to an island and had to guess what they were saying, they drew the letters using their ahem bottoms. I didnt realise they were trying to spell my name. -embarrased-  After lunch i met a guy named amoz whose from catholic high, wow he sure can make ppl laugh, his jokes are lame but funny. We played games like dog and bone and beach volleyball. After that, jingxuan suggested to ride the monorail and we agreed to do so. It was a long ride but we entertained ourselves by talking cock among ourselves and doing lame stuff. Amoz was like the entertainer on board.That was the first time in dunno how many years i rode the monorail. We stopped by bk at the ferry terminal for a quick bite.  Later we got back to the beach just in time for the beautiful sunset. It was really nice to see the sun melt over the horizon. We finally left sentosa at around 1930. I got to really thank jing xuan for this oppurtunity to attend to this outing. She said the outing would be fun and it sure is. It sort of gave me an insight what her church group was like.
