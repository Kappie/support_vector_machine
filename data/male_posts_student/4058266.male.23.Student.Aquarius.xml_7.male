When I'm down in the dumps you are the first person to notice. The first person to listen to what I need to say. The first person to help me realize if I was wrong or right. I just wanted to thank you on paper because you hear it always from my mouth, this time its different. I'm going through a lot right now and I couldn't do it with out your support. Thank you again.    Your loving brother,
