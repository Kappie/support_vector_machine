I wasn't really looking into following any of his shit when i started listening, but when it was through, I figured I should. Basically with this, I can get in better control of my happiness and be happy more often. I'm hoping this can link to my relationships and make me better, and be able to keep friends and stuff, so that I can... be better. Dunno if it's gonna work, but I sure hope it will... then maybe I can have another shot with jenna. At this point I know I've not gotten any better, other than noticing that I fucked up, and that's not gonna help us out, so I figure if I can be somewhat successful with this, that she will be able to give me another shot. I know I don't deserve it really, and that she might be well over me by this point, but I love her, and I need her in my life.      Got a kitten the other day too, named him Doc. Very good cat, and I hope to keep him for a long while. He'll be my bud if nobody else will :P      Went to Quebec today, with Dad Zach Leo and some Roger guy. Was a fun trip, and Leo's gonna take us back up there tomorrow, and we're gonna go to the flea market in St.Zotique. Should be cool. Gonna go boating with him too, which should also be cool.      Didn't call Lindsey yesturday, and I haven't called her today either... I don't specifically know why really. I wanna hang out with her, but she always doesn't want to. And when she wants to, shit screws up. The last two-three times I've called her it always ends up silent anyhow... so I dunno what to do. I'm waiting for something to reer its head in this situation, because I honestly can't figure out what to do with this. We can't hang out, she's moving, so like... it's hard to do anything. I dont wanna get attached, plus the fact that we can hardly keep a date. So... I guess it's done. I'm not gonna call, so unless she does, I have no fuckin clue whats goin on. Dont get me wrong, I wanna call, I wanna hang out, but I can't keep calling and getting her "I dont wanna go out today" thing... it's a let-down every time, and I have nothing to say to her lately so I cant even talk on the phone with her. Actually, I might call her in a bit. I might be back.
