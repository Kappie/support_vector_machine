Every single writing manual I've read from Stephen King's brilliant 'On Writing', David Morrell's (Rambo) ' Lessons from a lifetime on writing' offer the same advice: write about something that really interests you.   I get where they're coming from; my first Creative Writing professor was absolutely riveted by the idea of Indians writing (he acted like I was the first; Rushdie, Roy and Naipaul are obvioulsy chopped liver :) ) so I, being the people-pleaser I am, pandered to him in the worst way, writing the same type of stereotypical garbage I mock most of the time.   Now that I've decided to write my fiction, I'm faced with a different problem: I have two workable ideas, both of which interest me, one based on persona experiences, the other one that affected my State's political history in a big way (and, more important to me, my family's political persuasion). The problem is that I'm leaning toward the second idea since its remoteness makes it easier to focus one(without the debilitating emotional baggage of the first one); however, the first one is way more marketable.      Both stories are 'authentic' where I'm concerned, making my decision all the harder. I'm going to start off by working on parallel plot outlines; maybe that'll help me make up my mind.
