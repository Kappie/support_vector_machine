I've been away long enough that I thought I should register some thoughts here.  For starters, my hockey season is now over.  My first season at SoccerZone, and I managed to reach the semi-finals.  We rushed back from Ohio on Sunday so I could make the 4 PM start time, only to see us go down in ignomious defeat.  Unfortunately, our team only dressed 4 skaters plus me in the goal, while the other side had a full roster of 8 skaters.  At the end of the first half, we were up 9-4.  We ended up losing 13-9, with the last three goals coming in the final 90 seconds.  They just wore us down to nothing and we couldn't keep up with the fresh legs.  Even so, I had a good time with the game, and played fairly well despite the score.  Next season starts in two weeks, and I'll be on the same team.  It was nice that they asked my to come back and wanted to retain me.  There's nothing like praise from one's peers, so I took it in the spirit with which it was intended.
