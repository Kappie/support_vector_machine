To them, going out means driving around for hours whining to each other: - "What are we going to do?" - "I dont know... There's nothing to do..." waaaaaaaah - "uhhh!!! It's an intersection! Which way should I turn??!!" and so on, and so on, ad nauseum... There would be nothing wrong with that if it rarely happened, but it happens pretty often and it always happens the same way. I keep telling them to give up. There's nothing to do in Glen Mills when the sun goes down except hang out, and they don't want to hang out. They're too good for hanging out. So instead they go driving around complaining that there's nothing to do. And God help them if they stop and pull the fuck over and actually go in a store or place of business/gathering or something! So, as usual, we ended up driving around for an hour, winding up circling several parking lots, and not ending up anywhere. I've told them several times and I'll tell them again. They need to give up. Nighttime in Glen Mills sucks. All there is to do is hang out; talk, watch movies or TV. That's it... Or you could leave and go somewhere. But don't leave your house at 9 pm and dillydally wondering what to do when you plan on honoring your 11pm curfew. What the hell is so bad about hanging out? (they’re not the kind of guys that do stuff either. They aren’t the type to hike or go shooting/hunting. They don’t like bowling anymore. They don’t want to bother other people…). Every week they do this. They get in the car and run the same routine expecting some sort of neon-lighted oasis of fun to plop down in the middle of the fucking road and bring them in to end their boredom. They need to get a clue or get creative.  The thing that really pisses me off is that I’m sure as soon as they drop me off they bitch about me like I was the one that ruined the evening.
