We watched Mystery Science Theater 3000: Manos The Hands of Fate. Manos the Hands of Fate has to be the worst movie  EVER!  It's about a family that is driving, their car breaks down, and they're stuck at this hotel who's owner is the devils priest and this dude named Torgo. Torgo is one creepy mofo. His says stuff like,  "I take care of this place while Master's away,"  and  "Master wants you, but Master can't have you."  Plus, he's dressed like a homeless person, and he has pillow underneath the legs of his pants. Tell me thats not weird. And for some reason there's this couple who's having sex in their car and these two cops tell them to stop having sex. This happens multiple times and the same cops bust them. That whole part had nothing to do with the movie.  So, to sum it all up, it was the worst 2 hour movie I had to sit through, and the sad thing is people actually paid to see it in theaters (tisk, tisk). Curse my brother black heart for showing me this movie, but, it's a movie every man has to see. And he was "Passing the tourch" down to me like he did for our other brother. So, show this movie to others, as my brother did to me.
