Remeber the draft that I finally sent out?...today I got about 10 e-mails back saying that there is something wrong with it that should be changed...which I could have done easily until I relized the massive changes that these people have made. Which have brought me here...2 o'clock in the morning writing this post with my last bit of energy...the whole change took me about 4 hours to do, so I have been working from 10 last night till today 2 in the morning...I am tired...but at least it's done. Who knows? Maybe tomorow when I wake up I'll face another 10 e-mails...oh well...this is the part I choose to do and I'm going to stick with it, and all in all, I am the best....or so I think ;)  Well...the life without parents is...so far very nice, I have been serviving and been having some fun, so I guess I am kind of enjoying this.  I never get a break, after all these hard work, I can only sleep for a couple of hours because I am giving a piano lesson 9:30 in the morning...I don't usually do these things this early, but oh well...and in the afternoon, I have worship practice for tomorow and a full day of meeting with the people to discuss the handbook and getting it ready to print...-_-...I am soooo tired...  Anyways...even the coke and coffe is not working on me anymore, so I guess I netter go to bed before I break down...so  Later Days  "I am soooo tired" - Me  Neo
