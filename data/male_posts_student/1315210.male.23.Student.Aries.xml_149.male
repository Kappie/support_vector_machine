NOTE: they used "make love to their wives" but the characters in the movie do not play "Monogamy" but they do play "Monopoly" wif the women of the country as commodity....  which leads me to another thing........anyone ever thought abt how people in ancient times practiced contraception? especially since slavery and prostitution are age old practices......well, i remember reading something abt how they used sheepskin as condoms...........  now we know why they have to start cloning sheep.........  anywayz, i realised that ive been having pimples for at least 9yrs......i cant believe it.........then i decided maybe it's time for me to start another assault on them......so off i went to buy some benzoyl peroxide (i.e. pimple cream) to smack on my face.........and i found out later while surfin thru the net, benzoyl peroxide is also a bleaching agent........considering the amount of it ive dumped on my face, im starting to wonder how much acne michael jackson had more than me......
