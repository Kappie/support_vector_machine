I, being the impatient guy that I am, decided to flip the channel to occupy my time while advertisers had their field day.  Much to my horror, I came across the Teletubbies.  I mean, really.  WHAT are they?  Do they actually do anything?  I sat there completely befuddled as to how such a pointless program is on TV.  I tried contemplating the educational merits, but you see:  1. The Creatures from the Dark Beyond don't even speak English, nor any other potentially useful language.  They speak a hackneyed version of baby talk that would make my 10-month old cousins wave their binkies and holler.  2. They have these strange parallelograms on their stomachs that allow them to view small children's undersides in the water.  Yes, that's what I saw today.  The thought of some gruff, unshaven, beer-gutted 40-year-old-man in the water filming these small children was enough to make me shudder.  3. They have this baby face with rays shooting out of it that serves as the sun.  Does the baby face speak?  No.  Does it change expressions?  No.  Does it contemplate world domination from its high perch?  Probably so.  Stewie Griffin, anyone?  Recently, I have seen  The Ring ,  Jeepers Creepers , and  Final Destination , yet none of them have even come close to the freak-out factor of  Teletubbies .  Most disturbing of all is Tinky-Winky.  Now, there's always been this controversy surrounding this particular creature because he's purple and that's supposed to mean he's gay.  Whatever.  By far, the most disturbing part of this persona is that while the other three are blythe-voiced things that at least give the illusion that they're voiced by children, Tinky Winky is voiced by what sounds like a 37-year-old pedophile.  Imagine my surprise as I heard a man with an obviously deep voice trying to pass it off as a child's as they all began to speak in tongues.  One thing's for sure.  That program, if by some miracle (or perhaps curse) it's still on, will never see the light of day with  my  children, or my children's children, or my children's children's...yeah, you get the point.
