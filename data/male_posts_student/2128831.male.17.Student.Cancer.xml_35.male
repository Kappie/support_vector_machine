I went to the cadaver lab today!  Wootwoot!  OMG, this dead man was like all dissected, sorry, prosected, for they wish to preserve it. So  I got to work the levers to raise him up and I got to touch his aorta that was not squishy it was all hard and stuff (not normal!), and and and and umm….   umm… His butt was all nasty and filled with the alcohol that he was stored in and I had to help turn him over.  His face was all like there with hair and all!  Haha, he had nose hair. Nose hair, nose hair!  He sooo didn’t make me feel the need to throw up, the bus ride though, Begesuss! That man was dangerous; I would have lost my cookies (yes, I had some polish cookies before the dissection) if I had to ride that any more! And then we had a fire drill, it is soooooo chilly, my nipples got hard, Lol, haha it was nipplely!!!  So yeah!
