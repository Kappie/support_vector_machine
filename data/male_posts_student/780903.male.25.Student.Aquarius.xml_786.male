But for a lot of people it is, and I still need another day to fill, so it gets its own hundred words.  If you think the Supreme Court's decisions make sense, you won't after a semester of Con Law.  For every famous case the Supreme Court has heard, about abortion, or affirmative action, or school desegregation, or sodomy, you'll read a dozen others about banning out-of-state milk in plastic (but not cardboard) containers, or whether Maine can keep out foreign bait-fish.  There's a lot of constitutional law out there.  Have fun.
