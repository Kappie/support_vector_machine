Pfizer has taken the time to refute the fallacies in the article.  Pretty cool to work for a company that provides ready made Blog posts.  Hark, Big Drug speaks!  Inaccuracies in Time Magazine Article Addressed – February 6, 2004  The February 2, 2004, issue of Time Magazine featured a cover story titled: “Why We Pay So Much for Drugs” reported by Donald L. Bartlett and James B. Steele. The story explores concerns about pricing and access to medicines in America. The public health and policy issues related to costs and delivery of medicines are both complex and enormously important. Unfortunately, Time chose to tell this story from one point of view. The result is a story riddled with inaccuracies and unsupported claims, several of which Pfizer would like to draw to the attention of Time’s editors and readers here:   TIME:            […] On average, name-brand prescription drugs in Canada cost an estimated 40% less than they do in the U.S. On a trip last November, Clark did even better than that, buying a six-month supply of medications for a little more than $1,000, a cache that she estimates would have cost about $3,000 in Maine for the same drugs.    One of them is Lipitor, the expensive, heavily marketed cholesterol-lowering drug developed by Pfizer. "Lipitor is my biggest savings," Clark says. "For a six-month supply, it's $1,900 in the U.S. I paid $500 [in Canada].” […]   FACT: A spot check of retail prices for Lipitor at pharmacies near Kennebunk, where Mrs. Clark lives, shows that a same six month supply of Lipitor can be purchased for $386-$588 (depending on dosage) without breaking the law.   TIME:            […] Nor does it help the millions of working people not eligible for Medicare coverage. As health-care spending keeps rising, (9.3% in 2002, according to the trade journal Health Affairs, the largest increase in 11 years) and employers tighten their coverage to cut costs, consumers have grown more resentful of what they are paying at the drugstore. While prescriptions represented only 10.5% of total health-care costs in the U.S. in 2002, they amounted to 23% of out-of-pocket costs for the consumer. Americans spent $162.4 billion on prescription drugs in 2002, up from less than $100 billion a decade ago. […]   FACT: Although spending increased 9.3 percent in 2002, the same Health Affairs article cited by Time found that prescription drug spending growth slowed the most. Time failed to note that the cost to consumers, however, is related to changes in coverage. Health Affairs found that while private spending on prescription drugs grew at the same rate in 2001 and 2002, out-of-pocket spending for prescription drugs accelerated by 3.5 percentage points in 2002. At the same time, private health insurance spending slowed by 2.1 percentage points. Still, prescription drug spending still represents about 10 percent of all health care spending, just as it did in 1960.   TIME:            […] Actually, pharmaceutical roulette is played every day in the U.S.—with FDA-approved drugs. […] by comparison, the risk from defective, counterfeit or mislabeled drugs from Canada is presumed but unproved by any evidence. […]   FACT: Time ignores a recent series of spot examinations by the FDA of medicines imported by mail into the U.S. The inspections found that drugs entering the United States are often unapproved or counterfeit medicines. According to the FDA, “Of the 1,153 imported drug products examined, the overwhelming majority, 1,019 (88 percent), were [in violation of law] because they contained unapproved drugs. Many of these imported drugs could pose clear safety problems.” (Source: FDA, “FDA/U.S. Customs Import Blitz Exams Reveal Hundreds of Potentially Dangerous Imported Drug Shipments,” press release: September 29, 2003.)   The authors illogically claim that because there are adverse events already in the U.S., importing drugs from Canada poses no additional risk. In reality, even with the FDA-certified current supply in the U.S., only with careful supervision can the right medicine be given to patients safely. Compounding the difficulty with an additional layer of risk is dangerous.   TIME:            […] While the FDA and the drug industry have talked at length about the threat posed by drugs brought in from Canada, what they neglect to mention is this: prescription drugs bought by Americans increasingly are produced in foreign countries with minimal FDA oversight and then shipped to the U.S. […]   FACT: The writers suggest an inconsistency in our position on importing medicines from our own overseas facilities and our position on imports by third-parties from Canada. These two issues are separate and distinct and Time—either by design or oversight—has neglected to address industry and FDA’s real safety concern, which is that Canadian drug imports fall outside the heavily regulated drug supply chains that exist within both countries. FDA and Health Canada have warned repeatedly that neither agency can guarantee the safety of drugs that move between the two countries. In other words, this illegal supply chain is unregulated. As FDA Commissioner Mark McClellan recently said, “It’s when you go outside of the comprehensive safety systems created within the U.S. and Canadian regulatory umbrellas that there are serious safety gaps.” (Speech before Drug Information Association, Ottawa, Canada, November 18, 2003.) A report by Ward Health Strategies found that this gap has opened a market for “drugs making their way from Canadian suppliers to American consumers [that] are of neither Canadian nor American origin.” (“Price Controls, Importation and the Safety of the Drug Supply Chain,” Ward Health Strategies, October 2003)   TIME:            […]For its part, the FDA maintains that all these facilities are perfectly safe, that they have undergone inspections and that their manufacturing processes have been certified as meeting the agency's standards. But while the FDA does indeed inspect plants before opening, after that the oversight trails off. "The FDA has limited resources," an industry consultant told TIME. "The foreign drug-inspection program I don't think is very strong." […]   FACT: Every Pfizer product sold in the United States—regardless of where it is made—adheres to strict FDA standards for manufacturing, packaging, labeling and shipping. Product shipments to the United States from Pfizer’s foreign manufacturing locations are authenticated by FDA officers who work with U.S. Customs. The FDA polices our supply chain by conducting random and unannounced inspections of our manufacturing locations.    TIME:            […] While the industry is quick to claim how much it must spend to come up with new drugs, it is slow to acknowledge the contributions of the Federal Government and American taxpayers. Universities, foundations, researchers and congressional committees have concluded for years that many major drugs owe their origins to research funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Cancer Institute and other public agencies. […]   FACT: In 2003, the entire NIH budget was $27 billion. This covered all kinds of medical research, an extremely small proportion of which may have some role in future drug development and an even smaller proportion of which might have some commercial value. For the same period, U.S. pharmaceutical firms invested more than $33 billion in R alone.   TIME:            […] A report by the Joint Economic Committee of Congress in 2000, then headed by Republican Senator Connie Mack of Florida, summed it up: “The Federal Government, mainly through the NIH, funds about 36% of all U.S. medical research ... Of the 21 most important drugs introduced between 1965 and 1992, 15 were developed using knowledge and techniques from federally funded research.” […]   FACT: This only tells half the story. After the Joint Economic Committee report quoted here was released three years ago, the NIH issued a response (July, 2001) stating that “of the 47 drugs major drugs on the market in 1999, only 4 were developed in part with technologies from NIH funding.” The original study cited in the JEC report stated that for 15 out of 21 “important” drugs, a key enabling discovery was made by publicly funded scientists. However, the same report found that 78 percent of those same drugs were first synthesized by industry scientists.   TIME:            […] “...mostly because of high prices guaranteed by Congress, the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, year in and year out, ranks as the country's richest.” […]   FACT: It is simply untrue that Congress guarantees high prices for pharmaceuticals in the United States. Unlike many developed countries where governments directly or indirectly pervasively fix prices for pharmaceuticals, the United States has generally adhered to the principle that a market economy, and competition in that marketplace, ultimately achieves the best balance of funded innovation, patient access, return to the capital markets, and the other complex variables that govern a high-risk and dynamic industry.   Nevertheless, federal and state governments—and private payers—have undertaken a number of steps to manage the price and utilization of pharmaceuticals. For example, in Medicaid, pharmaceutical companies are required to provide significant rebates and are subject to other forms of price constraint as a condition of participating.
