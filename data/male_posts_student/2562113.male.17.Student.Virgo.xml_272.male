Perhaps its the fact that Jay has realized that in a few short months he will be turning 20 years old which means he is not a teenager anymore.  Which also means he has to stop snowboarding though life with no direction, and perhaps the only way to find direction is to find it yourself no one else can do it.  Self realization is the greatest thing someone can have, you figure that out and life becomes alot easier.  Maybe Jay has realized how to realize and by realizing this he may be on track to realizing himself.  And if he has truly realized himself then he knows that he will never stop realizing new things to realize about himself.     Ok, if you are wondering what the hell is going on i will try to tell you.  The reason I wrote it in third person is because it doesnt apply to just me, it goes for anyone who wishes to realize how to realize.  And if the the whole realizing part is hard to realize then you haven't realized how to realize.  Have fun trying to understand all this because to tell you the truth I have trouble too but that half the game, no one said it would be easy and no one can do it for you  --[SMUT4LIFE]--
