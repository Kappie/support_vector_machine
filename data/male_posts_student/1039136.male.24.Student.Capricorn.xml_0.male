"Our Society" Once upon a time, people believed in respect, marriages were forever, and people actually gave a shit about life in general...that is until about 40 and some odd years ago when our parents were born.  Their generation helped fuck up our generation. Perhaps it was the drugs, perhaps it was the fact that their parents sucked, maybe they wanted to be rebels, who knows?? But I think everyone in my generation will agree that it was our parents who caused our generation to plummet into a moral and ethical downward spiral, as well as making life even harder than it is.  The concept of morality and good in our society is diminishing and maybe thats just party of  some sort of plan?  If you think about it, all of history has been a big wave as far as anything is concerned, and i believe that right now life is reaching the peak of carelessness.  People are becoming more selfish,  less responsible, and not focused enough on whats important; everyone is becoming so focused on "living life to its fullest" that they lose focus on the importance and value of certain things in life.  People take the concept of living life to the fullest, and abusing it.  Sooner or later though,  someone somewhere is going to wake these people up who are living in their dream worlds and bring them back to reality.  Someone HAS to start teaching our generation to make "right" what our parents made "wrong" in our lives...if that doesnt happen, the next generation is going to have to put up with the mistakes our parents made as well as our own, and their lives are going to suck double fold!..remember, only YOU can prevent forrest fires!  "Smoking weed." I know alot of people that bitch at people for smoking marijuana, when really they should be bitching at the people who smoke cigarettes. Weed is a gateway drug, true, but only to the weak. You can probably call Tobacco a gateway drug because people get used to smoking something..they indulge in tobacco, so why not the weed right? Those who smoke cigars already have half of the necessary ingredients to "roll a blunt", so why not get the other half? Everything in life has BAD effects, but people usually ignore the effects in favor of the good results...think about it..You see commercials now for medicine..lets generically call it Med-X. Bla bla bla Med-X has been known to alleviate menstrual cramps in frogs under the age of 20. Med-X is not for everyone. {lower sneaky voice} Med-X in most cases has cause side effects such as deterioration of the liver, anal bleeding, and migraines. Now..if i'm a frog under 20 who has severe menstrual pains, i'm probably going to take that Med-X to get rid of the pain..and ignore the side effects. Call me biased, whatever, but smoking tobacco products has far worse side effects than weed. Plus tobacco products are more accessible than weed, they are legal, and cheaper. People smoke them because they can. You dont get a high or anything from tobacco products...so what the fuck are the benefits? Why smoke them? If youre going to fuck up your lungs why not fuck them up and get something out of the deal. Smoking ciggarettes is like drinking a non alcoholic beer thats high in saturated fat, cholesterol, and carbohydrates..why would you drink that..i mean youre not going to get drunk..just fatter, right? You wouldnt. So whats the point of this opinion that i spouted out about for a good paragraph or so. There is none. Who cares who smokes what unless you dont like either type of smoke.
