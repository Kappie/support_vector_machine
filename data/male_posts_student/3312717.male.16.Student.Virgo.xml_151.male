Today I tried to clean my room, but I decided that I probably would be just sitting around on Monday, and I could clean it then.  Went to  King Arthur  tonight with some people. It was okay.  Well, my dad and Missy are going on vacation somewhere this week, and I am going to hang out with my grandma. Which will be pretty awesome, because my grandma is cool. Pretty much everybody that meets her agrees that she is one of the nicest people ever. She is also really accomodating to my late hours and unwillingness to talk to other people while at home. Here, I have three rules. 1) Take out the garbage 2) Eat dinner with family 3) ....I can't remember what three was. (Maybe don't feed Lilly?) At my grandma's house I expect it will descend into complete anarchy. I view parenting as a mutual partnership between equals, and she does also, so it will go pretty smooth. Plus, I am her favorite grandchild.  Today I bought Jack Kerouac's  On the Road , thinking it would give me some good summer inspiration, and an  Onion  compilation. I have upwards of 15 books on my reading pile, but it has been too damn hot out these last few days to get any serious reading done.  In the news today: More Marines dead in Iraq, Edwards fever is dying down, 'W' Ketchup is launched to combat Heinz Ketchup (something clever from the right! whoa!), and Elvis is high on the charts in Britian. A slow news day, which is appropriate because I try to cut down on the news on Sundays.  The heat makes me nostalgic for last summer, where from 11-4:30 all I did was watch Lupin and complain about the heat. In the day, I just go swimming or go for a drive. At night, all I have to do is blog, read, and listen to music, none of which appeal to me right now.  A plus of being a Night Owl is that you get to catch all the great late-night movies. My favorite late-nighters are Bruce Lee movies and the Blues Brothers. The other night I saw Ready to Rumble, and last night I saw Jay and Silent Bob on Comedy Central, if you can believe that. It seems that the movies are either really great, or horrible flops (Ready to Rumble).   Today Chris mooned Hobe no less than  four  times.   As seems to be their habit, Hawkeye and Jeff have went silent. On Tuesday is Hawkeye's driving test, so good luck to him. I doubt he'll need it, as it is really easy. I expected to fail because I only drove for three hours before taking the test, so if you drive even a little before it, chances are you'll pass.  I'm kind of lacking for ideas right now.  30 Reasons Why I Am Great:  30. Usually, when I am waiting for something to happen, I sit around and it randomly happens.  29. When I go to bed at night I honestly feel that I have sabotaged the current social structure, and soon the Revolution will be here and I'll be glad for all the work I did. 28. Unless you are Bruce Campbell, I'm better than you. 27. I haven't yet been entangled in a shallow relationship which would withdraw from my self-esteem bank and ruin my current way of living. 26. I find myself interesting and engaging, which is why I spend so much time alone rather than with other people. 25. I believe that the Truth is out there. 24. I have alienated everyone I have met without coming across as a creepy X-Files fan. 23. I am different from my parents. 22. I am not ignorant. 21. My shoes. 20. I've been shot in the mouth six times, yet I keep rapping. 19. I've been rocking and rolling long enough to do damage to my body, but I don't believe in drugs or alcohol. 18. If I don't know what I am talking about, I keep going anyway, because chances are the other person knows even less than I do. (Hah!) 17. I have a pretty good grasp of concepts and ideas, yet when it comes to individual people I have no idea what I am talking about. 16. I have a T-shirt that says 'Emo Sucks.' 15. On a global level, I care immensely about causes and beliefs. On a social level, I care about change and understanding. On a personal level, I care only about myself. It is good to be a selfish jerk, because if I wasn't I'd probably listen to emo or something. 14. I don't watch late night talk shows. 13. I don't take 'no' for an answer. 12. I am self-serving, yet I don't often cross the line into pretentiousness. 11. Lilly is my dog. 10. I can read really, really fast. 9. My hair is aesthetically pleasing (especially before I got it cut). 8. I make fun of things I don't understand. 7. Bling Bling Bailey, Lord of the Brainerd Underworld, is my sister. 6. I fought the law (and I won) 5. I am an old-school musical purist, not an indie snob but a real elitest asshole, the kind that makes you sick. I am  always  right when it comes to music, and I have trod on the faces of many people who have tried to convince me otherwise. 4. I can play "Made in NYC" on my guitar,  and  I know all the lyrics. 3. I can say that people are better off for having met me.  2. I am pretty perceptive, by which I mean I read people pretty well. It always feels like an intuitive thing, and I usually know when someone is lying, even if I don't let on at the time. 1. At the end of the day, I'm just doing it for the Cause, to quote Fat Mike. I really have no other reason, no higher purpose, other than to be. So hooray for me, for not reading into things too deeply, having nice hair, and waiting for things to randomly happen.  If you can think of thirty reasons why you are great, I'd like to hear them.
