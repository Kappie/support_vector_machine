Can you hear me Can you see any part of me Can you feel me Can you bleed for me  Can't you see me walkin in your shoes Can't you feel me steppin all over your soul Can't you feel me reach into you  Can't you feel me walkin over your soul Can't you feel me wait in pain Can't you feel me reach into you  Can't you see me walkin in your shoes  Can't you feel me steppin all over your soul Can't you feel me reach into you  Can't you feel me walkin over your soul Can't you feel me wait in pain Can't you feel me reach into you  Can't you feel me walkin over your soul Can't you feel me wait in pain Can't you feel me reach into you
