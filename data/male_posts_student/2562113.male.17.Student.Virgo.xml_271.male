I decided that I wanted to drive fast so I took the parkway. While driving I was flying by the exits....10...11....What is this I get to exit 12 and just beyond that an SUV is turned sideways in the rode. The car had smoke billowing from the hood of the car and moments later the whole car was engulfed in flames. Tiny bursts of explosions were shooting off all over the place. Finally the Jewish Rescue Team called "The Heb League" came to escort their fellow Jew out of the burning vehicle. With curls flapping in the wind they ran down the parkway. It seemed as if the curls are of some radar detecting mechanism because almost instantly the parkway was covered with Jews. While all this was going on me and my cousin Daniel got out of the car and started playing Frisbee in the middle of the Palisades Parkway thus accomplishing one of my life goals. We even got an old man and a little Jewish boy with premature curls to join in on the fun.             After all this happened I went to Bobs to play a little Holdem. The first game I lost 5 bucks but the second game was my big come back and I won 35 dollars. It was such a rewarding feeling winning instead of losing which I am used to at this point. Well that is it for now farewell and until we met again.    Dr.SMUT
