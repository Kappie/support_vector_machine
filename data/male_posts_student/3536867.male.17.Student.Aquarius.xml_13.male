I also redrew this comic early in the morning one day, so there's a few continuity errors, but you may not even notice them.  If you do, I'm really sorry and I won't screw up next time.  As for lack of updates, I'm working on it.  I'll have to start on the cast pretty soon and I'll talk to the other staffers about features and what not.  As for the next comic, expect it soon.
