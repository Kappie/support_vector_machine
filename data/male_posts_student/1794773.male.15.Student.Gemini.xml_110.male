Ok, if Krista doesnt have her movie night this week, i prolly will. So someone inform me when krista is having one. K? I got my pictures back a few days ago already and half of them didnt turn out. I really wanted some with all of the guys ( wink wink) lol. I am so angry that my whole week there, i didnt get any with them. That was practically my  last chance too. Oh well. Love, RAch
