In romantic love you want the other person." Champagne represents the bubbly and overflowing love that I have for you!" "A part of you has grown in me, and, so you see, it's you and me, forever, and never apart; maybe in distance but never in heart." As I gaze upon your beauty, I think to myself, never have I seen an angel fly so low..." You may forget the friends you laughed with, but you will never forget the friends you cried with." There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. When I close my eyes, I still see you... When I take a deep breath, I still smell you... When I lick my lips, I still taste your kiss... You're my obsession.] "A smart girl can open up my mind, a pretty girl can open up my eyes, but only a sweet girl can open up my heart." :) gals are like a piece of gum, when they loose there flavor, you pop in a new one*~* Mirrors don't talk and lucky for you they don't laugh!
