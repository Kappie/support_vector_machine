We do have our differences in opinion, he smacks spiders, I shudder at the very thought; he chases Odie, whereas for me, dogs are OK. He proudly admits that the only thing active about him is his imagination. !!Bingo!! and that's where we hit it off! (The only reason he doesn't blog is because he prefers jabbing away on the remote than on a keyboard)
