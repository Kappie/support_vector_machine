To the point where I lost some sleep on Saturday.  I wasn’t going to prolong the debate, figuring it wouldn’t really accomplish much, but the more I think about it, and the more I read of your replies, I have to address some of what I see.  First, I respect everyone here, even those that wear the black eye patch and mutter ‘Arrrr’ when they download something.  That’s not going to change.  I’m not going to go around pointing fingers and denouncing you in the town square.  This isn’t an effort designed to allow me to sit back on my ‘high horse’ and sneer at the lesser beings.  What started as a theoretical debate exposed a major hole in my own belief system, and since my values are important to me, I concluded I have to repair the breech.    That led to the Blog action.  And the replies have been interesting.  Since arguing issues is what I do here, I’m going to volley back at all who replied.  Remember, the ground rules of the Blog require intellectual combat, so please don’t take offense.  As I assured Dave the other night, I take none myself, and enjoy the hard debate.  I’ve already established why I regret my piracy, and why I am trying to correct it.  I have already taken some steps, including the preparation to install Linux later his week and work towards learning it enough so I can dump Windows.  There’s no need to rehash my personal thoughts here, other than illustrating where I don’t agree with the comments I’ve seen.  Don tanked me on the behalf of Bill Gates and DMB.  I’m looking out for the vacation homes of the super wealthy.  I can only assume that the implication is: the wealthy have enough money, and my little contribution doesn’t mean much.  Additionally, I have inferred that Don thinks the money will simply be spent on yet another luxury item.  The wealth of my supplier has little to do with my decision to compensate them for their actions.  BG and DMB have supplied a service that I have elected to utilize, and that carries a price.  What they do with their profit means nothing to me.  I assume Don made commissions when he sold cars.  Does Don’s customer have a right to inquire what Don intends to do with his earnings? Should he refuse to buy if Don is going to spend the money on hookers?  The rule here is simple – the product carries a price that is well known.  I choose whether or not to purchase at the stated price.    As for Don’s comments about helping the poor or paying for education, I can only point back to my argument that these transactions should be freely chosen.  My objection to the funding levels of social programs and education stem more from the concept that the funding is obtained through confiscation of wealth at the point of a gun.  The government uses the power of force (imprisonment) to extract the funds from the populace.  The two issues have no linkage.  Dave rails against the high salaries of the content authors, as well as the ‘greed’ of the rich.  Go get Wall Street and listen to Gordon Gekko for my refutation of the concept of greed.  Greed is, indeed, good.  But to be fair, Dave is probably defining greed as some sort of forceable extraction of money from people who don’t want to provide it.  Hmm…wouldn’t the government be the greedy party here?  Ahnuld makes a movie.  The study puts a price on it.  If you don’t like the price, don’t see it!  How much more simple does it have to be?  You have a choice.  You are free to refuse to pay.  ‘Greed’ would be a case where attendence was mandatory and the price was jacked up because you must go.  Drivers license fees are GREED, because you pretty much HAVE to have one.  A movie ticket is optional last time I looked.  As for the salaries of Ahnuld and his ilk, again – what business is it of yours?  Ahnulds salary has no impact on you.  His salary is set by whatever the market will accept.  Whoever pays his salary does so because it is a bargain.  They will get more out of his services than they would out of that same $30 million sitting in the bank.  Ahnuld has proven his ability to provide a greater rate of return than most investments.  That is the essence of capitalism.  Dave mentioned that the stars are raping their customers.  Again, explain to me how this is the case in a voluntary system?  You have no inherent right to entertainment.  It costs what it costs.  If you object, you have a perfectly acceptable conduit to view his movie for little to no cost – wait for it to be on TV, or wait for it to go to rental.  You do NOT have the right to download it.  I don’t care what you say – it is theft.    Mark makes the case that piracy can be noble.  I agree that iTunes would not exist without the piracy market, but that does not excuse the pirates.  Should we thank burglars for the growth in security technology?  Should we thank car thieves for the invention of LoJack?    And again, I don’t get the idea that the industry is taking advantage of me.  A CD has a cost.  They are charging what people are willing to pay at the margin.  The price may be high enough to stop you from buying it, and you might be angry that you don’t have the cheap access you crave, but there are still plenty of people willing to spend $200 a week on music.  So long as the supply of willing spenders exist, the price will remain where it is.  The industry is there to make money, as you know.  They aren’t there to gouge and rape.  They are going to extract the maximum profit they think the market will provide.  Are you interested in making as much salary as you think your employer is willing to pay?  What’s the difference between the two?  In all cases, the terms are voluntary on both sides.  No one is forced to pay.  As for measuring myself as a ‘man’ – yes, this is what I’m doing.  I’m trying to be consistent with my beliefs.  What would you all think of me if I professed these beliefs, but then maintained a vast archive of stolen material?  But more important than what you think – I have to grapple with what I think, since I am responsible for myself.  I own me, so I must answer to me.  And what other things are more important in measuring myself than the ideas of respecting the labor of others, and paying for the things I utilize?  It is my personal choice, just as it is your choice.   And Steve.  You mentioned that if we could get away with stealing a Mercedes, most people would do it.  That might be true, and I am sad to hear it.  If the only think keeping us from stealing is the disapproval of others, then we have lost the concept of self-ownership.  It means that the will of the majority is more important to each of us then our own desire.  We should not steal because of our own internal beliefs, not because of the wrath of the mob.  It SHOULD be more important to each of us in our own self-regard.  It goes back to the concept of slavery, yet again.  If I have no qualms about taking the labor of others with no compensation, it shouldn’t bother me that others regard me as a slave to their whims.     Maybe I am sounding like some self-righteous bastard here.  I’m no better than anyone else.  I don’t think of myself as some enlightened being.  I’m just trying to sort out what is important to me, and adjusting my life accordingly.  In regards to you guys, all I really want to do is put out the ideas and have an honest accounting of what it means to pirate material.
