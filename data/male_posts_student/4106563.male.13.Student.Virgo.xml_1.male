Here's how to do it:  If you try to publish a post and DNS error (aka "FUCK OFF" error) comes up. Well, what I did was scream, "Puck up, ya little cunt!", but you don't have to do that. If it happens, then go to "Edit Posts", and you will find out that your post is on the list. Click on the little arrow pointing right, next to the title of your post. Then, go to "Status", and republish. Afterwards, you will find your post on your site. Like I did.
