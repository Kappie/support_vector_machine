Better note down everything before it runs out of my mind. quote from simon:  Today was quite boring, had to listen/watch Jamie swearing for an hour as we couldn't get the game to work...   exuse me simon, mr smarty ass, i didnt swear a lot, same as you...  Check this out... the first word of every post from James:   Ah, after, meh, pointlessness, grrr, /megroans, ..., meh, w00t, hmmm, meh, ow, hmm, /mesign, meh, meh, meh, meh, just, meh, bleh, meh, meh, bleh, meh, meh, bleh, meh, bleh, bleh...   no offence to James, but see a pattern there? Where would you be without the MEHS and BLEHS, *snigger*  Tribute to thy l33tn3ss  Jamie
