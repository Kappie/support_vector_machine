    
       Hello world, and welcome to my reality. This is my new blog at blogspot.com (it goes without saying...) which I shall use as a repository for my disturbed thought, dreams, and ideas. Here you shall find updates on my life, my DA journal entries, some LiveJournal entries, and any number ofrants, dialogues, discourses, fictional scenarios, poetry  prose and the whole monty.   VIEWERES BEWARE!! This Blog is a digital reflection and window into the mind of a madman, don't catch the sickness ;)
