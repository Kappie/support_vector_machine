This is due to the desire for personal independence which has been evading you for some time now. An existing situation and relationship is causing me to be extremely restless and I feel that I am unable to change the situation without co-operation. My situation with school and people (specifically one person) is causing me to be restless. I'm unwilling to expose my vulnerability, so I don't want to give in and be nice and work things out. I see this relationship as a depressing tie, but although I want to be independent and unhampered, I do not want to risk losing anything. Sometimes you just want to get away from it all. All this leads me to react touchily and with impatience, while the urge to get away results in considerable restlessness. My ability to concentrate has suffered. This is totally true. I'm having trouble just sitting down and getting crap done due to lack of concentration.  I guess the stress that I am experiencing at this time is due to the present situation, but it is a situation of my own making. Trying to ignore it - hoping that it will go away, has aggravated it further. Maybe I should slow down ... to relax and re-think the situation...  The song of the moment is "Gotta Get Away" from the Offspring's  Smash  (1994) album.  **
