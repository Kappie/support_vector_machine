And Nashir killed all of my team members when playing soccer including me.. First he injured Yan by tackling him on the ankle.. And then Jon was hit by him.. Rayner was also hit at the ankle.. Marcus was slid by him and rolled on the floor.. Me?? Well.. He actually wanna shoot the ball into goal but he swings his left arm and *KePoWw!!* on my stomach area.. Marcus was also hit on the spot too.. Hahaha!! But.. Fortunately.. No serious injuries.. After school.. Mas, Nashir, Din and me headed to Queensway.. Check out some stuffs.. Mas and Din was screened by the police.. For smoking.. Mas gets away lightly but Din suffered lecture because he's under-aged... Hahaha! Luckily for Nashir and me.. We never smoke.. :P Nah.. They were given warnings.. Then we headed to Queensway.. Browse for some soccer jerseys and some shoes.. Kinda expensive though.. Now that I'm broke.. Hahaha! Then after that.. We went to McDonalds to eat.. Crack jokes and laugh our ass out!! Hahaha!! Then we headed home.. Kinda tired and exhausted.. Reached home around 4+pm.. Did nothing till now... Hahaha!!
