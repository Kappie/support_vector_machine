I had to swim 30 laps in 3 different styles and in 45 minutes for the last part of the exam. I thought I could not make it, as I usually take more than 45 minutes to swim the 30 laps. After the examiner told me that I passed, I was overjoyed. But, then, I felt very dizzy. I usually feel dizzy after swimming without warming up first. Then, I celebrated at Sakae Sushi.     But, I also found out that the terrorist problem in Singapore is getting out of hand. It is said that some terrorist planted bombs in some train stations around Singapore. That is quite scary! Everyone used to think that Singapore is a very safe country. But, I found out that there are many flaws in the security system in many train stations in singapore. Singapore is not safe anymore. All because of some people.    Humans are fragile...
