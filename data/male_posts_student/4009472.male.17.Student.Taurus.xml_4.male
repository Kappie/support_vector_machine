Both the US Military and internal Iraqi Security Forces have withdrawn from Falluja, Insurgents now largely control the two cities of Ramadi and Samarra, and both sides continue the fight in Mosul.   Not only has Iraq faced internal revolution issues recently, but the cloud of scandal has once again gone up regarding the treatment of detainees. However, this time - instead of American soldiers being to blame - it seems that the Iraqi government itself faces its first allegations of human rights violations. On June 29th, the first day after the magical transition of power, Oregon Nation Guard members came to the assistance of prisoners after witnessing them being beaten by Iraqi officials. After securing the area, soldiers discovered impliments of torture ranging from rubber hose to electrified wire in a nearby building. Upon referring to their superiors, the soldiers were stunned as they were told to relinquish control of the prisoners to their Iraqi captors, and to immediately withdraw from the area.   In handing over power to Iraq, the United States has stepped into a catch-22 of its own design. It must respect Iraqi sovereignty or risk legitimacy problems in the future, but at the same time help protect the freedoms which were granted to the Iraqi people by their new constitution (which includes protection from: "torture in all its forms, physical or mental," and "cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment."). By stopping injustices such as this, the United States would be viewed by the Iraqi government as oppressive or insensitive to their needs. By not stopping such actions, a myriad of other problems would arise. Things such as morale, world opinion, and (more importantly) American public opinion would greatly suffer.    However, there are some that say this dilemma could have been almost entirely prevented had more action been taken during the 'combat phase' of the war to secure the country and lock it down. Such an action could have helped prevent insurgents from operating before they became such a problem. By not giving the Iraqi government a stable foundation on which to work, we have possibly sabotaged both ours and their chance at creating a new republic of Iraq with as little pain as possible.
