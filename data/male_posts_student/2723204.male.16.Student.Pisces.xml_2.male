I'm in a mood for love lately, so expect any crap poem again..........lol.........anyway, i've been thinking about God lately, cos' i've been reading about Nietschze and his arguments, but i'm a theist by nature, and of course, i disagree mostly with his stuff. I'll also come up with some stuff regarding that, (its seriously your bad luck to have me rambling about philosophy lol........). I'm also really getting into pink floyd lately, and many of the classic prog stuff, such as Yes and the like.............but hmmm, since i wanna do so much stuff, i'll start with the poem first...........  The Sapling   Over the window, a sky so dark, For it is night, what surprise is it to see darkness so stark? The moon, its gone, weeping in silence For the moon and my heart, is there really any difference? For I conceal my sorrow, a pretender I may be. But pining for her love, how indifferent is she.  Beteayed by her silence, i've got only myself to blame. For I thought it was love, when it first came. For love is a seed, tiny and small. But mine has yet to take root, will it ever fall? For my sapling of love she tramples, ,Unknowingly, my feelings she crush. For how can this sapling be compared to the tree? A tall oak tree, mighty and strong,And there she finds rest, ever so free.  Her love expressed in song, but its contents only he can comprehend. For I am, but, a sapling, foolish and small. For love is my food, and affection is my sustenance. How I long for the confession of your love, mentioned in utterance. And may you coil around my branches, for today, and forever.
