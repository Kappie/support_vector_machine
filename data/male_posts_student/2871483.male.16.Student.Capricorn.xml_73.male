Come here."  -   Listening to:  I Don't Want to Miss a Thing - Aerosmith   could stay awake just to hear you breathing Watch you smile while you are sleeping While you're far away dreaming I could spend my life in this sweet surrender I could stay lost in this moment forever Every moment spent with you is a moment i treasure  Don't want to close my eyes I don't want to fall asleep Cause i'd miss you baby And i don't want to miss a thing Cause even when i dream of you The sweetest dream will never do I'd still miss you baby And i don't want to miss a thing  Lying close to you feeling your heart beating And i'm wondering what you're dreaming Wondering if it's me you're seeing Then i kiss your eyes And thank god we're together I just want to stay with you in this moment forever Forever and ever  Don't want to close my eyes I don't want to fall asleep  could stay awake just to hear you breathing Watch you smile while you are sleeping While you're far away dreaming I could spend my life in this sweet surrender I could stay lost in this moment forever Every moment spent with you is a moment i treasure  Don't want to close my eyes I don't want to fall asleep Cause i'd miss you baby And i don't want to miss a thing Cause even when i dream of you The sweetest dream will never do I'd still miss you baby And i don't want to miss a thing  Lying close to you feeling your heart beating And i'm wondering what you're dreaming Wondering if it's me you're seeing Then i kiss your eyes And thank god we're together I just want to stay with you in this moment forever Forever and ever  I don't want to miss one smile I don't want to miss one kiss I just want to be with you Right here with you, just like this I just want to hold you close Feel your heart so close to mine And just stay here in this moment For all the rest of time  -  Well, fuck, where to start.  -  Well, for those of you who haven't heard my rather colourful story about Friday night, it was quite a tale.  Well, no, not really.  Basically, my parents and others got really drunk, so this South African chick named Michelline and I went out back, talked for about four hours, and ended up making out (Cha-fucking-ching!).  Then I attempted to actually drink a whole beer.  I still can't fucking do it.  I'm fucking Canadian, and I can't do it.  Then again, I need a good import if I expect to down one.  -  I was flipping through channels the other day, and noticed that the Hallmark channel had been showing Westerns.  I'm like "WTF?!  I've been missing this?!"  I mean, damn, you wanna talk about a good genre of movies, look over at Eastwood, Autrey, and hell, Jack Nickleson did one.  -  I saw the Bourne Identety the other day.  Now that's an action movie.  Whew!  -  I love the 90's rocks.  Except it's made me download "Can't touch this".  Oh, shit.  It's hammer time...  -  My drive test is on THURSDAY.  Fuck, I'm soo not ready.  -  Life is a 24 cube of Mountain Dew, waiting for you in the fridge.  -  To whoever hasn't played Prince Of Persia -  WTF is wrong with you?!  -  I relapsed and ate tuna on Friday.  -  Who knew Ice Cube could act?  Shit.  -  Aerosmith, like the 'Stones, will never, EVER, die.  -  Spent lighters are disapointing.  You try for about five minutes to get it lighted (and see the magical fire they show within), only to be crushed by the lack of fuel...  -  Sleeeeepy time.
