Sadly, there really isn't anything exciting to report, just some boring old mundane updates concerning my life.  1)	School is boring the hell out of me right now.  I can barely be bothered to study for Calculus and Discrete Math and, consequently, I'm a little worried about how I'll do in those classes.  Hopefully I can will myself to believe there is something reasonably exciting about these subjects so I can get the homework and studying done - either that or come to the brutal realization that I need these credits for my CSBA degree.  2)	It's now official: I'm a Halo nerd.  Yes, I am buying one of those Limited Edition Halo Xbox bundles.  Now add that to the fact that I've played through Halo multiple times, attend regular Halo LAN parties, have read 2 of the 3 Halo books and currently have a Master Chief action figure sitting on my desk; you can't get much nerdier than that.  Unfortunately, I don't actually have my slick new translucent green Xbox yet though, but I will be picking it up tomorrow.  Yippie!  3)	My girlfriend and I went to the river last weekend to take advantage of the remarkably hot weather we've been having around here (84 degrees…in APRIL??).  Of course, we brought our dogs and enjoyed watching them grow bolder and bolder around fast moving water and precipitous rocks.  My dog, Emmy, is a bit out of shape though and once I had to jump in and lift her out of a dangerous situation because she wore herself out swimming across some rapids.  Both Rebecca and I ended up getting injured on the excursion.  She fell and scraped her shin on some rocks and I had my foot gouged as her dog used it as leverage to climb out of the water.  4)	I'm currently reading the John Carter of Mars books by Edgar Rice Burroughs.  They are old copies that used to belong to my dad, and though I did start to read them a long time ago, I never finished.  So, now I'm going to go through all 9 or 10 of them.  It's amazing that they were written about 100 years ago, yet read remarkably like the science fiction of today.  Some of the plot elements seem too contrived, but there is a great amount of epic action and the writing is high quality.  Overall, I recommend them.  5)	On the gaming front, I'm finally playing the stunning masterpiece that is Ninja Gaiden.  It's definitely one of the top games on the Xbox and the best actioner I've played in a long while.  I picked up Dino Crisis 3, NBA Ballers and Return to Castle Wolfenstein last week and have been playing Ballers the most.  My friend Adam and I spent a good two hours playing co-op in Wolfenstein and about died laughing watching our poorly animated soldiers contort in ridiculous positions when jumping or looking straight up.  It's definitely no Halo, but a good first person romp for fans of the genre.  I haven't played much of Dino Crisis 3, but the camera appears to really be as bad as everyone says it is…  Below I've listed a few words and phrases that are often used by my friends and I.  Don't try looking in the dictionary for any of these bad boys.  If you start using any of these on a regular basis, you will become exactly 39.77 times cooler than before.  Honestly!   Schmacked Up Words and Pharases:    Lordeast  - there are too many uses for this word to list here.  It is most commonly used as an exclamation during a particularly intense moment.  Giganterr  - bigger than big, massive  Malarky  - bull shit; to say "that's malarked" is the same as to say "that's fucked up."  Lung Butter  - hurl, throw up, puke, etc…  Zacked  - stupid, lame, dumb, etc..  Sweet Jeez/Holy Jeez  - exclamation of surprise or disbelief  Manky Munkle  - the definition for this is not clear at this time; just use it randomly for the best results  Jet Baby  - a demonic being that hides behind the guise of a children's superhero  Hoo ha  - groin, nuts, balls; Ex: "I once was kicked in the hoo ha."  Consquello  - Ceciadia (sp?) at Taco Bell  Big Decker  - Double Decker Taco at Taco Bell  Oh really fool.  - self explanatory; use often and place emphasis on "really."  Big Eddie  - Any very heavy person riding a motorcycle.  Leon/Dennis  - same as: dumb ass, dummy; Ex: "Whatever Leon…"  Get 'em dig 'em smacks!  - like lordeast, best to say during moments of intense excitment  That's all for now.  Work on these and I'll introduce more during the next entry.  That's all I've got for now.  Unitl next time, Peace!
