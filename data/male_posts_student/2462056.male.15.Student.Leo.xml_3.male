I'm so happy, even though I barely ever use it, I'm just glad I didn't have to pay for a new one! The only small problem is it is hard to use the 5, 6, and 0 keys.... okay, now that you guys know about that... you can call me on my cell instead of my house... if you were going to call me in the first place...   Man oh man, I so wish Claire and Jesse and Trevor were back in town.  Its been like, a week!  It feels crazy weird not having Jesse or Trevor or Claire to call just to like, come over and keep me company while I have to watch my sister.  Hmmm, last night me and my mom and sister went to o'Charley's to eat, and it was okay.  The shrimp I got was kinda nasty, so I got some totally sweet soup, and it was really really good.  It was like, cheesey and potato...y.... i guess that describes it, hehe.  YEP! Well actually, I don't think that was last night, that was two nights ago.... because last night my dad got home from Alaska, and we watched Something's Gotta Give, which is pretty funny.  Today we had an early Father's Day.  We went and picked up the new recliner we got for him, and then when we got home we gave it to him, hehe durr.  Then we all just kinda chilled for the rest of the day, until later that night, and I went to Andy's house.  We started watching Along Came Polly, but then we switched to The Shining.  Eh it was pretty freaky, but it was way to slow for my liking.  It was more like, psychological freaky than jumpy freaky.  Yeah I got home from that not to long ago, now I'm sitting here drinking an orange soda... hehe.  Tomorrow mornign we are going to pick my brother up from the airport because he was in Alaska also, at one of his friends weddings.  Yessuh, so that's all I have to say now.
