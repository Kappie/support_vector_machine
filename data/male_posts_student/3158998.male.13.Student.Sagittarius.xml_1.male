I remember I'm going home and took bus 31. Before that, I saw Miss Tong at the bus stop, but she didn't saw me. When the bus reach two stops after I board the bus, a group of Broadrick secondary (my school la) boys board the bus.   First, their appearance was so open sia, the first two button of the school shirt was open and few of them, their short was very low.   Next, what they talk and how they talk, they talk like ah bang going for a fight. They talk about something "dirty".   Last, what they do was keep touching one another, so ...... how to describe..... don't know la. The bus was crowded with people and they find a place and bend down sit. Cannot say sit la, just don't know how to say. The way they "sit" was like ... so "open"  If Mr Lim there, haha they in trouble liao. But too bad he was not there. After few stops, they alight the bus. (Think they are having lunch together) So are they wanting to be unusual or having others reason. I notice people around them have comments about them. If u ask me, they should be in sec 2 lo. Hope Mr Lim would know what happened lo.
