I was at school wearin 2 shirts and it was hot as hell. I was just even more irritated and losing my patience. I just got real obnoxious and you know what...I liked it. Since I didn't really care anymore this was a good release of anger. I didn't bring any home but a little irritation 'cause of the rain. I got my summer scholorship letter from C.S.I! I'll be taking PsY100 this summer. I'm just happy that I will be seeing my friend JoeY(Veena) 'cause it's been like almost 1 year since I saw her! Well tomorrow the ex and I will be hanging out for most of the day. Whatever happens will happen and so forth. I think he will be coming around 9 or 10 A.M and my parents get home around like 9 P.M. I don't want to jinx it, but I'm hoping he can come! Right now, I'm listening to the last 2 Britney albums. They have more of a techno-trance-house, basically clubbing music. It's Great! It's 11:08 on my clock and I'm gonna shower. I went out tonight with the parents for dinner. You want the details, just ask. It's not what I thought it would be...  The song I put in is Britney Spears - What It's Like to be Me, of her third album  Britney . I just put in the chorus cause well it's basically telling my old acquaintances off and my friends who are on the verge of geting cut off or getting a relationship downgrade.        "Walk a mile in my shoes Do me right or I'm through Can't you see that If you wanna stay around (I’m tellin you) You’ve got to figure me out Take your time or you lose This is my game, my rules And I can see, obviously, Baby You don't know What It's like to be me"   *HoPiN 4 aN EveNtFuL 3-DaY WeEkeND*
