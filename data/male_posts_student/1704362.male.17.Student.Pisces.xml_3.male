Anyhoo, this blog here is one of many millions of blogs created by people just like you and me. They allow ordinary people to express their innermost thoughts, dreams, goals, ideas, and experiences, and publish them, for the entire world to read.   At this point, you may ask yourself this question:  WHO CARES?  There are a few different types of blogs. Some are entirely devoted to a certain subject (politics, technology, naval lint collection, etc.) Others are personal blogs, which are, essentially day after day of references to inside jokes that only make sense to around 3 people. Here's an example:   "AverageKid's Personal Blog Monday Hey carl remember ME AND THE CAT ON THE COUCH!!!!!111 HAAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAA PINK NUSTS!!!! THIS IS NOT FUNNY TO ANYONE BUT ME AND YOU, BUT I'M WRITING IT HERE TO SHOW OFF THAT I HAVE FRIENDS! This time i'll wear my underwear on the inside!!!!!111"   A message to bloggers everywhere: WE DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR INSIDE JOKES. TALK ABOUT THEM WITH THE PEOPLE WHO THEY MAKE SENSE TO, THE REST OF THE WORLD COULD NOT GIVE A DAMN.   End Transmission (REMEMBER THE PINK NUFTS LOL ROFTLEMAOAORLDKLA!!).
