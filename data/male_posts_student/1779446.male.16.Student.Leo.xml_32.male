I also finished the last half of Kill Bill and then proceeded to watch the whole thing again. I still can't get the whistling out of my head.  Anyways, keeping in tune with the unoriginal title, it's been a fast weekend. School is such a chore. I only go there for Drama and English. Maths? Who needs maths? I mean a bunch of numbers aren't going to help you unless you become a aeronautical engineer or some architect space nerd. It's not as if some terrorist is going to hold you hostage and then threaten to kill you if you don't "Find the pronumerical equation of x to the power of 9 multiplied by Cosine over pi, to two decimal places". It's useless.  So sitting here and reading over the cinema times, I can go at one! Hmm... I can buy a mothers day present (for my mum- duh!). Possibly a small paperback picture book called "The book for people who work too much".  I'm listening to Queen right now, it's got a epic etheral quality to it. I don't know how many times I can listen to bohemian rhapsody. I also just realised I can touch type. Holy crap.  I CAN TOUCH TYPE!  Cheers,  Colin  p.s I CAN TOUCH TYPE!!! HOLY SMOKE! I CAN TOUCH TYPE!
