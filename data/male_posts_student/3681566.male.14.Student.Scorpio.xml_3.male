I am 14, and live outside of London, Ontario! You probaly would have been directed here from either a Proboard or Student Center.  The best thing that ever described me was this personality test that I took. It sounds exactly like me:   Sevens use their mental intelligence to create a positive spin on life by coming up with various utopian possibilities about how things could be. They can be very inspirational as they assert their utopian ideals about how people can live better lives or make the world a better place. Robin Williams is a well-known Seven, and his character in the movie Dead Poets Society is an excellent example of this. By regularly imagining how things can be good or made better, Sevens tend to be very optimistic, and their optimism gives them the confidence to assert themselves in the world, going after whatever it is they want   Well, today I am basically going to sit on my ass all day, maybe eat some chips, or get a pop. I have an exam on Monday, so I might do some of the review sheets our teacher handed out. Either than that, I am going to see Harry Potter 3 tonight, and I might go see the Terminal (starring Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones).  See y'all around, MIK3Y
