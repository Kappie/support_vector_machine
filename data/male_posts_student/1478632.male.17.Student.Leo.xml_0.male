Next thing on the agenda: Something reeks. I'm in CAD class, and something form the area of the moron clump smells like decomposition. I think the had some school breakfast or something. And finally, I think that Biology  blows . Why? Because I've been up until almost 11pm every night this week making a project for the class. I have to make a "Portfolio containing your best works from the semester". BS. In this portfolio, I need to collect a bunch of work from the semester, and write a letter from someone I don't know to another person I don't know. Why? How the hell am I supposed to know? I'm out.  --Clash
