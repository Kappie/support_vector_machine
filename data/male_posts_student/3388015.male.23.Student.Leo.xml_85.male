We went to Tyler Mall on Friday, which was a two story mall. We shopped for 3-4 hours. Once we finished, we went to a little Mexican restaurant, where they spoke rough English, and had a great meal. My sister got a burger. I got a burrito, chips and guacamole.   On Saturday, we went to Ontario Mills mall, one of the larger malls on the West Coast, which is funny, because Ontario has 3 things: an airport, a mall and an industrial complex. We went to the mall, which was a HUGE square seemingly endless row of stores. We shopped for several hours, Aaron and Nola got a bunch of great stuff and we headed home.    Aaron cooked another great meal (steak veggies) and we ate and hung out until around 1am. Now you may be wondering why I'm up right now, only 2 hours after falling asleep. About 30 minutes ago, I awoke to the sound of glass breaking. I heard something outside like someone climbing and breaking plants. I got up and looked out the window but didn't see anything, but was going to wake Aaron up because it freaked me out that someone was outside on the roof or something.    Then I heard someone fall and scream 'Help!' That freaked me out and I headed to the garage where I heard thenoise. Danny, the brother of Aaron's room mate Kenny, was bleeding profusely and was clutching his arms. He was dripping blood and his clothes were covered.    I went and woke up Mom, a 911 dispatcher and expert at this kind of thing and she came down and started helping him. I woke Aaron up, who looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language (maybe I was, I just woke up), but Mom told Aaron that Danny needed to go to the hospital, so he woke Theresa (Danny's girlfriend)up who got her car ready. Danny had tried to wake up Kenny, but Kenny seems to sleep hard and Danny didn't have much strength when he knocked on Kenny's door. So Danny, mom, Theresa and Aaron all went to the hospital. The blood stains, puddles of blood, broken window and everything looks like, as Nola said, a murder scene.    Nola and I are sitting here now, fully awake and unable to fall back asleep, watching TV. I woke up Kenny (Danny's brother)when Theresa called and Kenny and his girlfriend went to the hospital too. I have honestly never seen so much blood outside of a movie. We'll see if mom and Aaron are still up for breakfast in a couple hours. I'd post some pictures, but I dunno if that is appropriate.
