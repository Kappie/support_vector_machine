I seriously never go out on Friday's anymore, it didn't occur to me last year, but it's really bothering me now, because somehow the end of the year brings up this unbearable depression in me.  Whatever.  "Before I blow this verse Let's Explain the name first Ambassador because fame ain't a game no more I be the senior representative that game from abroad Wanderlust inherited from MA to Stuggart State of the art Southern parts To top of the charts Set it off strike target headed straight for your heart Mark my words We got soliders marching in herds Who solved the murder? Condelence to the martyr James Bryd On towards Addis Abbaba to the Badme border area. Black on black wars from Ethiopia to Eritrea." -Freundeskreis "Tabula Rasa"  I'm really feeling more like mobilizing right now, if I could convince anyone to go the Palestinian Meeting that's in Clifton.  Free Palestine, and all that jazz.  I'll just attribute this to end of the year depression, compounded with some other random factors.  Too much work, and all that ish too.  I'll figure out something.
