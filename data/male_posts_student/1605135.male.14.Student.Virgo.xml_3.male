For those that don't understand the importance of this, the big deal is that a game with classic characters, a celebration of Nintendo's legacy, defeated a 'modern' game, which really only sold because of sex and violence.  I'm not saying GTA: VC was a bad game, it's far from it, but this just proves that the more "hardcore" gamers still support the classic games, and not cheap thrills.  More on this later, time to prepare for the next week.
