He is still 22 but out of college, living out of an apartment in Santa Barbara, where he had graduated from UCSB. He still keeps up with the college party life, and he chills every day with his college friends and frat brothers. This is the life he dreamed about: college with all the party, none of the classes, and all of the women.   He works at In-N-Out by day, but by night (and by lunchbreak) he hits the beach and hits the clubs. Every spare second he devotes to swimming and playing volleyball, Frisbee, football, and such sports at the beach; partying at all the clubs; drinking and shooting pool at all the bars, or at his friends house (the only friend of his that had a true "house") to practice with his band, Eargasm. He is single, but at the same time, he has no shortage of college girls to keep him happy. Things couldn't be better.   His one prized possession is all he needs to get through life: A sleek, powered up Mazda RX6. He has created a very close relationship with the guys at Santa Barbara Customs. For him, they created a monster. For them, they created a piece of art. Now Character 1  knows all the spots to push the limit (twice the limit, that is) on the straightaways unhaunted by the police.   Enter stage right Character 2  [ Question :  What is his name? ]. He is a complete enigma. Nobody knows his story, but they all know of him. To those that have seen him, it was an experience. To those that haven't, they are evenly split between it being a miracle or being a hoax. Some of the rumors that fly around say that he is a Martial Arts master gone mad, some say that his parents died as he was just a toddler. Whatever the story, his soul no longer exists, nothing but a steel determination to do all evildoers in. Wherever crime, corruption, or villainy strikes, you can count the seconds on one hand before Character 2  is on the scene. [ Question :  What is his superpower/claim to fame/signature? ]   One night, the current super villain [ Question :  Who was the supervillain and what is his story? ] revealed to Character 2  [in a dramatic fight scene, of course] that there was a Xenon reaction bomb hidden somewhere in the city, and at sundown one block of the city would be in ruins. Character 2  alerted the city, and, of course, some panic ensued, but nobody made drastic moves as the section was not yet pinpointed. As the sun was nearing the barrier of the sea, it was located in the floor of an apartment building, cemented to the foundation. No action was made, since the wrong action could set it off rather than preventing an explosion.   Immediately everybody on the surrounding blocks was evacuated. One door down, the last person filed out of building, a nightclub called  Eclips  and the whole group was herded to a safety barrier three blocks away. Police were dispatched to all the buildings in the danger zone to make sure every last person was out safely. Character 2  was sent in to the nightclub. Just as he finished his search and stepped out of the door, the police announced that it was the third and last call to evacuate. Five minutes to sundown. The soundproof doors and lack of windows had kept Character 2  oblivious of the announcements. Under the loudspeaker, he heard footsteps behind him. He turned to find what looked like a college kid step out of the bathroom and look around. "Hello?" He called. He spotted Character 2 . "Where is everybody?"   "Shit". Character 2  said, "You need to run. Now." And he disappeared out the door. Character 1  replied, "Shit." And he ran. As he got into the street, he saw nobody. Character 2  yelled back, "This way!"   As Character 2  neared the barrier, the policeman with the loudspeaker commented, "Shit." His loudspeaker was on. "You have 30 seconds!" He yelled, but Character 1  was still two blocks away.   Character 2  was almost to the barrier, but then he looked back and saw Character 1  still far from the barrier, and flagging. "Shit. He's not going to make it." And with that, he turned back at more than a full sprint, utilizing every day of his training and conditioning.   "Save yourself!" The loudspeaker man yelled to Character 2 .   "Run!" Character 2  yelled to Character 1 .   "Five seconds!" The loudspeaker man yelled to Character 2    "Aah!" Character 1  yelled to nobody.   "One second!" The loudspeaker man yelled to Character 2 .   Character 2  dove. Character 1  ran. The loudspeaker man winced. The bomb went off.   The green sphere expanded outward and upward. It seemed to travel in slow motion. The buildings wiggled, the windows shattered, the street rippled down its length.   Character 2  collided with Character 1 's stomach, and took him down, knocking the wind out of both of them. They had hardly hit the ground before the wave passed over then and dissipated not 100 feet behind them.   The loudspeaker man dropped his loudspeaker. The crowd screamed, babies cried.   For a moment, there was silence.   Then, every last building collapsed as if it was in a garage-floor bound elevator. A cloud of dust unlike the green explosion flew outward, this time not stopping as it covered the crowd and eventually the entire town.   All that was found was the body of Character 1 . The next day a funeral was held for the anonymous hero of the city.   But two days later, when Character 1  woke up the in the hospital, he started to hear voices in his head.
