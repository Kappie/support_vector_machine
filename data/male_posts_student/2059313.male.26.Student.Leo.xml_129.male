The week before a show opens is crazy and more hours than there are in a day are required to get the show up and running.  Now I'm trying to find a tiny bit of social time.  I think there's something about this business to make you forget the bad times and remember the good times, or think the bad times ARE good times... or something else, I don't know really.  Fortunately, I love it.  And I'm very much looking forward to Tuesday.  The show opens and there's nothing else to be done.  I'll be finished.  Then I can relax and enjoy the rest of my time here and enjoy the company.  Now, I'm trying to unwind a little bit before I can go to bed.  But, I don't think I'll be getting much sleep tonight since I need to be up and working by 9:00am.  SUCK.  Anyway... at this particular moment, I'm pretty miserable.
