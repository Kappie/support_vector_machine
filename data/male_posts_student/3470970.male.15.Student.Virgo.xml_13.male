Guess what morons, you won't stop drug trade, and you know why? Because there is an  industry  behind it. Whatever makes money and profits  cannot  be stopped. Of course, these people are willing to help humanity by placing infront of themselves the impossible task of completely erasing drugs from the planet. I do not have anything against them, it's just that they don't realise what they are trying to stop.  I've been on a website lately ( urlLink drugfreeamerica ) which is obviously aimed at upsetting the parents even more, who have already been brainwashed by the media about how drugs can "kill, and destroy". I am not doubting that, since it really is true, however, it is  exaggerated .    This banner especially annoys me on the site. It's supposed to show the "innocent schoolboy" who is still naive and doesn't know much, so requires his parents supervision at all times. Obviously, the 'donate' section cannot be left off, after all this is a "non-profit" organisation, isn't it? Pff, yea sure!    They could name the above "guide" "nerdy parents' guide" or, "pester your kid if you are bored". What is this if its not stupid anti-drug propaganda?! I have to laugh at how this reflects the authors inexperiencedness. Look, if you have kids, and this makes you scared, then here's something you might not have heard before. If you're kid wants to try drugs, then he/she  will  do so, nomatter how often you check up what he/she has been watching over the internet, or on the TV, after all, the tv programs "have a bad influence on the youth", don't they? Well good luck with you're propaganda, I'm gonna go watch scarface and pulp fiction now...and guess what?! I won't smoke crack!! WOW!   urlLink
