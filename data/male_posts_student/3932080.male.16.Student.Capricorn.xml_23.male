Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Leave (Get Out) -JoJo Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #12 As much as JoJo wanted to be the next ripest thing, she’s spending the entire summer singing the unfortunate sequel to  TLC’s  unbeatable “No Scrubs,” except this time it’s been approved for general audiences. Opening with an acoustic sap line that probably started as a cellular ring tone, the 13 year-old turns TLC’s complaints (“a scrub is a guy that just sits on his broke-ass”) into anger that her man “left [his side girl’s] number on [his] phone.” But what JoJo’s producers didn’t realize was that “No Scrubs” was made essential by  Chilli’s  piss-off attitude, as she dumped every existing loser (“I don’t want no scrubs”), not just one jackass who forgot to clean his cell’s call log.  Bottom line:  While JoJo is busy trying hard not to cry (“No tears will fall from these eyes”), Chilli is making her dirtbag thug bawl.   The Verdict:  3.2/10 - Brouhaha   (1.6/5)
