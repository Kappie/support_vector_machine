College: college is great, i took 4 subjects economics, geography, Vocational ICT (whcih  does  count as an A-level if you finsih the 2year course, and last but by no means least i also took Pyschology, whcih is a great subject we actually started some pyschology work yesterday, it wa great then we had a break at umm 9.55 for 10mins, then came back and watched a video about OCD's "Obsesive Compulsive Disorders" it really hit home the fact that pyschology is such a varied subject, its great and the teacher umm i forget her name is great.  Nothing else interesting has happened really, been talking to Danny for a bit and i'm off out tongiht to Philip's party for his good results, though its kinda a joint party with his brother Neil for his good A-level results, ah well means i get out of the hosue, think i'll take my camera as well, shoudl be able to get some good photos/videos dannys going to be there as well so yeah. Anyways, i'm going to go for a bit now, i'm bored and got ntohign to do :( and i cant think of anything to write :( i might update it later so bye for now *waves*
