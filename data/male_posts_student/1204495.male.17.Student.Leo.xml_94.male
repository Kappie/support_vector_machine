Awwww noooo =( *hugs you lots*   " Its true, she said it'd never work, i mean shes from a 'upper class' part of society i'm form 'middle class' part of society " - bullshit, she doesn't deserve you dear, nono *shakes head* she acted like she liked you.. she does like you.. awww *hugs you again*  aww and I told you to tell her... aw no =( I'm sorry, I really thought she liked you.. SHE DOES like you. *confused now* She's gone all old fashioned on you with the "classes" thingie.. =S And btw, to me you're not a burden... not that it matters really. And don't change, stay as you are, it's great that you're nice sweetheart, really great, there's not many people like you around...  "Love" is complicated like that, but it's not your fault, you've been nothing but nce to her, it's her who's overreacted and stopped talking "next day nothing" - I know the feeling. Pssst it's spelt níave.. I think? I tried to spell it the other day, heh. Don't move to Poland! *yells and is selfish here* What about meeeeeee, who'll I talk toooo? And what about all those other people that know you in person, the ones that likes you. Don't go sit alone =( It'll only get you down, try make Danny go with you too.. Danny's mad =P clinically insane, he'll cheer you up, sure he will. "stayed being anti-alice" =P well you know what I think about that.. awwww *another hug*   This isn't helping I'm sure but.. hmm dunno why I wrote anything.. hmm.. nevermind, ignore me, but don't change, nonononono NO ! You're Mark, Mark can't change.. *hugs*
