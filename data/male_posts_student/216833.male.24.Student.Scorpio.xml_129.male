I really hope I can land that sweet job in some IT department. I don't think I can deal with the general population for very long.  I felt super depressed last night. I felt super fucking shitty when I saw that I have to work 12:30-8:30 for like the next four days and I came to the realization that this is bad. I know I have a few friends that are worse off, but I just can't seem to just be OK with it. Not very many people stroll in so it's like just fucking around when you are bored. I need the internet or something.  I have to go study diamonds, so I know what the fuck i am talking about.
