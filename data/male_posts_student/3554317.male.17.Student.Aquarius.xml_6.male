I managed to churn out a 3 page one.  Not my best work IMO, but I think it'll cut the mustard.  Tomorrow is the last day of finals for most people, but for me the storm is over.  Yesterday was good.  Ate lunch at Yummy Bowl (great thai/chinese restaurant) with my friend Agatha.  We left a mess on the table.  We are quite possibly two of the worst eaters.  At the end we just gave up and flung rice at each other.  Went minimal clothes shopping at H where I bought two striped short sleeve overshirts.  H is a great store that has good prices on clothing.  Keep on truckin'.  Current music: The Postal Service - such great heights   BTW, The Postal Service rocks.
