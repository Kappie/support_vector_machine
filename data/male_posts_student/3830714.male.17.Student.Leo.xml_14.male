The NDP concert last friday was a great success! Consider this is the first time our 19th council organise a major event, some more totally orignial. Oh ya, we are preparing for teachers' day concert already, it will be a memorable one! Let me show you some of the concert pic:   urlLink    Me before going to school...   urlLink    A progressive Society   urlLink    MCS performance...  After the concert, Yuk! and I, together with ken went to watch The Village. The show was quite a twist in the end... I doubt alot of people will appreaciate the show deducing from the responses which the audience gave after the show end. Anyway, after the movie, yuk went to my house to have a second movie, A Beautiful Mind. It is one of my favourtie movies. I have been looking for chance to let her watch, finally managed to.   Overall, it was a very pleasant day for me. My first concert for tpjc, and it went on better than i have expected. Some more, after a week of hard work, i can finally go out with yuk!
