That relationship is going to end here really soon.  I recently recieved an email from her but as soon as I saw it I just got soo mad.  I know that I will have to talk to her soon mostly just to tell her that it is over for good.  But anyway before I want to put my fist through my monitor I am going to change the subject.  One a wierder side note.  I have been talking a friend of mine.  We have known each other for a while but we never really got to talk much until a couple of months ago.  More recently we have been hanging out a good bit.  I know that she is not ready for someone else but I just have this feeling about her.  In alot of different ways it feels like it did the first I really cared about someone.  The only problem is that she is still getting over a long relationship.  I know that it will take her some time to get over it.  Its the wierd part I know she needs time but I just feel so alone anymore.  The other really wierd thing is that I know "the talk" is going to be coming up soon.  The only thing I dont know is how she will take that.  Mostly I know that after that talk then most things get really wierd and out of control.  I really don't want to loose her friendship but I just don't know what is going to happen after that talk.  That is what I am mostly afraid of.  The only have two other things that are really going on.  One is work.  Work is always the same WORK.  The other thing that is going well is my Pool game.  I am really starting to get the hang of things but I still have alot to work on.  I am really enjoying playing now that I can actually win sometimes.  I have been trying to play agaianst alot of other people so I can test myself in differnt ways.  I just need to get out and keep practicing.  Well that is about all that I have to talk about today.  I just needed to get most of that off my chest.  Just keep checking in on this place to see how badly I f#*$ things up.
