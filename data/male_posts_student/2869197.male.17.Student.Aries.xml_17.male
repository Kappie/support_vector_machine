Worked at Fazoli's to raise money for my mission trip. $81 and odd cents were made, but that divided mongst the 15 or so of us doesn't really amount to much.  Questions...riddles in the dark...precious. Ah, yes. Another thing happened on Saturday I forgot to mention. I saw LOTR ROTK in the Plaza. Best $2.50 I've ever spent. It was IMHO best than the first time I saw it. By then I've overcome my pet peeves about their interpretation of the great work and could enjoy the movie for what it was: an awesome action flick. I could look at Elrond in the face and not think Matrix. Some points in the movie which seems dead serious the first viewing were wonderfully cheesy. Once again the homosexual innuendos set off a Gollum discussion in my mind which went a little like this:  Gollum: They're gay, my precious, yessssssss. Smeagol: Nononononono. They're just happy to see each other, dearest. Just happy, not gay. Gollum: They're three short men jumping in a bed, precious. Smeagol: Look. Pippin caught the flowers and looked at that pretty hobbitesssss. He can't be gay. Gollum: He could be bi. Smeagol: I'm not listening!  In the end, I decided to choose the "really good friends" theory as an absolute. They  were  simply happy to see each other. In real life, you can't just randomly choose paradigms as absolutes, but in movies I find solace in it.
