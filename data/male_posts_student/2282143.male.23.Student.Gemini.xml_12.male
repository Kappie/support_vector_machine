I think my favorite was the giraffes.  It were these guys with stilts on their hands and feet, and the neck came up out of their head.  I could imagine how rough it would be to walk in one of those things...  The coolest scene?  The one where Mufasa appears to Simba in the clouds...  It was so awesome, I cant even describe to you how it looked.  It was amazing how not only was there acting, but it was puppeteering.  As the actors would interact with each other, they would make the animals do the same.  Its kinda hard to explain all the technical details, but needless to say, you should see this play.  The story was great.  There were a few different things though, including songs and scenes.  Now I know where Morning Report came from, as it was originally part of the broadway show that they threw into the DVD.  The music was great too.  Bongo/conga/huge ass drum sets on each side in a balcony and in the pit.  Very tribal.  Lots of swahili.  Cast was exceptional.  Go see it.  Especially if you love the movie.  Thank you again Low family!
