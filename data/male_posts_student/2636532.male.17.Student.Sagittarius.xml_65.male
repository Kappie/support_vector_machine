Fuck! okay! i hate these fucking heat waves!! it was 33 fucking degrees celcius here!!!!!!! which is about..........90 Fahrenheit? anyways, it's not supposed to be that fucking hot!!! not in a place that gets to almost -40 in the winter at times!!!! i swear the heat fucking gets to your head too. like today, i had this thought that maybe if i smacked my head against the wall i would cool off, oh it seemed to work at first but it just wasn't worth the headache. i spent most of my day in my basement trying to mooch cold off of the cement floor. it's been like this almost for a week, but at least it's gonna be over soon, only 26 tomorrow and there be rain in the next couple days too. but now if you'll excuse me i'm about to dunk my head in a bucket of ice water and hope it stays numb long enough for me to sleep. -Matt
