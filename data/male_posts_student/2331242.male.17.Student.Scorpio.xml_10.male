I'm just so good at saying the stupidest shit.  Think before you speak, idiot . She didn't look that happy as I dropped her off at the hotel... It's the second time that our little communication barrier and my stupidity has gotten me in hot water. Whatever.   I get home and my dad promptly turns my ass around and tells me to go walk the dogs, because they're annoying him and my mom. I'm sorry, but you're walking around in torn shorts with no shirt on. ARE YOU FUCKING BUSY?! I don't think so. Why don't you just take care of your own damn problems instead of deffering them to your poor, helpless 17 year old son who's been studying his ass off all day long.  As you can tell, I'm quite pissed off at myself, my dad, and the world in general. I doubt there's anything rational in the above paragraph, but I just had to get that monkey (hahaha Mike, get it?) off my back.  The meteorology exam went well today, i aced that biatch. It also made me happy when Martha told me that our studying had helped her a lot too. I really love her... I just really need to watch my words if I want her to keep loving me. Maybe I'll have some more to say tonight, after I test drive "XIII." Yes, I do still play video games with all this romance, school, and turmoil in my life. Maybe we'll have some more mind-blowing philosophy. We shall see. Now, as Tucker has suggested, I'm gonna get the fuck outta here.  (my apologies to Martha and my readers for my harsh words, but hey, they had to come out some time)
