There's smoke drifting around outside: the Everglades are on fire.  This has been the summer of flame for me (somebody told me I looked metrosexual tonight -- ha!)  I'm listening to Crime and Punishment, a book on tape.  Interesting note: apparently, the "crime" in Crime and Punishment translates more accurately to transgression.  I.e., he steps outside the realm of acceptable behavior, finds himself alone, and discovers that being alone is worse than being afraid.  Dostoevsky was a conservative.  I like the Edwards ticket.  If I had a chance to vote at some point thus far, I probably would have voted for Edwards, if only because he's been in politics for just six years.  That seems to me to be a major bonus.  Before that: a sleaze-ball lawsuit-oriented attorney.  At least he had a job.  Kerry, bah.  John Kerry cut in front of me in line once.  I was waiting to get ski rentals, and suddenly, Kerry and two of his aides pushed me and my dad aside.  One of the aides walked up to the rental desk and said: "Senator Kerry is here for his skis".  But -- and I view this as a plus -- Kerry has never, to my knowledge, bombed a foreign country.  I don't think he even knows how to fly.   Masturbated tonight -- but don't tell anyone.  Who wants to know about that, anyway?  I bet  you  do, you sick little pervert.  Watched the Big Lebowski for a few minutes tonight.  It's not as good as it once was, but it's still a great movie.  Jesus is probably the best movie character ever concocted.  Eight year olds, dude.  Eight year olds.
