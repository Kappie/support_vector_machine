Usually when I've got cash, I use the internet for porn and Padres box scores...I don't know if money fuels my need for baseball and felching, but the daily schedule during financial stability is straightforward:  HOPE I DIDN'T PEE THE BED:  Wake up. INTERNET:  Email,  urlLink Union-Tribune ,  urlLink ESPN ,  urlLink Padres Message Board , my blog comments, blogs I link to, porno MISCELLANEY:  Writing, food, or Days of our Lives COMMODITIES:  figuring out random ways to spend my money  Life after the internet check is always a crapshoot, but if I'm not in class or not working, I'm somewhere writing.  And if I'm somewhere writing, I'm somewhere spending money.  But when your nut is infected, you're popping two $5 each pills a day for a month, your insurance covers none of it, and the cash loan you were told you could get on August 4 still isn't available on August 15, tradition and repetition must be damned for beer and movies (I have two free popcorn coupons for Regal Cinemas, and I should get a free coke coupon next time I see a Regal film, so it's almost cost-productive for me to see a movie this weekend).  Thus, the paltry hours of the day that would usually be spent at Texadelphia or picking something up at Borders or Vulcan Video end up utilized in the PCL library, sitting at a slow Dell computer (seven years ago, this piece would be a beast...Paul Jones, Daniel Young, Matt Haley and I sat in Young's room downloading dirty pictures...the pictures were maybe 200K, and they would each take 5 minutes at the least to download), reading weblogs and seeing where I rank in the scheme of the written web word.    And I'm pretty good.    Three years ago, I built a website for the  urlLink Centenary College Student Government Association , promoting the progressive actions we embarked on for the school year (NOTE:  1)  That is not the original index page, it was destroyed by a later webmaster.  2) Don't try any of the links on said page...someone broke the code after I left, and no one ever bothered to fix it).  I built it in order to celebrate our group, yet give Centenary students easy access to the issues and their representatives -- we posted representative bios, a detailed budget documenting all transactions, all legislation brought to the table, and the voting record of each senate member.  At the time of the site's unveiling, I noted to the senate that it was one of the 20 best college SGA sites in the country.  If anything, my words were an understatement...I visited over 200 college sites, of which maybe 75 had SGA sites.  Few of the sites looked crisper, and none provided near the content we did.    For that work, I was paid $500.  I never complained about the money, nor am I complaining now.  I was also paid $1200 as the SGA's Vice President of Internal Affairs, so for $1700, I worked 20 hours a week for the Centenary SGA during the 2000-2001 school year.  After I left, Drew Sutton volunteered to keep up the site.  He would be paid $1200 as Vice President of External Affairs, but he asked not to be paid the $500 stipend as webmaster.  I told him he needed the money; not only was it laborious work that was rarely appriciated, but a paycheck would keep him honest and working on the site.  He said he'd be fine.   Three years later, the site is still for the 2000-2001 SGA.    I tell this story because I understand what people want, and I understand how hard it is to manufacture.  People want content.  People want links to surf through.  People want a website that never ends, that will always be there with something new when they log on.  Whenever I get onto  urlLink Homestar Runner  and there are no new cartoons, a part of me dies, because I need new stimuli, and I know HSR provides much better that most of the flash animation on the web.    This site is good...my writing is pretty fresh...it's enough about me to keep folks interested, but not so much that it's a boring drone about my wake to bed existance.  But I've got an entire  urlLink site  that is not utilized, that sits as nothing more than a poorly organized portfolio, and that I pay $12/mo for.    We want content.  We want content that is in some way fresh and exciting.  And we want content that teaches us something, but not in the traditional, textbooks-open call of the term.  It's what I've wanted to produce since I decided I was going to have a post-Centenary webspace.  It's what I hope to do now.
