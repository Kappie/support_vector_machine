They describe Econ Grad programms at then end of the eighties with students complaining that they getting overwhelmed by the math and meaningless theoretical research and nobody has enough energy, time etc left to actually get more active in societal meaningful contributions, as for example policy. From what I gathered I and my classmates have a somewhat similar perspective, but it doesn't seem as bad as it was (at least here at Yale now). Policy jobs seem to be higher reputated as earlier, especially at the IMF and the Worldbank. And Economists seem to get somewhat closer to reality, at least when I hear them complaining that then nobody used surveys and today i think they are a pretty common tool.
