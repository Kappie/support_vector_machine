In the end it was a nail-bitingly close match, Ruslan Fedetenko scored 2 for the Lightning, Calgary only managed one goal through Craig Conroy.  So the series ended 4-3 to Tampa Bay, and the Flames now have to fly all the way back to Calgary without a trophy to show for their year of hard work. They really shone in the playoffs, knocking out all 3 western division champions (Vancouver Canucks, Detroit Red Wings and San Jose Sharks) to get to the final.   I reckon they'll do better next year, in the league at least.  But for the time being, congrats to Tampa Bay Lightning, the 2004 Stanley Cup Champions!
