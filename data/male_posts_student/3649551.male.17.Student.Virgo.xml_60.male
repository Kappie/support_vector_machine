I will return for a brief time and will then leave for a week in beautiful San Diego. I might have Internet access down there, so I might update a bit. Not that anybody cares - I'm still convinced that this blog is not a matter of life and death to most people. By the way,  Adventures in Missing the Point  is a brilliant book. The cover reads, "How the culture-controlled church neutered the Gospel." Great stuff. Farewell blog, for a time. I shall return to you if I don't meet my doom along the course of my travels.
