I got to do things with fircrafter which is also always good.  It is awesome, Friday and Monday I get to go on field trips.  That is sweet, two days where I get to do nothing all day, the only thing is make-up work, but it looks like there won't be that much.  Life is good.  Well, not much is going on in my life right now, so not a very big post, but no one likes reading a long post anyways.  Got to go.  See ya.
