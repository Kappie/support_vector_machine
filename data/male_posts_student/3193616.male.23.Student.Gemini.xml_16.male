Considering that the PM has asked all the states( Inculding the ones ruled by Congress), it seems to prove that all claims of Congress that they have been ruling nicely have gone into din, or so it seems. MAy be PM didnt think it fit to seperate Non-Congress ruled states for criticising and goding for good work.
