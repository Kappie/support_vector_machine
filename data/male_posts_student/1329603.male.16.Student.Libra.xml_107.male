I fell over 3 times; once was a deliberate bail rather than be faced with skiing backwards, once was going too fast up a ramp, other was going to slowly up a ramp. None of them hurt in the least, which was nice. When I went too fast was the coolest, I slid down kind of the way you read in bed. Twas fun.  Showstoppers was strange, all I can say about it. We didn't get much done.  Sally's emailed me back. Yay. Right email address. She was confussled about my name on MSN 'til she saw my email address, which gives it away slightly. Part of it being "Jon". But yeah, she's emailed me back. Mental use of smilies, it really is insane.  I'm knackered, but pleased with life. And I'm meeting Laura on Saturday, which continues to be something I tell to my friends, who promptly reply "...who's Laura?". Bliss.  Anyway, must... stop blogging. I've got nowt useful to say.  Quote of the day: "Like the waves crash on the sand, Like a storm that'll break any second, There's a hunger in the land, There's a reckoning still to be reckoned, And there's going to be hell to pay At the end of the day."  From   At the End of The Day   from the musical   Les Mis   Love, Jon Roskilly
