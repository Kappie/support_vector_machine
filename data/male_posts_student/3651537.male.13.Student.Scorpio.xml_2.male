Now I have to GO THERE AGAIN at 3. What marvellous timing. MY C++ is now oalmost completed. How marvellous. This just leaves my ACE...then again, I have LOTS of ace to do. I am...not confident about metting all 30 points for ALL subjects. In fact, I am almost certain that I will NOT meet the target. Sigh...  Also, my MRP is not up to scratch. My methodology needs to be changed. IN fact, EVERYTHING needs to be changed. Therefore, my main paper needs to be drastically improved(lit review simply terrible). LOts of stuff to do. In fact, jsut writing this entry had changed my view on my present homework situation.   Oh yes, the teachers want me to stay away from Jun Hong, as he also has problems and may undego counselling(like me). Just a sidenote...and another one-saw Fabian at Genting(when I was there). Said hi. Guess my relationship with my classmates isn't SO bad? That's a thought.  Well...I still have quite a number of entries to go. I should hand this in by mid-July. Cya!
