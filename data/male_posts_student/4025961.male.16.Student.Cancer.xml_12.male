That's heart breakin aint it? But on the serious tip, there's more problems at hand.  I have yet to get my driver's license, I turned 16 last month, and haven't even gotten up on the game, like I should be. Word. I slack off too much. I have yet to get a job, so I really need to start shapin up.  Man... imma stop messin wit this computer shizz for a while. Need to get shit straight.  Pz.  Today's Message from Erwin: proffessional slackers are really good actors, but they dont get SHIT DONE.
