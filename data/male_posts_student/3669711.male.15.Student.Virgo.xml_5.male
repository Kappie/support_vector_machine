Here are some of the highlights.  First of all, there are cool themes that you can use with firefox, much like the older versions.  Not much has changed, except they look a bit cooler.  A little more eye candy.  The one i have right now, i really like.  Its called Noia 2.0 (eXtreme), and you can get it from  urlLink this site .    Another cool thing is the extentions that you can use.  This is also not changed, but there are tons of new extensions that are available.  One of the coolest ones is called 'bugmenot'.  Have you ever been annoyed by websites that ask you to sign up for them first before you can review their material?  Well, be annoyed no more, bugmenot is here!  Bugmenot is joined to a forum on the internet where people have given away usernames and passwords for certain annoying sites.  All the firefox 0.9 users have to do is right click, select bugmenot from the menu, and you will probably get a username and password.  You can review other extensions  urlLink here .  The biggest change of firefox is the menu's.  Now, you don't have to go into tools -> options all the time to go to the extensions and themes.  They are right on the tools bar.  Very good.  I applaud the people at mozilla.  Lates
