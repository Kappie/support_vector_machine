She said she and some friends were playing loud music and screaming in the hallway between 4 and 6 in the morning.  I kind of remember hearing something in the middle of the night,but if it woke me up I fell right back asleep... so I told her I didn't really notice.  And she told me it woke my next-door neighbor up, and she went out in the hall and asked them all to be quiet.  But apparently I slept right through.  My question is: what the heck are people doing making noise in the hallway -- what are people even doing awake?!? -- at 4 in the morning?  Maybe this is why people think law school is hard.  If you're gonna be up at 4 in the morning, just staying awake the next day is going to be hard, let alone reading and thinking.  I just don't understand...
