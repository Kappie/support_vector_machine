I still have no clue what that was all about yesterday it was an odd, odd feeling but it's over now so maybe I'm not as crazy as I think I am... Anyway Courtney is off to Illinois I don't know when she'll be back, I think she went to see her brother before he moves along with her dad so it kinda sucks without her I'm even more bored! I could call her cell I suppose but right now I really should take a shower, I think I will right after this post and maybe drink some good old java to get me going because right now I could go back to bed again... Man I love the summer life! It's so fun! Well, not really, but at least I get sufficent sleep most of the time... My sister is supposed to call me here pretty soon, she wants to go see a movie and then talk about the concert in August which reminds me, me and Josh, possibly his cousin too, are going to see Evanescence and Three Days Grace in Ohio hopefully it works out because TDG rocks! Josh has become like obsessed with them like I am with Simple Plan, I do have to admit though the lead singer is HOT! I'm trying to stick with half way decent grammar and capitalization from now on with my blog, because I'm not learning anything by doing it. I might as well practice up on some English while I'm blabbering about junk that no one even really cares about...
