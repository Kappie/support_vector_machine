And the way things look now, it looks like I'm gonna be writing a poem every day for a while... haha actually for 14 years I figured it's 5,110 days, and therefore that many poems as well.  But I don't really like cummings' style.  I like a little more structure, not too much but not that freeform.  That's why I'm not going to ruin "Summer on the Green" by trying to redo it "cummings style."  I'll just do the easy way out and write about cats (as in, "Fog" talked about cats, that was the other option).  Anyway, 2 poems last night.  "Summer on the Green" I remember the summer on the green. Stargazing Trailblazing, The white lies Like butterflies.  So pleasant A timeless present, The summer on the green.   "A New Beginning" Rise to your feet Look to the East Blue flame mixes now With cloud This day being A new beginning You probably won't understand the last one, unless you know me very very well, and I doubt anybody knows me well enough to understand the whole thing.  (Hey I don't understand myself sometimes)  And I'm not going to explain it, you have to figure it out for yourself.  I figured out a name for my last poem, it's called "Grievance" Anyway I must be going.  Later
