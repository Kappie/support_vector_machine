I was able to get rid of it after first going to an online virus "sweeper" that destroys everything that looks like virus and had put itself in every folder that contained the word "share". I think it was trying to spread whenever I shared something with other people.  Anyways...It couldn't delete a process that was running in the background "explored.exe"   Okay that's it...Oh yeah!...Finally I'm gonna download ep 89 of Naruto from [Anbu-AonE] today as soon as I finish downloading this giant .torrent dowload of 5157.0 MB!  5 #$@*%! gig's!  Ohhh, the power of bittorrent!    I also made some funny animated gifs that I ripped straight from videogames: Mario running      (Mario 1) Mario running      (Mario Advance) Mario walking away (Mario  Luigi: Superstar Saga) Mario running      (Mario 3) Link running       (Zelda:Link to the Past)
