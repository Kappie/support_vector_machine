They even wanted to verify my zip code  street number! Of course, since I was trying to use a Canadian credit card, this failed miserably :-(
I had to pay the bill in person at a mall, which cost me an extra $3. On the bright side, I finally received my bank card for the account I opened almost 2 weeks ago.
