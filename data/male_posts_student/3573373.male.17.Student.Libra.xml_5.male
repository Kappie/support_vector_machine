"dont look at that [remember, you're LISTENING to it] look at this... for all of you coming off the street, now you feel the heat, and its time that you moved your feet to the monster, nutziest rock steady beat of Madness... one step beyond..."  so, as above mentioned, today was a day of punkass hijinks on the streetz of santa rosa. my grunge-master friend was there as we were biking through Indian Village and the "187" 7-11 over by Piner. We got the mad looks from all of the gangsta kidz that were riding their chromed-out bikes with the chain steering wheels and rimz. i was wearing yellow so i wasn't quite sweatin' it in terms of the Sur 13's versus the Norte 14's, that is, unless there were some CRX's or Integra's crusing around with some 1337 Azn's inside... but they're on my side secretly cause im japanese. [yakuza-style biatch.]  then we weaved in and out of traffic making our way back to the east side, avoiding random bums and huge burly dudes along the way. pausing, we got slurpies and sat alongside the freeway drinking them. then we ran across the freeway and maneuvered through bushes, fences, and cars trying to reach a sidewalk. when we got back, we listened to Madness while we watched "The Complete History of No Doubt" on VH1 and "Pimp My Ride." No Doubt was soo cool when they were an actual ska band in the 80's and early 90's. then, after the Return of Saturn everything went to hell. Now Gwen Stefani is all Eve'd out glam GhettoFabulous and they make whaack dance-pop-reggae eurotrashmuzik. Tony Kanal is by far the coolest member, even now, cause his fashion is HELLA ILL!  anywayz, yeah, this day was pretty iLL in termns of having insane amounts of fun for the entire day. should be iLLness going on tomorrow as well, but we'll take each day one at a time. i can't wait for the used clothing store to open on Mendo, that store will be where its at! managed to spend 1.34$ today, at the same time making 5.00$, so, unlike so many other days, i made a profit. oh yeah, being cheapass has its benefits. tomorrow will probably hit me up for some mad ca$h though, oh well, what you going to do? uemployed is the coolest status ever. like the beastie boys say, "your teacher preaches class like you're some kind of jerk, everyday i drink Old E and i don't go to work." i live by that. or not. whateva pays the billz i suppose.  iLLness all around. much happiness to ya'llz. thanks!
