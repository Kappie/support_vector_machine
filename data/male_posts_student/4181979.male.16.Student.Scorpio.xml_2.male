I dont know why i am wasting so much of my time...  Anyway,quite a lot of activity in the past 1/2 days.....or atleast i feel so.  Today in the PE period i escaped the fate of something evil by telling the REP when she had come from inspection...that i had come to take  a medicine.  HA!  Anyway,came back and DID NOT have lunch....but had bhel-puri in the evning.  Today,my right foot was bleeding but i still went on playing tennis for the time i was playing it.....there are somethjings in life that u wouldn't mind doing...even when u r in the most excruciating pains....  Anyway,i have hardly studied today...a fact which i hope to change in the nxt few hours....but befor e that i must get prachi's chem notebook photostated for the friday i had missed....and then should do some matrices and determinants.  bleh!
