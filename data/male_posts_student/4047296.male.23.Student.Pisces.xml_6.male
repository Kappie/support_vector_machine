Months will go by with nothing, then i might write twenty poems that are all similar. Then another few months go by. Ive written a decent amount this summer. I think its because i am taking classes and am not working. That combination will lead to creativeness. A lot of people complain that all i write is dark. This is simply not true. I have gone through phases where i write a lot of "happy poems." But i like the wisdom of my friend Mark A, who also has a history of writing some sad stuff. Not word for word he says: "If I am happy, i dont have anything to write about. You always have something to write when your down, sad, depressed, so on. Why do you think i havent been able to write anything since i got married." He was referring to his wife Linda, who, romantically, has made him happy enough that he can't write. Some would call that tragic. I don't know what to think. But the thought has occured to me that God is keeping me single so i can write as i do. (but i think alot of things that are rubbish.)  Anyways, due to the recent high number of complaints of my depressing poems, i have written a few happy ones that are dedicated to those people. Here they are, they are untitled:  Happy poem 1  Running marathons With music playing from the trees A forest fun affair They're playing my favortie song The one about the boy and the girl Somewhere in Canada They ran to Taking the Greyhound Always Sitting by each other I'm on the last leg Can't feel my legs But my heart is joyous I think i see my favorite person Waiting at the finish line Maybe we will keep running All the way to Canada   Happy poem 2  The forest is green this time But its spacious And the flowers smell wonderous In my bag i have the lunch And a letter i will give you later Maybe when we get to the ocean We can see it now From amongst the trees The trail is wide now And the air is cool   On the buisness side of things, i have recently read a book on how to pick locks. I have picked my front door deadbolt 5 times, (the best time being 3 minutes) the back door, and a few others. So i am offering my services. Call me anytime you are locked out of your house and i will get you in. I charge $5.00+. And no i won't tell you how i do it, otherwise i would be poor. :)  Peace
