After laying on several matresses and finding that we are too poor to buy the ones we (I) like we ventured on to Target, Linens 'n Things, Pier1 and Lowes.  We found many things we liked and wrote our ideas down so we would not forget.  Luckily while we were at Lowes we decided to check out the tile section one more time before leaving... this led us to find the bathroom tile that we really liked that is super inexpensive.  So jumping on this rare chance, not willing to test our luck and their future stock, we bought enough tile to do our third bathroom (Cryntel - Corsica Blue).  Although now that we have all the tile we are not sure which bathroom to do in blue and which to do in black and white.  Lucky for me this will be Nathan's decision!  So yippee for us, we are one more step closer to having our building materials all bought. Woo hoo.
