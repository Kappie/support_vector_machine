Well, I'll tell you, but it'll take SOME reading...    1: Belgium    Belgium was... cool and cold at the same time. Fancied a girl called Lizzie who I completely failed to get off with, was fancied by a girl (yes, a REAL one) called Beccay who kept hugging me (which we both needed at the time, I was worried about Suz like a good li'l brother and she was just depressed), and had general pretend-gay moments with Toby. All-in-all, it was good. We played... outstandingly. Seriously, it was really good. But Digby is leaving us now. >_    2: Zoe's Halloween Do    I came back to be invited by Zoe to her halloween party. Oh, rapture! Such honour has ne'er been experienced by a mere mortal like myself. I got a little bit drunk (only a little, which considering what I had makes me a comparative heavy-weight, apparently) and hugged Lisa, Li'l Joe and Patrick a lot, much to only Lisa's discomfort. It was a good night, despite Max going a bit mad and passing out naked in the loo and making everyone worried about the possibility of alcohol poisoning. Hugged Zoe and she held my hand for a bit ^_^. Honoured! 'Twas fun. Wow, the things you get invited to if you're... well, completely blatant and annoying. Found Zoe overly attractive but I always do when I'm in her prescence for extend periods. Patrick, I'm not blogging it. Look at me not blogging it! Zoe's friends are great... but she doesn't have Scott. I hope the cheque's in the post, mate.    3: Band Practice    OK, it's a little out of order. That happened earlier this evening. I can safely say that it's the worst we ever played, but the Chinese meal we had was nice and tasty. Yum. My throat is really bad at the moment, so most of the songs were out of my range. Grr, I dislike Ben(drummer)'s mum. She first critised "It's a Kind of Magic" for being too high, and then when we transposed it she critised us for playing it wrong! What a CUNT. Never mind, hey? She pissed me off and I had to stop myself from crying during With or Without You. It's because we did the song all the way through, that's when you get the full effect and you almost die of over-emotion. Still, squeh, it wasn't that bad.    4: Bristol + Cribbs Causeway    Really, this only counts as me spending 3 HOURS on my own in Cribbs Causeway. I had Â£18 though. I bought; >> A Wales Rugby 15s hat, which is red and trÃ©s chic (Â£7); >> A beach ball that is big. Yay! (Â£3); >> A Casette player (for the one we have is shit) (Â£5); >> A GLASS of coke (Â£1, what a fucking rip-off); >> A cool chinese necklace thing (Â£2, not bad).  Mum bought me (saying it was for Christmas); >> A black shirt (Â£25); >> A white tie with a silver stitched dragon on it (oh so sexy) (Â£10); >> Some trousers (Â£15).  As a result of buying the tie I now know how to tie a "Windsor knot". Go me!    5: Misc.    OK, we'll go from the top. >> Miller emailed me a couple of times. Yay! Looks like we might be sharing cars sometimes to go to GYWO. Double Yay! And she turned me on, firstly by saying she was wearing a thong (oh so hot) and then by revealing that she had slept in my bed while I was in Belgium (!!! oh so MUCH of a turn-on!). I'd just like to declare to the world... A REALLY GOOD LOOKING BLONDE GIRL WHO IS SMALL WITH LARGE BREASTS SLEPT IN MY BED! WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! Enough of that. >> Sam and Marcus have split. I hope it's not for too long. You know that saying, the only constant is pain? Well, in a way, I hoped they'd prove it wrong. But nothing's right any more. See, I can screw being deep sometimes. I'm not going to say "get back together!" because... what's the fucking point? You can't force people together. Well, you can, and people do. But it's git-worthy. >>Wrote a trombone Duet with Toby... well, now it'd be yesterday, but when I started writing the post (over 30 mins ago) it wasn't. It's a good duet. >>I'm tired and ill... My throat and stomach are both KILLING and I'm going back to see the Doctor on Monday. He's going to say "Ah, well we'll put you on the antibiotics which effectively disibilitate you again, and we'll see how you are in 10 days". Git.  Quote of the day: "Forlorn! the very word is like a bell To toll me back from thee to my sole self! Adieu! the fancy cannot cheat so well As she is fam'd to do, decieving elf. Adieu! Adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades Past the near meadows, over the still stream, Up the hill-side; and now 'tis buried deep In the next valley-glades: Was it a vision, or a waking dream? Fled is that music: - do I wake or sleep?"  From John Keats'   Ode to a Nightinglae   Love, Jon Roskilly
