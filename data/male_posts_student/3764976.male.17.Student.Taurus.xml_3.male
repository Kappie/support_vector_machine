No one will listen to me normally so I figure that no one will read this anyway. Thus I will continue to rant on. A little over a year ago, I had gotten a development deal from a percussion company that will remain nameless, as I have no ill feelings towards them. At the time, Days Unknown was gaining ground fast. We were writing songs each practice and had tons of songs that were ready for a CD. We were planning on going into the studio in January, and then someone decided that the singer needed to be replaced. Now, the singer was the one who was setting all of this stuff up for us, and was like a manager at the same time. So now we had no singer, and we had all but stopped practicing and talking. So we broke up about a week before we were supposed to go to the studio. Fast forward 6 months and I get a notice from the percussion company. Apparently, as I had forgotten, if I am inactive as a performer for a 6 month period, my deal is terminated. Guess what, the end of July marks 6 months. All I've heard for these past 6 months is people telling me that they were going to start a band with me, and then blowing me off and doing nothing about it. Now, because of me being too trusting and a good person, I'm losing the biggest thing to happen to my career as a drummer.   Now, onto other bullshit. I know that people are busy, and I am too, but there is no reason to tell me that you are going to do something with me, and then not tell me that you can't until after I set everything up. I also don't think that I should have to beg my "friends" to hang out with me. It makes me feel like I am everyone's back-up plan when their real friends don't want to do anything. When that happens, it's always "Hey Mike, what are you doing tonight?". Why do people have to be so two-faced towards me when I try hard to keep people happy, and sometimes at my own expense? I just don't know why I can't have a friend who actually wants me around instead of just using me as a stand-in when no one else will do something.
