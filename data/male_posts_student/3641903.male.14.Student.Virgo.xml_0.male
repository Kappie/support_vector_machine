A lot of problems arouse when i got back to school, first my maths holiday homework was not complete and i had to see my stupid form teacher, a dam bloody HYPOCRITE, try to act as though nothing happened and try to act INNOCENT, try to act as though he is my friend, huh dam pissed see his face, bloody no good for nothing, you wanna tell me something, tell me directly on the face, DON'T BADMOUTH ME BEHIND MY BACK!!!!! bloody hell if i had the equitment and money and the authority and power, i am going to place him under my creation of "101 types of very painful and slow types of sadistc torture" by Lucien Phua, then he will not try and double-cross me, or better just slice his head off clean, then take it and feed the pigs, the body also!!!! ok continuing on well nothing has changed about my class except a classmate of my class transferred school to punggol secondary school or something, by whatt the other said, so if he reads this all i have to say is Yih Dar good luck in anything you do, we will be missing you. Alrighty then continuing off, well most of my teachers have not change, except there is a sudden surge in the no. of female teachers who dyed their hair, but none of my teachers have changed, but there was a funny thing that my chemistry teacher, miss queenie chua has forgotten most of our names or to be exact, she can't remember shermans name and when she ask him what was his name, yong rui kept on saying 'sheman sheman' and she was dam confused and said sheman and sherman, but finally she remembered his name was sherman, while i just sat in my seat and laughed in contemplation of his suffering, in others words i am just being a sadist enjoying sherman sufferring muhahahahahahahahahahaha oh yeah for those who do not know laughing in contemplation of other peoples suffering in short means sadist. okback to where we werei fainally got back my no.1 uniform, oh god i missed it and tommorrow i have to pay jeremt ng $5.40 for the corporal rank for the no.1 uniform. so after school i went home, but had to get back to school for NCC day rehersal, bloody hell colin chia and guang yi liang say i don't want them to go for the standard first aid course, bloody hell is you all who said that you don't want to go because it was too expensive, so now you all want to go, when last term you all said that you didn't want to go, it is your fault you all didn't want to go not mine, if you want to blame people don't blame me, blame yourselves for not wanting to go to the course. so wer had to rehearse for the NCC day parade,at first i had nothing to do, but suddenly si4r wie jie ask me to go up to replace matthew heng as announcer as he was not there for the rehersal and i was dam nervous as it was my first time. so we finished the rehersal, had our meeting and then went home. tommorrow is going to be a long day first lesson will be my crazy english teachers lesson, bloody ang moh. ok i won't continue anymore4 ok i want to sleep now dam shagged ok bye!!!!
