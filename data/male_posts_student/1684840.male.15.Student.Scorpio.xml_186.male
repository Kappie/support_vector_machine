On the way home we tried to think what the evil cow from book 5 who teaches DADA was called (turned out to be Dolores Umbridge).  I can't wait to see the next 2 films!  I had  a bit too muchg fizzy pop and chocolate again I think... I feel funny :S     As you can see, I've been pretty movie mad lately.  I better go... cya!
