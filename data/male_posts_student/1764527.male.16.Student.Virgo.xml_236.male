 Why the hell doesn't anyone ever comment on my posts? Is it that y'all don't know how? (Click where it says "Comments".) Or is it that no one actually reads my blog and I'm just ranting into empty space?! Argh, that would really frustrate me, if anyone is reading this, can you at least comment once that you exist and that I have some semblance of a readership? Thanks, I'd appreciate it very much. 
 EDIT: Please don't just comment on this post that "I read your blog" unless you have no other opinion to offer me about my other posts. Thanks!
