Planning my best man speech is providing somewhat of a headache.  Having known Robert for the best part of 15 years I have accummulated a lot of wedding speech 'ammo' so to speak, with the obvious aim of embarrassing the young man!   From our first meeting at   urlLink Cub Scouts  , when I was present at Robert's famous declaration of dismay that his mum wouldn't let him have a mohican haircut! Oh yes, times were hard in Colyton in 1989! Through many a drunken escapade in and out of the pubs of East Devon I have been privileged to be accompanied by such an expert in the art of daring and sick-pile making.   However, the best man speech is not my only problem. There is the matter of the wedding gift, possibly the most important gift there is to buy.  So what could possibly befit such a gent and his beautiful bride?  1)   urlLink A Merkin  . A gift from the heart, and one that can be shared with loved ones and friends. Personally, at the wedding reception I look forward to hearing the words " Nat, Give us a twirl "as she tries it on for the first time!!  2)   urlLink A Wax Jacket  . You know you want one Robert, even if its just so you can show it to Nat on your wedding night! Only true Wax jacket connoisseurs know its actually supposed to be worn around your nob! 3)   urlLink Du pain  . Mon je soif je voudrais un Orangina Robert et I want some pain. 4)  A Sad Bastards Accessory Kit . Complete with tank tops, candy cigarettes, a barrel of Stella Artois and Dave King peering at you spewing in his toilet! 5)   urlLink A Bucket  . You never know when you'll need one to pop your head in, just think of the embarrassment if you forget to put it on before you pass out and spew on the floor!  Decisions, decisions!  Well, no doubt I shall be posting here more as the big day approaches and my pants begin to feel the strain of my nerves!  The  Stag Party  is provisionally booked in for  July 17th , Mr Wickins will be in for a treat! Ha ha!
