I also bought Trillian. Who says piracy doesn't result in real purchases? I used the program for 2 years and got so used to it that I had to buy it when I could no longer get glitchless pirate versions.  Mmm... turkey sandwich... on wheat...  Now playing: The Darkness - "I Believe In A Thing Called Love"  Man I've been really tired as of late. It's the whole going to sleep really late thing. However, the reasons for going to sleep really late recently has been for fun reasons. Late night dancing and singing to 80s music following Mardi Gras festivities? Oh yea and there was also some cross dressing... no it wasn't me this time.  Now playing: Mr T. Experience - "Stephanies of the World Unite"  I need to hand in my funding application today... so stressful!  ***
