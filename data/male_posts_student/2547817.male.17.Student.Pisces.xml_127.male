You know, I was talking about loosing my charisma? I spoke to my friend. She's quirky and knows more stuff than I. Miss Luah's great. I'm still me and I ought not let external circumstances be a definitive factor of my being. I am who I am, just better than who I was and maybe worse at some things as when compares to who I was. So does that mean, I'm the same? My eyes are closing on me.  I've learnt that some parents are over-protective of their children to the extent that it becomes wrong. If a boy defies a teacher's instruction, whether he was in the wrong initially or not, he is in the wrong. The teacher then has the right to reprimand the boy. Over-protective parents dilute  and justify their child's actions and reprimand the teachers for doing their jobs. They should have a "COPS" like show for this. They should call it, "WHEN PARENTS FIGHT BACK".   I'm glad I know right from wrong.  I saw Zel in school on Thursday. Went to say hi to her whilst she was on the payphone calling one of her parents to pick her up. I never really understood that when she had a cellular in her bag. She hardly carries it in her pocket. I like the way it wobbles when we spun it with our fingers. So anyway I said hi and she gave me a look. Her eyes spoke. The windows to the soul say a million things at once. What the hell are you doin here. Don't talk to me. Get lost. Not him again. I want to believe that I'm imagining things. You kinda know that your life sucks when you want to believe that you're wrong.  You know when boy likes girl, boy falls truly madly deeply with girl, boy cant breathe when he sees her or gets hurt by her? She's right, I watch too much TV and live in my fantastical dreamworld. That happened. I saw her look and walked away unable to breathe. Thought about her the rest of the day. HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT A SIMPLE LOOK DOES THAT TO YOU! WHY!?!?!?  Today too. Yap, Yong, Ken and I went to westmall. We walked into food junction. I was the first. I saw Zel sitting there with her family.  Rachel looked me in the eye. It was SHOCK. It was absurd and weird the way I reacted. It was an immediate reverse. I didn't even stop. I just convulsed backward. Yap saw and told me how adverse my reaction was. To grabbed the boys and said let's not eat here then stumbled outside. WHY DID I DO THAT? Did I not want to disrupt family time? Or make her upset? What! My chest constricted and I couldn't breathe again. It wasn't my chest. It was my heart. That which keeps me alive kills me. Thought about her for the rest of the night too.  Went to see the day after tomorrow. Was good. 3.5 stars. Will watch latest potter release tomorrow with FMSS debate. Weird and I don't belong but Zel's going and Miss Luah asked me to..  Sleep now. Hazel dreams.
