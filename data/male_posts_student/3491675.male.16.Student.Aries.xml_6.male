It's sad how my brain works usuallly during class im daydreaming or staring of into space, but when im summer school (this has been the first time ive been in summer school) im like okay here you go is this right? anf they're=teacher is yes, yes this is right and everyone else is like can yo uhelp me with this while i have ffelings of grandour thinking why can't i function this smart during the regular school year *tear*. Anyway guess what? I made a new friend ,i have a good feeling about him, im starting to rant, anyway Anadol(i think's that's what it's called) makes the day go faster and more concentrated and energised, it's not just for people with add anymore.                  0
