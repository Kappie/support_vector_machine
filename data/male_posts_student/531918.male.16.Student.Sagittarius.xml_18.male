On this monumental day a few hundred years ago, America threw off the oppressive shackles of the tyrannical English overlords, and won her freedom by throwing sacks of tea into the ocean, and setting traps just like the ones the Ewoks made in  Return of the Jedi .  We celebrate this great day by drinking a lot of beer, getting sunburned, shooting off dangerous fireworks into the sky and sometimes at each other, depending on how intoxicated we are.  Unfortunately, many Americans don't even know why they are lighting those snakes on the sidewalk and sticking flags in their ears.  Most of the public is ignorant when it comes to the history of this great nation.  Even in rotten old rainy England, when they are not too busy ejaculating over Harry Potter, they teach about how they got totally owned by the colonists, big time.  It's really a shame and I think knowing about the American Revolution should be required for a citizenship, driverâ€™s license, and forklift certification.   Have a safe holiday weekend.  I go to camp tomorrow.
