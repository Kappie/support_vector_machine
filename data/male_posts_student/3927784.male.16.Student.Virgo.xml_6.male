Well i just didnt like the way that freewebs.com was set up, so i thought that i'd find a new place to write my thoughts, views, and opinions. Yes i know that i've kind of stopped recently, but thats because i've got writers block, and the things that happened with Joe and Mark.    But anyway, this is my new website, and i think that it will be easier to use without it driving me up the wall with anger!   The summer hols are coming up soon, so i'm guessing so far that i wont be having that much inspiration to write from. But hopefully some good things will happen over the hols and i can write a full length column.  Tommorow (maybe) i'll be writing about First Aid week, or as i'm going to call it, Anger management week. I'll explain why tommorowm hopefully, because i'm going to dedicate my life to this column, providing people read it!   Mail me at :  grand_master_jebus@hotmail.com
