But with this post, I want to reflect on a few things. Most of all, given the experience of yesterday evening, I am contemplating how much my life has changed in the last year or so. A lot of things that I used to be completely against (or, put another way, things I wanted to do but the thought of which completely freaked me out) are now almost routine. Routine might be a bit of an overstatement, but they do seem to happen with a certain ease that at one time would have been extremely disturbing. I've lived in Austin over a year now (official one-year anniversary: August 2nd); this is the first year of my life that I've lived on my own, "as an adult." I've supported myself financially, with very little help from my parents (and that was only recently); I've successfully completed a year of graduate school, with good grades; I've made good friends, had a lot of great experiences, traveled to London, and certainly I've learned a hell of a lot about myself. The question is, where do I go from here? How do I work on the things I see in myself that need improvement? How do I make more friends? How do I become more comfortable with the person I am and the person I'm becoming? How do I reconcile what I used to be, and what I always imagined myself becoming, with who I am, and who I want to be now? After all...who am I? And what do I want to be? And what is causing all this confusion? I know what you'll tell me...I need to loosen up, enjoy myself more, be more confident, and work harder to take control of my life. I know this is true. I need my life to move in a new direction...in any direction, period. I don't want to feel like I'm drifting anymore. And I don't want someone else to tell me how to do that...I want to figure it out for myself. But that doesn't mean I won't listen. I'm ready. What have you got to say?
