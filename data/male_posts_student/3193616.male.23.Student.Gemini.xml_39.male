Today morning when we were in the summit meeting about the "Loga-Ishaemam", we got into a dual as to who will win the match today. Invariably the match was loaded( Atleast I thought so) in favour of Portugal. So, I bet him that Greece would win (True to the name of the blog). Out of over-confidence, he bet me a 200/100 deal for Greece win and a 100 win on portugal win. Nou, Midnight masala-100 Bucks. Viola!!!!!!!!!!!!!
