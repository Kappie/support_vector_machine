I feel like the whole week since last Saturday was here to set me up for the reality of today.  If the answer is no, I will move on.  It will take time to heal.  Probably a long time, and things can never be this way again.  If the answer is yes, then I feel things still cant be the same, well, at least not how it was.  It can become better or worse, but I dont want these recent feelings to stay the same.  I feel so weak right now.  Im so confused.  I just want this world to go away...  On a positive note, the people have spoken (Motor Safari that is) and the Zoo director would not let Jullee leave.  Things are the way they were over there...  For now anyways.
