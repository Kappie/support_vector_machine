[[to the tune of “My Favorite Things” from The Sound of Music]]  “The Things You Can Do”  Save spotted owls,  From corporate pollution,  Innocent prisoners,  From wrong execution, Help the old woman who lives in a shoe,  These are a few of the things you can do . . .     Rescue small children,  From parents who beat them,  Save all of the chickens,  From people who eat them,  “Stop Prisoner Rape,” real foundation, it’s true  These are a few of the things you can do. . .     Go to the Congo,  And fight some oppression,  Save Catholic youngsters,  From priests in confession,  Fight for an Gay Female Blind Asian Jew These are a few of the things you can do. . .    When the rent’s due,  When the heat’s off,  Ramen’s all you eat,  Simply remember the good you can do,  And then getting paid… can’t compete….  Help rich white businessmen, Lie to a jury Poison the rivers, Ohio, Missouri  Chop down big trees and turn ponies to glue These are a few of the things you can do . . .     Kick pregnant women, And squash people’s freedom Choke peaceful animals Then we can eat ‘em Bring down the many To raise up the few These are a few of the things you can do     Fight to end hunger  By binging and purging  Help wealthy companies  Finish their merging,  Say it’s pro bono but let them pay you These are a few of the things you can do. . .    When the rent’s due,  When the heat’s off,  Ramen’s all you eat,  Simply remember the good you can do,  And call up the firm… down the street.
