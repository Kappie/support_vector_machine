Just because the dinosaurs could not adapt in this world doesn’t mean that we human can’t adapt either. Mr. Paudel should finish his essays today because it is his responsibility to finish one essay a day. Since, he skipped doing one essay; he is being punished by given 3 essays to complete. Mr. Paudel really enjoys watching television, watching movies and especially playing that game, Grand Theft Auto. If he does all of his assignment today there is a greater probability that he is going to get to play the game, Grand Theft Auto in the future. Bibek can do whatever he wishes to do; this is just a suggestion from his brother.
