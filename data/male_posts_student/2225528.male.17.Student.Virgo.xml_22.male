	 
      for the first time since this year.. today, I was late..  went to my aunt's place after school yesterday till late midnight since no one's willing to bring me home.. spent a ridiculous 12 bucks for a cab ride back.. apparently I guess that's the main reason why I was late for school today.. my usual handphone alarm clock wasn't set and my brain was still unfortunately sleeping..  school was boring.. learnt nothing.. spent most of the time talking in class ignoring the existence of the teacher.. first exam's this friday and I have yet to even touch the pages of my math, even looking at it seems impossible..  tomorrow... another day to live.. today... another day to end..
