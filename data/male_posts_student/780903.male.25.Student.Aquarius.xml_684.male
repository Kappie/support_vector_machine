He's talking about his new book, which contains transcripts of conversations he had with world leaders during the 1973 Syria-Egypt-Israel conflict and the 1975 Vietnam-US conflict.  Not to take anything away from Dr. Kissinger, but it seems awfully easy to "write" a book that's simply a transcript of his conversations.  Since they were all tape-recorded.  No, obviously this is interesting stuff to people interested in this stuff.  Kobe Bryant is writing a similar book.  [Imagine that right here is a transcript of what a Kobe Bryant conversation would be like.  Whatever you can imagine is probably funnier than whatever I can think of, so I won't even try.]  Don Zimmer is writing a similar book too:  DON ZIMMER: "I don't like that Pedro Martinez guy.  His head's too small." YANKEES PITCHING COACH MEL STOTTLEMYRE: "Look at that, Don.  Everyone's rushing out on to the field." DON ZIMMER: "I think I'll go beat up Pedro.  Here I come!" MEL STOTTLEMYRE: "Be careful, Don." DON ZIMMER: "I hate you, Pedro." PEDRO MARTINEZ: "Your head is so big." DON ZIMMER: "All the better to---" PEDRO MARTINEZ: "Bye, bye, Don." DON ZIMMER: "I'm rolling--- and I can't get up."     P.S. There's an interesting post about the different types of weblogs over  urlLink here  at the Civil Procedure weblog.
