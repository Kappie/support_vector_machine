It was just some simple instant pasta ( Macaroni and Cheese ), but it still required some skill at least =P It turned out not too bad. It wasn't as tasty as i expected though. I guess i added too much milk. Oh well , there's always a next time. Lip Zhun fried the fish fingers and Kafaii.....umm....... washed the dishes. Oh waiit he did cut some onions. And he cut them into real big chunks. Yummm......I HATE ONIONS !!! I also found out that my cup cracked for no obvious reason , so i had to walk all the way to Kafaii's place to borrow a cup later that night. How sad.....
