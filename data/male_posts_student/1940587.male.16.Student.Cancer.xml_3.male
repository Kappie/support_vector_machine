(. that was total shit.. once again).. Tuesday.. nothing really just hw.. Wednesday not too much.. jus gotta do lots of hw.. that i'll miss for thursday and friday.. Thursday. I gotta go to Riverside Highschool to learn Layout for the year book.. *not too much fun* anyway.. I guess its cool cuz i don't have to pay the $50 for the 2 day seminar... but then after that I got Student parliament stuff again. GRADE 9 NIGHT>> GRRR.. Minor niners.. anyway.. I gotta help out.. so practically.. im out from 7 in the morning to 9 pm at night.. doing stuff that i wouldn't necessarily say are *Fun*.. on friday.. i gotta go to Riverside at 7 then come home.. and probably start my hw since im going to have a shit load of it.. *crap*.. Plus I got 2 tests and to study for..   Thats the end of the school problems..   Now.. Confusion at its best.. What ppl say and what ppl do.. DAMN HYPOCRITE!!!!!. I wish people could be straight forward.. Im Nice.. .. *most of the time* .. and I'll tell ya .. Im not the type that hides stuff.. but I hate when people will toy with your mind.. ( I know my brains the size of a pea.. but still ITS NOT A Damn Toy.. .. :P..).. well.. all in all. I just wish.. I can get on wit life.. wit this stupid confusion...   ColdAsFire
