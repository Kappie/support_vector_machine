Last week, at this time, I was at home trying to decide which movie I would watch before going to bed, and to day I am only 5 kms away.  5 kms.... seems a lot more than that. In the last few days, i have made lots of friends, some of their names, i don't even know yet...  some others, I know...  Last night we had our first experience of Intro with our seniors... Can't really say what happened... It's out of the rules... Will get back asap... See you Maloy
