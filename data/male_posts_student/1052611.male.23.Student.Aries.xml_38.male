It is just that I haven’t been able to find the time to sit down and actually WRITE something and of course there is also the possibility that I have gotten as lazy as I could get in recent times but ah well, why look at the demoralizing side effects of summer vacations.  I for one am in awe of holidays. They are in a world of their own. They STAND out. Days of complete leisure, a slow uptake on everything that comes your way and other things of this caliber are what holidays are all about. Trust me to see the bright side of the whole thing two days before school reopens. Last week I was probably cribbing about how there was ABSOLUTELY nothing to do. But now, with the prospect of school being 48 hours away, the trees outside suddenly seem like objects in paradise. I might have not minded going back to school and everything. You always get used to stuff like that (thank god for small mercies). But OBVIOUSLY there IS a catch. Right on the reopening day, starting from the English teacher to the principal, everyone is generously handing out these HUMUNGOUS lectures about how we should be completely refreshed after a 50 day break and get ready to hit the books. And of course they also announce the last year board exam results ‘officially’. And it just isn’t my cup of tea to hear about how people blissfully got a freaking 97.999% in class 12th especially because, after hearing about a living example; the whole thing suddenly doesn’t seem too impossible to my parents and the rest of the ‘oh we are your well wishers’ gang and everyone is trying (tactfully) to tell me that I’m supposed to get a score that is something like that even if it is not accurately that. And of course they will NEVER say it straight to my face. They’ll say something like ‘do us proud’ and then I find myself just stuck there.  The power’s been gone since yesterday evening. It is strange really, just a while back I was thinking if I’ll be able to manage without technology and the likes. Well! That is a pretty quick reply I must say. Who the heck except the ghost of Darwin cares about survival of the fittest anyway?  I WANT FAN!  I’ve been reading ‘Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance’ that is to say fitting it between meals and blah. It has been a pretty decent book till now; has some interesting pointers and everything. Otherwise I’m ‘reading’ R.D Sharma- Math for higher secondary; application of derivatives; we even have a test on that today. Constructive way to spend study time, writing about power cuts and so on I must say. Ah well. Okay! It is time to read the omens again. The power’s back, Led Zeppelin’s on in the music system, I have had a good breakfast and reluctantly if I may say so, it is time to apply differentiation.
