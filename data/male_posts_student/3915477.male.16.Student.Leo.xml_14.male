Fri the onli stuff i tink happen in sch 2dae is da kenneth was stil ponderin whether to retake the MT anot.. he at 1st dun wish to retake bt then his mother insist on him to retake it.. on the other hand, mdm lu strong advise kenneth nt to retake even to the extent of nearly bannin him to retake if she realli gt da ability.... i was sorta of a translator between him n mdm lu durin the "debate session"... bt one thing is da i tink da kenneth is realli mummy little boy lol.. he is oredi 17 yrs old oredi.. cant he realli make his own decision of whether to retake anot.. nw he shd be mature enuf n dun cum under family pressure or peer influence animre.. the fate is bein controlled in his own hands, no one can force him wat to do, or wat to said.. He shd be mre grown up abit n handle stuff himself.. jacky is oso same as him.. oso cant realli make a decision of whether to retake anot.. stil haf to ask this n that oso...  haiz.. well...aniwae, it is nt realli my problem oso.. shall nt bother too much as i dun wish to suffer another backstab or watever stuff for bein over concerning again.. it doesnt pays gd to be good.. durin eng lesson receive back my eng test paper... hehe.. was kinda glad da i was actually the highest in my class even though thr might be sum da dun realli bother abt the test.. i manage to get 33/50!! was onli abit disappointed da my marks has drop by 1mark frm the pervious comprehension... went hm aft sch... relax for a few hrs den i went to work liao le.. durin work in the afternoon, i saw shengting on the way hm.. cal her n slightly chat wif her frm far distance frm awhile.. haha.. forget to ask her abt the game da she promised to help mi find a few wks ago.. mi gt a poor memory lol...
