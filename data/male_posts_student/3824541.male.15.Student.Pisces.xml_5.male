I know we all can't be as perfect and prompt as me, but we could all atleast try. Come on ;\.   Anyways, life is still good. I talked to Ms. Sipple today, which rocked! She's getting a dog, and I helped her with info on the breeds. I'm not sure if I really helped, but she told me I did. I guess I get a cookie for that.   Then, I also got to talk to Britt. Brittney's phone service was cancelled (Sad Face). She said that AT has been charging them outrageuous prices. Poor Britt; my prayers go out to her. How will she live?   Then, there's Bri, who is finally back online ;D! Go Bri.   I'm trying to figure out who she thought liked her.   I think there was someone else I was talking to, but ehh ;/. I'll update later.
