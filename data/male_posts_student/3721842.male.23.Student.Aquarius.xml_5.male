(other than porn) if you dont know what i should put here at least say hi to me and let me know that people will actually look at this. i promise to post much more witty, insightful, intelligent, thought-provoking, compelling, smart, fresh, funny, original, and witty, and intelligent, and insightful stuff if i know people are looking at it.  talk to you soon otto
