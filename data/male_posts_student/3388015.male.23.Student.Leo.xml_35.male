Yesterday I woke up really late since I was out really late with Cindy.  So I set my alarm to be about 10 minutes before I needed to leave.  But guess who was running   really   late that day?  Yep, Jake.  He decided he was going to use the bathroom and then shower in the last 10 minutes of my morning, which he knows is when I shave and brush my teeth.  So as soon as he was in the shower, I knocked and went in.  Every time I used the hot water he would sqeel.  It was pretty funny.  Hot water on... Cue Jake.  Hot water on... Cue Jake.  Haha, serves him right to take my bathroom time.
