I love that in America, when you want to enjoy some American food before you leave, you go eat at an Italian place, a Mexican place, an Australian place. And Whataburger (several times).  Today I will say bye to many people and spend this evening doing the last bits of packing. Dad is going to grill something for dinner.  Anyway, I got up kinda early so that I could start getting a bit closer to German time. I am going to eat some Honey Nut Cheerios. Maybe I should put a box of those in my suitcase. I keep thinking "I should bring this with me". Also that cookie cake Becca and Mom made. They need to make me some of those to take with me. But the suitcases are packed, and stuffed quite full! So I hope everyone enjoys all their AMERICAN STUFF a little bit extra on my behalf this year.  Breakfast time.
