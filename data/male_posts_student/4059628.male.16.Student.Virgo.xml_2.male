And since Tuesday was the lucky day for our much awaited Examination, it was undeniably the easiest of all the test series.  It all started with History particularly Asian Civilization. You're right! History! as in H-I-S-T-O-R-Y which requires us to do a lot of mental works and tuning. And not just a simple tune-up. Imagine, lets say the coverage of exam is from Chapter 3 to Chapter 7, and that would result to roughly 100 ++ pages plus tons of photocopied handouts!We have to study it (memorize!) for just a couple of hours! Holy ****!Whatta! Anyway....pass is passed. I accept the fact that I will only get roughly half of the total score...Poor me!  Computer comes next. Although this one didn't require us to peruse our notes, yeah stock knowledge will do, our Professor somewhat made the exam a bit complicated.Think of this, there is a part in the exam which requires us to find errors in HTML tags. If the given tag is correct, we must put a smiley before the number, otherwise we must put an X mark. Okay, there's no problem there.But the funny thing would be the positioning of the syntax or codes of HTML. IT WAS ALL SCATTERED! and RUMBLED! Of course, you might think that majority of my answers are X,well...you're right!   Thank God! after all the pains and sufferings brought to me by the latter subjects which I suppose were the easiest ones, Mathematics seemed to be my savior. After I got a 94% grade, (that means I got 14 correct answers out of 16 questions) it made me feel that I should be proud of myself for having a grade higher than 90%!(the highest that I got prior to Prelims is 90). Hayyyy!  And the last part....   The Inferno......to be continued
