Anyway, I cannot seem to get along with anyone (probably just my sister and dad) over here. And naturally my sister makes a comment about how "I am mean and talk about her behind her back".  She is also really lazy... I tell her she has to do her work, because mom said. And she ends up watching a movie and sitting on her butt!   She has also recently been going on about her cellphone which also pisses me off because when I asked for one just last year my mom said I was to young to have one. So I dont get jack squat and my sister is a total jerk and gets a phone!  *sigh* But I am used to this because it happens all the time.   I have also been very proud of myself cause I have cleaned my room up to the highest standerd possible and am keeping it so.    (Wow this music is relaxing).   I am also in a bit of a...what's the word...rut when it comes to my thoughts because I am trying to think of stuff to draw but can not think, and it is also the same way for my comic...(even though I know what I want to happen I cannot seem to convey the thought properly).  I have also felt a little lonely... I miss a lot of people and I rarely see Rhae because I live relativly far away. And I do not see my regular folk as much cause school is out. (And once again I live farther away from my friends). So it is for this reason that I cannot wait for school to start but I also don't want it to start because it is my last year there...before I am cast out unwillingly into what people call "The Real World."   Well that is everything I can think of to rant on about for now...    ..(-_-)..    Checked by  urlLink Rhae
