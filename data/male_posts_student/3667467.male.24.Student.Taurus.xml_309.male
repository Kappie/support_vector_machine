At least I didn't name it something pretentious, like Porcshe, but I digress. Now, instead of a headshot of actress Ashley Judd, I get to start my computing day looking at the pic of an old, black Frederick Douglass and his big, white Fluffy 'Fro.  Tonight is Ed's first experience with Adult Swim. Congrats Ed! Flying Shark vs. Flying Crocodile: a fight for the ages!  New CD: Upton Sinclair, "WBNY Upton Sinclair ID." I'm ashamed to have ended up with it, but I can't give it back.
