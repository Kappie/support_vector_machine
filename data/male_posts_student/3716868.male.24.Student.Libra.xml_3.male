My rants will be safely vented into the expanse of the Internet to help clear my mind.  Yes, I've hit THAT age. When I was 20, I went on a summer visit to the states (New Hampshire) and after a glorious summer spent underage-drinking (Land of Freedom?!!) and working in a sweetshop, I began to notice my special affinity with The Pudge. Luckily, back then I was less cynical and chair-bound and went straight to the gym to carve some meat off my bones.   Now that I'm older, balder, indeed fatter and at the crucial 23/24 age, drastic measures need to be taken. Step one, regular exercise. Step two, healthier eating.   I'm glad to say that I am eating better these days - I'm making my own food and trying to eat what I need instead of clearing the plate. The regular exercise is slowly taking place thanks to friends of mine. Arranging a jog with a friend substitutes excuses with responsibility. Having a weekly soccer match is both something to look forward to and something to make me feel better.  The problem with my lifestyle is my interests and my work. I'm undertaking a mathematical and computer-theoretic Ph.D. which places me in a chair at a desk for a large portion of the week. My main hobbies are playing guitar and messing on the computer. Since I'm not in a band, I mostly play sitting down... Luckily, it's always possible to take some initiative in your life. That's why this web-log exists - to help me review my progress. My goals for the next year are to get in good shape, work an effective 35-hour week, join a band and de-clutter my life. Pretty boring stuff for a blog!
