They're usually quite interesting  serve to keep people at the lab in touch with what their collegues are doing. Today's presentation was about  urlLink an amazing breakthrough that was recently in the news : Proximity Interconnect. 
  
Rob Drost (with a little help from Ivan Sutherland) gave an overview of the technology  followed it with some fairly detailed (and classified) explanations of how this new design is made possible. Rob is an excellent speaker so my rudimentary knowledge of electrical circuits  rusty knowledge of chip design were sufficient for me to follow almost everything he said.
