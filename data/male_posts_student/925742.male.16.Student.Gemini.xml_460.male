But then it became a skateboard race, right when I got off Simms avenue.  And then some people from school were there, like Franz, and Nick, and some Asian people, and some volunteer people. When we got to the hospital entrance, the place changed and suddenly we were in.. like.... Venice, or some European city with like a water channel and monuments and stone and stuff.  And anyway, I was like, looking at the water, and I exlaimed "LOOK AT THAT GREAT PIXEL SHADED WATER!  Thats shader 2.0!"  Because apparently, in my dreams as well, I'm a giant fucking nerd.  So then Alex was like, yeah!  And I looked at the ground and said "Wow, DOT3 bump mapping!"  And then I explained to Alex what it is, and shit.  And then the Asians started talking in broken Engrish and I started making fun of them with Alex, and we were having a grand time. Then I don't remember anything else of the dream.  I thought I would share that.
