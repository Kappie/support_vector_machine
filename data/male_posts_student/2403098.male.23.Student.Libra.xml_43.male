The weather here in tornado alley is BEAUTIFUL lately and spring is slowly setting up camp.  Cool, breezy evenings after delightfully warm sunny days are making me smile.  I'm not quite ready for the heat of summer, but this will be a fantabulicious spring-time, I can tell already.  I'm excited to clean off my balcony one last time while I live here, so that I can sit and enjoy the monster thunderstorms as they roll in across the plains.  That gave you the visual that my balcony overlooks fields of amber grains, didn't it?  It looks over grassy yard, the parking lot, other apartment buildings in my complex, etc.  STILL, though, it's a wonderful thing to sit outside with a blanket, good company, and more than likely a lil' alcohol during a raging Oklahoma thunderstorm.  I will truly miss the weather here during spring when I move.  Windows open, cool breezes blowing inside, curtains waving, Gary England (meterorologist) cutting into local programming to let me know that Cleveland county is again under a Tornado warning.  I love the rumble in the distance and the smell of the breeze when suddenly a tinge of cool graces the air and you can feel the dampness of an approaching downpour.   I can't wait for the storms to come!  Plus, the calm afterwards is always a freshly cleansed day.  God bless cool weather.  It's definitely nap-time for me.  I had a long long long long night last night.  6:30am comes pretty quick when you're having a good time.  ("For a good time call mason" kinda good time, of course).  Jk.  or am i?  But anyhow, then I woke up at 10am with a throbbing sore mouth from my recent bout with the dentist, and was flat out of Motrin IB.  Off to my medicine cabinet I went, digging through my old shaving kit to find some Hydrocodone leftover from oral surgery last May.  PERFECT!  I popped one of those suckers and went back into a coma.  30 minutes later the phone rings, and Kimberly wanted me to go run errands and go to lunch.  I am SO glad that I did.  Driving with the windows down, listening to the radio was fantastic today.  The weather was "good to be alive" weather, and lunch was perfection.  I'm excited to have finally stopped into the Grapevine cafe.  May I dine there again for that scrumptious sandwich AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN!  I was a bit stoned the whole time, considering I had taken some pretty heavy meds and slept about 4.5 hours, but still, I'd do it all over again.  Can't beat a great lunch, Hobby Lobby, Albertson's Grocery Store and a large Diet Cherry Coke from Classic 50's, now can you?  I dare you.. try to beat it, you cocky bastard.  Speaking of bastards, I need to go to bed.  Before I go, however, I would like to share that recently (today actually) someone reached this very weblog by searching the following phrase in Google.com: "Zoloft ecstasy MadTV."  ROCK ON for that.  I just kinda wonder what they were really looking for.  I love the tracking software.  It's nice to know how someone got to you weblog in the first place.  I wish, whoever that was, had left a comment for me.  Next time you stop by, randoms, say hi.  Ya'll come back now, hear?
