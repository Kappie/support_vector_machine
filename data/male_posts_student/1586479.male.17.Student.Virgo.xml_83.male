I heard last week that a friend from elementary school died in a car accident (not the old friend I've talked about here before). This was shortly after the death of my cat, Hershey. Then I heard of the CCDS graduate who passed away in a car accident.  I see these as deaths in all three steps of time. The first, an old schoolmate, is my past. The second, my cat, my present. The third, the graduate, my future. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to learn from these deaths. One from my past, my present, and my future. Maybe I'm over-analyzing this, but it is very peculiar that all these deaths happened so close together.  If poetic symbolism holds true, I should soon witness a rebirth of some type.  I just hope I realize it when it comes.  I just hope its not foreshadowing.
