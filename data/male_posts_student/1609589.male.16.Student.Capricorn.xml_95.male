I took the hose out, and i expected to have to tug more, and when it came out easily, i dropped it, and it made this note... it sounded awesome... so i picked it up, and hit it... same note. Hit it on the end of it, sounded even better... and I thought "This is my material for my PVC instrument.... heheheheheeh"  I found a paddle-like thing in the kitchen that came with the rice cooker, I'm gonna buy 6 more of them to use as paddles(i'll prolly make the 3 person one), and a couple mouse pads to savage and cut so the paddles will be softer. I did hit it with a mouse pad and it made an awesome sound, so i figured i'd put 2 and 2 together....
