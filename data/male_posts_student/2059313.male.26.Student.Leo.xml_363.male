There they saw an amazing, live, upbeat performance by some of the greatest musicians around... Barenaked Ladies!   This concert was incredible.  It started off with this girl (Butterfly Boucher) playing guitar and singing... she was awesome, and she had an accent.  Talking with one of my friends, I said that the fact that she's holding a guitar, and has an accent makes her 50 times more attractive than most girls.  Up next was Howie Day... he was pretty good too.  I remember liking his music, but I can't - for the life of me - remember any of the songs he played or what kind of sound he had... I guess I was still thinking about Butterfly Boucher, or maybe I was distracted by other goings-on... who knows.   And then the creme de la creme, the band we were waiting for arrived onstage.  Those guys are so energetic, lively, and quick-wits abound.  A couple of my favorite moments from the concert were ( moment 1: ) when they did an adlib song about Lexington, KY, and Steve talked about how KFC was changing it's name to Kitchen Fresh Chicken (which is dumb)... and that apparently we now lived in Lexington, Kitchen.   And then to begin his adlib, Ed busted out "You lost the chicken, but you still got the bourbon."   Moment 2:   They have a song called Shopping, which talks about... gasp.... shopping.  They did some shopping-cart-ography for this song and the screens switched to an overhead camera view and the guys were doing faux synchronized swimming... it was awesome!   Moment 3 : The guys did an acoustic set which included the hit song One Week, and a song called Roadrunner (which IS about THE famous roadrunner and coyote).    And I wouldn't be a very good person if I didn't mention that the LIGHTING for the concert was incredible!  Everything fit with the songs, and it really added to the experience.  Not one disappointing moment for me from this concert... well, I can think of one, but it wasn't about the bands.   But one of the best parts of the whole event is who I got to share it with.  And I'll never trade these memories for anything.
