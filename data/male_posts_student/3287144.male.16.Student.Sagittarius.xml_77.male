Truly thrilling and after I could take as much of that as I could I went back to the people...   After hearing the elder residence of Shropshire comment how much I have grown over the years for about five minutes straight I was driven back to my game of pouring 7 Up. What a great day huh?   Anyway that will be all for now.
