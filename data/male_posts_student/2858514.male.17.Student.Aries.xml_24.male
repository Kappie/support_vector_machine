In my school, the F.6 subjects choices are: Physics, Biology/Pure Mathematics, Chemistry/Computer Studies. As I'm very weak and have no interest in biology, I'll definitely choose Pure Mathematics. And I'll also choose Computer Studies sinceI love this subject very much. If unluckily I have to study F.6 in another school, I won't feel frustrated to study Chemistry as I also like Chemistry.  Heard fromsome F.6 students, A-level syllabus is very demanding and much harder than CE. So I think I need to work hard and revise every day. This summer I've been lazy enough, and I'll work hard in F.6!
