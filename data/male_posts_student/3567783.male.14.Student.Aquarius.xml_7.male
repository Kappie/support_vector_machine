I entered the kitchen to get a cup of water and I found out that no one was there. Weird, no?  And then, Silent Hill. This town is controlled by a god named Samael. Any one who has sinned, when he or she enters this town, will see illusions of weird, sick, twisted monsters, giving psychological impact to torture his or her mind. The town could switch to different "worlds", or dimensions. You might come to the town and everything looks normal, but then suddenly, everything seems to get dark all of a sudden, or the town seems to be rusty, bloody and ugly. Interesting ideas...  Ever heard of the Camera Obscura?  "It's a camera that could capture supernatural phenomenon that couldn't be seen with the naked eye.  It was designed to photograph visions of the past and spirit entities, but it was a prototype and its functions hadn't been fully tested. Photographing "things that ordinary people couldn't see" with this camera had an exorcismal effect."     The above and below statement were taken from a Fatal Frame II Plot Analysis by Haruji Sora.  The Crimson Sacrifice -------------------------  Conditions for Crimson Sacrifice to be a success (in my opinion):- -> The "elder" (in their tradition term, modern term would be the younger one)    must strangle the other to death. But sometimes the kill is not done by    the "elder" one, and the Veiled Priest would instead help to end it (refer    to Violet Diary 2). But the strangling must be done though, and the    "younger" must feel pain (maybe the more pain the better, just like the    Kusabi ritual). -> After the ritual, a crimson butterfly must appear at the neck of the    sacrificed one. -> The Remaining would remain in the human world, while the Crimson Butterfly    would flutter down the X, appeasing it. And then later it comes back and     flutter around the village (on certain times, not visible at all times) -> The sacrificed one must willing to do the sacrifice. The one who do the    sacrifice doesn't matter. Azami is willing to be killed by her sister,    Akane. Mayu was willing too, as seen in the Crimson Sacrifice ending. The    sacrificed one also must not be disagreeing with the Ritual, or at least    don't know what the ritual is about (Azami was too young back then, so she    probably don't know what's the nature of the ritual. She only wants to be    part of Akane, and Akane to kill her) -> The one who did the sacrifice must have at least some sort of small    resentment to the other twins, Akane had a resentment to Azami because    she doesn't want to kill, but Azami insisted that she do it. Mayu's was    a success because deep in her heart, she resented her sister for being a    burden to her since the accident. -> I also think that this Crimson Sacrifice Ritual might also be very similar    to the Inner Ritual (The Kusabi). The more the twins suffer, the better    the effect would be. The "younger" one would suffer physically (strangling)    and the "elder" one would suffer emotionally. As you can see, most of The    Remaining suffer alot emotionally, some had their hair turn white, some    shunned away from human contact. Akane suffered massively, and Mio too    suffer at the Crimson Sacrifice ending, where she is bewildered on what she    did AFTER the Butterfly appear.     Creepy, no? Will you perform the sacrifice if you're in either position as the elder twin or younger twin? Will you kill your own twin to save others?
