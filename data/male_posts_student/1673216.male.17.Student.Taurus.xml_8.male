I don't think that is enough for a growing boy like me, but I was having too much fun talking to people (you understand, I knew you would). First thing I did was wake up at 9.00am, and then immediatly start getting ready. I then went to a soccer clinic (for goalies more specifically), and worked hard for 3 hours. Now this, although tiring, was a lot of fun. After this I continued with my schudule for the day, which said that I was going to Victor's for ping pong (WITH MY BRAND NEW CARBON BASED 2-SPEED SUPER SPIN PADDLE WITH A NICE KITTY CAT ON IT :D). So I go there and play some hardcore table tennis for about 4 hours, and also play on the computer for about 2 hours. Now if this wasn't busy enough, I had some major fun at the house. I got to drive my sister back and forth (Been waiting to do that for WEEKS) and then I finally get to sit down. So I think about posting another blog, and consider not because it might delete it. Accually, this post was about to be deleted, I could feel my computer about to shut down. Luckily, I closed some programs and am not using -less- then 100% of the CPU. So now I sit here typing about ping pong and the like... Speaking of which, this is no normal ping pong.. Nono, this is ping pong with a white guy holding the paddle like an asian and an asian holding it like a white guy. So you get a 'cultural melting pot' so to speak :D. If I had to make a list of my 5 favorite things about playing pingpong with Victor, it would go about like this (IN NO ORDER!! ::shakes fist::)  1. Crowing Roosters  2. Roberto Carlos'  3. Hiccups  4. Edges  5. Wrist flick  If this makes sense to you, have a cookie. If it doesn't, you can ask me about any of them, or just pretend like you get it so that you can have a cookie...  Me and Scott were about to call four people to see if they wanted to go to a movie (inquire if you think this is you) at Hopkins for a dollar... Identity was the name, hacking was its game (see also, hax0r). Howeeverrr, we chickened out and decided not to :D. Maybe some other night I guess. But I really want to keep my streak of 5 movies a week up =Ãž... Anyways, so what I did instead is play Monsters and Me... My five favorite things about this MMORPG (Ask if you don't know what that is) are:  1. Actions with my turtles!  3. Turtle power!  4. The Turtle Army (TA)  5. Making a huge line of turtles to overpower all the other turtles in all the land  I skipped two in case you didn't see.... I'm out of twos, if you sell me some I will reward you greatly! So what is Monsters and Me? Its a role playing game basically, and everyone gets a pet and you just fight stuff to make you and your pet a higher level. I'm quitting the year of Revelation that I played, and starting this game up (Unless I get invited to movies, there isn't anything to do at night :P). So now I sit here, level 55 with a level 67 pet (It's a turtle...no joking) wondering why me and Scott didn't set up that movie... ::eats some oranges:: . Another thing about this week (Another? What was the first? ::shrug::) is that I had soccer every. single. day. On Monday, I was the ref for two 12 year old games (Oh ya, this was in the downpour, and I slicked my hair back to be more professional :D). On Today o.o I had that goalie clinic. Tomorrow I have another practice. Thursday I have a game against St. Cloud. Friday I have an independant practice. Saturday I have another team practice... Sunday we will have John practice I hope...in the rain... Speaking of soccer in the rain, that is where my happiest moment in life came accually..  About a month ago, we had John practice. We played World Cup (A game duh :D) and I was goalie. At first I was mad because there was this HUGE puddle of mud (the object not the band) and I didn't feel like diving in it with my white shirt. Then it began to rain. Oleg got the ball about 5 meters out and I was just like 'Ok there is no way I am letting Oleg score now,' so of course I dive and fall right in the mud puddle. Luckily it started to rain harder, and I didn't care anymore. So I dove (Dove? Dived? Diven? Divededen? O_o) all over , and I was playing really really well. The satisfaction that comes from denieing people from scoring their precious goals is unbelievable :D. So, after it was all over here is what I looked like:  1. As if I had third degree burns all over my legs and arms  3. As if I wore a black shirt to practice  4. As if I wasn't a simple Anglo-Saxon anymore  5. As if my shoes where blocks of black concrete  Everytime I kicked the ball I sprayed a huge rooster of mud at everyone... they were all getting so mad that they couldn't score... That's so far the best feeling in my life.  ::hugs Blog::
