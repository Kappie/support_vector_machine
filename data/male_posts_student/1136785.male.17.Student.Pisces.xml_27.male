My second thought was "Oh, so  that's  why I luck out with women"   But I'm glad someone is here. I'm not sure how I feel about Christyn using my chatterbox to pick up anonymous internet strangers. Might as well go for it though; his IP is owned by KCnet, a provider based out of North Kansas City. Ass is ass christyn. Does this make me like an internet Pimp? Sweet. I can die with one of my dreams having come true - pimping out teenage girls through the medium of the world wide web. If I can't get any, for reasons that are apparent, I can at least vicarously enjoy making sure other people do. Hah, I'm a tool.   Volunteered again today. We almost didn't make it, as they changed locations and we didn't know where. But we got there right when they started serving. It was nice.  God damnit - why do I keep ending up at Beta. Such a fucking pit. And why did I spend more time with the girl? She followed me, and we went all around New Haven. I took her to Beta because she wanted to go in that whole "Well we don't have to if you don't want to" I think she just wanted to see a frat house. But I can't allow anything to blossom. A summer fling with a girl I'm not interested in is not only deceptive, but cruel. But openly rejecting her is cruel. Why can't I basically be friendly and nice to her and nothing more. I simply do not want to become that sadistic asshole who hurts people again, and help drive another girl into depression. I want to be decent for once.  Whoa I'm emo.  At least I can find faith in a  urlLink real american hero.    I'm kind of annoyed with this random format. I liked it more when I did my big "Boring, yet important" political diatribes and news links. Made me feel important. I'll start doing that again when I have more time.
