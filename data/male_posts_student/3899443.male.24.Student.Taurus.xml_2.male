While those who love me call me a cynic, especially when it concernsall things related to the Christian subculture, I do believe there are authors, musicians, artists, etc. within this subculture who are doing some good things. Instead of always bashing the pathetic aspects of the culture, I think I'll try highlighting some things I like. (Note: I'll keep bashing the bad things of Christian retail. It's just way too fun.)   I recently read a book by Donald Miller called   urlLink Blue Like Jazz .  I actually loved it. The book is a very easy read. It is very much a stream-of-consciousness account of the author's spiritual journey. It's not a perfect book, but I found myself unwilling to put it down. It was just too honest, and I have to respect that. This book won't change the world, but it could make you realize there are Christians who care about the world. I would recommend it for high school or college students who grew up in the stereotypical whitebread Christian youth group.
