Gaggles of giggly girls everywhere, standing around talking about the clothes they just bought, looking pretty and not looking at me. I know there are all kinds of stores, but I prefer to go to those outside the mall, the ones that don't leave me feeling lonely and depressed. Not that I really care what these girls think. I don't. But every so often I see one with red hair, and she'll remind me of Scarlett. And I couldn't have that. Not when I was so close to getting my life together.  Sorry, I'm getting off track. Anyway, Jason wanted me to come with him to an electronics store in the mall to look at some gadget he wanted. Since I'm the "rich" one, he figures I can afford to get him one for his birthday. Truth be told, I probably could. Mygrandpa owns ... most of the city. My Dad won't accept any money from him, so I take it myself behind his back. I want for nothing, dad still feels like he's being defiant, and no ones the wiser. Sorry, off track again. Anyway, I walk in the door and who should I see but, yup, you guessed it, Scarlett. I didn't feel like plunging into another six months of depression, so I decided to avoid eye contact and walk briskly past. Well, Jason ruined that plan.  "Hey Scarlett!" he says. She turns to look at us. Scarlett is named for her hair. Beautiful, flaming red hair. Down to her butt. Gets me every time. She stares at me and its like I can't move. I can't do anything but look at her.  "Hey Jason!" she starts. Then she sees me. "Ian?" she says. She runs up and hugs me. It's too late now. Another month of therapy down the drain. "I've been trying to get in touch with you all summer! Did you change your phone number or something? And your e-mail? And I don't think I had your IM right. It's junkmaster06, isn't it?"  "Yeah" I say. Now what? I can't tell her I've been avoiding her. I can't lie with Jason right there. I closed my eyes and prayed for some sort of distraction. Well, I guess someone up there likes me cause that's exactly when the men in black showed up.
