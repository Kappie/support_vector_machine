I fell in love with Ben Folds last night...If I were gay I would marry him....but I am not...and I don't think he is either...and i never will be gay cause...being fucked up the ass...just makes me shudder...but hey...if that's your style, go for it dude...nice to know that instead of ass raping me, a gay guy could just be with a guy like you and not have to ass rape me...y'know? ok i bet i lost a bunch of people...but if I were gay...Me and Ben Folds 4ever   I have to go question my sexual orientation now...adios  "Fred sits behind his desk in the dark." -Ben Folds   yes, I am kidding for all those people who think I am a homosexual now...not that there is anything wrong with being a homosexual
