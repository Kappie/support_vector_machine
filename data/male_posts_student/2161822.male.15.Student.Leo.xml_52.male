But then again I live in Hazleton where you have to make your own entertainment with various things you find around town. (i.e. chained town picnic tables, abandoned cars with dead people in them, various boxes lying in the middle of the street,..etc.) It's such a shame it's so cold out. Maybe if I could snowboard or ski it might be a little better but since my skills are limited to talking and running around like a moron it leaves me little to do when the weather is this bad. I really hope we get a delay or something this week. School drags out so long. Today's history class was interesting though. We had a guest speaker from the Army tell us stories about life in the army. Very exciting. After hearing her I don't think I ever want to go into any armed services. So here I am sitting here listening to music and I don't know what else to write about. Like I said my life is pretty much the same things just repeated in different order. Music can either calm me down or make me so annoyed that I rip the radio off the table and toss it out the window. This music that causes the rage in me to escape is R If you're not bored by the same beat over and over and over again you'll be annoyed hearing some "thug" talk about his woman. To name a few, I extremely hate Usher, those B2K morons and every other R artist alive. Anyway...After great strategery, the Knicks have acquired Stephon Marbury, Penny Hardaway, and some tall dude. Although Marbury got off to a slow start, he's returning to his usual 20+ point and 10+ assists games. The Knicks are on their way to a good future. Thank you Zeke. I wish that Hafey wasn't so stupid. In the Chemistry lab for example, for labs we have to mass some things. Well we only have maybe two balance beams that actually are calibrated right. The rest don't work and give you wrong results and Hafey is too poor to buy new ones. And you just have to love Hafey's heating system. But it's life.  Listen to H.I.M.
