It's just... i cannot find any words to describe this. I just have a couple of words that come to mind in this situation... DAMN! ooooooooooooooooo SHIT!!!!!!!!! WOW, yah there it is, the word that describes this situation perfectly, WOW! And i never use that word wow, just like i don't use the word beautiful, gorgeous or sexy, but why beat around the bush, those words are now re-enstated in my vocabulary, because what i used to say to a girl isn't enough in this situation.  WOW.  And speak of such, ive been tryin to get some things together. What happened to me from before, i don't get it? It was so much easier back home, but here seems so much different. It used to come naturally. Am i getting out of touch? whoa, that thought is too shitty to even take into consideration. I hate that though, i can help other people in these kinda situations but i cant help myself! Damn! This brings something to my attention, i will get this done, no matter what, whether i die trying or roll with my winnings i will do this, and that is a Soungie promise, mark my words. A Soungie's promise in my words, is stronger than a man's promise, and i dont lie to myself. I will do this. My goal doesn't seem to bite or bitch, so why am i so jittery and nervous? I will do this, i will...
