Timeshare:: Sharing time  Accounts:: Multiple  Temptation:: Evil  Hack:: -ing  Shadow:: Puppets  Infection:: Disease  800:: + 800 - 800 * 800 / 800 = 800  Infidelity:: Not fidel  Springfield:: Illinois  Gardener:: Plants    I shall not be online as often. I unplugged my computer. I have my reasons. I am typing this from my parents computer and I will probably post something every other day, when I have web page and on Saturdays or Sundays, pending on my mood. I hope you enjoyed your little piece of Colin. I would love to wish you a great week. I will post again Tuesday, which just happens to be my permit test. (maybe tomorrow if I don't have anything to do).
