I have the table made but the problem is that I have a large banner at the top so the table is offset. I have to cut the image up so I can make everything fit nicely. I'm going to start doing that really soon.  I forgot how much fun web design can be.  I haven't had any websites since those that I made when I was younger. There was one for 4x4 Evolution, an offroading game that I used to play, and one for video games in general that my friend and I tried to set up. They all have failed. This one probably will too.  One thing that I'm doing differently, though, is I'm setting everything up, getting some content, and then I may buy a domain and a hosting plan from Dreamhost.  I have chosen Dreamhost because Chad Paulson, the Project Manager of the  urlLink Warp Pipe Project  had possitive feedback. There is also a affiliate program where you can earn $65 for each referral you get. If this is actually true, I figured it was an opportunity to get a domain and a good hosting plan, while at the same time, support the Warp Pipe Project, and all their great efforts.  Well, I'll let you know if I ever buy a domain.
