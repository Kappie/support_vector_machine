But the question is was what happend right, or was it one hell of a screw up. One part says it was right, the rest says it was wrong. If i hadnt have done it then what could have happened, i dont know and i dont want to think about it. I came to a decision, a split in the road, to the left was to continue on and just act like i was fine, which i was not, to the right was to do what i did. I knew that i would probably regret it either way and that it was going to cause problems either way, but the choice had to be made. But all that can be done is to live with the choice i made, nothing more and nothing less and not to pretend that what happend did not actually happen. Nobody knows what could have happend if they had made a different choice, and each of thoes not only affects them but it also affects thoes around them indirectly, some for the better and some for the worse. We just have to live with each of the choices we make and hope that in the end everything turns out ok in a fashion.  Well i think that is enough of my just procrastinating for the moment  TJT
