Honeybee  Thoughts of a clean frozen river of metal cutting a path Directly into my skin are haunting my mind again Like some recurrent nightmare from hell That doesn’t want to see its one potential convert Denying its existence, and making it blow away With a sigh, with the wind like some malodor hanging In the slipstream of air as it rushes by my eyes and ears Smelling again of  blood , more  blood , the sap That doesn’t taste so sweet in my mouth, yet somehow I can lick the red drop off my finger and not recoil In the disgust that I should be exhibiting toward That vampire, that leech hiding and feeding off the Benevolent ghosts that seem to shake, shiver, quake When I wake in the middle of the night to a phantom alarm A mystical tune that was never really there to begin with And realize that it sounds like a horrid clash of memories Subconsciously reliving the very fluctuation of that voice As it slips past me in honeyed words that hide the  spark  The subtle spark of awakening, no one has yet found But here I am, trying to wake up from a netherworld That has me on the rack each time I think clearly Eating at the back of my brain, and moving inwards And then it will turn downwards, and chew through My spinal column, and into each organ that creates What I thought to be me, for a long time Some cancer that can’t be diagnosed at any hospital People hate it, and for a damn good reason Because it enervates one, and the afflicted ends up Suffering convulsions by the bathroom sink, and Frantically rubbing his arms to get the circulation To move again, to slice through the debilitating  cold  Because the thermometer is dropping too fast The antithesis of a fever, caused by realization That he is alone, he is different, because only he Will drag the smooth edge of a dagger across his skin And only he will consciously try to escape a crowd And only he crawls into a honeycomb of self-spun Delusions of depression and isolation As a number of other recluses scuttle into the honeycomb To be with him, because they too fear the norm And amongst the aliens, I am blinded in cold flashes Waiting for your voice to arrest my fingers Your lips to melt the  ice  that forms about my eyes I sink into a sleep, with the smooth skin of your hands Even if they are ethereal, and even if just the lull in dreams Resting on my shoulders, passing into my bloodstream The miniscule particles that ward off the virus infecting my Sanity.
