It talks about the age old dispute between atheists and theists on "Does Evil Exist?";    The professor of a university challenged his students with this question: "Did God create everything that exists?"   A student answered bravely, "Yes, he did."  The professor then asked, "If God created everything, then he created evil."   Since evil exists (as noticed by our own actions), so God is evil.  The student couldn't respond to that statement causing the professor to conclude that he had "proved" that "belief in God" was a fairy tale, and therefore worthless.   Another student raised his hand and asked the professor, "May I pose a question?"   "Of course," answered the professor.   The young student stood up and asked: "Professor does Cold exists?"   The professor answered, "What kind of question is that?...Of course the cold exists... haven't you ever been cold?"   The young student answered, "In fact sir, Cold does not exist. According to the laws of Physics, what we consider cold, in fact is the absence of heat. Anything is able to be studied as long as it transmits energy (heat). Absolute Zero is the total absence of heat, but cold does not exist. What we have done is create a term to describe how we feel if we don't have body heat or we are not hot."   "And, does Dark exist?", he continued. The professor answered "Of course". This time the student responded, "Again you're wrong, Sir. Darkness does not exist either. Darkness is in fact simply the absence of light. Light can be studied, darkness can not. Darkness cannot be broken down. A simple ray of light tears the darkness and illuminates the surface where the light beam finishes. Dark is a term that we humans have created to describe what happens when there's lack of light."   Finally, the student asked the professor, "Sir, does evil exist?" The professor replied, "Of course it exists, as I mentioned at the beginning, we see violations, crimes and violence anywhere in the world, and those things are evil."   The student responded, "Sir, Evil does not exist. Just as in the previous cases, Evil is a term which man has created to describe the result of the absence of God's presence in the hearts of man."   After this, the professor bowed down his head, and didn't answer back.    Some people have said that the boy was Albert Einstein.  No one knows for sure.
