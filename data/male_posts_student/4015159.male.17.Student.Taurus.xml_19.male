I went up the stairs to tell a crowd of people in a room we were watching a movie and was met by "Get Out," and "You're a ring piece." Drunks are sooooooo friendly. I went back downstairs to watch the movie hoping it would put meto sleep but it didn't :(.            3:40AM: I was still not asleep, I seem to find it difficult to sleep in a room full of people, School of Rock had finished now and I wasbored...            3:50AM: Sam had put Dogma in the DVD player, after finding it quite boring Me, Sam and Becky had decided to go to the park...            4AM: For the first time in my life I wason the Swings at 4AM in the morning!!! My back was killing and conversation with Becky and Sam was minimal (I think Becky was drunk and depressed:P)            4:30AM: I decided to go back to the house, as I entered someone (who wasn't intending to sleep)was taking up the entire settee, leaving a very small space on the floor for me.            5AM: I'd woken up after a small amount of sleep. People told me I'd been snoring making me very self-conscious, no more sleep.            5AM to 7AM: NO IDEA what happened, definitely didn't sleep though, probably watched a movie...            7AM - 11AM: People had started leaving, meaning only about 8 of us remained. Had some good talks with people though and watched some episodes of Fairly Odd Parents.At 11 I left with Andy D.            11AM - 2PM: Was at Andy D's for most of the time, playing The Sims: Bustin Out on Andy's GBA emulator. Got quite far :D.            2PMish: Just left the asda after a sandwich, phoned a taxi and had to wait 15 minutes. Buses have decided to go on strike you see...            2:30PMish: Got home had a bath, not much stress. Watched some TV, went on the computer etc etc...            4PM: Decided to go and get my sisters dog for a couple of hours. On the way back to mine she sniffed and pulled and sniffed and pulled and sniffed and pulled and sniffed and pulled and sniffed and pulled...            4:30PM - 5:30PM: Tried to have a nap, however I was interuppted by my sisters fiancee and the phone, these only interruptingwhen I'd just DROPPED OFF!!            6:10PM: Sister phones moaning about not having much time to pick the dog up (a hint saying "will you take her back PLEASE!)            6:15PM: We decide to take my dog up to my sisters on the walk, as soon as we get off the drive my sisters dog runs in front of my dog, her lead catches the collar of my dog and opens it. Random D*ckface walks by trying to impress is GF and makes a smarmy comment, if I wasn't too busy watching Andy save my dogs LIFE then I might have heard what was said and belted the guy (good job because I'm not the toughest lad in the world and may have ended up with my face smashed on the floor). Andy saved my dogs life (THANK YOU), but I had to punish the dog by leaving him at home (shouldn't have run away ya see)            That was the peak of my stress for the day, I'd had less than an hours sleep and I was knackered but managed tokeep myself up to watch Big Brother, Will and Grace and Bo' Selecta. Went to bed and fell asleep watching Something About Mary.
