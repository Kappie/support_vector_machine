As I laid in bed I began to feel a stabbing, sour sensation in the pit of my stomach….I lay still trying to find out what type of cramp I was having…My eyes bulged then narrowed as my nose twitched and my mouth jerked from side to side in wonderment…  That’s when it dawned on me…where’s the TOILET?!!!!!  I jumped out of bed and desperately opened my door before jolting to the toilet…  When I was finished I gave out a sigh of relief and exited the toilet…  ‘Those packets of chili powder sure do wonders!’ I said with a whistle and a sigh…WoW!  I patted my stomach and headed towards the kitchen in search of something to eat…  ‘Awww…shit! Who died in HERE?’ I heard Nicky’s disgusted voice as she entered the toilet.  Ignoring her rude comment I continued to walk to the fridge while yawning sleepily…  Rummaging around I found some milk and cereal lying around somewhere…busily I dug into my breakfast, narrowing my eyes to see how many smiley faces I could find in my cereal…there sure were a lot…I’ve never seen so many smiley faces…  I gazed in wonderment while busily munching away on my cereal…  ‘What are you doing Ben?’ Nicky asked me with her voice that made me feel like she was accusing me and saying that I was doing something stupid…  I pondered for a while…come to think of it…she always speaks to me in that tone…hmm...  I shrugged off the idea while busily munching away…  ‘Counting how many smiley faces I can find in my cereal’ I answered casually not bothering to look up at her…  ‘Idiot’ she mumbled  *Whack!*  I gave out an exasperated groan after she hit the back of my head…  ‘What was THAT for?’ I asked her annoyed that she had made me lose concentration…I was up to 31 smiley faces…  ‘You idiot…they’re all smiley faces!’ she said sounding impatient…  What was HER problem…she was the one who made me get the runs…if you know what I mean…and she got the last laugh when she didn’t HESITATE at all to pour all THREE of those chili powder packs into the stupid beans…*sigh*…  ‘How do YOU know that they’re all smiley faces?!’ I counter attacked her…  She gave out a hopeless groan…*sigh*…she wasn’t a very good actor…she only pretended to be angry…I knew so, why you may ask? Well simple. I know all girls…secretly she’s actually dying to kiss me…  ‘You Bimbo! Read the cereal box!’ she spat out desperately trying to get a point through…  ‘Fine then!’ I retorted making sure I rolled my eyes in front of her face…  What was HER problem…sheesh…she’s just going to make a fool of herself…  I picked up the cereal box with my hand while the other was clutching onto my spoon…giving her a nasty look I picked it up while munching the cereal bits in my mouth…  ‘Smiley-O’s’ I read out loudly so she could hear…  ‘Yeah…so?’ I asked her dumbfounded.  ‘Read the bottom you idiot!’ she said again before folding her arms and doing MY pose…the one I called ‘The Cool Pose’  I did as I was told and obeyed like a little boy…  ‘Smiley-O’s…Smile, coz every single Smiley is always smiling back at you!’ I mumbled while skimming through the words…  I looked up at Nicky dumbfounded…was she trying to make a point again?...what was her problem?...here I was minding my own business trying to count how many Smiley faces I could find in my cereal and she hits me on the head for no apparent reason…honestly the brain of this girl is seriously damaged!  Again, she let out a defeated groan before walking away… I stared at her turning figure as she went to retrieve the milk from the fridge…  Shrugging off the incident I returned to busily counting how many smiley faces there could be in my cereal…1…2….3….4….  ‘Where do you keep the milk?’ Nicky’s frustrated voice came back into hearing range…  ‘In the fridge….idiot’ I said mimicking her while mumbling ‘idiot’  I know that you pea brain! There’s only an empty carton of milk in there…where do you store the OTHER cartons of milk?’ she asked me again waving her arms around like a mad woman…  I stared at her confusingly and flabbergasted…what was the weirdo going on about now?  She groaned in annoyance.  ‘Give me your car keys…I’m going shopping’ she said demandingly…while motioning me to throw her the keys with her hand…  Now THAT I understood…no way was I lending her MY car…she would probably run off with it…could she even drive? Was she even educated enough?!  I started having a panic attack…think FAST Ben…she doesn’t like waiting…you’ll get another slap on the head if you don’t come up with an answer…I could hear a clock ticking in my head…beads of sweat dripped from my forehead…  My forehead creased in lines of stress while my eyebrows arched into a frown, my eyes narrowed desperately searching for an answer…  ‘I’m g-g-going…’ I started  ‘Spit it out you retard!’ she commanded at me  ‘I’m…I’m….GOING WITH YOU!!’ I blurted out in one desperate attempt.  I gave out a sigh of relief…now I was free of the stress and pressure…calmly I wiped away the bead of salty sweat that I had formed on my forehead from the ordeal…  My breathing slowly regulated as I took in deep breaths…  ‘Fine!’ Nicky answered before walking towards her room to change…  *sigh*…this was going to be a LONG day…  ‘I’m going with you’…’I’M going with YOU’… ‘NO…I’m GOING with YOU’….I walked and talked to myself while thinking of how easily and swiftly I had managed to dodge another hit from Nicky…*sigh*…I was just too good…and to think…no, I Benjamin Uy…certainly did NOT go into stress or panic at the time…*sigh*…I really was the most talented and calm guy in the world…     CHAPTER 17  [Ben’s P.O.V.] *25th August*  [At the Markets]  I pushed my dark shaded glasses up, making sure that they weren’t falling down…it was pretty cold today…  Following Nicky I walked closely behind making sure that no one had recognized me….I didn’t want to be seen with a pig like her…seeing as how I was CLEARLY the Beauty in this whole crisis….not in a girly way of course…I was OBVIOUSLY manly and masculine…I mean, just look at these bulging muscles!  I pulled my beanie over my head…this was very, very embarrassing seeing as how Nicky had managed to yank A LOT of my hair out and now I had an extremely LARGE bold patch on the side of my head..*Sigh*…   tried dressing casually…but everywhere I went people stared at me…was it because I was dressing too cool for someone with a bold patch and a couple bruises on his face *Sigh*…I must’ve looked like a gangster on patrol….it would explain why I kept glancing around to see if any hot chicks were looking my way…  ‘Hurry up Ben...I’m hungry and I want to buy milk!’ Nicky said turning around with her arms crossed impatiently…  ‘SHhh…SHhH!!’ I shrieked out desperately trying to get her to shut up…  I didn’t want her shouting my dead, sexy name out to everybody in the supermarket…it would give me a bad name if I was taking orders from HER…let alone, following HER…I mean, don’t get me wrong but I am what girls dream of…what they fantasize about…I am their dream hunk…yep…that’s me for you, God’s gift to women…  It’s not that she’s not pretty or anything…she is…believe me, but would it hurt if she acted a bit more feminine and if she made me look a bit more manly and in control..*sigh*…  ‘Don’t you SHHh ME Ben! Get your BUTT here right now!’ Nicky spat out, obviously annoyed and offended.  She stomped her foot on the ground and pointed at her feet forcing me to beckon at her call...  I lowered my head in embarrassment as passer-bys stood and stared at us oddly…  ‘Hurry up will you!’ I hissed at her when everybody had resumed doing whatever they were doing…  ‘You were the one that wanted to come along!’ she accused me.  I kept quiet not wishing to cause a scene…hopefully no one from Crystal Bar was around..*sigh*…so embarrassing they would see…Me… ‘Voted sexiest man alive’ with a simple Bar Girl...how demeaning of me…  We went into the markets and she picked up a carton of milk as well as some groceries and meats…  ‘That’ll be $29.40 thanks’ the counter lady said flatly  I gazed around expecting Nicky to pay; when our eyes met she stared at me expectantly…  I stared back at her refusing to give in…no way was I going to part with MY money…she was crazy!  We got out of the store…Nicky had a bright smile on her face while I slouched and walked carelessly with a glum expression on my face…  You can obviously see who had to pay…*sigh*…  ‘I’m Hungry’ Nicky complained.  ‘Great lets go home and eat’ I said excitedly in a hurry…  ‘No…let’s not go home and eat…let’s eat here’ Nicky replied with a sneer on her face.  Damn! She must have read my mind…*sigh*…no point arguing with the MAN of the house…seeing as how she seems to overpower me 99.9% of the time…urgh…  We reached the food court and she ordered Mac Donald’s for us while I sat down, left with the groceries at a secluded table waiting for the food to come…  When she came back we both ate our burgers devouring the taste…mmm…she was right, it was nice to eat Mc Donald’s for a change…  While we were eating I discovered the most evil plan I had conjured so far…this was going to be good…I smiled constantly…  ‘What the hell’s the matter with you?’ Nicky asked me annoyed at my happy expression…  ‘Nothing…’ I replied before looking in the other direction waiting for the perfect time to strike…  ‘Idiot’ she would mumble…  After we ate I offered to carry the groceries…she got up from her seat and I followed closely behind her…  As I walked behind her I tried my best to look as sad and down as a lost puppy…I walked slowly and lugged the groceries with me…people stared at me and gave out sympathetic whines of pity towards me…obviously assuming that I wasn’t the most happiest person in the world…  Nicky took long, quick steps…occasionally she would glance back at me to make sure I was keeping up with her…  When I was slow enough…she turned around and walked towards me…  ‘Oh stop being a wimp! They’re not THAT heavy’ she grumbled.  I retaliated and held onto the groceries as she reached out to carry them for me…  ‘Let go!’ she whispered with malice  I remained solemn and held onto the groceries with my dear life…  When her force was strong enough I let go of the food and it tumbled onto the floor with a thud…  Everyone stared our way…that was my queue…  I collapsed to my knees and picked up the groceries one by one while giving out soft whimpers and sobs so the whole food court could hear…okay so maybe it wasn’t that soft...but as long as it worked…  ‘What’s the matter? I’ve never seen a full grown man cry before’ a woman approached me full of concern…  This girl was quite cute too…  ‘I can’t say…’ I gave out a little wail…  ‘Shhh…it’s okay…you can tell me…’ she comforted me while the rest of the audience had crowded around me   From the corner of my eye I could see Nicky’s flabbergasted look as she watched everybody walk towards me to see what the commotion was…  ‘Oh…it’s nothing, just the children…they need me…’ I told her in-between sobs…  ‘What children?’ she asked me confused.  ‘The homeless children, I’ve dedicated my life in raising them and sheltering them…they need me’ I sobbed and whimpered creating more effect…  ‘I don’t have enough money…today I was fired…my boss told me that I wasn’t putting enough effort into my work…but I can’t help it, the children need someone to care for them…there’s 5 of them…they’re so young and precious to me…’ I said trying hard to form tears in my eyes…  ‘Oh you’re such a saint!’ the woman cried out in sympathy…  Everyone else cooed at me and told me it was going to be okay…  ‘Today I came to the markets minding my own business and spending my last $30 dollars on groceries to feed those precious little things…and…and…’ I broke down crying again acting more pitiful…  ‘It’s okay…you can tell us…’ the lady said putting a comforting hand on my shoulder as she knelt down beside me and the spilt groceries which were on the floor now…  I wailed and cried like a lost child…by now I had gotten the attention of the employees behind the counter of every food stall…  ‘That...that cruel and heartless woman over there, she was trying to snatch my groceries away…I tried explaining to her that the children needed them…and sh-she said…’ I stuttered as I spoke while pointed an accusing finger at Nicky…  Everyone turned her way and stared at her accusingly and disgusted at her…she gave me the most evil glare you could ever imagine…inside I was laughing my head off…but outside I had to play it cool in order to get maximum satisfaction…this was way too fun…  ‘She said…that…homeless children were….were….USELESS AND UNLOVED AND THEY DESERVED TO DIE!!!!!!’ I blurted out while tears trickled down my cheek…  I bawled my eyes out while the lady gave me a comforting hug…  I didn’t have to look but I could tell that everyone was glaring at Nicky like she was the most disgusting and fowl thing that ever roamed the planet…*sigh*…my plan was working perfectly…now all I had to do was finish it off…  ‘Well…*sniffle*…I don’t want to bother you…good, GOOD people but I must be going now…I can’t keep the children waiting…they need me, but I have NO IDEA how I’m going to explain that they will have no dinner tonight…or supper…or breakfast the next day…’ I said giving a sympathetic look to all the by-standers…  They gave me sympathetic, pitiful looks with little whines of sorrow…  One by one I slowly picked up the soiled vegetables from the ground while placing them in the paper bag glumly…  ‘Wait! I think I’ve got some money I can help you with!’ the lady said trying to help.  ‘No…I can’t take that…it wouldn’t be right.’ I refused.  ‘Yes it would...I want to help the children too!’ the woman reassured me…  ‘well…if it’s for the children….thank you…your help is kindly appreciated…wait till they hear the news…such an angel has come down to help them..’ I said with gratitude and relief in my voice…  I took her money and held it in my hand as if it was gold…soon after all the other people came up to me and said a few kind words as well as handing me money to by groceries for the ‘homeless’ children…*sigh*…  As they walked past me…they shot Nicky evil glares and gave her rude comments…  ‘Shame on you!’ one would say.  ‘You’re the one who doesn’t deserve to live!’ someone would spit at her..  ‘You need help!’ another would retort  Nicky opened her mouth to speak as her eyes bulged in fury and wonderment…in the end she sighed and crossed her arms in defeat…  NOW who got the last laugh…I secretly smirked to myself knowing I had the upper hand now…not to mention piles of money in my pocket…  When we finally got home Nicky couldn’t stop shooting me evil glares….  ‘What? Don’t you care about the homeless children?’ I asked her innocently while taunting and teasing her…  ‘Cheap bastard’ she mumbled…  ‘Say that to my face young lady!’ I dared her.  ‘Cheap threat!’ she yelled out before stomping off in one of her fits again…  Today was actually quite fun…although I paid P1,537…it was sure worth it…I managed to earn P9,895 as well as humiliating Nicky in front of a whole crowd…*sigh*…I was just too good…  *****************TO BE CONTINUED****************
