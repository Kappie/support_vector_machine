In celebration for Fathers day, my family is going out to our cottage by a glorified pond referred to as Gerry Lake.  We're going to have pizza, soda, (Mountain Dew rocks!) and then go swimming.  Or maybe swim first then eat after.  Don’t know, don't care.  Boy, I was up to about 12 AM last night playing Max Payne.  Cool game, really.  Expect a review when I beat it.  Probably not going to play it tonight, cause I need to get some sleep.  My school is having an "end-of-the-year" trip and I gotta be at the school (1/2 hour away) by 6:00.  So.... no late night.  As I'm typing right now, I also happen to be trying to download Magic the Gathering Online so I can play it.  I like CCGs (Collectable Card Games, in case you didn't know,) and online games are cool.  Except for lag.  When you're out in the boondocks and you can only get a 56k connection that runs at about 28k on a good day, you get lag.  A card game shouldn't have too much lag... I hope.  Just finished the book "Artimis Fowl" yesterday as well.  I'm a very speedy reader, so I read quite a lot.  And it's fun too!  The book was cool, well, let me see.  In writing style, the book wasn't that great.  Too many... uh, what do you call them?  Oh yeah, sentence fragments.  Little more like a children’s book, hang on a sec... oh yeah, it  is  a children’s book.  Oops.  Well, plotwise, the characters weren’t well developed, but the overall storyline was well though out.  However, I still liked the characters.  Artimis is just a cool kid, Holly is a cool (though egotistical) fairy, and Butler is, is, Butler.  What really made me like this book was the concept of the world and devices.  I can't really go into detail about that, because my mom (whop is unaware of my blog) wants me to get off the net so she can call her father who is in Texas.  So... gotta get off.  Write later.
