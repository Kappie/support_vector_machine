It has the guitar tabs for 30 of Van Halen's songs, including "Panama." Now, I just have to wait until Monday to be shipped the book and I can learn the entire song, plus several other ones. The book was only $17, which is a good buy if you ask me.      And, through some divine intervention, Murray is alive again...well...it was for a little while at least. We just started it up tonight, like it was nothing. It still has it's problems, but at least it ran long enough so that we could mow the grass. The strange thing is that Murray died again RIGHT after we finished. I mean, at the entrance to the building we store it in. Weird. Just more proof that there is a God, I suppose.      That is all for now. Catch you later.
