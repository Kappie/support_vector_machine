But that's okay, because I'm not doing it for people to read. I don't know what I'm doing this for, to be honest. Well, it gives me a place to post my thoughts anyway.  I'm sitting in the Wilkinson Center on BYU campus right now. Wireless internet is great. I'm listening to Counting Crows. I just got off work a little over an hour ago and came over here to get a bite to eat before heading over to the bus stop to go home. Teryaki Stix. Curry Bowl. It's about the cheapest thing that you can get that will actually fill you up. It's weird though. I usually eat as much as I can and then I get this funky stomach ache. Don't know what that's all about.  Anyway, I'm going to head home now and try to get some work done. I need to study for my history class. I need to study for the MCAT. I need to work on applications to medical schools. I need to run four miles. So much to do, so little time. So again I ask myself, why am I sitting here doing a blog? Who knows...
