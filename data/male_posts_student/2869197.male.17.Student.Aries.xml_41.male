Good discussion which quickly turned to vegitarianism. A couple turned out to be vegitarians, some turned into vegitarians. I always knew Mr. Green was a veggie, but it surprised me to find a good percentage of our club to be as well. Veganism and vegitarianism is okay with me. I fully realize you people have reasons for such insanity, much like I have reasons for mine. But I'm currently an unconverable carnivore. I love burger, steak, poultry, and many other delicacies of the meaty variety. I've been brought up by a farmer's daughter and another farmer's son. My Tunta (aunt) Yupka gave us a big slab of meat from her dairy farm a while ago and my siblings and I giggled with glee. I don't fear meat's health risks much like I don't fear saliva, dirt, or expiration dates. I've decided that if I fear these things, I must fear all high sources of germs, and live a bubbled-enclosed existance. I can't do that. Besides, it is fun to watch people squirm as I digest the baser things of life. The only reason I would turn veggie would be for the price. I hear that veggitarian lifestyles are, in fact, cheaper than omnivorous ones. That deeply touches my inner Dutchman. Perhaps one day I will test this theory.  More recent news, I decided to re-read some of my Terry Pratchett books  Discworld  . IMO, these books are perhaps the funniest books on my shelves, equaled only by Douglas Adams with his  Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy . I'm a newly made fan of British satire as of last summer, and love it in book and movie form (Oh sweet sweet Monty Python and your Holy Grail!). If your interest is piqued, consider buying  The Color of Magic  by TP. I know it sounds a little gay, but it's worth every penny.
