Which is good (especially for college, which is a big reason why I do any NNHS stuff), 'cept that I can't really understand what real French people are saying when they talk fast.  I get "Attack of the Clones" when I play it in French, but that's only because I pretty much know what they're saying already and they slow it down to correspond to the English-speaking mouths.  Oh well, whadayagannado (is that annoying?  It looks like it would be)?  Other peeps going include Yan (you know, from French last year) and Maddy Abromowitz.  I think it'll be kind of easy, since I'll only be doing NNHS work while I'm there, but we'll see how it affects my grade.  It certainly couldn't hurt my college resume that much.  Loren has such a stupid blog.  He keeps putting ellipses (dot dot dots) instead of periods, which would be alright except a) he doesn't talk like that, and b) it's really annoying when it keeps going for multiple paragraphs.  Just picture someone talking like that, and it'll tick you off before five seconds.  And another thing, have you read his "plan" to save money by not buying lunch, though with admitted spending sprees.  Food is the most important thing you can buy with money; you shouldn't starve yourself for a hat or something.  He also buys clothes... shouldn't his parents do that?  Ending (I don't want to ramble on too long), here are some long-awaited quotes, both said in history:  "Whereas if you go around murdering people just because you're a murderer..." (and I was like, well that's a good reason) ---Ms. Heidlage  -How do you know she was doing it for women's suffrage? -Oh, she died, she died! -But how do you know she did it for women's suffrage? -Oh, it was real, it really happened! -But how do you know she did it for women's suffrage? -Oh, she did, she did. ---Jessica Li questioning Ms. Heidlage (apparently a little miscommunication)
