I guess, that could be considered an advantage of living so far from school, I really get mad time to think.    So I was thinking about sex.  Yes, Marcus isn't completely asexual, so I'm allowed to think about sex.  It's a natural addiction that people have, I guess more of a mental addiction then a physical addiction.  The only problem with it, is that unlike food, which we are born desireing and probubly desire until we die, sex is a desire that comes later, and more unexpected.  Most people can't comprehend it well, because it's not something we're born with and it scares them.  That's why religions are controlling about it.  That's why people are scared to mention it, but really, the desire to have sex is no worse then eating it's just a natural process.  The thing that really makes it bad though, is that's it's largely reflexive.  St.  Augustine, I believe, said that before Adam ate from the tree of knowledge, he had full controll over ALL his appendages.  Which brings up yet another point, but now I'm just ramballing.
