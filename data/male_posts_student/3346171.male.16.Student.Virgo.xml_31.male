I'll go to the movies today, to watch "the day after tomorrow", me and my friend Lorraynne, and tomorrow morning i'll play volleyball with the volleyball friends. Wierd i separate my friends by the thing i hang time out with them. Like: the are the friends from class, the friends from school, the friends from the english course, the friends from Volley, and the internet ones, which are separated in portuguese, american and others. I'm mean. Anyway, they're all friends. :)  Ahhhhhhh, and the friends from the gym... oops, i don't have friends there.
