After the show in Cochrane, Robyn's, and tonight. I don't feel sick most of the time, but then all of a sudden, it hits me. I think it's my neck, I really think it's my neck. Who needs money? I'll give somebody 15 buck to give me an hour massage. As long as you're good, yo. Any takers, comment.  I sold my first Christmas present of the season today. A depressing reminder that Christmas is upon us, and in just over two months, many people will be broke. I, being one of the lucky retail workers, will have their money. Until January. When I will be flat broke. But really, I like Christmas.  Why though, does everyone celebrate Christmas? I understand the religious foundations for the holiday, which makes me wonder why many people do celebrate it. It's become so much more than just a religious thing, I think. It's a time for people to rush. All of November and all of December, people rush around, filling their carts. It all builds up to one climactic day (Christmas Eve), and then they can rest. And it's the best kind of rest. Chilling with family, calling up friends. Yes. Aside from the religious point, we as a society need Christmas. It keeps us sane (as insane as it makes us).  anyway.
