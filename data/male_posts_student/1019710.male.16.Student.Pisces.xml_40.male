They say that Pat Tillman was not a hero, just an idiot. I don't care if your a democrat or a republican you should support your country and those who die for you to live in it. Pat Tillman gave up a job which made him millions so that he could fight for the freedom of you and me. So to the author of that article i have just this to say to you.... Get a life you waste of space.    urlLink SI.com - NFL - UMass president criticizes student's column on felled soldier - Thursday April 29, 2004 2:13PM
