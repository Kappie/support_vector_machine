I had some pretty freaky dreams last night. I can't even remember them any more, but they were very odd. I woke up at about 8 or so. I think that Chris woke me up, he wasn't really happy in the morning. Took a shower, all the essentials, than I walked down to church. I guess my walking to the church is kind of a time to wake up in the mornings (and I suppose the glass of Mountain Dew didn't help), because when I got to church, I was a bit on the hyper side.   Let's see, I got into Sunday school. We were going through Proverbs today. I just noticed, I would probably like that book.  Wow, three sentence paragraph. After church we went out to lunch. It was one of my friends birthdays and we went to Chevy's to celebrate. I didn't eat anything, except their chips. I like their chips because they make them hot, and it tastes great. All they need to do is put salt on it by default. It would be so much more convienent. We talked a bit and then the whole gang, Nick, Sam, Dominique, Carlos and I all went to Lake Del Valle. Our church went there for a picnic and it was lots of fun. I am now a human towel, apparently. A little girl that we were watching while they were swimming forgot her towel. So I let her ride on my back while we walked up to the site. My back was all wet from that, but the little girl said it would be refreshing, and I have to admit, she was right.  Towards the end of the time being there, Dominique and I were talking to my dad. My dad asked her when she was coming over next, and she told him next Sunday. My dad had no problem with that. I couldn't believe it. It would have taken me much longer to convince my dad. So now I get to be with Dominique the day before our 1 year anniversary.   Anyways, I am pretty much done now. I don't think I can think of anything else to say. I might get distracted and leave in mid-sentence. I think I will go call...
