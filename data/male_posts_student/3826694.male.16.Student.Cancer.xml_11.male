Getting "OWNED" is quite self explanatory. "OWNAGE" is when sh!t happens, and you just have to take it and move on... Some things here are just funny, and some are just horrible.  For example...     Here, as you can see, Justin Timberlake has just been "OWNED".  As you enjoy my page, please... try to minimize your own "OWNAGE" in your daily life... I'll make posts both in pictures and in detailed accounts. Tell me about your own accounts of "OWNAGE" and you might get it posted. Have fun...  (I might add pictures that I didn't come up with, but you can still give me credit... I'm showing them to you)
