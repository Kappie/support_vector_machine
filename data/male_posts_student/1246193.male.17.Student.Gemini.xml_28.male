It was probably one of the best campouts I have ever been on.  I met a lot of new, fun people.  Our scoutmaster wasn't a complete jerk.  We played capture the flag at 10:30 in total darkness.  I am really looking forward to the high-adventure trip this summer.  We are going to Florida and although we have made our own itinerary, I think it will be better than going to SeaBase, and a lot less expensive.  I think this is going to be a pretty good week.  I was dreading the English project but now that we have started it,  I am having fun.  We watched Shrek in Spanish.  Orchestra is also gearing up for a trip to Chicago.  I hope that I will be able to go. Three weeks until my birthday.  I am looking forward to summer.  It should be fun.  I am in a really good mood.  I just need to give a special thanks to Autumn and Bethany for their little "note"book.  I will talk to some of you tomorrow.  I won't talk to others.  Ciao.
