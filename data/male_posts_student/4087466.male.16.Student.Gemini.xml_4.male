We went to an orphanage. The kids were cute, makulit, playful and most of all, they  DROOL !!!! It was a Unilab thing (my parents work there). I carried some of them (actually, all of them). And of course, all of them drooled on me. I had to change my shirt after that. We then had lunch in Max's. At least wala nang drooling doon!!!   Do I look good with a kid?
