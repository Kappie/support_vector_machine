Comments are welcome and encouraged on all entries, especially if you can constructively criticise them.   urlLink     This photo was an experimental shot for me. My grandma has a bookcase containing an entire encyclopedia at the top of a very dark flight of stairs. I noticed them for their uniformity, and started shooting them. Since it was so dark, I was leaving the shutter open for 5 seconds per shot. I was inspired by a Jim Brandenburg photo, and decided to pull the book out slightly, open the shutter and stick my hand into the frame halfway through, being careful not to move the book (which was rather precariously positioned) and trying to control the shaking of my hand (curse you, caffeine!) to produce a sharp shot. I love how it turned out.
