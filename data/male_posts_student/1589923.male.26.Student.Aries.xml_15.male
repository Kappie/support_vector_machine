Is this the beginning of Cold War 2? a standoff between 2 individuals who are living in existance yet denying each other's personal presence. It's so surreal. It's like the tip of the iceberg. u do not know what lies beneath. I am not perfect and i am guilty of my own flaws which i myself wish i never had. somehow i wonder if the problem is with me or am i looking at a reflection of myself thru others? it's a queer feeling that i am feeling. a twitching uneasiness that does not go away.
