I mean I know my friends will always be there for me no matter what its just that with my "old flame" we were always able to talk and joke around. I need that again. I need them to know that no matter what I'm there for them. I'm not the lying Bitch mine was. The fact is I want someone real bad but.......I know I need to tell her but I think the fact is....... I think she wants to get with my best friend and that would make me so happy to see but in my heart........ She is the perfect girl and if I cant get with her I need someone in my life that is just like her.
