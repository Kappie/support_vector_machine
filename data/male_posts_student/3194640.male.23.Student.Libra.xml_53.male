The first thing I did this morning was purchase tickets to the concert for next weekend. When I went to break, I got a voicemail from my wife this morning saying that I got shorted on my paycheck. I didn't think she was right. To my dismay, she was right and it was my fault. When I had filled out my time sheet last week, I overlooked one day on my time card. In other words, I did not get paid for one day. My supervisor didn't catch my mistake either. It was all my fault, so I was pretty ticked at myself. I'll get paid for it, but I'm not sure when. The day is looking up, though.
