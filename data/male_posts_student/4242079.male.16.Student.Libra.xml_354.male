Well, okay, *I* don't know most of you. So yeah. If anyone can come up with a short, humorous, to-the-point questionaire for all of us to post, please, er, do so. Yes, I'm too lazy to do it myself. I suck at writing surveys, but I happen to know that someone else on this blog has a rather nice talent for it... ::coughhannahcoughcough::
