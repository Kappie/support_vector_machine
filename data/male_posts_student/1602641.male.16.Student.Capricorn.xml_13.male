Mr. Novak claims that he was given this information by White House officials. THIS IS COMPLETELY ILLEGAL. He also refuses to name his sources - EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE FEDERAL OFFICE HOLDERS WHO HAVE COMMITTED FEDERAL CRIMES- and dismisses criticism of the administration’s actions as plain ol’ ‘Bush-bashing’. Now is this a right wing junta or what?   (Personal note: I’m very excited at the possibility that Karl Rove could potentially go to prison! And not just some cushy, minimum-security country club prison - whupass, rock-breakin’, federal prison. That would be terrific.)
