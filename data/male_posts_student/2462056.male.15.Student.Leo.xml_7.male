It is called I, Robot by Isaac Asimov.  Big Willy Smith is going to be in the movie of it, which comes out next Friday I think.  Wonder if it will be any good.  Tonight was the grand opening of the Auburn Hooters, so I went with a group of people (Claire, Dabney, Andy, Ben, Jordan, Chrissy, Max, Jen, Zach, Ashley, Conor, Phillip).  It took us like, an hour and a half to get a seat, and then when we finally got in there... the food kinda sucked and the waitresses weren't that good looking, so it wasn't worth the wait.  But it was still a lot of fun because of all my friends being there and us getting to hang out and stuff.  We got Claire and Dabney to fake that it was their birthday's so the people did a little birthday thing for them at the place, and it was cool, haha.  Then afterwards, we went to Conor's house and hung out, played darts, watched TV, played pool.  It was fun stuff, then I left there around 11:30 and came home, got on the computer, drank some lemonade, read my book, and then decided to update my journal, which I am doing right now! What a coincidence... Man, we are out of orange soda, which pisses me off, because I really want some orange soda right now....
