Not a REAL cold shower, because I was jumping around the whole time, and was only in the shower for about a minute, washing myself and hair the fastest I ever have; but a cold shower nevertheless. I got out as soon as I could, and was shivering  from head to toe.  Now I feel toasty. I have no idea why. I just feel really warm. I'm still in a towel and bathrobe, but I usually don't feel this way after a normal shower. That, and I'm really woken up.  Cold showers rock.  Except for the whole "cold" part.
