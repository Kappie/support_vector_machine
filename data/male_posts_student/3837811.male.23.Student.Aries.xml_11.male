On my way to work, this stupid bee was bugging two ladies and after that, the damn bee came for me, yes! And it doesnt help that my company logo on my polo t looks like a flower somehow. Shit, i spent like 30secs siam-ing that damn black ting, and the two ladies were there "see show, drink coke, eat popcorn". Malu sia, and yes its black, not those normal yellow and black idiots. Total black, fierce.     Give me a break will ya?   Ok, so my colleague, Robin, was at the doc during the morning, so i need to take classes alone. For morning classes the P4s.. The first class was ok, coz the form teacher helped me out, and i apologized to her for the troubles. But the second class, the form teacher disappeared once the kids had entered the lab, and i was alone.. B4 i knew it, the form teacher complained to me that why are the kids running around? Oh, she is such a BIG help to me. Thank you very much! But soon after, my friend/colleague, Kendra, reached the lab, jus to help me with the second class while Robin is at the doc. Thank god, im saved!  Went lunching with Kendra after that and had a long talk about topics like cockroaches and bees. Lol, pests, insects, aint they cute? Robin came back in the afternoon and put me out of my misery.. Took the Em1 class today, and they scored really high, poweration.  Went home for my grandma's dinner, if u've read one of my recent postings.. U should know what i had for dinner... No prizes for correct guesses.. YES! EGGS! Egg-phobia is at level-9 now i tink.     You are so beautiful... To me...    Watched room-raiders on MtvAsia, this show is about a lady going through guys' bedroom, picked the room she liked best and go for a date with that particular guy. Oh man, if a girl came into my room, sure... *FAINTS*!     Yes, i did it again..   Ok i saw the votes for my  urlLink Underwear Poll , but there are 9votes in total, 4 for No, 3 for Yes, 2 for Maybe. I demand a recount of the votes, the difference of the votes are too close already. So carry on voting!
