Was like I set alarm of 9 am but then hor it wasnt until 11 then Lishen and Patrick called to my house and wake me up... :P Rush all the way to Lishen's house and then play for a while before going to buy birthday cake for Daniel.   Quite fun lorhz. Hope he like the present we gave him. Sort of a cuddly soft toy.  Then me and Darius never went to East Coast. Too late mahz. He need to book in tonight mahz. So went Bugis. Spent 15 bucks on the food. What the hell. Food quite nice. I love bacon worz...  Though we meet up for only 2 hours or so, it was really great.   Maybe... I will... You know...  Night.   Ooppss. Not yet. im not gonna sleep so soon. :P
