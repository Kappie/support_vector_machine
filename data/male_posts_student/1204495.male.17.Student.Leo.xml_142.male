It means the teachers are hardly ever in the lessons, which is good, and i don't have to be in college until 12.10 tomorrow :D:D so that means an extra long sleep in :D:D God bless economics! because of the interviews, no need to go to any economics lessons until a week today, next tuesday :D also means i get friday afetrnoon off :D:D
