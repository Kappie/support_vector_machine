However i reckon i could solve both problems by finding a particularly talented crocodile or alligator, making it release a record and then forcing it to play every night in gloucestershire whilst staying in my bedroom.  and i could charge it all the rent i wanted as it would be a crocodile and thus have no concept of ownership and currency.  Then when i didnt want it i could sell it to las vegas where it would be made to perform nightly, get very fat and die at a relatively young age in an embarrasing way.  have been watching a few MST3K dvds.  Discovered Manos: The Hands Of Fate which i think is one of the funniest things i have every seen.  If you dont know what MST3K is then you should find out, and buy some dvds from america because of the good exchange rate.    Dont patronise Torgo
