Rick Santorum on Friday, praising his job performance and pronouncing him "an inclusive man" despite comments he made equating homosexuality to bigamy, polygamy, incest and adultery."   An "inclusive" man?  Anyone wanna tell me what the fuck that means?  That's right, it's Republican double-speak for "Far-Right Wing Agenda-Advancing Homophobe".  He's  inclusive .  He's got enough hatred and bigotry for  everyone .  These are the people who are writing our laws, people.  Vote early and vote often.
