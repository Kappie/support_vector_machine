I completely hate all the teachers except Ms. Lazarus and unfortunetly I have some tests tomorrow, Tuesday and Thursday. Ok so what happened on Friday you ask...Matt, Paul and I went to Jill's house because Shapiro was there along with another hot girl that was in my Italian class in the beginning of the year. Then Shapiro, Matt and I went into town and Paul had to go to his sister's dance recital to hump pillows. We flew to Subway's and then when we went to Cornet, Shapiro went bye bye. We saw Laura C, Stephanie G and Annabel W there. Matt joined in on their little guitar pow wow. It was funny because Matt was picking up all these expensive guitars and the guy probably wanted to knock his head off. Me on the other hand took a different approach... THE BONGOS. Then Matt and I left to Incredible Ices and I got a strawberry. By the way, Matt got good at guitar... playing Stairway To Heaven, well it isn't the hardest song to play. It is mine and my father's favorite Led Zep song though. Sounds sort of like a mid evil enchanted story book song in the beginning. Then Matt and I went to my house, Paul couldn't sleep over because he failed Math and was punished all Summer. He told the news to us on the phone, but I wasn't a bit surprised... "Is that kid smoking pot?" - My Papa. Ok, so he comes over SAYING FOOLED YOU!!! That was a relief. Then Dan came over to play some guitar and then when we showed him Jesus on the computer screen, he started freaking out slapping himself trying to get Jesus out of his head. Then we played Ding Dong Ditch and I rang the Mofia's house!!! Holy shit, me and Dan were pissin our pants running. The guy came out cursing in Italian while we tried to catch up with the two pussies, Paul and Matt, who were afraid to ring any house. Especially Matt... his excuse was there was no where to hide but when we brought him to a house with a million hiding spots, he hid from us! Ok, so yesterday... Paul, Matt and I biked to Country Kitchen, me and Matt took the 111 route and beat Paul! He took the Main St. route (actually back alley of the stores). Paul and Matt were being babies and they spilt their orange juice. Jared's sister served us. And... that's basically it for the rest of the day. Except we went to the big 97.5 WALK bear on Main St. and took a million stickers and sponsored the station by putting the stickers on a million people. I gave one to this lady in a car, and she freaked out thinking I wanted to rape her. We also saw Steve F. Ok, so Matt and Paul had to go, I ran around the neighborhood and saw Louis Amato and Ryan G... and Cody C (not with Ryan and Louis)... actually it should be Louis and Ryan, alphabetically OH GOD I HATE THIS OCD!!! Then I watched the lightening. I babysat my sister at night while watching Peter Pan for Crystal. Then I watched Ice Age and passed out. Today, I gave my dad an awesome Father's Day Card and I'm gonna see my cousins!
