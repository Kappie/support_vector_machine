And with we awake from our indoor winter hibernations and explore the new world changing before our eyes as each each day of spring passes. The worst thing to be doing at a time like this is schoolwork. You can't help but get lost in the spring day awating you as you look out the window. Fortunantely as I was doing this today as my mind drifting for a breif second from the chemistry test lying on my desk, I realized this would be mine to enjoy uniterupted for the next 9 days. That is the joy of spring break. Bright sunny days are revealing themselves to us and we get to enjoy the first few of them without school or homework. Thats why I have decided Spring Break is one of the best ideas ever. Whoever first thought, "We should let students enjoy the arrival of spring instead of forcing them to learn while they long to be outside." It gives us that thread of hope that summer will actually come...eventually.   The simple joy of riding down the road with the windows rolled down and a steady breeze swirling through the car returned to me this past week also. It something you don't realize you miss until spring rolls around and your able to do it again. Once the windows are down and your cruising down the interstate, its time to crank up the volume and enjoy the music. This feeling gives you the oppurtunity to anticipate sprawling out by the pool and soaking in some rays as the music floats away through the summer sky. Oh how nice it will be to hop in the pool for the first time this summer.  But now it is time to enjoy spring break. As of now, no plans are set in stone except for sleeping in and being lazy most hours of the day. Hopefully, the weather will cooperate and we can add plenty of outdoor activities to the schedule. But one rainy day is never that bad. A trip to the movies always fits well into the schedule for a rainy day. And I won't have to worry about mom getting on my case about anything ( nah just kidding..Have fun on your adventure!) And yes, mom, the party has already been planned. Haha.   And a time to every purpose, under Heaven: A time to be born, A time to Die. But in spring, there is only a time to be born. And spring break will breath new life into all of us...atleast enough to get us through the rest of trhe school year 'til summer. Until then, enjoy spring.  Watch the Lamb. Spring brings new lambs, too. So be glad about that.  EDIT*: I jsut went to read Greg's blog from a few days ago and noticed they were very similar and that was the first time I had read it. Thats crazy. If two people write the same thing are undoubtedly correct about this subject and everything else we say.
