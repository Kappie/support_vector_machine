One person has played from midnight and beyond for 3 days. 3 days! I then go on to read about even more people who say they would spend all their time in exactly the same way, and that they love using the Forums, etc., etc.  Omigod!  That is so sad. I don't want to be like that. I want to go out and have fun. I want to read and watch movies and listen to and create music and draw, all with artistic thoughts running through my head. I want to finish TOE, I want to play in a band, I want to experience a wide and rich variety of forms and styles of entertainment. I want to swim and play some kind of sport regularly.  Gawd, now I'm all depressed about how my life is panning out. The summer holidays suck. Owww, my belly hurts. X-(
