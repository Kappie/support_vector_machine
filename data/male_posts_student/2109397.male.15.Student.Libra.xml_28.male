But it was really funny because all the commentators were like crtiquing the slam dunk contest and analyzing it. I was like comeon get a life. They were like their strategy should be to "dunk and advance" I was like they arent trying to win the god damn thing theyre just trying to have fun so shut up. They were like he needs to nail this to win and all this shit, he shouldnt be trying something hes never done before, he shouldnt just run up and jup and then decide, blah blah blah what low life losers.
