I look forward to that day greatly, and I miss you so very much. Make the most of your days there, please do. Enjoy everything you can, as hard as that may be. I want nothing more than for you to be happy. I love you much, and it hurts when I know you are in pain. Today was a bit more productive, well at least more relaxing. I slept in a good bit, almost till 11, which is a freaking record for me, as you know. Then I had to do more yardwork, yay dad being gay. Then I got all clean from taht and did work on the computer scanning in more picatures and whatnot. Then I took some me time, almost finishing off my room. I also doodled and drew for a bit. I drew us, but it didn't come out incredibly well. Then again nothing but the real thing does your beauty any justice. You are a gift to whomever eyes may gaze upon you. I got to talk to you too, which rocked, although I am sorry once more for the bill. I will help pay it, if I ever get in the positive with my money once more. Then the diana bitching came, and it went well, but I need to ask you a favour. You can't kill her, you can't bitch at her, and you pretty much can't talk to her, ever or at all. I promise if that happens though, you will probably never hear from her again. I cut off everything today, deleting her from my buddylists and phone, and getting rid of the last of diana things. except for what other people say about her, she is gone. That is how the convo ended, and hopefully she will be leaving other people alone as well, as long as they leave her alone too, which is why I ask it of you to please not go to her and do anything. if you want to talk to me aboot her, i will gladly do that, just keep things quiet with her. hopefully this is all for the best. now if you read this again tonite, get some rest and dream sweet dreams. I am yours to come home to, no one else gets me. I love you greatly, and am in no way leaving you. Remember that when you sleep *mwah* I know I do :)  Beneroo
