It's some kind of cold or something. Which is weird because it's not the least bit cold outside. But anyways, about the Market. Today was my second day on the job, as I do it every Wednesday. Like last time, I help set up my dad's plant's, sold stuff, talked to the crazy city people, and packed up. Then we went to Gritty's (that bar that my dad goes to), and my sister met us there (because she wanted to). Sooo my sister and I walked around. I went to that comic store I was looking for last week with little thanks to the directions I got from MapQuest (COMPLETELY WRONG). It was pretty damn pwnful. Wall-to-wall comics, it's a comic nerd's dream. :) Much better than the one in Saco that NEVER SEEMS TO HAVE WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR. Jerks. So then my sister dragged me to some jewelry store. But redeemed herself by buying me ice cream! Yay! Once again, I'm damned exhausted (and sick), but I'mma stay up and read those comics I bought. Whee! *collapses*
