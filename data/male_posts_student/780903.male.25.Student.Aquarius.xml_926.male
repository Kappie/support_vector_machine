In my mock draft last night when I should have been sleeping, I probably grabbed Ryan Klesko and Junior Spivey a couple rounds too early, and missed out on 2004's NL MVP Mike Cameron, but other than that I think I did ok.  :)  Incidentally, if anyone's got a fantasy league with an opening, let me know.  I'm already in a couple, but I'm kind of obsessed, so I'd love to maybe add a couple more...
