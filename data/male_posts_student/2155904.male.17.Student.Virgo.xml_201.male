Tyke had a haircut scheduled for 11AM but he managed to turn off his alarm in a state of half-sleep and doesn't remember doing so but nonetheless he woke up after 11.  He heard the phone ring and realized it was late.  He managed to get it rescheduled for later in the day though.  Tyke then used his time in between to play some MVP Baseball which is a tight game.  And then he finally left, in his brother's car, for his haircut.  He got back and at 3 Amed, Dr. Phil, and K-Caj came over to film the English final.  What they did is take the Talking Sex show and make it into a talk show with guests coming on the show.  They used Oedipus, Stephen from Portrait of an Artist, Mersault from The Stranger, Ivan Ilych, and Hamlet.  Tyke played Ivan and Hamlet.  Oedipus was played by K-Caj and this was the only one that took more than one take to complete decently.  He kept messing up and didn't have his part down but finally they got something adequate enough to finish.  The rest was pretty good but it isn't all that funny or exemplary.  Just good enough.  After that they went to Teriyaki Bistro for dinner.  Then they came back up and played a few games of Shithead followed up by the game of global domination, or Risk.  Although K-Caj really had no idea how to play, he won.  And Amed got very angered and tried to stop the advice of Tyke and Dr. Phil but in the end it was not enough.  Dr. Phil was spread so thin that he couldn't really do anything and Tyke made a blunder in trying to take over Africa and South America at the same time rather than just control Asia like he actually could have.  But in the end K-caj's army was just too much.  The most retarded move he made was to stop his army from taking over the entire world because he didn't think he could although he had like 13 armies left and all he needed was Australia.  So he stopped and waited a turn to get even more build-up and Dr. Phil (who stockpiled armies in Japan only for like 5 turns) managed to outlast Tyke and die last.  But Tyke had the second most dominant force in the game behind K-caj.  In the end, he was obliterated from the earth and it meant nothing.  After this they played Taboo.  Tyke's team won every time but when he was with K-caj who was a newbie to the game and improved every turn but still isn't the best.  He is hilarious to watch give clues because he gets so nervous and loud and flustered when he does it.  But Tyke is still the best.  Ahh yes, it's great being the best.  And now Tyke's night is over at 10PM.  So he will go grab some food and then probably just play MVP before heading off to bed.  It was a good, productive day.  And tomorrow isn't even the last day of the weekend so this is looking good.  Maybe some bball will arise tomorrow.  Let's just see what happens.
