He purchased a beautiful new bicycle and then made Ryan, the Walmart associate, really earn his money by discussing the 674 different configurations of a bike lock:   1. around the front tire and through the frame 2. around the back tire and through the frame 3. two times around the middle and through the front tire 4. around the river and through the woods, to grandmother's house he goes 5. around my neck six times and shoved in my eye 6-674. so on and so forth  Luke and I capped off the evening by sticking the cat in the refrigerator and playing a round of  Skip Bo!  Luke kicked my skip-bo-loving ass. Oh, yes. Mr. Fischer - cat lover - failed to notice that his new daughter, CindyVacaCat, took residence in the refrigerator when he had opened the door. Close, went the door and achoo, went the cat. I found her a few minutes later when I went looking for the jelly. I don't think that's what they mean by "Fresh Kitty."  I have a date for Thursday with Mr. Bilcultural Trilingual Med Student Piece of Meat. And so it begins....my summer dating routine. It's funny how I would trade a score a nice guys for just one asshole. The same way I would trade a thousand small towns for just one big city. Marc did everything right. Called before Wednesday for a weekend date. He is great. My mind, however, is always on someone else.  Lukey Luke Luke lent me his laptop to download songs for my the mp3 player ChrisSinclair gave me. I love the men in my life and their gadgets.  I met Christopher Michael Sinclair working at the Wendy's. I thought he was absolutely gorgeous and completely out of my league. (He is perfectly symmetrical.) Nine months later, we started dating and he became my significant other. It was the first time I had a boyfriend who was prettier than I was. Early in our relationship we stopped getting along and I sent him out of my room and out of my life. I vowed never to remain friends with any of my ex-boyfriends because keeping ex's around is always a bad idea. Congratulations Sinclair, you are the first exception to a very old rule.  I could never tell him that the reason our relationship didn't work is that my mind and my heart resided in a different place, a different house, a different relationship with a different person. Although he had no obligation to me, he would come to me and comfort me while my life was falling apart. We get along so much better now that we're not together. We talk on the phone every night. He's in Texas and I wish I were there. I miss you, Sinclair.   urlLink    Damn Sinclair - Damn Pretty urlLink
