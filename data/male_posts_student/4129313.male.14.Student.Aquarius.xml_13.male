Well, heres how my day went. First period wasn't much interesting, nothin realy happened. It's one of my most boring classes.  I read my book (  Gathering Blue)   althrough second period again. I love reading, I just don't have time to read all day. Oh, how I wish the earth can rotate just slightly slower so that the day is longer, and I can have a few extra hours to read every day.  Third period we had a sub, and a test, I'm sure I aced it. It was only review stuff I did once already before It's a real shame they screwed up so badly when I was a seventh grader, I could have been in Algebra 2 by now. It's a long story, basicly I was so smart in my 6th grade math class, the teacher decided to recomend I go strait into Algebra 1A, so I got into 7th grade, and was put into Algebra 1A. I was doing pretty good, and then I had to move down to Apple Valley. I got into a new school, and was put into PRE ALGEBRA, because thats what they assumed tipical 7th graders needed. So I complained about it, and they wouldn't let me into Algebra 1A. So 8th grade came, I had to do 1A again. I complained some more, and since I wasn't bumped up last year, they made me do it all over again. So now I'm in highschool, and I finaly got into 1B, and everything's a review, AND I could be in Algebra 2 by now.  Fourth period I had to recite the second stanza of that poem, and since I had a test in 3rd period, I accidently forgot to repeat it all day. I got half way through and screwed up badly. She also had us move around and while she was outside waiting, just so she could list our names in order of where we were sitting. She missed one of them, but she got the rest right. I could have realy used that 15 extra credit points for later on. One student tryed to cheat and say she got his name wrong. He lost 50 out of the 78 points he had left.  Fifth period was alot cooler than the rest of the weak, but we still went into the gym to play BBall. We had to run 2 laps before we did that though. I realy should have done PE last summer.  Sixth period I had a german test. Got an A-. It would be better, but I mixed up the question words (who what where when why (wer was wo wenn warum))  My tire was flat once again, so I went upto the 7/11, filled it up, went to the Jack in the box, filled up my water bottle, and headed home. I saw some lightning near the mountains. I realy wish I didn't live in the desert, I love rain. I wish I could read in the rain, but I don't want to fuck up my book.
