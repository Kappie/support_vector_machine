I am Scaleskin, an English college student studying in southampton, hopeing to gain some good grades in both Chemistry and Computing. I also have projects outside of College...a website simply to learn a few things about webpage development, and Art...since the start of this year I have been drawing, mainly dragons, but a few anthropomorphics as well. I have interests in fantasy artwork, science and computers, and spend probably a bit too much time on the internet at times.   Anyway...onto recent events.   I have been feeling good recently, the exams are over and I only screwed up the physics exams...whoever decided all three physics exams shoudl be in the same afternoon should be eaten by hideous creatures. I am now beginning A2 courses in Chemistry and Computing...chemistry is quite interesting as this project involves an analysis on White Wine Vinegar...titrations, steam distillations etc. I should be recieving my passport in the next couple of days, my Birth certificate has ben returned now so I can expect it very soon. Nothing is gonna stand in my way of getting on board the Excelsior in july, 22nd of july to the 1st of August out in the ocean away from civilisation, finally something I can enjoy...working aboard a tall ship for a week. I am working on my art, and need to get the watercolours out to work on my hybrid picture....and then begin the next drawing...I love drawing!  I now have a profile working with a pic...after a few problems with my AOL webspace (AOL AGAIN!! lol) Thats all I can think of saying at this moment though, hopefully I will post here more often than I did on AOL.
