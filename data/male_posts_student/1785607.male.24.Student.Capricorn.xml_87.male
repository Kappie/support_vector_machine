And just around me, everything changes. It may be natural, but it's not a comforting feeling. As I've said before:  "I'm a person of habit"  ...  Friends's over. Frasier's over. Liam's over. Relationships, feelings, memories, scents, lifestyles, everything evolves, everything ... changes. Everything but me.
