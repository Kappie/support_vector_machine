The Greeks let in the Trojan horse and boom, the Trojans get themselves smashed. Well in a way this is a literary dream come true, I mean, the bloody underdogs played a great move and they deserved to win.  The legendary Trojans went on defence, closing the walls and even getting the attackers to come in and defend (think Ronaldo). The Greeks knew they had to pull something off to win it, they had to risk it... As in in the legendary story the horse was suspected, and if they went ahead and burnt up the horse Greek's hopes were all gone. But the Greeks went for the risk, and they pulled off the Trojan horse trick. This is bloody scary... I mean all the similarities...  Oh well, not really my usual length of posts... But it'll do for now! Go Greece, boo the overconfident, overhyped ad overrated Portugal.
