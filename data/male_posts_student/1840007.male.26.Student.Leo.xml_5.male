Around the time of when  was considering getting KOF2002 I went around looking up stuff on my old Saturn game and i remembered there was a cheat to unlock hidden animations like the blood and Mai's amazing bouncing titties.  Click on that link up there and see who submitted the cheat ;) (it's me by the way, i never say my real name often do i?)
