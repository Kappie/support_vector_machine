After watching the footage, its little wonder why the many in the middle east don't trust the US; oh, and if the administration think that a bit of smoozing on television will help their propaganda wars, then they must be really out to lunch. It make work for Joe Block head, the US Joe Average, but believe me, all the actions have done is re-enforced the negative views already held by the vast majority of those living in the middle east.
