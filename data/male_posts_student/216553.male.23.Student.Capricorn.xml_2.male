Right now, I'm over at my friend Sirhan's place watching the basketball game while just relaxing over our round of exams on Friday.  So far, I've done quite well and I only hope that I can keep it up.  Honestly, there isn't that much to do around here.  After the initial shock of having a beautiful mountain view and a view of the ocean is over, it really gets boring.  Yes, there are quite a few extraordinary places here such as the Four Seasons Resort, but that's all there is.  There are a few local restaurants around here, but they are nothing like they are back home.  One, they are incredibly expensive!  I'm not used to spending $4USD for fries, or ~$10CDN for a hamburger and fries. Two, they are slow!!  Three, and I guess this is a subjective opinion, but the food just doesn't taste all too great.  It's certainly not McDonalds or Burger King.  What else can I say?  Well, how about my first night here.  It was honestly, one of the weirdest nights of my life.  It probably started in Miami, Florida when I tried to use a payphone and realized that all the payphones there wer nothing like they were/are in Canada.  Also, things were quite expensive!  I know it's an airport, but prices were about double the price as compared to Toronto.  That wasn't it for my price shock.  When I got to Puerto Rico, I payed $6.25USD for a personal sized pizza!!!  That was honestly the most expensive pizza I've ever eaten.  I thought that was the end of it, but nooooo, things just got even more weird.  When I arrived in St. Kitts ar about 8pm EST, boy was I in for a shock.  I was lucky to meet one of my professor's there in the airport, but the shock was just starting.  We got into a taxi (bus) and loaded quite a few suitcases onto it.  I think the cost was about $8USD.  Now, on the way to the dock was just ridiculous, and outright weird.  There is this strip of small stores, and just put this into perspective, it's a Friday night in the Caribbean, people are partying and just having a fun time on the streets.  There were some guys jumping around and dancing on cars!!    So here's comes the ferry ride to Nevis.  It's hot, and the people were just throwing all the luggage on the ferry.  Now here I am, in a weird place, and my luggage is underneath the luggage/items of the locals.  I'm freaking out that it might simply disappear when we dock at Nevis.  So then, about 20 minutes into the ride, it starts to pour.  Non-stop rain for about 5 minutes and everything gets soaked!  Then it stops.  And then it goes again, and then it stops.  So just as we're docking at Nevis, then rain really starts to pour, and everyone on the ferry starts a mad rush towards their luggage.  I'm freaking out that my stuff is about to get stolen in the rush, and with the rain, I was ready to simply see my stuff disappear in the rain.  Thankfully, no such thing happened, but it was quite an experience.  Once I had all my stuff, I got in the school van, and had my first experience of wrong sided driving as well as the crazy roads on Nevis.  Instead of having speed bumps, there are ditches!!  Also, half the roads on this island are unpaved!!  So yeah, things are weird around here.  Once I got to the dorms, it was all good.  I have a great room on the second floor and I've met some great people here over the past few weeks.  That's all for now!
