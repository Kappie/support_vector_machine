Every time anyone has tried, he has foiled them.  Until... the villain uses the "ultimate treat" (which he stole from our characters) to treat the Untreatable.  Eventually, when our characters are trying to get back on their feet, they receive a phone call from the Untreatable, who wants to meet them in secret.  The Untreatable suggests a way to get back at the villain.  When asked how he became such an expert on treats, the Untreatable offers up a story (perfect for a montage) of how, when he was young, he was a master of treats.  The movie could then show clips of him treating his classmates/teachers/neighbors/friends as a kid throughout the 60s and 70s.  Until... the treat that went to far.  A treat of his went awry (we could think of something funny), and now he has sworn off treats.  He will not participate in this revenge treat to get back at the villain, but he will suggest a means to do it.
