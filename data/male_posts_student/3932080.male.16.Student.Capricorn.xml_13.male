Lawyers in Santa Maria made the charges today, July 27th.   Last year's television documentary (which aired in February of 2003) has footage of Jackson referring to his tendency to sleep with children as "harmless" and "nonsexual." Today's accusations are rooted in that very footage, seeing as how the young boy in the above charge's contents can be seen in the documentary.   The actions that Jackson supposedly took ( imprisoning a boy and then forcing him to perform against his will ) are being likened to stories of prisoners of war, but it seems that they relate more closely to being a member of the  Jackson 5 .   The whole imprisonment episode, if actually true, also gives an entirely new definition to the term "jailbait."
