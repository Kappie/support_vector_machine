Woohoo, even though I really wanted to stay in America, I am somewhat glad to be back where if you tell a girl to move her fanny you'd get a slap, lol.  When I got up It didn't seem like we were doing anything special.  I had breakfast and we finished packing and rushing around for unpacked things etc.  We finally got all our cases into the car with a big heave and we set of for San Antonio Airport.  We wandered around the shops n stuff while mum and sheldon had their last minutes together and then we went through the metal detectors and waved goodbye to Shel.  Btw, thanks Shel for putting up with us and making our time really great :D!  We got on our flight to Atlanta, which was quite ok.  When we arrived in Atlanta I was relieved that it wasn't as tense as when we came from England.  Well, probably because we didn't go through Immigration I don't know, but it was cool.  Our main flight home was brilliant.  We took off just after sunset at Atlanta when all the runway lights were on and everything, it was very cool!  It was quite strange because little orange flashes came from some of the clouds we passed, thunder maybe?  It turned night-time and we had dinner, watching 'Anger Management' as we ate.  A while after that everyone went to sleep.  I got a little bit of shut-eye but I couldn't really sleep that much really.  When I opened the window the view was great.  Stars were EVERYWHERE in the sky, it was really beautiful.  I could even see Orion up there, and even Mars at one point.  As we neared Ireland, it got light again, the sun rising and our breakfast being served.  We had a warm croissaint (Is that how you spell it?), a banana and a crispy oat and honey bar.  We soon came to land at good old Manchester Airport, greeted by an ENGLISH accent, yes I couldn't believe it lol!  After Daniel had a few minutes making fun of the way she said "Nine o' clock" (the time we arrived), we left the plane and wet to collect our stuff.  I'm not really that tired but I have a feeling this Jet lag is going to haunt us for a few more days :(  I still cannot believe I'm actually awake and living this, I'm convinced it's all a dream and I'm going to wake up back on the sofa in America... *Pinches arm really hard*  Ouch... :(
