I had many crushes in life and this blog is about the latest crush which i had in my life.. This happened about a month and half ago. I was coming back after my visiting my relatives.i was waiting for train inChengannur Railway station( for those who don't know abt thisplace, its a small town in alleppy district in Kerala).   I saw a pretty good looking girl on theopposite platform and she got my full 5 mins airtime. Because by that time my train came and so i had to leave. Well everytime i go for a trip i inadverently develop a liking towards girl(s), so looking at her and appreciating was nothing new for me. But this is different because i still remember her face distinctly, though i saw her face only for 5 mins that to when u she was sitting in the opposite platform.   Well the rational guy in me say it as an anomaly in the matrix( Refer: Agent Smith, Matrix Fame), But i don't know whether its just an anomaly because i am a pretty detached guy( atleast thats what i feel :-)) and i forget ppl pretty fast. Then u ppl may ask me what am i trying to say.. well i liked that girl so much ( u may call it infactuation , but i say a value added term "unknown attachement") that i wish i could meet her again in my life. Well i don't know her name nor what shes doing.. so lets see if i am that lucky..
