So, here's what's been going on in my ever so busy life.   -My Yearbook Croonies: Yeah, I got to see my yearbook buds tonight (minus Courtney, who was in class).  Next year I will be doing the Student Life section along with Lauren, my new co-editor, and we're going to create an even better book than last year's.  So many things are going to be different though...I'm having a hard time picturing just how different its all going to be.  The thought of getting ready to start making another yearbook is just shocking to me.  We just got done with last year's!  But, hey, anyway, it was good to see everyone again, not too much has changed with them.  Everyone's heard about my little accident that I had last week (even though it seems like an eternity ago), and they all think it's "typical David stuff."  I don't blame them.  Stuff like that happens to me all the time!  -Bad Cell Phone...BAD!: I have no idea what's going on with Nextel right now, but signal used to be so good out here in The River.  But, all of a sudden, it's going dead on me, and I can't get decent cell signal anywhere.  It really sucks, because now I can't talk to people that I don't normally talk to anyway.  Hopefully they fix this problem soon, because I need my phone!  -On the Road Again: Well, after yearbook dinner tonight, my brother is at a friend's house, and has to be picked up.  My dad, who is too tired to stay awake while driving, told me to go along with him, just in case he fell asleep and needed waking up.  So, I just spent the last hour on the road, having to go all the way down Fort Island Trail about 6 miles, and then back...total, it was about a 40 mile drive.  It sucks, but, oh well, I'm back.  -Spiderman 2: So, I'm probably going to Universal on Saturday to see Spiderman 2, and get on Mummy for the first time.  I've been dying to see the movie forever, and the game that I've been playing vigorously, has become one of my favorite games of all time.  I can't wait to see it, because the game follows the storyline, and I don't want to go much further without seeing the movie.  I've heard that it was really good, but, we'll see what happens.  If I don't go on Saturday, then I'm going to have to see it in the crappy movie theater out here in The River.  -Job Hunting: I'm afraid I'm going to start having to look for a job soon...I'm doing some of that typing for my mom, but, sometimes, it's really hard to keep up with.  The people who talk sometimes talk really fast, and I have a hard time typing and listening at the same time.  I'm probably going to apply some places soon, but, we'll see.  I don't know.  Jobs require coordination, and I have none of that.  So, about this late night bloggin' thing...I may make it a series.  Yeah.  And I can go bother other peoples' blogs, and tell people about it.  Sounds like a plan.  So, look for Late Night Bloggin', once or twice a week.  Why?  Because I feel like trying something new for a change.  I'm going to update tomorrow morning, and then I'm going to cut bagel.tech into only 2 posts tomorrow, since I have somewhere I have to go earlier in the day.  So, until tomorrow, then, get some sleep.  You probably haven't gotten too much lately.
