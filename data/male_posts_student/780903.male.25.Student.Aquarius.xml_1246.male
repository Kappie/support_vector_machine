Feedback is running in favor of Stampons over Democratic Debate so far, so given that I haven't been inspired with anything better, I guess I'll use Stampons at the first meeting of the sketch writing workshop I signed up for tomorrow night.  Figured it could be fun, a way to get some live feedback, motivate some writing, meet some other writers, etc.  And as long as I'm in Manhattan at work, I may as well do stuff after work that's fun.  Not that work isn't fun.  Of course work is fun.  Obviously.  The Tony Awards are on in a bit.  I'll probably watch them in the background as I write something percolating in my head about lunches paid for by the firm.
