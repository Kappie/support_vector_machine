Can I first start by saying: A yogurt parfait for only a dollar? I AM Lovin It! Anyways, its nice to see places like McDonalds, Subway, etc, trying to lighten up their menus for the health concious eaters out there. I think, however, that it really isnt doing any good. Winconsin has some of the most impressively fat people I have ever seen. It’s almost as if there is an award for gaining the most weight...like a pie or something. I will now ask the question that I can never answer...How do you let yourself get to be so big that you can barely make it up a flight of stairs?? I'm not sure whats worse, wondering what those people look like naked, or knowing that there are freaks out there (chubby chasers) that actually get off on a person that size.  I mean I like a little meat, no obese, not really skinny, above my weight is fine.  It you are like more then 50+ over me then we have a problem.  I think I will work in a factory one summer during college because The good part would be that I could see first hand what I could expect if I never finished college and knocked my old lady up. It was a good idea. I would be there hearing all about the lady at the tapping machine who happened to be dating a man of color and to hear all about how "wrong" it was, and how sad it was that such a  "catch" could be dissing her race to date someone outside of it. I also could meet a worker who sort of did everything. I might be paired up with him to haul some tables out of a room. During the 2 hours I spent with this guy he went from "Hi, my name is____" to "Yeah, you no whut I luv....fat gurls" (I spell the way this guy probably would have as an ode to him) "The bigger tha better". A chubby chaser that stood about 5'6" and weighed a hefty 130lbs.  So this leads me to another question not unlike the fat person question. What makes a person think that they can begin to unload that kind of information within a few hours of meeting someone? I understand letting it slip that your wife is a supermodel. Maybe I would try to work into the conversation how I saved a man’s life the previous week. Possibly, I would try to squeeze a mention of my millions made at poker, but explaining you’re racist??? Explaining what type of women you like to have sex with??? What leads these types of people to blurt this stuff out? So before I go, I just wanted to let anyone who may have just started reading this within the past few hours.... I use the word retarded a lot. Just a coupla thangs... Jeopardy seems to be getting really lax. I was watching and they had the category biography which was sort of like video clues each time. There seemed to be no time limit on answering and then for a daily double the lady waited, and waited, and waited...then finally, instead of a buzzer, Alex calmly said Rita? What has this world come to? Also there is a Seinfeld on that made me wonder. It’s the episode that Elaine and Jerry decide that they will make up rules and start to have sex as friends. So who would you pick of all your friends to bestow this honor on? I think I would have to think about this for awhile. It’s a difficult decision. It’s a really narrow pool to choose from. Well, I guess I will make a decision. I can see that the world is on the edge of their seats.  All of you! You are now entitled to some pretty exclusive benefits. I have an intimate knowledge of the genito-urinary region thanks. I live 1,100 miles away from my closest friend so I am always "looking for a good time". I've seen some porn lately and think I have figured out some things. I've yet to meet anybody with longer fingers than I have...and you know what that means. My fingers are double jointed and flexible. And you know what that means!  NOTE: I just wanted to apologize to my mom if she happens to  read this....just trying to be funny mom..Sorry.
