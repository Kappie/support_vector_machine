I want to play something, but nothing comes to my mind. I guess i'll watch a movie. I tought of Playing Battlefield 1942 or maybe Counter-Strike. I feel like playing a new strategy game tought. Maybe Red Alert II off Kazaa Lite?   I guess i'll get my brothers t.v and watch 2 Fast 2 Furious...  Regards,  Zephyr
