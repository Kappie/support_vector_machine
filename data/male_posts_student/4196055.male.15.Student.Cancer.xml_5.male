Anyways today started off the same as every day except for the fact I set my alarm to ten. Yeah.. why else would I be writing this at 10:30? I've still got my english and german homework to do I should probably start that today... later anyone who actually reads this.  Lyric of the Moment: So turn Up the corners of your lips Part them and feel my finger tips Trace the moment, fall forever Defense is paper thin Just one touch and I'd be in Too deep now to ever swim against the current So let me slip away So let me slip against the current So let me slip away.  Song: Vindicated Band: Dashboard Confessional. (Yes Dashboard does suck but I happen to like this part of this song.)
