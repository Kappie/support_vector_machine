I was shocked, a shiver ran down my spine, what was the world coming to if I could not bring myself to even sip on the Vodka Redbull that was in my hands?!?  It has been a cracking week here in Barca, bit of Oveja Negra on Monday and then onto Models Night at Bar-Salona on the Tuesday.  Managed to get ourselves a table, survived the dodgy Arabian music and then felt like 100% party pimps for the rest of the evening.  Waltzed on down to see Tom Cruise strut his stuff in Japan with Edgar and Steffen on the Wedsnesday, having been sufficiently amazed at his ability to pick Japanese up, off the cuff, in a couple of months decided that if Tom can do it so can anyone (will be going to Japan in the summer ;op).  Thursday was Weiteke's last night, a lounge at Carpe Diem was booked and bedded revelry did take place, VIP'd it until they kicked us out and then moved on to Club Sutton.  Met up with a some CEMS people and ended up at Bar Paris, guaranteed!  Friday, me and Steffen went all out, trying to educate the newcomers, so with a bit of a forsnizzle we moved onto the delights of Chupitos!  Even Edgar got involved and then stopped by the police for looking too dodgy!  After a condom and an orgasm or two we walked a little less steadily up the hill to Costa Breve.  Again Bar Paris afterwards, bo!    So me and Steffen arent so lonely any more, starting all over agin is real difficult, me and Edgar just talking this minute about how it aint the same without the chance to pop down to Scobie's and know your gonna see tim or ulli with their faces glued to the screen!    Ulli, if you dont wanna send an email then I dont mind doin it, would be cool to get a weekly update from everybody all across Europe.  As for me, thats my update done, so kids be good, enjoy your Sunday evenings wherever you are and maybe I will put some fotos up on Walker's website if he lets me and you can see what the class of 2004 looks like!  Ciao for now,  A
