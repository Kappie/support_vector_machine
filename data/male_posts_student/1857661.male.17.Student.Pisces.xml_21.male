Wanted to get it yesterday, but the Salem Power Station shop in KLCC didn't have it. Lousy.  ~I'm starting to be afraid of the Malaysian Idol autition. I don't know why. Mebbe cuz I haven't choose my song and I'm not prepared at all.   2 more exam papers to go and that is one of toughest paper of all time. Additional mathematics. Er...   ~Teachers' Day is coming. I can't wait to see the celebration in school as this is my last year in SSG!!!  I'll be back in the evenings, tell you what happened after that!
