If you have read the previous post, you would have noticed that I do not have an xbox, and therefore it would do me no good to purchase DOA 3, considering it is an xbox only title.  Well, the nice people at Tecmo have produced a solution for me.  Yes, you guessed it, it is DOA 2 Hardcore.      This version of the ever popular DOA series was released for the Dreamcast and PS2, the latter of which i own.  So, now i can enjoy some DOA action without my nemesis, the xbox.  DOA 3 looks almost like a complete copy of DOA 2, with a little updated graphics (due to the more powerful hardware).  There are probably a few story line changes within the game, but since i do not own an xbox, i will never know.      I have just finished researching this game completely too, down to the very price.  I have determined that EBGames does carry the game, will i find it in one of the conveniently located stores, i don't know, but i WILL look.  I have also noticed the price point is quite reasonable, at only $19.95 USD new.  I'm not sure what it would be in CND, but it's not going to be that much more.  And with this job coming up in a week, i'll have enough money to purchase it.  Oh the bliss...    Lates
