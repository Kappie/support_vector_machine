These guys are definitely talented musicians.    I can't really put my finger on who plays what...because they all switch instruments for each song. But if I had to, it would be like this:  Ryan Neighbors: Lead Vocals/Guitar/Drums/Keyboards Matthew Moore: Guitar/Bass Kirk Ohnstad: Guitar/Drums/Cow Bell  This band is definitely a band to look out for.   I saw their first show? I think? Last night with good pals Chris Higgins and Ryan Moore. It was awesome.
