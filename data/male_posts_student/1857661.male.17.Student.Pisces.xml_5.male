Reason?  1) The vocalist was soft.  2) The band was too loud. 3) The vocalist should have expressions.  4) The vocalist wasn't singing the right tune. 5) The vocalist was a bit pitchy. Next, the fashion show. It was good. Two thumbs-up. But the only problem has to do with some of the revealing clothes. There was a costume that looks liek it will fall anytime. There was one which shows 50% of the body flesh. Okay, I'm being a little bit conservative here. But it's a school.   ~ The dance performance was good. I liked it. But I have a thought. Christina can dance, Chou Yee can dance too, but Kim Vee's partner wasn't flexible enough. What else? The drama by the 4Sc1 was cancelled because the storyline of their sketch was Mr. Pong being accused of murdering Mr. Ah Lim. Their name sounds fmailiar huh? Next up is the food. It was good. The salad was delicious. The fried chicken was okay. But they didn't give us a spoon for the fried rice. I love the drink. Nestea rite? Or whatever it is.   The Prom King and Queen were so predictable. Everyone was placing their bets on Aaron and Pei Lu since the beginning. Aaron was brave enough to say that the thing that inspires him most in SSG is the girl of his dreams that is Chai Sin Cher who was there too. She was shocked, you can look at her face at that time. Astonished, yet happy. Julia was the runner-up for the Prom Queen. Well done Julia. Go for the Prom Queen title this year for the Form Five Prom Night. You can do it!  ~ Overall, well done to the Form Fours. They had put a lot fo effort and sacrificed their energy and time to make the event a success. Here are some of the pictures from the show. Captions are included.    Who is that? Kelly  lar ... looks like...     Kah Ming showing his talent. It's a nice pic, don't you think so?     Lie Peh with her own rendition of Colours of The Wind!     Kheng Loon and Christina...     Doctor and nurse, they must be havign some affairs!     Whoa! D.I.Y. isn't bad after all!     One of the best costumes.     What a lovely couple!     Heard that they spent a lot on the wedding gowns. Its worth it anyway!     You're in. You're the ultimate! It's automatic...      Yes... this is better. The Reason!     The Prom King accompanying the Prom Queen!!!
