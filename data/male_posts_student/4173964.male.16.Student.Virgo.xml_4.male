I was planning on going to this play at Olympic plaza with that girl. At the last minute she calls and says she doesn't have the car so she doesn't want to do anything tonight. Whatever. I decide to go down and meet the people we were going to see it with alone. I can't find them anywhere so I end up sitting in between the two people who encompass every stereotype me and a close ami hate about theater folk (I finally mentioned you in here Kirsten now...DANCE WITH ME). On my right was an old woman who wouldn't stop sniffing and sneezing through the whole show. On my left was a guy who laughed at all the wrong places (because of them funny accents) and wouldn't stop talking to what I believe was his wife/girlfriend/goat...UGH!! Bad day.  Came home and went for a run with my sister. Mother is being a C-rag (y'all know what that c stands for) as usual. Can't stand to be in the same room as her for more than a few minutes. She just randomly insults me for no apparent reason other than the fact that she is miserable and you know that saying... Yeah I actually can't quite recall it but whatever. Calls me weak and scrawny....Which I am in one regard but I could run circles around her fat ass... Bitch...Fuck it one more year left. Can't fucking wait. I'm putting serious thoughts into saving up and moving into some cheap apartment in Bowness during the year. It would be better than living here. Wow is that a depressing revelation.  I watched Kill Bill vol 2 again. So radical. Sam Jackson...Oh how I love thee. Even if you only had 4 lines. I wanna watch the Shaft remake now. Or maybe the new Star Wars...Or how about (duh) Pulp Fiction or (my personal favorite) Jackie Brown. All have much more Sam Jackson goodness. hhhmmm what else  Yeah it surprising how little has gone down these last few days. I went to a party last night. Got drunk then bored and stumbled home. A bunch of girls there told me I was the hottest guy there which was a definite ego booster. I've decided to myself this is gonna be the year of no regrets. Basically my whole life up until now has been a series of missed opportunities. I have enough regrets from the last 3 years alone to last a lifetime so I'm gonna try and not add any more this year. I don't really know where to start seeing as how my life is pretty much in shambles as of this writing. Whatever time for bed. Got an early start tomorrow (have to be at work by 11 am MY GOD) and so I shall depart and fall into dream world aided by the sweet melodic voice of one Bob Dylan.  You stay classy
