It's the angry voice of a marginalised youth, for nu-metal this seems to working class urban youth."  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  It was posted on a message board by someone named Cider Jim.  So basically, what Cider Jim is saying is that the genre of rap music is succesful (yeah right) because you can relate to it.   Okay, sure.  Maybe rap music  is  relatable to some people.  But not very many.  I mean, have you ever listened to these lyrics?  "I PUT THE WHISKEY IN THE HOT DOG WITH A SYRINGE!!!"  I don't do that.  I can't relate to putting whiskey in hot dogs with a syringe.  That's illegal . . . or is it?  But, even I can relate to some rap lyrics.   "WHAT? WHAT? RAISE THE ROOF! WHAT? RAISE THE ROOF!  IT'S MY BIRTHDAY! DAWGG!"  I can relate to that totally.  So, Mr. Cider Jim, I'd say you have a good point.  The average rap consumer  can  relate to the music they buy.  Whether it be injecting alcoholic beverages into children's food, or remodeling their roof on the anniversary of their birth, rap consumers have done it!  This myth has been busted by Justin Kline, Dog Extraordinaire!   Can you pass me some of that cider Jim?  All of this talking made me thirsty.
