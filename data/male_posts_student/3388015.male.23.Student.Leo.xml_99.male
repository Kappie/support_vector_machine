She absolutely refuses to take care of the cat... :)  Well, she meant cat and not car, but she can take care of my car if she wants.  On the way to pick Linda up for Golden Port, I saw one of my pet peeves, people who smoke in the cars with their kids in the back.  I looked in the rear-view mirror and she was puffing and blowing with her baby in the back.  Absolutely awful.  So my cat IMs people randomly, so what.  She likes you and she wants to talk to you.  What?  You haven't been IMed?  Well, that's just because she doesn't like you.  I got into my apartment and I noticed the cat on the top shelf of my closet.  It's 7 feet in the air, how she got up there is impossible.  I hope I don't come home sometime to ripped up clothes just so she could get to the top.  At Golden Port, I dined a fine meal with 50 Indians.  Sheila and Dimple's Indian camp couselors all came to Golden Port for dinner.  It was quite packed, but luckily, our food came out first while some people didn't get their food for 45 minutes or longer.  We ate a lot of great food.  Today my coworkers and I went to the Elmwood for lunch, we sat out on the deck.  It was great, a very nice lunch.  I enjoy going out with them, they're such interesting people, varying in opinions, humor and experiences.  All of them are older than me, which is a change of pace since most of my friends in my life are younger than me.  Today has been slooooooooooooow.  There isn't much going on.  Cindy stopped by after her class but had to go to work, but she then called me and we talked on the phone for an hour.  Amazing how I can still get work done and talk to her at the same time.  Our conversation went (and usually goes) like this:  Cindy: Fat fat, fat we're so fat. Luke: Gym gym gym, we should do the gym. Cindy: Let's eat tonight at Golden Port. Luke: Okay, wanna get some liquor? Cindy: Well, yeah.  Taco Bell at midnight?  Yes, we are horrible horrible people.  I was reading an  urlLink article  about an exhibit traveling the world that uses real bodies, deceased, in its display.  Parts of the bodys are opened and put together and displayed for visitors.  It's a real learning experience and I'd definitely would like to see it.  However, I find it funny when religion pokes its head into the mix. People feel its wrong and amoral to display dead bodies (even though these people donated their bodies when they died).    For example:  Eva Edwards was fascinated until she discovered the exhibit featured real human bodies. She quickly saw a conflict between her religious and scientific beliefs. "Religiously, we feel the body should be respected and buried," she said. "I don't really feel that scientifically."   Yes, because burying stuff and letting it rot and forgetting about it is so much better than preserving it so it won't rot and turn to dust and let people learn from it.  Ugh.   urlLink    Who the heck would let their cat weight this much?  Hopefully we can get out a little early today.  It's going so slow!
