Myself I  I want worries to go away,  but they come in bulk. Pilling up! Hai... I said "It failed." I know it won't. It will be a success! I trust I believe    thank you for your understanding  thank you for understand my worries thank you for listening to me thank you for your encouragement thank you for everything  A paper-made basket you made yourself, as promised every folding of the paper holds your encouragement  It holds a small note you wrote every words meant a lot to me. It fulfilled its task. It brighten my dull day.  Thank you!    You gave me, my life 18 years ago You are someone I should love You are someone the least I should hate  But now You are someone I hate the most. You made my day worst. You never understand me. You never think of what I feel, since young You never understand my day  You only think of "wild" plans for me You only want me to take the Exams you wanted me to You only want me to get to US as soon as possible You only want me to have friends who are successful You only talk to me about what kind of life I should get You only talk to me about how successful are other kids You only talk to me about how fat I am You only want me to go in the way which you want me to  I tried to talk to you I tried to tell you how I feel I tried to open up to you I tried to tell you my problems I tried to share my happiness I tried to share my pain But you never listen I gave up.  You have nobody to vent your anger on but only Me and Mum.  You should be someone I love But I hate you.  --------------------------------------------------------  To people in my ExCo,PExCo and MExCo who bright my days, in my days of darkness Thank you! I love all my friends!
