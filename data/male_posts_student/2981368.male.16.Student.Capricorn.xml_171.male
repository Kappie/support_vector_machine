As in, they've all gone off to school for a day, then they're going. Yay for them. Hope they all have fun. In a week 'n' a bit I'll be leaving for the U-S-of-A. For 3 weeks. So...this place is gonna be pretty damn quiet till August. Unless I can find a net cafe or something. And can be bothered to post something.  So...yeah. Most of today I was reading through old emails. Mostly between me and Nat. V funny, actually. One of her closing *things* instead of just "bye" or "see ya" was:  "Now I'm being herded off the comp like so many wild sheep...  Baaaa...I mean bye"  Mmmmm. Boring day.    Its a cartoon version of me! ...Sorta.
