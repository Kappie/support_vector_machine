I feel as if... as if life is slowly fading away, and every day I cry crimson tears for my beloved dead comrades.  I fear not death; I fear not the scorn of what shall come to pass.  I fear but only one thing, to die without love, to die with nothing but hate inside of my heart.  Love, what is love? Love is something fabricated by man, to make you think you need it, but really, you do not.  You may be thinking I have just contradicted myself, but really, have I?  I think not, for I once felt this so called love, but now, I do not, and I shall never feel it again.  Death's sweet embrace, take me to my grave.
