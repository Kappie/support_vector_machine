My social life is breaking down. I feel anti-social. It is not my intent to talk to anyone at all. I'm satisfied with the few people I can talk to. But now, they all seem to be walking away. I can only feel loniness. I can only fall on my family now. That's one thing that remains constant in my heart.  People tell me that they are encourage by my sharing. But I just cannot make out what I was saying. I was just sitting in front of the entire YF, almost screaming out my feelings. I felt better after that. Even I teared as I returned to my seat. Why did I tear? What is it that made me tear...? I am not sure. But I felt better...  The painting above is only a scribble. Everyone says it's abstract. Indeed, it is deep. Messy lines filled with intense mystery. But yet, it feels so empty. It's like opening thousands of doors and locks, and in the end find this empty space which was supposedy the expected reward and final success. But only to find darkness and silence. Darkness so blinding, and Silence so deafening.  I am cold From within the heart. So hardened and void. Stealth, Yet not peace. Tearing Into thin air. Drops from the eye, Falling into constant movement, where there is no direction. Like a scribble, 'Filled' with rage And strength in each stroke, Yet only emptiness. Like thousands of doors, Locks and lockets, Opening into a revelation Of a mystery. Mystery is revealed. Darkness so blinding, And silence so deafening. Like behind a star. From fiery beauty, To vacuum.
