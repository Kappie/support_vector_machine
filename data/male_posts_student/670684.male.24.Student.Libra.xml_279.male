Didn't catch any home runs, though I was within five rows of one ball on Friday.  Caught a lot of flak for wearing my Tony Gwynn replica jersey T-shirt on Friday, but also found a girl smelling failtly of hallucinogens who wanted to buy the shirt off my back.  She had big hoop earrings and a large ass.  It would be hers had she a Brad Ausmus bobblehead doll.    For those unaware of Brad Ausmus, he is the catcher for the Houston Astros.  Catcher is an interesting position in the game of Baseball...it's probably the toughest position on the body, as it requires you to squat behind a plate for nine innings, get hit by foul balls, foul tips, errant baseball swings, and catch 90+ mph balls in a mitt with not near enough padding.  But it's also the last stronghold of the Good Ol' Boys Club of MLB.  Catchers signal pitches to the pitcher.  If we give the pitcher less credit than he deserves (often the case), then we credit the catcher for  calling a good game  and  providing calm and confidence  to the thrower on the mound.  Because of this, many in the world of baseball don't expect much hitting or run producing from the catcher's spot in the lineup.  And this is why Brad Ausmus still has a job...this, and every once in a while he'll hit three home runs in a game, throw out a few runners, and get traded to Detroit only so he can be traded back to Houston by year's end.    It was Brad Ausmus Bobblehead Doll Night on Friday, where the first 20,000 kids 14 and under received a free doll.  There were only 26,000 people total at the game, but because of my cheering on the visiting team and other sundries, I received not a doll.  I wanted a doll not just because it was a giveaway, but because Brad Ausmus is kind of a cult idol.  He started his career as a Padre, and then brought us Chirs Gomez and John Flaherty in a trade, and Gomez became one of my favorite Padres after that.  Ausmus had a few good hitting years, and now plays a good defense with no offense catcher for Houston, who will not re-sign him in the offseason.  It looks like the Padres will, and that is not a good thing, because if you need a catcher and there are better catchers available, there's no need to pick up Ausmus just because he looks calm, reads books, and has "intangibles."  Intangibles are the stuff of legend.  If you can't explain why someone in baseball does something well, it's because he has intangibles.  Brian Hunter might not be able to hit a baseball out of the infield, but he keeps a job in the game because he brings intangibles.  What are intangibles?  I can't say, because they are intangible...if he hit well, if he threw out baserunners well, if he was quick of foot, we would say that he was a good hitter, a good defender, or a fast player.  But he's none of those...yet he still gets paid a lot to play a game that, at face value, he is no good at.  Thus we face a conundrum, and while you beat your face into the nearest cement pillar trying to reason why Brad Ausmus is squatting behind the plate for $2.5 million a year and Ivan Rodriguez, who hits quite well, is bringing his style of play to the Baltimore Orioles.    Back to Austin tomorrow, and real work begins.  Screenplay looks good, meeting up with a few old friends and a few new ones as well.  Saw a pretty good film called The Housekeeper yesterday...French bit about a 50 year old who ends up with a 20 year old through circumstance, and how that relationship develops...doesn't glamourize or unnecessiarly dramatize, but just gives a description.  Several friends of mine should watch.
