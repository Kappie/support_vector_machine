As is to be expected from a director such as Tarantino, this movie is filled with blood, gore and violence. The beginning of Kill Bill shows Uma Thurman's unnamed character lying beaten and bloody on the floor. We watch as the mysterious Bill calmly strides up, explains his reasoning for killing her, and shoots her in the head with a single bullet.   And that's all we see of the plot for a while. We watch and wince as Uma and a former comrade kick the living crap out of each other in a living room, breaking glass coffee tables and flipping shelves and tables over. Get used to these scenes, people. After this first fight scene, the remainder of the movie is a flashback in which Uma's character awakes from a three-year coma with a lust for revenge. Bill and friends crashed her wedding and someone's got to pay.   Six people, actually. Uma decides to kill the six assassins present at the wedding massacre, and she writes them (color-coded) on a yellow pad of paper so she won't lose trak. And that's where the plot hits a road block. The remainder of the movie consists of Uma's character tracking down the first assassin on her list, played by Lucy Liu.  We recieve a taste of storyline when Uma tracks down the legendary swordsmith Hitori Hanzo and he makes her a katana of the finest steel. This sword will taste a lot of blood by the end of the movie. Uma finds the assassin and her posse at a Japanese restaurant. After cutting off the arm of her secretary and letting her spray gallons of blood in a disgusting torrent, Uma sets about killing all 88 of Liu's guards. And that's where I lost interest.   The beginning of the fight scene is exciting and gripping and had me on the edge of my seat. But by the last few guards, we pretty much know she's going to win without problem. I mean, come on, she's killed 60 guys already, what's 28 more? Seriously.   Anyway, Kill Bill Volume 1 is twice the violence and none of the plot. But that's what Volume 2 is for, right?
