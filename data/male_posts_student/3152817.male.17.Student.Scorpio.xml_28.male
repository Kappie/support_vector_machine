Slim Fast decided to stop airing the TV ads after Whoopi made inappropriate comments, relating the president's last name to women's pubic hair, at a Kerry fundraising event in NYC.    Finally a celebrity has to feel the bite from all the barking they do about the president.  What is it anyway, that makes famous people think that run of the mill people care about their political opinions?  Multi-millionaires like Goldberg don't have the same self-interests as average Americans.  When was the last time a major actor like Martin Sheen worried about his job being sent to India?  When was the last time Madonna worried about whether or not she would have enough money to make it till her next paycheck?  Seriously, where do celebrities get the illusion that average people care what they think?  To echo the words of Laura Ingraham, " urlLink Shut Up and Sing! "
