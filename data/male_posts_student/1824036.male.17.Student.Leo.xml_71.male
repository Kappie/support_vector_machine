I looked into the gym where they were warming up and saw Jadie. She looked so pretty, so athletic, so so...GREAT! I couldn't believe how great she looked. She looked so pretty. Now I dont throw words like this around very much but it is the truth. Jadie almost looked completely different. And no that does not mean that I think she isn't athletic or that she isn't pretty/good looking, etc. etc. She looked great.  Jadie I love you!
