I guess after pursuading her mom, she was able to go. When we picked her up, things were somewhat awkward. I tried to make small-talk because she was being quiet. I sounded like a   complete   idiot, but I tried for conversation. When we got to the mall, my mom and my sister went through a store and Rachel and I went to wander around the mall. It isn't a big mall, so we lapped it in about 20 minutes. (we had two hours) About half way the second time around, I asked Rachel to do something that I had planned on asking her for quite some time. She didnt want to for specific reasons. It hurt, but I understood. Things were awkward afterwards. I kept beating myself over it. We would be walking and I noticed that we were really close; so I backed off so that I didnt offend her. I enjoyed it, but again, I didnt want to scare her off anymore. The rest of the time was "eggshelly" (as she put) for the both of us. But all-in-all, I had a great time.
