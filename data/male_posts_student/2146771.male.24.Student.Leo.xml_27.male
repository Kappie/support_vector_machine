Well, car sales have improved.  Actually enough to pay our taxes even!  We have some busy months ahead of us with 3-4 weddings, the church directory, Brooke is doing finals now and then she'll start the summer semester.  We're coming to MN the weekend of the 24th of April.  Anyone want to hook up let us know!  Our numbers are under the contact section.  Hope to hear from you!  I gotta go to work now so see ya later!
