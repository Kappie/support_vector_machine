I don't really know why, but, when I was small, the national day festivity and celebrations made me feel as though that National Day is one special day. But, as I grow older, National Day seems to be just another ordinary day without school. As I see the National Day Parade beind shown on my television screen, I feel that it's just a replay of the previous years' parades. It's kinda meaningless, repeating the same message again and again every National Day. Why don't they just play a replay of last year's parade? The parade makes Singapore seem like a country with an intresting history, and a country filled with intresting people. But, I think that there's nothing intresting about Singapore. I wonder how can people love a country full of posers? I know myself that even though I'm a Singaporean, I hate Singapore. It's filled with a lot of self-centred people. A land filled with inconsiderate people. I say so because, I remember that when most of us were very young, we were taught only to care about ourselves. We were taught by our parents, caretakers, grandparents, aunts and uncles, babysitters to only care about ourselves. When people are in trouble, we must walk away as though nothing has happened. This is what most of us were taught. This is what I was taught.  I wonder if we can spot our own flaws. I know this person from my class, he likes to spot flaws of other people and make fun of them. But, he cannot spot his own flaw. When people try to tell him what's wrong with him, he doesn't even bother to change. I used to treat this person as a friend, until I found out how irritating and hateful he can be. He is insensitive to other people's feelings, he only cares about himself. He loves to make fun of people behind their backs. I really hate him. But, I just don't want to show it. He is just so damn fucking irritating. But, a lot of people are his friends. They just don't see the other side of him.He makes use of everyone around him. Some of us hate him, but, we don't show it. W hate him just because of the fact he makes use of everyone around him. He doesn't give a fuck about how others feel. So, we don't give a fuck about him. We just pretend to be his friend.
