I worked with Samantha, whom I've never worked a Saturday with. She's pretty fun to work with, but... she's... kind of slow on working on work orders and stuff. After that I went to San Diego with the girls from Cambridge to go to the SD Fair and visited Julia. It was pretty fun. The fair was cool... although expensive. Heh at least I managed to rip off the evil Pizza Hut there. Because they were taking forever on my personal pan pizza ( which would have been totally tiny ), I had them give me 2 massive slices of pizza instead. After the fair, we hung out and Julia's where we spent the night. We watched some of Janet's videos... some of which I star in. That was pretty cool. We drove back around 8:30 AM and got back to Irvine around 9:30. I drove pretty fast. Pretty much after that... I slept. It was a good weekend overall.  Let's see my plans for the week... work tomorrow... go to the doctor and work on Tuesday... Wednesday I have a phone appt and work. Thursday is the 4th of July... not sure what I'm gonna do. Work on Friday night and Saturday morning. Kind of a busy week.   ***
