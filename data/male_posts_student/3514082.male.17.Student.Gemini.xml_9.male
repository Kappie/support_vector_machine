I have a relaxing week ahead of coaxing into college at random times every now and again, see a few friends, do no work and come home, and as mum and dad have gone to greece for the week i will have the house to myself half the time. I hope your having fun Ryck. I hope the weather clears up soon as i can get back in the pool, and laze in the sun. Also heavily analysing university prospectuses, Kent really takes my fancy. Anyway I'm tired and your probably bored reading this so I'm off to bed. Night Alex
