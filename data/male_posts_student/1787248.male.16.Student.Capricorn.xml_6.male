Anyways, Team Fear the Mullet might be in full force at Gen Con, considering I am told there is a miniscule chance I could still be going. I'd have to preregister my Gen Con badge (waiting in line is a pain in the ass)get to the bus station after the first day of school, get on a Greyhound heading for Indianapolis, have Joe pick me up at the bus station in Indy, then head to the convention center equipped with my mullet and my Raw Deal decks. I'm not so sure if the plan is perfect, there would be muchos expenses, but as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing like Gen Con, it is the most amazing gaming convention EVA.   See you guys later, I gotta go work on some Wisconsin Style decks for the Diva's Overload era just in case I get to go.  Later Days, bitches.
