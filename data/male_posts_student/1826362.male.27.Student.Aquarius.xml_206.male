I think I had a much better feel for Seattle, and I only lived there for a little longer than I have here.  And I feel like I know Savannah better than philly, And I've only spent a few days there.   I hang out in my little area coffee shop, The Last Drop.  I eat at my local pizza shop.  I ride the subway from Lombard-South to Cecil B. Moore.  and that's pretty much the extent of my Philly experience. But I am looking forward to being reacquainted with Boston this Summer.  I'll be there May 12.  Hope to see you there.
