Just started this so I could write down stuff that I wanted to, hehe.  Yep, I'm tired as butt, because i went to sleep at like, 2 this morning, and had to get up at 7 for drivers ed.... so yawn, that was pretty tiring.  Yesterday was fun.  After driver's ed, i came home and ate lunch, and the nextdoor neighbors (my sisters friends) came over and we had a big pillow fight, which was totally awesome.  Then Claire came over and we hung out for like, pretty much the rest of the day.  She's awesome.  We walked down to Cary Woods and messed around there for a while, until we lost a kickball on the roof, then we left.  We came home, and I went out to eat with my mom and sister, and Claire went home.  Then after dinner I met back up with her, and we ended up meeting up with Trevor, Vladimir, and Titus.  We went over to Vladimir's house, and played with fire.  They had some fuel for gas-powered remote control cars, and it burnt a really cool color.  They ended up blowing the bottle up on accident, which made a huge fireball, which was totally awesome!  Then we just hung out for a while, until around 10:00, then we all went home.  It was totally fun though.  Well... yeah, today has just started, so... can't really say much about it, hehe.
