First the ice skating rink, then the free doughnuts and coffee in the student center for studying, and now this:   Dear Student Organization Presidents and Treasurers:  Thanks to the work of [other people] and the generosity of Dean Kagan, Friday the 13th (of February) has turned into a lucky day for student organizations. Dean Kagan has increased the amount of money that the Student Funding Board can allocate to student organizations on campus. In order to assure equitable distribution of the funds, the SFB will be accepting budget requests for supplemental funds... Money won't buy student happiness.  Unless maybe it will.
