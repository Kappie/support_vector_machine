While Google is really innovative with new products they lack experience that other industry leaders such as Yahoo already have.  As my experience yesterday with sending automated email to my account, I never received it.  I suppose we'll wait and see.....  For now I'm still using Yahoo as my primary spam account, and of course I still have my personal email account with a ISP that I pay for.
