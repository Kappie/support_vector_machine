Damn you, Blog! Damn you! The hours went by slow.. or did they go by fast? I can't tell, but I know I saw every number from one to seven in the hour's slot on my digital clock. However, it seemed each and every hour held its own eternity. Each hour had its own goal (THE ETERNAL HOUR'S GOAL I WOULD THINK TO CALL IT!). Hour one consisted of me figuring out what the hell I was dealing with.. I haven't used HTML in so long! MONTHS! YEARS! I had become dependant on FrontPage and DreamWeaver.. what a shame.. And now, in the first eternal hour, I had none of these programs to do the work for me, I was lost. But soon enough, I figured it out... took me a while though, didn't it? Even with those labels.. it took me a while. DAMN YOU WRETCHED BLOG.. AND HTML.. what a dirty language it is.. like one of those African dialects... or Vietnamese. So on I progressed towards the second eternal hour: the hour of brain storming. Braing storming through ideas: color schemes, images, organization.. I did not make very much progress. In fact, I had only decided on T.G.I.F colors during the last couple minutes of the second eternal hour. Until then, green and brown was in my head. It couldv'e worked, methinks. METHINKS... On to the third eternal hour i trodded along. The hour of image creation! THE BANNER TOOK ME FOREVER. I couldn't replicate it if i tried. I can only render work of art through pure luck! I ran into better images.. but my fucking Photoshop closed damnit! But eventually i ran into this image.. and there it is. And the forth hour? Haha. That is for me to know! And for you to find out that you cannot know! And the fifth eternal hour? The fifth????? I don't remember. But i ended up with the background image, which went on the background, including the my self-portrait (of myself) which I slapped on. Then the sixth hour! The sixth hour was the hour of festivities.. among... me... and myself! It's a celebration, bitch! Enjoy yoself! Oh god... and now I've broken into the seventh eternal hour.. the hour of the explaning of the previous eternal hours and their goals... All this! And i Come UP WITH THIS layout!!!! I AM SO.. PATHETIC....... nods.... nods... noooddss............  And that's my time.. I am the Walrus; g00 g00 g'j00b.
