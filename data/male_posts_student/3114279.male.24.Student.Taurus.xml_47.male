      I guess everyone is too busy to post lately.  I haven't really had the time or reliable internet access.  I've started looking around for apartments here in Naples.  I was planning on staying where I'm living now until the end of August, but I'm not sure I can do that.  I'd really like to have my own place.  There are some pretty decent sounding places in Golden Gate, which is the area of Naples where I work.  I'm going to check a few places out; it all depends on what kind of money I can get together.  Work has been going well.  So far it's been glorified babysitting.  I haven't been able to participate in group sessions yet or really get to know the kids and get into their heads.  I really like the job so far, and I'm sure I'll like it more when I no longer feel so new and overwhelmed.  Tomorrow will finish my first week of work and my second week living in Naples.  Not much else to write.
