Who cares if people think I'm wrong....this is the way I do things....and fuck it. I'm not fucking prince charming. So why should I fucking pretend to be? I should NOT have any fucking expectations to live up to. I know it sounds selfish....but after a year of asshole parents and their expectations...why can't I just be me, and not have people breathing down my fucking neck? I know....I'm most likely exaggerating reality....but thats how it FUCKING feels.   O-FUCKING-KAY I know.......David has to go......but I don't think its my job to fucking kick him out. Who knows? even if I do say something, how in the FUCK does anyone know he'll listen? FOR ALL I KNOW HE FUCKING WON'T DO ANYTHING!!!! it isn't my place... I wasn't there during their relationship, and I have no voice, except that of Kaya's new, caring boyfriend. She has to do this.....I know in my fucking heart that she HAS to do this. I can't "protect" her. Why does she need protection??? she OBVIOUSLY showed loyalty....in not cheating on me then and there.....which obviously means she cares MORE about me than him....because SHE DIDN"T CHEAT ON ME WITH HER EX BOYFRIEND....who seems to relentlessy torture her. She needs to do this...because it is a lesson she needs to learn. It isn't me teaching it....I just want to encourage her to do this. She should do this because, what if, in the future, she has to deal with a manipulator, and doesn't have elan to stand up for her? (hypothetical situation) I"m not scared of doing it. I just don't want this opportunity to be missed. If, however, she can't do it, for ANY reason, I will do what I'm "supposed" to do, and simply tell him, in any means that Kaya wants to be bothered no more, and that I'm the boyfriend now...so he should leave her alone. He might still be attached to her....but thats pretty fucking selfish of him, to come with apologies and tears, expecting something in fucking return. If something else happened, that you didn't tell me about (Kaya.) tell me. Tell me. tell me. I'm here to listen ~Elan P.s. comments...however, this was NOT, and I repeat, NOT an attack on anyone. It was just me venting. Its true...I'll do it if she doesn't...but I think she should. all my love to all my friends, and I don't hate ya'all
