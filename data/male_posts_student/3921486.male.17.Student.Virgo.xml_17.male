So i didn't want to bother her and decided well i plan to go myself anyways.  So i started out pretty cool and drove there but I made a fast turn. Park, went in and got sign and went out and went to Mcdonalds. I had some troubles with the lights turning yellow and then not sure when i should turn and other traffic lights rule that i had forgot but going to review it now.  But i went to Mcdonalds drive through and got a salad and went home. I had to find a way out of Mcdonalds also b/c the exit that I took out of the drive through was only one way which is the opposite way of my house but i manage to turn into some store and went around and got home SAFELLLLLLLLLLLLY. phew!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  What I learn from this, Is what a bad driver I am. But practice will make it perfect..... I  hope. So wish me luck on the rode. And if your driving next to me.....ummm good luck!
