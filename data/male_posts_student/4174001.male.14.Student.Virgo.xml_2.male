I then preocedded to get instructiong from the IC and he stationed me beside the stage whos job is the easiest... Stand there and not let people walk accross the stage...and sit down when the show starts. Catch people using video cams and children sitting on railings.... The first show was intersting but the second show made me fall asleep...
