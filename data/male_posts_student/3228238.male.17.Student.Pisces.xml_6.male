There was incense filling the church.  We received the Body and the Blood under both species, through intinction.  Intinction is where the host is dipped into the chalice and then placed on the communicant's tongue.  There were several girls in beautiful white dresses, receiving their first communion.  After Mass, there was a procession of the Eucharist around the church grounds.  The congregation followed Christ in the monstrance, while singing hymns of praise. We stopped at two distinct altars, beautifully decorated.  What a great experience!  I learned that people do this all around the world; not only the Latin American countries, but also in Europe.
