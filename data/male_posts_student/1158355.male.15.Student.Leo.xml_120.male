We make fun of James' girlfriend because she looks like she's 2 so people are saying "Where is she?," and James says "She takes 10 minutes to get here." Then I replied with "That's because she has to come all the way from Smithtown Elementary. Paul almost spit out everything in his mouth. The whole table loves how I laugh different ways, all the different variations of laughter. You probably all think, stop talking so much about yourself...what do you think this is for? To talk about other's lifes? Nine! MINE! Ok, well I'm gonna work out tonight with Paul, and drum...well I drum everyday. Later.
