I'd never been in an intensive care unit until today, and let me just say I hope I never go back in one ever again.  It is extremely freaky and very sad.  I'm not going to cut any corners here (but know that my grandmother  is  fine).  We went in, down a long hallway, then you turn right and go into a large open space full of nurses' desks.  Off to the sides of this room are the intensive care rooms.  The doors to these rooms are like airtight doors, the closest way I can describe them is like the automatic doors at some stores, except you have to open them manually.  Some of them are covered up because the person in the room is near death.  There was one family standing outside the room next to my grandmother's in tears because they couldn't decide whether or not to pull the plug on their grandmother.  Anyway, I went in my grandmother's room and she was laying there on the bed.  She looked asleep.  Ok, quite honestly, she looked dead, even though her color was good.  I had been told before that it was normal because of the pain killers she was on that she would act like this.  So I go in and say "Nana, do you know who I am?"  She couldn't talk (she can now, I'll get to this later), but she shook her head yes.  I asked her if she was in pain and she shook her head yes again.  After seeing her on saturday as the vibrant, funny lady that she is, it was very depressing to see her like this.  Ok, now enough of the doom and gloom BS.  After me and my mom left, the pain medications began to wear off and the swelling in her brain began to decrease more and more.  My aunt said that, as of now, she has "awakened" and is acting relatively normal and was cracking jokes with everyone that visited.  She is very tired, but they're moving her to a regular room in the morning.  The doctor came and said everything looks great right now.  She can't move her right arm or leg, but physical therapy should allow her to regain movement in them.  He rated her cancer as a 4 on a scale of 1-10, so that's pretty good too.  Anyway, on to something else, I have my final tomorrow at Berkmar for my online class.  I have to make a 58 or above or I have to take it again.  My test average is 78 and you can't have a final exam grade of less than 20 points below your test grade.  I haven't studied at all for the final yet.  Oh well, I should be fine.  I made a 61 on the one in the regular class and I know the material much better now.  Me and Andrew were talking tonight about how he misses a female friend of mine and it made me think of what I may be dealing with in a year.  I'll be in college somewhere.  It has dawned on me that this is the last year with some of my favorite people in the world.  Britt is going to Tech, probably, so me and him will still see each other, but lord knows where else everybody else is going.  Alex will be in the Naval Air Corps school, most likely, so that will be weird.  That SOB flying fighter jets is scary. :-)  Oh well, I'm gonna shut up now.  Keep praying for my grandmother.  She is doing well.
