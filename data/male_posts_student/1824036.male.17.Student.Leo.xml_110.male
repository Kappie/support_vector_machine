I think my job shadow was one of the the best! I played some fooz-ball, ping pong, and even had time to go out to eat!  Friday we won our last game of the season. I dunno why we did so bad at the beginning of the year...we lost a lot of our games by just a couple of points.  Hmmm....what else?   What about your guitar???   Oh yeah! I am just starting to learn the acoustic guitar. And hopefully by the time I am a senoir I will be good enough to form a band. I dont know if I will be any good...or if I will be ready by then. Heck I dont even know if I am any good at the thing...I'm doing some very basic things. Dont know any chords really yet. Just dinkin around. Yeah...if I get good, I have a band in mind....  **smirks**  Only time will tell
