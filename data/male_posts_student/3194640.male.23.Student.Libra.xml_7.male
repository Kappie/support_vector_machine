I'm kind of annoyed, because, after work, I have to drive all the way out to  urlLink Butler  (that's where I go to school) to get my book receipt from their bookstore. Why? Because they gave me a wrong receipt and they have a dumb policy that requires me to have my book receipt so they can buy back my books at the end of the semester. Dumb? I think so.   Word.
