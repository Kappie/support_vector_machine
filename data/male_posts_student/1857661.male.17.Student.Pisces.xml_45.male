Anyway, I just received an sms just now stating:   Congrats! Ur application 4 Malaysian Idol Audition is successful. Ur audition is on 9/6/04, 9am-5pm, 6th flr Berjaya Times Square. Make sure U arrive on time.   9am! I have to go there before 9! Oh my gawd! Sigh... hopefully I will be the first few ones so that my audition will be earlier. I hate waiting although I do have patience.  A short one today, because I have nothing much to say. Tomorrow shall be the same routine, wake up, bath and eat, work, work, lunch, work, work, dinner, work, blog, sleep...
