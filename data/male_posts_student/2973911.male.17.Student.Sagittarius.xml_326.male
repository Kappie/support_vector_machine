Weird thing about the alchemy of thoughts: I concocted a dream that mixes all love tragedies I've seen in reality.  I am practically reliving one of the professors in FERN who got expelled out of the school for failure in quality.  But other students think of it as something else (this doesnt get out or Dacasin will shoot me right between the eyes).  I don't know why this should be hidden, taboo, or anything, but I guess people are just narrowminded, superstitious cowardly lots.  He had an issue with a student.    My dream is about the same thing.  I was such a teacher, and everywhere, this "taboo" of mine was becoming open, though in tabloid rumors and stuff.  I don't know, but I really sometimes hate being against the society, though I am already radical and stuff.   You can say I'm still afraid of them.  I would rather disappear than be thrown stones at.  But c'mon, is it really that bad?  The dream made me question, did the professor expelled really deserve receiving such?
