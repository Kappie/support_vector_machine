I spotted all the issues Or at least I hope I did Looked in every corner of the fact pattern where they hid  I took my pile of outlines Made with tender loving care And now that exams are over, threw them in the dumpster over there...  (...and picks up tempo...)  They're over Exams are over Take that term of jurisdiction And pretend that it was fiction Forget all the little details About merchants, goods, and resales Don't lose sleep over that murder Cause it's not a crime you've heard of... anymore Exams are over and the books are off the floor ...and in a drawer ...or in the trash ...or sold for cash ...or out the window as they smash ...onto than man and leave a gash ...is it a crime? is it a tort? ...who knows? who cares? take me to court! ...but i don't know because exams are finally done ...and it's time to start the fun... of next semester.  (...back to the ballad...)  Explained it with precision Hit the word count on the dot But the moment it was over, all law I forgot  They say do no post-mortems Don't re-check, re-think, reflect I can't go back regardless, because the spine of all my casebooks is now wrecked...  (...pick up tempo again...)  They're over Exams are over Take the statutes and their sections Leave them for the trash collections Take the study guide you saved for Ask what have you been enslaved for Now you're free from all the study No more casebook is your buddy... not today Exams are over and so now it's time to play ...perhaps to pay ...for all the books ...the bookstore crooks ...say you will need for class that starts ...in just five days when break departs ...and then it all comes back again ...when will it end? when? when? when? when? ...cause after school we'll all get jobs and they're no fun! ...so what's the point of being done... when all that we have won... ...is another semester... of... this.
