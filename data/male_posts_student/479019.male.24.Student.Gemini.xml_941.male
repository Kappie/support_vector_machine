After that I went to Steff's birthday celebration at the Spectrum. It was very enjoyable, despite everything at the Spectrum being overpriced.   The following is mostly in response to Crystal's dropkicks on an earlier post.   The issue of people who dress punk, makes me think of the end of the movie SLC Punk and some of the questions raised. At what point is clinging on to a certain aspect of a genre, scene, etc. unrealistic? How much does a changing society as well as a growing person deal with this?  Call me an old man at 24, but it's seems to me a lot more teenagers sport the "look" than us older folks. While I have nothing against people's freedom of expression, I guess what I'm trying to question the juvenile tribalism of this (by juvenile I simply mean youth). I don't really think that mohawks, leather jackets, etc. are real markers of the lifestyle, as that stuff is all fluff and spectacle. They say less about punk, than the individual and what they think is or isn't punk. One only has to think about how people talk about authenticity.  It should be noted that back then, not every one dressed that way (especially in the diverse LA scene). Also most of the bands themselves do not dress that way anymore. So what does that mean? What does it mean when a couple in their 30s tries to show their 10 year old how to mosh in a museum? Is this reverance and preservation of cultural simulacra?  Crystal suggested that you can't help it if corporations encroach on the lifestyle, and things change, but can stay true. However, if you accept that, does that mean you accept that Sum 41 and A New Found Glory are in some way just as valid of punk as Black Flag and the Damned?  I don't have the answers, but I think that a problem is that a lot of younger people who listen to punk "buy" into the music without thinking about what they are doing. That's my whole point of raising these questions. I would, of course, never say that the people whom I've shared time in the pit with are all poseurs. It's just that I worry about these kids, who end up growing out of punk rock, because they never really understood what they were doing to begin with.  ***
