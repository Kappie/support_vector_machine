I post whatever here for me and only me to read. If you are really such a nuisance and insist on reading, fine. There's nothing i can do. Fingers are yours, eyes are yours, brain is yours... Go ahead and do whatever you like! Hopefully you have mental crush after reading...   In case you are wondering why i am writing here, or why am i even starting this blogger thingy. I don't really know too. I am just curious about writing online journal, and how it would affect me in any way, or should i say even affect me at all. I don't like to write in a diary book, i think it's not safe as someone might steal it( don't ask me why, some people steal things for the kick of it, Mental). The other reason is my hand writing is too illegible that i don't think an idiot can even imagine a word out of it. But i do admit one thing: It's better to write in a diary, it has more value( and also keep kay pos away).   Life is short... lives are long...*dreaming...* Ehem! Eh..huh?! Oh oh.. i am writeing a blogger now.. Pai sei pai sei... As i was saying, life is short(Not lives are long). How long do you think one person can live up to? 70s? 80s? 90s? Scientists claim that humans, yes us, cannot live pass 120 years of age. Why? How i know? I forgot to ask them. Curse? nah... no such thing. Lifestyle? Maybe... Humans like to eat junks... Humans' favorite activity is stressing themseleves up by working hard all day all night(hehe...)... Or humans just prefer to die before 120 years old?( Unbelievable but true). Whatever it is, life is short... (sidetrack again... forgot what i wanted to say...) Oh... life is short, try to think about it, how many meaningful things have you did in your past years from the day you enter this pretty world? Anything worth remembering? Any great achievement?(except screwing teachers up) Most of you will say not really much... and i know that's a lie. The truth is, NO! Some of you might have...   There are many things for you to achieve, but not many people grab the opportunities. Why? Many people think that it's no use tiring yourself up just to achieve something. They see opportunities as swayness. But try to think about it, what is the purpose of life? Or should i put it this way, what is the purpose of YOUR life? Is it to step foot on this world and relax... slacking day and night(night?)... eat sleep play... come to this world with nothing, and leave the world with nothing but laziness. If you could see it the other way, instead of waiting for opportunities, look for it. When you have it, treasure it and make full use of it. Give in your best and you will have one more thing to add in your achivement list. Isn't your life more colourful this way? ( If you say no, close this window. If you continue reading, that means you agree with me)  In this lifetime, it is inevitable that we face alot of troubles and problems... we have to make many important decisions and i admit it's very tiring. Stress, the word which seems harmless, but with meaning so powerful that it kill every soul that could not suppress it. One of the reason why i am writing is to release some stress i am facing... It's better to express out in the form of writing, verbally but not physically, than to keep everything to yourself inside your heart. It might explode(literally, ever heard of heart attack?) one day. So, whenever i have problem(which is alot?), i will try to type it out(hopefully i can). Some times i may also type some rubbish when i feel bored or what so ever.   Please don't stay tune and don't keep up to the latest updates( told you i am not writing for anyone to read except me).
