She finally got to me and sean at the end of the period, and when I went into her office she told me to go back to the auditorium. I went to chem it was alright, had no 3rd so I went back to the auditorium. This time I really didn't feel like not having a class so I waited at the door and was in the second group to go. I had to call my parents about whether I wanted to drop band or drop german. This is where my day started to fucking blow huge mother fucking ass. So I'm forced out of band and into fucking WELLNESS. WHAT - THE - FUCK. So then I get my new schedule and I have Algebra II and Chemistry 1st and 2nd period oh joy. I go to fourth which is study hall and had an alright time with Will and Connor. Go to lunch and have my money stolen by two different coke machines. By now I'm in "Fuck this lame ass school" mode. I then get to spend my whole lunch period wandering around because everyone wants to eat somewhere different, I guess my whole anti-social side had a part in me wanting to eat somewhere no one else was eating I think tomorrow I'm just going to "disappear" at lunch, I really don't feel like talking to alot of those people who don't understand me and won't back off when they can see I'm pissed. After lunch the rest of the day was fine had 2 hours in world studies then German and got on the bus to go home. Bus was fine got home talked to my mom for an hour about alot of things, school, drugs, my siblings ect. After dinner I went to apply at the library and was rejected so right now I'm sitting down here writing the stupid thing about how much my day sucked balls and how much this school year is going to suck. So umm yeah... today sucked, tomorrow's going to suck and chances are the day after that is going to suck.
