It took less than 45 minutes to get it all in the house and about 15 - 20 minutes to organize and lay out. Before she arrived, I cleaned most of the bathroom (didn't have time for every square inch), my bedroom, and did a lot of vacuuming and dusting. I also cleaned off my entire windowseat. "Ever since I was a little girl, I've always wanted a windowseat that I could work on." So now she has one.  I did everything I could to create as much space for her as possible so she wouldn't feel cramped for the three weeks until my parents move out. Its not a Marriot, but I can still see some of the floor and have access to all my stuff. Worked out pretty well in my opinion. She's already hooked up to the DSL router and her stuff is all over the bathroom. With all four of us under one roof, this is going to be an interesting three weeks!
