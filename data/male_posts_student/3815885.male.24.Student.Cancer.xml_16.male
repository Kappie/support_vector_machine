I work @ Jc Penney i'm really annoyed by the slutty clothes that we sell; it's like i work at a cheap imitation of Abercrombie or something - we even have the double meaning t shirts - what is this world coming to?  Things that weren't even dared to be joked about are now plain and simply right in our face.  And that's only in the store.  The lack of respect for one's body is the only thing that could bring someone to put on that skimpy swimsuit or whatnot - the days of decency and modesty i guess are gone.  These are my thoughts not yours, although i am interested if anyone has a different viewpoint leave me a comment or sign the guestbook.  Peace all -  God loves you
