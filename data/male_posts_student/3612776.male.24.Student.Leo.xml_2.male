My gosh, it's only a month away!!!  So exciting!  Take a peek at www.raeandmick.com and be sure to comment on how creative the website is!    A lot of things has been going on in my life...where shall I begin?  Hmm, I'll post one thing per day....instead of one BIG and LONG blog!    Summer school is such a drag!  I have been taking summer classes for the past 2-3 summers, and lemme tell ya something, it ain't no fun!  This summer, I'm enlightening myself by taking Political Legal Environment which is a MSSE requirement, and Shakespeare: History and Comedy which is an English requirement.  If you picked English as your content area, we gotta take 46 quarter hours of English classes.  So far, I've got 36 credits if you count Shakespeare.  36 credits!!!  I've got 10 more to go....and I'm dreading it.    Here's my dilemma:  This Fall is supposed and probably will be the toughest quarter we MSSEers will suffer.  We are required to take 16 credits of classes: Assessment, Foundations, Eng. Language Development, and Ed./Cultural Diversity.  Since I still have 10 credits of English to go, Mr. Evil Bateman says that Drama/Theater at NTID will count...so I'm taking History of Theater this Fall...that adds 3 credits to my load.  19 credits this Fall...isn't a very wise choice, I admit it...because we ALSO have to have a Graduate Assistantship as usual AND the smart students will be starting their Thesis, which includes me!  ALSO, I've gotta register for the LAST/ATS-W exams this fall, and gotta STUDY for them.  This Fall sounds pretty heavy, doesn't it?  SO...I wanna drop History of Theater.    BUT, that would mean...THREE English courses to take in the Spring PLUS our Thesis class (8 credits) AND Teaching Secondary Disabilities (4 credits).  Hmm...that would take me to 21 or so credits in the Spring--my LAST quarter, mind you!  So...that is my D I L E M M A !!!  I have absolutely NO CLUE what to do here.  I WANTED to take another MSSE class this summer (Independent Study)..but noooo, Evil Bateman said no, he was too "overwhelmed, because I already have 10 students and most of them aren't even supposed to take Indep. Study, but oops, I allowed them."  My ass!    So...I'm in a bind, and that's not good for my "illness".  GRRR, double GRRR!    Anyway, that's my post for the day!   Ta-Ta for now, Brooke
