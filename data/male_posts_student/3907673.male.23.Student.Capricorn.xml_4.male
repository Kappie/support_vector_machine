Boring day today, well, everyday's boring in school. who would like to go to lesson, especially when there's subjects which r damm dry, Like food knowledge, learning all sorts of food, the parts of an animals, etc... Somemore when the teacher is a boring one, who nv jokes.   Early in the morning was IT lesson, today learn abt powerpoint presentation, boring and stupid. Today also got back the proficency test result, and guess wat, out of the whole class, only 5 got 75% pass and i'm one of them.. hehe. U ppl must be thinking y i'm so happy, cause those who got 75% and above would be exempted from the IT lesson and then just need to sit for the end of term exam. But i think some of the lessons i would still sit in, as i'm not stable with my theory.   Followed by IT, was the boring food knowledge lesson, a 3 hr long lesson. Today in this class, learn abt all types of fish; white fish, oily fish, flat fish, rd fish, seawater fish, freshwater fish. sian... But wat to do, it's part of the things a CHEF need to know.   Today's kitchen demo was another theory lesson, as tomolo then the teacher would teach to make the sauces for salad hope that tomolo would be an interesting one. Think that's all for today. Till then. Cheers Thomas
