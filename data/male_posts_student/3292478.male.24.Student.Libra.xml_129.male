It has, however, continued to grow about an inch a day and shows no sign of stopping! The botanists at the  University of Connecticut  fear that instead of flowering the thing may just explode!!  The Uni guys have been keeping a  urlLink daily progress chart  to show its growth pictorially and in charts.  To give you some idea of how big this thing is getting here are some sequential photos from the last  month !!  June 8th -  16.5 inches tall . A mere baby in comparison to how big it's going to get!  urlLink     June 14th -  25.75 inches  tall  urlLink     June 17th -  33 inches  tall. Getting big so they employed a gimp to guard it!  urlLink     June 22nd -  45.75 inches  tall. For public safety they've now replaced the gimp with this dude!  urlLink     June 25th -  51.25 inches  tall. Now this chump gets in on the action! I swear that's Germany's ex manager Rudi Voller!!  urlLink     June 30th -  56 inches  tall. At this point it was thought that the plant was going to flower.  urlLink     However, as of 9.30pm GMT today, the thing is still holding out!!  urlLink     Keeping an eye on the  urlLink webcam  so I can hopefully get a screengrab just as it opens! Sad I know!  All pictures courtesy of The University of Connecticut.
