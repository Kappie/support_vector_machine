I think we should do something strange like nate, he presented on duct tape today although not in my class (he claims duct tape and "Duck" tape are the same thing, I disagree)  I can't wait for tomorow, going to the dells with alex and jemberg for al's b-day.  which reminds me of this morning in english jemberg was talking about it and sean's like "the dells? when?"  Evidently alex forgot to tell jem not to tell other people about it... so anyway sean was sorta pissed but i think he understood.  Hmmm i think i may just tell al and jemberg what i havent told... i'm getting tired of waiting for myself to tell someone.  oh yes you guys will be surprised at this one...  well, gnight
