Seriously, we'd save SO much money if we just got rid of them. You know, i think that it would still be cheaper if we put a 100$ a head bounty on people over 55. People don't "Suddenly" get old, it takes time (a lot of it), and then they leech off of everyone else. just the same as they don't "suddenly" become nuisances, it develops over time. One day i may be old, but i won't just wake up that way one day, i'll see it coming years off. stupid people don't realise that getting old takes time.  That being said, ashley you must take into account that some people DO have a sense of humor and not everything should be taken seriously. like i mean, we couldn't really grind up old people and feed them as is to the homeless, we'd need to produce mass ammounts of gravy to go with it because the meat would be so horribly dry. So if you're going to critisize me for something, keep in mind that i'm probably joking. -Matt
