ShuChoMouff: i keep listening to this one edited version of PVC IV(blue man) ShuChoMouff: with all the instruments removed besides the PVC instrument ShuChoMouff: this one part of the song ShuChoMouff: its amazing- it lasts like 3 seconds, but it's like its saying something Elf004: the PVC is talking ShuChoMouff: in a way ShuChoMouff: i think its message ShuChoMouff: was showing you how beautiful the world can sometimes be ShuChoMouff: even only for a moment ShuChoMouff: and you have to dig for it(i didnt have this revelation in the original unedited song)  EDIT: Nicholas's addition  "Elf004: and they show the beauty though PVC ShuChoMouff: well, that's a very blunt way to put it ShuChoMouff: you'd have to hear it Elf004: im sure i would  i wanted them to see my point question and answer, but i still dont get how beauty is expressed though PVC, but i think i get your point, just not the arrival at it... yeah"  Dood, while you were at my house, you shoulda told me to show you the thing I was talking about :-P
