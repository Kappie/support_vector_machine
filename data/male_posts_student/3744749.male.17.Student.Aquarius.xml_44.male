Mentioned a few minutes ago how lame it is to post the music you are listening to as you are posting. Hypocrisy...What would I do without you...  Cleaned room a few days ago like a competent person. Took about 7-8ish hours...Ugh. But hey, least it was been a trial in self restraint, a side of myself I haven't been showing much of lately. Not always a bad thing. Anyways, it's not entirely my fault.  Holy shit this ( urlLink http://http://gprime.net/images/sidewalkchalkguy/ ) is so rad! This ( urlLink http://www.kurtwenner.com/gallery.htm ) is his page.
