Well even though the first one may seem harmless, its not. If we lie to our friends about who were are, then its like your not really their true friend. We should not be afraid to tell the truth even if its embarrassing. Your friends will appreciate it. Lying to stay out of trouble, that's something that all of us have done before. I know i have done it many times and there are certain lies that i have told that im not proud off. I wish i didn't tell them and now i regret it. I won't mention what i did but to my friends that i hurt im sorry. Let me tell you why lying is very dangerous, firstly if your caught that would just put you in boiling water. Secondly if that lie is serious, you can hurt someone. Lying can do all sorts of things to the person you tell the lie too. Lying can lose a person's trust for you. Lying can make someone fell sad and hurt. Lying can make you feel bad by guilt. Lying can break up a relationship or a friendship. Lying is something that we all have and will continue to do. However even though we may lie, its better to tell the truth because if your caught, the friendship or relationship you thought you had could well be over. Depending on the lie, if its a small little white lie, im sure your friend will forgive you, but if its a lie that will hurt that person, its gonna take time and you have to convince that person that your still that person you use to be and gain his/her trust back because by lying to a person, your losing his/her trust. Trust is very important and it takes time to earn it back. I will try to tell the truth from now on even if the truth hurts, because no matter how much the truth hurts, lying is worse. I also wanna apologize to all those people that i have hurt by lying to them, im really sorry.
