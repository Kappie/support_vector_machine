Chapter is 8 is coming out...oh dear...haven`t paid much attention is class these days or the last few months i`ll bet. Last test on chapter 7, I got away with not studying and got a  66 . Not bad considering I didn`t think I could do that well in my book.    So mom and dad were still away outta town, so there was a nice spot in the driveway to sit..I made iced tea with my Crabtree  Evelyn teabags...I think i`ll use cheaper teabags next time..1 1/2 - 2 cups takes up the whole bag pretty much!I think it`s alot although it`s likely measured up as the same ammount in total if I put it in a mug :p . So I put my tea on the Vios. Haha..Then grabbed a deckchair and put it in a nice spot under the shade and stuff...Since it was so bright out there, I took my sunglasses and wore them while reading...and yes the words could be seen properly...Quite productive...was able to study from 4:30pm-6pm..then kacau Sarah :p..      Well after that I washed the Vios up and stuff...used the car shampoo and not detergent like I did on the old Wira when no one cared. Haha.I did it myself cause the cars like is not even 2 months old so didn`t want the maid to bust the car up or something..anyway had to move the car back a bit anyway and bring up the windows so better suited for me to do. Damn now got  lotsa  mosquito bites from all that outdoor-ness! Hehe!      Well mom and dad finaly came home at 9pm...thank god I didn`t follow them..they musta did so much work and stuff cause they brought back so much stuff til the car was full....heh...if that brought that ammount of stuff back and I was around, I wouldn`t have anywhere to sit. Well after unloading the car and stuff, got Nasi Goreng Ayam from Darul Ehsan for dinner...I had 1 1/2 packets worth of food...the food was nice though the portions were much less than usuall!   Then I started printing out stuff for people like the maths work for Cons and Farouq`s OET2...Then slept at around about 12am something.
