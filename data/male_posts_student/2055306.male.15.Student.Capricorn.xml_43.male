The deal is, I really need to stay humble and realize that I’m not as wise as I think. (If you guys could pray for that, that’d be great) So you know, talk about whatever you guys want. Manda was talking about how the world now SUCKS. That’d be good. Maybe God has layed something on your heart. Anyways, we just don’t need to talk about abortion. I know all of your stances on it. I know what you guys think. We all think the same way. It’d be pointless to talk about it. Hey look, maybe that was Satan trying to mess us up. Who knows. I know we could have wasted some time talking about that when we would have been talking about better stuff. So yeah. I’m sorry guys. Peace.
