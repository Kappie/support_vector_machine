Nose to the ground,  Beagle jowls puffing    Continuing forward on a scent. My body arches resembling the letter C.  Six year old struggling Black tail wagging   Back and forth, like a metronome keeping time,  the white tip looking  like it dipped into a can of paint.    From rustling stubby pruned bushes leapt a sharp black nose  and flowing mane of German shepard fur.   Two gigantic woofs   Ring out like cannon blasts. I hit the black pavement hard.   My view resembled a dropped camera.   Lines of broken asphalt are patched together with tar.  A doe like behind followed by a red leash was all I saw of my faithful companion,  seeking refuge anywhere but here.   My eyes rolled  Seeing snarled pointed canine teeth with slow moving drops of drool rolling down blackened jelly jowls.   The leash disappeared behind a garage.   The owner’s voice called “Sam” the dog relented. With skinned knees, I had no time to hear the apologies-  I now had to track the hunter.    Running through backyards filled with bric-a-brac  of sandboxes with shovels standing in frozen motion and yellow discarded wiffle bats,  Fearing Freckles had run towards the highway   I come upon a clearing. Bounding up grassy hills,   I cross a loose gravel path.   I see a squiggly line  looking like a sidewinder had wandered through.   But on closer inspection there were traces of four distinct padded puppy paws.   I call out her name seeing,  paws in the air, tail wagging  as she covered her scent  slowly rolling in fermenting apples.
