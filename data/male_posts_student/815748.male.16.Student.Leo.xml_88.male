I ended up keeping ten interviews, with: Matt KK, Will McLoughlin, Jacob Fleming, Mr. Stanley, Eli Raffeld, Loren, Jason Shen, Dan Shir, Matt Woolf, and Melody.  It's going pretty well, and it's pretty entertaining.  Nothing else really happened today, except I aced the English quiz and the history quest.  Ms. Heidlage said that whenever there are exchanges, she has the class ask the kid a bunch of questions about what will have happened, and then when he gets back, he answers them; but we took the quest so I was never asked.  I have somewhat gimongo assignments in history, English, and math, but they look manageable.  I have nothing else to say.  Go System of a Down.
