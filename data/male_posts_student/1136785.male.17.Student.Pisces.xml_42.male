Maybe it's because this whole not interacting with the girl because I'm not naive enough to believe in immediately just being friends means I no longer have anyone to hang out with, as she's always around our old group and she needs them more. Kind of sucks not having anything to do though. Least I'm getting my homework done.  Went to the Elizabethan Club's rare book collection yesterday, pretty cool stuff. First folio shakespeare, corrospondence of Queen Elizabeth, and my personal favorite - a first edition of Paradise Lost with an amazing gold and green original hard cover. It dates from 1667. Funny how Cromwell's Puritan poet Miltondoesn't get apublishinguntilthe Restoration. Good literature transcends politics in this case. That and the fact that puritans were cheap ashell.  Apparently yesterday was the twentieth anniversary of the only robot related fatality in the US. Some poor schmuck got pinned up against a pole by the back of an industrial robot and he wasn't freed until he had gone intocardiac arrest. Died in the hospital five days later. Interesting. I wonder if Aibo would kill me if it had the chance.  Never use  urlLink hyperboles  with Plastic Surgeons. They professionally reshape the human body; don't give them the chance to feed their god complex.
