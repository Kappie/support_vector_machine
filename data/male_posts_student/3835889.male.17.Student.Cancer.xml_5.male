The first year which i hav to spend my birthday alone without my friends...especially my close friends ( Hey guys dun be mistaken...the gurl i mentioned in my previous entry 'Weird Feelings' is my closest friend, not my gf!). I guess this year i wouldn't be getting any birthday presents from my friends in Spore. But anyway its alright 'cause its the thought that counts. Its the sincere well wishes that tells me my friends still care abt me...      I realli do not know what to write anymore, but i do hav something i want to say to Wanyi, my good friend: I am always there for you, whenever you need me, wherever i might be. What ever happens, i will always stand by your side. In life, there will be ups and downs, and its up to you to overcome it. I might be there for you, but all i can do is to give you advise, and the rest is up to you. Hmm i guess i'm getting too emotional with her...Lolxz emotional as in close friendship! Anyway gtg hav dinner right now, then watch WWE raw life...
