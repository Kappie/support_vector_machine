Anyway It went fine I was told I had a odd heart beat that went ta dum ta dum ta dum ta (whistle) dum. But he said it normal for adolescents. So I'm alright. Anyway I need to get a blood test tomorrow ad I'll be fine. I went to Michaels house today (both actually) and here I'm, typing. I post my story it's forty pages. And well i guess my blogger lookers can see it. I'll post it in four sections. 10 pages each just to leave you wanting more. (well it's not great but I think it's o.k) anyway my highlight of my dayI got an Email from Tarah. I'll make sure to keep in touch. with her.     !Happy Birthday Kevin!
