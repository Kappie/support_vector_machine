The Taste of the Danforth is a street festival, where traffic is cut off over a number of blocks, and for the weekend, pedestrians can traverse along the street sampling a bevy of food from various restaurants, mostly Greek, since the Danforth is a Greek area.  Although I've lived in Toronto all my life, I hadn't ever gone to the festival until this year, mostly because it was yet another event that, as a Toronto-native, I took for granted.  To be honest, it wasn't fantastic, but it was worth going to, if only because the food was good and cheap, and there were a number of companies giving out freebies.  I suspect that it will become more lively as the weekend progresses, as we arrived around 6 PM, when the festival was scheduled to begin.    I didn't take pictures, since there really wasn't anything very unique to take pictures of.  Another event I plan to take part in is the annual  urlLink C.N. Tower Climb .  A friend who has participated in the past was able to finish his climb in approximately 15 minutes, a period that I can't seem to reconcile with the height of the structure.  I wonder how I will fare?  I look forward to the challenge of it, but also the experience, and the ability to say that "I've done it" that will accompany it.  At the end of this month, Star Trek: The Next Generation's  urlLink  Patrick Stewart  is coming to Toronto for the  urlLink Canadian National Science Fiction Expo .  I'd really like to listen to the man speak, but the ticket costs $120 Canadian, and that's not including the price of the ticket ot actually get into the convention.
