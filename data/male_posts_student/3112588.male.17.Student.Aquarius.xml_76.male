LoL! she posted like 3 times, and then thats it...but we're busy ppl--so cut us some slack, kk? soooo yeah, did lots of chores today, rented some movies--and ate really really really bad. but oh well! i dont really care. not planning on doing much tonight. for some reason, im just feeling like its friday...probably b/c yesterday (friday) didnt feel like much of a friday to me, but none the less, i had tons of fun shoppin' with suzy and stuff. tomorrow is sunday once again, and then a week from then--like 3 ppl are leaving for camp (vanessa, suzy, AND ariel)...you guys have mucho fun! if you have to work in the kitchen, try not to do the "dish machine" more than 5 times a week--trust me, your hands will be peeling from all the steam (gross)! LoL! reminds me when rachel, alex, gina, jeremy, jesse, and myself would all try and stack the cups all the way up to the cieling and balance them into the kitchen!! heh--rachel beat all of us though...she got like 89 or something. i only got like 76...camp is definitely a place where you form lots of memories, and for some ppl--even form long lasting friendships that will last you a lifetime. even though at times you feel like you want to burn the whole camp down, you'll be happy that you went...you'll be ADDICTED, and want to go back like every year!! ill be up to visit you both though--suzy and ariel--so no worries there! we'll have to hit up Capitola Mall, the beach, and go have dinner at Shadowbrooke! hey, do you know what they told me though?!?! they shut down Margaritaville!!! dude, i hecka wanted to go back there...but we can go dancing on the beach in Capitola again, kk? that was SO much fun! then myself, alex, jesse, and daniel all went to go shopping in the little shops in the city--and we got ice cream at that HECKA good little "hole in the wall", member guys? man...good times! well, anywayz...enough about how good Koinonia is! i dont know what im going to do this week. since i got my cell back, ive been having to call like everyone to tell them that im sorry that they've been neglected!! its a tradgedy i tell you--but they'll live! stacy, we've hecka gotta go to half moon bay this week for a little while, ok? good stuff guys! call me, kk? byebye
