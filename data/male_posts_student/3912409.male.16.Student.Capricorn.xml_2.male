I guess I forgot to go to my orthadontist thing this morning, which means that I have to go next thursday at 9:00. I was supposed to do the dishes and fold some laundry before I left for tennis... but I didn't :p, so I had to do the dishes a couple hours ago and I still haven't folded the laundry. Ok, so at the moment me and Cookie are listening to the Baby Baluga song together. After I got home I didn't really do much, I ate some snacks and stuff. O yeah, and I also ate a popsicle! lol after that I had some craisins. Eventually me and BJ started to play some Crackwarz and he made me join his little clan type thingy.... so yeah.... other then that I've mainly just been talking to Cookie all day.
