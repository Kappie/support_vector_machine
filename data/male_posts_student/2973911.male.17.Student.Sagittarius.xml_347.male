Well, I've already detained "alone" and through the game group of Vampire the Eternal struggle (a card game, like Magic), I've become more inclined to the social.  Somewhat.  I don't know about you people, but the only way to feel less alone is get other nearby friends and abuse them.  Oh,  hahaha.  By the way, I just had a bad dream.  Fergit about those demons and monsters.  My dream is a conspiracy.  Well, I don't understand it exactly.  And two guy blow jobbing a man while others ignore them, as if it is more natural than water.  I don't understand it exactly, but they are on to me!!!
