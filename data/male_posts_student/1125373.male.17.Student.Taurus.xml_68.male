I had 3 mini solos but they didnt really matter. That basically sucked up my friday night and saturday. However, saturday's lunch was MEGA interesting. I sat between the two kevins and I was caught in the middle of the pick-on-siru-and-siru-throws-food-at-kevins-fight. It was kinda funny and then the boys (Colin and kevins) had a rootbeer chugging contest (we were at A). So we performed and whatnot. After i changed out of that condemned trashbag and hung out for a while in the instrument room with Kevin(f)...and no Jacky...its not what you think :-P!!  Sunday was Kevin Clark's B-day...big 1-8. I went over to his house and others came over too. We played this game called dirty minds...they kept making me read the clues. Then we went bowling. This is where it gets interesting. We get there and get our lane and Amanda and Leah go get bowling balls. Well this weird (ugly) guy calls them over and asks for their names, Leah tells him her name. But then he asks for a #, but she gives him a fake one. The rest of the time we were there...the guy kept staring over at us. We finally decided to come up with a plan just in case. However the creepy guy leaves and all is well.   Monday....did nothing really.   Today. GAH! Stupid STATS! Forgot i had a test today....EEK! lol. Oh well...didnt do too hot on my history mag...but thats ok i really dont care...  well  more later  AmEs
