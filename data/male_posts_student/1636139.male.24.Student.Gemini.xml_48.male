The official purpose of the lunch meeting was to discuss the potential for a promising new application for the technology we've been working on. Of course, as is wont to happen when a bunch of long-time computer programmers (and one curious intern) get together informally, there was also much narration of computery anecdotes. The food was good but the stories blew them away  8-)
  
...and - oh yeah -  good riddance to the Tories  :->
