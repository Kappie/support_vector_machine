I need to get some AIM buddies.....all my ones from home dont get onlin till late @ night. Which is a pain in the ass sometimes. Wish I could get a butterfly knife they look much better....:)  Anyway...Im gonna go to dublin town center tomorrow and maybe get a cell phone and digi cam so that might be good.  I hope my bro doesnt go....hes too annoying....all he does is make up excuses and whine over who gets the front seat(despite me having longer legs). He fights and bickers with me over crap things....it pisses me off so much! Argh.!  I downloaded Farenheight 9/11 the other day which michael moore gave explicit permision to do so, it was so great....I learned so much more about bush. 42% of the time during 2001 he was on vacation. When he learned of the Terrorist Attacks he stood there with a book for over 10 mins not doing anything....it was so funny......  Personally I am glad the 9/11 Attacks happened...it made people realize that there are other cultures out there and that we have enemies and that we are not totally safe....  but....it did cause the US economy to crash and gave bush an excuse to attack iraw which BTW will get him all the votes from Racists....    and...fuck......just now I have some of my best friends @ home pissed @ me cuz I was trying to help....I cant give details for OBVIOUS reasons....just what I need...my only links with home pissed at me...  look at this chat line..   well listen u fucker if u try and fix anything else i wont ever talk to u again       sure blame me fuckin wonderful....  Now im getting blamed for rumours spreading etc...  ergh  im 5000 miles away and getting fucked over in the ass........  Oh well  Till later times  -Wes/Prometheus
