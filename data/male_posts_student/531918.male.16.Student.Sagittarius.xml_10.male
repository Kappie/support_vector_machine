I could go into how the drums and bass are relatively tame while Slash is left to dominate over them. I could go into how "Dirty Little Thing" is almost a mirror image of "Sucker Train Blues", albeit not as good. But I'm not.  I'll just say this: the CD is, at best, average, unoriginal, and trite. It's still semi-fun to listen to, though.  Rating: 3/5
