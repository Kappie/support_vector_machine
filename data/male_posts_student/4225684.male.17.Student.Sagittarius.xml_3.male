But what is actually necessary and what is just due to plain old selfish desire. Have we ever stopped to think about it?       I need that!! I want that!! Buy it for me!! Get it for me!! Sound familiar? Many a times i have been guilty of selfish desire, but at that moment of time, i don't really notice it myself. My mother always tells me that she will one day hire a cameraman to follow me around and video record every single thing i say and do. She says that i will definitely not even recognize myself if i were to watch the video.       Personally, i hate to agree with that but i would think its true. Sometimes i know myself that i am unreasonable and demanding but i will deny all such accusations at that point of time. Its only after the whole matter has passed on when i will actually realize and think about my actions and how selfish they were. Necessary? Most of the time no... Most of the time my actions were purely of selfish desire.. Afterall we humans by nature are selfish people.      What is this strange feeling called desire? Why do we desire? Desire is more then just simple want, its somewhat of a craving, of a need... We suffer from desire just like how drug addicts suffer without their drugs... Can we ever learn to break free from these bonds and chains called desire binding us to this material plane? Or will we forever be slaves to materialism and forever feed the great fuel of desire and let it grow into a great big blaze.      "Her smiles ever so melting, makes all in place.   Her touch ever so haunting, a wind's caress could never replace.   Her laughter, angels chanter, reminds me of heaven.   Oh how i thank god with all my heart, for depriving heaven of her grace."
