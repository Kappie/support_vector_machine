To tell you the truth, I think I should start here. Now. I like  Her , I like  Her  a lot and I don't know what to do about it. I cant ask  Her  for I don't know if she likes me, or if she still does. I don't know what to do. I remember the first time we kissed. So surreal in my mind as though I could go back to that day when the snow fell, when it was "snowing in the car." My eyes were on her from the moment she walked out of the house. The roads were starting to get bad and if we didn't leave then, we wouldn't have gone. If you would have told me at that time that something was going to happen between  Her  and I, I would've laughed in your face. The plan was to make cookies, although it never happened we still had fun. We found a way to entertain ourselves with a little soccerball in a "hot potato" esque game. Somehow we ended up on the futon mattress on the floor. all lying there creating small talk and enjoying each others company. The other two were talking amongst themselves as She and I talked. At first it was awkward, for talking to someone new was weird in itself. The Hair-tie....A segway to holding hands. But the thing I remember most about that was not the kiss itself, but the way she looked into my eyes, the way she traced the outline of my jaw with her fingers and the moment before the kiss, which I believe is greater than the kiss. I know you are going to read this and I know what you are thinking, this isn't a ploy to get you back. I just want you to know how I feel. How I felt. I'll be back.
