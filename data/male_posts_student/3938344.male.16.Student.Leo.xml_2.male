At least I don't have to do jack shit to get $6 an hour) when I heard something that made my stupid detector start flipping a shit even from the 3 second preview of the story.  And it was indeed going absolutely crazy; the preview stated something about temporarily bringing back slavery to promote racial equality.  But that isn't even the worst part...  They weren't kidding about slavery...except they've switched it up a little this time.  Now black people (I'm not going to use the long, hyphenated politically correct name because political correctness is just another form of oppression) are going to walk in a parade in Annapolis, holding chained up -- you guessed it -- white people.  Now, if you can't think of something wrong with this, you're missing the point.  Just walk away from your computer -- or better yet, unplug your computer, put it back in the box, and return it, because you are far too stupid to be eligible to use a computer.  If you can, then get a load of this: it is a BRITISH group who is organizing this.  Yes, that's right -- the British, who ran rough-shod over anyone they conquered, are going to lecture us on racial equality.  I feel honored.    But the real kicker here?  This isn't just a group of crazy people involved in this.  The local government has essentially written a blank check paying for this load of crap.  A blank check paid for with our hard-earned tax dollars.  Now, I have seen 95%, solid bullshit and I have seen THIS.  The stupidest idea ever, which is most likely just going to inflame racial hatred rather than quell it,  which is run by a British corporation, is going to be funded by the government.  Someone needs to die, and quickly.  Decisions this crappy don't just happen once by a person.    This shit is pathetic.  I have nothing more to say about this giant load of stupid.  The post will end.  Here.  Now.
