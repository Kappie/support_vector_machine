People paid just as little attention to me afterwards as they did before. Except my friends. Who are all like, "Yea?". Meh.  I spend far too much of my time wishing so-and-so was gay. Hell, I think I can tell better than they can. I can think of at least 10 people who I should just spreads rumors about to get it started. Then when they're out I can sleep with them, and never speak to them again.  I mean, I have to listen to people I hang out with complain that it's been too long since they've had sex. At least there are people of your sexual orientation that exist around you! Let's see how long it's been since Eric got laid. Umm....forever and a half! Buuyaka!  Don't get me wrong. I'm not all about sex with no love. I just don't associate them very well. But when Eric finally gets the love he desires(*wink wink* maybe?) I could totally dig that monogamy thing. Screw college, I want sex now! I feel deprived of good times.   No, Scotty doesn't count. I'm not sure why. But for purposes of this post at the time, he largely didn't.
