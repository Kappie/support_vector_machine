When tears fall and hit my face.  Don't let me be put underground. Stay with me. Kiss me one last time. White lights are in my eyes. But then I see you.  Never leave me motionless. Never breath for me. I will always be. Alive for you.  Stand beside my side. You pushing my the hair out of my eyes. You look more beautiful then ever.  Living lives like it comes for free. My love. Stay with me forver days.
