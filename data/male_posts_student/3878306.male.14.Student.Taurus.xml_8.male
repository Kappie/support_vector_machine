First we were riding relaxing and I’m looking to the right and there is these two white guys listing to Lloyd Banks “Fire” and they’re really into it. Moving there body with it but it was so funny because they act so ghetto but in such an “well you live in your mother’s house and have two cars but still” ghetto way. It’s hard to explain let’s just say anyone else would not do that like them. I start to stare and then move my body down and start laughing. They get pissed and stop doing it. Second we were almost there and Ivan’s talking about his job. Ivan does something do to with moving boxes and organizing and stocking I’m not exactly sure anyway he works with inmates. Well not with inmates but at the end what he piles and moves goes to inmates. And then the radio goes “locked up” we all start laughing. Anyway we get there and we walk a bit. The place is about 3.5 miles long one way. We walk to some point and then Ivan goes by himself and runs in both directions, 7 miles or more. Sara and me go to subway, which is right there, and order sandwiches. Then we take a quick seven eleven grab and get drinks. We hang around the car but every time we were next to the car someone would ask for parking. So we sat in a bench. Sara had to pee and right and that moment Ivan just comes back. We go get tickets to et in the beach. And we chill for a while and eat. There were a lot of condo’s and nice houses. Anyway later we decide to go in the water. It was really wavy. Sara couldn’t go in because well you know why. She’s pregnant. (Oh yeah that’s the pregnant woman from the title duh) anyway Ivan and me got in. the wave’s were so much fun. It would come and we would have to swim away fast it was great. Sometimes we just let it hit us but sometimes they were so big you had to run. After we went back and talked relaxed got tanned and we were deciding what to do but we just decided to go back because it started to rain. I have to admit this was really fun and would die to do it again, even just the same thing all over. (Well I’d prefer just going again) Sara wants to name the baby Nathaniel if it’s a boy and Ivana if it’s a girl. They don’t exactly know if it is a girl or boy. I really don’t mind what the baby is but Sara said that Elaine had a boy then a girl and so did Ariel. This trend might just happen again. Crappy thing though is that Nathaniel or Ivan is going to be young compare to the rest but the baby always get the most love so its not that bad. I’m really happy for the grandkids though because they have 5 first cousins and if they have another one and Iseli have one that’s 7 first cousins. That would be so cool. I have two first cousins. The L’s Leytta and Lana. Bad thing though is that I’m so old compare to them. Leytta is 6 and Lana 6 months but that’s not so bad you get to have small baby cousins. Well when we went back to the house we watched some TV and my godmother called and it she said she was going to take me home in the morning and had to be there by tonight. I left Ivan’s house kind of sad that we didn’t spend more time with him and Sara but I guess it was back to my world. Well I got there I learned we were leaving tonight just because of traffic. Nikki, Her dad and my godmother took me home. We bought pizza on the way back. I noticed something though. When I was in Ivan’s house he said that in his mom’s house that there was too much greasy food. And my godmother said that they don’t eat much. I’m sorry I don’t know who’s side I’m on here because my godmother does it wrong but Ivan eats much healthier. O.K I got Ivan’s side. When I got home I said hello to my room. My dad left me some shoes. There is Nike Tennis with deep green color on the side. Thanks Dad. My mom had finished her butterfly puzzle, which it’s oddly shaped like a butterfly. I’m happy to be home.
