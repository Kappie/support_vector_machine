But... she's safe thank GOD!=) Yup, things are still going really well with Mandy. I am loving it! I see her practically every day and on the days I don't we speak on the phone. We have the odd argument but never anything too serious. She stayed last Tuesday and broughtover a big-ass bottle of Budweiserand it was a bit of a nice mixture. Then on Wednesday I spent the day drinking in Piccadilly with my friend Gav. I think I drink more and more every week! Thursday night I went to Jilly's again and got completely fucked - probably the worst I have been. EVER. I ended up starting on a car because I was angry about something... unaware there were 2 beefy black dudes in it. They got out and started punching me in the head. Ouchy. But oh well, no permanent injuries. I cried a lot that night too over the most retarded stuff, which is why I am limiting my spending money in Jilly's to just Â£6.00-8.00. That way I know I won't drink too much. Then on Friday we went to my friend Adam's 'gathering' - didn't drink too much there... around 8 bottles of alcopops. There was a really nice bonfire in the back too and some very nice words were said between Mandy and myself. Then I stayed over at Mandy'son Saturday night - ya see I can't get enough of her, even after almost 3 months! Wooooo! T'is my mums 50th tomorrow! My dad has a trip to New York arranged for her, that he has been planning for over a year. I know she will enjoy it. Still haven't got a clue what to get her - shall think about that when she gets home. Speaking of birthday's, it's mine on the 19th! WOOOOOO! Love you Mandy =) xx
