It's just really annoying sometimes, especially when you get in trouble for your hair being to long in the first 5 minutes you're there. 1) My hair is not to long. 2) Can I at least say hey to one person before i get in trouble? 3) I'm not going to cut it anyway, so why waste your breath? People these days, they just don't understand. Well i don't really have anything else to write. I'm looking forward to tonight and this weekend. Life is so much easier when u can drive. Peace out... War in!
