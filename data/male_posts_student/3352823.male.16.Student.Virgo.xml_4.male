FOX anyone?) television known to man. It's sweeps. May Sweeps. Completely different to February Sweeps for the sing fact that this time... It's personal. I have been looking forward to a few VERY importan season finales, like Survivor, 25, The OC, Friends, Will  Grace and... Umm... American Idol (which ends tonight...) Oh! And Alias! That was the GREATEST finale I've ever seen. Period!   School's winding down.. Then I have (Woah.. Deja vuu... Vuu.) tonnes of time off. Whee. Job searching. Great. Corn. Huzzah! And... Other things? Heh.  S'all for now.
