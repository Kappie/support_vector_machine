I think I'll go watch a movie.. Jerry Maguire, Perhaps. Haven't seen that for a while. Boy, Pizza Hut sure makes some damn good pizza. This week, starting Tuesday, I got 85 extra credit in world affairs for not wearing any sweat shop made clothes (at least ones made by nike, gap, guess, old navy, levis, and some others).. such an easy task for a whole letter grade(almost) of extra credit.. wow.. life is good.  anyways.. I have a funny picture:
