My brothers and I made him some hamburgers, hot links, and cake, but by the time we had finished cooking, I wasn't even hungry. Anyway, we have yet to eat the cake, so I am waiting to free up some room for that. My brother got some kind of weird Sponge Bob Square Pants ice cream to go with it.   I guess we still have to get my dad a present of some sort, but we were a little short on ideas when we were shopping for him. What do dads like for presents? My dad doesn't seem to sit down and watch movies too often, so DVD's are out. That's about all I can think of. I'll be in trouble when Father's Day pops up in a couple weeks.  By the way, today is also  urlLink Natalie Portman 's birthday. Not so long ago, I was somewhat smitten with her. I still want to see her in her upcoming movie  Garden State  this summer, but Nate seems to think that it will suck.
