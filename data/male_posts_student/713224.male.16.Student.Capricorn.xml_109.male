Alot of "Sienfeld-like" moments, probably because Larry, the main writer, producer, and star of the show was the head creator of sienfeld. This is more of a middle-age suburban Sienfeld, which isn't quite as funny, but it makes for new plots, and more awkward situations. All inn all, this new version of sienfeld deserves:    ****  *
