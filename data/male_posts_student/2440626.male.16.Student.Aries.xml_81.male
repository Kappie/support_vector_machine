I am jealous that she is in the Virgin Islands.  I have been practicing Briscola so I can beat her when she gets back.    Upcoming movies I am looking forward to:  Anchorman, Ocean's 12, A Series of Unfortunate Events, The Bourne Supremacy.   You know. I haven't told anyone this story yet, but I feel the need to tell it now.  When I was in Los Angeles, Rafaela and Maira took me to Olvera Street in downtown LA.  Now, Olvera Street is the little cobblestone street that is mainly Mexican influenced.  Anyway, while we were there, we went to the house that is the supposed to be the oldest house in LA.  As we walked around the casa, we noticed little signs that explained the room that you were currently in.  In the "Family Room," there was one of those signs.  Now here is the irony.  The words "The Family Room" on the sign was in the same font as the words "Family Matters" on the opening credits of the show "Family Matters."  Maira pointed it out and I was like, "Wow, it really is the same font."
