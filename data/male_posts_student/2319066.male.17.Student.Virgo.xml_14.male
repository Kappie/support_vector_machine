It is so cool to be able to see how much they have really improved from the first day.  It's crazy.  Oh well, at least freestyle will start next week.  That will be fun.  My day was normal, except that it seemed to last forever.  I almost fell asleep in all of my classes today, oh well.  That's all for now.  See ya.
