Well I've been really working hard on my drawing lately. I did two last week that I'm really happy with. Monday I went iceskating with most of the people reading this, ha ha lol. That was so much fun!  We all gotta do something like that again sometime. Let's see afterwards my family and I spent the rest of the day with the Sanchezs. We had alot of fun hangin' out at their house and that evening we went and watched Elizabeth's hockey practice. It was tons of fun, ha ha and Sarah gave me a violin lesson, ha ha thanx Sarah. Well I think that's all I'm going to write right now I'm kinda tired. So farewell for now!  Hyah!
