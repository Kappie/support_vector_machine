There were spiders everywhere, so there was a lot of screaming going on with 8 girls, most of which were screaming at some point.  Laura was freaking out the most.  Laura and Kristyn's boat musta been crooked, cause they kept runnin into things.  It was a lota fun cause me and mari kept trying to race canoes with jessie, dharini, and sarah.  I don't know that anyone ever really won; we just stopped cause we got tired.  The water was really cold, but it kinda felt good after canoeing in the sun for a while.  Nobody completely flipped their boat, but we all came close at some point.  We need to go again sometime.  Probably next year cause it's not cheap.  I think it ended up being about $120 or somethin like that for 3 canoes and 1 kayak.
