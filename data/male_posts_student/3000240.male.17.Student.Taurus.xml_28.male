Also it will (although unlike what my Dad thinks, if I take the overtime at work) the opportunity to work quite a bit towards my exams, which are only a few weeks away. Judging from my profiling last week, I need to work my ass of to get the c's I really need. Oh well, I must be getting on with this work with some Psychology, so ciao for now. xBuBzx
