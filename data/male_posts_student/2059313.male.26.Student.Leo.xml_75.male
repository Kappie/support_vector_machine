You know how sometimes you meet people, and it's just really neat because it's something new, and so after a little while, you and the people don't click any more... well, it doesn't seem to be letting up at church.  The people there are genuine and kind and loving.... thank You God, for keeping two of my good friends on my back to get involved with this place.  You've answered a really big prayer for me.  Now... let's talk about that girl that You want for me.  Where is she? Huh?  I'm here for Your glory, but it would make it easier to give You my whole being, if I had the other half of me.  As I am... I am incomplete, without You and without her.  Lead me to her.  Show her to me, God.
