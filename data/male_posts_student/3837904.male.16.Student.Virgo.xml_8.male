I guess my trying to get back together into this certain chapter is going smoothly. English lesson turned out well. Such great personal experience shared by Mrs Manmohan, gives me various mind-views of both myself and corey. I finally realise that time is the most important subject of all time. It's of great treasurence and patience is needed no matter how bad the situation gets. Supposing I'd then just let things cool off and carry on with life. Someday sooner after the situation settles in calmness, then maybe things would be realise and considered. Had a great long walk with Rachael after slacking with Huilin and Suman. Had really open mindsets of the various situation. Thanking Rachael for atleast believeing in corey and getting things back together could be uphold. Slacking sensation seems to be very crazy. With people like Rachael and Huilin, well things can get worst criticising both parties. It was great fun by the way.
