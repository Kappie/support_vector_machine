But like I told Matt, I enjoy typing a lot more than I like writing. I remember back in Middle School, EVERYONE who was anyone had an online journal. I still don't really get why people write about their secret issues like they would in a private journal/diary online, on a PUBLIC journal thing. Doesn't really make sense to me, but hey...im doing it aren't I? Anyway...I remember I had my online journal till the middle of 9th grade, then after two incidents I decided it wasn't worth it anymore. The first one occurred at the end of my 8th grade year with one of my close friends at the time, Teresa (she moved away, up to West Palm Beach). She obviously had an online journal as well and was actually one of the people that talked me into starting one. Well, to sum up Teresa, she was never the cool cheerleader that everybody liked or even the nerdy art student who everybody knew but pretended not to. She was apart of our little "click" at school that everyone seemed to stay away from. And of course, people always made fun of us for the way we dressed and the music we listened to. It was so immature, but I guess that's middle school. Its funny cause I look back on it now and I think to myself...God damn was I a fat little idiot. And I see my sister going through the same fazes and changes that I did in/at her grade/age (wow, that's confusing to look at). Anyway, so we were all made fun of a lot and whatever. So Teresa writes about it in her online journal. And I think this was all about one or two years after the Columbine incident. And she's writing in her journal that she's gonna get these kids back before the end of the year and blah blah blah. But of course, all of us know she means just like make fun of them behind their backs because that's Teresa. She doesn't have the balls to walk up to one of them and hit them in the face. Or for that fact, bring a gun to school and shoot everybody up. So somehow somebody in the school reads that entry and decides to turn it in to the School board. And of course my journal has a direct link to hers and vice versa and I wrote stuff like that too in mine, so im not the little innocent angel either here. Well, we are both brought down to the office and blah blah shit happens. They talked to us about the "seriousness" of this situation and all that other garbage, whatever. In the long haul, Teresa gets expelled and I get suspended, for like a day and then my dad goes down there and raises hell. And well, that's the reason Teresa moves up to West Palm. I feel kind of bad sometimes cause we promised we wouldn't lose touch and I guess we really haven't, but we aren't nearly as close as we once were. I think that might have to do with the fact that she's doing drugs and drinking now, but whatever. Well, that pretty much sums up the first incident. The 2nd one happened with my first girlfriend. The summer right after 8th grade, I meet this incredibly hot girl in my neighborhood through my friend at the time, Johnny, who is actually her brother...go figure. She was such a nice person to me, knowing that I had never had any past experience with girls or anything. This was the girl I lost my virginity to...the sick part was, another girl was involved. That was the one weird thing about Jennifer, is that she was bi-sexual. She had this friend who lived down the street named Megan who was such a little whore and she was only 14. I think I was like just turning 15, so I guess im no better than she was. And Megan would come over and just hit on me non stop...I don't understand why, I was so fat and stupid then...still am, but...a little better. So anyway, we dated for about 3 months and then she broke up with me for some bogus reason, I forget why. I was completely devastated by this too, being my first girlfriend and all AND the girl I lost my virginity to, I was pretty fucked up by it all, so anyway. I knew the real reason behind it. It was because she wanted to date other people cause she was a whore. So yeah, I wrote about it in my online journal. And I called her a whore in it and blah blah and how we had sex in a threesome with another chick blah blah. And im guessing she knew what the address of my online journal was cause she showed her new boyfriend at the time who was this 6ft tall, in shape, knew martial arts, black guy. Yeah, bad news for me written all over that description. Well, I used to ride the bus home back then, cause I didn't have a car and Freddy hadn't moved down yet so I couldn't ride with him. So, one day I get off the bus and he for some reason rode our bus that day. Well, I have my headphones on and im walking home, and this guy decides he wants to fuck with me. He gets in my face and I take my headphones off. This dude doesn't say anything, he just hands me this piece of paper, which I find out later is my diary entry. And when I look down at the paper I look up right after and he fucking hits me in the face. He fucking sucker punches right in the face. Me, never being in a real fight before (only instances with which I've punched a kid out and held one up against a locker with one arm, I had never actually been in a fight with another kid swinging at me) fell to the ground like a ton of bricks. Woke up, walked home with a swollen face and that was that. I never saw the kid in school again though. I wasn't sure if he transferred or whatever...and Jennifer ended up moving so yeah. Those are my two reasons for not having an online journal anymore. Wow...I ended up writing a lot more than I had intended to. Well anyway, till next time...
