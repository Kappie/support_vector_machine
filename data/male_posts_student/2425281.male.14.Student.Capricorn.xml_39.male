Geo was better than expected. I seriously thought that i was going to fail that one, but i tied with Ben which must be a good thing. My history result wasn't as good as expected so i guess i probably shouldn't have spent the last twenty minutes of the test sleeping. I know i have failed jap but it's not like jap is important (hope Yi Long is not reading this). Tried to decided what to do during Queen's b'day and haven't managed to organize anything yet. It was down to Adro's house, JT's house or a movie. Stupid Andy won't tell me what majong and Jason said something like "what do you mean you don't know what it means" (in shang of course). Came 27th in the grade for maths so i end this blog on a happy note. g'nite pplz
