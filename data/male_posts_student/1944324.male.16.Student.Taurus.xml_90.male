But now, it's just like...What was I thinking??   So anyway.  Enough about that.  I don't really know why I'm writing in here; there isn't really that much to write about.  Cept I've got a little crush on a friend and I can't like him because I don't want to screw up our friendship.  How much does that suck?  lol cuz I think it sucks mucho.  Anyways...au revoir!  All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.
