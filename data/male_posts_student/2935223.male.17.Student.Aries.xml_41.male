Conrad feels that he is a horrible person, and I can't help but feel to blame for it...even though it's not DIRECTLY my fault....god I feel bad  PLUS at the moment I'm bein' told that I'm stupid for leaving the DDR party, when really, I woulda stayed, but it didn't really seem as if anyone was especially keen on me staying......why do I have such low self-esteem.  Then I see that Keli is totally, for no better way to say it, freakin' out, because she doesn't think that I actually care about her, when in reality, I TOTALLY like her, and I wish she would know that, and now she just gave me her phone number....YAY!  So, it seems I'm more wanted that I think I am, considering that Tascha* just said that she would have wanted me to stay at tht DDR party, I mean sure, she IS going out with my bestfriend, but, even he didn't seem to enthusiastic about me staying. *possibly one of the last people on the face of the Earth to say that she wanted me to stay at a party  Ya, so, I'm kinda happy right now, but I'm also kinda sad...oh well...I'll just talk to Keli sum more, she cheers me up.  YAY! Peace  Spense
