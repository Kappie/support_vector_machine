If you have never checked out  urlLink Goats  you should really give it a look. The artist has skill, and many of the comics have some political undercurrent. My personal favorite, so far, is the "Jesus Loves Dick" [Cheny] cartoon.  We'll be doing a movie LAN party tomorrow, I'll update you as this movie progresses. A movie webpage is in the works, showing off our content. We've made 3 major movies and lots of shorts from movie footage. This movie will probably be "filmed" across two to three sessions. I should probably explain to you what we do: We assemble everybody at my house or place of work. I then hook my USB Video Capture Device up to my computer and take footage from a few different computers. I save all these clips and then hack them together using Windows Movie Maker, although I plan on buying some better software soon. I'm not sure between Pinnacle Studio 8 or Ulead Video Studio. I think for the capture this time, I will run  urlLink FRAPS  on my computer and another. Then, I will be able to do the camera shots and I can get two different angles on a scene.  Right now, I'm going to bed as I'll have a busy day tomorrow.
