The second reason is that I'm in the south of France right now on holidays and I only have a dialup connection down here which is really a bore. That's why I only check out my emails every now and then and get the latest news on FOX's and CNN's websites. Yeah, no cable here. I'm missing lots of things happening including DNC coverage which is not shown on France's broadcast networks obviously. I'll be back in the North of France on July 31st, that's the date I'll blog again. Until then, don't forget about this blog.
