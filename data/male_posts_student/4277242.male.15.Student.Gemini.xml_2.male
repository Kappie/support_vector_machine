It has been a long time since the last time I received one in June, and that one's made up of cheap plastic that dribbles in my hands!      I'm supposed to slack today. It's such a pity (after pride) that I have been put in charge of something, which needs to be done long ago, last week. When the authorities in school discovered that the deadline loomed close, pressure travelled in transverse waves from top-dog to unter-dog.      Hey yon fellow adolescent, slacking is not enough: enjoy slacking!
