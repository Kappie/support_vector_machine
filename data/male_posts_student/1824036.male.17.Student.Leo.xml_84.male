I am just suiting Varsity, whether or not I will play that Is another story. I dont think that I will play a whole lot this year (unless of course we are way ahead...or way way  way  behind) I hope that I letter this year. But that would involve playing in more than half the games...and I dont think that that will come true. Today we play Eagle Grove. And last time we played here (at Humboldt (my school)) they ended up beating us 49-0 or something like that :S...I hope either they are worse or that we are better.  Our intensity level is  WAY  higher this year than last year. Everyone that is out there wants to play. Except for a few other sophomores in my class that are just a bunch of whiners and puss'. I hate those guys...but whatever. Not quite my call on that...
