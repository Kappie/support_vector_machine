As does every single day in May up until the 30th, (although I think either the 30th or the 31st is also off) and also June 4, 5, and 6. I suggest we do it sometime after school gets out but before June 4th. That's just my opinion. The 28th is my graduation rehearsal during the day and my cousin's graduation in the evening. Also, how about doing it at somebody else's house this time? Also, does anyone else have an opinion on what movie I'm bringing? Also, if everybody wants Love Actually we have to have a separate StarWarsCon. Before or after September when the OT DVD comes out is up to you.  When do I get to do the thingy at the bottom, and how?  Irrelevant spoiler: You see that? They did that with CGI.   I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.
