It now has a bulk exchange rate of over 1 penny. If only I had a million platinum.. I would probably end up giving it away.  I have this horrible urge to go to college. It looks so fun.. I am desperate to get out of this stupid town. There is nothing here for me. I think after college, the only reason I would ever come back is to visit my family and to stay here during the summers between school years, and maybe to occasionally toilet paper a former teacher or two's place of residence . Ahh.. college.. the word has this ring to it that makes it just resonate inside my head over and over.. somebody please pinch me. Anyone?
