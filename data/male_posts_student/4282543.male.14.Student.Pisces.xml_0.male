The campers at Scholarship Camp are divided into two large groups- Junior High and High School. Each of those groups is divided into four teams- Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow. Now, at night, the Awana staff is very strict about staying quiet after lights out. After lights out (taps), not one sound can exit your mouth.Well, one morning at the flagpole as we were all about to go eat breakfast, the Awana announcer told the campers to report any taps violations. (You could report people on other teams if they talked after taps.) Then the announcer said, “Last night, the Blue Team captain (He was my captain, one of the oldest guys there, and one of the most respected. He new how to make our team win. We did win, thanks to him.) hit his head on the bed post after taps. He yelped in pain (remember- no noises after taps), and there now is a little pink spot on his head, see?” Everybody looked as the captain begged for mercy. Then the announcer said, “Let me see a show of hands for mercy.” Well, after all, the taps charges were dropped, the Blue Team was relieved.
