I was getting a little antsy even, when me and Patrick hit traffic right before our exit onto Hwy 4.   I had to return Sadia's horn today... that sucked majorly. Her mom is a royal biznatch (keepin it clean) and won't give us a valid reason for why Sadia can't march. Honestly? I've never EVER seen anyone want to march this bad...she was almost in tears when she called us this morning, saying how her mom refuses to let her march.   SHE WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE TO PAY!!!! Me and Pat were gonna take care of her tour fees.  Bah. Stupid people piss me off.   On the plus side, I guess.... We got new music...Awesome music, I might add. The Ballad is a WEE familiar...but...we'll see. You'll like it, I promise
