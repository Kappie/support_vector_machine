Granted,  I stopped without completely lurching the car forward... but details....  So that was fun.  Grandparents came over.  Watched Chappelle (TiVo'd) with mother.  Cried at the funniness factor.  Came back into the basement, played video games.  Got bored, quit.  Thought about FNL, got sad again. Talked to Kelly, no Sonya (!), felt more sad.  So I searched around the web, looked at Alex's forum, then my friendster stuff, and now I'm writting.   On the bright side I'm seeing Kill Bill Vol. 2 tommorow.
