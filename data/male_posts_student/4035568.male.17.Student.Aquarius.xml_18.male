But beneath all of this good hardware is  shitty  software, microsoft to be exact! If this were a Mac, I would not have these problems! Life would be much better, and I would go to sleep earlier, resulting in me being better rested for the next day of hell called life. Why you ask? Well, every time I tell my computer to "Shut Down", I turn off my monitor and leave the room. Then I come back the next morning, and I hear this soft whine, sorda like a computer running. Then I look down and see those bright LED lights on the front of my case, they sorda resemble police lights, and I realize my computer never turned off! So my screename has been online ALL night, and I have to go through and see what 6 or 7 people tried to talk to me about around 1-2AM that night. Too bad I wasn't there to answer them! So now, I have to wait, and wiat, for my computer to turn itself off. It has to Ctrl+Alt+Del 3 or 4 programs everytime to close up shop. And now, I've got this Virus that Norton(An Antivirus software that is supposed to fix these!) remains on my computer, which is something I need to deal with. I'm fine with that, but Norton reminds me every second of the freaking day it's still there. Ill close out the notice window, only to have a new one pop up! And then, I'll shut down Zone Alarm because I can't access ANY websites, and I get 40 pop ups telling me my next vacation should be to the Bahamas, and that *if* I'm not satisfied with my performance in the bed, I can get  LOADS  of medication to fix all that up nice and right. Woohoo!   I'm just about to throw this PC box out the window and bite the big bullet ($) for a Mac!   Until nexttime when my computer lets me access the web again!   T
