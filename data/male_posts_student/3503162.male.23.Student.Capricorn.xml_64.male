There was some really cool ideas like the nun and priest and this pirate that looked just like Jack Sparrow! However the most popular choice would had to be "people" :/ Borrowing from my time at sths, I decided to be a nerd, quite easy thing to do. Steve Urkel is my idol! Not really but yeah. Anyways I had to be in this production number and I wasnt really too sure what I was meant to do so I just copied what other people did. Luckily I diddnt screw it. There was also some nice dance routines that you guys prob would had liked! Especially the bum song! Diddnt do much dangerous things, I tried jumping and off the stage but alas I diddnt stack it.
