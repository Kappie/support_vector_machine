In about an hour I am going off to camp with Robbo and Penmo and we will have tremendous fun with Vicko and Brio (not to be confused with pens..) and whoever else who can be called "entertaining".  If they aren't as much fun as they're cracked up to be (I'll be the judge of  that ) then I'll just sit on my own playing pick-up sticks.  I am bringing pass-the-bomb with me.. That's bloody brilliant.  This is a long post. Probably because of the double linebreaks. Hohum.  Raawr!  Let's make it bigger.  Yes.
