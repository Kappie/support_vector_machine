The flowers I grow in my heart's garden  In the seeds were the beginnings of my dreams  My dreams found hope and sank roots deep into courage which sprouted strong stalks with leaves and petals of love and compassion  The flowers bursted with laughter and hope for the bees to feast on and even in the dusk of my flower's beauty laid the joy and sadness of my journey's end.  --------  What keeps me going... Months's after losing her, I find more than anything else, it is Mom's death, memories of Brazil, and protests, and faces of children that remind me of what and where I want to go in life...  ---------  More later...
