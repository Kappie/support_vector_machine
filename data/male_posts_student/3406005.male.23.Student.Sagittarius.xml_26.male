Unfortunately, it seems that I missed perhaps the funniest incident in the cmpaign thus far. The Liberal braintrust thought it might be a good idea to dispatch hecklers to disrupt Stephen Harper's cmpaign events. They also apparently thought, "Hey! Why send some anonymous shmuck when we have all these well-paid cabinet ministers sitting around doing nothing?" So, ministers John McCallum and Judy Sgro were dispatched to scream at Harper. Here is McCallum gettin' at 'er. Harper's wife, Laureen, just looks thrilled:   urlLink    Scary John urlLink     John McCallum, incidentally, was one of the Liberal star candidates in 2000 who was recruited to bump off the Alliance's ONLY Ontario MP, Jim Jones, in Markham. Since then, he has been a rather bumbling minister in all his roles. Here is his reply to a query concerning whether the national Liberal campaign team put him up to the stunt:    "I'm not saying they did or they didn't," he said yesterday. "But I ended up doing it and wanted to take this opportunity to pass him the letter to suggest any time, any place because it's something I feel very strongly about, the combination of higher military spending and the lower taxes. . . . I'll debate that with anyone."   Not the most articulate guy. But he is also a former chief economist at the Royal Bank. Judy Sgro has clearly found her calling in life, but couldn't the campaign find something better for McCallum to do than this?
