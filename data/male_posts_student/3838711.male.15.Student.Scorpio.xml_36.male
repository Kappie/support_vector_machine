BUT, much to my surprise, a dumb stomachache already threathened my agenda for the whole day since early morning, as early as before morning assembly ! Damn.. it has got to be one of the worst starts for a day....  So I had a struggle with it until I couldnt hold out and rushed to the toilet to relieve myself.... Ooh.. Relief at last. (What the hell am I blogging this thing for ? Beats me.) And the day kicked off, with a whole load of crap coming out of my Aussie teacher mouth.. and PE... the dumb teacher insisted that I do a jog, despite my wobbly self from the incident before. So I ran, and hell, did it took all energy that I had at that moment. Left me gasping for a while.  Along came the English Common Test paper straight after recess, and somehow, I found the paper to be within my handling... moderate questions... kinda ok for me.. After that was Chinese lesson. The teacher gave us back the test papers, and uh.... didnt perform up to my wish... haha... lost to Joshua by half a mark.... 47/50... while he stands at 47.5... argh.. I'm second... but that aint too bad..  After school I went to tease him a little bit, but he went "I can win you by that little margin just because I've got love, and you dont. Go find your love la !" Got me startled for a second (why did he suddenly say this ?), while his saliva splashed all over my face. Aww crap...  So somehow it gave me a mood swing after that, making me think of relationship stuffs again (ahh... hello lonliness !) , and I continued with it since the English test is already over, so theres nothing much to affect my performance on... Stared at the sky during TP, kinda lost in the air for that moment. To hell with what my form teacher's saying. Haha.  Thought of how she told Sherman I was lack of love, and lonely. Other than that she found me pretty ok... but somehow, I just couldnt click to her ba, didnt talk in around 2 weeks already. Hmm.. Also dont know what to say too... Seeing her nick somehow pushes the cursor away, preventing me from clicking it.... But yeah, so I really am outta love, its a fact that I couldnt deny. Well, live with it then. As if I can do something about it. Say, go around asking everyone's number ? Thats nuts. (Yes yes I know I live near a girls school, but that doesnt mean my circle of female friends must be very wide, and I'm always attached isnt it ? Duh.)  So I met KL after TP, was supposedly me waiting for him, now its the other way around since my teacher decided not to cancel TP... Went to Heartland Mall, decided not to let this mood swing get to me for too long, so I kinda acted to be the usual me, had lunch at KFC, and bought another Tomy Nissan FairLady Z Version S. Now I got 2... looks kinda nice when its a duo.. lol.  Headed home (alone) after that, and not long after I see KW calling me for a few times on my handphone, so i got back to him, he told me the graphite cover is here, and hopes I can collect it today. So I took a shower, and rushed down to Raffles Place where he was. Paid him the $62, took my stuff, and headed back home. But I stole some time off to play a bit of Wangan at PS... haha... Hand itchy...  Mum called, told me to get toothbrush and dinner. Bought the stuff, and headed home again.  Noticed that its already 9 when I stepped out of the shower, so I quickly did some things that were due tomorrow and now blogging here, kinda late.  Its really been a long and hectic day, but yeah, somehow I could enjoy it. Its also been kinda thoughtful, since... matters of the heart came knocking on my door again...  Oh yes.. my godfather is going to be cremated today, but I couldnt make it due to school... Sigh..  Thats about it, nightz people !
