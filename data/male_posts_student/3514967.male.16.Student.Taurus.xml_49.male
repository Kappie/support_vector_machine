How come? How have you been doing?"     well, i din study for the test in fact... but it's due to a fact that i lose interest in studying for now... FOR NOW i mean!!! not only i did badly for accounts... i did the same to Geog mot test.. it didn't motivate me at all!!!     that's not the worst... my chem is all along alright... now i dunno why i suddenly give up on Qualitative Analysis... omg... i really muz have go mad... partly may be due to that i have been to stressed last yr and the first semester of this yr.. so i am now relaxing...     mdm low say that i have to strive for the next 3 mths... she say i've studied for 10 yrs for the O level... i cant give up juz like that... haiz... i am really tired... :(     anyway, let's say smth nice... i bought my mp3 player... haha... got alot of songs to listen liao... hehe...     well, i wun give up so soon de lah... i've come so far for the O level... i wun back out juz like that... same for all of u... kkz...
