If somebody wanted to plan a clash of civilizations, this is how they'd do it. These pictures play into every stereotype of America that Arabs have: America as debauched, America as hypocrites. Cheney and Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz act like they know all the answers, almost like a divine right. They don't have a divine right, and they are wrong.    While the photos maybe disgusting, I don't think the honorable Senator could have gotten it more wrong.  These photos did was not play into the  Arab  stereotype, but the terrorist stereotype.  Then the terrorist fired back confirming our stereotype of them.  What did they do?  They found an American and beheaded him on the internet.  Now, the American media, who has been played so well in this case by the terrorists, is equating one act to the other.  Excuse me, last time I checked the Iraqi prison photos did not show any brutal executions.  An American was brutally murdered and the leftist media is convinced that humiliating Iraqi   PRISONERS OF WAR  is on the same plane.  Americans are not hypocrites.  This is not to say we as Americans are always right, but we are not hypocrites.  Hypocrites are the terrorists who complain to no end about American barbarism and debauchery, but they are the most savage people on Earth, killing and maiming innocent people.  The only American hypocrites I see are the liberal media and liberal Senators like Dianne Feinstein, who seem to get their talking points from the Kerry campaign with lightning speed and precision.
