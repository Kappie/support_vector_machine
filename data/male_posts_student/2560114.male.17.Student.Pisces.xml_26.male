Seriously though i dont see how this is gonna get better, if i think its gonna get better it would probly become even worse...what ever happened to the "happy go lucky" charles who just takes life and just plays around...i dont even know...i guess ppl change, but in the other hand...some dont. Some ppl change for the better and some ppl change for the worse, it just happenz, and when u try to help...some thingz help some thingz dont...i just wish thingz would of been different, but i guess thingz that u wish for never come true...thats what i have learned...ive learn that no matter how hard u try at something...it still doesnt get the job done. I felt that i just tried and tried and tried, but nothing happenz.
