They are skaish, they have a keyboard player and stuff, it was ok.  The crowd started to loosen up after that.  I think Then Came Silence was up next, they were good and I got their cd, they are more of a hardcore band, they are from New Jersey and they were really desperate for money, cause they didnt have enough to get home.  I donated some, and I bought their cd and some pins.  Then 9miles2go came up, and they were good, they are on the emo side and I dont think Marty liked them that much.  I got their cd and a shirt.  Designed By You was actually the highlight of the show, they crowd went crazy including me and marty.  They are skacore (mix of hardcore and ska), so you can skank like a wild man and then go straight into a mosh for the fast section.  Some people were crowd surfing, so I joined in on the fun and jumped off a speaker into crowd.  The crowd wasnt that big so I got dropped off at the end. Oops, no harm done.  Me and Marty like hardcore, but we dont like hardcore dancing, cause its pretty stupid.  It's sorta like pretending to do kung fu and beating someone up.  The Before I Go singer was there and was hardcore dancing and he spin kicked a girl in the face by accident.  She got a free sweatshirt and an apology though.  Anyways, My Friend Ehab was next.  A hardcore band which I had been waiting to hear.  Most of the people that liked to hardcore dance were up front where the band was, so it was nice to not  have to worry about them.  During this part, somebody ripped my shoe, which I fixed with staples today cause I cant find duct tape.  Then I realized that there was a gaping hole going down my crotch  and up my ass exposing my boxers, but I didnt care, and continued on my way.  By the end of the show the mosh pit was getting vicious and i was starting to get kinda pissed.  Some people were starting to swing punches, so I swung back. and I think that pissed on girl off and shit hit me in the shoulder.  Also I got my ankle kicked out under me alot, so its kinda sore today.  I got a Designed by You shirt and stickers and pins.  All in all it was a very fun concert.  Unfortunatly Designed by You wont be playing for awhile because my cousin Ben is going on tour in California with 9miles2go.  Im gonna do homework.  bye
