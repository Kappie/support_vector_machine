Got all five letters gathered and sent it in. So I'm crossing my fingers that I'll be able to get my hardship back in time and be able to drive to school. Now that I'm 16, it's really gay I can't drive. If I could drive perhaps I'd get a job. Buy some cool/stylin' clothes or something like that. All well stupid Arkansas driving laws! That's all I've got to rant about for now, take it easy all.
