Saturday last....I got into Atlanta sometime in the afternoon courtesy of my classmate Ama (safe and sound)....we went to a graduation party for the homie Voltaire who finished Morehouse with a GPA at least a full point higher than I finished with (he's the man!!).....then we went to the homie Nile's house for his graduation party....it was over by the time we got there but I came bearing gifts....he called Me, Kasi, and Malachi the Three Wise men carrying Hennesy, Frankenspice, and Mirh (or however you spell it....and yes I know it's not frankenspice but that's what he said)....anyway the Hennessy bottle almost got us in trouble....after awhile of me catching up with my boys Reggie and Maurice and flirting with Nicole (one day she will see I was serious) his mother comes downstairs....long story short I had to make a blood promise to her that the son she worked so hard and yelled so much for would walk across the stage the next day....he did....  Still Saturday....we headed back to Kasi's and changed....met up with Antoy and headed to Cafe Something or the other at Lenox Mall for an Alumni Party....I was the youngest person in there by about five years (or so it seemed)....then we headed to Fuel....all the while drinking copious amounts of Crown Royal and Scotch....needless to say I was pretty gone by the end of the night....so I hope my good friend  urlLink Beth   can find it in her heart to forgive me for the silly way I behaved when I saw her in NYC's parking lot....  Sunday....after two hours of sleep we headed to Morehouse's graduation....I felt a surge of electricity flow through my body as I stepped onto the campus green....Julian Bond was in the middle of his speech when I arrived....I saw alot of old friends and some people I would have rather not have seen but I was in my element....I had many friends walk....I took a moment and sat with my good friend Travis's family as he walked across the stage and I was also able to give Nile's family the thumbs up as he passed behind me....the best moment of graduation for me (well besides seeing a couple of long standing crushes) was when Nile passed through the processional and hugged me....I was really happy for him....  After graduation we hung around a minute taking in the sights and then headed to Cafe Intermezzo to meet our boy Damian and his family....I had a great Breakfast Burrito (of course under a fancy name)....we had good sports related conversation mostly about the draft....I enjoyed myself....after breakfast I meet up with my mom and we head to my Uncle Steve's house to see my dad....  Dad looked good!....he is still in his wheelchair but he was in good spirits and we enjoyed some great Barbeque....my Aunt Kym and her son Lil Conrad came by and we all really enjoyed ourselves....later on my mom came back and my sister Nina got off of work and came through....we talked with Uncle Steve and then me and Nina left....I don't feel inclined to say much else about me and my sister's conversation other than I learned so much about her strength....people put alot of talk into me and Che but I see the   BIGGEST   things coming from Nina.....  Monday....I woke up late (as is the custom on my visits to the ATL) and headed to Uncle Steve's....I met his physical therapist Phyllis....she was really nice and it turns out she is related to one of my classmates....Dad did really well....it seemed he was a little pressed about doing really well for my sisters and I, but his progress is amazing....we spent the rest of the afternoon eating leftovers from Sunday and watching movies....I had planned to spend the night so my sisters left and Uncle Steve, Aunt Phenola, her father Big Daddy, my pops, and I watched Scarface....I really didn't give it it's due the first time I saw it....it was really a great flick....  Tuesday....My dad got a visit from his speech therapist, Pam....she was also really nice and she worked really well with Dad....then we headed to see my uncle Harvey....he is due to have some work done on his back and he was in alot of pain but you would never know it unless he told you so....my Auntie's Gee Gee and Stella also came by along with my cousin Margie and her daughter Jamilah (spelling man....I always say these names....never have to spell them) and a friend of Uncle Harvey's Dr. Hill....we had good conversation on the state of the world (mostly me, Auntie Gee Gee, and Uncle Steve) and good ham sandwiches....but more importantly I think it was good for Dad to see all of them and vice versa.....we headed back to Decatur and I went to see the lovely aforementioned Beth....we had good conversation with a side of Mickey D's and she let me listen to the new Eminem (a must buy if only for Superman)  Wednesday....once again destination Decatur, but not before being entertained by my six year old cousin Jasmine...she is a trip and a half....she sang Lil Bow Weezie for me and did some impressions....she is the greatest....so anyway we brought some KFC over for Dear Old Dad....spent some QT....then I headed to my friend Tiffany's....I am kinda selfish and I sorta inconvienenced her in just dropping by unexpectedly and then having her take me home....I felt really bad about it cuz I live far, far away and I didn't have the use of anyone's car....if you ever read this I'm SORRY TIFF!!!  Thursday....I went to lunch with my friend Lyndsey at my favorite spot in Atlanta, La Fonda Latina.....then we picked up her sister and saw Spiderman (for the third time....still love it)....then I went to see my Aunt Lynette who has by now surely found the URL to this site since I slipped up and mentioned it in conversation....  Friday....most of the time was spent either packing or on the road back to Nashville care of my cousin Radiance  Which leads to today....checked out two and a half movies (that is how movie hopping goes....they don't synchrnoze the movies for you!...the un-facists!!!) Insomina (pretty good not great), Enough (better than I expected...need to catch the other half), and Unfaithful (great!!....must own on DVD!).....and I caught the end (and best part) of the Celtics game....went and harrassed some of my peoples...  And that is my busy week...it probably took a week to read all of this....and in the Eastern Time Zone I am 23 years old....Happy Birthday to me!!
