I did however, manage to pick up a nice copy of  Tintin and Alph-Art  yesterday, which seems to have influenced my decision to write a post about this incredibly interesting subject.  Highly unlikely, I know, but I hope you enjoy this short delve into the world of eBay.  I'm going to explore the fascinating field of eBay IDs.  Before any individual can join the eBay community, he / she has to choose a nickname to be identified by within eBay.  This is referred to as an eBay ID.  Many IDs are unpronounceable, but many display humourous or entertaining qualities, such as mine, which I think sums up my 'end of auction' feelings; 'franticdilemma'.  Call it what you will ;) .  Richard suggested 'Outbid_me_and_i'll_kill_you_in_your_bed_as_you_sleep', which I also think is very appropriate.  At least now I can relax, safe in the knowledge that the good book is finally on its way ...
