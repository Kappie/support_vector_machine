GOSH!  they're breathing at the wrong places and arent even lookin at their dynamics and WE HAD TO STOP A GAZILLION TIMES!  i mean how many times do you have to sing ONE MEASURE before you get it right!  GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!  i want to break somethin.  ok lets see what else is there that's botherin me....ummmmmmmm....im so broke its not funny....i have to try harder in algebra 2...and i have to get blood taken.  oh and then there is my license which i guess i need to get...but i dont feel like it.  cuz i dont have a car to drive and its not like my parents will actually let me drive one of their cars around.  so i'd have to buy myself a car and then get a job to pay for gas and insurance...which i cannot handle!  i just started to be ok with all this anxiety disorder and junk cuz i've learned how to deal with the anxiety i've had and now its like i got a new kinda of anxiety to deal with!  its not cool at all!  ill probably end up in counseling again before this year is up...which i really dont wanna do!   	im so like...FRUSTRATED!  i just want to go lie down and take a nap.  but thats impossible cuz i've never been able to nap.  and where is mal?!?!?  she's not online.  i was gonna call but she said she probably wouldnt be able to talk anyways so i didnt even try.  didnt wanna get my hopes up.  did you know that i saw her today at school like i do everyday...but right now i am REALLY MISSING HER!  i wish she was here.  that would be very nice.  its like i can relax when she's around...and everything kinda goes away and i feel ok.  life is so sweet when she's with me.  she really is an awesome person.  if you dont know her then you should.  i swear if there were more people in this world like her then life would be so much easier!  I LOVE HER!  i'd love her alot more if she was online right now...and i love her a whole LOT more if she was here!  hahaha! 	ok i guess im kinda feelin better.  not really but hey life is not perfect.  i learned that lesson already.  so im gonna try and not be upset bout it.  ha!  yeah right.  i guess ill be ok.  ok well dunno what to write bout now.  i think this is sufficient for now.  haha!  big word!  ok well yeah!  bye!
