I can understand if that isn't funny to you, but after reading the posts I discovered that I didn't know anyone named Summer Gypsy, I mean that isn't a name, more of a title, then I remembered that we weren't suppose to use our real names. Ha ha I forgot, ha ha. Yea I know that I am very sad, but that's the only way that I have fun.  By the way today is Gen. Sed. b-day, so happy birthday you damn bastard.  Come by the house  to pick of your gift, I have Sharifah's too.
