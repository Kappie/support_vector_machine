When I first saw the movie, I was amazed at the ferocity of the whole thing but the actual reality of the story didn't hit home. I knew it had really happened, but I didn't realize the depth of the stories of those involved and the impact on the world this event had. In that way, the movie is really just a small fraction of what actually happend.  I got the special edition DVD as a birthday present last year and watched the movie again. Afterwards, I popped in the second disc and watched the special features which includes a history chanel presentation as well as a PBS presentation where the actual soldiers present on the mission were interviewed. Suddenly, in my mind, the story had just been taken to a new level. I needed to know more.  So I recently picked up a copy of the book. It progresses at a very quick pace providing second by second detail of the entire mission. I just powered though it. Not only does it give an account of what happened, it also gives an insight to what individuals were thinking and feeling throughout the duration. Not only that, it provides an angle that the movie did not. The angle of the Somalis. The account of people that were in the fire-fight but on the other side. More importantly though, it provides an incite into why the somalis fought back so furiously.  The result of this battle not only changed the lives of those directly involved on either side, but the world. The outcome of this fight changed American foreign policy because the U.S. was fearful of more American loss of life if it was to intervene in a foreign conflit again. This led to the US ignoring the Rawandan genocide in and around 1994. The butterfly beating it's wings in Somalia caused a hurricane in Rawanda. Makes you think...
