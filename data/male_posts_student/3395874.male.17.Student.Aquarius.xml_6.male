Its graphics aren't that flashy but the gameplay does more than make up for it, plus its extra low system requirements makes it possible for even the outdated ones to play it.  It's called the earth lords and it really rocks!  I'm gonna attend victory weekend this friday... hm... wonder if anything extraordinary will happen there.
