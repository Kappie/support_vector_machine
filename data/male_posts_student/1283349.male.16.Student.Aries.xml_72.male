No star spottings today, I'm afraid, but we sold about three times as much as the other two days combined. Also, that OSX consulting job is certain now, so huzzah!  Damn, my mom is so weird. She doesn't want to go see the last great rock and roll concert on Earth, despite our having enough passes. I don't even care if I don't drool over Jeff Beck, when you have him, JJ Cale, and Eric Clapton on stage, with BB King thrown in for good measure,  magic  is going to happen. So fingers crossed on her changing her mind.  I have -got- to tell Rachel about Jimmy Page's guitar, that shit is  wild . The man did Stairway to Heaven.  And did you know that the concert today is 11 hours long? The History Channel is there filming, and they're going to almost immediately re-broadcast the live performances, because it's the greatest rock concert of the decade, and perhaps... of our very civilization. But then again, they're prone to overstatements. Heh. Who knows, though? I don't think anyone besides Eric Clapton himself could gather all these great names together.  Another day, another dollar. (That's like, what... three dollars now!)
