I might go into it later, but the movie cast me into despair and anger.  If you didn't like Reloaded, or didn't see it, DON'T go see Revolutions.  If you did like Reloaded, DON'T go see Revolutions.  I could write ten thousand words on why, but I'll spare you that here.  So, look for some more posting later today.
