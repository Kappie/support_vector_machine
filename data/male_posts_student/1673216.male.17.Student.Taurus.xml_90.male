There comes a time. It has not yet come yet. That's the point. The time is not here, the time is not now. Sometime in the future? Maybe. Probably not. We do not deserve this time. But, I personally have faith it will.  This makes no sense. You don't think I realize this? I might as well randomly strike keys and make sure to throw the spacebar in. It isn't supposed to make sense. It's just streaming words. Streaming across my fingers to its final destination of your brain recognizing it, and matching it up with the trillions of past experiences you've had reading things. Coming up empty. Not being able to decipher it.  Then you realize. It really doesn't make sense. Voices in your head. Simiilar to the person talking to me right now. Staring at me. Talking as if I am listening. I don't even know who it is. Gone. Finally. That was irritating.  Am I awake, or asleep?
