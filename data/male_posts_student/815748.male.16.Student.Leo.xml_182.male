After staying up late to do my memorandum, then this morning writing my outline and then going to John's house and hanging out with John, Loren, and Bao-Bao, I did pretty well on my history final.  My essay ended up being the same length as that of Matt Woolf, and I think I made my point effectively.  I also finished like twenty-five minutes early.  The following is the plan I have for Friday, open to suggestions.  I'm thinking of having Loren, John, and Melody come (in addition to myself).  I tried to make it as multilateral as possible, but I haven't gotten anybody's official, unequivocal assent yet.  12:00- Meet at John's house, go to lunch in Newtonville, maybe Cabot's for a change  1:00- Stop at my house, maybe do something briefly (e.g., badminton), then walk to the Embassy  1:50- Matin√©e, "Control Room," starts at the Embassy; go  urlLink here  and click on "TRAILER" on the bottom left to see the trailer.  How about it?
