I arrived home from work at 9:30, and found I could only just squeeze my car into the driveway, as a large pile of dirt was covering half of it. Once I got out of my car, I spoke to a worker who was just leaving. I enquired as to whether the dirt would be removed, and when. He assured me that it would be removed 'first thing in the morning'. Satisfied with that, I went to bed.  Wednesday. I look out the window at 11am, to note that the dirt is still in place. A truck sits beside the curb, but of industrious people removing the dirt, there is no sign. Clearly my view of 'first thing in the morning' is not the same as others. I note the name on the truck, and ring the company to enquire as to what is happening. The 'customer care representative' on the other end tells me I need to ring my electricity retailer, and get them to put a complaint through to the line company, who will put it right. I ask why the people who are there  right now  can't fix the problem, but to this she has no answer.  So, I ring my electricity retailer. Apparently New Zealanders are the most likely in the world to switch electricity suppliers, often at the drop of a hat. It seems the person I speak to is well aware of this fact, as her service could not be faulted. I give the details of the problem, and she promises to forward the complaint. Progress, and after only two phone calls. Too good to be true.   Yup, sure is   Twenty minutes later I receive a call from the line company. What work was being carried out? I inform the operator that I have no idea. My concern, I remind her, is that I cannot get out of my driveway without resorting to rally driving. It is their job to know what the work was, not mine. After promising to get back to me shortly, she ends the call.   Three hours later, and she has not called back, and the dirt is still there. 'Shortly' and 'first thing in the morning' are clearly relative concepts.  I take matters into my own hands, and phone the line company myself. The helpful soul I speak to this time has never heard of my complaint, and doesn't want to know. His advice? I need to ring the contractor myself, and get them to fix it. I ask why I was told to go through my retailer. His reply? "I don't have all the answers" Stifling my urge to tell him that he in fact has not provided any answers, I ask again what happened to the complaint forwarded by my retailer. He advises me that I need to speak to the contractor direct. When I mention that perhaps I need to speak to his supervisor, he suddenly is able to locate the complaint in the system. Funny that. He is still adamant that I must ring the contractor.   So, getting really sick and tired of the run around now, I make the call to the contractor. And I am pleasantly surprised to find a sympathetic person, who genuinely wants to help. She says she will make enquiries, and promises to ring back. Haven't we heard that one before though? But, to my amazement, ten minutes later, she does indeed call back. Unfortunately, there is nothing that can be done until the next morning, as it is by now quite late in the day. I am assured (again) that it will be dealt with first thing in the morning.  And indeed it is. Finally, my driveway is accessible again.  What did I learn from this experience? That the person who had nothing to lose, ie the line company who has the contract for services whatever happens, could not have cared less. Where I was dealing with companies who I could choose not to use again, they were friendly, helpful, and kept their promises.
