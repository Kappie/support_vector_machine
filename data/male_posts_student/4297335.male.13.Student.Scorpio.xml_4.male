Dappled morning   sun is flying,   breaths of breezes   rising, dying,   brushing over the earth's   brown skin.      Happy morning   my heart is singing,   arms spread wide   the dawn is bringing its sunglow to this life, of mine."      so nice ....   today learn new song... for choir..   the song very nice... have like those ...   very nice melody....   this few dayz my life has changed so much and so fast....   so many things have been changing so quickly...   i think that even my best friend, her life also changed...   i find myself more like in a new world?   think* so...   hahax or maybe i day dreaming...  hahax.....   heyz... jus saw a bright star... must make a wish...    i wish....   ********.................................................................      kkz... i now damn scared that tmr give the gangters find me again   for no reason....   hai.... looks like mix with wrong friends le.... sian.. everyday must face their sickening looks   hai.. e other thing is my studies... im so so stupid.... daily work can do ok   but when come to test i thing also canot remember....   also most everyday stay at home and study... but then cant pass or is either jus pass by one mark only... i tink studies is not for me... i better in other thing ba...   well anyway what i can do now is to try my very best to pass and hope that teacher will give me a chance to go to express....   my academic class sux sux sux so much ... like don talk or shout also will die...   drivin me mad man! they sux so much.. especially those childish little boys... still singin the teletubbies song at this age... so shamefull... i don think they will ever grow up hai....       jc_girl....
