Well I don't want to dwell on the bad stuff so I'll give some highlights....I saw my cousin Bryan for the first time in a while.....we kicked it hard....went to the mall where he hit on every girl with a pulse and some redeeming quality....we went to Applebee's and knocked back a few drinks....and we went to the casino where we got cleaned out on the Blackjack tables....we almost got run off the table for awhile before the guy next to me intervened and started giving me some tips....I was up $200 at one point and probably should have left well enough alone....but I had to get greedy....I left 100 in the hole....  I flew on a propeller plane in the legs of my trip between Atlanta and Nashville....man...talk about scary....and it's small too....I'm glad i'm noat claustraphobic or I would have gone crazy....  Speaking of planes....I feel compelled to speak on Delta's monopoly of southeastern flights....it makes no sense that a flight to Meridian (with a layover in Atlanta) costs less than a direct flight to Atlanta....yet because Delta has exclusive rights to that route they can charge me and anyone else flying that route an arm and a leg....it's just not right I tell ya....  I think things will work out so much better for my aunt and her kids with them in Mississippi with my Grandmother....it lessens some of the tension that was so strong and still growing with them living in my mother's house....maybe it was the circumstances, but our family hasn't been nearly as amicable in YEARS....funny how death can do that....  My family was loving the digital camera....Sony should give me a commission because I think I virtually sold 3 of their cameras to various people over the weekend....  Anyway another long week is coming....gotta hit the hay.....
