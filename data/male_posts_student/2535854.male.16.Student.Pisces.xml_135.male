So today went to visit Mr.Chew (my neighbour)who`s in the Sunway Medical Center ICU ward cause he had a stroke last night..turns out an ambulance came at 2am yesterday but like the siren was off and like my room is all the way at the back anyway :p.To like forever to find it or not forever but kept making wrong turns so had to make cirlces to get the right road to go to!So anyway got there at like 7:30 pm..yeah yeah I know late eh?Anyway he seems fine..although he`ll is likely I think parylysed on the right side of his body,he`s conscious which is good..his pressure is a bit high but not so bad and his heartbeat is fine and he`s in stable condition..anyway left at like 8:30pm..  I so wanted to go to Sunway Pyramid but my parents didn`t want to !HMPFH!!Thats it la wei..my parents are gonna kena..next time I go shopping which should be Friday(2day actually!)they are gonna get it!I`m gonna spend like a madman la wei...Hopefully at Sunway Pyramid or 1 Utama..Mid Valley is a sham!It is the worst place to shop at!Sungei Wang lagi bess to shop at..Stupid Mid Valley doesn`t have Goggles or Monsuier Nicole!!Can you belive it??OMFG how could they not have those two shops?They are the bomb man!Terrible la tis Mid Valley..
