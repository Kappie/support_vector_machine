He was extremely opinionated and said something to the effect of 'anyone who doesn't have an opinion on today's issues is a dumbass.' I don't want to be a dumbass. So I figure I might as well get my opinions out there. First of all:  War in Iraq- umm...I don't think it was justified in that senior presidente lied to us. He knew there weren't any weapons of mass destruction. That said, I'm glad there is one less maniacal dictator out there. Do I think it was worth American lives? Well, taking into account all the people Saddam would have killed and the tradition his sons would have carried on, yes I do. It would be better if  no one had to die , but the fewer the better; all lives, Iraqi and American, are equal.  Should we withdraw troops?- I think we need to clean up our act. We aren't making any friends over there, and we are making enemies, but I fear that if we pull out now, it leaves the country susceptible to another maniacal dictator to take Saddam's place.  On a closer note, gay marriage- I often get smashed for my views here, but here we go. I believe there are some eternal rights and wrongs. I do not believe that homosexuality is right. I do not think it is natural.  BUT  I DO NOT THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD REGULATE MARRIAGES. The government builds our roads, so they can set traffic laws. They can regulate what they give us, but they did not give us the practice of marriage, so they cannot regulate it. Marriage is a completely religious affair, so let the churches decide whether or not to marry gay couples. I think gay couples should receive all the same rights as married couple do under the law (tax reductions or whatever). Again, I do not believe homosexuality is right, but I do not facilitate any hate towards gay people. I have known many gay people and they were wonderful people! I just don't believe some of their decisions to be correct. But that's the beauty of life! We are free to do what we want! Free agency man... rock on!  Well, thats all the stuff I'm gonna talk about right now. I'll write more later.  Anyway, TV Turnoff week is coming up April 19-25. I plan to participate ( i watch way too much TV) I encourage all to participate as well.  I wonder, we try to embrace the stars, yet we're afraid to embrace the person sitting next to us. Why do we search for extra-terrestrial life when we don't fully understand ourselves or our planet? We should understand ourselves and the world around us so that when we find those aliens, we will really have something to share with them: life.
