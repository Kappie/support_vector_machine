Ummm this week is being boring, except yesturday was cool cause I got to hang out with Sharon and some other cool people. Today, I went to school and hung out with some friends, did a little work (cause that's what you do at school lol) and now I'm home, I started to watch some movie on USA it was sweet, about some killer guy.   Anyways, I can't wait till Christmas break! It'll be a lot of fun!   The band is working on some new songs, and I made us a new website.  urlLink   You can find out more information about us there. I think hopefully we'll be practicing on Friday or Saturday.   peace*  ~Tim
