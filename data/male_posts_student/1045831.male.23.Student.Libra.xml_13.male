I woke up about 2:30 (alright that is not very productive at all but it gets better).  I hung out with the fam for a little bit.  Went and worked out.  It wa a rough workout and I pushed myself real hard but that is the best way to work out. A funny thing happened though.  I was on the stairmaster (what a pussy) and was watching the chiefs game (ok he might be kinda masculine) and Trent Green almost threw an interception in the end zone.  When this happened I heard a loud thud.  I looked over and the guy to the left of me had lost balance and fel of the treadmill. Trent was not only hurting The Great Chiefs that day but also poor innocent middle aged men trying to work off the gut.  well then I went home and ate.  FInished reading Galileo.  Wrote my paper on Galileo.  Then went and rented Changing lanes and watched it with Claudia. Stayed up and talked late into the night (You can call me Mary) and then drove her home.  When I came home I was very horny and couldn't get to sleep.  It was a horrible thing to toss and turn cuz of all the God given testosterone. Ohh well..  I deal..  well I'm off to study for my Physics and West Civ tests...  Everyone out there wish me luck...
