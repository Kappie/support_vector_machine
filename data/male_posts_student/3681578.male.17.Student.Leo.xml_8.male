Then I'll be like David, a bum, org-less, I do hope he is not reading this...hehehe...  So there...Three Erya Absences and you are a goner...I already have one (last Saturday: Guidance Thingy) and I am gonna have another tomorrow (going to the movies with some old friends/my birthday celeb with them)...So I MUST not be absent next time...  There...plus upon reaching home my burden grew heavier...I have to do this collage-thingy for my little sister who will be badgering me till I finish it...and the thing is I can not tell her..."Why don't you do it? So you'll learn how to!"...shit! fuck! ok lang but I have a TON of work to do plus the fact that I am going out tomorrow leaving me just one day to do all my work...  Lets enumerate...  1. Lit 13 Paper on Sugar Coated Dreams...half-done...deadline-Monday  2. En 11 Paper on Paper Proposal...to be started from scratch...deadline-Monday lest I let Gimo thrust me into hell...  3. Ma 21 Long Test Revisions...hmmm...highly needed and must be squeezed in between school work and vacant periods...deadline-The Long Test is on Thursday...  4. Fil 11 Readings...hmmm...I haven't read much, maybe just a couple of poems and a couple of stories...deadline-there is no deadline but the next Fil class is on Tuesday and I MUST not come unprepared for class...  There...  I was kinda satisfied with Math kanina since I was successful in solving all the problems he discussed plus I even pointed out (to Dianne and Raj) more "elegant" alternatives to Doc Mara's solutions...  ***** is so obnoxious, so David says...pacute-pacute effect...anyway, change topic...  I just read Raj's LJ and Val's LJ...and I wish Val would indicate the Jerome she is mentioning in her blog...wala lang, just so people know...  Its my birthday on Sunday but unlike my previous birthdays I am not actually anticipating it...mainly because I can now get a "better" picture of what life is, being a college student and all that crap...  I have this new idea for this blog that I cannot put in to action mainly because I am too tired and exhausted to do it...  Come to think of it, commuting is sucking the life out of me...going to home is not as difficult as commuting to Manila as there is more heavy traffic flow there...but the distance does matter...  Several times I had thoughts like boarding, renting a small place/apartment, etc. In short, living near Ateneo...But I just can not imagine me waking up early alone...alarm clocks do not work on me...so I am actually handicapped in that sense (I can not wake myself up...shit!)...  oh well...   --Logged Out--
