I've never donated any money to a political campaign before (and it's not like my $10 is going to really make a difference -- although what could a 30-second ad on New Hampshire public access television cost? :) but I figured why not.  This way, even if I never get a chance to vote for the particular candidate I like best, I can say that I did something.
