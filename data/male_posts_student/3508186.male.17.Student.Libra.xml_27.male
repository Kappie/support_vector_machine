No, not really, it was kinda good, but it had that, "I know this isnt human food" kinda thought to it.  It all started when we went over to Kassandra's house. I was talkin about Zobmondo, she was looking ever so cute in her pajamas, and we decided to go to Walmart and get dog food. Ohh yeah, Josh was there, I seem to have forgotten about him while I was thinking about her, lol. So we bought some dog food, put it on some bread and I took three bites. It took me awhile to chew it up but it soon got to that point and had to go.   Well, it's good to catch up, I think. Peace
