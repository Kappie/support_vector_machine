I have never had so much fun in my life. The Flugtag is an event where teams make contraptions and attempt to fly them off of a really tall ramp/barge into the river (in this case, the Williamate). The winners were decided on who had the most style and/or flied the farthest by a panel of judges consisting of pro extreme sports and local radio station personalities. The top prize was $7500 cold hard cash but it was mostly really absurdly silly and brilliantly stupid (oxymoron?) and the teams seemed to be more interested in having fun than getting any prizes. They had some really cool looking flyers but few actually did any flying... the farthest flight was 40 feet and most just dropped like a rock. Its actually really fun watching an elaborate, heavy contraption drop with a satisfying, shattering smack with pilot inside. We were right on the beach and about 30 feet from the actual flights. There were oodles of people watching, lotsa media coverage, and enough yaghts/random boats crammed together on the river that you could have walked across the river on their hulls (that is no exaggeration, you should see the pictures). There were so many people at the waterfront watching that everyone was squashed together arm-to-arm and they eventually closed it off not letting anyone else in. One would have to swim thru the crowd just to move 5 feet. The news later said that there were more than 50,000+ peeps there watching. There was all sorts of media coverage. It was fully broadcasted live on ESPN and on the internet. The other broadcast stations had lengthy spots on the nightly news, probably because of the publicity that has been given to the event in recent weeks. After that (it was about 4-5 hours long), we walked all over the waterfront and downtown looking in the shops and ate a very delicious lunch at an Italian restaurant. Tom's mom was nice enough to drive us to the Saturday Market in the morning and picked us up at 6 PM later. In the time between we had all sorts of fun... there was even a beer garden. There was enough alcohol there to float the whole place up into the heavens.  I was going to go camping this weekend with my family, but i have had enough of them... so I stayed home and went "Flugtaging" with Tom. I am going to go out to dinner at Black Angus with him and a bunch of other friends tommorrow nite... a sort of going away party as he is moving to Kalamazoo, Michigan on Monday.
