And here I was, downstairs, in the living room, alone in the dark, literally.  And it hit me. It has been so long since I've been happy that I don't even remember what it's like. I sat, staring blankly into the television. I was empty, completely empty. I was, no, I AM a god damned robot. Or, at the very least, close to it.  Voiced raced through my mind, speaking languages I didn't understand, thinking thoughts that I could not comprehend. Adel and Chris, laughing haughtily in the catacombs of my mind. Not all laughter precludes happiness.  I flashed back to the image of that Indian man, walking fearlessly down the runway in an attempt to stop the plane from taking off. If you've seen The Terminal, you know of whom I speak. In the theatre, when I saw that, I cried like a baby. This image, this image of a tired old man standing up to this monstrous steel juggernaught, to meet his end, to meet his destiny, struck me at my very core. I saw what he was doing, what he was doing for a friend, and I cried. Against all odds.  There was a perring knife sitting on the coffe table in front of me. I picked it up, and scrubbed off the apricot remains with the palm of my left hand.  The entire bus ride there, I looked despairingly at my left palm. I would look out the window, and out of the corner of my eye, catch the drip drip dripping of blood from my palm, and I would look, shocked at first, only to find that there was nothing. Over and over, I kept seeing this cut across my hand.  I picked up the knife, and, babbling carelessly in a language thus far unheard of, tears streamed down my face.  I knew that I was so empty, so alone. What did pain even feel like? The opposite of pain is pleasure, but if I always feel one and not the other, how will I ever tell the difference. So hollow.  I knew it had all come together like this for a reason. Crooked teeth made me this. Sore teeth from the dentist disallowed me from biting into things. I used the knife to cut up the apricot. The knife sat there, brought there by a mad destiny.  I cried myself my very own river, motioning stabbing myself several times, but could not do it. Like poor disgruntled Noah (no, not from the bible) I cried mentally disabled tears. Twitch to the left, cry a little, sniffle, open your mouth too wide, shift your jaw to the left, twitch again, bow your head left and forward, look at your shoulder, cry more and more.  Fiddling with this knife in my hands, I could not, or maybe would not cut myself. I had thought it so easy before. I dragged it slowly across my left hand, remembering back to the trip.  I heard the sound of footsteps I had heard one million times before, but not really. They were heavier than hers, less organized, they were his. He came and sat down all too close to me on the couch. He noticed the knife in my hand all too soon.  He asked why I had the knife. I didn't respond. I don't think I even knew why I was holding it. Simply because it was there? He turned and looked at my face, and right away noticed the tears strewn across my face.  I find it funny how I tried to frown. I found it difficult to get my lips over my teeth because of the braces, but did he really notice in the dark?  "What's the matter?" He says. I did not respond. I could hear the chills up and down his spine. Or maybe they were mine. She came downstairs, and he switched off the television. She knew something was wrong. She looked and saw that I was in tears. No, in shambles.  She, too, saw the knife in my hands. She hated knives. She freaked out. She was angry. She scolded me, to give it to her. I at first resisted, but what was the point? With a flashy spin of the blade, I handed her the knife. She knew me. She checked me for cuts. She made me swear that I had not cut myself. I had not.  "I'm going to die alone" I say. Boy, I live a charmed life.  I left, to clear my head, or maybe to freeze to death. Some job of that I did, I wore two sweaters on purpose.  I always knew the waning half moon lead to trouble, and it sure as hell did. It made me crazy. Surely.  "God, take me now, take me to where I belong. That is surely hell." Looking up at the night sky, free of red and clouds, clear for a change, I said this. A long silence. "Then you disagree." He must have. I am still here, are I not?  Sitting atop the school, tresspassing, although nobody but me really cared, I was alone to our thoughts. I looked up at the half moon, laughing. It was so funny to me that yet another one of my, my, oh what to call it...Predictions...Had come true. I realized something.  I  believed I was crazy,  they  believed I was crazy, but Chris and Adel were adamant; I was not crazy. In a voice that only I could make sense of, Adel put it quite eloquently, in her French accent, I might add:  "You're not insane. You're not bipolar. You're not a paranoid schizophrenic. You're not even paranoid! You know what your problem is? You're a socially mal-adjusted son-of-a-bitch."  And it made perfect sense.   Your blood is my blood now.   A destiny spun in too many directions will soon break.   Although, the thread all ends up in the same place.
