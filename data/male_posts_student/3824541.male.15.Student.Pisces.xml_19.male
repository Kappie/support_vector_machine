Check 'Untitled Post 1' for some more about the story, and other scenes. ----- (Red Dress)  		I stopped for a second, and I couldn't help but look at it. Just five years ago someone had been part of the dress, and now it lay untouched haning on a wall in Goodwill. The red thing-that's all it was now, a thing-seemed so one-dimensional. A passerby would never guess the story of the relic, but I knew it. As much as I tried to forget it I couldn't, and I  sometimes wondered why I tried to shut it out. I had learned from it, some good some bad. 	The first time I saw it I thought it's owner was dead, and later I learned that it's owner would be better off dead. If she could have, would she have chosen that path again? I was thinking these thoughts and others when I saw the man. In one strong hand he carried a trashcan, and in the other he carried a broom. 	"She's strange, ain't she?" The man asked. "If you're interested I might be able to cut you a deal. I'm about to throw it out." I shook my head. I wasn't interested. 	He knocked the dress down with one swipe from the broom, and for a split second, before it fell into the garbage, I could have sworn I had seen a person in the dress not knowing whether to smile or frown.
