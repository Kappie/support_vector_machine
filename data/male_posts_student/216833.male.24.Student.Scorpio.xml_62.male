I've been making more and more small talk with the janitor, eric. That guy is for real and just goes about his day with little complaint. He is an idiot all the same, but he seems happy so thats cool.  Like I posted lastnight - I saw Mulholland Dr. That has to be the no.1 most fucked up movie I have ever seen. It was good, but I am still confused.
