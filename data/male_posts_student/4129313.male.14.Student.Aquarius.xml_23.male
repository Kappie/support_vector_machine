If you ever met her, you'd know what I'm talkin about, you just can't explaing what is so bitchy about her, but you just KNOW. I had to run today in PE, it was the first time I had run since June. I realy need to get out more often, I didn't even know we had a wally world down here till some one mentioned it the other day. We took a tour of the campus in my Study Skills class (why don't they just let all the freshmen roam around like lab rats or something?) and not supprisingly I knew where everything was allready. I guess they assume nobody has friend's who were freshmen last year to show them around like me. (did that make sence lol) My german class is going abit fast, but I get the jist of it all. I have an advantage over everybody else anyway, seeing as I'm of german descent. Again, I still need some help developing my blog, so if you have any idea's, or better a template I can use, please speak up, I have it set so that anybody can comment.
