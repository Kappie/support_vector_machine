Seriously if I had to pick an actor who did funny work in the eighties, let his career slip in the 90s and who does great stage work now, I'd pick  urlLink this guy . Broderick's just so smarmy! Although, he does get points for playing Bloom in The Producers. Still he impregnated Sarah Jessica Parker with his smarmy spawn and that is unacceptable!  By the way:  AnimationCon:  Erin: Rachel: Tyler: Paul: Jonah: Chicken Run Nathan:  Michael: Spirited Away Thomas: Sophia:DUMBO!!! Marten:  and...  MusicalCon: Erin: Camelot Rachel: Tyler: Paul: Jonah: Either Into the Woods or Newsies Nathan: Camp (if I can get a copy on DVD) Michael: The Sound of Music Thomas: Sophia:undecided...dangit. Marten: I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.
