The latter is the shorter member of his urban supergroup, standing three inches short of Dré at 5’8’’. The former proudly proclaims himself as a “5 foot 6 inch God” in the middle of “Evening News,” the 11th track on his latest release, Cee-Lo Green is the Soul Machine. Regardless of size, though, both him and Big Boi talk big, live big, and weigh in big, evidence being Cee-Lo’s portrayal of himself as “The Soul Machine.” This godly status is not the only big statement that Cee-Lo makes throughout the album; on “Glockapella,” an anti-Goodie Mob thrash over a slowed down, whip-cracking James Brown beat, he ensures that “it’s gonna get funky when I’m fryin’ these little fishes.” But like Big Boi, he also takes time to share his sensitive side. Both of them employ their young sons, Big Boi’s Bamboo and Cee-Lo’s Kingston Callaway, to drop lines at some point in their albums. While Bamboo is used to karaoke Outkast’s “The Whole World,”  Kingston is used to reinforce his father’s position as the Soul Machine, which only emphasizes the maintained attitude that Cee-Lo clearly draws out within the last twenty seconds of his album, in his response to the question, “Shit Lo, what don’t you do?” His response: “Fuck around.”   This lack of fucking around starts early, in one of the two collaborations with Pharrell, “The Art of Noise.” Over a beat that features sly finger bass, a piano line akin to the one in Jay-Z’s “Change Clothes,” and a rolling drum line, Cee-Lo claims that he “sings because [he’s] happy, and [he] sings because [he’s] free.” Free from what? Well, he’s free from his former group, Goodie Mob, who he clearly sees as negative from the 4 minute bash in the aforementioned “Glockapella.” He is also free from his previously-shackling position as a little-known indie rapper, which he proves in a few ways. For one, this time around he is able to guest star the real Ludacris on “Childz Play,” not the Ludacris sound-a-like Big Gipp, who he featured on “Suga Baby” from his last album. Secondly, he is able to book huge producers this time around, from those two Neptunes tracks to tracks with Jazze Pha, Organized Noise, and, most impressively, Timbaland.  This joint with Timbaland, the simply named “I’ll Be Around,” is the centerpiece of the album. Sure, it is an ego boost, which Tim has an undeniable knack for producing (check out Missy Elliott’s “Lick Shots” or Tim’s own “Don’t Make Me Take It There”), but Cee-Lo has an incredibly intellectual sense of swagger, which he demonstrates through lines like “With a smile on my face, give the trophy to second place right after I won/And shake his hand firm like a man, but talk to him like a son.” The staggered beat sounds recycled from Tim’s “Funky Fresh Dressed” on Missy’s 2003 album “Under Construction,” but jungle thump percussion, horn vibrations every four measures, and an electronically programmed trumpet-funk line underneath each chorus make it all its own. This horn-laden production perfectly equals Cee-Lo’s affection for jazz-band instrumentation, as is shown on both “My Kind of People” and “Living Again.” “My Kind of People” alternates between lazy soul-club trumpets, a climb-up piano line, and absurd bongo percussion, while “Living Again” has a shakily-produced mute trumpet collective amidst its bridge, which leads into a chant-along chorus featuring Cee-Lo’s rapid spit.  Probably the most intriguing tracks on the album are those that take Cee-Lo into unexplored territory, of which there are many. “All Day Love Affair” is the urban revival of Super Furry Animals’ “Hello Sunshine,” with etch-a-sketch percussion, shy keyboard chords, and an underlying funk guitar that sounds like the slow motion patterning of pieces from the beat in Michael Jackson’s “Wanna Be Startin’ Somethin’.” This Jackson pastiche comes out again in the spoken word piece “I Am Selling Soul,” where in the middle of liquefying techno a string line emerges that sounds loosely based on the strings in “Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get Enough.” This track’s soul brother, the spoken “Sometimes,” mixes MC Honky and Baz Luhrmann, of “Everybody’s Free (To Wear Sunscreen)” fame. The beat is Honky, with coiling Snakecharmer flutes fluttering around growing strings, while the delivery is Luhrmann, as Cee-Lo drops insightful paradoxes for the passer-by, like “Sometimes hunger is the best food.”  This metaphorical idea of food is all over this album, and, probably not by coincidence, all over Cee Lo’s career. Lo states “I’m still standing in line at the world party trying to get some soul food” in “Die Trying,” which is both a comparison for his music and a reference to all three Goodie Mob albums that he contributed to. The most prestigious of these albums is Goodie Mob’s debut, “Soul Food,” a Southern typicality that has defined not only the sound of Cee-Lo’s music but also the extent of his genius; he gives haters some food to bite on in “Scrap Metal,” he predicts the nutritional appeal of his next girl in the excellent “The One” (“I bet you taste so good”), and he feeds his listeners violence in “Evening News” (“Now open wide and let me put the knife inside ya”). As stated, Cee-Lo is a large man, and maybe the big, ideological message of this album is the fusing of his appetite and his attitude into one bold statement for the entire world to hear, haters and lovers alike: He doesn’t fuck around when he’s eating.
