However, when you become a member of the blog, you're free to post anything you want. This blog should be a clearinghouse of any useful ideas you have.  To join, send me a message through hq.protestwarrior.com. My alias is Thohan and I'm a member of the U of U chapter. Just say that you do (or don't) want to join the blog. I'll take care of the rest.  Also, if you don't like the look of the site, let me know what you prefer. I just picked one of Blogger's ready-made templates. I do web design and I can customize the look of the site.  The main purpose of this blog is to encourage people to contribute all their thoughts without filling other members' e-mail inboxes, like I've been doing lately.
