Then they move in.  Jim calls it saving money.  I CALL IT INSANITY!  Everyone is back.  So all five Kings will be together again.  This time plus a fiance, a baby, and a grandma.  Oh man...  This is gonna get a little nuts around here.  Kinda want to be alone for a while.  Or maybe not alone, just without my family for a bit.  Too much.  Too much going on too.  Yargh.  Also I have been falling asleep really early lately.  Maybe its from getting wiped out at work or I have the west nile.  Birds have popped up in Berwyn.  So its pretty much inevitable.  Crazy amounts of work I would imagine.  I mean, what I do is some what physically demanding (extreme heat) and definately mentally draining (between tours and driving not trying to kill anyone).  Whatever.  Making excuses.    So anyways, yesterday was my dad's B-day.  We made him a special cake.  Suzie-Q cake.  Jim had the brilliant idea to frost it, but that was a BIT overkill on the sugar.  Had to throw half of it away.  I will get around to putting the pics up eventually.  Craziness.
