One week it can be in the 70s and the next week it's snowing, the roads are covered with ice, and the thermometers max at 10Â°. Last couple days have been terrible. You would walk outside for 2 seconds to get the mail can come back in with no feeling in your hands/arms/legs. It's perfect weather to go outside and play basketball in. But then again at least I would have an excuse why I can't make any shots. I could always just blame it on my bleeding hands which turned purple. They would never know.. I really miss the summertime. All those great days at the basketball court. Walking around like an idiot. Wasting way too much time at Valley High Ice Cream. *sigh* But look on the bright side. Now I can enjoy all of those things PLUS a side of frostbite. Awesome. So the weekend was ok. The football games were all very good. I was hoping that the Packers would beat the Eagles though. I hate the Eagles with a passion. I have to give props to field goal kickers though. Man I'd crap my pants if I was Akers. But I have to say, I would like to be the Colt's punter. That'd be the easiest job on earth.  When angels cry blood on flowers of evil in bloom. Listen to H.I.M.
