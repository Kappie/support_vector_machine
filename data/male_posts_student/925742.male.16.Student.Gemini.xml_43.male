Funny story actually:  Since Christmas vacation, I couldn't find my book.... and with this book report but not a book sumamry thing due this Wednesday, I never really finished my book.  SHIT! So I naturally turned to the Net.  And it never steers me wrong; in fact, it helped me find the whole fucking book in a GIANT text document.  So I spent from 4 to 8 finishing half the book and then I wrote the assignment.  Yeah, I'm a speed reader.  What else.... nothing funny per se.  Geometry test tomorrow; I never study for jack shit, and anyway I'm better than the SENIORS in this class at this damn class, ha.  And, who all reads this thing?  Message me on AIM to tell me if you do.  I expect about 8.  WrathS01 is the name.  0wning n00bs is my gizzame!
