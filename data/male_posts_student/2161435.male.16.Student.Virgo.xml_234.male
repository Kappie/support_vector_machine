We were unable to get a lane when we arrived (about 7) so we had to go for 8.30. It cost us, collectively, almost Â£30. To pass the time, we played pool, air hockey and a couple of arcade games. Actually, I think it was just the one.. But never mind. Bri and Dan won the pool, but Vicky and I came close! Then on the air hockey, Vicky won against Bri, and Dan only  just  beat me :P  Then it was about 8.30. We went to our lane (7) and discovered some foreigners had jumped onto it. Obviously, they were french. Once that problem was sorted we started bowling.  I can't be bothered to run through the  entire  game, but the best moment was probably the very end. Remember how if you get a spare or a strike on your last bowl, you go again to see what the score will be? Vicky got a strike. So she bowled again, and got another strike. So she bowled again, and got  another  strike! Go Vicky!  Then we all missed a couple of busses, but that's not really exciting. Except the AMAZING sounding jam band in some pub.. I wish we had time to go in there... *sigh*  So what else can I blabber on about? I am officially working at Waitrose. Expect me to be able to do things such as:  Buy things Not scab money off my parents  Isn't that good? I have a green shirt, a tie (clip-on, even though I asked for a real one) and soon I will be getting another shirt and some trousers. I need though, to get some "polishable" black shoes. Fun.  What else? My parents are going up to my sister's house today. I didn't want to come so I'm at home. Alone. All alone. So alone...  Hmm. This post isn't long enough yet... Let's make up random crap. Today, out of my window in my back garden, I heard a funny noise. I went out there to find out if it was one of those rowdy boys. It turns out that it was my neighbour, Peter, who was holding onto a Flux Capacitor. It turns out that he built a time machine, like in some movie I've seen, and he said, "Play the best song in the world, or I'll eat your soul!" Please forgive me for combing Tenacious D with Busted. I deserve to die. How the hell did  Busted  get to do the soundtrack for Thunderbirds?! Why the hell do kids today know about Thunderbirds? It should be designed exclusively for people who are old enough to appreciate Thunderbirds. Damn Busted.  That's long enough. Yes.
