MY batting in the game really suka budden i still safe thanks to lousy fielding by compassvale.....Msh Softball team doesnt rely on me cause there are Aaron, Jia Yuan(WHO ALMOST MADE A GRANDSLAM), Timothy(who made a solo homerun), Nicholas the zai catcher...all batting pros....My pitching ar......2nd inning so suky pitched 7 balls in a row OMFG! budden marcus say must set the target for me hehe and strike all the way untill the inning ends hehe..Gary took over me and did a good job dut only to find out that he was only able to play for one inning due to time constrain. The B boys made a superb come back coming from below 3-5 to beat them 15-5 muahahahahah..MSH SOFTBALL TEAM ROX(but hey, that is obvious)
