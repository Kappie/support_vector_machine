I went Leicester shopping yesterday for clothes for 6th Form...came back with one pair of trousers :( Paul, Gemma, Charlotte, Ruth and Gemma's sister Jessicca went.  I went home but then I went for a walk, and cried my eyes out, I've had a lot on my mind recently. So anyway, I rang Gemma and she came out and comforted me, which was good of her.         Jack
