Well, you know what, I've been told that my entire life and I wanted to prove them wrong with this one; this was my final shot for Lauren and I wanted to try and give it my all and be successful. I didn't want to just try, I wanted to succeed. I wanted to prove everyone wrong that said it wasn't even possible, I mean, have some faith, or at least pretend for me. Damn, I guess I'll just have to show everyone "when I make it big..."
