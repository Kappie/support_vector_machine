But I had a busy weekend, so I suppose I shall not be too hard on myself. ;-)  Saturday included sleeping in, eating a massive breakfast, working out and playing worship on church. Sunday was church again, a 15k bike ride, an 8k hike up a mountainside, some reading and finally sleep.  I've felt out of time at the end of each day lately, and I think it's cause everyday of mine is so full. Maybe I need a holiday. *laugh* Too bad I can't afford to take one. Yay for the life of a student.  Finally, if you are a fan of politics, political humour or if you are American, i would sugget you check out this little  urlLink cartoon . One of the funniest things I have seen on the internet since the  urlLink Ghyslain the Star Wars Kid  was passed around a few years ago.  Anyways, I don't know when I will get a chance to actually post this musing, as my computer is running a virus check and port scan right now, so hitting other internet sites may be unadvisable. Perhaps I will throw it up when I get to work. Shalom all.  Rooster
