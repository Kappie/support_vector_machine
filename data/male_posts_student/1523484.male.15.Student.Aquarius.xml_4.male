This lovely service is called  urlLink SquareSpace .  It was a bit goofy at first, but I'm actually getting used to it.  Through doing so, I've re-created  urlLink Platform X  in an all new way.   urlLink Check her out .  Oh, and I've also generated  urlLink my own FOAF file  through the use of Kenny's own FOAF generator, which can be found  urlLink here . Until later, exeunt.
