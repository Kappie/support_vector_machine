I don't think there's anything cool about it. This f*ckin idiot jumping around probably for a hot chick who look as if she was still a virgin despite the fact that she is 34. Just for that, I'm gonna watch Scarface ALL day. Guess what? I haven't seen Spider Man, and I'm not gonna see Spider Man 2 either. What's even 'worse' is that I haven't even seen one episode of "The Lord Of The Rings", because it is  gay . Yes, just incase you don't believe what you just read, I'll confirm it for you; I said  I haven't see any one of the LOTR episodes!   I swear I'm afraid I'll be publicly executed by the gathering of gay film directors. This pressure I feel whenever all the people start talking about a gay new film that has been released is tremendous. But, oh well, I'm not gonna support any film studios that make crappy films that have the same plot over and over.    The Tattoo that is on my backside  I have reached the point where I don't blame u guys who go on and on, bragging about how u were the first person to waste $15 to get into the premier to see the film. Really, I don't. I came to realise that you just have such boring lives, that u need something to brag about, and  perfectly understand you, don't worry.  Nevermind! I created my own action star, whats better is that he has more powers than Spider Man, he can hipnotise any one, because he is Ukrainian, and he was created in the tragic accident of the nuclear reactor melt-down. He is around 2 meters 30cm high and has a face that doesn't remind us of anybody. ... ...    Attention! If you see this horrible creature anywhere, do not attempt to disarm it.
