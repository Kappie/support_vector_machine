Did you know that those who appear to be very strong in heart, are real weaklings and most succeptible?   Did you know that those who spend their time protecting others are the ones that really need some one to protect them?    Did you know that the three most difficult things to say are : I       love you,Sorry and help me    The people who say these are those that actually need them or really feel them, and they are the ones you really need to treasure, because they have said them.    Did you know that people who occupy themselves by keeping others company or helping others are the ones that actually need your company and help?     Did you know that those who dress in red are more confident in themselves?    Did you know that those who dress in yellow are those that enjoy thier beauty?    Did you know that those who dress in black, are those who want to be unnoticed and need your help and understanding?    Did you know that when you help someone, the help is returned in two folds?    Did you know that those who need more of you are those that did not mention it to you?   Did you know that it's easier to say what you feel in writting than saying it to someone in the face?   But did you know that it has more value when you say it in the face?   Did you know that what is most difficult for you to say or do is much more valuable than anything that is valuable that you can buy with money?   Did you know that if y ou ask for something in faith, your wishes are granted?    Did you know that you can make your dreams come true, like falling in love, becoming rich, staying healthy, if you ask for it by faith, and if you really knew, you'd be surprised by what you could do.
