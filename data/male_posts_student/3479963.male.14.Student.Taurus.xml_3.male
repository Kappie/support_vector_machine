However it was like i just found out that this show is very weird and its getting rather confusing, not to the eyes but to the mind. The story is about a girl being forced to marry into a rich family, however the rich family had a son who is dead!! What the~~ Someone marrying to a dead person~~!! Weird yEh..! And out of the blue, the son of the rich family comes back~~ another BIG ? Well~~although it is a weird show, it tells us much about life which i find it very interesting.  Hmm... i am gonna have a barbeque tomorrow after school. It's not a class barbeque but a family babeque. Thats the big difference~~ with family, it;s rather boring in the sense you dont see fathers or mothers foolin around, playing around where there will be much fUN!! NAh stop the crap talk. Back to the topic, my mum asked me to call up some of my friends to join me but it's like last minute and it's after school, who would want to come~!! Haizx!! BAdly planned~~   I've been wondering why I have been feeling rather depressed lately. Of course not due to that crappy somg 'Gloomy Sunday' haha... look!! I can still joke~~lalala. Maybe it's just some personal matters of the heart. i've been rejected twice.. O.. That is like so SAD =( okok.. it's always that, whom u like mght not like you.. but whom you do not like, likes you.. haizx..   CONCLUSION: I will not give up!!!!~.~
