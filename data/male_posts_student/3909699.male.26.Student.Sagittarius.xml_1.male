This is very similar to a much lower-key and underrated proto-reality show on BBC 2 years ago in which two people swapped lives. I can't even remember what it was called, but clearly remember a show in which a New Age traveller was swapped with a conservative farmer with hilarious results. In tonight's episode of Wife Swap, a woman from a rural Devon family with, by my estimate, four kids is swapped with a fat woman from an urban Northern family. I tuned in half way through the show, just before the point where, after trying out the lifestyle of the host family, the swapped wives impose their own regimens on their hosts. The Southern mother demanded healthy eating, exercise and family cohesion, to the utter chagrin of her temporary husband and unbounded joy of her temporary daughter, who had been suffering in an environment of emotional and physical under-nourishment. The Northern mother determined, and it was pretty surreal to watch, that the cohesiveness and incessant activity of the Devonian family was pathological - she resolved to smash their family routine and locked their bicycles in a container. She did try to clean their house up, which I thought was fair enough. But her recurring claims that the family had an unhealthy obsession with exercise which they obviously did freely for enjoyment was patently preposterous. The background to this was spending most of the day with my sister Laura and my new constantly-vomitting nephew Moss. Laura explained to me her philosophy of child-rearing, which is commendably child-psychology centred. It incorporates peripherally the hypothesis that inadequate child-rearing is to blame for broad social ills. While I tend to balk at these conclusions, it is undeniable that breeding needs to be done deliberately, and that where due deliberation is not taken, the consequences are deliterious for the pretty much everyone. As things stand, such consequences are ubiquitous - both Laura and myself are the products of decisions to bear children which were not part of a plan which had our welfare at its heart and have suffered the consequences (Laura much more so than me, I must say). Family planning doesn't mean just planning whether to have a family, but actually having a plan for that family. Do I sound like Bill O'Reilly?
