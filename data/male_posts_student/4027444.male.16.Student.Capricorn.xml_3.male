I finished summer school, did the exam, got a job, wasted some marijuana ('cuz one of my friends brothers can't roll a doob for shit), and went downtown.In any case here's the update on my art:  - I've finished three rolls of film this past week and today downotwn so expect some deviations These photos belong to three seperate categories: industrial (a cool 19-th century industrial complex turned govenment office), downtown (taken with (DA user) ~Ritaly who made me expose the film >_  - Cleaning up the SCRAP section: from now on the scrap section will only be used to keep the original photos for my deviations. This means that the scraps "Past And Present - Future Lost" and "Capitalist Machine-Soldier" will be deleted. You can still post your thing tho ~Ritaly.   - Nesckthe44 Signing Out  TTFN
