But what do I know     And now it seems that i have found   Nothing at all   I want to hear your voice out loud   Slow it down   Without it all   I'm choking on nothing   It's clear in my head   And I'm screaming for something   Knowing nothing is better than knowing at all     On My Own    /      i sit and hear you sleep    i don't want to go    youre there beside me    but youre so far away    i talk to you    while youre asleep    you can't say a word    you can hear everything       tears are feelings we cant say    tears mean that you care    tears are mixed emotions    tears are more than tears       the pouring rain    from my eyes    means too much    to keep inside       i sit and watch you leave    my life forever    i know youll be gone so long    my last words are nothing    and i tell you i care    and nothing more    i can't say how i feel    so i cry       tears are feelings we cant say    tears mean that you care    tears are mixed emotions    tears are more than tears       it's the light    behind the shadow    that sacred face    behind the mask
