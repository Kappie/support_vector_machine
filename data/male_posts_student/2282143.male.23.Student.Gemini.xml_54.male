So yeah, today I saw a truck go through the car only I-pass lane.  Was funny.  I look over as I pay my toll, and the dumb look on the guys faces (2 of em in the cab) was pretty priceless.  The guy in the passenger side was cringing and they went through, just BARELY clearing the top of the sign.  Then they proceed to scream at each other as I pass them.  Oh well.  I guess you just had to be there.  Silly Dollar General drivers...  Ok, how cool is this?  Phantom Planet and Stroke 9 at Western Michigan on Monday.  How sad is it that Sam got tickets for us on the floor just last week?  I guess they just dont understand music up there like they do down in my beloved Chambana.  That, and tickets were only 10 bucks.  SO HOW DOES THAT NOT SELL OUT IN A FEW HOURS?  Its because they are all very ghetto up there, to my understanding.  Either that or Christian Rock.  I still have yet to find a good alternative station up there.  Its all B96ish, Country, or God.  Although they do have a classic rock station, which does me just fine for the long drive up there.  But still, it kinda amazes me that a show like this does not get sold out just for the simple fact that its only TEN BUCKS!  Maybe Im just jaded from Dave's $50 shows or the $40 concerts at U of I.  Student discount my ass...  Or maybe they just dont know good music when they hear it.  ANYWAYS...  Saturday night should be fun, as Lark has invited me to go to the Bar Associations Ball downtown.  Fancy!  Should be cool.  Then partying when I get home with my little brother.  Then Sunday, Mary Jo will be coming to visit and I get to hear all about Brazil and how nuts it is down there (get it?  Brazil nuts?  Ok, that was lame...).  Then Monday, having a party with the crew from Allied Health 105 (the CNA class) where I get my A and have a party.  Then off to Michigan to have a BLAST AT THIS AWESOME CONCERT.  At least if it sucks, Ive only wasted $10...  Life is swell, now if only the zoo would pick back up.
