It has no meter whatsoever    -------------------  Sometimes things wont work the way that you want,   sometimes I pretend I am the things that I'm not...    So why do you want me?  Make me feel like I do-  What makes you long for,  Me and all my many moods.    You I do not understand,  But I live.  The other asked me out-  It'd would never work out.    I told her I was a Virgo, she was a whore,  That I wouldn't fall victim to her.... sexy lore.    Sometimes It's life that doesn't make sense.  Why do I always... act on pretense?  Chaotic tension burningly surrounds me,  No way back now, how did this envelope me!    Is this life-  As I know it?  Is this life- to never have enough.  It can always be wose, never to find  A way in to a heart, no one is mine.    And now- that everythings Different,   I've been left behind.  No chance with either,  I'm stuck in a bind.    Why would someone hate me?  The world can be so cruel.  And  when I share someone's feelings,  My Heart gets sent reeling.    Is this life-  As I know it?  Is this life- to never have enough.  It can always be wose, never to find  A way in to a heart, no one is mine.  ----------------------------------------------    See? Shitty.  I doubt anybody got anything from that.
