I can think of 2 reasons why small children enjoy blowing bubbles,         The fact that they are bubbles, spherical and shiny, bursts when you touch them etc...    The child is just happy because of a oxygen high, resulting from the hyper ventilation involved when they are trying to blow the bubbles.     bah, better get back before she does a rendition of "Baby's Day Out" :/    Meh...
