I'll try tommorrow, then if cannot, then timwee to the rescue! I was v bad to Timwee over the phone, because I felt a bit down abt the whole hp thing(some1 said would tell me if got a new hp..I'm still waiting). So when Timwee said tt he wouldn't be coming for chess training tommorrow, I was like, "Good". Aiya, I feel so low down to vent my spleen on poor timwee. Anyway boot polish rox! While the NS thing is a bit cliche, it was delived originally. And the Filipino totally owns la! Wow, pro... Pity im not going to the drama or music or wadeva tommorrow, so i wun see Gab, but i got chess training,very diff to reach school in time. Haha, now I have logged 1 more blog entry, I can slp peacefully. :)
