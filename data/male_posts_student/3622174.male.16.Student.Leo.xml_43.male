It's called Xfire, and it's in a beta test right now, however, it's more than just an instant messenger service.  This is the instant messenger for gamers.  Once you sign up, you'll be able to see everyone in your "Friend List," and what they are currently playing, if anything.  And, you can also join in on their game right on the spot, provided that it is an online game, and you have the game yourself.  This is a cool way for gamers to get to know each other better, and a cool way to meet new friends to battle in your online games, like Warcraft, Diablo, or America's Army, per say.  It's got a slick interface, which far surpasses any of the other messaging clients.    Because its built for gamers, XFire features a unique system for tracking what your friends are playing.  It shows up right in the  friends list what they are playing, and it is so easy to use.  All you have to do is put your mouse clicker thing over the name of the friend that you want to look up, and then it will tell you the game they are playing, and what server they are on.  It's a nice little addon to an instant messaging program, and gives you a better chance to meet up with other gamers to play against.   urlLink    XFire is the instant messenger for gamers... you can see who is playing what, and join in on their games as well. urlLink     If you're not a gamer, you *might* still enjoy this program, but, I definitely recommend it more to the gaming crowd.  You're going to have a lot of fun using this program, it's gotten much praise from many different sources, and since January, over 3/4 of a million gamers have signed up.  It's fast to download, it's only 756 kilobytes, making it incredibly easy to download, and getting started is even easier.  This one is a definite recommendation from me.   Pros  +Instant Messenger for Gamers +Nice interface +Shows what friends are playing, what server +Fast to Download   Cons  -If you're not a gamer, you may not enjoy it.
