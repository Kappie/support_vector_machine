It seems like everyclass has a big project due on the same day lately, so it's just taken up alot of my time. I kinda feel bad tho cause I see my friends wanting to hangout with me, but I just can't cause I'm so busy. But yeah. spring breaks coming so everythings gonna be cool. So I'm still happy tho! God's awesome. I got on the honor roll at the college so that's great, and I'm making some extra extra money babysitting this week, and yeah I'm doing ok.  If you guys could pray for me, I've got some family probs going on and if you could pray that I make time for my friends, and esp God that'd be awesome. I'm trying to get into the groove of daily devotions so please pray for that! Alright I'm going, so I hope everyones doing awesome and remeber that I'm praying for all of you!
