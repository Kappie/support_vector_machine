I showed them the photo, and they said something I've heard one too many times. They said,"You're crazy." I was utterly shocked, to say the most. But then...the police officer ripped off a mask showing that he was...a Republican. You don't want to run into them into dark alley. Fortunately, I was in the police station, not in a dark alley. Unfortunately, it was dark in the police station that wasn't a dark alley. So I say to him "Look! Yet another Middle-Eastern Country to blow to bits and make them free but really under our control!" and I point behind him. Being a Republican, he fell for it. I ran. It was bad, to say the most. But I was desperate. I needed to find an authority. I ran into a Janitor. He asked me if a toilet backed up. I told him that the Republican in the police station was after me, and that he needed a push to the right. Unfortunately, he was a Leftist. He jumped me. I couldn't stop him. He took out a knife conveniently hidden in the toilet. I kicked him, and fled. That made two evil people after me. Then, I met the worst person I could ever meet in person who I knew was evil. Al Gore. He said,"Are you okay? Y'know, I invented being okay!" I ran...again. I was shot by a random person, and died. The Beginning.
