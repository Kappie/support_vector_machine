Well at least I spent an enjoyable day with my old friends. Lazy yea, he cheated me of my feelings! I wanted to play tennis in the morning and was suppose to meet him at his place but when I reach there I only get to watch Harry Potter before going to housing Mall to get the food needed for Kenosha BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION! (Happy Birthday 17th Dude!). The show wasn't that bad actually. We ate Steamboat together in a group of 7? (yea, Birthday boy, Siok, Zc, Jackey, Jonathan and me). After that we had a hard hard ice-cream cake for Swenson. The cake is obvious too cold to the extend that Siok can't bite the strawberry and it took Jonathan a great deal of strength to cut the cake. Nice job man. After that we took a night swim after watching Incredible Tales. Even though I have read the story on spi.com.sg before. We played with dried ice in the pool and got chased away by the guards because we were making too much noise. BOOOOO~! We have enjoyed ourselves though and it is late already. That's roughly wad had happened yesterday. AND Siok did u pray haRd for me? I still lose. ARH! This is bad man. Better pray harder for me u pig!   Yesh Yesh Yesh! I'm so happy. HA. Serene made a unfruitful trip to sentosa again! YESH! HA. Mr Sunny FAILED to show up and she did not get to tan. I told ya not to go. Don't say I did not warn ya.  I am having my org camp in 5 hours time and I still can't get to sleep! Blame it on my flu~ HaizZzZZ I don't really feel like going because the reveals for the org is actually quite bad. I have to try it myself to noe how bad things can get but I still hope that it is as fun as the TPSU Freshman Camp. My FOC ROCKS~!!!!! Custos ROCKS too
