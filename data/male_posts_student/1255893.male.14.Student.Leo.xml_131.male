I'm thankful for a lot of stuff and people, but you guys should know who you are by now. Yes even you kaitlyn...... though I doubt you read this anymore. Please people don'ty give me shit about how I'm supposed to hate her right now. Truth be told I never hated Kaitlyn, jus that a friendship between us doesn't usually last over 3 months or so. Why be hurt 4 times a year right? But hey..... thanx for the good times!   yesterday i had roy, jose and johnny come over to play vice city and true crime. Aaron was scheduled to come but his mom had to work and he had no ride. We miss you =[. Lj came home last night too which felt awesome. Wuv ya =].   right now im sick. Jus a minor cold. Mommy's workin on dinner. Ima go help her out right now.  I'm watchin space jam :P Woah.... I can remember watchin this movie over and over when it came out on video. When my brother came in the room he'd be wonderin how the hell i could watch this thing. Then when he found it playing on VH1 earlier he said " hey vain ... " I turned around to see the screen. at first i thought ... eeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwww. then i was like " ok hold on.... why did i let his opinion take over mine?" I realise i still love this movie. I dunno, i guess i was tryin to act older by usin Lj as an example and emulating him. And now that i feel a bit of shame for not bein myself, i can be thankful that i chose such a great example =].
