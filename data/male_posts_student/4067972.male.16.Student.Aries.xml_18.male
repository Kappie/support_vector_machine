He had to get up fer work thismorning, so i had to get up at 6:15. I saw morning today. I even wrote a poem entitled "i saw morning today". here goes it.  i saw morning today. it looked kinda nice. i'd like to see morning more often, but it's so damn early.  Hope you liked it.  I know, i was a deadbeat this weekend, but it wasn't stuff that i could do anything about, so oh well.  It all started with this movie downtown i was gonna go to with at least one of my friends, but that plan was erased when this whole episode with my step brother, his girlfriend, and their two kids came up...like i said, that's another posting.  Then i still planned on going to sam's surprise birthday thing at tory's, but i had a family dinner thing and i didn't leave the house until about 5:45.  I got to the right street in about 10 minutes, but i couldn't find the damn house, so i went home to call people, but that was unsuccessful. So i went back to the street hoping someone i knew would be outside, but  of course, no.  Then i went bak to my dad's and called nicole and she said it was gonna be over between 6:30 n 7, and it was 7 so i said screw it.  So just so you know, i really tried, it didn't do much good..but i tried. Oh well. I'll go now.
