Oh yea and in the OC Register's report of the Weenie Roast they totally goofed on Jay Bentley's name... they called him Ian Bentley.  I saw Super Size Me with Naomi N today. It made me angry at Binghamton Univ. for dealing with Sodexho and Coke (and probably a sweatshop using company for clothes).  People make arguments for capitalism, but what does it mean that students on campus have few choices when it comes to food. Expand that to the urban landscape in which healthier mom and pop shop restaurants get wiped out by McDonalds, Taco Bell, KFC, etc. It's scary that how ubiquitous the golden arches are as I think I've gone pass the McDonalds in LA and NY that they featured in the film.  It's ironic when one thinks that it's up to the eater to make good choices and not the fault of these fast food chains, when it's hard to pick up healthy items on the go. It's even more messed up when the so-called healthier items at fast food places aren't as healthy as people think. Salads at McDonald's can have as much fat as Big Macs.  Work again at 6:30 AM... arg  **
