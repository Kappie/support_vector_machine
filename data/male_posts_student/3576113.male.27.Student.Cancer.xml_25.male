Two years in Thunderbay, I missed my friends, road hockey, I felt very alone. I did find literature so the city ain't all bad, but loneliness is the worst.  2.Ever been in a situation that was so FUBAR'd because of too many personalitie's involvement? Family reunions were always off the hook and the drinking always made it worse. Movie night was often interesting, have to admit there's some I'd a never seen if I ran in differnent circles.  3.Lost a friend to death? Adrian played D with us for about 4 months, died in a car accident riding with a drunk driver. I have the paper somewhere and still have his pencils and dice.  4.Made a pact? Everytime I moved there were promises to keep in touch, but most have been lost with time.  5.Jumped off something high? From a bridge into the river all the time on dares, I was a crazy 10 year old. From a roof to dunk a basketball once, my heels of my feet hurt for like 3 days.  6.If you had a superpower what would it be? I'd like to be able to cure mental illness, or to be able to go without sustenance and modify body temperature  7.Pulled a prank? I was always putting the power out on my sitter, hehe I was a crazy 10 year old.  8.If you could live the life of another, who would it be? Well you don't get to hear stories about content simple people, so I'll say Adam Sandler. I figure he's as cool as he appears.  9.Commited a crime? I did get fined for littering and some community service for shoplifting, and did a few things for which I never got caught. All to my everlasting shame, hehe line from the Count.  10.Have a friend that you wonder how you ever hooked up? Yeah, for sure a couple. A black rapper, a heavy drinker and drug smoker, my closet friend from high school and a gamer like me. The third in our little trio, a chauvinist and a porn fiend, I suspect our commonality in interest I might have had something to do with molding.  11.Gave up on something dear cause someone else thought you should? This I've always tried to avoid, which might be why I didn't date in high school. I know I had to stop playingsports cause we couldn't afford to keep myself in shoes.  12.Ever went somewhere for explorations sake? A pretty broad question I guess, as this happens everytime you see a new store or wonder if there's any new movies out. ThoughI always take the side streets, or would cycle in random directions, wander through hills and forests. Been in abandoned buildings and construction sites, done door to door sales.  13.Ever beenso nervous so as to have everything completely blow up in your face? I know I aced my acting debut, and most oral presentations.You know despite much fear I think I've did ok up till now, hehe but I'm not so aroggant to think there's not plenty of oppurtunities.  14.Ever thought about a post apocolyptic world? From time to time, I am the romantic remember, so you can imagine it wasn't all bad.  15.Ever been afraid for your life? Once, my sisters father and the onceabusive boyfriend of my mother was a complete Psycho. Knife weilding, starter pistol shooting (our house was on the front of the paper for that one), and many squabbles occured during those 4-6 years.Servedas a court witnessandspent some time in a women's shelter. I've since resolved to never live in fear and that bastard is dead now  16.Ever been let down by someone you depended? I've been pretty lucky I guess a great system in tact around me friends and family, i've prolly been more of a dissapointment to others.  17.Been so high you have holes in your memory? Prolly twice. I was so sick but wanted to work, I gonked back way too much Nyquil and on my lunch break somehow made it to the park and passed out for the afternoon. Other time there's was like 10 of my friends all crammed into this little 8 x 8 room all smoking up, with little or no ventalation I guess I got totally messed up and I never touched the stuff. I don't remember any of things they said I did or how I even got home.  18.Pretended to be a differnent person so as to attract or turn off a member of the opposite sex? Done both, went to see Fast and the Furious which I knew I would hate and car shows, watched the sound of music, I enjoyed the company but she wanted romance. Isn't hard to turn on the obnoxious meter in a pinch, so yeah I've pushed a few ladies away in my day.  19.Had something you loved ruined by someone you loved? I'm sure one of my dogs chewed one of my fav G.I. Joes or wrestling dolls over the years, more recently in a video game I lost some flowers I'd been collecting and a tower I'd built. It hurts but in the words of a few peeps, meh, get over it. Stuff don't mean shit, is funny how deluded we can get.  20.Been in a exclusive group? Maybe but I might have been oblivious, I usually seek out the loners and try to be pretty welcoming in general.  Hey that was pretty fun and even cathardic, I'll do another 20 some other time.
