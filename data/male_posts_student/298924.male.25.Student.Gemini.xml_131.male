I wrote three poems while sitting in a boring endocrinology lecture.....I debated whether I should publish them or not....I decided towards not....  Today is a self wallowing day.....I need a hug from someone....maybe I'll get one....I went and spent more money that I don't have at Banana Republic....some how this cycle must end....
