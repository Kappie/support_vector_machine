(you thought i was gonna say a bad word, didn't you?) damnful day.... so damnful..... truly a friday the 13th classic..... my day started when i woke up at about 5:30am, then i slept a few minutes more, then woke up again and started my day as usual... brushed my teeth, ate breakfast, took a bath while thinking, dressed up, and not forgetting to bring my....... my keys and ID..... it happened before, FYI.... then, i rode our car, our Land Cruiser, with my brother, mother, our driver and our cousin who is a recently graduated( not that recent ) college student and is now an official teacher in our very own kindergarten in Chiang Kai Shek, so good luck to ya! when we got there, it was the usual...when i got in our class, the usual... when class started, the usual... NOT! class started with our so-called-freak teacher (freak which was coined by adrian)... it turned out that she checked our test papers early and finished as early... so she made us check our own test papers for corrections and errors... the first test to check was our values ed paper... i expected i would get a higher grade than i got, but obviously, i didn't..... so i used my imagination... to imagine that i got a higher grade than i got.... and it worked! yehey!!! got a higher grade than i got!!! NOT! it didn't work at all... so i was a tincie-wincie-ittie-bittie-quarter-0.25-25% pissed off at that time.... so it wasn't that big of a deal.... then, we checked the AP tests... i got another grade lower than my expectation... "mataas ang pangarap ko"- quote from sherly's line in our bigkasan performance... so i was still a little pissed off... then, after time pitied me and began to speed up time, the bell rang.... then i thought, Oh My Golly Shet!(you see, i don't say those kind of bard words) biology subject is next! i got a really low grade... i hated myself at that time... hated myself more... this time, reality slapped me in the face, i should be sad- i said to myself... so i was sad... really sad... but i pretended to be HAPPY, shalalala........ corny.... never mind that..... after that, recess, nothing happened, then algebra, someTHING happened.... i got another low grade.... i didn't saw that coming....then, my theoretical-hypothetical imaginary other personality spoke to me.... "don't worry, you'll get 'em next time" yeah , i also thought that to myself.... but i still hated myself.... then, english, nothing happened, we just had an activity... miss yee gave us a situation that if we were in a plane crash, and the pilot and other passengers survived and we have to choose 7 things from the plane's left-over things... still this day sucked.... big time..... the only thing that made me happy was the fact that our bigkasan practice was a most productive day... we had nice actions for our song in the end....  malay ka na Pilipino, kagitingan mo'y isisigaw sa buong mundo... sa buong mundo...  that was half of the chorus of the song....  but all the same, my day was just like kurt angle.... it sucked.....  peace up, ryan here, signing out....
