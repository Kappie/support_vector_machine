Anyway... class was dull because I took the professor's research methods class before and it was pretty much the same stuff over again.  After class I went down to the Spectrum to make use of the Quicksilver gift certificate I got from wrestling. Man stuff is expensive there... oh well... I got myself a pair of shorts... a nice light pair with plenty of pockets... it'll be useful for when I go to shows. While I was at it, I picked up an  Anti-Flag  shirt from Hot Topic. I needed some new clothes anyway. I'm the type who doesn't get clothes unless I feel like I'm running out of clothes. This was about that time.  Time for lunch, a nap, and maybe some work on my paper before work...  **
