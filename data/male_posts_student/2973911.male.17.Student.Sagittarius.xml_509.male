P-chan, just a thought but listen to it sometime and tell me what you think of the song.   I'm getting a tad scared of the oncoming week. I'll be 20!!! Gadz! The dreaded time when I will be leaving the teenage years behind. Yes, it's totally senseless to worry about a change in years but this means that it's my last year in college and then I'll have to live on my own and cook for myself. I think that's the worst part. Having to cook for myself. Yes, I can cook but then, I'd have to actually be the one to budget just how much of my money will go to food and that's where my quandary is. I spend a lot of money on food!!!   And the jobs!!! I'd have to say yes to someone telling me what to do all the time. As much as I'd like to be my own boss, I don't really have any capital or profitable money-making ideas from my marketable skills other than my doubtful skills of shopping and being able to get a lot of people to do as I want them to with them thinking it's their idea.
