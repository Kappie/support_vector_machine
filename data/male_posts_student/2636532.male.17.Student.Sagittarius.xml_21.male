Recently on T.V, i saw National Geographics special on giant cats.  At the begining they showed the body of a six year old girl that was attacked and killed by a tiger as she and her parents were grooming it.  Is it just me, or does this seem really stupid to all of you? I mean, what are they expecting from a cat who's instinct is to kill things smaller and weaker then it? Did they think that the tiger would curl up in a ball at the child's feet and start purring? What the fuck? why are people so fucking retarded???  All this bullshit happens beacause people don't think! You have to wonder what was going through their heads right then.  It be something like this... "Dum dee dee, I'm a complete fucking moron, I'll just leave my 6-year-old daughter with this giant meat eating cat!" and to top it off for stupidity, there's a couple in Colorado USA that owns over 52 big cats and they regularly go into the cages and "play" with them.  Their view on big cats is that they shouldn't be handled by people that can't tell what the cat is going to do. Um...I don't know if it occured to them that these animals in general don't speak and don't exactly tell you anything.  Especially if these cats are attacking the fence right behind you, and i don't know about anybody else but i think it's just plain stupid to get in a cage with a snarling giant beast that would rip your head off in the blink of an eye, even more so if it hasn't eaten. I think people that are this stupid should be dragged out into the street and shot in the legs. then beaten with a frozen monkey.  All i know is that if i ever have a kid i'm keeping it away from those damned tigers. -Matt
