Usually when I'm on the Web, I'll hit all the major news sites and then some of the more obsure ones as well. Of course I ten to stick to technology news, but I have a wide range of interest (and a quite large sense of curiosity) that I'll read about almost anything news related. I believe being aware of whats going on in the world to be important and it's a great way to start conversations and break the ice.    I have a good friend who is in the Media trade as well, been meaning to get her to start her own blog because she's a great writer (I do hope she is reading this, she knows who she is *winks*). One of the things that I shared with her when she started her studies in journalism is that to always remember that media needs to have   Soul  . What I meant by this, is that every journalist or documentry maker, has a responsibility to the public to give an accurate view of the subject or topic. Not just an accurate view but a complete view as well. I believe that the media should not be telling people what to think or believe, I believe that the media should give a complete story for the people to decide for themselves.  While I can comment the American media on accurately portraying the emotions and horror of the 9/11 incident, I feel that they failed to give proper due to the "other" sides of the story. They may have the soul but they are lacking in depth.  However, other the course of the year, I have seen the media starting to "mature" when it comes to this topic. They have spoken of the devistation of the bombing on the country of Afghanistan and it's people. They have written of the knee-jerk response and treatment of the non-extremist muslims. While it may be too little, too late, at the very least, history will show that the event did indeed shake the whole world as the incident has been labeled, and not just one country, no matter what that country may want to believe. In fact I think that they should take some solemn pride that they have shown that when an attack that is against all that is good and just is done on one of us, it is done to all of us as a Race. We still have that faint unity and with it, hope.  Sleep well  >
