Well we jus found out we r playin west torrance ova at their place on tuesday. I heard they werent that strong but it all jus comez down to how we play against them. I guess right now its jus all mental cuz thatz the problem wit most of the guyz in our team. They try too hard and like try to make everything they do perfect, i admit i use to think like that but last nite i was soooo calm and confident, i barely made any mistakez. So hopefully jon'z knee healz, so that the 3 pronged attack can dominate once again vs. west torrance...payce.
