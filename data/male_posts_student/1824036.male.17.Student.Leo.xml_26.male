As of this writing, $300 seats that come with the commemorative chair in the first five rows are still available for purchase. Not good news for what usually is a hot crowd in Texas.  Drew check it out!!!! there are still seats available!! isnt this awesome! .....  ...... wait.... why is this awesome?  Hmmm I dont know, but if I had any chance what-so-ever to go to a WWE event I would because the atmosphere is awesome. Jeez, and I thought that Survivor Series was a big event!
