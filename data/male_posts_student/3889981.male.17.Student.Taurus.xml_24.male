It's not really pessimism - I think there have been so many people in my life that I have met and made a difference and I believe that it is time for them to stand out and be recognised.  Firstly, to the part I've been living in - Singapore has been a wonderful home. Yes, ERP, fines and whatnot, but hey, no catastrophes, no war - I'm well-fed, and I'm happy. Thank you so much for giving me the chance to grow and be a part of the culture here.  Then, a tribute to my parents - it's been seventeen years of utterly brilliant education, and most part from your patient teaching. Dad, the canings still hurt, but they will constantly remind me of what I should strive for and what I shouldn't. Mum, you may be 44, but every day I see you I know that my Dad has great taste. To date you are still beautiful to us and your cooking is fantastic as ever.  To my late grandfather - your disease didn't allow you to have a clear mind when you went, and I always blame myself why I did not give you the respect you deserved before you died. Before his struggle with Alzheimer's, he was a tenacious man who married a prominent member of one of the clans in Hainan. Wherever you are now, I hope you will forgive me.  To my primary school teachers - you raised a child who was deemed 'smart' but had 'much room for improvement', and probably you should have added 'incorrigible attitude problem' beside those remarks too. Thank you for all the guidance even when at times those advice you gave seemed negligible, especially Mrs. Ang B.L. and Mr. Michael Lim.  To my primary school friends - I express my warmest heartfelt gratitude to several classmates who have had to withstand my temper and bad behaviour, some for as long as six years. Leonard - who is still in contact with me - was my best friend in primary school and is still one of my closest buddies.  To all who have been mentoring me in Scouting in one way or another - I apologise for giving up on my pursuit for the Chief Commissioner's Award, and I know I wouldn't want to slip up on my last chance now. Ms Wong, you have been amazing in being the compass North in my life.  To my ex-classmates in 1E/2E/3J and 4J - how are all of you doing? It's been a long time since we had a class gathering. My fault that I didn't organise one earlier. It is impossible to name everyone since every single person has made an impact in my life, and not just the most vocal one (yes, Yuan Qing...)  To my current classmates in CG 12/04 in Temasek Junior College - live on and live your lives with passion, purpose and drive. Ms Lee, to be frank, I did not really enjoy your classes during the first three months of JC, but I have slowly grew accustomed and I have grown to respect and like you. You are a good civics tutor and you will thrive in teaching as long as they permit you to stay so.  Mr Chin, thanks for the snooker club and all the enjoyment that we had spending our spare time (and sometimes not) in it.  It may be too little for a letter, so at this point I pray you will forgive my anxiety to complete this; I just want to dedicate this to all who have helped me, and that I am sorry for not including their names in this letter.
