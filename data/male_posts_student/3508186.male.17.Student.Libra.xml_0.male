Then I ate lunch, did the dishes, and chatted with Kassandra (Bernard) for awhile.  Like I said, I'm tired, but I so wanna do something today.  I guess I'll have to call Josh and see what he's up to.  Maybe he's at work.  Can't remember.  I'll post some pics of my peeps as soon as I figure out how to work Hello.
