I was getting my picture drawn when it all started. O'well. It was a pretty good time after all up there. Our place of stay wasn't really considered a cabin, more like a house. Actually it was a house. I wasn't expecting that. Then we had the graduation party Saturday. First off we stopped at Cabaels on the way up. I picked up a rain coat there. Next it was the party. It was for my cousin's College Graduation Party / Family Reunion. All the family came up to see my Aunt Diane and Uncle Mike's new house. They used to live here in St. Marys then Mike got transferred to Michigan so that's how they got up there. I drove all the way home. It wasn't too bad. It took like two and a half hours to get home. Its crazy how in Michigan people go 80+ miles an hours. As you can see it didn't take very long.   I got a GMAIL account!!! So far it seems to be pretty cool. I must say I like the search feature. I don't think it will replace Outlook though. Give me a email at  urlLink ericville@gmail.com  to help test it out.   You are probably wondering why I am up so early. Well my alarm clock was an hour ahead. I am to go in to work by 9:00. My alarm was an hour ahead and I didn't even notice until I got there and wondered why nobody else was there. Can't believe I did that. Ha.   So there was my excuse for not blogging in a while. Vacation. It took me awhile to figure out how to get internet up there. I got it, but on a very limited bases. Actually my genus brain came up with the idea on how to get internet. I had to buy a 120 minute phone card from Wal-Mart. I used that to dial up the internet back at home. It wasn't that bad of an idea. That was the only way to get a local number. The speed was a fast the first time (45.5kbps) but the next time it jumped way down to 28kbps. As you can see that was way to slow to do really anything. I just thought the idea was genus though.   Well I think I might get some breakfast. I'm off to eat.  ++eric++
