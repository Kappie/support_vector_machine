Since then I've been blogging off and on, with many changes along the way, all of them I didn't really keep for a long time. Well, today that all changes.  The first foray into the world of blogging was with Blogger before I moved to West Virginia. Back then it wasn't what I wanted. I had aspirations for a really cool blog that  needed  PHP and such. So, like I said, I used my little iMac for that purpose. But now I've come to realize that a short web address, a permanent web address, and the new Blogger are what I need. If you are looking for a new weblog or are thinking of starting, I really suggest Blogger.  So welcome to my new weblog, where I will try more than ever to update at least once a day, if not more.
