I chickened out of talking to Christen and only exchanged a few pleasantries with her brother.  Technically, we were competing in different catagories but I think we got the same number of sweeps points, since LN is really slipping and LC is on the rise.  Oh, plus I got my bronze seal, which signifies my status as ubernifty speechifier.    On the halloween party:  I'm  really  tired.  It was great to see Hannah again, though.  Sorry I tried to kiss you, Soph, it's one of those sudden whims I get.  Who was that Andrew guy?  Does he go to LN or LC?  I've never seen him before in my life. I ate too much.  I'm going back to bed. SQ(u)EE!
