I don't know why my room is so hot compared to everywhere else, but it sure sucks.  The big news this week is that on Wednesday, the Senate will be voting on the Defense of Marriage Amendment. Now, chances are that this isn't going to pass, but I am still disgusted at the vile divisionary tactics the right uses. First, to write discrimination into the Constitution 220ish years after is was written is shameful. This is supposed to be a progressive country. Secondly, the motives behind this are pure politics. George isn't going to lose any votes that he already lost by trying to ban gay marriage, but Kerry might by supporting it. This is just the right's noise machine trying to cover up the  real  issues we care about in this election. If we are arguing over gay marriage, we aren't thinking about Iraq, the economy, healthcare, or corporate accountability.   It is about time that George learns that the White House isn't his bully pulpit, and he can't proselyze his religious views at us. The law of the land doesn't come much clearer than the words, "Seperation of Church and State." Not only is he disgracing our country, but his fellow Christians by only following the Bible as it fits him.  I am 95 percent sure that proselyze is a word, but I can't remember how to spell it.  I arose too late in the afternoon to do anything, and I wasn't really in the mood anyway. So I cleaned my room, which took a few hours, and complained about the heat. The high point of my day will be watching Lupin in a while.  I have to work tomorrow, sadly.   Well, I am done for tonight, as Lupin is coming on in a few minutes. Sorry, it feels incomplete to me.
