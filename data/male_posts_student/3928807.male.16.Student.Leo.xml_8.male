I thought I'd be more excited when I got it, but then again I can only drive with a G2 driver as my passenger. But maybe now I can start drivinga little bit. Sam didn't come with me because he wasn't ready- I will seriously be surprised if he actually goes without me.   In other news, tomorrow I have an interview with Earl Bales. Things are looking up for me, aren't they? With good news always comes bad news, because apparantly A.J's dealer fled to Iran. Perhaps it was for the best. Shit son, if I get a job at Earl Bales, my dad will finally get off my case. And Sam willbe jealous. And my parents will start saying "why can't you be more like Ben?" Hahaha.   Ok, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. But today after getting my G1 I feel alot more confident in acing this interview tomorrow. I know I can do it. Just like I made MacRadio.   It's 1:41 and I don't know what i'm going to do for the rest of the day.. I could call Cary but then we'd just end up playing Super Smash Bros. Melee and then watching T.V or something equally boring. Darren is at work. Harrison is at work. Don't feel like calling Andrew. Max is obviously at camp or what not.   Damn.. I need to make some more friends.
