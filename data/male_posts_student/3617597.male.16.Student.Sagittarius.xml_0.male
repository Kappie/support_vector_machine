I finally get out of my dump of a school and out into the real world (not YYAYY) I finally arent 'attached' to anyone or anything anymore so thats a kinna relief from things, and it means that i can do my own thing without offending anyone in the process. I dont know if i want to be in anykind of 'thing' at the moment and to be honest i just wanna have my own time to relax after 11+ years of bloody educamactaion (i spelt that wrong on purpose)  DaveXXX
