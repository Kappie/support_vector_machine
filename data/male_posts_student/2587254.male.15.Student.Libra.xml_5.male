Tomorrow....english exam but I'm not worried. it's english. But yeah today was spent as relaxing and just doing w/e I want. So yeah today I don't have much to write about. I feel like Strong Bad when he let The Cheat write his email that one time...  Well I woke up around 11 today.........wow........on a monday. Feels so good. Heehee no school. Feel sorry for Patrick. He had to write math exam today hahahahahahaha. Stupid 9er. Well anyways I called him up around 12 and basically from 12-3:30 we played NFL street. We got REALLY far. It was really fun too. We got further in 10 minutes today than we would have in 3 hours yesterday. We actually have a decent team too. I think I might buy this game. It's REALLY addictive. And it'll be my first sports game. Hmm....yeah not much else to say......  Daves family came......not dave or tommy but their family. They ate dinner here and stuff then left. I just practiced music and then studied. That's basically it.  See my day was pretty boring and relaxing today. Fit in SC, PS2 and studying. If only tomorrow were like this also...but NOOOO stupid english exam. Lates.
