Well anyway, my ex-girlfriend (since she broke up with me at like 11:55) told her cousin to call me this morning. Heather (her cousin) said "Hi, are you and megan still going out?" I said "Yeah?" she said " Guess again."  I said "No? why?" she tled me "She said that it's over." I was like " why?" then she said "She said that you always yell at her and she's you think she's supposed to take it and everytime she or Jesse hangs up on you, you get mad or whatever said yell and her and you always say 'f*ck you' or w/e "Most of the time when she hangs up on me I really don't care because I accidently hang up on people all the time and then only time I did get upset with her was when she hung up on me on purpose and I called her back and started talking or whatever and she wouldn't talk to me and then she started getting an attitude or w/e and I told the that she needs to get that log outta her @$$, because I didn't do anything to her, and I wasn't even yelling when I said that." And anybody that "knows" me knows that I have a rule that I never hit girls the only time I do is when sonya and I are playin around and I really don't even hit her.   And then Heather said that Megan said that everytime she calls me either nobody picks up or  I don't talk to her, and I was thinking * what he heck man* and then I told her everytime I call her she never talks and then she clicked over to talk to megan and megan said " well whatever it's still over"   But anyway I really don't care because I've to deal with break-ups alot in my life, although I've only been with three girls in my life. But anyway Sonya is going to Canada on like Friday so I have to spend as much time with her as I can.     But anyway I guess all those people that said our relationship wasn't gunna work were right.  But anyway I guess I'll get over it.
