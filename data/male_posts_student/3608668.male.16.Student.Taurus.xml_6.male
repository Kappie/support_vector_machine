Josh's great-grandpa's funeral was today. I didn't get to talk to him much today, but I love him so much! He and I plan on hanging out tomorrow. I'm not sure what we are going to do yet, but no matter what it is, I'm sure it will be great. I love being around him and I love everything about him. Tonight was pretty much like a rollercoaster ride. It was smooth at the beginning, but then it was all downhill from there. It started off with Carrie and I going to the mall. We were there for a while. We ate and talked and had a good time. Then we went to pick up Chris. He wasn't home like he said he was going to be. It kinda made Carrie mad, because he promised he would go with us and then he didn't. I really think that Carrie was kinda mad at me because of some of the things I said to Chris and about him. (I'm really sorry about that. I know you guys will work it out and everything will be ok.) Oh yeah, Chris found this street sign with my bf's last name on it. It's a pretty unusual last name, so I was surprised that he found it. I think he is going to give it to me. (I really hope so anyway.) Melanie got mad at me tonight too. I really wish that I could understand girls sometimes. I know that I'm not a "typical guy", but somethings about girls I still don't understand. Just so you guys know, Melanie is my favorite trick! We cruised Green for a while and then Carrie, Melanie and I came back to my house and sat and "talked" for a while. We didn't really do much talking though. For all you dirty minded people, NO, we didn't do anything. I like the cock! LOL. Carrie was pretty quiet after we left Chris's house. I could tell that she was upset. Well, I guess I will prolly write more tomorrow. Peace out homies.
