I saw a shop, actually two of them selling recent games for all platforms.(WOA!) Saw a lot of cool  Game Boy Advance  games, but nothing i was looking for. The other shop, it was different.  Unreal Tournament 2004 ,  Far Cry ,  True Crimes  and lot of other recent titles, i was amazed. Rest assured, i bought a game, altought not everything went well. I did'nt notice on the box that my 3d card was the only model that was not supported. It's sad, it's gonna cost me even more money to try  Splinter Cell Pandora's Tomorrow . It looks very good tought.   I also attended the  Fiesta De Juno  at school tonight. I met  Wanderley  and the  Japanese , eated a  Churros  and drank a bit of  Hot Whine . I also met  Barbara , she is cool. She was a bit sad that i left early, actually it was a bit boring.   Found the main song from  Kingdom Hearth , i have been listening to it in loop for an hour now.  Regards,  Zephyr
