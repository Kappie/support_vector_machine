First, I'll argue against the alternatives:  Alternative 1: Showering at home - This method involves walking home in either sweat-soaked clothes or causing a new change of clothes to smell because you are not yet clean.  Fatigue is a factor.  You want to get the the shower as soon as possible but the cooldown period between the last fast break and the first steps to your apartment can make the walk a touch exhausting.  Alternative 2: Not Showering - All the stuff from alternative #1, plus if you go to bed without showering your bed, clothes and entire room will smell like ass for days.  Or so I've heard.  The Ideal Way: Showering in the Locker Room - One must overcome any insecurities about seeing other men naked, but it's a small price to pay.  And hey, we're all guys, right??  I don't know if the ladies experience a similar thing, but I'd be happy to read (and reread...and savor) any accounts of showering in the women's locker room.  You know, just a gender comparison.  But regardless of one's sex, the heat of the water, the scent of the soap...it's a thorough cleansing that brings your exercise session to a satisfying conclusion.  I implore everyone who works out at the gym...don't bypass the locker room.  They provide towels not just for the weight machines.  They provide them to help send you home clean and content.
