With it we bought Halo and Topspin, a very good tennis game, as well as the DVD playback kit. After I was at work, Matt and Zoe snuck behind my back and bought the Sims Bustin' Out. It makes me sad that Hobester made a remark to me about it and less than 24 hours later it was in my posession.  A good Conan on tonite - not a rerun, a rare treat from that show. Jim Gaffigan is on there, which means its gonna be good.  Fable... sounds a whole lot like Morrowind. I can't distinguish betwixt the two as John tells all. I lost my enchantment with Morrowind for PC very quickly with the poor controls and lack of finesse in battle. Faster than I lost it for Neverwinter Nights with a mind-dulling repetitiveness, reoccuring each time in a different sheep's clothing. Not to mention a horridly over-inflated currency system. There's little I hate more than one of those.   The main Xbox game I'm looking forward to adding to my collection of 4, after of course Halo 2, is Blinx: The Time Sweeper. It's an exciting adventure about a janitorial cat who travels through time. I played a demo once and I love it. The sheer strategy of it allows for hours upon months of gameplay.  Currently, I'm liking Topspin, though it's potential for being a long-lasting favorite wanes. It can support 4 players, making a dubs tourney a definite possibility. With the high levels of customization, especially in the department of appearance, I've come up with the idea of recreating a number of the BHS tennis team onto the game, each with respective strengths and weaknesses. This decision was not a little spurned on by the fact that the very first character created bore and unintentional but eerily unsettling resemblence of Stanek. Oh well.  You got the way to move me. Ah, Neil Diamond, when will you ever stop rocking so hardcore?
