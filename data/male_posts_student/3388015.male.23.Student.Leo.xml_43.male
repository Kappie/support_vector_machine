I rushed to UR to find that even though I was late, I could still help out.  Laurel put me in the handicapped section to help people in wheelchairs.  When I arrived, there were already 10 people standing around doing nothing.  It was one stinking cold morning.  I wore my new shirt and tie from yesterday and my new boots (I find that they are one size too small and now I can't return them.. ugh, oh well).  I sat through the hour long ceremony. The CEO of Warner Brothers gave the commencement address, apparently he's also part of the board of trustees.  He was talking about all the WB's movies, shows, etc, etc and then got political.  While I agreed with him on almost every issue, it really wasn't the best time to be giving this speech.  It didn't relate to the graduates at all.  I'm glad my graduation was a bit better, even if they did ask us for money during the ceremony!  I went to the free brunch they offered and then went to Susan's ASL ceremony.  Very interesting and light hearted.  A bit less mellow than the Computer Science ceremony I had during my graduation. :)  I then went and found Sheila and her family and hung around them until the ceremony for Psych in Strong.  Very logn ceremony.. so many people in that department.  But it was nice and it was for Sheila. Except her father now thinks I'm her boyfriend.  He asked me about a ring?  Oh boy.  The Psych reception was in a really small enclosed area and I had to fight for a cookie.  Not my idea of a celebration, but whatever!
