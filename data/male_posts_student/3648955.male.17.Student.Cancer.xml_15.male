Lately ive been doing some attempts to fix my main computer due to its network failure. Thats what i get for using Windows XP Pro ;X. I really do not wanna format that comp and put something else on it, due to the fact that i have so many mp3s, movies and programs that i actually use and such. I would back it up, but its gigabytes of information. I did however partition the drive and put all my movies on the newly made drive which i made X:\. I might as well move shit to there, and overwrite the windows with a new installation of it, or change the filesystem and throw Gentoo on it.  Ive also had some goodish bad news lately. Im moving once again. Its not very surprising. I dont like this house anyway. I love the area, just hate the house. Its disgusting, its dirty and theres bugs all over. Its just yucky... Anyway, we're moving back to where i originally was and to an apartment. It wont be too bad though... i was told that over 60 people wanted the apartment and that all the floors are white marble. If over 60 people wanted it, then im sure its worth the $1600 a month rent. The house im in right now is $3500 a month and its not worth it AT ALL.  My birthday is also tomorrow. Im not so happy about that. Im never happy when its my birthday. Nothing ever happens. I get nothing at all. My mom today had to go to the dentist, so apparently i get nothing from my mother. My father is a loser with no job and likes to hit on women, so apparently i dont get anything from her. And my aunts and people like that im sure wont get me anything since no one really gives a shit about me or know who i really am inside.  Im just very blah. Thats the feeling. "blah". Im annoyed and i hate life. Life is annoying. People get chances and good parents and i dont get shit. I know that there are thousands of people who dont have those chances as well, but i contribute to the world, and i deserve it. I dont deserve bad treatment and/or no treatment at all. I havent even been to a doctor in years nor a dentist yet my mom can go to hers. Why was i born id like to know? What is the point of having a child if you do not plan on enjoying the experience and loving your child? I really do not see a point. Youd have to be real scum like Joan Crawford to have a child and just use them to just show em off. But i know for sure my parents arent like Joan Crawford. They arent famous, they dont beat us and they dont really show us off if you know what i mean. Everyone thinks of me as a weirdo i think. I dont think im really part of any family here. I always felt like the odd one out. Maybe im the only normal one, and they're all the odd ones out for a change.
