Hence i began spamming ppl with smses telling 'em that morning jog was cancelled..think my bill's gonna rocket sky high this month..soon ppl began bombarding me with messages..asking me why...and whether i could be trusted and stuff..lol..and omg..it stopped raining at 720..and yingquan ronald and some other peeps told me there was run...just that it would be held later cuz they wanted to wait for the area to sort of dry up...  man..i was panicking..not cuz of taking attendance or wat..just that i was in a dilemma..if i went to sch and ran and take attendance and others would i messaged didn't...it's kinda like i would be lying to them and stuff...so ah well...eventually i just went to sch..realising that some ppl i smsed telling them there was no sch...and they sorta said ok and stuff...were in school..so ahh...i got a ride to sch in mum's car...got there...angks told me not to go otherwise i would be punished by doing pushups...not that it's tough or wat..but he said i would be "killed"...zzzz. went to kah kee hall...realised that many ppl did turn up for the event..but i only spotted like less than 5 ppl from class there...lol..den aks asked me to go science block...didn't expect to see 8 of them there...i think..including ivan and kee guan..lol..ivan wanted to have breakfast at sim..trying to catch the 2 chuns and ang swimming..ahah..so 5 of us...vin me gj aks and samuel tried to sneak out of sch...and we were thinking of the best route...ahaha...den we made our way to hcjc..told em i wanted to catch juniors taking part in hcjc inv..so yeah i made my way to the canteen and spotted them...didn't really see who else was there cuz i wasn't wearing specs..haha..guess they're quite well prepared...clement yiann and galven all speaking..guess it went pretty well...haha..the 5 of us made our way to my house after that..lol..there wasn't anybody standing guard at the hcjc gate...  So well..kinda slacked till 11++ when vincent got back from sch after taking maths test...which ang had misplaced his and aik's test paper...and they had to re-do it..heard the "re-test" was really really tough...lol..ah den vincent informed me that ang said that he heard joseph tan saying thatrun was cancelledat 700...so of course he told me there was no run...then after that at around 720 he said there was run again..zzz....so well..ang said that there would be no problems so long as form teachers make no violent objections to our boycotting of the thing.hah!  off to cine later..wahh...met lotsa ppl there...coach kelv's sister...evelyn...went to have lunch at long johns..after we finished mr aks decided to hone his ice-shooting skills by shooting at the sparkians at the neighbouring table...he kept shooting and they didn't retaliate..but after a while they did..at pzh..lol.and pzh got damn pissed he just threw an entire ice cube at them cuz it wasn't him that shot em and he was the one that got hit...lol..and they stopped retaliating.hah.  met up with nic and got into the cinema..realised we were sitting in front of the sparkians and lots other chinese high guys in uniform.lol...didn't really try to recognise who they were..so just took my seat and just tried to enjoy the movie..critics really did not take a liking to the show...only giving it 2 stars and stuff..but woah..it absolutely surpassed expectations...probably cuz i wasn't expecting much...lol..it was a sensational movie...music composed by hans zimmer...a jerry bruckheimer movie...wah...it was really really magnificent...the battle scenes were fantastic..they could have provided alot more background info though...keira knightley came out too late!!!ahhh...the strategems used were impeccably timed...fantastic..just that i didn't quite like the end cuz 2 of my fav characters died..argh..shan't say who..you should check it out.. ;) i don't exactly like king arthur's face though...haha...he sorta had the face that resembled a person who was gonna kill a foe when the event was supposed to be grandeur and happy and stuff...lol...  left our seats after that and realised u-glen jun zhe and jonsng were all watching just behind us..lol..they came from literature symposium..waha...wat a coincidence...lol...off to pool later on...regained my form!!!wahaha...triumphed overvincent 4-1..and the reason why he got one rack was cuz i accidentally hit the black ball in...lol...i wouldn't mind another game some other timeaiks...i'll do much better this time...=]
