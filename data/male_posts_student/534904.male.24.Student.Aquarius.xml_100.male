It's about time we had some quality programming here, what with that Miriam bloke/sheila moving in with the Big Brother Season 4 household, and Channels 7 and 9 regularly showing complete crap, or moving their quality shows back and back, or even cancelling them in favour of the latest craze in shit TV.  Anyway, back on topic, tonight's film was  urlLink Lolita . I hadn't seen it before (along with most of Kubrick's work, I must admit), and I wasn't sure what to expect. Needless to say, I am amazed by this piece of work. No other director makes such a profound impact on me -  urlLink 2001 ,  urlLink Full Metal Jacket ,  urlLink Dr. Strangelove  and  urlLink A Clockwork Orange  all made me  feel different  after watching them somehow. The same goes for Lolita. The storytelling is executed with a grace and elegance that is missing in this day and age; at no point is the relationship between Humbert and Lolita ever clearly stated; it is told purely by implication. This may be as a result of the forced editing that Kubrick had to do, but it's still done amazingly well.  I look forward to seeing the rest of the Kubrick Collection. Well done to SBS, for having the courage to buck the trend and show us some real quality. It's just a damned shame that precious few people are going to be watching this, in comparison to the audiance of, say, Big Brother.
