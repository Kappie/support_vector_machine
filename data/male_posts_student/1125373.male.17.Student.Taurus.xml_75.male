I've used too many and I know I'm probably ended up on several hit lists for it - I'm sorry never really totally fixes everything - we all don't want to be the third wheel - girls do fish for compliments...but most of us don't receive many at all, and when we do we think they are kidding - boys love girls. girls love boys. cruel cruel cycle. - "can we just be friends?" actually can occur - boys are idiots. girls drop hints allllll over the place and they dont notice (even my hair lady said this) - sometimes the people you care about will be out of reach sometimes   ok kids...i know ive like totally done most of those things wrong but thats why i wrote them, with a little friend advice in there somewhere.   Your dreaded words of fire burn deep wounds into my soul. You laugh as the pain worsens within me. Why must you mock my existance when your life is worth no more than mine? Why must you force tears from my eyes? What do you want from me? Is my suffering not enough to your greedy evil? How dare you feed off my innocence. You cannot have me. May God save me from the demons of my past and lift me up. For I am not yours to keep.  ladeyda!
