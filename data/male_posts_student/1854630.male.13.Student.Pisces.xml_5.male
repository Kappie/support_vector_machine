The gig is up people, you're too old to cut the mustard," the mounted PA box crackled.  Our principal is always trying to use hip phrases to better connect with the students, so this 'mustard' reference wasn't too off the wall. I had accepted it, and so had most of the other students, but I knew what would be coming--  "Did he just say "CUT THE MUSTARD?" asked an overweight guy in front of me with a hearty chuckle. This is the guy who makes stupid jokes about anything that happens, anything that anyone says, and is the only one who laughs at his own jokes.   Yes, he said cut the mustard. You know what he meant, just drop it.   "No no," piped our teacher, an elderly lady with an odd vocabulary, always using words like 'slew' instead of 'bunch.' "'Cut the mustard' is an old saying used when the speaker wants to express the fact that someone is too feeble to make an incision in mustard, which  you all probably know is a soft material."  "Not MY mustard," the same guy retorted. "Mine's CHUNKY!" exclaimed with a Beavis-and-Butthead-esque laugh.  And that was yesterday.  Today was one of those uneventful thursdays. Tommorow is friday, but I'm not really looking foward to the weekend. My family is driving up to a family friends' son's Bar Mitzvah. We get back Sunday! I can hardly contain my excitement! Three fun-filled days of family, people I don't know, and I'm guessing there will be blintzes involved.  I have no idea how to spell blintzes. Oh well.
