Gave Han Lin a lift, only to be told to follow his example saying that he was so "polite". Honestly! Anyway, Tze Ern brought 2 more XBOX controllers so that we could play 4 player. Basically, the team with Tze Ern in it won everytime. Blame it on experience. In the end, all of us were competing for 2nd place. I am happy to announce that I was relatively successful. We also played table tennis(again), both doubles and singles. we played the singles tournament style and I won 2 lost 2. On the whole, it was a relatively good day.  On the holiday homework front, I have completed my geography project(my part of it anyway)and my ACE is now half done. How pathetic...however, I am looking foward to watching england vs prtugal on tv today. Cya soon!
