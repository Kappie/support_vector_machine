Felt like a college kid in some movie..  sitting outside and reading..  Kids always do that in movies but that was me today..  T.S. Elliot and a a beautiful day..  It was pretty good..  well I gotta call and get off work on sat because got a rush party sat then the KU game...  Hopefully I can get off on Fri too and go to the royals game with my boys too but that might be too much to ask..  Oh hwell  can't beat watching us beat the shit out of marquette and continuing on our road to a national championship..  Ok well in the memorable words of my boy Toms' "Live the Dream..."  Peace.
