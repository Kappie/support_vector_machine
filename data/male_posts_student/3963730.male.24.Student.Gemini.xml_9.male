And I have spent most of my free time since the exams (nearly 2 months ago) trying to finish my website.      The website is mostly done, and yet still a long way from being ready for release. At least I have managed to finish something at last with this blog.      I think I will have a break for a week, I haven't seen any friends in the chat for a couple of weeks now since I began these long days at Asda. I am just quickly on now to emailOdile's sisterSophie a happy birthday for today.      I am listening to  Roy Orbison - Mystery girl , which I haven't for a while since Odile. Funnily it doesn't make me feel as sad anymore. Just almost emotionless, I am not sure which is worse.
