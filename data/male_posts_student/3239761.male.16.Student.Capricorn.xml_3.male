All the teachers had their windows open totally breaking the new rule of it having to be "100 plus degrees" to open the windows. The administration needs a serious overhaul. Anyway, it was too nice outside when I left school today. It may have been that it was just Friday, but there was a great calm after school. After the first few seconds after I walked off the bus, I couldn't help but admire the beauty of the lawn... Now, normally dandelions aren’t that pretty or inspirational, but I just had to sit. There I lay on the front lawn, only about 15 feet from the road, but it was sooo nice. My backpack was strewn on the other side of me. I kind of lost track of time sitting out there. I was lying under the five year old tree in our lawn, and napped. It may have looked strange but you have no idea how good that feels after staying up all night, doing homework, reading, working, researching. My brain just quit, and it was the best feeling of yay you could ever imagine. I really think I need to do more of this, "not thinking" thing.  People take their front lawns for granted. We keep them nice and trim all year, but no one ever does anything with them. We don’t play on them anymore, they’re just something to look at before you get inside, away from nature, in our houses where we have lights and TVs and Computers to take our mind off of, everything. Now, I encourage everyone who is reading this to try something new; sit, enjoy your front lawn. No matter how small it is, enjoy what’s there. Its nothing drastic I’m suggesting, just sit. Now listen, to your neighbors mowing the lawn, wave to the people on the roads as they drive by. And have nothing to do. Whatever you had planned, watching TV, things to clean, these are all unimportant; just realize that no one is watching TV with you, and whatever you clean gets dirty again so let it be dirty for 15 more minutes. Breathe and enjoy life, everything was created for us, so why do we sit inside and die. And if you feel even more daring, lay on the grass, it’s not wet, there are no creepy crawlies, it’s just green and intimidating. And then, when you’re done with your adventure, you can go back inside and finish whatever you had planned.  ~~Peace
