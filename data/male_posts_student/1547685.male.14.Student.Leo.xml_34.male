We went to DC the first couple of days and saw all the monuments plus the memorials. Then we went to New York and saw a broadway play (Beauty and the Beast) and then went shopping. I stayed in the Double Tree hotel and the Embacy Suite hotel. They were both really nice and i have so many great memories not just at the hotel but on the bus/plane. Theres way too much to write about if i told you every little detail. All i gotta say is...yummy yummy yummy, free, free , free, take one, take one....lol so many good times. Lets see on friday my youth group had a joint meeting with CCCAC. It was really kewl and i hope to have another one some time.        This week was really busy... had/still have hw and test this week so thats why i havent had much time to do anything at all. On friday i go to Boomers for an all nighter so that will be a nice break. blog when i have time.........
