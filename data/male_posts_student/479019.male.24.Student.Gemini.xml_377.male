It's not brilliant and probably won't be memorable; however, all the cameos and some decent comedic moments made it entertaining. For example appearances by Vanilla Ice, Henry Rollins, Tommy Lee, David Hasselhoff and Jerry O'Connell were cool. I actually noticed some  Black Flag  graffiti on the wall of the prison cell where Luther and Dizzy stayed.  Also, Eliza Dushku wasn't all that appealing to me when she was on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Well, she was an appealing character in some ways, but in terms of looks. Anyway, she looked pretty good in this movie.  My plans for the weekend... although I never follow my plans... is to get readings done and bake some cookies.  ***
