I love that movie on so many levels....it has great music first of all...each song fits the scene perfectly....especially "Free Bird" when Jenny is on the ledge....some people don't like the little quirks with Forrest being involved with various historical events....I do!....but more than anything Forrest's unconditional love for his friends (especially Jenny) is what hooks me everytime....  All of the flawed characters he meets are taken in unconditionally by Forrest....he has concern for others that alot of my classmates would do well to notice....  The scene where he meets his son really gets me....but lately the scene where I'm apt to shed a few is when he's talking to Jenny's grave....  I love Forrest Gump....  In other news, it was discovered that I have a new channel, MTV Jams, that might actually be better than VH1 Soul....they show a good mix of Hip Hop and R like the old show Bill "I can't believe I get paid to be this bufoonish" Bellamy used to host....now all I need is the return of Video Soul with Sherry Carter and Donny Simpson on Prime Time....I can dream can't I?
