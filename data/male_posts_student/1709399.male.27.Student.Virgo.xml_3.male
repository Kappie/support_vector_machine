Microsoft   3.IBM  4.GE  5.Intel  6.Nokia  7.Disney  8.Mcdonald's  9.Marlboro  10. Mercedes                                      Some Interesting observations , 8/10 Brands are American (Except Nokia  Mercedes) . Coca-Cola Still retains its Position as the most visible Brand on the Planet . Was Surprised that Sony did not figure in the List .                                       Also did a simple "is it really Global?"  Test and found out to my utter surprise that In Fact I use in everyday life  6/10 Brands (Microsoft,GE,Intel,IBM,Nokia,Coca-Cola) listed and sparingly other two (McDonald's  Disney) .
