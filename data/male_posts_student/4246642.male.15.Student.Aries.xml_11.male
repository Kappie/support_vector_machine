He's probably got more like a dollar, not enough to ride the bus home. Oh he just said, it's $9862, okay, so we've LOST money  (-$137, which is a fair bit different to gaining some $5000 in a day) . Well done Geoff.  ________________________________  We're in the library right now, yes, so, um, yes.  Apparantly, two wongs don't make a white. Nick wanted everyone to know that. Geoff is going on about some portfolio, apparantly it started at $10,000 - now we're at $15,130.30c in ONE DAY! That's pretty cool. Oh, apparantly they are "his" shares. But, bleh. :P  If Geoff can figure out how, i'll put a photo of the graph up.    urlLink     Okay, there we go...  Wow, I have to do my Science assignment when I get home... we have so much to do, but then we get our Ski trip, so it's okay.  Apparantly the coke costs $2.50 a can. So, yeah, start saving. Also, it's 7 months and 4 days till my Birthday. (It's so closer than your crappy 1 month Sian!)      This gal, is apparantly (well, firstly, female) and secondly, named "Courtney McCool". I found this on Yahoo. So, here's a plug for Yahoo. McCool.       urlLink     Bla, bla, bla, someone just called me a Fruitcake. :(
