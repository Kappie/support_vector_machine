I know that on South Park they can say "asshole" without the "hole" part bleeped out. I'm a Vh1 fanatic, if nothing's on I watch Vh1, on "I Love The 90's" they would bleep out small innuendoes like "inserted" or "sucked", and they even bleeped out "hard", when describing a "hard" penis during an erection caused by Viagra. That's why we have ratings, like South Park being MA-TV. I figured out that the censors just don't give much a fuck about MA-TV. They bleep out "fuck", "dick", "cock", and other stuff like that, which Blogger doesn't like. So what do we have to say about censorship and the FCC?                                                       FUCK YOU, YA CUNTS!
