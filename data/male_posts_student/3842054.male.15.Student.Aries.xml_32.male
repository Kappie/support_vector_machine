So last night we were partying at the Ross's house. The Ardells came over, it was my brothers and me, the Ross's, and Joe. We had fried chicken and just talked and hung out, then the Ardells went home and we all went into the pool. Rhonda wasnt very happy at 11 oclock at night when we were screaming at the top of our lungs and playing chicken fight.  School was cool yesturday. I have 4 homework assignments.
