Every time i hear it i wanna get up and dance some funky old jazz dance where i'm all hunched over and throwing my arms and legs out. It's almost enough to make me pick my trumpet up and try to re-learn how to play it.  Maria's birthday is soon, and i'm not sure what to give her. I was thinking about drawing a dolphin(she loves dolphins), but im not talented at all at shading, and i dont have what i need to do a watercolor or some impressionistic thing. I dont just wanna get her something impersonal like a cd or something. Ideas would be appreciated...  gosh, it's taken me like, twenty minutes to write this much, lol. not feelin it tonight. I think im in the mood to write a poem or something, so i'll cya later....
