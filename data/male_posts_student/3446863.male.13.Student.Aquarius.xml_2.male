I've not met my other (less nerdy) friends for a pretty long time now... (i.e. if 1 month is considered long)...  Spoke to my computer science professor, Mr. Santhosh this morning, I feel really disgusted calling him a professor though... He is a real pal. I just instructed him to go through the Hardware Books I gave him (yeah "I instructed") =P  Oops, I almost forgot to tell you... I'm upgrading from my Intel Celeron 1.7GHz to a Intel Pentium 4 3GHz with HyperThreading.... YAY!!! I'm so excited, I just can't wait for it to arrive =)  Coming back to the subject (that is - the blog title), I spoke to Microsoft Employee indirectly (through Santhosh) and he actually asked me to concentrate on the .NET Framework 2.0 and Longhorn and haven't I told you? I'm also a GREAT Artificial Intelligence supporter... I'm working on Neural Networks, Natural Language, Fuzzy Logic (Emb. Systems) and they're all great to learn about.   I just tried overclocking my current processor from 1.7GHz to 1.9GHz... Seems to be working fine (atleast till now)  And in a picture post, I'm going to be showin' you a pic of me...  Its 12 15 PM, Noon and I'm hungry so I guess I'll finish lunch and post those pictures...  Okay then, Bye for now! Tom!
