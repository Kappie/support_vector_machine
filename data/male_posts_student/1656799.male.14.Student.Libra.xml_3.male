What I've done to others and what I could of done to avoid doing that, it seems such a shame that I can't turn back the hands of time and just put things right. But even so, if I did do that a new consequence would commence, and the end result may be more catastrophic. I've tried not to think about it all too much as I'll end up thinking I'm worthless and, but then I said something to myself in my head that seemed so god damn simple and true as well, that I couldn't really feed bad about stuff which has happened in the past.  "Consequence is inevitable."  Yeah I know it sounds a bit like, "For every action there is a consequence" but it feels different somehow.  Now thinking about it again reminds me that of course, you should say this to yourself if you wasn't really a direct cause of something happening, so don't fret about what you could of done to stop something happening.  I'm trying not to think of anything negative at this moment of time to oppose this, but I'm sure I'll eventually find a loophole in my sentence and try and forget it.  I think for now I'll stick to the maxim, "What is in the past should stay in the past."
