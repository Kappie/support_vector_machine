Funny how people who grew up under tyranny seem to have a better grasp on what needs to be done to fight it.  Quote - "The situation is worse in the Muslim world. Calling the terrorists 'militants' or 'radical Islamists' presupposes the existence of moderates willing to confront the radicals. Outside of Turkey, it is very hard to find moderate clerics who will stand up to Islamist terrorists, even though the majority of their victims are Muslim. In Iraq, Muqtada al-Sadr has been murdering his religious opposition and using armed gangs to establish political rule. He appears immune to anything resembling condemnation. We know that his militia receives outside support--and where would it come from other than Syria and Iran? "
