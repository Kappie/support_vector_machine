He explained that, given the millions of votes cast, no one individual vote matters.  I later took the same class myself, and had to admit the point made sense.  But I’ve never been entirely comfortable with it, and I don’t think it’s merely because I want to believe that my vote matters, although I do.  My suspicion is that the answer is both no and yes.  Anytime there are at least three voters involved, two of those votes won’t matter.  The only vote that matters is the third vote, the one that breaks the tie.  The other two voters, especially if they always oppose each other, might as well not bother voting at all, and give up their voting power to the third party, since it is that party which always decides things anyway.  Thereafter, the third party, now the only voter, decides everything, and can even do things the other two don’t want to do.  So, the other two votes do matter, acting as an invisible check on the tiebreaker.  Let’s try another example.  Suppose Tom is a pilot in the RAF in World War II, during the Blitz.  There are hundreds of German bombers flying to attack Britain: it does not matter how many he shoots down, most of them will get through.  At most, if he is extremely good and extremely lucky, he might shoot down three or four bombers.  It is not in his individual best interest to fly the missions.  He has a good chance of getting shot down himself, or killed; he will not stop the bombers, and he will not save his hometown, or any other British town, from being bombed.  His vote does not matter.  If all the pilots follow this logic, none of them will fly, the Luftwaffe will destroy the RAF, the Wehrmacht will invade England, and all of the pilots will be sent to Stalag Luft 3.  So, it is not in their self-interest for no one to fly.  Actually, the best outcome for any RAF pilot is that he himself not fly, but everyone else does.  If everyone understands this, it would lead to the absurd situation of every pilot encouraging every other pilot to fly, while excusing himself (this is where the sergeant says, “Enough B.S. boys, time to turn in.  Anyone not on the flight line at 5am will be on latrine duty for a week!).  The individual actions do not matter, but the aggregate actions do matter, making the individual actions matter.  Or does it?  Much more to follow, but please contribute comments.  I’m working this out as I go…
