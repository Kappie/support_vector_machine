But breathing’s tough when I’m  Eight feet under and sinkin’ fast. My blood is beginning to permeate Just like I said. Wondering what’s goin to happen When blue skies bleed red.  I close my eyes And see your face So I open my eyes, Beginning to erase, And trying to disguise The pain that hides  Inside of me, When I close my eyes.  Tell me something. If I am smiling, Am I happy? Or could it be a cover? There’s something left to discover. I’m hiding something under my skin It’s not something that’s coming It’s something that’s been.  So I close my eyes And see your face So I open my eyes, Beginning to erase, And trying to disguise The pain that hides  Inside of me, When I close my eyes.  Maybe I’ll spill over tonight; Stain this floor with blood Right now seems like a good time to fly Right up and out, Way up past the blue sky. Leaving the pain so far behind But once again I’m blind To the fact that this won’t solve anything  But if I close my eyes And see your face Will I open my eyes? Begin to erase? And try to disguise The pain that hides Inside of me, Or will I bear on and kill  This pain that eats at me?    here ends the love making session
