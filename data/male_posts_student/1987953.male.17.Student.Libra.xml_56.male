Graduation is only four months away! What the heck??? Why can't it just be June 3rd? I'll graduate, get my car, and get the heck out of here!!!!!   Here's the funniest thing I've seen in a while:   The winners of the David Letterman Top 10 Contest:  Top Ten Signs You're Eating Too Much McDonald's...    10. You accuse your wife of cheating when you see her coming out of Burger King Ray H., Newark, DE   9. You develop a bad case of "apple pie lung" Tim S., Council Bluffs, IA   8. Your blood type is "extra fancy" Erik L., Seattle, WA   7. Meals at other restaurants are never "happy" enough for you Steve S., Vancouver, BC   6. You volunteer for Mayor McCheese's re-election campaign Denver C., Annandale   5. You attempt to make a citizen's arrest of the Hamburglar Jim S., Raleigh, NC   4. You're unable to make a decision without first asking yourself, "What would Grimace do?" Ben S., Spring Hill, FL   3. The McDonald's sign in your town says "Over 8 billion sold to Al" Chad S., Coralville, IA   2. You think that Janet Jackson's starburst nipple shield should be a "Happy Meal" toy Lisa R., Hanover, PA   1. Swollen McNuggets Lou G., St. Louis, MO    Well, I eat at  urlLink Wendy's  all the time, So I would never know about that. I work there, so I eat there. They have the best food. The best burgers, the best fries, the best chili, the only potatoes. It's great!  Anyway, what's going on? What music have you been listening to? I have been listening to the Randy Travis Worship and Faith album. All those who like his country music, you would be blown away by his country worship!!!  Anyway, I have to go. I am in the Computer lab right now for Contemporary Issues class right now, and the substitute keeps yelling at me for slacking off (I am just tired of school work!!!) and I guess I have to go. I will blog tomorrow afternoon. All my friends, especially those at BLS, I miss you all! E-mail me soon!  In Christ, Mike >  Also visit:  urlLink Four Cool Guys
