I'm going to arrive about 2 hours early just in case everyone decides to arrive early like me. This is the climax of my life, if the humans win, I'll be happy forever, if the humans lose, then I'll end up going on a  massacre killing everyone I see, and then commiting suicide. It's obvious the humans will win. It was weird, some random FBI thing popped up on my computer screen just before, it shows maps and pictures and shows the training scores of some Agent Castle and he's inhuman, his physical activities are way above normal, he's a machine. Agents! THE MATRIX IS REAL! Oh god, that's all I care about right now is the god damn Revolutions. I won't be able to pay attention in school tomorrow, haha. Ok lemme say what happened today. No school, election day or something? Fun band practice, Chris R, Matt B and Bill came over to play frisbee but we were jammin so they just listened to us. Pat got dressed in a million layers of clothing and then we beat the shit out of him and now my hamper is filled higher than my furniture, it's awesome. Actually, it reaches the window. We came up with an original and invited Matt Kaiser into our band because we need a back-up basic tune, yal meeen? I got the new POD cd, it's awesome and it comes with a PS2 game thingy but unfortunetly I don't have PS2. But most of you guys do so I'll use you all. Oh god, Neo's gonna die. I know it. He's gonna, they even freakin show it in the trailers! I'm afraid of what's going to happen. After the movie, life is gonna suck because there's no more, it's all over, there's no matrix's coming out after this. This is it, hence the slogan "Everything That Has An End, Has A Beginning." There's no more thinking of WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN NEXT? But at least I'll be able to live my life in peace not worrying about what happens. What I'll be dying to see next is The Lord of The Rings: Return of The King and...Star Wars Episode III, that's going to be insane. It's going to connect the old to the new movies. It'll be tough for Lucas to do it but it's coming out in 2005 so I guess it wasn't that hard. Ok right now I'm procrastinating so I don't have to do my god damn AP Euro that's extremily boring and is on gay Louis XIV and absolutism. Who the fuck cares, I shouldn't have done AP...it's too hard and stressful. Ok, I gotta do it now, later...and next time I'm writing in this blogger, I'll be a changed man...a changed man...a changed man.
