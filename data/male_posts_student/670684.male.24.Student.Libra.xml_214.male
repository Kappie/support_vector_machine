Ben, the contagiously excited TA on staff, took a sheet of paper and answered it along with the kids.  The other staff members whispered and made less-than-emergency level comments that could wait for other venues.  I sat, watching the kids, looking over who was shedding their protection and opening their inefficiencies for public display.  A few did.  Many did not.  One girl did, but often looked to see if I was noticing her deliberation.  15 year olds trying to work their moves are funny.    Anyway, I'm answering the question.  It's silly, but fuck you, even though I'm basically a fairly well-read nihilist, often I can get inspired.  It's the folly of life...a cultural nihilist who wants to save the world.  And Noah Bopp was inspiring.  They make bad movies about people like him, only because no one can capture the energy like Noah does when he teaches.    WHO DOES ROLIN MOE WANT TO BE FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS?    I want to be compassionate.  I want to be a good listener.  I want to get to know all of my students.  I want to be firm when necessary.  I want to be firm when my fears want me to keep quiet.  I want to work hard.  I want people to enjoy their time.  I want people to feel comfortable to talk to me about anything.  I want to learn.  I want to be as excited as I am today every day.  I want to be sad when the kids leave.
