I've been in a better mood since i've taken the pills more regularly plus my therapy. I've been reading a little book coping with stress that my therapist gave to me. I'm not even halfway done cause I try to get away from reading since it is way too boring for me. Plus I keep waking up early in the morning even though I go to bed at 11pm-1am. Then when I wake up im bored and hot and cranky and not sleepy. Why the hell is it happenin'? I see my therapist this friday at 10.00am. It's been getting better for me since I haven't been so nervous around her since she's really understanding and doesn't seem to judge. I'm watching Will and Grace. Karen is the funniest! Gonna go bye
