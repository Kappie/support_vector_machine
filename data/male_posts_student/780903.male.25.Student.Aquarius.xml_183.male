I'm finding there's a way to do these things --   Step 1: find a good study guide and read it to make sure there aren't any big gaps in your knowledge Step 2: find a good commercial outline and steal their structure and main category headings, along with the black-letter rules, deleting the parts you didn't cover and aren't responsible for Step 3: go through your class notes and beef up the commercial outline where appropriate with policy, clarifications, etc Step 4: find some old outlines, comb through for some extra stuff you don't have, or sections they've done better than you've got, and add it in Step 5: read through and cut any redundancies out  And, voila, I've got a workable and complete outline.  Or at least I hope I do...  anyone have a better way to do it or see something I'm missing??
