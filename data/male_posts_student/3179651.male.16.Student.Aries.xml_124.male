Bean is in some random place in Maryland... Fun. I'm stuck in the burg.  Bean, do you want to plan a trip to DC or Nagshead for a weekend maybe?  I am saving for my $1,300  camera, along with a UV filter for it and Nikon Capture 4.1. Overall, this will cost me around $1,450 with shipping. Then i have to insure the Bitch on the rents homeowners insurance in case i drop it. Not good.  It is a sexy Camera. The Nikon D70.
