On the way, we passed by some classes and my friend started switching off all the ceiling fans that were still on in the class rooms.   "Why are you being such a saint?" I asked him.   "Because" says he, "I may look like a bad person, but I'm not."   That really got me thinking, and I began asking myself if I am who I truly think I am. Do you think I am being myself?   During Moral period today, we learnt a new "Value" called  "Taat Setia Kepada Raja Dan Negara"  (Loyalty to the King and Country) which I thought was total bollocks. Really, really, total bollocks. But I won't state the reasons here, for fear of being found out and getting myself into deep shit.   I'm having the sniffles and a headache now, due to a lack of sleep.    I hope I get well soon!
