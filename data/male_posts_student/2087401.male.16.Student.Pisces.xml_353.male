Also, I'm going back to my old title scheme with slight modification.  Songs from musicals, names of musicals, and quotes from musicals.  It will not change again. And the good news.  This is the last braces wire I'll ever wear!  April 7th they come off for good! JournalCon was fun, but you could be having sex with Yoko Ono right now!  And compared to that....  I still prefer JournalCon.  Definately.
