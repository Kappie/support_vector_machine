My apartment finally has hot water....I think....I wouldn't know for certain because the dude came at 2:30 and I had a class at 3 and I got in the shower for a second and it was warm and then cold....now it could be that the water heater needed to warm up....I'm not certain....but I do know this....there will be one unhappy Killa Cal if this shit is lukewarm and not steaming, burning my superficial layer of cervical fascia when I hop in there in saaaaaaay 20 minutes....  In other news....I have officially hooked up my apartment.....got the sweet 5 disc DVD changer that plays MP3's and also the sony home entertainment system....found The Godfather Collection at CD Warehouse for $50....came very close to buying a digital camera....still might buy it....now if I could work on my interior decoration....  Ummmm this weekend was interesting....I had some people over Friday....you could call it a party as there was alot of liquor and I danced a little....but I had to kick these 3 chicks out....I got drunker and the rest of the night is a blur....Saturday my digital cable got turned on and I watched it all day....worked out a little....ate....Sunday my good friend and former roommate Crystal cooked for a few of us and my friend Tony came into town....I studied with my classmate Heather and called it a night....this is what goes down OFFICIALLY as an A plus weekend for Killa Cal....anytime I get a fresh, home-cooked meal and get to kick someone out of my new domicile in a three day period as well as watch over 200 channels of BS it is a good weekend....  Finally.... urlLink Morehouse ....Dear ole Morehouse....my alma mater....are the  urlLink SIAC  (wack ass page probably hasn't been updated!) champs in football and are going to the Pioneer Bowl....this is a great thing....Killa Cal will be there!....
