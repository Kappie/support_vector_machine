Impressions others try to change, to impress. but how can you be friends with another, identity. not your own? Impressions, they wither your conscience, intelligence gets wasted, on matching, accessories. Impressions Someone may be a clown, yet crying inside. You only know someone  when they let you inside thier sacred soul. Impressions.
