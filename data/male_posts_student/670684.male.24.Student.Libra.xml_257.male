Documentary about a man's search to find Dow Mossman, regarded as one of the greatest young writers of the 20th Century in a New York Times review of his 1972 book  urlLink Stones of Summer .  His book vanished a year later, and he never wrote another novel.    Roger Ebert  urlLink sets it up  fantastically, as he usually does...the only movie I haven't agreed with Ebert on in recent memory is  urlLink Dead Poets Society , a movie that I can honestly say I enjoyed much more then as opposed to now.  Of course, I used to think  urlLink St. Elmo's Fire  was one of the great American Cinema Classics.  Anyway, the film meanders, and an easy 20 or 30 minutes could be cut, but at the end you don't really care, because you hit the meeting point, you get excited, and the interaction doesn't let you down.  Neither does the re-release of Mossman's  Stones of Summer , scheduled for September 2003.  Until then, I was inspired to buy  urlLink Call It Sleep , the great lost book of the 1930s.
