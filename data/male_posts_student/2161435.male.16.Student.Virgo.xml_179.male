Well, guess what I've heard! A new Charlie and the Chocolate Factory film! The old one is rubbish.. In this new one, Johnny Depp stars. Hurrah! We like him. He acts like some kind of good actor or something. Tim Burton directs! Sha-pow! Do I think it could be a good film? Yes. It could be the best film ever if the A-Team appeared though. "I'll just have a glass of milk, foo'" AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA DO YOU SEE? MR. T!  Ahem.  What other films... I look forward to The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy too. It looks like it'll be good maybe if possibly it works just a little bit well.  Shaun of the Dead is your god. It is quite possibly one of the best films I've ever seen. Though the Matrix still has a special slot in my heart.  Bruce Almighty should have been better. (They used up all the good jokes in the trailer really..)  Hannibal is fucking weird. (Puffy men and people eating their own brains.. You tell me that that's a normal film..)
