Im almost there... I  will  have it be the time Spring Vacation gets here.... today, my teacher was talkin to us about not assuming things about others, and she was asking/guessin what our cultural backgrounds were, and what "group" we fitted in... and she called me gothic... and I laughed at her.. cause Im not and stuff... the best part was that I told my friends that she was gonna end up callin me it about 5 minutes earlier... but thats ok, I've gotten overly used to the fact that people call me that... I mean, I do wear all black, but that doesnt mean shit ya know? lol..... alright, well, I gotta look into how much money I need so I can improve my computer...   later  Jerry
