And we need female counterparts to our posse. Damn. See, today Carver and myself were feeling quite lonely when the posse that consisted of Rei, Brent, and two other tall geekish guys who are kickass at lazertag were off chillin. We felt like shit.. well, speaking for myself at least. Why doesn't Rei talk to me?!? I love her so much... but she is always preoccupied with someone else. I guess I'm just not terribly interesting to talk to... I wish I was. I wish I could say fuck DDR and go hand out with people I like. But the problem is... I dont like people. A lot of the time I'm with someone, or just alone, and I say, "wow. I really fucking hate this moron" and ... yeah. Stuff gets boring. I need to find some skills that I can actually use in the real world. Or just get perfect at DDR. I guess I'm headed for the DDR based goal right now. ... Fridays shouldn't suck.
