But crap, i want to do well for PW, so i guess i gotta work for it. I'm so not in the mood for work........ Can't believe it. On one hand, i'm glad Sat has come, but on the other hand, soon it'll be sunday, and then Monday would be coming round again......... I miss myBPS days so much, the sick humour, the teasing,theclose companyand most of all the carefree feeling. AJ is nothing compared to those days.
