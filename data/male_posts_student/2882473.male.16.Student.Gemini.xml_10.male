I've just seen the Spiderman MTV spoof, failry good, but no where near as good as the Matrix one. Also Steamboat Willie is quite good. I really should go and learn my German vocab. but over 300 words...hmmmm, nah. Oh yes, I should also revise for a business studies test on International trade in Europe.....*snore* bugger that.
