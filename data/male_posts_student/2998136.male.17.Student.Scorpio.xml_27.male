The taller he stands, the bigger his little man.   (b)  HIS HANDS . The relative size of his fingers reveals that he's potentially a sexual winner.   (c)  HIS BUTT . The perkier his rear, the more skillfully he can steer.   The answer is (b): Men whose ring finger is longer than their index are especially fertile and frisky, according to a recent study. "  Such men tend to have higher levels of testosterone and produce more sperm than men with shorter ring fingers,  " says study author John Manning,Ph.D., a researcher at the University of Liverpool, in England.   Why the weird link?   The same genes that tell the finger to grow in utero also direct the growth of his family jewels:   Larger testicles produce more testosterone and more testosterone increases sperm production   - and jacks up his libido.   Other tip-offs? Check out the length of his index finger when he makes a gun with his hand:   The distance between the thumb-finger crease and his fingertip roughly correlates to the length of his mighty   (or not so mighty) member, according to research from Boston University.   Guys, after reading this, never anyhow point your fingers in the public again, you either get wow or boooooo .... before you take your risk, check it out at home first.
