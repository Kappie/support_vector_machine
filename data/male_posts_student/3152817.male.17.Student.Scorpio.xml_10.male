American'"    Unnamed Liberal: alright now...i know we don't agree on politics and that's fine...but that shit about the UN not going into Rwanda was a direct result of what happened in Somalia   Ok...I'm not quite sure why it's ok to try to help the people of one African nation (Somalia) while letting the other (Rwanda) become a living hell.    Unnamed Liberal: the US went into Somalia thinking they could save the world, only it backfired when they went in with out notifying the UN and had to get the UN peacekeepers to save our ass   Clinton did one of the few good things in his presidency when he went into Somalia.  Personally I think we got a bit too involved but someone had to help those thousands who were starving to death each day.  We got into a mess when a black hawk helicopter was shot down by Somalia militia (watch "Black Hawk Down" for the story).  We needed the UN peacekeepers to help us.  I didn't say they were  all  bad.  Just most of the time.    Unnamed Liberal: and the key word is genocide Unnamed Liberal: they called the whole thing in Somalia genocide but not Rwanda for a reason Unnamed Liberal: no one would send troops to Rwanda even if they did call it genocide   Again, what makes Somalia in any greater need than Rwanda?  Both had hundreds of thousands of innocent people starving and being shot daily.  How does the UN distinguish between two nations misery?    Unnamed Liberal: and before you start critzing the UN...u should learn how it works   I'd love to hear this sometime...    Unnamed Liberal: its sad that all you republicans think that the US can rule the world   Wouldn't it be great if the GOP did rule the world?
