So there will be more for the next little while, along with the usual randomness, and they will hopefully get consistently funnier and better.  Last night as I was falling asleep I scrawled down a few ideas.   Excerpts from new FOX shows featuring Simon Cowell as judge   "Birthing Idol" [Lights up on a woman in labor, pushing and screaming.] SIMON: I just don't like the head on this one. SIMON: I've never seen anything so dreadfully ugly. SIMON: That was a dismal performance.  And your gown is hideous. SIMON: You're bloody covered in blood.  Awful. SIMON: One baby is simply not enough to win this competition.  I'm sorry. SIMON: A boy, a girl, and a sandwich.  This is what this competition is all about.  "Homeless Idol" [Lights up on homeless people.] SIMON: You stink.  Quite literally, you stink. SIMON: I wouldn't give you a nickel for that performance, I really wouldn't. SIMON: That performance makes me want to find all of the other homeless people homes, because there's no way any of them can actually be worse than you. SIMON: Your box isn't even staying together. Pathetic. SIMON: You are literally freezing to death.  This is what Homeless Idol is all about.  Congratulations.  "Simon Cowell Judging the Special Olympics" SIMON: That was special.  Specially horrible. SIMON: If your IQ were any lower, you'd be Paula Abdul." SIMON: Did you really come here thinking you were the best handicapped child in the country?  Because if you did, then maybe you're in worse shape than it seems. SIMON: Can't walk?  Forget it.  You're awful. SIMON: You are drooling on my shoes, but you have star quality.  YOU are a special child.  "Simon Cowell at a Nursing Home" SIMON: Shouldn't you already be dead? SIMON: I just aged ten years waiting for you to get out of the bathroom.  Eighty more and we'll almost be even. SIMON: I hope you're close to the end, because otherwise that was just terrible. SIMON: I've seen better talent in the morgue. SIMON: No teeth?  But you can sing regardless?  You are why this TV show exists.
