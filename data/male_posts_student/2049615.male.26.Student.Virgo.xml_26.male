If you asked me to recount for you what the weather and temperature has been here in Bloomington for the past few weeks, I doubt I could do so accurately.  All I can remember is the heat and the sunlight.  Today was another day just like the ones before it:  bright, washed-out, and anodyne.  Already heat is starting to radiate from the macadam.  Now, at night, it's better, but my apartment is still suffused with heat.  If it were winter, and it were just the inside that were like this, it would be "cozy".  But it's everywhere, and it's inescapable.  This is the hottest place I have ever been to for longer than a day that is not also a desert;  while I expect that the farther south one goes from here the foliage becomes even more overpowering, I myself remain disconcerted by what I found here already in late March.   The milk-white flowers that grow on the trees that blanket the area drop their petals at the slightest breeze, so even in this still air the sidewalks are littered with them.  All around these flowers is the revolting smell of an overgrown algae bloom, but the flowers are not the source.  The city planners of Bloomington are kindred spirits of the geniuses who brought us New Orleans, Venice, the Uzbek economy and the Three Gorges Dam;  downtown Bloomington rests in large part  over  the Jordan River, which is visible only far outside of town, and on the IU campus as a shallow, inconveniently-routed creek.  It was claimed to me that the river actually flows in a manmade subterrenean channel through the city.  Probably, the river is carrying agricultural effluvium-enhanced algae downtown, where it clots in the sewers and breeds.  The Jordan River itself is of course named for the Jordan River to be found in the Near East;  like so many other sites within the pre-Civil War pale of Anglo-Welsh Protestant American settlement, Biblical toponyms are borrowed haphazardly, sometimes without regard to the original connotation of the name.  Possibly the people who chose these names were attempting to reinforce their connection to a religious tradition, which they saw as more immediate and relevant to their lives than contemporary events;  possibly they thought that recreating the Israelites' "Promised Land" in metaphorical fashion would highlight nicely their own claim to new land.  Oddly, Central Illinois, with its Cairo and Mahomet, would stand in for medieval Egypt, but the mainstream of the trend is for towns and geographical features like the Jordan River, or like Goshen, Bethlehem, Hebron, or Nineveh, Indiana.  With Southern Indiana's prophesied plague of cicadas currently the subject of much idle speculation, it is easy to suspect that Indiana's Bible-believing elders might have pictured themselves as in a way actually living in a Biblical era.  The other Jordan river empties southward into the Dead Sea near Qumran and is shared by Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan.  In Bible days, the Jordan was used by two Caananite groups, the Philistines and the Phoenecians, both of whom were noted for the worship of a half-man, half-fish divinity called  urlLink Dagon , or Baal-Dagon, who was supposed to live variously in this river, or in the Mediterrenean Sea.  While the River Jordan figures prominently in Judaeo-Christian mythology as well, the chthonic character and overwhelming smell of this new Jordan River reminds one that  urlLink speculation  as to the origin of the Dagon legend is occasionally  au courant .   ADDENDUM:  In honor of this flat, static weather, This is not a Fugazi T-shirt is sponsoring another giveaway.  The first five people to write to  urlLink TINAFTS  describing in no less than a full paragraph the wall directly behind their workspace will receive a free CD stuffed with sixty minutes of songs which I judge to be evocative of an 85-degree windless day in April.
