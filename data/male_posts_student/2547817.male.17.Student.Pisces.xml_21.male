With me now. I attempt emulating nonchalance. Daniel Koh. I can! I can't; I fail. Actors fooling themselves. Denial.  I am afraid of what the future holds. I want to doctor in nikeology. Just doing it. I can't finish this. I don't know how.  Daddy told me. He really did. They're never going to do anything good for you. That I should dispose of them. Loose them. Throw them away.  But they keep coming. They never leave. An unwilling alliance.
