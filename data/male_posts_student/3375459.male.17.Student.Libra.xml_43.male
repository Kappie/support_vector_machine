I tune into every radio station, and they all have one thing in common. The DJs keep on repeating its a Friday, so chill. ARRGHH I HATE FRIDAYS DURING HOLIDAYS, its feels like counting down till school reopens. Anyway, I got to fell in love with this song on air, its call Accidentally In love by Counting Crows. You'll find this song familiar, because it was taken off the sound track from Shrek II. A truly electrifying song, but sorry guys for I still have no idea how to share it with you on this blog. If you do have the time and patients, do look for it on the net or something (hopefully it’s not illegal), it’s a great song.   I think I've lost the momentum to continue with the cards, instead I'm doing another sketch with marker and colour pencils. Well, it didn't turn out too good. But it was a nice try, might even put this skill of colour sketch to good use in my course. Shortly after that sketch was done, I fell asleep and waking up to welcome dinner into my tummy. After dinner, I came back online to download and watch a few animes. Stoning was all I could do after that.  S T O N I N G . . .
