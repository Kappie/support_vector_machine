I have never seen it but it is supposed to be really nice. I think it may be cold where it is because its up in the hills literly and well I think it may be colder up around there. Also I was supposed to have a Strawberry Festival Committee meeting today but that did not happen we will just have one tomorrow on the feild. Well we got the kiddie rides and Broken Arrow bcak so this should be great all around I look forward to this weekend and all the fun it shall bring. Also my ferrets are doing well had them out for a long walk last night Dustin and myself brought them out around both cats like to keep their distance from them which is understandable because they are just like the squirls they usually hunt but this time they are pets.  We also got a great fright with our cat Princess last night we thought she got hit by a car because my brother was walking up the road kinda late at night and it looked like there was much blood all over her but really it was mud but we did not find that out until she came in the house it did kinda look like blood. Well thats about all I have to say for now, so until the next entry.
