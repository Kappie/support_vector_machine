The reason why I remembered is probably because during the dream, I had explained my situation to 2 people, by creating a "memory" in my dream to explain from, it kinda reinforced my memory of the dream. Anyway, without further ado, my dream:   I don't remember much from the beginning of it... some stuff and conversations to various people inside the school. The part where I start to remember is when I was talking to Tom Volpe (some guy in my TA) in some classroom. They were cutting off student's hands so they could put bracelets around them, then reattaching the hands. (Don't ask me how this makes sense ^^;;)    I was hesitant to go and have that done to my hand, but Tom was like saying they make it so it doesn't hurt and stuff. I watch as they put some kinda cream around Mina's (some short 9er in my TA) wrist, then cut it off. Then they attached the bracelet, and put the hand back on and putting some cream around the wrist again. After seeing this, I was like "ok... it might not be so bad afterall.   At that point though, I thought of an excuse. I was like "my parents' are going to freak if they found out my hand was cut off", because the operation kinda leaves a scar around the wrist. Tom was like *shrugz* and went to get his hand cut off (I didn't actually see that happen, since I was leaving by then).   Afterwards, I was outside with a bunch of people. It was night time. I was talking to a friend... I think it was Donald. We were watching the sky, and I was like... "hey, it's a spaceship!" The spaceship kinda looked like this: "|__)", of course, like bigger, and with lotsa details.    After that, subway trains started arriving one after the other. There were monsters and stuff in each one, and they weren't particularly full. The crowd started choosing their subway trains to enter, and I had this gut feeling that those trains would carry them to adventures. Donald was entering one of them, and I was like "hey, don't go, wait for an empty one", but he left anyway. So, I kept waiting for an empty one, but there wasn't, and all the trains have left, and I was just standing there alone.     I thought all of them were going to die or something, but not much later, the trains started coming back, and they returned. Then some alien person came out and told us to board the train that we were previously on. You could tell which train was which by the monsters in them. (Ummm...i think i recall a skeleton and a jack-o-lantern thingy, but not much besides that). So, the trains started coming back again. However, there was a small crowd left, and I was obviously part of that crowd since I had never boarded one in the first place.    The alien person was like saying "congratulations, you all made first place". And I was like "oO;; o...k...". We boarded the spaceship, and then I saw Aiza amongst the crowd, so I was like "hey!". I went to her and started telling her how I got there, and she told me how she got there too (i forgot her story... for some reason, I think there was a horse somewhere in there). Anyhow, I started kissing her for some odd reason oO;; well, not on the lips, but yah...    After that, I was talking to the alien person, and he was like "congratulations!", and I was like "oh... but i didn't really do anything..." and explained again how I got there. He kinda turned from friendly to angry, since I got there so easily... but then, he kinda was grudgingly nice after that.    The scene then cut to Social Science resource area, where these group of 4 or so were like at a table, and I just knew that their job was to think of stuff. Then this girl stood up and was saying something to the extent of "I can't take this anymore!". In my mind, I was like thinking "oh... the only way you're going to get out of this job is if you commit suicide." And for some reason, I think all the "winners" was going to receive this job...    An odd dream... pretty interesting. Tell me what you think of it.    ~Chronos
