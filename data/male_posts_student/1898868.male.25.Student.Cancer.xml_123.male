I turn to Blogger to escape from the daily stresses of our lives, our jobs, and the social issues that take their toll on all of us.  Although well thought-out and presented, reading that 6 page BLOG was like a stick in my eye.  Also, I cannot escape this pole-vaulting Jillian.  She had a whole article in the Sun-Times and the Daily Herald.  She has been on the local news.  I recently picked up a SELF magazine, (for those misogynists of you who never pick up a woman's magazine, SELF is a pretty popular and well-circulated one), and she has an article in there where she is showing off different exercises to do.  Is she now the Queen of all Media???  I have also given up on spelling and grammar in BLOGGER.
