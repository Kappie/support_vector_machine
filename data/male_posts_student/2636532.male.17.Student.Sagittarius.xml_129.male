When I went to the Blogger main page i see something about posting pictures to my blog hassle free without any html or any of that. So i jumped on it and downloaded this program called Hello and signed up and all that mojumbo. so as you can see below i posted my very first pic, and it was so easy. Yes that's me down there, and while it's not the greatest picture, it made me laugh and that's what counts. I guess I haven't really been posting very regularily as I too have felt the writers block. I mean, i knew what i wanted to write but i wasn't inspired to do so. Well i too am graduating this year, in a little over a month. It's weird that i'm going to have to get on with the rest of my life though, i mean i've become used to showing up at school every day infact it's all i really know. but back to grad, I'm MC for it, that's right little ol' is master of ceremonies for my grad, oddly i don't really know what that job entails. I guess i'll figure it out or something, right? Anyways enough of this, I'm gonna start putting pics up here more now because i can, and maybe get some of Errol and his sexy self up here too. -Matt
