Work was reasonably enjoyable because of the weather and the lack of as many crap jobs as usual. Notably, I got my second tip from an American woman who was oddly only wearing one sock and I also won our day's takings sweepstakes (I guessed £19,000 and it was £19,200), with a Mars bar the prize (ooh, the excitement!). I spent this evening playing  Battlefield 1942 , listening to music and browsing some forums. Tomorrow I'm off to work again, although only from 10.30am to 5pm.
