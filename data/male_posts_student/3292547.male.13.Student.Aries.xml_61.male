However, I must have been thinking about Church at the time because that was not correct. Everywhere else it says  A Crown of Swords , except for that post. The problem is now fixed, and let's hope it doesn't happen again.   I'm on page 645 for those of you wanting to know, and I hope to finish it by about Thursday or Friday. Now back to reading =-D
