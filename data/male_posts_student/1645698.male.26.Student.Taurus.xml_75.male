FALLING   stand, look in my hand talk with this line That's not the answer cry and now I know look in the sky I search an answer  So free, free to be I'm not another liar I just want to be myself... myself  And now the beat inside of me is a sort of a cold breeze and I've never any feeling inside around me... I bring my body carry it into another world I know I live... but like a stone I'm falling down  Damned, looking into the sky I can feel this rain right now it's falling on me fly, I just want to fly life is all mine some day I cry alone, but I know I'm not the only one I see that another day is gone,gone I don't wanna die... Please be here when I'll arrive, don't die... please
