I love a dirty road trip (or a big old bag of dirty road trip), where you get on the road, talk for a few hours, and next thing you know every third sentence is an inside joke, the car is constantly laughing, and every statement is knocked up a notch by the next statement, causing mass joy and exaltation.  I slept maybe 20 minutes in the combined 31 hours I was in the car because every time I might start to get sleepy, someone would say something crazy or start a new joke or throw out an old one, and we'd be laughing at business or Philbrook's dampness or the Chinese shit candy or a bad case of the lies.    Last summer I really didn't get a summer.  I wasn't working a hard job, but I was working 40 hours a week, living in a fairly boring place, and trying to stay ahead on finances until I got to school.  This summer bears the burden of making up for last summer's apathy.  And with that, there is a lot I need to do for myself and to learn about myself.  2002 was about money, cash in hand, paying off bills (that didn't get fully paid off) and living on budget.  This summer is about me, trying to remember the person I think I was and reconcile it with the person I've become.    California, Arkansas, North Carolina, Florida, Louisiana, Texas.    It should be better than submitting Interlibrary Loan requests.
