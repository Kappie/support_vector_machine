I woke up this morning at 1030, as Rebecky was supposed to call then, but she didn't call till 11, while I was on SC. So we planned, and eventually got Jason too, and we all agreed to go to Masonville.    So after mom was done talkin' to that insurance person at my house, and eating pizza, I got a lift to Masonville.    We bought stuff, I got a new pair of shorts, and then well eventually Rebecky left refusing to see "I,Robot" so in the end only me and Jason went to see that.    She missed out on a good movie. I won't ruin the movie though.    Then I got a lift home....    Watched some TV....    and here I am now done blogging.    Bye.
