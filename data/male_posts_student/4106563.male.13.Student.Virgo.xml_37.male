Then you'll like this. On Vh1, in the morning through afternoon, they have nothing to show, so they show un-premired shows. Sometimes they show re-runs, which sucks, they may only show one un-premired show a day throughout the week. But thats just bad luck. On Comedy Central, on Saturdays or sometime on the weekend, at midnight, they will show an un-premired episode of The Graham Norton Effect.  I'll get back to you with more TV tricks.
