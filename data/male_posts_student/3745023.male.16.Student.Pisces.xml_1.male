Well Kris, I had heard of this satellite, but I did not know about the seas on titan. It seems abit far for methane seas to be of any use over there, but one day…. Who knows? Maybe they will put moon corp. out business :- .  Hmmm…. Perhaps I should place a post explaining moon corp?  A psychologist by the name of Leo Sprinkle (funny last name, no idea where it’s from) has made several interesting discoveries on phobias. This is not important, but I think it is interesting. One man, who was afraid of dogs, was hypnotized (hoody hoo!) for the purpose of pinpointing the cause of the phobia. Nothing was found when asked about early memories. However, when asked about his first memory concerning his fear of dogs, the man remembered a scene with a man from the middle ages who was eaten by a wolf. The man assumed it was a past life and thanked Sprinkle. (hehe…) Another woman had a fear of drowning, and had similar results; she recalled a scene where an annoying pirate was thrown over board by his mates. She reached a similar conclusion as well. Both patients had a sense of identity with the character being killed. Sprinkle is in agreement with his patients, and believes that some phobias are caused by past deaths.   I bring up the thought of dreams. A dream is stored in the subconscious forever. They be misinterpreted by even deeper levels of the subconscious, or the conscious, and reapplied to the sub….. That’s my two sense on that. I’m looking for his e-mail so I can make the suggestion and have him question my credentials but have failed so far.
