Hmmmm I woke up at 12 and went with Derek to Burgers on Broadway, then went to Millard Electronics to drop off the tv (man the guy that works there, is so much ME if I grew long hair and loved Star Trek)  Then we went to work, really late.  At 1:30.  Hahha, then we unloaded a truck of drugs, put them in the units, busted the boxes down, and shoveled some snow.  Fun.  Then we went to get Hyvee and Derek got more tea.  I was like "Get some green tea with han-zi (chinese characters) on it.  Then we look a bit and found 'Giesha type', 'Confucius type', 'Indian guy riding elephant type', and ' Mongol Warrior type'.  So Derek got Djaleen(?) Indian and Mongol type tea.  Then at the checkout I saw a kid in a Strong Bad shirt.   I told him to "rock on, Strong Bad".  Now is the time to play Hordes of the Underdark.... remember:   You can't spell 'manslaughter' without 'laughter.'
