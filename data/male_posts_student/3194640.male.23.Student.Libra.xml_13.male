I couldn't help but feel angry/humiliated that a B in my public speaking class was even a possibility. I've taken more difficult classes, you know. Because I earned such good grades, I'm going to celebrate by buying Guster's new live album,  urlLink Guster On Ice: Live in Portland, Maine !  It should be awesome. Also, I found out last week that  urlLink Guster  is going to be in Kansas City July 17th with  urlLink Ben Folds    urlLink Gavin DeGraw . This will be my 3rd attempt to go see Guster. They've played in Lawrence and Kansas City about two or three times since they released their album  urlLink Keep It Together  last year. I've tried to go every time, but I haven't been so lucky.   If I am successful and I can actually go, it will be my first time ever seeing Guster live and my third time seeing Ben Folds. Ben is awesome live! I saw him in Oklahoma at the OSU Orange Peel in September 2003 and in Kansas City at the Beaumont Club in March 2002. I hoping to actually meet him this time around. That would be awesome.  Also, I haven't forgotten about my list. It's still not done yet. I had finals, work, etc. Can you blame me?   Peace out.
