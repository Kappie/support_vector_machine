It was a pretty good turnout, and thankfully my house wasn't wrecked (although the musical chairs episode minus the music damaged a few folding chairs). The freestyle sessions in the basement, led by Sam, Ferrell, Ray and my brother were classic. I'm gonna miss everyone from camp when its over next week, and I'll be looking forward to next summer with all you guys. Thanks to Dustin, Sam, Ferrell, Ashley, Nina, Shauna, Syrita, Angie, Ray, Adrian, Meghann, Nikki, Anne, Brian, Janet, Teionne, Heather, Colin, Woody, Pat, Half, Isoke, and all those whos names I forgot for a great time. Can't wait til Dustin's party on Friday.
