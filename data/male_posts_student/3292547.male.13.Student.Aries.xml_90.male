We got back a little late to pick up my sister from work. She had to stay 47 minutes late after she had gotten out.  Anyway, not much is going on. Only Robin is on right now, but she's cleaning her room like I should be.   Note: Robin lives in Kansas and is too old for me anyway ;-) don't suggest her a a g/f.
