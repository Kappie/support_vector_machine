I know the burden of pressing shift to capitalize is a great one, but c'mon Turing, you can do better than that. I used to type emails in caps like yours, but then I decided that I didn't want a job mixing concrete.   Here's the entire hate mail page(it skips you to the capslock section)... again, this is not my work, but maddox.   urlLink CapsLock
