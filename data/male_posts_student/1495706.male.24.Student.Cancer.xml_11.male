So, for example, Germany can't legitimately send troops to patrol Los Angeles, because Los Angeles is part of the United States, a sovereign country.  Which is to say, when you argue that you've transferred "sovereignty" to Iraq even though American troops can still do whatever the fuck they want to, you're wrong.  And it's not even like you were almost right about this.  Just full-on, no-holds-barred wrong.  Sad thing is, people might actually believe something meaningful has happened in Iraq and the war, officially over months ago, is no even more officially completed.    Sincerely, An Irritated Citizen.  PS- Just kidding!  If you want to redefine "sovereignty" to mean, well, whatever exactly it means in Iraq, that's cool.  You rock and I love you, so go right ahead.  Plus, you've already brought freedom and democracy to Iraq by constructing and establishing a government that was not elected, so I guess the actual definition of words (democracy; sovereignty) is a moot point.
