Apparently: my true love has discovered she loves me yesterday at midnight and something good will hapen to me between 2.00 and 4.00 today. Well, IT DID  Though its got nothing to do with relationships  shall I tell you anyway? OK,. then    SCHOOL ENDED!!!    and its friday today! That means my first weekend blogging.  Isnt it funny that today was hilariously boring and yet I have a lot to say?  Life is Wierd.  t . h . e . . . t . r . t . h . . . i s . . . o . u . t . . . t . h . e . r . e . . . . . .
