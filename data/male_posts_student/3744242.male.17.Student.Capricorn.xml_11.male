That mean I might have to go through all this fun and games all over again!  Hooray!  But I don't want to be greedy and hog all the fun, so if anybody else wants to take my place next time...feel free to do so.  The IV wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, me hating needles and all.  My one complaint though is that the nurse had really...really bad aim.  When she stuck the needle (gulp!)in the first time, I was ready for it and it wasn't that bad.  But then she proceeded to move it around in there, apparently looking for the vein.  Then she slid the needle almost all the way out and slid it back in again.  Then some more wiggling and some more sliding until she finally found the vein.  If this doesn't sound bad in writing, imagine how it was to watch it in your own arm...not so pleasant.  But I can't really complain because this was a small price to pay for them putting something nice into my arm that prevented me from having to deal with other, worse pain.  After the procedure, I have to tell you that I have only been that relaxed a few times before.  It really nice just lying there in the hospital on those nice beds with the medication still in your system.  I think I might have dozed off a few times here and there.  But then when I was finally mostly conscience, I got to ride in a wheelchair.  This was just my lucky day!  Nothing like being pushed around a big building like Children's and having everybody move out of your way.  Oh, and another thing.  I don't think I've ever missed food as much as I did today.  I hadn't had food to close to 44 hours and I was really starting to feel it after the procedure.  But on our way home, my mom stopped by a Dunkin' Donuts and I ate my first food in almost two days.  And let me tell you, that food didn't last two seconds, I went through it that fast.  It was like feeding time at the zoo, or at least I zoo where the animals aren't fed very much.  The rest of the day was mostly spent on the couch, in and out of conscienceness, trying to let the medication out of my system.  Its not the easiest thing to walk around after the sedate you.  So, I would have to conclude that today, except for the crazy IV, would have to rank among my top relaxing days.  Well, I have to let the rest of this medication get out before work tomorrow, so get out of here before I get my shotgun!  Out
