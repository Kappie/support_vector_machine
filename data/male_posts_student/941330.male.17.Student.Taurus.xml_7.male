I finished all the formatting I could -- or wanted -- to do with this lovely little we  blog   (though I couldn't use the Rams' colors of navy and gold because of the color of the brackets and Blogger link). I spent   too much time   doodling with minutiae like the color of the individual words and underscores in the footer. Sigh. Well I didn't exactly make that deadline of one night, but I got   close enough .
