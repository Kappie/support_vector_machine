We thought it was the Chinese guy but it was... AHMAD! Then on our walk home we found Malerie and Gavin. We went back to Pat's, then to Chris' and Quentan was the only one home so we bbq'd and watched funny stuff on the computer like Farting Preacher, FARTY MARTY II, FART HARDER. We also painted over Jimmy's name on Chris' steps. When Jimmy found out we all hid. I came down to see and Jimmy was just standing there breathing very hard with the most serious face, staring at the stairs. Then I said "Why did they do that?" Then Jimmy said "I dunno...maybe because I'm annoying." Then Jimmy left so I started painting over it...hehe. Then Ahmad and I forgot who else popped out of no where and was hiding. They held in their laughs watching Jimmy breath hard for 5 minutes. Then Mrs. Corby came home and everyone hid except for Gavin, Malerie, and me. Then when she came in the room again, we switched. Then I was hiding behind the door and when she came to it, I got all weird feeling and...EWWW YOUR WEIRD. Then we left Chris' and went back to my house. Eric, Ahmad and Jimmy had to go. Pat's sister and her cousin and Dan's brother Nicky came to see our Spooner Street Mafia practice. It was fun. We played many a song. At night, Chris slept over while I babysat Mike and Chris D, and Dan and Gavin snuck over. Alison thought Gavin's name was Captain. We beat up Mike and he started histerically crying and going psycho and he attempted to leave so we stole his key. Then we were nice to him so he forgot all about it and by the end of the night they didn't want to leave. Today, same thing, SSM was over. We jammed and Chris Corby came over with his sax and we started jammin with some Reel Big Fish - Take On Me...but it didn't work too good. After that we beet up Pat in a million layers of clothing, unfortunetly Eric had to leave early and missed it. You see, last year as a tradition, Eric and I have to wrap Pat in 100 layers of clothing and then beat the shit out of him. At night I went to a gay haunted house thing at Sports Plus with Keith, Matt and Hauppaugian girls name Jess, Kira, Nicole, and...uh...some other girl. The haunted house was lame, so I'm too lame to talk about it. Except for construction worker and the jail guy behind bars were both black...subliminal messaging through the haunted house. Then I started conversation with this dude with a hunch back and I said "I like you man," and he said "Woman." Yes...I'm starting to talk about it now so let's stop. I saw Angelica there, and my cousin's friend Lupo. That's an awesome name. I think I mentioned him a long time ago in this blogger. Some time in the summer I think it was. Why don't you go check. God damn, I miss the summer so badly. Fuckin school, I'm gonna keep "Fuck School" on my profile all throughout the school year. Oh yes, Mike, the kid I was babysitting said he knows a huge kid in his grade (6th grade) that's name is Jake Smith. That was an awesome shock. Ok, it's done now. Leave...I just got home from my cousin's house (Murphy's), the game was cancelled...it's done now. Done now. Now. Bye.
