And it puts me in a difficult and unfair position.  After all, intentionally or not, I brought you guys to the group more or less.  So any conflict that arises is gonna be my fault.  I like you guys and Journalcons, but I also owe the group my support, if not for Patty herself than for the church.  And you all don't seem to have noticed that as our little clique grows, we're losing people.  Has anybody seen Kraig lately?  Does anyone know where he is?   As Erin said, you joined the group so we could hang out together.  I think that's the wrong reason.  If you don't like Patty and you don't want to do Youth Group things (which, amazingly enough, involve religion) than consider whether you should be coming.  Because to join the Youth Group, scare away other people, and then bitch about Patty and how things are run seems stupid and counterproductive. So that's my stance. (BTW, It's worth noting that most of that stuff doesn't really apply to Thomas or Nathan.)   The ultimate starship is Alfre Woodard's forehead.
