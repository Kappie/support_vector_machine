(not really quoted, hehe) And he's right. I know, you think I'm stupid now, it's not the physical sense. I know that, I just wanted to mess with you. If you don't know what Karn is, good. You know, from now on I am going to refer to you as 'the wall'. You see, typing right now is like talking to a wall, I just confirmed that with someone. I also confirmed that most of what I typed about the China is wrong, so ha! I love Pie. You heard me, pie. Pie, Pie, everywhere pie....Big pie, little pie, green pie, red pie. Enough about pie. What are you like, wall? I suppose you are sitting in your nice little chair, reading this...pie....Mmm, I'm sorry, did I actually type that? Woosta! Art is stupid. I have an art class and I don't like it. We were using these cool quill pens and I doodled all clase. You see, I was forced into art by an over zellous(sp) guidance teacher. She thought I should take it in place of a study hall, and so I am in art. It is quite boring and my artistic skills rival that of a three year olds'. So, enough about art. Did you know that A=1/2bh? Of course you did, you're smart. At least, I'm going to consider you smart from now on. I don't feel like explaining things to you. Well, I am going to leave you now. I know, you want me to type more, you are craving the words that are flowing from my keys, but alas! I want to go sleep. Think about that, I cherish sleep more than I do sustaining your need for my thoughts put into words. If I were you looking at me I would be frozen over from the coldness coming off me. You know what they say, It's a fool who plays it cool by making his world a little colder.
