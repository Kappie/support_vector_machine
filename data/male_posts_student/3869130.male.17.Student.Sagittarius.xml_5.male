As far as random things of the day go  here .   Still no luck with the wireless networking as of yet...it's quite perplexing I actually think there is a good chance the unit isn't working.   Ok...now that we're all asleep.  urlLink  Check this out!   I kinda feel bad about skipping out on the parade yesterday...but that's over so I can resume not caring. ;)  I'm tired again and i really wonder how much longer I can keep this blog alive...please someone e-mail or post a message to give me something to talk about!  Well I'm glad I'm on your list of random people to trust....but what makes me so weird?  Questions to be answered next week  -Stephen
