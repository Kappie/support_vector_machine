The overwhelming idocy I seem to have to deal with on almost a daily basis startles me, especially since it doesn't all come from student-athletes.  The first idiot was here in the Writing Center, about two or three weeks ago, and was a student-athlete.  I think I might have mentioned him--a tour came through, and this moron kept telling said tour that we wrote papers for him.  As a result of his stupidity, we are limited in what we can and cannot do to a student's paper.  One of the big things I'd do is help with word choice.  Students, whether athletes or not, often use the wrong word.  Either they don't have the vocabulary for what they're trying to say, or they just misuse a word.  Whatever, it happens, even to me.  So I'd suggest other words.  Or I'd rework a sentence so it flowed better.  Well, no more.  Now all I can do is circle where the mistake is and tell there's a mistake.  I can't offer suggestions on how to fix it.  Stupid.  The next group of idiots were encountered this past Saturday during the OU/OSU game.  I went for my jog during the third quarter, and as I was walking back, I saw a group of OU students (well, college-age guys wearing OU shirts) heckling a ten year old wearing OSU stuff.   A ten year old .  Am I alone in thinking that if they have to pick on a ten year old to win an argument, they really have no business being in college?  Mind you, OSU fans were no better--as I continued walking, I came even with an older couple in orange.  As we all walked past a house near the stadium, someone started up a call and answer "OSU" "Sucks."  Well, this set the old guy off, and he starts complaining loudly about how asanine OU fans are.  Which they are, but OSU fans are not innocent themselves.  I mean, come on, people, it's a freakin'  game  you're getting worked up over here.  How or why is this so damn important?  I sometimes wonder if all these morons are placed in my path simply to test my patience.  Or maybe it's just indicative of football and its fans (the student-athlete who caused trouble a few weeks ago was a football player).  This state's morbid fascination with all things college football is ridiculous and probably some sort of social disease.  I keep wondering if it's airborne and whether or not I should wear a mask when I come to work.  In non-football-related stupidity, I think folks need to learn how to use their damn turn signals.  Lemme explain--the little switch thing on the left side of your steering column?  Yeah, that's the turn signal.  If you push it up, the right turn signal flashes.  Push it down, the left turn signal flashes.  These are designed to be used  before  you turn.  Not in the middle of the turn.  Not after you've started the turn.   Before .  In case you're curious, it's to warn other people on the road what it is you're doing so they don't run into you.  I swear, if I come across one more dipshit who doesn't know how to use these things, I'm going to go librarian poo.  Tune in next time, when I'll discuss merging onto the interstate and why that doesn't mean "driving 35 MPH" or "coming to a complete stop when no one's coming."  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, "In the Dark of the Sun"
