The guys came out there, (Mikey, Caine, and Will) and we all ate some hot dogs and sausages. Yuummmmyyy. Well the lightning and thunder kept getting worse and worse, and when Deidre called her mom, her mom said that the storm was coming from Throckmorton and it was only going to get worse. So we packed up our stuff and got the heck out of there. When went to Tori's house, and right as we all got sat down to watch a movie the storm kicked in. LoL Just in time!! We watched Duplex and Gothika. The guys left around 2... late late! And we all went straight to sleep. 'Cept for Caine's car trouble, everything else was okey day. Katy and Deidre stayed up a little longer to watch the Fast and The Furious.. one of their favorites due to the famous actor Paul Walker... blah! LoL Luv ya Katy!  Well, I left Tori's house early this morning cuz I had to go to work at 11. :( I only had to work for about an hour. And now I gotta go back tonight at 5. Fun fun! Mikey is at a family reunion so I miss him terribly. LoL Even though I saw him 11 hours ago! :S:S Hehe... well gotta go! Adios! ~ChRiStIn ElAiNe
