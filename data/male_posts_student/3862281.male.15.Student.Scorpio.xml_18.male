Hell, I spent 2 hours listening to music played at different speeds, it's not a good thing to know that Coldplay at twice the speed is the funniest thing since Tenacious D (best band ever). Anywayz, got bored listening to music at funny speeds and I decided to edit one of my pictures and I thought I'd share it, so here it is...     ...yeah, ok, it's stupid but I was really bored alright?! I was kinda going for a robot kinda thing but I ended up goofing it up.  And no smarmy comments like 'What's changed?'.
