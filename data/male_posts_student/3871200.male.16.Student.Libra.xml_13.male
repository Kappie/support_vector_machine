Then the performance starts, our class is the fifth to perform. There are a total of ten classes.      Alright, it was our turn to perform. We went to the center stage and began hitting and banging. After that we bow to the judges and went back to our seats. Then they announce the top three best performance, the first to announce was "The return of the chewing gum". Then the second to announce was "Debamboo". At that time our whole class just went silent because nobody in our class thought we would win , including Mr Chandra. Than the third to announce was "Storm". We got an envelope and inside it was $50. Haha, Mr Chandra said he's going to give us a treat next week.           After the whole performance thingy, it was time for lunch. What's more, lunch was provided - buffet style! Hahaha, food was very very nice and yummy. Drink was very very de sweet. After eating, a group of us went to search for the chess club again. Then we play weiqi for about an hour, in the end don't even know who won cause everyone in the club is going home and they had to lock the room, so we just have to stop playing. Then we went to the sports hall and continue playing a few games of chess. Then me, Xin Hao and Meme went to look for Mr Chandra to print out some pictures we took on tuesday in Chinatown. Mr Chandra said we had to come back an hour later so we went off first. On the way to the sports hall, Meme met one of her friends and talk for a long long time. Me and Xin Hao also wait for a long long time. Then we two went into a stationary shop and when we came out, we didn't see Meme. So we went to the sports hall and on the way there, I went to collect my concession card while Xin Hao went to look at the Wushu CCA. I went home after collecting my concession card.      Playing bball today, so long didn't play le. Got jd, kp, kh, jh, bo, wp, ws, zx and me playing. After everyone arrives, while we were opening numbers, got two guys ask us if they could join us so with the eleven of us, we had to play full court. The teams were decided, kp, kh, jd, ws, jh and me on one team while the others on the other. Maybe too long didn't play le, becoming lousier, two opens also cannot score... haiz... then leg also pain. Halfway playing it started to drizzle, luckily it's just a small drizzle. Then the lights went out, nobody take note of the score... -_-'' Ws and wp went back first while jd, kp, kh, jh, zx, bo and me went to buy water and talk talk and talk before going home.
