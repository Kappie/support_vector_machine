Crying out that life is unfair, Wondering "Why or why had I not been a pear?"  In doubt and worry they sighed, Until the final day when they became acidified.  The lesson learnt is one shouldn't worry about the following hour, For that will simply make you taste damn sour...  Lyrics: Janet the Lost  Note: Dedicated to Qian Jin and Nana!
