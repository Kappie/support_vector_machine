Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry said on Monday he would have voted for the congressional resolution authorizing force against Iraq even if he had known then no weapons of mass destruction would be found.   What happened to "I was mislead by Bush"??  He's now saying he would have voted for force anyway?    So he votes for the use of force, now saying the so called 'BUSH LIED' evidence wasn't a big part of it, and yet he still blasts the president for using the force that Kerry authorized?  What, was the authorization not really an authorization?  What did it mean John??    Geez....
