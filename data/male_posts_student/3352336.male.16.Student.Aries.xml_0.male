       
       Finally!  After one mother of an Economics exam, I am free from the horrible experience that is   GCSE  .  I actually think I did quite well in that exam, and am rather pleased with myself that I could answer all of the questions presented to me. For once.  Whether or not I got the right answer is another matter...
