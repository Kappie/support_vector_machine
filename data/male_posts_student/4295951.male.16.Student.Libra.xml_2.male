"I M DAVID" if you ask me, its more of a statement than a name which is quite fitting for him since when a 4th year student hears the word "DAVID" it automatically sends chills down his spine. haha because of him the word "*BBQ" would forever haunt me. haha       remiter. the economics teacher. without a doubt one of the smartest teachers in la salle. as you all know, economics involves a lot of memorization in the part of the students and the teachers but not once have we seen remiter look at a "kodigo" in writing his lecture in the blackboard. it all comes from his moderately sized head. hehe    a joke from remiter:   remi : anong tagalog ng "liquid assets?"  us : ano?  remi : nagbabasang pagaari . hahaha! if thats not funny i dont know what is. hehe       physics becomes so much easier with ms. yky (pronounced as ikay) shes one of the coole teachers in la salle along with our geometry teacher ms. marie. she gives the best projects in the world! haha creative lab rules!      ms. castillo or more popularly known as 'tiya fely. zzzzzzzzz. english teacher and adviser. zzzzzzzzzz. so far, i only have 2 pages of notes in my english notebook.
