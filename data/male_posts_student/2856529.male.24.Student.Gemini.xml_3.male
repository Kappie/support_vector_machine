That led me to reviews of Lynn Truss's book Eats, Shoots and Leaves. The cover of the book is interesting. It has a panda on a ladder trying to wipe out the comma between Eats and Shoots. You will be able to appreciate it if you know the joke. The joke isreproduced in this  urlLink article , besides having listing some hilarious instances of misplaced punctuation marks.It is kind of interesting that even in this age ofshorter and efficient communiques where most people spell 'through' as 'thru' and 'photo' as 'foto', myself included thereare still somepeople trying to keep English together as a language rather than a rag tag bunch of phonetically spelt words.
