Came home, did nothing, played Zelda... didn't played drums, had an huge IMAGINATION conversation with Pat about how Erics attacked us all and I took the rest into my own fantasy world of imagination. Mad Pat's night of sillyness. Nothing else happened... just confused on what's happening Friday. Boing. Good Night Fred.
