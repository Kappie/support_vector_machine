I would have had to do the paper-route and all but I guess she just thought I shouldn’t do it because of my ankle.  I agree with that.  It is bad enough that I’m going to football camp and walking around all the time.  It still hurts all the time and is a pain in the, I want to say ass but that doesn’t hurt so I’ll say my foot.  So yeah, I lifted this morning.  I did bench press and power clean.  I’m getting pretty darn good with power clean.  I think I lift the most in my class.  I’ve gotten up to 190x3.  I always feel weird doing all that weight.  What’s worst of all is that I’ve been told my form isn’t all that great.  So if I got that down, I’d probably be able to do more.  I’m thinking that I’m not going to be making much gain on that.  Oh well, I don’t care much about how much I do.  Though is would always be impressive to be able to do more.  I don’t know... I’m just babblin’ now.  So after lifting, I went home and sat around for a while.  Then I went out to lunch and came home and slept for a while.  I love and hate taking naps.  Sure, when you’re tired, a nap sounds great.  But when you wake up, you always feel groggy and somewhat still strangely sleepy.  And that’s how I feel now.  That means I should go to bed.  Good night.
