Oppertunities have suddenly presented themselves to me, and they are good enough to disrupt my plans. Hmmmmm. Do you plan?  Do you scheme?  Do you try to run mental circles around your foes? Whats that?  You say that you don't have foes?   Then you are in more trouble than I thought. You have foes, surely not like Lex Luthor, but you have foes all the same.  If you still think not, look a little closer at your friends, then examine your aquaintences, your foes are there lurking. This is not paranoia. It's just something of which you need to be made aware. Still doubting? Okay... Think for a moment is there someone at work or school who just annoys you to no end?  And silently you've found yourself rooting for their eventual fall, whether it be a work or else where.  Well not everyone is silent, some people are acutally ou to get you, whether it be because of what you represent or what you have said in the past. People are petty. Not as a rule, but it's still something to watch out for. Life is not fair, and you should look out for times when others may try and trip you up. Just a word of advice.  I had to learn the hard way. I'll leave that story for another time though.
