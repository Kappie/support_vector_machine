The journey seems to left me with much of painful  unforgettable memories rather than happiness. Planning the future but dare not think of being with eternally. Eternity is an impossibility. Like the daily routine of the sun, our love had set down. Perhaps there is no more love in us. Why am i still living in torments? I'm sure that i don't love u anymore but why am i so discourage when i hear about u? What a person had been through, had been through. There is nothing such as restart or starting over just because the scar is not visible n the pain is no longer there. But the scar is always there. Same as our minds; once stretched, it will never regain to its original dimension. Probably this is why I can't forget u. I am sure I can get over in no time. Should i be proud or guilty? Proud as in able to forgive n move on while guilty as in my love isn't that deep enough. When the feelings isn't there anymore, can i force it back? Til now, there is no proven ways. So should the next sunrise brings u back to me? I doubt as well as i believe the reason for the parting is inevitable. So i will continue my life while waiting for someone i don't love to come back to me .
