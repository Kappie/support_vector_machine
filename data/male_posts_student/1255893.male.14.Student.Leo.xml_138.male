You guys remember how I could do the "crash face" so perfectly before puberty? I loved that guy (sorry for the past tense). I rememberthe 3rd time I  went to a WWE event.  I had a poster of me and him with a sign saying "separated at birth". He saw it and came out of his car just to sign it. At the time I was just speechless. Now I wish I would've told him something... anything! I feel horrible right now. And being 3:45 in the fucking morning ain't helpin :(
