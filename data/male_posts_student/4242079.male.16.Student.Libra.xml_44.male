Due to lack of any real motivation to retype it all...i'll stick to the basics. Crystals parents are mad at me. I apparently "peeled out" of their driveway. Yes, I see the danger a 1989 Nissan Sentra piece of shit car could pose. Watch out, the tire might fly off and break your window. I don't think I really did anything wrong. Ooooh, my tires may have spun a little bit. It's fucking winter, shit happens. It's the way I drive. I don't think I really caused any harm or danger or any other negative effect. Assuming I even did it. And her mom also thinks I'm evil because Crysal and I occasionally sleep in the same bed. It's not like I've caused her to become the High Priestess of the church of Satan. Honestly.   I'm sick of this. All through bloody highschool, my life was an act. I didn't drink, I didn't smoke, I didn't do drugs. And for what? So parents might like me. And look, they still hate who I am, so I guess I wasted my entire youth away trying to be something I didn't want to be. I really need a change. I don't care what Crystal thinks anymore. I'm getting the tattoo I want, and I'm going to wear the clothes I want. I'm sick of all of this. This is me people, if you don't like it, get rid of me...
