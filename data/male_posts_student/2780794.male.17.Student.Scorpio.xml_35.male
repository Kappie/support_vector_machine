Had a discussion with Jie Hong and Kin Leong juz now after training with Line 1. It went pretty fine considering the fact that again I have really bad presentation skills and people alwaez misintepret me. Proof can easily be taken from my results and my frenz. I neva wanted to bring up the club myself. Neva. If you still dun believe, you can clarify with the whole of Line 1 and Jie Hong and Kin Leong. All i want is us together to bring the club to greater heights. Not me alone. I did state i juz wanna help. haiz. I'm sorie that i'm quite sharp-tongued or wadeva u call it but i'm straightforward and i do wad is right. Hopefully from now onwards,we can train together as a team as one playing together with the unity that could bring us victory. and Handy,i'm prepared to shake ur hand and sae sorie for wad i haf done. Hope u'll accept it. Thankz. And another round of apology to the rez of the management. I'm sincere and from the bottom of my heart i'm sorie.  Sincerely yours, Mohd Akil
