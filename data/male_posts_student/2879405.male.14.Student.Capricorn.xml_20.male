Although i didn't revise for my geo at all, i still managed and found it easier than i thought. I don't think i will get a high mark, neither do i think that i will fail. Softball match against North Vista was boring as can ever be. I was made to pitch(at least more experience gained) for only 1 inning before god said "ok softballers its time to stop your game". I striked 2 out before having the 3rd to come out and it rained. What a day! the score shan't be postphoned like what the game did and start with a fresh sheet. As you know, it seems like a glory pitching strikes and hard to come by (if i'm not on form). In other words, all my efforts were wasted for nothing excpet on those vistarains(who tasted the power of msh pitcher). Following that i am going to have the game of the season which is held at kallang against MSS(Montfort Secondary School). They are known to be local rivals who are competing with us for the prestigious championship title.
