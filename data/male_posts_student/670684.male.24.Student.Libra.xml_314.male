There's a fair amount to say, but why or how?  I am writing a fascinating screenplay, I believe.  Pitched it today in class and got good response, with criticism aimed at making my content better, not at changing my structure.  I'm pulling my social life to a level it hasn't seen since Centenary, finally...for the first time I have the money to go out on a fairly regular basis, and I'm well past the post-undergrad funk that wrecked my confidence for two years.  I still struggle in forced conversation points...I hate silence, and my problems arise when I start to plug what I consider awkward silence with whatever machinations ring out in my head.  I'm falling back out of the shape I got myself into this summer, which wasn't incredible, but posed for increased energy...a life of reading books and articles and writing dialogue and action doesn't beget time at the Slaughter pool or the Gregory Gym.  And the Ultimate players around here are too focused on gaming for me to pick-up with them...if I could find a group that gets together once a week to throw disc and play a game, that'd be great.  As would finding a high-quality orchestra that only practices twice a week.    This blog isn't therapy, and I don't mean for it to become that.  I'll get back to the stories, the political rants, the film reviews, the shits...
