Friday was Michelle's (cousin) graduation. It was super fly illitude. I'm at dan and joes now, sleeping here for the first time in I think, ONE FUCKING BILLION YEARS! It will be very fun. I jammed with cricket today, and it was totally kickass. I was loving having another guitarist that can play to play with. I wanted to see Kaya before she left, and the circumstances didn't let me. I was putting all my plans on hold to see her before she left, but then my cousins cancelled, I called Kaya, and we decided she'd call me when she finished what it was she was doing. I went to dan and joes, and my dad called me and was very angry. Because apparently my cousins had showed up.  Right before my dad called, i had been at at D's for about 5 minutes, when kaya called and said that she was done. I was like ARGH! because I was really tired. And I was about to call her back and tell her I wanted to come over...but that was when my dad called. So! last night was the last night everyone was here, and the last graduation party. We went to frito misto for dinner. After dinner, we hung out in my room and played DDR, when Michelle asked if we wanted to get stoned with her friends, so we were okay with that. We went to to her friends house, which was like, 45 minutes away, and just smoked out of his bongazoid, I went home and went to sleep. I'm over the drugs thing...but its alright to do every once in a while. Last night was like, my third time this year.  But, as it is 12:25 am.... I'm not at my computer. so I'll see ya'all later. ~Elan p.s I love you Kaya Comments?
