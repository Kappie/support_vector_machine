It nails everything a good movie should have.  1) Action The movie has action happening just about every 10 minutes...and it's not just some fist fight. I'm talking about fighting that ragnes from the top of buildings to a runaway subway car (which was my favorite part). Since just about 99% of the people saw it opening day, I thought that tobey maguire's most shining moment is at the end of that scene. This is when he's straining all his muscle's and shooting web in order to stop, He's screaming at the top of his lungs and his suit is ripping....good stuff (not the suit ripping, the rest)  2) Special Effects A lot of people said the effects in the first movie looked cheesy...I thought they were awesome, but w/e. When sony said they were gonna make the effects in this movie 10 times better than the best scene in the first movie. I was like, "ok, thats just them trying to get people to go see it." Well, it was that, but only because it was true. Every effect is flawless, and looks completely real. Doc. Ock's tentacles have personality, and give him more depth. Perfect  3) Acting Tobey, Alfred, Kirsten, and James all nail the parts. I always liked all of Tobeys movies but he is perfect in this. He was born to play spider man ........ok enough, if you haven't seen it, see it. If you haven't played the video game, buy it. If you haven't heard of it, get a life.
