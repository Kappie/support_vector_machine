This church was started by Troy Perry in 1960.  Since that time, it has been one of the fastest growing denominations.  It is a predominately GLBT (gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgendered) church, though we are open and accepting of anyone.  It is my dream that we will one day lose the "gay church" label and simply become the church that will love anybody.  That is the way I personally view our churches (though of course each individual congregation has its problems).    I also added my home church's website--the  urlLink Exodus MCC , here in Abilene, TX.  Though it probably goes without saying, we are not associated with Exodus International in any way.  In fact, Exodus MCC predates Exodus International.  Our church has been growing at an amazing rate over the last 12 months or so...our membership has doubled during that time.  Further, because of all this growth, we are about to complete a building addition that will almost double the room in our sanctuary!  This is a very exciting time at Exodus!  If you are ever close by, join us...our services are at 11:00am and 7:00pm on Sundays and 7:30pm on Wednesdays.  ALL are welcome!  Finally, I have added another blogger with whom I have several things in common.   urlLink Heretic's Corner  is a blog run by a lesbian seminarian.  Her thoughts are very insightful, and she is an accomplished writer.  (Note: I only hope you don't find her so interesting that you stop reading me!  Remember we should all read our gay seminarian's site, too!)  If you have never visited her site, go give it a read...you won't be disappointed.  Coming soon on this site...I have decided that I think it would be good to trace briefly my journey from small-town conservative Church of Christ good boy to the gay evangelical good boy who wants to live in a big town!  I know that many of you who read this site are pondering gay/Christian questions.  I hope by telling the significant points in my journey, you can come to draw your own conclusions about faith and sexuality.  I have obviously drawn my conclusions already.  (For those who don't know I had a ceremony of Holy Union to my partner, Jason, on January 3rd this year.)  Well, that's it for now...till next time...good day and good theology!
