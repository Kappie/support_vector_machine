I got out of the house carrying 25 pesos and ended up here with 48... cool huh?  Anyway this week is so darn boring... I know it isn't over yet but I expect the rest of the week to be as dull as a noontime drama series shown on local tv networks... and HBO ain't even putting anything good on teh screen.
