We went to Pizza Hut and i ate a whopping 7 pieces of pizza!!! i was so full after that(no sarcasm intended). As we were coming back to school from that we saw a cop car with his lights on and he zoomed by which was kind of amusing! So anyway when we got back I went to science class and we watched a movie "Cyclone" it was amusing because it had tornadoes and hurricanes!! So when science class was over me and Spencer were talking about how cool it would be if we had an edo in gym class ans as luck would have it we did have an edo which was really weird. Now we were walking to our lockers and we were talking about how cool Skavenjah will be tonight and we had fun talking about that than out of complete nowhere Spencer found one of the mini Skavenjah advertising posters i had made on the ground by our lockers!!! It was scary because that was the second "sign" we had within like 2 minutes of the other. My theory is that the girl i have a crush on will actually have a secret crush on me due to all those "signs" taking place and we actually find out and than we start going out!!! Wow that would be awesome.... i hope it happens. But back to Skavenjah. So tonight me and Spencer are going to Skavenjah (a local ska band) and i hope we hae tons of fun because ska is so fun and happy and yah. oooo i almost forgot about when me and Spencer went to Co-Op in 5th. So we went to Co-op and i was wanting to go look at the toys and before we got there we got our 3rd "sign". The sign was water guns for 8 bucks!!!!! so we each bought ourselves a water gun and filled them up and were squirting things outside and Mr. Allen told us we couldnt spray anymore so we waited for the bell and i got owned by Spencer. i am completely soaked and still am as im typing this blog! Well anywho im finished yackin about what happened today, cant wait to blog my experience i will have tonight! later.  *-*Matty*-*
