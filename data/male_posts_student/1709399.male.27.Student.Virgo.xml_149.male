While the Victory in M.P was expected , the margin was huge than predicted by any opinion polls. The Rajasthan win was a big surprise because Gehlot's Govt wasn't that unpopular ( To give them Credit , both Gehlot  Digvijay had done a Decent job during their stint ) . Delhi gave a Thumping Majority to Sheila Dikshit for all the Good work she has done in the last few years. Chattisgarh was embroiled in controversies from day one and turned out to be a surprise for BJP.                                  One good thing about this election was it was fought on a Development Platform ( Bijli , Sadak , Paani) rather than the Hindutva plank which shows a remarkable maturity .
