Well if it does... what the heck does this mean??! I CAN POST SMILIES AGAIN!!!  Unfortunately, our forums were reset (actually, the whole site broke down because of the server's maintenance, the files were accidentally corrupted). All disappeared and i'm back to square one. My smilies were gone and i have to re-upload it...  Well, it's nice to be back OnLine. Darn, we have a new number... again?!!!
