I was just playing for the fun of it. My goodness, anyways let's see what I've been upto lately. Last night I watched Gladiator! Man, that's a good movie... but they cut out my favorite part on the tv! Ya know the part when he takes the two swords and cuts off the guy's head? hee hee *evil grin* sorry to all you female readers, guy moment. I've been doing lot's of school and stuff lately nothing really out of the ordinary. Except last Friday at the Mosses oh man that was fun. We were playing bandu and I made this little evil knievel and motorcycle then we made a ramp with sharp rocks and ya know fun stuff. Oh boy well I've finally posted so you can stop having a cow, you know who you are. Ha ha well I'll update more later. Till then!  Hoight!
