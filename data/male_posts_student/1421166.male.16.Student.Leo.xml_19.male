I come to realise how all this while, I sought after what I thought was love, not realising, that true love had all the while been around me. It is Mothers' Day. And I felt family love, and love from God. It was a great time at night when we went for dinner at Bukit Timah Guild House. And then, we had a surprise for our Mom when she came home at night. What warmth of a family. Yesterday, we had Bible Study and Recreation during YF again. It was fun I guess. Bible study is kind of different this year too. And we sang "How could I live without you" during worship, and I come to realise, that it is God that I can't do without. Then we had Recreation. They kind of incoporated traning for the expedition into Captain's Ball. Not only was the game longer. For every ball scored, the team that is scored against would have to do 12 push ups. Whoa...it was so tiring. And today, it's aching all over. Then it was fun la...I managed to score. It's late, haven't done my homework. But somehow, I'll get through all these.
