WAT?! i also argued with her but she do not wan to talk about it cos it involved s*x? urgh......from wat i know, the egg that we bought are......jus egg minus the 'tadpole'.....from wat i know, that the cock (the male chicken!) are separated from the female. so there is not chance that they can.......and somemore, like human they do produce egg just tat not in an 'egg' form and they produce it daily not 28 day.......i learn it from bio. conclusion, the chicken egg which we bought from the supermarket are not fertile, so it cannot be consider as a living thing. but i think fertile egg is much more exp than non-fertile one. ok....nonsense again.......medic!!!!!!!! I NEED SOME MED!!! :O
