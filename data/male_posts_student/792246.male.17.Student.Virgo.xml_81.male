For those of you who I haven't told yet, something really depressing is happening on April 23rd.  Let me give you background. My father was very annoyed with his employer, disagreeing with some of their corporate decisions strongly. Over Christmas break, an old work friend of my father's from Agfa jokingly mentioned he was always welcome to go back and take his old job. At the time he didn't even consider it. Flash forward to now. His company(EFI) has just liquified the project he spent 7 months working on, as well as docking his salary, and lowering health-care benefits, again. He quit on the spot, without even telling us before he did it. He also negotiated his way out of the two-weeks notice.  He then went to search for a new job. Unfortunately, in a sad truth I wish he would have considered first, it is impossible to find work in the Bay Area right now.  So his plan was to move back to Boston for a few months, working at Agfa until he could find a real job back here. This plan was decided about a week ago. Last night however, my uncle(on my father's side) passed away from a heart attack.  Aside from the emotional baggage we all have from this, it poses other problems as well. My uncle was the sole source of income for his family, and they have very little money right now. He was also the sole caretaker of my grandparents, neither my father or aunt wanting that responsibility. My grandparents need regular adult care and supervision, and are currently being evaluated as to whether to be moved into a nursing home.  So my father's plan to stay for a few months, probably just during the summer, has turned into an indefinate length of time. My mother, already upset at this previous plan, insists on going with him now, and according to her, if we're all moving to Boston for a long time, it doesn't make sense to move back to Palo Alto. My father's other sibling, my aunt, lives in Chicago, which is too far away to be of any help whatsoever. So we are moving to Boston on April 23rd. I'm sorry.  Now the corny part. I love you all. I really do. I don't think many of you really know how truly shitty my life was until I met all of you, and if you do, I doubt you know how much I appreciate it. I am still going to be here until the 23rd, and I believe that means I can still go to Prom. I am also going to try and spend the month of August here for the most part, so I get to say goodbye to all of you.  Lastly, I wrote a  urlLink poem  expressing my feelings about all of this. I know it sucks, and I can't write, but it's the only way I knew how to express what I'm going through. I truly feel like a part of me has died. I love you all.
