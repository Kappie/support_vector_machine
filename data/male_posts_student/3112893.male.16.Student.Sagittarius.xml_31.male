It's a website that will extremely detailed tabs, audio clips, video clips, some technique, and some exercises to help the learning guitarists. It started as being just a reference for my cousin and me after we became so fed up with people who write and post extremely poor quality, and even inaccurate tabs. Then we thought of making it a service and maybe even a learning reference for everyone, but we'll see. Neither of us are expert guitar players, but until we become considerably better, I definitely want to put together the tabs of extremely high detail and get 'em up on a site for all to see.  It probably wont realize itself until like August though and even then it'll probably only have modest mouse, the get up kids, and they might be giants tabs :-(. The thing is that for anything to get our seal of approval, it has to be so detailed that no one has the patience to do it. If you think you have the patience to tab out all the guitars of an entire song accurately (close enough doesn't count) then please leave a comment, or better yet e-mail me at thelordmeowmix@gmail.com Help is always welcome :-).  That is all.         -- Feanor
