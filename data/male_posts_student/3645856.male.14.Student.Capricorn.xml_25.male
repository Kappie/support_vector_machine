Anywho, today my parents visited Doug... my dad went to high school with him. Erm.... yeah. Doug is redneckish... well, not in the way he acts. It's sorta like me.... he's an anti-bush democrat with the most southern accent you would ever hear.  My mom and I went with Doug's wife Stephanie and her daughter Amber to the water park in Atlanta.... wait.. crap... is it in Atlanta or Marietta... anyway, it was Six Flags Whitewater Park... it was fairly ok... I mostly sat in the sun with a couple towels :P and went on a few rides. I fell asleep... let's see... oh... Stephanie knows this lifeguard dude there who is a gay stripper... we met him. Then we met her boss at the park... Anyway... Stephanie and Amber went to eat at her parents and Doug is here with my parents and i'm on their computer. I don't know wether i'm spending the night here or if we're going all the way back to Savannah tonight... brrr... cold cold cold. I kept thinking about the dream I had where Shelly was shot by that Carrot Top... ya... just dial down the center... 1-800-CALL-ATT. I hope Shelly is okay... damn, that dream was rather strange :P... picture Carrot Top with a gun trying to shoot someone... he was wearing a hoodie and these patchy hippy looking patchy jeans with red socks and black tennis shoes... he was sort of... frowning... and jogging... carrying a .38 special revolver... then he shot shelly... and ran... that evil little wanker. I'll get you Carrot Top!!!
