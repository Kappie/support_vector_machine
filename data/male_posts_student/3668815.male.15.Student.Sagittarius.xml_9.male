To NOT get angry , it takes 1.   Today may not be the day i was looking forward to , when i reached school , ppl tell me my ex-stead talking to a group of guys. And was jus too sick of it manz... As , we broke up jus last night.  Hey , its not that i jealous or wad... I also dun care wad u told others , and i also dun care bout whether u like others now a not... cos i dun wish to care anymore.. Tired , Sick. I once loved u , but maybe its time i gave up... its very difficult to coax u. You wan me to change , not to get angry over small things , but lie'ing to me is small ? If its considered small , den i've got nothing to say...u promised me u will never lie to me again , whether got or bad reason , but u still did... and it was within a month that u lied to me.  Its ok if u think i am a jerk or wadeva , as i am not going to care. After lie'ing to me , u expect me to trust u even more ? Tell me , Is it logical ? come'on , u are from the best class , u sld know better than me... somethings i know of are damn sickening , but i chose not to bring it up , but u always make me do so.. always making me so fed up.  Its not my fault that we ended up liddat. I've tried my best to change liao. i already dun get angry over those things... And yet u take advantage. I know u got alot of admirers out there , and i have none , but so ? i rather live a life of my own , be happy , and free. u may think talking to me loudly is not shouting , u may also think that i am always wrong , u also may think that i am the one controlling ur life. But have u ever thought of how u treated me ? U also made me not talk to girls wad , u also din want me close to girls wad.. any difference ? i dun see any.  Its time to make things clear. Go study , hard . Stop talking to me and u'll get over everything. treat me like a bastard or wadeva. So wad if i am always in the wrong , at least i got the courage to say " i am sorry " . Did u ever say that in ur first sentence ?  u expect me to coax u everyday , chase after u everytime. ever thought of how tired i get ?lol.. its ok now.. jus treat it that i was never in ur life and please dun ever return anything to me. Your books i will return it to u asap. meantime , dun call me le... after end of year exams over liao den we start talking again k ? i need time to settle down and study , i dun wish to fail again.  Wad a day i had ! haha. went to catch a movie with 2 ppl.(secret) lol !! studied chemistry halfway , some clever students din know how to do a maths problem , so i solved it for them , and they said i very " hao lian " .. LOL !!  write till here ba. Bye PEEPS !!  Priscila : thanks for cheering me on manz. Hope i am forgiven le ba ..
