I guess it wasn't all that bad, if you don't mind waking up at 6 in the freaking morning and having to walk there for half a freaking hour just to get there earlier then everyone else and you can't leave later because if you fall asleep you won't get up in time to get there. But anyways, i guess it wasn't all bad, we did get to play frisbee. Nothing's better then chasing a floating plastic disc around a field....hmmmmm....seems strangely like what a dog would like to do....er.....anyways! But in defence of hating that class, i'd just like to point out that we did have to do a project, in which we were forced to stand infront of the whole class of 57 people and make them do a warm-up. Needless to say my group failed horribly and just because I felt like being a prick I made the winning team run laps thus forcing them to hate me. But the one thing I hated the most was during our schedualed floor hockey game time i was visiously attacked by a 230lb, 6 foot 1 inch (maybe i'm exaggerating a little) behemoth whose brain consists of little more then a pile of brown goo.  He some got it into his thick skull that crosschecking me and hooking me with his hockey stick was fun.  And this put me into a situation i like to call a Matt Paradox(named after me of course). Basically, I had a "can't rat, can't spaz" crisis, i couldn't rat on him without looking like an overgrown wussie and without gargantuan over there pounding me flat while saying "Me stupid! Must squish everyone!", and i can't spaz because of the reason above and not to metion that fighting will cause a quick expulsion from the class and a waste of the 50$ spent to get in. So what do I do? I bitch on the net. Hoohah! But now I'm done. Peace Out -Matt
