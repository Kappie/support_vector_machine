       
      Just got back from Target where I brought a lot of stuff for my service trip next week.  I got tons of good snacks and a bunch of other stuff - I think I'm going to be eating better there than I do at home.   Visited LaSalle today.  The campus was pretty nice, but I didn't like it as much as I liked Temple.  My parents want me to visit St. Joseph's, but they don't have a communications program, so I'm not too sure.
