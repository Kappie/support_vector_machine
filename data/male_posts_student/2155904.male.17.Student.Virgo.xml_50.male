And for the most part he will be talking about Kaley Evanger from here on out.  I don't care if you readers get angry about what I say or if you find me the gayest person alive.  If by reading these words you don't like me then that is fine because you really shouldn't.  So to start off with, tonight was one of the best, if not the best, night of my life.  This Christmas party blew every other party ever thrown out of the water.  Taylor was an awesome hostess and I love her.  Kelsey and all of the rest of the ladies who helped out did a wonderful job and I love all of you.  Your kindness means so much to me.  It really helps me out in troubled times.  Troubled times.  I guess that troubled times would be right now for me.  My life is great and I really have only one quarrel with it.  My love life is not what I want.  At times there is no worse feeling than looking up at my monitor at the stunning beauty of my love in her spectacular senior picture.  She lights up my day more than anyone could imagine.  Tonight was absolutely amazing because of her.  Right from the start of the night we talked and were close to each other.  It only escalated as the night went on.  Gingerbread house making brought us closer than before.  We made our own house and we pictured having babies together and them growing up in it.  There is nothing I want more that that.  Looking into her eyes as she told me that gave me the warmest feeling one could ever hope for.  Her gentle, kind, and warm soul shone through to me at that very moment.  We laughed and giggled and played together while making the house and suddenly realized that everyone had left us from the table and that we were the only ones still making a house.  I had an opportunity, albeit mighty slim, to go under the mistletoe and pray that she would be caught under it with me but this did not formulate.  Instead we went back downstairs to join the rest and this is the moment I regret most about the whole night.  Then we sat next to each other and ate pizza.  Following, we watched some tape of Karaoke Night which she laughed to.  Then we went caroling.  And what a miracle of the holiday season this caroling was.  We locked arms and pranced around without a care in the world.  Our bodies were one as we looked at each other and then back at the surprised members of each household as we sang out our hearts and put on a show to be remembered.  We chatted and laughed and locked arms more as we went from house to house.  We thought of funny sayings and told them to each other and made the other laugh uncontrollably.  The singing continued and we went to her house.  Her parents answered the door and how I only wished that I could see them more often because it meant that I would be with Kaley.  And also how I wished they could be my parents-in-law one day.  I pictured how merry and bright our future holidays could be.  And then she reminded me that I still had not gotten to see her bedroom.  And I remarked how she would have to invite me over another time for me to see the roses that I had given her years ago when I first (this may sound bold but...) fell in love.  Then we went back to Taylor's and we sat next to each other and opened up our white elephant gifts.  After that exchange we layed next to each other on the floor and watched Home Alone in the dark.  As she fell asleep next to me I wanted more than anything in the world at that moment to roll over and just hold her.  To simply put my arms around her and feel her take each and every breath and to feel her heart pulsate as I gaze into her sleeping eyes.  But I knew that this could not happen.  Then as the minutes ticked away my heartbeat would rise incessantly and then calm with thoughts of her overtaking any actions occurring in the movie.  When the movie ended and most of the guests filed out, Kaley rose and went to Taylor's room to gather her belongings to leave.  I felt what I have felt so many times in my life.  The pain and sudden realization that I do not have what I want so badly to have flooded me.  It overtook me.  I just was hit by that singular fact that she is not mine.  Then I got up and trailed into the bedroom.  She got all her stuff and we hugged as she was about to leave.  Then I walked with her to the door upstairs and she put on her shoes and that was it.  She said goodbye and I said I hoped we could see each other before school started back again.  But oh how I wanted to chase after her and tell her how much I just wanted to throw all of her things on the ground and kiss her.  I do not know how I can hold back all of the feelings that rush me so blindingly but yet somehow I do.  And I know that is how it will be.  She exited my sights and I returned to Taylor's room where I sat in a chair and snuggled up with the naked 32" Walker Doll that Sicily had bought.  It would do for that time at least.  Taylor and Kelsey and Sicily tried to comfort me and assure me that I was a wonderful person.  Kelsey tried to tell me to just confess my love for her and then just get beat up by Mark but then have somebody go back and beat up Mark.  But this won't happen.  Why would Mark get jealous of me or want to beat me up unless he had a reason to.  And right now he does not have a reason to so he need not worry.  Taylor told me how Kaley loves how much I love her.  That would be great for me if only she loved me too.  So I sat and sulked in my own hopes and aspirations.  I knew that my night was over and that I would only get so many more opportunities.  Kaley means the world to me and if anything happened to her I would be fraught with despair.  My world be flip-turned upside down.  What ever may become of my situation with Kaley.  Time will only tell but being the pessimist I am, I fear for the worst.  My love for her not being returned.  Right now I really want to tell her how much I love her.  I want to take her in my arms and touch my nose to her and profess my undying adoration.  How can I ever do this?  I never see an opportunity fit to disclose such personal details such as this.  I need to call her up and get together with her.  Alone.  And just tell her how I feel from beginning to end without any interruptions from anything.  I want to hold her hand.  I want to feel the blood course through her veins.  I want to be one with her and never let go.  Kaley, you have my heart.  Can I ever have yours?
