       
      My days have consisted of at least 12-14 hrs of sleep since I've been back.  I bough sandwich materials and made myself a sandwich for lunch today.  Which concert should I go to this weekend? Defiance or Guttermouth? I'd prefer Guttermouth, but at least I'd get to hang out with Crystal at Defiance.  I get to hang out with the Cambridge girls tonight. That's always fun.  ***
