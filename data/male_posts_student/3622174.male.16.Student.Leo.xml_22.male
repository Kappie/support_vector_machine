My intent with this is to get Digital Lust back on its feet, especially since we've been WAY up in hits since my Spiderman 2 impressions the other day. So, if you are interested in helping out with Digital Lust, email me a resume with the following criteria:  First Name (for Blogspot purposes): BlogSpot Username: Age: Email Address: Blog Address:  And then a writing sample. In 100 words or more, write up a review of a game, or a tip for something related to technology or videogames. Cheats, Photoshop tricks, anything. We'll take it! I'm looking for at least two people, and I need to have them hired by tomorrow afternoon, since I am leaving on Monday. I want to make Digital Lust even bigger than ever, so, getting a small staff would be crucial to this. So, if you are interested in writing for me, email your resume to me at  urlLink shoxx5@gmail.com . I will be checking my email very frequently today and tomorrow, so that I can hire you. You'll then be added to the team for Digital Lust, and then you can start helping me out. Help is greatly appreciated, and I could definitely use it, since I'm going to be away for the next two weeks, and then school starts again. So, if you're interested, just email me, and I'll hire you!
