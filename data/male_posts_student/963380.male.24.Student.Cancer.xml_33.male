So we got my dad this cabinet - it's all nice and glass and so on. I'm just downloading new scanner drivers for my parents on their machine - their getting close to 200 kbps from hp - that's extremely rare. I consider myself a fortunate soul to have seen such a miracle.  Well, as soon as this is done I'm off to the moose where Jeff is going to indulge my food based whims cause I'm carting him around to his car dealership tomorrow. Huzzah.
