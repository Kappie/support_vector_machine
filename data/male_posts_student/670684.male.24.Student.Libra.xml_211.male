I entered graduate school as a writer, and was told that my writing was very good, and would be much better if I knew how to write an adequate term paper.  Usually I would blame myself (I don't like blaming others...I can't control others, I can only control myself...I never have a problem falling during the trust fall, and I never have a problem catching either, but it is the catching that I worry about), but I was constantly given high marks on papers my last two years of college, and even encouraged to look into publishing.  There were other various sundries as well, stemming from diversity in a cultural and academic realm, as well as the community's distaste for any competition and parade of effort above all other variables (including content).  But I want to thank Centenary tonight.  Not just for four great years of social life (arguably the four best so far).  But for small group communication skills.  I worked so many offices, committees, classroom groups, student/faculty groups, and other hodgepodge notions that the ability to interact with and grow into a small group is strong in my mind.  Honestly, it feels good to do this.  Very good.  If writing doesn't work out, I know I want to teach.    The kids are great.  Some problems, but if there weren't I'd be bored and wonder what was wrong with all of them.  Quite intelligent.  I know more than they do, and could possibly be smarter than most of them, but to say that would be to say a lot, because these are some of the smartest folks around.    My mom is very smart, and so is my dad, all personal problems aside.  I suffered through a few years because of divorce proceedings, and my academic curve was slowed greatly, but it came back together over the past eight or nine years.  And I can thank my friends for that.  I am fortunate to have incredibly bright and intelligent friends, few of whom think inside the normal plateau.  I was talking to Ben, one of the TAs, about globalization today, and he mentioned The Nexus and The Olive Tree, a pro-Globalization book.  I'm not anti-globalization, but I'm definitely not for it, and most of my readings and study come from the anti side.  "I like to get the other side," I said.  "It's tough to think that way," he said...Ben is one of the more positive folks I've met in a long time, especially for his age and knowledge level.  "Not so much," I said, "most of my friends are conservatives.  And those who aren't don't think about things like I do, or like most people do."    I should give Centenary and my friends a kick-back for enabling me to handle this job.  But I won't.  The knowledge of a job well done should suffice!  =)
