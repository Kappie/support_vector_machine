I'll be optimistic and say this year was a successful one at that.  Nonetheless, Journalism trip is coming up soon on the 7th of this month so that will be a lot of fun.  Seeing some friends and Mrs. Garcia will be pretty fun and I've been stuck at home most of the time so yay get out of the house and away from it all.  Found some good songs over the past few days so been rocking to those haha well I'm running out of things to say and I haven't even put this on my profile yet but I'll do so soon enough I suppose nonetheless, I'll see you around town.
