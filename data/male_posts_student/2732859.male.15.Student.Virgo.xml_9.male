In it he offers a truce to Europe if they pull out of the Mid- East.  In other news, today there is reaction from the Arabs to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon meeting with Bush yesterday and them agreeing to pull out of the Gaza strip completely, Israel retaining some settlements in the West Bank, and not recognizing the "Right of Return" for Palestinian refugees.  I have to say that this is one thing that I agree and support Bush on.  Israel is the only democracy in that region of the world and America needs to support it.
