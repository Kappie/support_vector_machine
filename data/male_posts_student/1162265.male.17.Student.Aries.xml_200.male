I dressed up in a Jersey and some weird baggy shirt, and I answered the door for halloween (actually I also had a black bandana on) and some kids from Newark (I guess since they looked old enough to be in High School and I'd never seen them around) asked if I was a blood, and if I was wearing a throwback.  Wow.  Remind me never to dress up in crazy hip-hop clothes again.  Please, remind me.  No talking to Asha this weekend.  I think her parents were pissed at her or something.  So sad.  So sad.  And Degrassi this weekend.  Holy Madre de Dios in Heaven.  It was crazy, Craig has a falling out with Ashley (they were gonna have Sex, but Ash is bipolar) so he ends up screwing with Manny in his garage (not litterally screwing) but you get the point.  Haha, and Allie was concerned about my Jamaican weed comment.  I'll make everyone aware, that I've never smoked Jamaican weed, or for that matter anything from Jamaica.
