I arrived late, and there were a whole bunch of non-youth group people there.  They told me to make sandwiches.  Then Evan *Eckart and I played a bizzare game about dinosaurs.  We got on a bus, and I was sitting next to Heather *Haywood.  We were talking, and somehow we ended up kissing a few times.  So of course, Kevin beat me up.  I don't really remember any more.
