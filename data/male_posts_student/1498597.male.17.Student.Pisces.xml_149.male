As you may know (if you check the  T.E.W.  and look at the posting times), there is nothin' to really blog about right now.  I guess I can bore you with my weekend, hmm?    Well, the highlight of this weekend was today, Sunday.  I went to  Book Off  with  Naoki , his older brother  Joe , and their Romanian friend  David .  That store  Book Off  is really somethin'!  I must've gotten lost since I had no idea what to look for or how to read some of the signs.  Lucky that  Naoki  was there, huh!?  Well,  Book Off  is a  Japanese book  (Duh!)  store , where they sell comics, books, videos, and DVD's alike!  It was really great, since  Naoki  was able to swipe a  Kirby manga  and I spotted a couple of CD's from bands I recognized ( Bad Religion, NOFX, The Sex Pistols ) and some I didn't!   Naoki  pointed out the various  Pokémon  soundtracks.  We also had a fruitless search for  "Suupa Mario-kun"  (literally  Mr. Super Mario ).  Its too bad that we had no luck finding a  Mario manga .  Better luck next time huh?  Oh yeah, there was this guy at the checkout counter that had to say somethin' whenever somebody came into the store...poor guy had to say it over and over again!   Next, we headed on over to the  Marukai Market , where  Naoki  had to pick up a few necessities...No big there I guess, except for the various products that had  Engrish  on them.  Some were  Flavono  chewing gum,  Calpis  drink (cow piss?),  Nudy Clean  shower gel,  No Time  chewing gum, and (my personal favorite)  Elis  ( Elyse!? )  Maxi Pads .  Well, that was that...and they dropped my off at my house.  Then I had to go run some errands.  First, I headed out to the  Corona Public Library  to renew some books and check out some new ones.  I renewed  1984  and  Keep the Aspidistra Flying  by  George Orwell  and picked up  Down and Out in Paris and London  (also by  Orwell ) and  China and Japan: Myths and Legends  by  Donald A. MacKenzie .  Maybe some book reviews are in order?  Well,  Operation: Revolution  has yet to go underway (I still haven't decided to do it or not) so just stay tuned ok?  I then headed to  Petsmart  to pick up fish supplies.  On weekends they have dogs, cats, puppies, and kittens up for adoption.  One day I wanna adopt one of those fuckers...they're just so damn cute!  Anyway, I managed to pick up some variety fish tablets and a little container of bloodworms...my  clown loaches  will absolutely love those!    Skip a few hours forward and here we are!  Well, thats it for now.  Sorry if this blog wasn't exactly excitin', but oh well...this blog serves many purposes, and being a journal is one of them!  Hey, I didn't really cuss a lot in this one...ok...shit, fuck, whore, slut, fucker, motherfucker, son of a bitch, cocksuckin', saggy tits, nasty nipple, pillow bitin', pussy licker, dick sucker, cum guzzlin', jizm squirt!  I made it up to you!  More to come...!
