While reading through my PDL, I then came across the verse Hebrews 3:13, which reads:  "But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called Today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness."  I found it nice that there was such a nice verse in the Bible that basically summarizes *in my mind* to "Keep your heads high, and always be there for one another as long as there is a tomorrow." However me being me, I like to read the full chapter of verses that interest me. Hebrews Chapter 3 isn't all that happy though. In fact, the majority of the chapter is about the gloomy end you have if you don't believe.  I then started to think, and then eventually referenced to NIV version *NASB is a bit difficult to understand, big words* and then prayed for guidance. Prayer never fails. Nor does NIV...it's proven to me time and time again that it is much more understandable than NASB...but I use NASB more because I need a bigger vocab. Anyways to the point...  As I was reading the chapter, and reflecting, it really boggles my mind on how ignorant people really are. It hurts even to think about it at times. Now I may be a hypocrite it seems while writing this as I can be ignorant too, but no one's perfect, and I can still give out advice. I'm happy though at least I never ignored the opportunity in believing in God in my life, and I can see him doing so much in my life everyday. It hurts all the time though to see so many of my friends live their daily lives without even knowing how much God does for them backstage.   This isn't a new issue though. In the story that Hebrews refers to *the crossing of the Red Sea, Moses, etc...it's in Exodus* the Israelites, even seeing countless miracles *the 10 plagues, the Egyptians drowning in Red Sea, etc.* they STILL don't see how caring God is, and time and time again, complain about the lack of care they are getting, and still rebuked the God that led them out of Egypt. Despite all this though, God still loves them, even 'till today. It's pretty cool how despite the fact many of his children rebuke him and do such bad things in His eyes, he still loves each and everyone of His children, and still hopes each and everyone of us will see and believe He is the Lord. What an awesome loving Father God really is. I wish that after 2000 years, humans could change this bad habit of ignoring God.  It seems as though the Bible never ceases to teach me new things =).  Haven't shared a devo in a while, and the stuff I read really got me thinkin', hope it does the same for those who read it. As for my day...  Well I tore down previous posts about my day, so yet again, I'll write it in one big post.  I got up around 10am this morning being awakened by a phone call. At first I thought it was another annoying telemarketer, or some really annoying friend who would dare call me at 10am. Well after the answering machine picked up, and I realized it was for volunteer...  HELLO!??!?!?!?!?!  Yeah I quickly picked up the phone as I am in dire need for hours haha. So I'll be at Masonville Library doing Craft prep for a day and then surveying there for two days. So much fun...at least I get hours, and it's nice giving back to the community as the saying goes. So yeah my day started like that, and afterwards, dragged myself out of bed and headed downstairs for my welcoming breakfast of leftover pizza. Whoo.  Afterwards chatted around on MSN for a bit, lost to Maisie 3 times out of 4 in the Minesweeper Flags game on MSN, and then had to go to Belle Air to return my trombone, exiting the room with a glorious tumble out of my compy chair.  Getting to Belle Air, it took me two hours to do the full process of returning my trombone, and eventually purchasing it. Here's a rough breakdown of how it happened:   230pm-240pm:Drive to Belle Air. 240pm-245pm:Paperwork and stuff to return trombone. 245pm-3pm:Tried out the trombones I was thinking about purchasing. Went with Yamaha. 3pm-345pm: Mom haggled the price down from $700 to $660. During this time I would look at guitars, cymbals, and nearly knock down a drumstick rack, which luckily I didn't. Chinese people seem to LOVE to haggle, and in the end got tuning slide grease and a spray bottle for trombone slide w/ my purchase. Didn't wanna rip Belle Air off THAT much. 345pm-355pm: Drive home.   As usual my mom went to watch the stupid Soap Opera w/ my Grandma, that one called...PASSIONS that's right. Ugh I can hear the stupid theme song everyday coming home from school, and over the summer...everyday either upstairs, or downstairs. Ugh why did the world ever create such retarded TV shows? Well anyways, during this time I ate, lounged around the house, and would be cleanin' and trying out my newly purchased trombone. It's shiny =). Chatted on MSN for a bit again, then went to drum for around 40 minutes or so. Also, I'd spend an hour file sharing with Maisie for some reason...we were both REALLY bored so we tried everything that MSN can do...where most don't work unfortunately. This afternoon between 4-7 was pretty lifeless when I think about it. I drummed, tromboned, and MSNed haha.  Afterwards I was going to go workout with Marcello, but he didn't call back until 830 so screw that. Then I thought "why not ball?" So while talking to Jason on the phone, we finally both agreed to go to UCC...until my mom reminded me about dinner.   "SO THAT'S WHY I FEEL SO HUNGRY" I thought to myself. I had somehow managed to forget dinner ehehehe. So yeah ate, and didn't go to UCC haha.  Afterwards showered, and then did the devo as shown earlier.  Today I think was an awesome day. Got a reply from WLAC regarding coffeehouse *90% it's a go,* read an awesome devo, got a new trombone, Josh finally got the green light for our domain, and of course....T-MAC IS A ROCKET! Why Houston is now my favourite team along with Dallas =)...actually I've always liked Houston for Yao, but with T-Mac now...they'll be awesome next season. Shaq still may go to Dallas which is cool, so heads high for both teams =).  Anyways yeah...beat Maisie at checkers then, and now...yeah I'm done posting.  Sleepin' early tonight since tomorrow got a big day ahead of me. Amp shoppin' w/ Josh and Ginnie, lunch w/ 'em also and then watching Spider Man 2 and chillin' at the mall. So..in conclusion...  Later boys and girls.
