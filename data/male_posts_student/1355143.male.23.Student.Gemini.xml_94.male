I suppose he will in my mind, at least until I see him in his natural habitat. But for now, it is the kings of Barcelona that I will remember, the princes of Scobie's, the lords of Danzatoria. Svana, congrats on the graduation, even though I could not begin to pronounce nor comprehend your new title. I barely mastered "car" in Icelandic. And no worries about the length of the blog...since the response has been piss-poor, feel free to type all you want. That will give us sufficient browsing material for the weekly hiatus between blogs. What the hell is everyone else doing with their lives that they don't have time to blog? Vegard I can understand, but where's everyone else? Perhaps people need a reminder, Ulli. Caroline did say she was interested given proper coaxing (aka information concerning signing on). The others could even blog in Spanish or Italian if they want...I'm sure we could figure out some of it. Steffen and Valerie have no excuse with their English skills, nor does Magnus, who is at times more American than the Americans and more English than the English. Funny sidenote...I told Conor that Magnus was Swedish and he was like "What!!??" Conor thought the entire time that Magnus was American. Apparently he's got a good accent (or Conor's just deaf and unobservant--or observative, as Manolo would say, right A?). I'm in the process of paying a fine for a speeding ticket, as well as registering for the Drivers' Safety course that is required to keep the violation off my record. Gas prices have tamed down a bit, though I suppose I shouldn't complain considering the fact that we get nearly 4 liters for $1.80 and consider that high. I do think I'll buy one of Honda's new hybrids when I get around to buying a car. But for now my old one will have to do. I suppose I should study a bit now...I've got 2 exams on Thursday. Summer classes suck, I tell you. La culpa es mia for registering, I suppose. Anyway, stay Euro all.  Ciao, Tim
