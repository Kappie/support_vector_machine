The metal detector caught many of the Columbia students off guard. After the test, which by the way I felt I did well being I didn't study much. I def broke 1100 which is great considering I studied like two days. Next time in October I plan to break 1300 but that's far away so let's get back to the car wash. I washed cars, held signs, shook money cans, and it was brought to my attention that I was the lead captain during the most successful car wash we've ever had. This is really only because I had to control some people who having more fun than washing cars. Hitting eachother with soapy sponges and soaking others with the hoses. At this point the cars started piling up due to the loss of work. At one point we had 11 cars lined up and they were still playing around. I'm one for jokes, many know that but I remember it's work before play. I might crack jokes but they relate mostly to what I'm doing and if something needs to be done I'm going to do it and then have some fun. I was surprised at Martha. She seemed a little too caught up in the fun and of course when I asked her to stop she got me with the sponge. May be she was under the influence of Alex... Or maybe I'm just giving Alex too much credit. Of course my method-Work first play later came into affect when it was over. Oh yeah Martha got it. She was literally soaked(She was wearing a white shirt...DAMN that girl is sexy).  I watched the Belmont Stakes not long ago and Smarty Jones was predicted to win the Triple Crown and become a legend. But he was upset by a new guy...Someone that no body had heard of. Someone who had run the race before. Birdstone. I'm going to remember how he did it. I feel like I'm in the same position with Moorestown and Tracey. I'm going upset everyone. I'm going to take them all by surprise. I'm going to push my self to no end to succeed. Those guys are going to hate me for how hard I'm going to push them. They will want to stop and want to quit but they will respect me for how hard I push them. They'll thank me later. I like to compare competition to battle so therefore my thought is parallel to this quote-  "Battle is the most magnificent competition in which a human being can indulge. It brings out all that is best; it removes all that is base. All men are afraid in battle. The coward is the one who lets his fear overcome his sense of duty. Duty is the essence of manhood."                  -General George S. Patton
