There is no way they would be capable of putting the entire book into a movie.  However, if I hadn't read the books, some parts would have been a little bit confusing.  The only disappointment I had with the movie was that they never really explained the map in full detail.  If you are they type of person who only goes to see the movies, or if you just haven't been caught up in the HP frenzy, then I highly suggest you read the books. The movies are good but they would never be able to give the books the justice they deserve. The first book takes a while to get into, but it is definitly worth the energy. Rachel Penny
