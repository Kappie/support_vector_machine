Autobiography , Sloan  I'm writing "young and gifted"  In my autobiography  I figured, who would know  Better than me   I'm certainly the former  But I'm not so much the latter  But no one's gonna read it  So I'm sure it doesn't matter   When you find that you're the former  Take pride in how you form  And when you find that you're the ladder  Don't let those people walk under you   I'm writing "sharp and adult"  With my finger on the steam  On the mirror in my bathroom  While I'm applying shaving cream   Which would suggest that I'm the foamer  But how can I be the lather  And something tells me  It's the opposite I'd rather   When you find that you're the foamer  Be careful what you foam  When you find that you're the lather  Don't shave too high, you'll regret it later  La la la la   I've stayed in school this long  But still no one will tell me why  They figured who would know  Better than I   I know I'm a conformer  But I'm sure it doesn't matter  My new friends are all adults  And my old friends all have scattered   When you find you're a conformer  Take pride and swallow whole  But if you're trying to climb the ladder  Don't let people walk over you  Because that's just what they'll do  Don't let people walk over you  Because that's just what they'll do  that is all... i need to pass out.
