My router seems to stop all incoming traffic, even though I open port 80, enable DMZ on my IP and disable the hardware SPI firewall. Meaning everyone part from me get a 404 error. Its enough to make me throw it out the window. I even registered http://dragontail.serverbox.org, which directs all traffic to my IP. Shame it all gets blocked though >:(  Me and Beckett have agreed to develop a template site for Black Ghost, while James is continuing to fiddle about with Flash trying to create his pr0 movie. Only problem is he is on a 56k, and hes never gonna get the right resources. Well, thats his excuse. Han is, well, not doing much. Great. I'm having some doubts to see what he is willing to produce. Better late than never I suppose.  I swear, this stupid router is gonna piss me off till I throw my ultra heavy goldfish bowl 17" monitor at it. What else can I do?
