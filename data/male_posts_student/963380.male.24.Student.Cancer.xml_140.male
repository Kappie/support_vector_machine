I'm insured through work - something I wasn't quite sure of on Monday after Kevin (hereafter to be referred to as Kev-bo the Master Cockgobbler - well, maybe not) yelled at me for a solid two hours. You see, there was this man. This man - let's, for argument's sake call him Jeremy Ribideau - returned a camera to my store. Now I can prove, circumstantially, that he fucked us. I didn't accuse him of it, but he fucked us. I caught him and asked him if he had anything to explain. Guilt got the better of him and he threw a fucking tantrum on me. Later he wrote a letter to head office (well, no names, so I'm relatively free, but whatever). Later he comes in and we have some words - there's a disparity here (much like his complete bullshit letter) about what happened - he claims I used some rather strong language, which I have the good sense not to do. This, of course, is cause for Kevin to ignore me and shout for two hours until I slapped some fucking sense into him. I did it fairly sharply which could have landed me squarely in unemployed (no big deal really) but instead snapped him the fuck out of the land of grossé stupidité.  The DLA is coming along nicely in Uru. Hopefully we'll see the webpage finished tomorrow. I'm collaborating on a Sound and Light entry - well, we're thinking about it. We'll see. I did the writeups for dniactivities.org yesterday. I'm just waiting to see what more work I can do.  My teeth hurt like hell - this brings me back to my original point - My orthadontics, which I originally thought would be leaving my person sometime around December this year - well they'll actually be parting my company sometime around April. Fuck yes. Straight teeth roxx0r my b0xxors.  madam im adam is a palindrome.  I've started to re-read Foundation. Along with Dune it's one of the great Sci-fi mindjobs. At least it's not more Phillip K. Dick - that fellow had problems (has? surely he's dead, right?) with memory - everything's always about memory alterations. Then again, it may be something to look to.  It's hella cold today. Wrap up for god's sake.  I really like CSI. Like, REALLY REALLY. I could care less for Miami - Horatio? Fuck, why is that man still in television? However, Gil Grissom - I really care about him. I recently saw two episodes which quoted ideas from the Tomas Harris Lecter Trilogy - fascinating in that Will Petersen played Will Graham (later Played by Ed Norton) in the original Manhunter (Red Dragon the First). But I really like him. I'd like to work with him. Some people just strike you the right way. He does.  Currently Listening to: The Dave
