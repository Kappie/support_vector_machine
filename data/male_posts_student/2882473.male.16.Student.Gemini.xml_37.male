Anywho, I'm now on Easter Holiday, woo! But that means lots of revision, ney. Supposedly. I had better do some at some point. Today was very normal. Had an assemly during half of first lesson, and then my class watched some of a really weird film: Battle Royale. Very sick, possibly disturbing. However I would quite like to see the end at some time. Had half day, school finished at 13:00, home by 13:45. My God, I'm bored, and I've only been home 3 and a half hours. My Easter holiday will be dull. I have nothing to say here, so I'll be orff then, bye all.
