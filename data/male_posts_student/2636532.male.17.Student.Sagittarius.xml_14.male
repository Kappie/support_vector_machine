Truly it’s one of the most pathetic ways to live, like at least a homeless person has an excuse to be doing nothing. I guess it’s not all bad, but only if you’re easily amused.  For instance, right now I’m finding myself amused by flicking on and off a flashlight.  That’s not that bad you say?  Well to top it all off there are no batteries in it, in fact there isn’t even a light bulb in it or even an end on it. So basically all I’m doing is playing with a plastic tube with a switch on it (shut up right now all you sick sick dirty minded people, this is no place for such thoughts.  Wait!  What am I saying? This is the Internet, of course it is!).  All I’m saying is that if you live in a small town, do yourself a favor, grow up move to the city and get rich.  Trust me it’ll do wonders to your life. But if the city life isn’t for you, you have 2 options…. 1. Make your computer your best friend, or 2. Learn to shoot and hunt gophers -Matt
