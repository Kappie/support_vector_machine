Most of it seems trivial to the outside world, but to me it's important. Sorry this is so vague, but it's one of those things you need to write down but can't really delve upon in a public forum. If you're close to me then you probably know this already or I'll tell you. Otherwise you can pass this over and continue on as planned.   Update, 8/3/04 : I'm good now. I just was having one of those moments when you really don't need people bothering you. Mom came home yesterday afternoon after work and we got into one of those arguments. We've worked things over now, and there is some stuff  I  need to work out, but I'm good. Sometimes you just need to be alone and clear your mind.
