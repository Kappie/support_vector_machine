Somehow in the last couple of days, I've gotten myself in to this shitty little depression. It didn't help today that I got bitched out by my friend for drinking too much. But seriously, I don;t know what the deal is. Hopefully it's one of those little things that will resolve itself in a week or two. Preferably before school starts on the 18th. Eww. I think a good boyfriend could solve all my problems right now. Anyone know a good gay boy in Denver? Help me out.
