I’m too lazy to even plan ahead for things.  I always wait until the last minute to actually do something.  At times like that I want to scream.  At times, nothing makes sense.  Now it seems like more and more of the time it feels like this.  I don’t get it.  I wish I could trigger something that would make me better.  I want to care more about things.  Whenever I feel that way, I just don’t care.  It’s the only way that I can feel OK at all.  Otherwise I’m worried about my problems.  I’ve found that lately, I’ve been thinking about things that are quite mindless.  Mainly, I think because I can’t do much of anything else.  When you have so much on your mind, you can’t think.  The last couple weeks have been bad for me.  I really lack consistency in my life.  I seem to have mood swings quite a bit.  I’m on top of the world then not even close a couple hours later.  I’m not sure what to make of it.  That combined with my schedule and homework makes things horrible.   It seems like I’m always doing something for basketball whether I want to or not, during the season and off-season.  In that time, when do I get a break?  I never seem to get enough sleep.  Having to get up at 6 for work in the gym in the morning is not very fun.  And the change in time makes it an hour worse.  ‘ I am just a worthless liar. I am just an imbecile. I will only complicate you. Trust in me and fall as well. I will find a center in you. I will chew it up and leave, I will work to elevate you Just enough to bring you down. ’ (Tool – Sober)  Seems almost like everything is trying to elevate me in a way then right after bring me down to a state of depression.  I doubt it’s on purpose, but it seems that way.  Nonetheless it’s probably the cause of my depression.  Sometimes I wish I could have silence.  Utter complete silence.  Just to rest in peace for a moment or two without thinking.  I doubt that is possible.  I wish it were.  Then maybe I would feel a bit better after waking up.  The following is some lyrics from the song I think is today’s song of the day.  It’s “The Patient” by Tool:  ‘ Be patient. I must keep reminding myself of this.  And if there were no rewards to reap, No loving embrace to see me through This tedious path I've chosen here, I certainly would've walked away by now. And I still may.  Gonna wait it out. ’
