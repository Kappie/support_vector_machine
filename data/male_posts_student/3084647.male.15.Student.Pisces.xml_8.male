None of them looked particularly interested in what they were doing, except perhaps one guy at the corner who was busy with an Arithmancy exercise. The others were staring ahead glumly, propping their heads up on their hands, playing unenthusiastically with their parchment and quills.    “We have  three  tests this week,” Barnabas said slowly.    “Don’t remind us,” Cheryl moaned.    The others nodded and sighed. Only Matt looked up from his Arithmancy graphs and frowned. “Well then, why not just study for them?”    They glared at him, and he fell silent.    “School is crap, honestly,” Hu Ping complained. “Especially with such disgusting teachers.”    Minellus Molekiw had, in about a week, introduced about 10 new school rules, most restricting the way students could dress. The girls no longer dared to wear ankle socks for fear of spring checks. The last time someone from Ravingclaw got caught, they had had to spend an hour in the dungeon disemboweling toads. Yi Fan did not dare to keep his hair long. Matt, of course, kept his fringe in check. Eunice had to resort to changing the colour of her shoes to white – or, as Professor Molekiw put it, 75% white.    Matt stifled a large yawn. He placed his parchment down on the table. “I’m done,” he said through another yawn. “’Night.”    “We’ll return you your essays tomorrow,” Muthu said with a small smile. Matt nodded and went off to the guys’ dorm. His essays – Transfiguration and Astronomy, remained untouched on the table. No one could be bothered to copy them now. They’d rush tomorrow morning, as always.    Cheryl felt a bit guilty. This past week she’d been barely coping with classes. She wasn’t the only one – in fact there were plenty of people doing worse than her. At least she had understood Professor Helmi’s convoluted Arithmancy lessons while Minyu was swimming in her confusion. Her Transfiguration and Potions were only just passes, so far. Her Befuddlement Draught had gotten a C, a grade she suspected she got only because Professor Molekiw didn’t like her. She had been one of the many who had to have extra practice on Vanishing Spells. Though she hadn’t fallen asleep in any more Defense Against the Dark Arts classes, she had a feeling Professor Siva was now observing her every movement in his class, something she hated. She needed to be free. She needed somewhere where grades didn’t matter.    “Kiw has just returned the essays,” Eunice said, sounding remarkably happy. She had been named Griffindoor’s Potions rep, and seemed to be really enjoying the job. Why, Cheryl had no idea. Eunice now proceeded to give out the essays. When she reached Cheryl, she gave a wry smile before placing the parchment in front of her friend.    Cheryl looked down. She had gotten a C. Again.    Quickly, she stuffed the paper into her bag (she had forsaken her sling bag as those weren’t allowed in school) before Barnabas could ask. Before she could do that, however, Yi Fan had already held up his paper for the rest to see. He had gotten an F. An F-, at that.    “It’s a record,” he said proudly.     ----------    The next morning, Rachel Kwan and Sunny Ng, Griffindoor fourth-years, were walking down from their dormitory to the Great Hall. They were clad in school uniform (robes were necessary only on Mondays) which consisted of skirt and shirt. They were talking animatedly, not bothering anyone, when –     “Oh no!!” Rachel squealed, as she tried to pull Sunny and turn around.     “Excuse me, my dears,” a cold voice called out from behind them.     They both winced, and turned round. Slowly.
