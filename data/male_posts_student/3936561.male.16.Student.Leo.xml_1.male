Then I went back on the computeruntil 11PM, when the computer crashed and I said, "Screw this, I'm going to bed." Only, because my Grandma was staying over, so I got to sleep in the basement on the couch. So I stayed up until 3AM, because TNT was showing 3 of my favorite X-Files episodes. Anyways, I've so far recieved $75 for my birthday, plus $40 for what I earned at the garage sale. Also, I've found some fun mods: Galactic Conquest for Battlefield 1942, and Renegade Alert for C Renegade. Galactic Conquest is Star Wars, and Renegade Alert is the CC:Red Alert universe. Later!
