People are watching "You Got Served" in the other room. Not really my cup of tea. Mix bad music, with bad acting, and a bad story line and that equals my worst nightmare. No offence to fans of the movie, though you might want to go see a psychiatrist for thinking that movie is good.  I need to read  Life of Pi  for English, I don't really mind since it's not that bad, but I just can't get myself to pick up the book.*sigh* And I still need to by a journal for it. I'm just too lazy for this stuff.  I feel stupid right now for writing this cause I doubt anybody would be reading this.
