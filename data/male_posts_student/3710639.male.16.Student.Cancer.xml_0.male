The Canadian Election happens in a few days time, and video segments like these are appearing more and more on the MuchMusic airwaves. They've dedicated a whole show called MuchVote 2004, which contains many segments like the one linked, to get the train of political thought rolling in an attempt to get viewers to vote. I thought I'd use this entry to elaborate on what some of the people were saying in this array of opinions.   People should be allowed to get married, regardless of sexual orientation.  Care to take that a step further? You're not really doing much to change or enforce whatever opinions I may have on same-sex marriages.   Marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman.  What? Are you kidding me? Marriage isn't sacred. Marriage is a joke. Example, Jennifer Lopez. If a marriage is so sacred, then how come more than fifty percent of them end in divorce?   It's always controversial when groups are given equal rights.  Like when blacks were given equal rights. I'm sure that sparked a lot of controversy within the general population (and I say general because I know that  some  racist groups were highly opposed to this idea, but not nearly on the level as gays gaining the right to marriage)   God meant for marriage to be between a man and a woman.  This according to the Bible. He also meant for marriages to last a lifetime, as well as many other things (which include sex being used only as a form of reproducing and not for enjoyment) which we don't follow.   For many of us, preserving the traditional defintion of marriage is important.  "For many." "Many" also get divorces, and that doesn't preserve marriage at all.   I don't support same-sex marriages, but I think it would still be possible to carry this opinion and still support my friends in gay relationiships.  That's like not allowing a black friend in the '60s and any time previous (in some cases later) to enter an all-white restaurant because of your "opinion". Whatever happened to equality between all people, equality which stretches to the realms of marriage and beyond?   What a person does in the bedroom is their own business. As long as it doesn't affect my life, then I don't really care.  A popular opinion among morons. The topic is gay  marriage , not gay sex. So many times have I heard people expressing this opinion when somebody decides to bring up same-sex marriage.   Family has to be preserved as an insitution for the country.  Okay fine, fair enough. But how will a same-sex relationship ruin a family in more of a way then 50% of all wedded couples divorcing?  Most of us have heard people saying things like this before. My stance on gay marriage is that I don't really care about it. It is not an issue that I am particularily concerned with, and I won't give a politician a vote based on his or her stance on same-sex marriage. As a matter of fact,I probably wouldn't give a politician any vote right now. Two more years until I can do that. I do understand that there will be a lot of people out there who will base their vote on what the candidates' view on gay marriage is, but that's just stupid. How about base it on something actually important, like health care and education, and not on something silly like preserving "tradition" (a tradition which has been heavily tarnished)? Many gays are probably basing their vote on this issue, which is reasonable, I guess. It's probably important to them. I wouldn't know. The city of Toronto has allowed same-sex marriage, and when a city that large is doing it, then it's only a matter of time before the rest of the world also allows it. So bide your time, and base your vote on something important.
