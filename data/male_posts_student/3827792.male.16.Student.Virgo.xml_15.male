Today is youth exhibition and feeling very tired coz woke up at 6.10am tis morning so feeling kinda xian now. But nonetheless, it was a great day with fun filled activity and chances for me to learn new things. Hmm... but poor adrian sim was the one suffering. Youth would run whenever they see him which somehow he does not know the reason. Youths in CTK comes in so many different pattern. From running away to lost looking, you name it we have it. Some of them on seeing us like they have seen some ghost that they run in the opp direction. Hehe, and i always got Edward my beach brudder to start a conversation before I cut in and fill in the details,  so i guess that is another kind of team work. And Thanks alot Edward if you are reading this. We also found out that my shi jie aka Vanessa look like a Hamster, not that we are bad or wat but if you look carefully at her she reali got the resemblance of a hamster to a high % of 92. So from now on she will be called ham ham. Haha..... Robin and a few of the guys and me had a great time tokin cork. and as u expected, the conversation in the end leads to us toking abt gals in church. Haizzz, wat to do guys wat. Hey I think I have written enulf abt things here, time for me to go
