It is shameful that the most powerful country in the world has employed individuals to "protect our freedom" by degrading and humiliating others. I have respect for those soldiers who have given their lives and who continue to put their lives on the line to help this country however I must express my anger and disgust at the fact that these soldiers would do these horrible things to people who are defenseless.  The scary part of all this is the fact that we only know this much, there is much more going on over there that we dont know and most probably wont know but Im sure it is worse than the pictures we saw on 60 Minutes.  Was this part of their military training ? This gives the United States even more reason to be hated by anyone and everyone outside of our borders.  The most disgusting part was President Bush's praise of the job Donald Rumsfeld is doing.......Rumsfeld the man who spear-headed the proposal to the UN about the war in iraq, the man who is micromanaging the war for the President. In essence the man who is responsible for the disgusting acts of US soldiers, is doing a good job ? My ass he is doing a good job...the fact is that if those prisoners had been american and other american soldiers were doing those things to them, rumsfeld and every field general would be out on their butts right now looking for work. If those prisoners were Americans President Bush would have fired good ol' Donald on the spot. But America with our arrogance will just sit back and watch as the Bush Administration continues to put this country into a gigantic hole, economically and most importantly morally.    Donald Rumsfeld should resign his position as well as be tried in an international war crimes court for crimes against the people of Iraq. As should those soldiers in those pictures and their commanding officers.  They should be tried by an international court because you and I know that if they get tried here in the US not a damn thing will happen. Bush's approval of Rumsfelds work is another way of condoning the horrible things that are happening in Iraq. If Bush cared about getting re-elected he wouldve fired Rumsfeld....but ol' Dubya doesnt have to worry cause he will parade Osama Bin Laden around just like he did Saddam Hussein and you know when that is gonna happen ? Oh, lets see.....Id say maybe the last 2 weeks of october......it will be before November 5th, ill tell you that much......by election time Bin Laden will have been miracously captured and Bush will be some kinda sick stupid hero....  If it wasnt obvious before that Bush was ruining this country it has to be obvious now. I would like to see someone defend the actions of the Bush Administration or the soldiers in Iraq for their actions and Bush's subsequent reaction, specifically the support of Rumsfeld. I ask anyone reading this, if you can vote for God's sake dont vote for Bush !!!
