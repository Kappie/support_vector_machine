Not only was it for the War on Terror, but the War on Drugs as well. It has the added bonus of ending Saddam's dependence on drugs. Maybe now he can get the treatment he needs.  Seriously, though. This is yet another reason Saddam was dangerous. Just as Hitler became irrational through his dependence on drugs, we can assume Saddam wasn't rational either. Did we want to leave someone so unstable in a position to harm us?
