And she dao me again..I'm  really really sorry ..hope that she can forgive me..I think I really irritated her..should let her cool down first.. But the thing is..I really love her..and I love her for who she is..not what she is.. Although my gf is much prettier , smarter , funnier , blah blah.. but she's really different from my gf.. I just can't explain it..she's a really nice girl..She's definitely my SoulMate.. I'll wait for her..even if she doesn't want me.. I'll still wait..  Quote of the day:  Life is the flower for which love is the honey. =)
