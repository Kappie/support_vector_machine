Anywho, noticing I have nothing better to post I will post this:    Yes, I went to bored.com and it recomended this 'Spin the bottle', so there ya go. Today was pretty lousy, did chores, took practice driver's tests, played DDR.  I did get to go see 'Without a Paddle', it was pretty funny.  Im gonna get some sleep now.  Talk to everyone when I have something to talk about. Until next time.  -EDIT- wtf? the link doesn't work.  oh, well
