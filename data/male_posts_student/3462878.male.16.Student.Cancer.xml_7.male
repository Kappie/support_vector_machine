Just a couple of points today, that I'll probably go on about for ages after.   Blisters suck ass! They really really do! Not only am I crap at sparring, but whenever I've got a bit of momentum going, do I then get pains in my feet! You'd think after a while, my feet would get used to bouncing slightly, but no, every time I really go flat out, my frigging little toes (on both fucking feet!) get totally kaned. It could be the way I spar, because I try to stay on my toes all the time, but in my opinion, that's the best way to fight (just in case you've gotta get out of the way quick), or it could just be me having soft feet. Anyway, they fooking hurt! Especially when you have to peel them off, firstly it looks sick, and second, it fooking hurts!   Punctures, grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. THERE'S NO NEED! Today, I was feeling pretty rraabbish to be quite honest. I mean, I had bad ass blisters on my feet, threatening my walking (seriously!), and punctures, so I had to walk everywhere. Well to tell the truth, I couldn't be arsed to walk for a little bit, so I just pumped up my tyre and tried to get home before it went down. Hey, it worked! Then the bad news was I actually had to fix the bugger! Nah, as I said, I couldn't be arsed, so mum just got me a new inner tube and tyre instead. Besides, it was really thin anyway, just a matter of time before it fucking blew up. Then came the bugger of getting the new tyre and inner tube in, which involved taking the entire wheel off. Ah well, to me it was worth it, that tyre was really thin as I said. Plus, now I know that I haven't missed any punctures. I did this morning. grrrrr. Dad woke me up at 7:00 (see earlier posts about sleep) to fix punctures, and it could have been because I was half asleep, but I somehow missed some more holes in my tyre. Which meant, as soon as I started biking, the tyre went down, which also meant I had to walk halfway to school. With blisters. Ouch.   Why is time goes slowest when you can't be arsed to do something? Take this situation right, sitting in an exam, finished the paper, about half an hour to go, no phone to mess about with, no books to read, no computer to play on. Basically I'm living about 100 years in the past. Bored outta my fucking mind. To me anyway, the only option is to draw on my hand, which usually involves a great big pattern that can sometimes 'grow' up my arm. There's also another option, which is basically staring into space, but then I look stoned, and when we get out, someone will probably say something to me. Humming or singing to myself can't work, mostly beause I'll probably shout out, and as we all know in exams, you've gotta shut the fuck up, especially in GCSE's  Meh, not as long and anger filled as the last one, meh, not much to complain about, I've nearly finished with all my rants.
