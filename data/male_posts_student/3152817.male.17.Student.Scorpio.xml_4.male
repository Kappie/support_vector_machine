What bothers me about all of this though, is the drama acted out by those who didn't even know him.  Just yesterday I listened to a group of girls argue with another girl because she suggested that it was Wade's fault.  The accident report showed that it was in fact Wade's fault.  He was driving well over the speed limit on wet roads, tried to pass the car in front of him and collided head on with an oncoming car.  It's tragic that someone so young had to die that way but it doesn't excuse the fact that it was his fault that 3 people are now dead.  Another thing that bugs me is the seemingly endless list of those missing school to attend his funeral.  A funeral is supposed to be for family and only very close friends.  The school shouldn't be taking a bus full of junior high kids to such a personal event.  Am I being insensitive? I don't think so. All I'm saying is that the list of those attending should have only been less than 1/4 of one page instead of a whole page front and back.  Most of those on the list didn't even speak to him while he was still with us.  I'm sorry he died, I'm sorry that his family and friends have to go through this hard time, but it ticks me off that ignorant people would take advantage of this situation just to get out of school for a day.  It's insensitive of them and it's rude to his family and to his real friends.   R.I.P. Wade
