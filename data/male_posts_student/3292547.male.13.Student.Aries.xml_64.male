Last time, when it was just me and my dad, I caught 6 and my dad caught 1.  We think the reason is that my g-dad feeds them in the evening and that's when we fished last time. We think it was too early when we went today. Anyway, we gave Avery both the fish to take home. Nothing for me but a blog story, but that's ok. =-)
