Everything seemed normal untill the afternoon bus ride, poring rain and thunder, windows down on bus, water pouring into bus, everyone was wild on the bus today, it was a definte change from the ordinary. As for nicki and kristen, well i really dont want to talk to them, they have changeed too much. The rest of my day was spent hanging out at the park not really doing much...........
