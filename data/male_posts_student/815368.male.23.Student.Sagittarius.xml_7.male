Let me just say, it was about time.  Anyway, enough kissing ass… So much has happened since I've last blogged.  I accomplished my goals this past semester at UTPA and I started setting new goals for this summer.  I'm also excited summer has finally come.  Now I have time to practice my violin, work out, and save money for a new car and a small trip to Houston with my girlfriend Gloria.
