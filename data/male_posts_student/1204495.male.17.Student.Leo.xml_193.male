But the basic jist of it is, i wrote this stuuupid letter *kicks self* which i should of never given to clare, but well when i wrote it, i was pretty ill, (wasn't in college, which isn't exactly like me) so clare read it, then showed it heather, that bit i can understand, but from what i've been told by various people heather then went and showed this letter to various people at my college, this is the bit i can't understand, because well it basically had nothing to do with those other people, as far as i'm concerned twas between clare and myself... Thats where the trust bit comes in, i thought i could trust heather, but well after that i doubt i can for a while, i mean what i don't understand is why show it to people whom it doesn't concern? ...its as though she doesn't care about what anyone else thinks. So thats the basic jist of it, i'll tell you a more detailed version some time, but for now i've got another thing on my mind as well, namely the fact that the upper bit of my left arm hurts for no reason at all, can't even break chocolate with my left arm cause it hurts :( oh wells, i'll just go to the doc and find out what it is, seen as its been like this for a few weeks :(  Anyways enough of me moaning!
