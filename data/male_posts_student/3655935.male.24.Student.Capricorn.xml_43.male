I was pleasantly surprised, and wanted to leave a comment on her blog just for sake of indirectly saying, "hey, I found your blog."  I realized this wasn't a good idea for a couple of reasons.  First, I haven't talked to this person in years.  It is possible that the last thing she wants is to communicate with me.  Second, I'm not exactly thrilled at the prospect of re-opening the door to resume normal communication.  My typical policy with ex-girlfriends is to burn all bridges.  This is possible when you leave the state.  ( Holy crap!!!  I just realized George Strait's song " urlLink All My Ex's Live in Texas " describes my life.  What a revelation! )  Despite the fact it was a cool discovery, it is an experience I will have to keep to myself.  ...and all of this brings back feelings of guilt.  Why am I so good at hurting nice girls?  I'm a bad person.  No female should be allowed to be nice to me.  I'm considering living the quiet life of a hermit so I cannot harm anyone.   Bad John!  Bad John!
