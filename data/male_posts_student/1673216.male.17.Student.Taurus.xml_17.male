So news news news...Oh ya! I'm going to homecoming dance and football game :D with a  TOTALLY  awesome person! So awesome that I shall ask out soon ::hint hint::...Well ya, soon enough huh? So ya that's pretty huge news for me, since I just normally don't do anything like this, and I had to explain it all to my parents and such, blah blah I don't really talk to them about my life much, so it was hard (but worth it for you! =P). So ya, some things might change in my life I hope, for the better I hope, and it will be cool I hope. Hope..Hope, I have always used this in my life...When my sister was dieing...I had hope. The hope didn't pull through but I had hope. I had hope throughout the whole years my parents were in a depression. I had hope when she was in the hospital still, and thereafter I have always had hope. She fuels my hope. I couldn't do it without you Ginger.. You had the one of the hardest lives I have EVER seen for your age, and I can't even fathom what you had to go through...Which makes me cry what happened...And the day it happened. I know a lot of people learned from this, as did I..Started the whole hope thing...Which is good...After that I am always going through a bipolar thing, but I still have hope.. I know I can do it...and you can help..And I'm not trying to sound sappy, or whiny, but I am tired and writing about this the best I can from the heart... I know you got to the famous people you wanted to see, and I know you are happy that you taught us all of this...And thank's to all you people (friends) that have helped me even though you didn't even know you did...You are all helping....John, Lauren, Scott S., Brian, Drew....thanks gus...and everyone else...thanks...thanks
