Fucking typical.  -  Of course, once I mention that Red vs. Blue is finally keeping on schedual, they start to lag behind on Episode 29.  Damn.  -  I like this new look.  A bit fuller, plus I decided to put a little picture of my guitar in there.  -  And to all of you who want to see that Alamo movie, I hate to spoil the ending, but they all die.  Sorry, I like that joke.  -  My DVD collection is growing, thanks to grandmum.  -  Wow, those above entries are really short.  Here's another one.  -  I'm so not looking forward to school tomorrow.  I might have to take a mental health day.  But, then again, I've missed enough school as it is.  My grades are accually doing well this semester, but I need to really raise my grade in Cranny's class.  I could do an extra project, which could boost me up a letter or two.  Or, I could accually do my homework.  But thats unheard of!  -  I'm really angry at my mother.  I need to get to River City Music because I need to replace some pads on Nikita (clarinet, long story), get some nylon strings for my Mexican guitarra, a slide, a stand, and a new hard case.  Some new picks would be nice too, I've already broken four of my five.  -  Everyone questions why I'm attracted to American Idol.  Well, I won't be once the two hot chicks are sent away.  I started to watch this, and there were a lot of them.  Now it's down to two, and one of them came awfully close to getting voted off, but instead, the unattractive one left.  Neat.  -  Songs learned recently:  A Wolf at the Door - Radiohead Good Riddance - Green Day Blister in the Sun - Violent Femmes  -  Wow, time flies when you're screwing around.
