Highlights included:  -After discussing all the advances gay right have made in the past few months, my Sex Teacher (sorry Community Health Professor) asked, "What happened recently in Canada?" some jackass yelled out "SARS!" It drew a laugh, but the sad thing is, I don't know if the kid was seriously answering the question.  -I'm taking a Post Modern 300 level English class (pomo) if you will and my Professor was a trucker.  I'm not talking delivering auto parts NAPA style, I'm talking coast to coast action.  Apparently, he stummbled onto the profession after becoming disenchanted with acadamia and subsequently came running back to teaching after less than a year on the road.  Dude is awesome.  He made a cd for the class containing all supplimental reading for the year and saved everyone about $30, while also being increadibly liberal with copyright laws. Double Bonus!!  After debating himself aloud for a few min. the Professor professed a desire to hold informal office hours at Murphy's ( a local bar) despite possible legal/ethical problems posed by holding meetings with students in a bar.  At the beginning of class, he told us we were free to bring any substances that would help keep us alert and then after seeing several sly smilles creep across our collective faces he tagged on the disclaimer, "That are legal."  An audible sigh of disapointment reverberated throughout the room.  Not like I do drugs or anything but I heard the chorus to "Feel Good Hit of The Summer" roll around in my head. C-c-c-c-c-cocaine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you want all the lyrics for "Feel Good Hit of the Summer" go here:  www.thefade.net/lyrics/feelgood The Professor ended the class saying he's more than willing to share trucker stories with us and enticed us with a little preview.  On one of his first days out training, the instructor for the Professor informed him that he sold illegal handguns out of his truck at truck stops.  Kind of makes you want to be a trucker don't it??  My last class on Thur. could have been dreadful, but turned out ok.  Reading about Restoration Period England isn't exactly high on my list of things to do, but graduating is, so I'm in the class.  At first I thought the Professor was going to be a total hipster cause he was rocking the glasses and black bowling shirt.  However, he's a very regular fellow, except for the fact he lived in San Francsisco and moved to these here cornfields. Newsflash buddy, it goes the other way around.
