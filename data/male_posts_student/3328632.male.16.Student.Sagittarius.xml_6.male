It is for those moments that we are alive, and it wouldn't be living without those moments.  Soymilk is good, it tastes better than regular milk, has a longer shelf-life, and doesn't have that disgusting fatty viscosity.  - Rip  out   "My words won't come out right. (What are you thinking?) I feel like im drowning."
