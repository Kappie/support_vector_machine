George Walker Bush. This man is the epitomy of the low-class-piece-of-shit president. Hes not educated, hes a fundamentalist christian (sorry mike, john), he is ugly, hes misinformed, and he....is a republican. On education, the public has already seen his blatant stupidity. "we need GOODER education for all the young peoples in this glorious land." hahaha...i always laugh when i hear that quote. Also, in every single one of his speeches, he appears to me to be a trained monkey, squeaking (and ?sqawking?) for more bananas. The stupid bitch...even his speech writers have to dumb up what they write so it sorta seems like he cares about the country (and that he wrote his own speech...which of course he didnt). As a declared fundamentalist baptist, George Bush really scares me. What "fundamentalist baptist" means is...he believes that every word in the bible is the complete truth. If fundamentalists would at least admit the fact that the bible has been poorly translated from Greek, Hebrew, and Arameac into Latin and then English, i might actually accept them into "my idea" of society. However, they dont. And therefore are not the kind of people that i wud take seriously...ever....unless of course they are burning people at the stake in the name of God...or...as in Mr. Bush's Case, MAKING HOLY WARS TO TAKE OVER THE PROMISED LAND! It all started with a great excuse to make war...the destruction of the world trade center. For all i know, bush is paying taliban to blow things up so he can take over the entire MIDDLE EAST. Whatever god is telling bush to blow people up and kill his own citizens does not deserve to be worshipped. GEORGE BUSH IS AN UGLY MAN....yes he is. Also, a president should not be misinformed, or taken the advantage of by his cabinet and other advisors. his assistants obviously have realized how dumb he is and are taking the advantage of him. (whisper: HEY LETS BLOW UP THIS COUNTRY (iraq) TO TEST ALL OF OUR NEW WEAPONS AND COMPLETELY IGNORE THE NUCLEAR THREAT TO OUR COUNTRY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD) Finally, Bush is a republican. This in and of itself should make half the country...well more than half...(gore won majority of votes) HATE HIS FRICKING GUTS. he wants to kill the trees....TREES MAKE OXYGEN WE NEED THEM DAMMIT...hes against gun control...WE NEED TO CONTROL GUNS U STUPID BITCHES...THEY KILL PEOPLE...and he is anti-abortion...HOW WUD U LIKE IT IF U GOT RAPED AND U HAD TO HAVE THE KID OF UR RAPIST?!?!?!?!?!   George should just lay down and die....  Here are some quotes from ur fellow students on the subject:  youknowwho417: i hate bush more than a cat hates a bathtub full of cold water.  DMcT846: george bush's thanksgiving escapade in Iraq was nothing more then another photo op!!! the bastard!  EVANGELI0N pilot: George Bush blows the penis off of your grandmother.  SockerAnGeL62: George bush can kiss my naturally white ass  youknowwho417: i hate bush more than a zombie squirrel hates rotten nuts.  Cat0607: i think he looks like a monkey...only w/ less hair   dropdedgorgous4: well hes so dumb he choked on a pretzel watching a football game  Hrogndzeln: "He should of died on that pretzel. Man, that would be the way for him to go. Someone assassinate him!"  wow...looks like no one likes him
