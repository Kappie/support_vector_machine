Unlike Caleb, I dun fit into any little group thingies. I'm just here and that's all that matters.   I think I'm a pretty kewl person...and stuff... apparently so does Mr. Thunderbolt 'cause he wouldn't have invited me to this place eef he din...hee hee..  Aaaand...yeah...aboot me...I like good music too! I promise! I tend to lean toward being a lovely metal head, but that's alright! And I recently found out (as in today) I'm a decent rapper type person, considering my background. Yay! Mehbe one of these days I'll post something I come up with....  Anywho, the best of luck to whomever reads this and doesn't have their head explode...you may be marred for life....   Caleb and Amanda accept no responsiblity in any mental or physical problems (i.e. severe headaches, unfound supernatural powers, or supreme head explody). If you have any problems, just call 1-800-whatever and speak to our highly trained professional monkeys who will fly and help you with any problems you may have! Thank you   -Manders
