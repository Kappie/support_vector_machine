The professor was discussing the potential ramifications of a regime where anyone could just ask his physician to help him die, and that would be legal.  This is perhaps a slight exaggeration of the picture the professor painted, but it's pretty close, I think:   ...so then you'd potentially have families trying to convince their elderly and sick parents and grandparents to die, to guilt them into it.  "Grandma, don't you remember, you promised Johnny you'd pay for his college education and now all your money's being spent to keep you alive;" "Grandma, it's not like you're going to get any better, so why not just go now;" "Grandma, it's a real hassle having to keep coming to visit you, it's disrupting our lives, it's just not very convenient for us;" "Grandma, don't you feel bad that you're using all of these medical resources that could be spent on someone younger, with a better end outcome, with more of a life to look forward to, don't you feel like you're being just a little bit selfish?"  And you're all laughing, but it might be closer to reality than you think.   We also talked about a case in Washington (I believe) where the Supreme Court struck down a law that would have allowed non-parents to petition a court for child visitation right against the will of the parent.  I assume the statute meant to apply to grandparents, and step-parents, and things like that... but I could definitely see that being the kind of statute Michael Jackson would support.  (You saw that one coming, didn't you?)  2. And, from another professor in class today: "I had a dream that I called on a student, and then he died."
