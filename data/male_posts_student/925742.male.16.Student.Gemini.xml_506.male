I think I've talked about Jake hear before....  anyway.  Sonja left on sunday, and so did her kung fu buddy and Ryan.  I only saw all of them together this weekend for a collective.. 15-20 minutes.  Awesome... Sonja's been a bitch.  Then I played the grip of Painkiller, which was awesome, what with the zombie ninjas and the zombie Nazi's and my arsenal of 100 rockets.  PEOPLE CAN FLY! And, coincidentally, be blown into small pieces.   I can play Painkiller online, even though I got it off of Deviance (hahaha)  Today was mellow.  Good.  I need less drama.  I guess it can be said that life is drama.  To say you're done with drama is to stop being alive.  Both metaphorically and physically.  I just want to be slightly sedated/have less drama.  Not a complete lack thereof, of course.  Buuh.  What? Yeah, ok.
