"what if things get screwed up?  what if we can't be friends?" they think.  true.  i wouldn't want to loose that friend.   here is the problem with girls:  they beat around the bush.  they play a game where they confuse the hell out of guys til we dont' know what they are thinking.  the whole time they're interested, of course.  but, we're not supposed to know.  then they get pissy or depressed when he doesn't say anything.  to any girls reading this:  be honest and forthcoming about your feelings with a guy.  he'll never get it otherwise....   maybe my only chance is to find someone outside of berlin.  or wait til college.  but, those don't sound like good options to me.  i'm looking for something now.  if there is someone out there reading this right now, see the previous paragraph and let me know.  who knows where things could lead to....
