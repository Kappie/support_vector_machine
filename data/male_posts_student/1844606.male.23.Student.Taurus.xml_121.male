Now they are sold out.  And I have no connections with the radio station.  Even if I did I doubt that I could score a pair.  So we've been corresponding through email on various ways to get in:  jimmy-  you said you had started working at the radio station again, right? well get on it and get us on the guestlist for the flaming lips show at the aragon. go! now!  reply:  Sadly, I am not employed by *****...Funny thing is, I don't miss it all that much. Being able to sleep in on the weekends has been rather refreshing. But we have two plans of attack: 1) I would bet q101 will be giving away more tickets soon and 2) We shall beging preperations for repelling from the el tracks. I shall send, via electronic mail, detailed schematics of the Aragon, uses of grappling hooks and portable mini-saws outfitted with compression devices so that Wayne and Jack shall not hear us sawing our ways backstage. Till further correspondence...
