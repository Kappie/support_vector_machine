I had a nice little fun time with that. I had 5 of my relatives over also this weekend. I always love that. Oh well, I guess, at least school's out and summer's going great. I couldn't catch the lunker today, I was disappointed in myself. I went fishing in a man made lake. Fun stuff. It was great. I haven't done anything worth while this summer yet. Looks like I need to head over to the dells or something. Well, good old softball tomorrow, hopefully it won't be as ugly as last week. I was about to off myself from last weeks debacle. I love the way our team bonds together to win. HAHAHA, wow. Hopefully we can score more than 4 runs tomorrow. I'll be happy to play at least. 1-4 is not a good record. Oh well, I guess, I'm out there to have fun. Too bad losing isn't very fun. I've kinda forgotten how good it feels to win. I'll update you on the situation tomorrow, hopefully no more migraines, that way I won't waste half my life sleeping away. I could use a woman right now, I'm very bored, and I know I won't be asleep until 3am. Cya later everybody, hopefully your summers not as depressing as mine has been. I think I'm going to go cruise grand for some ladies. Too bad none of them want me, it'll be a cold day in hell when I stop complaining about having no women. Wow, am I cool.
