Woah, for the first time in my life, i actually did something for my dad on father's day. How ironic isn't it...on father's day my dad gave me two items..a shaver and a battery charger..man..they amounted to about 100++ bucks...so well...didn't really feel entirely well about the entire situation...   Anyways, shall digress for a moment..thought using a shaver would be pretty easy..so kinda tried experimenting...well yeah...actually did pretty well..but after that the area just above the mouth didn't feel too comfortable...the area became crimson red as well. Argh..it's fine now..but i don't think i'm gonna try doing something like this in the near future..haha..so to all greenhorn shavers out there(whereever you shave =p)...do take extra caution and be careful...you don't wanna end up like dumb me here.  Something didn't exactly feel right..perhaps it was my conscience...if i do have one..so well i decided to extract part of my angbao money and treat dinner for the rest of the family that night..haha..dad felt pretty good about it..so did everyone else...and i was on the receiving end of appreciation..haha..it was pretty cool...though i spent quite a large sum of money...guess it was worth every penny...  Woke up yesterday morning to find out that spain lost, and so did greece. However, greece fortuitiously got in due to scoring more goals than spain. I don't think this is a really good rule..cuz spain scored less goals but also conceded less goals than greece...so oyeah...guess lady luck wasn't on spain's side. But the blame has to go to Spain, there was substandard marking and defending all throughout the game, they didn't show the drive and determination that got them thus far, and they were looking like they were playing with each other for the first time in their lives. They have one of the most impressive looking squads in the world, sometimes capable of scintillating displays of football, but guess they've under-achieved yet again.  Had to wake up real early cuz i was going to "Wild Wild Wet" with my dear nephews and niece who are returning to the states tomorrow. Got there at around 10, and the queue was already considerably long. But we still managed to get in after a short wait, guess the staff there were pretty effecient about doing their stuff, got in eventually and had to change and stuff. Geez. My younger nephew and niece are really cute...they keep trying to hold my hand and bring me somewhere..and cuz i was carrying my stuff on one hand...they had to fight for my other hand...lol. Eventually their mum, my cousin-in-law, who is pregnant once again, suggested that she hold my stuff while i hold their hands and look after them..lol.   Popped up in the main area, their mum said my cousin and I could go for the adult rides on our own first..so well..we did. We went to this gigantic v-shaped object where we saw people sliding down one side of the V at uber-high velocity, cuz the v shape, one one side was about 70 degrees from the ground. Got our float, which was meant for 2 persons, and well soon it was our turn...and woah..it was really really fun. It was an exhilarating experience, sliding down at such a high speed...something like a roller coaster...haha...so we went down the 70 degree side, and went up the other side of the V shape, and down again, and up for a couple of times. It wasn't exactly spine-chilling, but my butt hurt after the ride...cuz of abrasion with the ground...argh...  Went for a couple more rides and slides,but the first one was the most fun...haha...just that the repercussions weren't exactly much appreciated by most of the guests...haha..it was pretty evident...lol.  So came babysitting, i had to take care of the younger nephew, and he kept bugging me to go with him on the slides, which he eventually had the courage to do it on his own..haha..he's only 4 years old by the way..lol..and i had to carry him up so he could activate one of those water-shooting devices, and he didn't get tired of them until after donkey years...so well..my arm got so sore after that it started trembling in the later part of the day.   Now i know how my mum, and all mums felt when bringing up their children. I wouldn't say it's frustrating..though it can get quite exasperating at times...but it really is exhausting both physically and mentally. But well, being with them is a feeling that cannot be expressed..this is an area where language founders at sea.  Wasn't really that exhausted when i got home, so when to st. ignatius to play football with clement..found that my crossing is pretty good now..haha..oh well..it was really fun..just catching up and playing 1v1 and stuff..even though the father tried to chase us away..i quote him " You kenna my glass window u pay ah!" But well, guess it didn't pull off...lol..played 1 half hours of soccer...was really shagged after that...but still woke up this morning to watch england win croatia...damn...i really want the underdogs to prevail this time round..they almost did...the swiss and the croats...it was a gallant effort to fight for pride..couple of nice goals as well. Rooney impressed yet again...now it's become 9 goals in 10 international games for him. I have to say...that's a brilliant record. Hands down to him..but i guess he has to watch his attitude sometimes...  Sorry for yet another loooong and draggy entry..but well...feeling real crappy now..gonna go watch lp live at padang tonite..=)  Just to end off..this is something interesting i got From MountainWings..these excerpts are based on true experiences...and the stories are first hand accounts of experiences of what they would call "MountainWings moment"  "Sit down so that I can take off your shoes," I said.  He calmly sat down on the floor and held out his feet.  That's no big deal except for one small fact.  The person whom I was talking to was Christian, our 18-month-old son.  He can't talk, at least not legible enough for anyone to understand.  He can say Mama, Daddy, and Robbie (his babysitter) but that's the full extent of his comprehensible vocabulary. Everything else is just unintelligible grunts.  So what's so special about Christian sitting down and holding out his feet?  He understood what he himself can't put into words.  Kids understand what they may not be able to articulate.  They understand tones, emotions and whether something is said in love or frustration.  They can't spell bitterness... but they understand it. They can't spell anger... but they understand it. They can't spell hate... but they understand it. They can't spell resentment... but they understand it. They can't spell not being wanted... but they understand it.  Neither can they spell love...      but they understand it. They can't spell concern...         but they understand it. They can't spell patience...        but they understand it. They can't spell sacrifice...       but they understand it. They can't spell "I put you over my own needs..."                                     but they understand it.   You would be surprised what kids who can't articulate their feelings, reactions and thoughts, understand.  The adults around you often can't or won't articulate their feelings either.  And just like kids, you'd be surprised what they understand.
