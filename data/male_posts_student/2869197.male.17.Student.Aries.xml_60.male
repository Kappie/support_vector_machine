Well, actually just Emily, and just on one arm. I enjoy how our relationship is turning out. We kid and insult and retort lightly and in jest. Maybe this is why I gave up on my world, my piece and my peace...to join the real world, where Emily is.  Played more Ultimate Frisbee last night. We played on this mini-plateau of grass, really no more than a butte. I stubbed my barefoot on a manhole covering and now I have a bruise that hurts everytime I push it. Mental note:  Wear shoes during Ultimate Frisbee. We played a game of 7-weekers versus MNDI (3-weekers). The 7-weekers were obviously more skilled, but we pulled a zerg swarm over their mighty contingent, and horded the field with many a MNDIer. We won, but it wasn't pretty.  I found some more online quizes. Here are the results:   My japanese name is  山田 Yamada (mountain field) 聖人 Masato (sacred person) .  urlLink Take your real japanese name generator! today!
