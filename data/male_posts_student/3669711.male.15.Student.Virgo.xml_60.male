Thats 4.6 GB of downloaded material, and then when it is uncompressed it's 7.4 GB (for the actual install and play disc) and what it installs on your computer is also 7 GB.  Quite big if you ask me.  Not great for those of you with limited space.   Well, i also started playing it... but my computer doesn't seem to meet top system requirements, so if i turn the effects up too much, it really chugs on the CG scenes.  Not to good.  Also, i noticed that the cars in the first scene seem to "flip", and i dont' think thats supposed to happen.  Glitch?  I'm not sure.   I have actually just beat the Solid Snake sequence of the game... it was pretty fun, but the last part was kind of hard, with all of those guards around.  Lol, i remember that from the trailer... snake sneaks behind them, then he sneezes, and they become alerted to his presence.  You're supposed to be able to catch a cold in these games... but it hasn't happened to me.   I wonder what it takes to make snake catch a cold.   Well, i officialy don't like Raiden... he looks like such a panzy... i mean, look at Snake, the guy has muscles on his muscles.  Then this Raiden guy comes along... with long blonde hair, and he's such a whiner... and he calls the Colonel every five seconds.  There's another guy i don't like, he seems to have forgotten what Solid Snake has done for him in the past, and is now asociating him with the terrorist group "Sons of Liberty".  Thats just not cool.  Show some gratitude.  Lates
