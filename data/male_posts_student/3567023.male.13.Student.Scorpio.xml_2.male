Its all a bit hazy now but anyway I was riding down Harper when I was about halfway across the street I got hit by a car...I'm ok but...Ya I made a large scratch in their car...I think they're going to sue us...But ya I'm ok, I had been hit even a milisecond later I would be dead right now. Ya so feel free to call me and whatever if you want to talk. Oh ya and if you ever go anywhere on a bike WEAR A HELMAT mine save me from years of coma or certain death... HEAD MY WARINING THIS IS NOT JOKE!
