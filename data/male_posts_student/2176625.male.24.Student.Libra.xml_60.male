I shipped Cody  Ashlynn's wedding present to England, paid bills for the next month and took care of school bills. While I was in Sacramento, my family presented me with a check for my first semester. It's a gift from my parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles and friends of the family.   For the first time, Grandma Niya-Jina said she is proud of me.
