I don't really care about the wildfires in Kahlefornia, and the background noise in Iraq isn't really worth commenting on, since the Left's wailing is nothing new.  The Matrix: Revolutions opens next Wednesday.  After Reloaded, the Matrix series is poised to be one of the greatest genre films, but it could still go poorly if Revolutions returns to a tired Hollywood predictability.  While I anticipate it, I fear what it might become.  Lord of the Rings: Return of the King will be out in a month or so.  Unfortunately, I could care less about this one after having the ending revealed to me.  It really is a pity that Tolkein was such a wuss.  I could go on a long rant, but who would really want to read it?  You know, on the entertainment front, there isn't really a lot for me to look forward to.  Anyone want to start a movie debate?  What is coming that you want to see?  What have you seen recently that you have liked?  Why is Harry Knowles from Aintitcool.com a complete mouthbreathing moron?  Is George Luca$$ the anti-Christ?
