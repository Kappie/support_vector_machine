The eye loves the countenances of fields and mountains, the coloured shell of stone, the fluent mirror of the ocean, the speckled canopy of night and the human face which veils a life. Perhaps the eye loves to linger on the mystery of the surface in order to imagine what lies beneath and beyond.   The great happenings of our lives arise from this unseen world. Unexpected, they surprise us with urgent visitation. Yet all the while, without our knowing, change is secretly at work beneath. True change is never abrupt or forced or temporary, it arises naturally from a long, secret gestation behind the outer visage. Even in the most fixated situations, in the most paralyzed mentalities and in the most repetitive postures, the pulse of change is quietly at work.   Winter is a grey season of cold and wet. Fields lie bleak and stuck, all colour bleached from them. Trees have become gaunt black skeletons. On its first sighting of Winter, how could the human eye ever imagine the change that is about to break forth? First through myriad arrivals, buds and shoots begin to thrust forth into the air and soon the unimaginable symphony of leaf, flower and colour delight us. The deepest secret of Winter is its verdant treasure of buried Spring. As light deepens and days lengthen, sacred Spring arises to transfigure dead landscapes with beauty.   There is an unseen life that dreams us; it knows our true direction and destiny. We can trust ourselves more than we realize and we need have no fear of change. We can risk everything for growth and we will never be disappointed. We have no need to remain prisoners of the surface. Within each clay heart is the Spring that never dies - the soul.
