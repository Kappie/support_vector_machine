(cud u sense the sarcasm?) i just dun understand a single bloody thing bout Islam. and hell, there are 5 chapters on it. omg...wtv man  as for bio, the Mr i-am-too-good-to-be-true, said that "we'll see who will have the last laugh since u guys were not paying attention to the presentation" haha. im laughing now. haha. just did it again. and for all u know, even if i did it badly (choi!) i will still laugh. haha.   i have enuff of physics. although miss sumi is really good at teaching...its just me who is really bad at learning. enuff of all the stupid archimedes' principle, bernoulli's principle and all those sh!t. its just so difficult to understand. so wut if f=kx ? i just dislike the subject...  chem...i guess its really interesting. just that u have to memorize a lot of stuff. like this + oxygen u get this. and then u have to balance the equation. however, i kinda like the subject...(though the teacher is a little boring..)  ooh, twins new movie, The Twins Effect 2 starring twins (duh), jaycee (jackie chan's son-really looks like his father and is rumoured with gillian chung [eww!]), jackie chan, donnie yen (i think this is how u spell his name), daniel wu (the baddy in the movie), and guest starring edison chen (haha! he isnt the main character this time! though i prefer him more than jaycee) will be showing in august. i cant wait for it! and rumours have it that they might be promoting the movie in singapore...so hehe..i can ask my sis to go and maybe get their signature and poster! :D  alrite ppl..i'll stop here...ciaoz and wish me luck in the test...  (._.)v peace!!
