I was born in 1988, my parents where way to young when they had me; my dad was 18 and my mother was 17. Now because of that, it shows that they had sex before they got married. Alright, no biggy right? Wrong.   My dad has been married 4 times already. All of them have ended badly costing him thousands and lots of time of his life. You know what they all have in common? He had sex before he got married, and he got married within at most 2 weeks of meeting the person. Now when I say meet, I mean in person. Yet he has meet a couple ahead of time through friends and things, but they don't really count because the person can lie and you wouldn't know it. Anyway, he had sex before he got married and that got me to thinking.   Think about how many people on average get a divorce within 2 years, like me dad in pretty much all of his marriages. Now think about how many of them had sex before marriage. Do you see where I am going with this? Sex is not, I repeat, not a way of showing you love a person. It is only a way to pleasure you and your "mate". Yet many do not understand that and many don't even think about it. If you want to show true affection for one another, then don't have sex until your married. True love does not need sex! If your "mate" keeps trying to get it out of you, then there just may be no love there in the future. Why do I say this? Well I have lived 16 mothers without a real mother, and because of that I have time to reflect on my dads mistakes and the wife he is breaking up with to see what to avoid.   As far as I can tell, sex is the one thing that gets in the way of the love. I am sure many of you understand what I am getting at and some of you may not even care what I am saying. But I shall give you fair warning right now. Do not have sex until you are married! If you don't wish to do that then at least hold off for 3 to 6 months. Trust me, if this person really loves you and I mean truly, deeply loves you, then that person can wait a long time to have sex. Sex is not a big need in a successful relationship, it never was.   Anyway, I thought I would just come on out and talk to you about that. I just felt like doing so for it is who I am and I feel open to say it here. LOL! Anyway, I got to crash. Later!
