Who is she to decide what all of our small county wants.  That's why its the school board and not the AP English 11 teacher board (which would consist of only her)  When I asked her about it I found that she wasn't going to tell us and we would all find out after school was over (probably because we're the most active class politically [3 of us going to girls/boys state]) At lunch I rounded up some of my fellow class members and marched in the Assistant principle office that's in charge of English and told him what's going on.  Sadly I was elected speaker of the group.  After speaking with him he wrote down our comments and the facts and told us he would take care of it.  Later that day I found out that our principle will e-mail the AP Teachers reminding them that they have no choice in the matter and they *must* give everyone who passes our state profiency test must be given a 100 A on the exam, no just exemptions but an A (hey...Its 20% of our semester grade).  My English teacher would be furious, its a good thing I asked that we all remain anonymous.  And luckily, she doesn't have the address for this blog.  Finally I don't have to worry about my exam grade anymore.
