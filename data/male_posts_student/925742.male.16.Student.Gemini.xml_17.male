So I grudgingly did... but the grudge was absolved once I ate some bannana/apple waffles with honey.  So to get to the point, I've had bad upper back pain for the last three days ( I think I was stretching and I sneezed while standing up and my muscles got all discombobulated). When I got to work I realized that my task of the day was to lift heavy boxes. But they were of drugs so I was like, "Hey, its not *all* bad, right?"  Once they were moved out of the unit, I was to sweep it out, clean its walls, and then put them all back in according to the name of the drug. It took me the whole day... well, not the WHOLE day, the end I spent looking for garbage to throw away.  But all that lifting really hurt my back. Ow. I get to go to the Ultimate Fights tonight, so I guess its looking up.
