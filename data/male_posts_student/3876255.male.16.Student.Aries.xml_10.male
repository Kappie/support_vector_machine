The only meaning of "trip" that is in my mind right now is, "Leisure time away from work or school; devoted to rest or pleasure."  That's right, it's trip time.  Baby.  Yeah.  My family and I are going to Washington, D.C. tomorrow.  That means I get to ride in the back of the family van all by myself and enjoy my music and enjoy my magazines and enjoy my breath mints whilst I enjoy staring out the window into nothingness.  I like time to myself, because I'm insane.  I'm going to get caught up with all of the reading I should have been doing the past two years.  I have somewhere in the area of five billion magazines that I need to read, and I'm a member of an ever-so wonderful science fiction book club, from which I have obtained many books that I have yet to read.  Reading doesn't seem like such a huge part of my life now like it once used to be.  Of course, I now have more important things to do, like talk to you and pick my nose with tire irons.  Stoop-o-rific, spin-doodalee-astic.  Trip time.  I'm gonna trip.  Dude.  And then, the next stop will be the place that we all love.  You probably have a tee shirt in your closet proclaiming your love for the location.  Yep, we are going to New York.  I've never been there, and I am looking forward to it, but I don't think the van will enjoy getting hit so many times by the cabbies.  I heard from someone once that they aren't too careful about stuff like that.  Does anyone here have any knowledge as to whether or not this is a fact?  Will I get killed by a cab driver in New York?  What if I'm allergic to apples?  Right now, my eardrums are vibrating their hairs off with the sounds of Aphrodite's Drum and Bass remix of "The Luniz - I Got Five On It."  I seem to have recently acquired a taste for the D style.  I just like to imagine that I'm doing the remixing in the auditorium at my school and all of the students are there cheering me on and drinking soda-pop, because when I do remixes, I sell soda-pop, and that's just what I do.  And then, when I do a really cool drum solo, I get bombarded with artifacts from the crowd.  Artifacts = bras and panties.
