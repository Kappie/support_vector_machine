I don’t think it was he. I have decided to name this mystery man Stephen  Meet because it doesn't sound like Danny fish, but it’s strangely similar. Maybe  its bizzaro Danny in that case, I better not let them meet otherwise they'll  cancel each other out causing a hole in the space time continuum and causing Kent  to move to another parrel world, which would be bad, since the new Kent is  probably going to be worse than the old one.  I will post if there is any more Stephen Meet sightings.
