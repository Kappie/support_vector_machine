After how many months I've been waiting, the nice weather is finally here. It better stay like this. So next week is gonna be pretty bad. Lotta work. Lotta crap. Eh same thing. I really can't wait until summer. I have to say though, this year wasn't too tough. Actually went pretty quickly in my opinion. I'm also glad to see that finally after all the practicing I do, I'm slowly becoming a semi-respectable guitarist. Until I master the No Boundaries solo by Michael Angelo, I will not be content with my skill. ....Which means I will never be content with my skill because that solo is just plain impossible. I bow down to that man. He is inhuman. Download it and see what I mean. Michael Angelo - Speed Kills.  Listen to H.I.M.
