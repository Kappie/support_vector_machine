First off you must know that when i see wee man skate on jack ass i get extremely excited, probably more happy than anything else gets me in the whole wide world.  Ok so for my dream to come true i first have to become filthy rich. Once rich I build a gigantic Midget Sized Skatepark in my basement. Then i buy myself a midget and tell him to learn how to skateboard or he starves. I'll most likely go through like 7 midgets but w/e who cares about them anyways??? Then once one gets good everyweek ill stop in on monday night and watch him skate for half an hour or so, Ill rate him on a scale of 1 to 10, and then depending on his score will be how much food he gets that week. If he gets a ten ill prob let him out of the house on his leash for a bit too.   This is my life dream....
