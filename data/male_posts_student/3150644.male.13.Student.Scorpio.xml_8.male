Though making us laugh a few times, he did not crack so much jokes this time - you could tell he wanted to get a job done quickly.  This is the first time we practiced with rain - and the first time we practiced that we did not sweat at all.  After the thing some sec2s went to play basketball. I did not get much chances to shoot =( but it was fun anyway. I got quite a few wounds from that game. it was rough, ya, but then my most serious wound came from when I fell and tripped on the tiles while going to get the ball. Abrasion.  Well that was all for that nice afternoon...
