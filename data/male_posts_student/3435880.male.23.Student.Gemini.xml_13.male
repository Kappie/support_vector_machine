I've been listening to Kyuss... yeah.. i know you people probably don't know it... but here's a name I'm sure you know..... Queens of the Stone Age. You know them don't you. Yeah. Some of the guys from QOTSA were members of Kyuss. It's basicly stoner/groove metal. Really mellow stuff that has a good drive to it. Really good listen. I would recomend "Size Queen", "One Inch Man", "Gardenia" and "Space Cadet" for starters. It's some really good sheeit.  Some other bands that I've re-aquainted with is Crowbar. They're slow metal too, but no too melow. It's got a really dark feel to it despite some of the catchier riffs they have. One thing I love it the breakdowns they do. I mean you have a song doing like 60 beats per minute (that's 1 per second for those that have trouble with math) and then the breakdown comes and it drops to half-time. And during these breakdowns, they have some of the most amazing and crushing riffs. Really gets into ya...you can really feel it. Hard to explain. Anyhow. Have a good one. It's bed time for me now...  FnR
