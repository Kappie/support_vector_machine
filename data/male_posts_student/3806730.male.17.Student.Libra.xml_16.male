I am sooooo looking forward to Friday.. better days and better weeks and better times are ahead.  So I better look to that.  Listening to Jars of Clay and Josh Groban last night, they kinda lifted my spirits..     I'm here waiting for something new to break my heart So callous laden, I can't feel a thing at all Will You catch my fall?  From lost and not found, to run and not hide My hand inside... (Your hand)  Fear is keeping time with the beating of my heart Doin' way too much thinkin' And it's tearing me apart But I, I feel You reach for me  From lost and not found, to run and not hide My hand inside... (Your hand) Losing my grip falling so far My hand inside Your hand  I hear Your voice and follow So hard to believe, and still I go.                    Jars of Clay
