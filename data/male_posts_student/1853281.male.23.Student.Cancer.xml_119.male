There seemed to be very little actually having to do with being gay or gaining rights, or honoring the history of the community. It was all corporate greed, political manouvering and cruising. Needless to say, i was not amused. Ah well. What can one do? Birthday coming up...grrr...time is flying by.  Party on the third at two o'clock at my place, Grilling out. Bring what you want to drink/grill. I might be going to a show that night, so party won't be an all day/all night thing:) PS. I am finally losing weight again
