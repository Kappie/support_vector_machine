Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Tipsy -J-Kwon Peak  Billboard Hot 100  position: #2 Had  Nelly ,  Chingy , and  Ludacris  not popularized the overdone Southern drawl, this single would not have been a hit. But, as we all know, they did. So, producers  Trackboyz  were able to put a minimalist club-stomp beat and some digital bass-funk underneath one of the world’s lesser emcees, the straight outta high-school J-Kwon. Sounding more like a shyer Fabolous than a promising Southern rapper, Kwon uses a straight and simple delivery to lisp his way through a late-night club experience. Actually, in one of the odder occurrences of the year, Kwon’s seemingly useless spit over a simplistically catchy beat evokes the original pioneers of that art: the Beastie Boys.   Best Moment:  The chorus, after being muddled by J-Kwon’s accent, is translated roughly to this: “Air-buddy in thu cluu get’n tips.” (Note: The unedited version of the song ruins the chorus by awkwardly replacing “the club” with “this bitch.”)    The Verdict:  6.2/10 - The Fork   (3.1/5)
