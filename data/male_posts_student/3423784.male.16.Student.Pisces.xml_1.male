This is what he told our reporters at the grim blog hate page: 'I really liked Julians layout, but i decided that I cant have the same as his, i'm meant to show that his is bad and mine is good, but then again... his is much better.'   The grim blog hate page brings you the latest news on thegrimblog once more.  Julian
