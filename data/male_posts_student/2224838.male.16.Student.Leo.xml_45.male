For the movies that were already scheduled to play I simply clicked on the "remind me" button so TCM will e-mail me one week before, as well as one day before the movie airs. This way, I should never forget to catch a movie I want to see again. While I was there I also signed up to  urlLink become a member of TCM . Now I will receive e-mail newsletters and monthly TCM schedules. I should have done this much sooner.
