Such a perfect universe, such a perfect place...  Science in itself has been created so perfectly that there is no flaw, and everything that it bases is on a question, which is at the origin. So what is the answer? The answer is the the almighty being that created the entire universe by just saying a few words. God - Infinitly powerful, boundlessly loving....   What creatures are we that out of the zillion of things He created, He should love us so much that just to be with us, He sent his one and only Son to die and take our dued eternal punishment and curses, so that we can spend an eternity with him...   People worship nature, people worship dead objects, but... why? For what purpose? Why dont they look up to the real person who created all these things in such a perfect balance and wide spectrum that is entirely beyond our comprehension itself?  So beautiful is the world... God's gift for us, and like a child who is bored with a toy, starts to destroy and dismantle it... But God did not stop us... because He, like a father, wants to seehis sonhappy.... and even when we hurt ourselves by doing so, He is there, right beside us, giving His shoulder for us to cry on... Using his love and sweet words and wiping away our tears....   Will any god do that? People seek knowledge and philosophies to find out their meaning in life, and they end up worshipping role-models they think did the right thing, making them a diety. They worship the belifs and values they hold, thinking they will be able to become like them... but what for?  Our God is a God of love, and holiness... and that just summerizes about everything that goodness is made of... Love is everything that God has done for us, and holiness is everything that causes us to be unable to reach Him without being holy ourselves... Thats why He gave us Jesus, HisSon, the ultimate sacrifice, sothat we may all be able tosee God face to face, tohug him and talk to him personally...   Tell me an innocent person that you know, that from young, healthy and strong, already knew and had a destiny in mind - to die a terrible death and be a living sacrifice?  I love Jesus, because He first loved me... He took the fall, the piercing, the torture, and in His eyes He knew that he was doing this for me, and He willingly did so... That is His love for us, so great that He eventually died the most terrible death at that time, to be hung up on the cross, bleeding and suffocating, He took the sins of the entire world and the future generations upon himself, and His Father, God, for a moment lost Him...Dying, He gazed down from the cross, before His last breath, He reached out and cleansed all the present and future belivers from sin, and died.... and all our sins died along with Him...  And as long as we belive, and trust in Him, we will be able to be with Him forever and ever, in a place more perfect then you can ever imagine...   I love Him, will you love Him too?   I pray that if you read this blog, will come to know that there is somebody who loves you so much, that He would leave behind everything just to be able to hug you and comfort you, to wipe away your tears and make you happy... and that He only want one thing from you.. and that is that you would love Him back...
