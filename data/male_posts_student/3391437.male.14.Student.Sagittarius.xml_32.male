I am obligated to choose just one between a rack and a computer table. As I can see both the rack and the computer table have played a major role in my life. The computer table has given me a place to put the computer on. The rack also has given me a place to put magazines and books. I would enjoy having both of the furniture in this room. I am not going to make the decision about what furniture moves out of the room. There are other three people who share this same room with me that is why I canâ€™t make this decision. A decision should be made which is fair to everyone in the group. But, if I were to choose just one I would choose the computer.
