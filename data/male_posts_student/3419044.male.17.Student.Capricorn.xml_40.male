Where else do they advertise 'Two For One Paris Hilton Explicit Sex Tape Videos' on 200 square foot billboards beside the Highway?

We will be taking the Waverunner! :D Oh yeah, and that Chris kid. ;) Tyler will be there as well. It will be a great time dumping eachother off the Waverunner in the Flathead Lake! Sorry audience, I will try to find a computer at the Meadow Lake resort to make a post. See you in a few days!
