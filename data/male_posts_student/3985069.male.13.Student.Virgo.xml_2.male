I love my family alot and I hang out with them all the time! I absoluteley love computer games and ALL video games though I am trying to get off of them and go out side more often. I have about five people who like me and I do not like anyone right now. So I guess you could say that I have a good personality and all that stuff. I am doing ok in school and going into the 9th grade. I have three sisters and one brother! I know its a ton!!!! I just moved into a new house about a month ago and it is HUGE compared to the tiny trailer we used to live in. Stuffing 7 people into a trailer isn't too fun! I used to play all sports except foot ball and tennis. (all those other wierd sports too) I am looking forward to the new school year so that I can hang out with friends again and maybe play some more sports! I am in choir and band (hopefully quitting band soon!) and in most of the school plays. I was the main part (Jesus) in Godspell last year and hoping to be a main part in one of the plays in high school.
