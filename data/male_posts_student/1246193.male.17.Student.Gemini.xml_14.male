I don't understand what my purpose is.  I have no goals for the distant future.   I want to be happy.  I am happy, most of the time.    Too much pressure,  I don't understand.    I should embrace the future.  I don't.  I fear the future. What is to come?  What will happen when people stop making decisions for me?  I will make the wrong decisions, but I don't want to.  I don't want to be a nobody.  I want to be somebody, who doesn't stand out. So many questions.  So many worries. So many fears.  I don't understand why I am here. I want to contribute.  I haven't so far.  I want to feel needed.  Without feeling need. Does everyone understand?  I am the only one?
