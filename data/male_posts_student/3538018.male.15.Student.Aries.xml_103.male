Im sure it wont though...i as well as her will make it through this next month and all will be well =)  Thats the way i see it anyway.....  so today didnt start for me until 130 today because thats when i woke up.  My mom was really angry about that and i sure heard about it too...eh whatever, i will just have to get up earlier from now on.  Harry Potter was defenitly not what i expected it to be...they sure left a lot out and mixed stuff up a lot.  It was a good movie if you have never read the books but seeing that i have read them, the movie kinda destroyed my image of the third book =/  so i got my report card yesterday and my parents were actually pleased with my report card which definetly took a load off my back...it had been on my mind since school got out whether or not they would like my report card and now it is off and i can enjoy without worry the rest of my summer and not think anything about the place that i have come to call hell.    Tommorow is gonna be a fun day not....gotta mow the lawn and im gonna get over to the gym in the morning...errr then the afternoon looks relaxing and in the evening there are many choices to what i could do...so i guess what i mean is that tommorow morning does not look like a fun day...so yeah, im out....  "...and its you ill miss most of all my darling.  When the sun sets in the west Ill be thinking of you...I hope you do too."
