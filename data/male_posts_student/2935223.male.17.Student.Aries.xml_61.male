I'm sorry guys.  Boy, I sure get depressed easily...  It was a long and touching story...but in the end, it didn't have a happy ending like in the movies.  It ended up with a sad squirrel.  More knowledgeable, but sad.  I don't want to be like that....and I don't want to make people sad anymore...  I'll get over it, I promise.  Spense
