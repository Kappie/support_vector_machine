Then wrote an essay about communism (Actually, against communism, I advocate capitalism ;) ) I won a consolation prize in an Essay Writing Competition organised by the Oxford  Cambridge Society of Malaysia. That would put me in the 6th position out of a lot of students and I am more than just consoled! I was shocked but happy. ;) I was seriously not expecting to win anything. It was a boring day aside from that...
