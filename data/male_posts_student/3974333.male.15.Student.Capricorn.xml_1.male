Throwing apples and all sorts around the bus. One apple had hita girland suprisingly the kid just sat down and acted like nothing had happened.This girlwasn't wanting to go up and get up these little crackheads so I decided I'd take it upon myself to make sure they apologised. Funny it seems when a person bigger then them approaches em, they're quick to kiss arse and make up.    This really opened my eyes to how two-faced some people can be. The fact that people just plain don't give a fuck about anyone else these days really annoys me. For example; I'll hold a door open for a person, and they expect it. No thankyou's or cheers mate, they just expect it. The lack of consideration really gets me up in arms and people wonder why others get pissed because of it. I think Australia needs to take a look themselves and realise how fucking arrogant and rude they can be, because for the rest of us, you make this world a less enjoyable place.
