Air Force Auxilary) meeting down at Miramar in the Air National Guard complex, I was watching some CAP Cadets (I am going to soon be one) doing their normal drilling and walking and marching in step and formation. A senior member came up to my friend (and tourguide for the past few weeks)and I and we began talking. A Marine FA-18 Hornet flew over us, which was common since we were situated next to the Marine Corps Air Station at Miramar. The man looked up and asked, "Do your here that noise?" My friend and I both nodded and then the man shook his head and said, "That isn't noise." We were confused, and then he added, pointing to the jet, "That's the Sound of Freedom."
