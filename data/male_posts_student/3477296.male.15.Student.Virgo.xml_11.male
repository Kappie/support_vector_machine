So yeah, if you could post it up if you're a member, or leave it in the comments section that would be great. (Something serious on this blog for once... haha). Well anyway, at the moment I'm hoping to do:                    3 English                       2 Economics                   3 Maths                         2 Legal Studies                   2 Ancient History  Hmm... that's providing that I get a better rank for Maths in second semester. Now that doesn't sound too promising does it?
