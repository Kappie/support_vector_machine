And the verdict is....after a year (or two) break, Avril still rocks !! wow ! her album is amazing ! i liked all of the songs inside it (except one "he wasn't" which didnt really make sense) wow...one talented chick here ! punk rock seems to be getting better and better huh ? However, compared to her first album, there is more "other" sounds other than she singing, and sometimes her voice is covered by all the "other" sounds,making it sound like she's scream-singing(or is she?)...but overall i still think that if you guys are thinking of getting something new, Avril's album is not a bad choice.Being in the industry for quite some time now, she seems to have matured in her thinking and thus portrays it in her lyrics. there's even the last song, called "slipped away", it was dedicated to her grandpa who passed away i think. the lyrics is really meaningful, and tell you she's not just another punk freak gurl devoid of loving people i guess. I guess why Avril's song really turns me on ( not that way !)is because she is really truthful with the lyrics she writes and that you are able to relate her song to a part of your life, be it when you are madly infactuated or have a love-at-first-sight thingy, or feeling betrayed by your other half,and i guess that's cool. oh yeah,one last thing. I didn't regret buying it.
