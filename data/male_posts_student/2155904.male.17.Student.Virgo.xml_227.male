But Tyke left Edinburgh a few days ago and the train sucked.  They got stopped a lot because of "problems" so they were on the same train for 7 days.  But even when the train got in they still had to get to Dover which is Southern England and they were in London which is not Southern.  That was a bit of a journey in itself.  They finally got in much much later and the room they were in was quite small.  But they got through it.  Running out of time.  The next day they went to France by ferry and that was another strange trip.  The next day they saw a bunch of the beaches from WWII and took pics and videos.  But then they had to drive to Paris and that really took a lot of work.  The streets here in France are not well marked so it was very difficult to get to the hotel.  It took 7 and a half hours when it should have taken about 4.  But they did get in and their hotel is fine.  Tyke also can see the Eiffel Tower from his room if he leans out a bit but his fear of heights doesn't so much like that.  But today he will get to see the tower and the Louvre and other things like that.  It's now Friday here so Tyke is almost home and he is definitely ready to be back home.  But now Tyke is out of time so bonsoir!
