When I walked in there in the morning to drop off my stuff, it reminded me so much of that scene in 'My familly' when Ben walks downstairs in the morning to find his house filled with Xmas trees...y'know the one. Heehee.  Bishop made himself look like an idiot (no suprises there) and I got to do door duty. Where I basically act as a bouncer. *rolls on the floor laughing*  Oh, and check this out:     I sooooo badly want to buy that...and do fun runs 'n' things in it. In fact...I wonder how much money I could raise by doing Bristol's Biggest Bike ride wearing that...(next year, obviously)  Oh, and England play Croatia today...we need either a draw or a win to get through. But because of last nights results (Russia 2 - Greece 1, Spain 0 - Portugal 1) Portugal and Greece go through...and we'd have to play Portugal unless Switzerland beat France, and we beat Croatia. Erk. COME ON SWITZERLAND...AND COME ON ENGLAND!
