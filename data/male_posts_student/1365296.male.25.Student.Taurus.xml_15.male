It seems like it was just yesterday yet at the same time so long ago that the primary campaign was rumbling along. It will have been a year come mid-August that I began really tuning in to the election, with my first enthusiastic reactions pointed squarely at Dean. That marked the beginning ofthe election adventure I immerse myself into every four years. This election adventure actually happens every two years, but its the presidential elections that really get me high. Its so lively, and its a national excitement. I love it. I've loved it ever since 1988 when I first discovered the fun that are elections. Starting in 1992 I've been hooked. The most fun I can think of is sitting with friends watching the election results come in. Now its 2004 and the second presidential election I will participate in, and my excitement is beyond explanation.   the 2004 election began for mein the summer of 2003. It was mid-August and I watched one of the debates. I was immediately struck by Howard Dean and his seemingly straight talk manner. I was actuallypretty enthusiastic about him. But after a day or two of thinking about him, my enthusiasm subsided. Dean seemed very attractive, especially to younger voters like myself, but something seemed off. I immediately began to question him and his rise to the top, and quickly became convinced that he was not what he seemed. Something was off, and I knew his rise was premature and headed for a crash. Then there was the cult that surrounded Dean. I've never been one to worshipa man, and I wasn't going to start. It was too much, and I knew it wouldn't last.   In my research of the others (those who had a chance, mind you) I came across a most unlikely contender that wasn't: General Wesley Clark. I've liked the man ever since 1998 and Kosovo Campaign. He's about the smartest man alive, and I immediately took a liking to the man. He was up front, smart, and I knew right then that he was my candidate. I signed the "Draft Clark" petition and expressed my full support for him. I'm proud to say I was a part of the draft movement, and the joy I felt when he finally announced was simply grand.   I donated $120 to his campaign. That's how strongly I felt about General Clark. I believed then, and still believe, that he would have been the best candidate to run against President Bush. But it wasn't to be. He came in immediately not as the anti-Dean, but as the alternative to Dean. People like myself who were wary of Dean looked at the General and liked what they saw. Many supported the General. And many more declared the General their second choice. General Clark rose to the top and began to give Dean a nice scare. The closer New Hampshire got, the more and more it looked like the General might pull an upset. And that is exactly what would have happened.   Then Kerry came out of nowhere, along with Edwards, and stole the show in Iowa. Clark had chosen not to campaign there, believing it was too late for him toachieve any sort of formidable presence there. He was wrong. He has even admitted that he was wrong. Edwards and Kerry proved that Clark could have done great things there had he only diverted some of his money into establishing a campaign in the state. Instead Kerry rose to the top, winning back supporters that had bolted him earlier for Clark and other candidates when Kerry's campaign appeared to be near collapse. Kerry also recovered much of the veteran vote that Clark had recently held. Walking into New Hampshire Kerry saw a significant bounce that pushed Clark into a third place tie with Edwards, who himself came out of nowhere in Iowa after spending very little time and money in the state. Come New Hampshire, Clark would come in third, but it was a weak third that he barely won from Edwards. I had told those on the General'sblog that he would have to finish second in New Hampshire; third or less and we would lose the nomination. They didn't believe me, but I turned out to be correct. It was crushing. I stayed loyal, but I could see the proverbial writing on the wall. Clark had lost that night.   Now its late-July and I'm getting ready to watch the Democratic National Convention. Its an exciting time, if bittersweet. I sit here contemplating the what-ifs and what-might-have-beens. After moving over into the Bush camp in late-April, I've moved back into the undecided category where I started nearly a year ago. I have soured on President Bush and his social conservatism (the only conservatism the man holds). Kerry is no better at this point, following the advice of one of his favorite sports, para-surfing, and going in whichever direction the wind takes him. I don't believe he would be any better than Bush, but he certainly couldn't be any worse.   So now I've relegated myself to a simple observer, reveling in the excitement of the election. I have my Clark paraphernalia readily visible, and I'm feeling the excitement of so long ago. Now the real fun begins.
