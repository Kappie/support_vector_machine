I do believe the internation community would've liked Ted's speech because it bashed Bush's handling of foreign policy and his alienation of long-time allies, allies which helped to win 2 World Wars. If you can get ahold of his speech online, you should check it out. I'm also told Barack Obama's speech was good, though I didn't see it. He's a Chicago boy, and he's family friends with a good friend of mine. So, in case you couldn't tell, I'm a Democrat. I'm still working on some way to sneak all of you into the country to vote, along with Luis de Sebastian, the Latin American Economies teacher. He was a big Dean supporter, but Dean is an over-emotional lunatic. I know that Ulli wanted candidate info at one point, so if you're still interested, try to find the speeches from the Democratic National Convention online, Ulli. Sidenote, did anyone know that Famke Janssen of X-Men fame is Dutch? She speaks better English than I do. She was on the Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn tonight, and I watched simply because she's hot. Sadly, Craig does not live up to the Late Late Show's illustrious international history. He's a horrible interviewer who babbles and makes piss-poor jokes. If you don't know who he is, keep it that way. Well, off to bed now. Hopefully we'll oust Bush in '04 and the world will like us again. It really does suck to travel when you see "I hate America" and "America sucks" t-shirts (as I saw in BCN), and when people hate you as soon as they hear your American accent. Oh, to be Icelandic, where they piss on the main plaza.    Tim
