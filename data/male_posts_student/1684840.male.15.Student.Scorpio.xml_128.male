I woke up at 1:23, and for some reason, I'm always looking at the clock when a consecutive time is displayed... and me being the most easily interested person in the world, finds that interesting! lol.  Anyways, back on track...  Mum cooked a really kool brunch with mushrooms and bacon and sausage and really tasty baked beans + cheese on toast!  YUMM!!  Thanks mum :D!  Afterwards I decided I was going to go to town, with or without friends.  I'm totally different from everyone else, so i decided to ring and ask people whether they wanted to go town with me :o)  First I asked Michaela, but she was with Sam.  I rang James but he was out, so I gave Chris a try... and bingo!  I called for him and got a lift into town from his mum and dad (thanks!) and we trekked through the quiet streets, inhabited by the few Sunday shoppers (yeah, there were probably like 50 people in the whole of town) and to Woolworths.  Due to the quietness of the streets, Chris' voice was 10x louder than ever, so like everyone heard what he was saying :P lol!  I'm sorry but if I was going to pick a totally shit place to buy music CDs from, it would be Woolworths!  Chris bought some M 'n' Ms and we walked through town talking about... anything really.  We talked about the fireplace shop which caught fire, trying to decide whether it was worthy of the title "ironic", or not.  In the end, we thought it was.  I compared it to getting run over by an ambulance, which would be totally ironic.  I also wondered: "What if yo' mamma sat on a rainbow and M 'n' Ms popped out instead of Skittles?", to which Chris gave the ultimate answer, "A massive law suit would be launched." (Don't tell me you have never heard that Yo' Mama joke!)  I bought the new Blink 182 album (well when I say new, I mean the new-er one) from WHSmith, who have a great selection of music compard to the store obsessed with sheep (Woolworths is totally baaaaring sometimes!)  I've had a haircutand my face is itching again :(  A whole line of spots has formed on the right side of my face and I'm starting to look like a dot-to-dot game again;  It's punishment for eating too much chocolate!  I'm gonna go now, and have a lazy evening on this fine Sunday.  There's a nice big bottle of champagne in the fridge, dreading the day of our approval because it's going to be popped with a lot of force!  Hopefully... and I hope to GOD, that we are approved this week!  C'mon Texas Service Center!  (yes that's centre with the last two letters flipped).  Bye everyone, including you lot *points at all the teachers reading my blog*   :o)
