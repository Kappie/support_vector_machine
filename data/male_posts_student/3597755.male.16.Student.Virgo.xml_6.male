I don't need to tell you things have changed. I'll do it anyway...  America, the land of hope and freedom? Not anymore. Hope? No way, many Americans are dirt poor. The governament doesn't provide chances. They live, they suffer and they die poor. Freedom? No way. Everybody can sue everybody for nothing, win the trial and demand millions without anybody saying they're pieces of shit. I don't know many stupid trials by heart, there are too many anyway so it would be a hell of a job  to learn them all. But I am not surprised that if I would say in public that I would want to fuck Hilary Duff she would sue my cock off. Not that I ever could anyway but just to make money. Hereby I openly declare that I wouldn't mind fucking Hilary Duff, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera etc.. I hate them all because of the music they make. The only positive thing about them is that they are good looking. (You can argue about the fact if that's a positive point. Good looking people are in no way better than ugly people, but just for the sake of this argument I'll say it's a positive point.) I don't have a girlfriend nor a boyfriend. Not in love either so I think I'm free to say that. I would love a one night stand with any of the previously mentioned women. After that they can burn in hell as far as I'm concerned. If they want to sue me for this? Fine , let them. My opinion won't change no matter how much they'd sue me for.  Once upon a time a lot of Europeans wanted to go to America. Currently most Europeans don't agree with the Iraq war, think Bush is an asshole and find most Americans stupid. The only Europeans who want to go to the USA are people who have to go there for business, holiday and ofcourse some politicians who want to discuss the Iraq war in Bush' bed. People like Blair, Balkenende and Berlusconi. They're Bush his bitches.  Once upon a time America had a decent governament. But people like Reagan, Bush sr. and nowadays Bush jr. took over. They're a bunch of cowboys with approximatly one braincell each. Reagan screwed up the economic state of the USA by increasing the state debts as if they didn't mind. Bush senior was a cowboy. So is his son. Bush junior started an illegal war for oil, Ignores Kyoto and is against gay marriages. There has been talked enough about the war. I'll just say I'm against it. Ignoring Kyoto means that Bush is partly responsible if the next generation can't survive on this planet because, for instance, the UV-radiation of the sun won't be blocked any more. And then his latest joke. Prohibiting gay marriages by law. Here in Holland there is a seperation between church and governament. The church has no influence on the laws. I think that's the same in America. Therefore it would be discrimination to prohibit gay people to have a wedding. A  S S  H O  L E
