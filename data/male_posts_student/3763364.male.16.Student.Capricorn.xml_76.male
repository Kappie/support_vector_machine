Take, for example, the counter-terrorist measures at the airports. Here my grandmother is, this 75-year old woman, trying to get on her flight. They take her bag, run it through the x-ray, then pull it, rip it to shreds, while she's watching in horror. After their extensive search, they remove a tiny screwdriver that an old woman would use to fix her glasses.  Oh my god! It's a 75 year old woman with a 3cm long screwdriver! Call the national fucking guard!  No Q-tips allowed either. I'm sorry, but if an elderly terrorist can kill the entire flight crew by jamming a Q-tip into their brains, there is something seriously SERIOUSLY wrong.  I dunno, I suppose an old woman COULD be dangerous, I mean, we do vastly underestimate them, don't we. We also treat them like garbage. They don't get any respect, we ship them off to a shoddy care centre when they become a burden. Marvelous. Might as well leave them out on northern ice floes to die.  Well, to all you seniors out there, take a stand! Embrace your life! Instead of a wheelchair, use your life insurance policy to buy you a ferrari! Don't bother with walkers, get some boy scout to carry your ass around to get his badge! Make them do the work! Don't get a hearing aid, ram a cone into your friggin ear! When you can't hear somebody, don't make it be your fault, yell "Speak up! Into the cone, fuckface!!!"  Bring back euthanasia! Really, though. If somebody is in the throes of death, in intense pain, suffering a severely low quality of life and just wants to stop being a burden on the healthcare system, LET THEM!
