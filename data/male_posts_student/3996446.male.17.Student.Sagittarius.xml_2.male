She was actually apologizing to me for the way things turned out and she said she still loves me and thinks about me all the time. I really dunno what the explitive (sorry I'm trying to cut back on my insane amount of cussing) I should do. Markita's got her own problems and I'd rather not inconvienice her with my own. Amy hates my guts, so I can't turn to her. I think it bothers Crystal in a way when I bring up my relationships. And my parents. Hahahahahaha. Sorry, that's just funny. I really don't have anyone but myself to ask for help this time. Bound to happen sooner or later. Got a lot on my plate this year. Freakin ROTC, and being a senior, and stayin away from my dad so when he says something wrong to me, the first thing I don't do is bloody his face, and so much more. My whole family gets on my nerves. And no, its not a stage in my life, i'll never get along with any of them, never have, never will. If you can't count on your friends and you can't count on your family, then you shouldn't count on yourself, everythings less disappointing that way.   I hope Kita's not reaching fot that stupid razor. I worry about her. I probably shouldn't so much cause she's not my Girlfriend, and she doesn't consider me a friend, but to me, she's one of the few friends i've got and well I went through a lot with her and its instilled some hardened feelings for her. (Sigh) And so does Sergio her boyfriend, well ex now, but still. I'm so confused. I have no idea what I should do about my life. Why does Lauren love me, I'm not even remotely near good-looking, let alone, dare I say, average. I'm a crappy boyfriend. I don't have anything to offer her now or in the future. I'm not rich. I'm not good at much, other than military stuff, which is the only damn thing in the world that seems to come natural to me. Well that and vid games like Halo, and Hitman. That doesn't leave much room to make her as happy as I think she should be. All I seem to be good at is pain and destruction. Its subconciously easy for me. Its all I seem to do. Look at Markita, I'm partly to blame for the cuts and scars she's got on her wrists. I hurt Lauren, the only person, other than Kita, whose made me feel happy and complete. Yea I'm still young and got a lot of crap ahead of me but I know what Love is. I just don't see Lauren's attraction to me. Or anyone else's for that matter. Well except Amy's, she just wanted to get fucked. Another thing I'm seemingly not good at. What a waste of life. I know i've probably got it better than half of the guys my age on this planet, but still, I kinda wish I could trade bodies with some homeless kid with AIDS in Africa. I'm babbling aren't I. Oh, well. Guess I should go, I feel kinda tired. Haven't been sleeping well for about well since Lauren,..........nevermind.
