The 1st period was a speech by an old skrewt about not wasting time and learn the fact that you come to school to study, not to play. Uh, DUH?! but i think only Kousuke Ueda is listening. The rest slept. ehehehe  2nd period was England. I got back my results. I got 100. DUH?! I am a native speaker from Singapore and don't get 100? I screw my balls man, but Kousuke got higher than me. That mugger. haiz. it was like something upon 105? eheheh, he got 102 and i got 101. but the teacher give a FUCK sh!t damn and rounded us all to 100  Had our break. Pitch the tennis ball onto the wall. My senior, Tsuyoshi Mabuchi, was sort of impressed. He needs to "ling mu xiang kan"(look at the person with another eye). ehehe. He also advised me to lift my leg up a little more higher. I dunno why but dad say it helps to boost the speed. Whatever.  3rd period was bio. Got back my paper and it was the first one i managed to have a grin on my face. 73. Satisfactory. many people failed though. ehehe, you guys better buck up. A foreigner got 73 okie.  4th period was home economics. BORING OLD SH!T. dozed off.  Ehehheeh.  Lunch was like CRAP. didn't even managed to finish the rice.  My lunch break was spent on playing baseball with the sec 3s. I struck some people out. ehehehe...  5th period was SOCIETY. omFg. I was afraid, but my fear was overcome by the joy when my result came to my desk. 75. not bad huh...  6th period was Maths and it was the BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT. I GOT ONLY 59! but i can't blame anyone because i didn'T have the textbook in the first place. After the swapping of seats in the 5th period, i was surrounded by girls and luckily nobody wanted to see my result. Kuge was fucking bitching around my bad mood.  okie, i met this girl i found it quite chio lar. But i don't really like her. I think she likes me. Whatever. Her name is called Takada and she sort of wanted to come near me everywhere i went. yea, at least she is chio unlike some Dog who bitch around and smack my head with hard substance (kuge lar). Okie. Takada met me near the canteen. She initiated the "hi there" and i waved back. Chihiro, my senior was also there and waved back. Somebody muttered "you know him?!". Wow, am i that famous?  went home and played com and bla bla bla... You should know. Supper was Udon.  yawnz, gotta sleep  muakz  eheheheheheheh  lolz  Thought of the day: Just Do It
