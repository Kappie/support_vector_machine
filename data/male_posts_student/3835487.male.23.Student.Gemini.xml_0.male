Just been working on my paper and hanging out, going to movies, etc. Same old, same old. My boy Bobby now has a  urlLink blog . Go check it out. He's probably more creative than I am with mine.     I guess I can talk about movies galore. Perhaps I should just turn this into a movie review site, because that's mostly all I talk about. This weekend I saw both "Harold and Kumar Go to Whitecastle" and "Bourne Supremacy." First, "Harold and Kumar." This movie is hilarious. Go see it now. Although it seems to run a bit long at the end, it is worth it. Any movie where Neal Patrick Harris plays himself, steals a car, does drugs, and gets strippers has to be funny. Not to mention the fact that it has the MILF guy from "American Pie" and the assistant guy from "Van Wilder" as its stars. When I originally saw the preview I thought this movie would be completely stupid, but it is far funnier than "Dodgeball" and funnier than "Anchorman." I won't ruin anything, but again, I will highly recommend it.     "Bourne Supremacy" was kind of a disappointment. I was unaware that it had a different director from the first movie until Smith told me halfway through, which explained the chaotic style in which the film was shot. This chaos takes away from the car chases and fight scenes because it is hard to tell what is going on. I feel like they wasted some really cool stunts with the bad camera work. I understand that directors feel that this camera style is a really cool thing to do now and adds to the "action feel" of a movie but I've never cared for it. Also, I just felt like this movie was almost filler to get the series to the third film. I know it was based on a book so it shouldn't feel that way, but it does. I don't know if they are planning on ending with three films or not, but I hope they do four instead. Not because I'm really excited to see two more of these movies, but because everything is a trilogy now so maybe they should change it up. Think about all the trilogies out there.     Speaking of trilogies, the new "Star Wars" film is entitled "Revenge of the Sith." It's actually a pretty good title. Obviously, it's better than the last two cheesy titles.     Waco is getting an Alamo Draft House. I can't tell you how much that rules. It will bring a different kind of crowd and different kinds of movies. Not only will it be cool to see art films and whatever else they will show, but it will also be cool to make fun of all the weirdos who never left the house before the Draft House opened. I guarantee you all the dorks of Waco will congregate there. Apparently they are also developing land across from the "awesome" new Central Texas Marketplace into another shopping center. I'm hoping that we get a digital theater now since the theaters here still run on film which tends to lead to some sort of problem every time I see a movie.     Not much else has been going down. My parents are gone so I am still housesitting and bored out of my mind. I feel very cooped up sometimes. It's not like I don't get out but it's still frustrating. I think they come back this week but I am unsure since my dog ate their itinerary. She also ate one of my PS2 controllers, and those things are expensive.     Oh, and I think I talked to a member of the Roots on the phone last night, but I am unsure about it. It was very strange.     Peace Out.    Alex
