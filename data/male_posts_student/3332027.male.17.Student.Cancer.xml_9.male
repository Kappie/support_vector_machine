I found this online and i thought it was interesting:   TuXeDO MiRaGE    At a crescent-shaped chalet, I take off my star piercings. What do I do? My heart, my heart is full. Should the fireworks become stars, should love be put out in the dark, Please don't take the kiss away. It's okay if you steal me away with the scent of velvet To a love that this heart met out in the galaxy!  The cloak of the night extends outward in rainbow colors Love me more and more Tuxedo mirage Tuxedo mirage  The canary music box softly fades out. What do I do? My heart, my heart is plugged. Should the tears become stars, should the carousel disappear, Please don't take the kiss away. I want to be pulled in by your glance of velvet To a love that this heart pledged out in the galaxy!  Hold me close, gently, amid the storm of flowers Stay near me forever and ever Tuxedo mirage    Misty's Song    Out here in the quiet of the night  Beneath the stars and moon  We both know we got something on our minds  You won't admit but it's true  You look at me  I look away    I wanna tell you what I'm feeling  But I don't know how to start  I wanna tell you but now I'm afraid  That you might break my heart  Oh why should anything so easy  Ever be so hard to do  I wanna tell you what I'm feeling  and to say that I love you   I practice all the things that I could say  Line by line, every word  I tell myself today would be the day  But every time I lose my nerve  I look at you  You look away   I wanna tell you what I'm feeling  But I don't know how to start  I wanna tell you but now I'm afraid  That you might break my heart  Oh why should anything so easy  Ever be so hard to do  I wanna tell you what I'm feeling  And to say that I love you   Why?  Why do you turn away?  It must be you're afraid like me.  I try but I can't pretend that I  Don't feel for you the way I do  Can't you see?   I wanna tell you what I'm feeling  But I don't know how to start  I wanna tell you but now I'm afraid  That you might break my heart  Oh why should anything so easy  Ever be so hard to do  I wanna tell you what I'm feeling  And to say that I love you
