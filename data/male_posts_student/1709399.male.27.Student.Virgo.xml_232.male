The last episode of the Sitcom would be telecast on 6th May. Friends is about to become History ( of course the re-runs will always be there) .   What makes the sitcom tick ?  The humour in Friends is genuinely funny and the vibe between the six characters is great so much so that the  friday office aircooler talks are always centered on the previous day episode of Friends or Seinfeld.                                   Though Seinfeld remains my favourite comedy sitcom , I have always enjoyed friends. Chandler  Phoebe are my favourites. Probably one day I will buy the entire episodes of Friends on DVD/VCD !
