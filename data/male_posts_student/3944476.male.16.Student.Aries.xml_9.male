Today my history techer played a prank on us. She claimed that we all did badly for some shit assignment and she's gonna bring us to the Deputy Principle (bitch by name of Goh Pok Kien) and we're supposed to explain to the bitch why we did so badly. The, while walkin towards the office, she stopped us and pulled a sign that says "GOTCHA!". Bleah. I had creatviely came up with an excuse and was kinda panickin coz i got scolded from the bitch before bout the lying incident  (read ".....") . Shit, now i can't recall it. But waddahell, Mrs Lajender (history teacher) is one of the coolest teachers around, so i would like to thank her for this memoriable moment.   Today, i also found out the number of people that hates KEFLI. Check out my  TRUE BLUE LOSER  entry. As of 3/8/2004, 7:04pm, there are two anonymous comments bout him. Check it out. It seems that many people hates him. Well, i dont blame them, he's a loser for sure. Read RYAN'S (412) blog,  urlLink http://gayfag.blogspot.com/ . There's an entry bout some interestin incident. Words that had been used to describe Kefli by Josephians themselves. " Loser,Homer Simpsons, Backstabbin S-O-B, Bastard,etc."   As a Josephian, i decided to check out how many more people hates KEFLI.       My interview with guy 1.   Me: Eh, you guys hate Kefli ah?   Guy1: Ya. He's an idiot, and likes to put words into people's mouth.   Me: Really?    Guy1: Ya, he hates me. And everytime i make a mistake, he'll scold me.   Me: Wad an ass..Chill man, i've experienced that before.      My interview with Guy2   Me:Eh, you guys like Kefli?   Guy2: Not anymore...      My interview with Guy3   Me: Eh, Kefli also hates you ah?   Guy3: Ya... He seems to target me all the time. Just coz i never do his work. It's not as if i'm the only one.   Me: True, true. A lot of people never do his work.   Guy3: Aiya, that guy's a loser ah.. Try to teach people english, but his english sucks. And sometimes, when we corrects his english, he'll get pissed off.       Well, these are just a few people who hates Kefli. Obviously i can't type out of all them right? By the way, these interviews are REAL and i cannot reveal the identities of these people as their safety will be at stake. I bet that there are more out there. The question is... Who to be blamed? The students or the loser? My opinion is.. THE LOSER is to be blamed and no doubt bout that.         P/S: This is NOT an anti-Kefli message. I'm just merely statin facts and stating how i feel bout him. So please hate Kefli at your own will and not because you have read this entry.      PP/S: Before i go, check this Japanese babe out man. Name: Chisato Morishita. Can be found at RYAN's blog.
