See i used to keep an actual written journal for like 2 years but then i kinda grew away from that, but i must say, within the pages of that journal are some of my deepest, mostrevealing thoughts and emotions. Of course they're abit irrelevant at this point seeing as they were simply emotions of the moment and nothing more. yet when i look back at those pages all those emotions come flooding back, if only for a brief moment. weird how that works, and then i end up thinking of how stupid/silly i was 2-3 years ago. oy i'm rambling, but hey! this is MY journal thingy and i can rant if i want to! so yea! there! alright, well there shall be more to come, until then...  -Brendan Michael
