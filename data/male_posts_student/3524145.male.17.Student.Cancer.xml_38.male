God... bring me along... take me ... mould me.... walk with me... i am tired... very tired... please.... touch my heart once again.... i do not wan to be alone... and i know you are with me.... ^^..  I guess i am not having a very good spiritual life... pls pray for me k?^^... anyway... May God bring me back to the path again...   yesterday i guess realise lots of things in my life... many problems solved... i think i realise what God really want my life to be... and when to do what... i guess i am just not obedient and careful enough... just with to be more sensitive to the people around and most important to God.... *God Lead Me*
