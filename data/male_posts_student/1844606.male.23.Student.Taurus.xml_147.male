Now that its beginning to warm up (and that's relative due to living in Illinois) I pledge to walk more.  Cause I saw my father's eating habbits over the weekend and realized  a) Genetics are not going to give me a washboard stomach  b) I don't want my stomach hanging over my belt, creating some weird fashion statement.  So I walked for 30 min after dropping my car off.  I don't know if my nose is plugged, but I was breathing hard at points.  Not good.  I'm also sweating heavily after little tasks, which would concern me except that two or three different meds I'm taking all have side effects of "excessive sweating."  Which is fantastic now, and should be positively stink-rific when summer rolls around.   PS  I keep having dreams that I'm in Wrigley Field.
