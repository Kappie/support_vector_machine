Today, Mr. Principal came over the intercom at about, oh, 1:20, and said that because of the approaching storms (Tropical Storm Bonnie, Hurricane Charley), school would be cancelled.  The whole class jumped up in excitement, including Mr. Economics Teacher, joyfully at the hearing of this exciting news.  Then, at 2:34, Mr. Principal (who was right after Mr. Assistant Principal, making his daily checklist of how things were going in the school), came on again, and said that they were going to go ahead and clear the school.  Then the bell rang 5 minutes early.  Then, when me and Melinda were walking out of the building at around, oh, 2:48, the power went out.  And then we were stuck in traffic in the parking lot.  Must have been another accident.  And that would have been bad.  But, now for the not yay.  Of course, we're going to have to make that day up, but, that's not a "not yay" event.  The not yay event of the day is the respect I don't get in the yearbook room.  Me and my co-editor, Lauren, were holding a brainstorming session for our section, and I got nothing but total disrespect from 7/10 of the yearbook staff.  We managed to come up with 13 ideas in about 45 minutes.  So, I told everyone that they had homework, to come up with ideas and write them on paper for us, due Monday.  I'm curious to see who will do it, and who will have not even listened to me.   Hey, I just realized.  The next post I make here will be the 100th post on this blog alone.  So, yay to that.  I'll make that post later on tonight.  Tomorrow is Friday the 13th, and we're going to get hit by 2 hurricanes!  Yay! (Sarcastically, of course)  So, we'll see how that goes.  And, with that being said, I'm out for now.  I'll be back later on tonight with my 100th post.  So, until then, The River es mucho tiempo libre!  (The River has much free time...learned that in Spanish today.)
