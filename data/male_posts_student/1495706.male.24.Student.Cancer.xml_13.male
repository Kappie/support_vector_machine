I check my voicemail, and my Grandma sang me "Happy Birthday" like she's done every year as far back as I can remember.  Then, I go online to this message board I post at and people are wishing me a good day there, too.  People I don't know in person, whose real names and identities are shrouded in mystery.    I feel so loved!  It's awesome!  Also, they opened a smoothie place nearby as part of that evil thing called "gentrification."  So I get to have a real smoothie for the first time in months.  How much ass does that kick?
