Games in the afternoon was cancelled, so I went home and played on Xbox Live with a friend for a couple of hours. Later in the afternoon, I had a mock practical driving test, which I didn't do quite so well in because of the pressure.   Yesterday was similarly light on work, but geography was interesting at least. After school, I went out with my dad to practice driving while the football was on and we just went over a couple of manoeuvres for an hour. We got back in time for the second half and England beat Switzerland 3 - 0. After the match I had my first game of Pro Evolution Soccer 3 which lived up to my crap presentation, good gameplay expectations, then watched 24 and Big Brother.  Earlier this morning I purchased my first music from iTunes which felt nice and legal. I bought three songs by Avril Lavigne (don't laugh, a few are quite good!) and one by Blur. I had to update my iPod software, but otherwise, the process was hassle free and quick. iTunes even puts your purchased music into a separate folder for you, which is useful.  Right now I'm sitting in our Mini on a motorway, writing a blog on my PDA at 70mph. I'm on my way to Manchester for a university open day tomorrow and if your wondering how I managed to publish this entry on the road, I didn't, it's just adjusted the date and time to look like it. Wireless broadband access on our motorways - that'll be the day.
