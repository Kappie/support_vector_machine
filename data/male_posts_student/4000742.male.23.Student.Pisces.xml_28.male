For many people it was a stressful experience, stemming mainly from the fact that they hadn't studied most subjects through the 5 weeks in a regular fashion. Personally, I don't take much tension about any exams - it leads to unnecessary disturbance of mental peace. In order not to be anxious at exam time, I try to study beforehand so that the last day is only for revision of some more important points.         I wasn't able to implement this approach in its totality in this exam, but still have been fairly tension-free and have written the exams coolly. In fact, I have enjoyed writing the papers.          There were two exams today - Economics in the morning and Communications in the afternoon. A total of 5 hours. Economics paper was full of theory except one question where a report from the Indian Express on glut of onions in the market and the plight of Rajasthan farmers was to be analysed in its economic dimensions. The paper was too lengthy for me and I could write only 85 marks worth (out of 100).         Communications paper was again very descriptive with lots of caselets to be read and analysed, an invitation letter, two essays etc. This one went much better.         The QAM professor has released solutions to the exam and I find that as far as answers are concerned, I have got all of them correct. This doesn't mean I will get full marks, however, because there are marks for specific steps and for neatness. But it's a comforting thought.          Overall, pretty satisfied with my performance. According to the new time-table, for the first 3 days of the week, classes start at 8am (it used to be 9.10am earlier). So everybody in class will have to practice waking up early.
