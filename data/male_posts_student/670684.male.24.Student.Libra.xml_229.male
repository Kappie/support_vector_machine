I was disappointed with  urlLink If Beale Street Could Talk  at first...slow pacing, simple word choice, and a plot that I figured out within ten pages.  I assumed this book caught up with time; his vision became cliche.  At page 100, I took it all back...Baldwin was writing in three or four styles, mixing words with rhythms, creating certain characters through the words he used (everyone spoke in the same tone, for the most part), and creating moods for certain moments (same sentence structure in jail, in Puerto Rico, at the loft of Tish and Fonny's dreams).  But Sharon's trip to Puerto Rico was the apex of briliance.  After finishing it, I was reminded of John Grisham.  But only in the sense that John Grisham wants to write like James Baldwin did...he just can't.    Late plane.  Lots of turbulence.  I enjoy people who do not ask me "How was your flight?"  I can't think of a less original way of starting a conversation.  With a complete stranger, or rare acquaintance, I'm willing to forgive.  But family seems hell-bent on starting my trips with "How was your flight?"  "Fine," I used to say, quickly pushing to the next topic of conversation...I know these people, and there is no reason to reacclimate to each other; I know my hours out will be scrutinized on a nightly basis, so you should know what to expect when you see me.  So nowadays I answer them truthfully.  No one asked me the question today, and it was so pleasant.    One day in Dallas.  Not even that, really.  Played a lot of EverQuest with Daniel Harr this evening, out hunting a Plane raid to get him experience and a sweet earring.  My favorite times playing EverQuest are usually with him, sitting in his office, the dimly lit office with a flat-screen monitor and large view window to the right of the desk set-up...life stops in this room for EverQuest.  We grab beers, tell each other that the other doesn't know how to play the game, and regail each other with stories of our addictions to this whored out gaming device.    Tomorrow I get up, get the car looked over, get it serviced, grab lunch with an ex-girlfriend (really, The ex-girlfriend...I think everyone has one that stands out above the others, and as long as you don't date someone for a longer period of time on a grand scale, The ex-girlfriend stays the same, sitting on a less than boastful perch until thankfully usurped), grab some real shitty bear in Muskogee, and hit Arkansas.  Golf tourney at a little Par 3 where I might win some cold bank...maybe.    I can't get that excited about this stop, really.  Maybe if I had found Dana Beyert's number, called her, set up a lunch date to catch up, see what happened with Willie, hear her laugh, see her smile...but I've got an old number.  We ended on pretty good terms.  We were walking back to her loft, holding hands even though her boyfriend was behind us, remembering the past and enjoying the present.  As we crossed the street, I wondered if anything could ever happen with her, if I really was interested in making something wonderful between the two of us, or if she was nothing more than the ultimate notch on the belt...the one that is within reach and out of reach, where you can touch it with the tip of your finger, but when you try to grip it you tip it over and it spills all over.  But I knew I wouldn't find out.  She had Willie.  Willie was an incredible guy.  I could write and make her laugh, but he could make her laugh and he had abs.  She liked me, I know, and those friends who think I was pining for someone out of my league are wrong...a friend can't notice the simple touch at the right moment, a spontaneous smile at first glance, or an unsolicited back rub just because you are you.  I came along at the wrong time, and when the time was right, I wasn't there.  When I left her that night, I knew I wouldn't talk to her or see her until we ran into each other again, per chance.  Calling her Shreveport cell phone wasn't the per chance I hoped for.
