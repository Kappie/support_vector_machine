I looked out from my window and saw a couple arguing. They were shouting in mandarin so I didnt quite understand. The shouting ended after 15min. Just nice for the start of a roller coaster match. It was a really bumpy ride. Before I could even settle down, England scored after 2min. But after that England lost its shape as McRooney had to pull out. They were hardly attacking. Portugal punished them with a well deserved equaliser. England should have won the game in the dying seconds. Why on Earth was Sol Campbell's goal disallowed? I still cant understand. The match went into extra time. Portugal scored through Rui Costa. What a goal? A thunderbolt. Lampard equalise for England. The match went to penalties. Up step David Beckham, the most popular soccer player in the world but the least popular player in SANS world. He blasted his penalty over the bar. Did anyone tell Becks he was playing soccer and not rugby? He blamed the pitch. He should blame himself. He let the entire nation down.England went on to lose the penalty shootout. England's Euro 2004 dream go crashing. So close yet so far. Boy! This tournament is getting so exciting. I better go and catch some sleep. Later got France vs Greece. Adios
