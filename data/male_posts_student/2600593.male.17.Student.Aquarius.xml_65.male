      I just add a list of the blogs I try to read to my links page. Also for Engish I have to write a Cause and Effect essay, and I am going to do it on the Open Source Movement. If you have any suggestion email me.  Plus I am starting a Email help service, send any computer related question and get it answered for free.

      kill blogpost.exe
