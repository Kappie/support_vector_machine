I´d like to flyin' away from Spain to.........Los Angeles or Miami where i can speak "my english" and make it better (but i don´t really mind the place while it was away from Spain). Don´t be afraid! I love Spain but i am all the year here and i like change my way, u no... So, the problem is that i have no money and i can´t spend the holidays that i was thinkin' in. By the way, here in Spain i can spend a gr8 summer but at north(where i live) the sun doesn´t appear for Ages!!!!! (Almost it seems......) and i can´t go to the beach and do sun bathin' :( sniff sniff  As u see, this could be the borest summer holiday i have ever had.........But i must wait until September to check if it was. So, wot do u think about this?? Send me ur comments PD: Scuse my english........ ;D
