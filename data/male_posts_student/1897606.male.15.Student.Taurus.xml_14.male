These words are coming back dammit, whether you like it or not.   DYNAMITE  - This word just rocks. Mind you, it always must be spelled in all caps, or said with excessive emphasis.  righteous  - Some great old school slang. Undeniably fun to say.  The Pirate Collection  - Pirates rock, so pirate language rocks as well. Yarr, aye, avast, matey, these are all beyond cool.  indeed  - Beats "yes" any day. Just some rockin! stuff.  rockin!  - Translates roughly to "cool stuff!" The exclamation is an integral part of the word.  If you don't use these words, you're a loser.
