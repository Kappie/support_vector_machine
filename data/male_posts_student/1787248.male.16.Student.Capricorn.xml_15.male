I wish I could have seen their whole set yesterday, but that's what happens when you believe the advertisements. From now on I shall be 15 minutes early for anything and everything. Or an hour, if meeting Taking Back Sunday.   So I am bored. Boredom is the story of the summer. Today was quite possibly the most boring day ever. Days after concerts when you're not really tired = really a downer. I was so up and happy yesterday, now all of a sudden I'm just sitting around the house, and I feel like going out and doing things. I couldn't even go to Game Castle today. Effing Wednesdays. I hate Wednesdays. Everyone always talks about how they hate Mondays, but Wednesdays are my least favorite day. Mondays and Tuesdays are the "recovery from the weekend and talk about your weekend days" and thursday and friday are the "It's almost the weekend" days. Wednesday is just that one day that drags out where there's really nothing to do except wait for the days where "it's almost the weekend".   Ranting over, I'd just like to say that I hate the Divas Overload era of Raw Deal. I miss the days when I could still play action cards. I miss the days when I could still play maneuver cards. Hell, I miss the days when I could still  play  Raw Deal. Being a manager sucks, but someone's gotta do it. I guess it's better than jobbing because I'm not prepared for some random off the wall deck, though.
