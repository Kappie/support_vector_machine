Oh well they were funny dreams though. I had one last night and one this evening when I was napping from 6pm-8pm. Up until now I still don't get why I could dream about things, but yeah as I describe them right now I'll talk about my reasons why I think I thought of this stuff.  Ok so my first dream...which I will label   Resident Evil...in Cambridge    The morning was sunny when our hero Joe Chan wakes up. It was around 9:30am, and he has just woke up. Preparing for his day, he does his usual hygiene biz in the washroom, and then precedes to his downstairs to eat breakfast. After finishing his breakfast, he then heads to school for Report Card Pick-Up Day. It was June 24th, 2004.  Arriving at school, he gets out of the car and then goes into the cafeteria to get his report card. Upon heading out and about to wait for a ride, he then sees his math teacher, Mr. Gilbert:  Mr Gilbert: Joe. Joe: Mr. Gilbert. Mr. G: I saw you didn't come to instructional day. Would you like to see your exam anyways? Joe: Well, I didn't come because I DIDN'T want to see my exam *ha ha* but, alright sure might as well  *Mr. G then hands Joe the report card*  Joe: O M G! I TOTALLY BOMBED THE EXAM!? Whoa.  Our hero, shocked at his mark, had gone faar out of the heights from Joe fail and Chinese Fail. He even fell far below White Pass. He White Failed. Our hero's day had just been nailed with a gargantuan wall of depression. 50% on his math exam *by the way really I got 80%.* Our hero then skips off the Head 2 Head proposition he made with some of his friends, and then just got a ride home.  *Joe now forgets most of the dream around here*  Our hero now dazed and wondering where the heck he was *due to lack of memory from the storyteller* now finds himself, along with his HYPE fellowship friends at the Cambridge Heritage College, the same place LCAC had held their May Camp in 2004. However, our hero feels something is not right about this place this time. However, unable to diagnose the situation, Joe just chills along with his friends up there in the main Rec building, until night came along...  "Man it's getting late, I think I'm heading back," says Joe. "Wait up man we're comin' too," Josh and Gavin say as they come along with him.  Heading out the door, the three of them then begin their 75m trek back to their dorm. All was quiet in the midst of the night, until a silhouette of another figure appeared off in the distance. The three, conversing amongst themselves, then remembered the camp owner saying how they were the only ones there for the weekend. The figure, who seemed unaware of the group's presence, then left, in a very slow moving manner, as though it was dragging itself.  "Wonder what that thing was," thought Joe to himself.  The three, who decide to conclude it was just a local hoodlum, make also the descision about not worrying about him and continue back to their dorm. Opening the door then, they then use their keycard to access the inside of the dorm, and are heading up the stairs when from behind them a heavy breathing came...  A man, strangely resembling  Dave Rutt  *Stage Band X head...I don't know HOW this dream came together* was standing at the bottom of the stairs. However, for some REALLY strange reason...he was a zombie (How can a average group of 15-year-old dudes determine this? Well, from experience playing much Silent Hill 3 and seeing clips of Resident Evil...Joe owns the movie =P). The three, who realize what the thing is, begin running as the demonic, pale, flesh-rotting figure *not offending you Dave* begins to slowly drag itself up the stairs (yeah my dream has the slow moving evil figure and the frantic good guys also). The three fortunately make it to their room, where they then decide to brainstorm about what to do. They already know the following:   -Zombies are bad -Zombies hurt when they bite (well, probably) -There were more than one of these zombie things; there are at least TWO -They had to find a way to tell the others back in the Rec Centre   Finally concluding to a plan, the three then decide that they would climb out the window and run back to tell the others. However, our hero Joe, being the productive one he was, decided to walk out the front door. So while seeing off Gavin and Josh, Joe then walks out of the room and locks the door behind him. Walking down the stairs then, he then sees the same zombie, (the Dave Rutt resembling one) waiting at the bottom of the stairs. Joe then realizing that he screwed up the plan execution, RUNS up the stairs as the zombie chases him down. Our hero then jumps out the window, with the zombie floating out behind him. Our hero recovering from the fall then begins running towards a construction site. Crossing the property line, he then looks behind him and sees no zombie. He then looks around, and sees that no zombie was around. Our hero, who is safe, then hears the shrieks and screams of the zombies as they are being owned by the HYPE kids (yes they sound different, I don't think a dead figure can scream as high pitched as Steph, Carmen, Lina, Pow Pow OR Rebecca) and begins his trek back with a crowbar to the camp, ready to fend off any flesh-eating, flesh-rotting, odour-resembling-old-fish zombies that dare to stand in his way. Our hero is Joe.   That was the conclusion of dream I remember from last night. After finally waking up from the dream at 930am with my alarm clock jolting me awake, I then remember it was all a dream, and I am once again relieved that I did not totally blow my math exam haha. Waking up, I go through morning routine, and leave my house to meet Arjun at Head 2 Head at around 10am.  Getting there a wee bit early, I then wait for him for 15 minutes. After him not coming by 10:30am, I then decide to abandon this idea and go grab my report card.  So I walk there, get greeted by Mr. Dayus and Coach Doba, and then grab my report card and go. I wound up with a 86.3 average, so I'm on the honour roll still PLUS I get one of those copper plated medals for saying I'm over 85% average =P. I then go to the music hall to check who's in Jazz band...and yes I made it. Unfortunately Arjun got cut, but Pourier made it on Trombone too. So heading out, I call mom to tell her I'm going to Head 2 Head with John, Josh and some other people, and also the fact that I got a decent report card. Seeing Pourier heading out also with a trombone, since he found out he made it so he said he's practicing over summer. Well after some chatting, eventually we somehow got to me telling him to come along to Head 2 Head also. So we head out then and meet up with John. Arjun just called then and said he had JUST woke up at 11am. Well anyways afterwards Josh had also just arrived at his stop at Dundas and Richmond. So I told Josh to walk towards Dundas and Clarence, as that's where we were. Josh though somehow got onto King and Clarence, and then I had to run to find him. Eventually we figured out where he was *via cell phones* and then FINALLY we began gaming for the next 5 hours...well for Josh 4, and Pourier 2.  We started off with Battlefield, and would play that through the 45 minutes that Arjun came for in the end and for a bit when Colin and Mitch came also. So our afteroon was filled with BF, EE, Halo, and also Call of Duty, which with more people I found out it is actually pretty fun. So yeah that pretty much took up most of the afternoon, with me and John taking the bus @ 5pm. Mitch and Colin had more time since they came later, so they stayed back. Getting to the bus stop I also saw Stefan, who was also takin' the Dundas. Apparently in EuroCup England and Portugal were tied 1-1. We kinda got to talkin' bout soccer, though I didn't really keep track of EuroCup, but yeah World Cup...I still watch that closely =P...when it's on of course. Got off the bus then, hopped onto Whitehills bus, and then got off and walked home.  Getting home, I watched some TV, drummed, and then took a nap for 2 hours.  This was when my second dream happened. This dream wasn't AS weird...but still kinda on the unusual side haha. I don't know if any of the Martha TCers actually read this blog, but if you guys do, well here's a dream about none other than TEAM MAFFFAAA!   Martha Reunion...if it happened at Joe's   Actually I don't remember much about this dream, but here goes (it's kinda short):   The evening in Joe's house was filled with laughter and jokes with Team Martha 2004 all chattin' around in Joe's place. The house was packed with the 30 or so kids that was part of Team Martha in 2004, all just chatting about their summer so far and what they've done since March Break. Most of them have you know done the usual, chilled, and everything *daily thoughts I suppose in real life* except one person,  Karen , somehow became a hip-hop artist *I think I've been listening to Masia One a WEE bit too much.* So she pulled out her recently released CD, which was kinda BOKAN! but the CD was the main point. No one ever put in the CD for some reason, and we all stared at the somewhat BOKAN! case and the shiny CD that it encased within...so shiny.   See it's short. That's all I really remembered. I saw everyone, but once Karen pulled out the CD, the whole group was just quiet. We all just stared, and then I woke up because sleeping with three blankets gets really hot in the summer, and me being the smart one decided to sleep with three blankets. Anyways waking up, I have a bowl of "joak" for dinner and then for dessert some "yee mai sui."  Currently I'm on MSN. Karen and Steph are both in HK right now, soaking up the the slightly magnified-radiation rays of the sun, and of course eating all the good food in HK...mmm Dim Sum every morning was l33t when I went there in 1998. I was going to go again in 2003, but SARS...and you know yeah it sucked. Talking on MSN, I told Josh, Gavin, and Dave Rutt about my really messed up dream, and also was filled in every few minutes by Maisie about the show "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy." I never watched the show, but yeah she decided to ignore that factor and still jabber on about it. Also when talking about her receiving her orders or somethin' like that for cadets, we got into a talk about how she received a call instead of papers. Eventually it led her to explain it this way:     ¤×º°`°º× Lil' Buffalo ×º°`°º× ¤   says: cuz i'm leaving for camp the next day , n i gotta b home to get my departure orders Joe...so NOW the cool dreams come rolling in says: o0o0o departure orders...so militaryish Joe...so NOW the cool dreams come rolling in says: it's called a sheet of paper FYI!   ¤×º°`°º× Lil' Buffalo ×º°`°º× ¤   says: sort of....   ¤×º°`°º× Lil' Buffalo ×º°`°º× ¤   says: but they call u   ¤×º°`°º× Lil' Buffalo ×º°`°º× ¤   says: cuz i won't see them until the day that i have to leave Joe...so NOW the cool dreams come rolling in says: so theyre papers.    ¤×º°`°º× Lil' Buffalo ×º°`°º× ¤   says: noooooooo   ¤×º°`°º× Lil' Buffalo ×º°`°º× ¤   says: they call u stupid!   ¤×º°`°º× Lil' Buffalo ×º°`°º× ¤   says: wait...that sounded wierd   ¤×º°`°º× Lil' Buffalo ×º°`°º× ¤   says: they call u   ¤×º°`°º× Lil' Buffalo ×º°`°º× ¤   says: and ur stupid   ¤×º°`°º× Lil' Buffalo ×º°`°º× ¤   says: hehe i call u stupid!   I don't know if you guys get that...but yeah read the part where they say "They call you stupid!" and I think you'll understand how it came out kinda funny.  Anyways, off to do something else that may seem more productive than blogging...and probably is. I've typed enough for today. Gonna sleep earlier tonight. Have to get to Masonville Library by 12pm to do Volunteer training.  I'm out. Later.
