As I perused through my collection of media a thought occurred to me. I'm sure it's not the first time the thought has occurred at all - originality is difficult to come by, at times our lives are an exercise in the derivative. I began to evaluate, as I'm sure many have done before me, how much of Japanese culture is informed by the attacks on HIroshima and Nagasaki. With the war in Iraq looming I decided to purchase some literature that I believed would help me reflect on the nature of the armed conflict. The Dark Knight Returns - Frank Miller. Slaughter House Five - Vonnegut. Watchmen - Alan Moore. Three vastly different perspectives on conflict.   Examining my experiences with Japanese culture - my visit there, the video games I own and the movies I have watched, it was interesting to contemplate how their culture was the only one on the planet to date which had been devastated by an atomic attack. The firebombing in Dresden dwarfed the casualties of both the atomic strikes combined - yet somehow it goes unnoticed - perhaps merely toying with fire and shrapnel simply wasn't different enough in comparison to rending the bonds of an atom. I think I'll give this some more thought and post later. Now it's time for dinner.
