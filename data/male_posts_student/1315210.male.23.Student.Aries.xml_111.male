Chill out music is really really great for those who like to jus bum around doing nothing or chill out and have some time to themselves..........relax and listen...........also there are some lounge music albums tailored for certain purposes, namely, "Erotic Lounge"...............actually after listening to it, there wasnt anything erotic abt it cept for the song titles........ but then again, think it's made with women in mind, guyz are visual creatures, we dun need music to get it going..........all we need is a room with a woman in sexy lingerie.........now THAT'S an erotic lounge..............  anywayz, ladies and gents, kick back and relak with a martini/scotch/cordon bleu in hand...............
