NOW this may possibly be my last post before i head back to NE. Later guys and gals! once i get back home, im going to have alot of gifts to give out. so enjoy all! im still scrambling to find gifts, like shot glasses, and according to my host family they dont have shot glasses, so ill find a sake glass that looks like a shot glass.
