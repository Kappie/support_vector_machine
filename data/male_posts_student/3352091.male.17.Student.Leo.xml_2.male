The most incredible thing hit me today while i was getting my dreads done(By the way, excellent job kyla) it was weird in a way because doin this and then shaving all but the facial hair on my chin, it was like not creating a new me but moving on in a way. I look a little younger than i like but this feeling i have now is amazing, I have finally not forgotten a certain someone but somehow this little transformation has helped me accept a change in life, and i have decided not to look back on it. When friends are lost, dont try to win them back because if you were a true friend they werent lost because of you, rather dont assert any effort other than that you normally did( saying hey, conversations if they can carry one and want to, etc) If they truly were your friend in the first place they will come back and if they dont, then so be it. I have moved on in my life and seeing old doesnt make me feel as though i am running from an emotionally painful past but rather healing and growing/accepting the future and becoming it. For all of you with heartaches or stress or whatever it may be, lifes to short to dwell on it. Dwelling only makes the pain sharpen, believe me i did it and i know. As i said accept it and heal into the future for change often occurs and if we spend our whole life trying to fight it, we spend our life fighting our own life(if you can understand that).
