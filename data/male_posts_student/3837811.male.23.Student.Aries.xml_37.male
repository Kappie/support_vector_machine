Tomolo is the last day of my mobilisation standby, *prays dont tio tomolo* lol  Watched Shi Zhi Lu Kou on channelU just now, got tis lady (Jin someting Yan, dont rem the name) in one group with Jacky. She got small eyes (dan yan pi). And i actually find her really cute....Ok so, if u read one of my prev postings, i've got one on Linda the VJ/Singer, who got small eyes also, from Taiwan. I mentioned that i like girls with small eyes in that posting. Then come to tink of it, of all my frends, only two got small eyes if i never rem wrongly.. And on the streets i seldom see people with small eyes, even as u were browsing the pictures from friendster, where did all the small eyes people go? Lol  Ok, i guess most people in singapore wants big eyes, as big as possible.. I do agree big eyes are nicer.. But then small eyes also got its own personality, my two frens with the small eyes looked cute with their overall appearance, guess they are more suited for small eyes, haha. Oh well, people got to live with their eyes somehow, no matter its big or small, they've got their own character. But some ppl do go for surgery to make their eyes become shuang yan pi.. if shuang yan pi suits you, so be it, wat if it doesnt? There is a certain risk in it too, i guess i dont agree with cosmetic surgery much....  On the other hand, imagine aliens with small eyes, doesnt it look strange? lol   Current Mood: Curious Current Music: Avril Lavigne - Forgotten
