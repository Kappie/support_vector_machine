I wish upon a star that tomorrow will be a good day. A day that will live on in infamy, or in our lives anyway... Tomorrow, to state the obvious, is dooms day. D-day, DA day, yar. lar. Mike.  I remember, a wear ago, on this day, Miss E.Lim, brought us to the hall for a wake up call. And we were all like "oh man! I need to leave so that I can go home and study NOW!!!!!" I think I was sitting with Kester. So tomorrow, will be deja vu. Except in a different sort of way. I'll be on the real receiving end.  I knew without a doubt that I wanted to open my envelope with only one person beside me. Things have changed now and although I would like to cry to her, I'm now embarrassed to. It's complicated. I feel twisted inside. Twisted in a confused sort of way. Am I making any sense? Yes I am. Oh great, now I'm answering my questions and talking to myself? What next? Anyway, I asked her, and she said that she'd sit with me. I'm not sure if that's what I want, but I'll take it and see how it goes. I love her. I know this is love. It isn't unrequited. It's just a semi-acknowledged mutual love. Err... ya, see, I told you it was complicated.  I'm slightly nervous, but not really. I don't really think about it that much. I am hoping for the best and expecting the worst. That way, when I get a scrape, I'll be joyful. Another wonderful theory brought to you by Leon .Inc. I will look at it this way, just as I do for all major events in my life henceforth.  Thy will be done.
