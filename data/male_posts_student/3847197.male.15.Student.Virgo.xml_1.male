We started talking just like old friends. The problem is, I can't seem to remember her as a friend . . . I remember her as my g/f I called and had a great time talking to. Or the g/f I went to Brusters and made a fool out of myself in front of. Why can't I just move on? WHY!? Gah...  I guess we started talking and basically someone (no names) told her something happened between me and Melissa that didn't. I'm like wtf? Nothing more happened. But at the same time Kellie trusts this person with all her heart. Who am I to go against that? This whole event has really pissed me off.  I'm happy we talked. I'm sad that we got into that event again. I'm mad lies were told. How am I suppose to feel?! Then all I get is frustration when I talk to her, and that's not what I want!! I just want to sit down and be able to let this shit handle itself. I am almost positive that if me and Kellie talked like this never happened she would not only learn to trust me again, but I'm almost DAMN sure she'd like me again. But should I even like her still? What the hell is this?  Gah... I don't know what to do. I need to get my thoughts straight...  Why can't I just fall in love with the girl next door, take her to prom, get married too early, eat spagetti suppers for a year, and keep falling for her day in and out while we raise a family? I mean yeh I'm too young to be thinkin' about kids, but damn. I was raised in a house where love was some beautiful thing that will find you and hit you so hard you'll be on your ass. Have I felt love? Can I understand love? Should I even say the word at this level of comprehension?!  Sigh... I just wish I could focus on one thing like I used to. Back in the day I'd focus all my efforts towards one thing, one person... and my efforts would pay off. Now I put efforts in to get nothing back. Why can't I just get back SOME of what I put in? Gah... I'm going to sleep off this hell I've created in my mind.  If this is Kellie or Julia reading this... just don't... the thoughts in my head are so confused right now.... so... until tomorrow...  That is all.
