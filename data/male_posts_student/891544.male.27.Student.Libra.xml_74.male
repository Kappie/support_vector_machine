Someone needs to get Chris away from his work and make him have fun for a little bit this week.  mhmmm...  I'm not sure when Jeremy's shift starts (but maybe he'll read this and post it...if we're lucky).  But I definitely think pictures should be taken.  I wish I could be there.    Today, Tomorrow, Hump Day, Thursday, FRIDAY!!   I can't wait any longer.  P.S.  I killed my bro's gf with kindness last night and it was the best!  Just thought I'd add that in there.  ;)
