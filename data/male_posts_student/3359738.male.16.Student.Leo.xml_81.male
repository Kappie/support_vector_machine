I felt lonely. I felt I was the only human in the whole cinema not knowing what a kiss (on the lips) feels like, and I'm most certain I'm not wrong in that assumption. I look around and everyone's a couple. All but me.  I am tired of being alone, of not knowing what a kiss feels like, or even a passionate hug from your special other. (Sex too, but there's no rush for that.) In shorter words, I  have  loved I have not  been  loved (by a member of the opposite sex and similar age to me). I wanna experience the physical implications of this thing they call "love"; this drug; this mysterious force by which mankind runs on, seeks ...and eventually finds. This sometimes stupid, but essential emotion that makes life have a meaning; that makes it worthwhile. What is life? Why am I here? Why, why, WHY!!?! I'll tell you why. I was brought to this world as a product of this emotion which I seek. I think I'm here to change the world, even if it's just a little not much, just a little dent, it's still something. Often small things can make quite a difference, but I cannot live without this strange fuel I am lacking; the fuel that would give my life a purpose, a meaning, a reason to exist, a reason to  be .  And why is this not a suicide note? That's because I have not yet lost hope. I know out there there has to be  someone  for me. Some girl who would listen to me, care about me,  love me .  I seek love, and I swear to God I will find it. I am tired of being a fucking pussy. I am tired of being alone. I am somewhat hurt and tired of the world, but I will not lose hope, for one day I'll find love.  One day she'll be mine ,  whoever she may be.
