I like it when an author can make the characters so real that I find myself being happy with them, getting angry with them, or feeling 'real' emotions.  As if these characters were not just words on a page.  While reading a book recently, I found myself so angry with an event that happened and the way a particular character acted, that I had to put the book down and step back from it for a bit.  It was so real, it was actually able to evoke a strong emotional reaction.  That's good writing.  Because I enjoy reading so much, I have naturally thought of writing many times.  I always find excuses not to do it (until this blog, and that's if you consider this 'writing').  My typical excuses are along the lines of lack of time, creativity, or some other intangible thing.  I think perhaps the biggest thing holding my back is that I've read some incredible writing.  When I read these authors, I find myself thinking, "There's no way I could write like this".  I lack the descriptive skills, the vocabulary, the...craft.  Now, this may or may not be true, but I seem to have done a nice job convincing myself of it.  My best friend, a self-proclaimed author, tells me that I just need to write.  I just need to make the time to write.  Write short stories, novels, scenes, whatever...just write.   He's right, he's gotta be.  I'm sure the authors whom I adore didn't write their great works the first time they sat down and put the pen-to-paper, or fingers-to-keys as the case may be.  Writing, I assume, like everything else in life, takes practice to make better.  Maybe I should start practicing...maybe that's why I'm doing this.
