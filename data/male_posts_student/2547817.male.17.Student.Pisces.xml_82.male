The kind of thing where you JUST DO IT and not look back from there.  Today I scored full marks for my boat license theory test. Then, I spent the rest of the day at IMM with the bands. Oracion was so so but Jireh's was excellent. At least Crimson tide was good. Tight like nobody's business! Today really made me feel a lot better. After all the shit that's been happening.  ***************************************************************************** ***************************************************************************** ***************************************************************************** ***************************************************************************** ***************************************************************************** I walked out of the school almost in tears. Called Madam Ang and told her that I needed to go back to PJ. She arranged it for me and I was asked to make my way down. I explained my predicament to the principal and vice principal of PJ and they were willing to help me. Now what I have to do is get transferred from ACJC to PJC and it'll be set. I'll start again.  Leaving a lot of a great dream behind. You will never know what it feels like till you have an encounter of the first kind. Its hard to describe. I'm reluctant to leave it behind, but I know it's something I have to do now. My chances for leadership there are all but gone. Black marked in a prestigious institution. Man, that sucks man. Should I stay and fight? Is leadership everything? Is it true that the standards of education in ACJC are higher? Or is it up to the individual to determine his own destiny? Leading the AC choir would have been nice, but leading the PJ choir would definitely pose a much greater challenge. And that's what I wanted in the first place, so yeah. Do I really want to be on the same stage as the Pioneer choir? Would it be embarrassing? Will I finish my A levels with a great opportunity cost? These friend are a mere fraction of all the shit in my head now. Haha... Yet I can still find humor in that.  The Best Is Yet To Be.
