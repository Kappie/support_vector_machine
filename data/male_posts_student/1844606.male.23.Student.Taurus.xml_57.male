What I'm not looking forward to is finishing off this story.  And by finish off I mean write it.  We decided to head to downtown, to get far from the post-parade stampeed to cars to our favorite place.  Though it was essentially a hot dog stand situated inside the first floor of a converted teniment, the cobblestone street, small dimensions and quaint heart back shaped metal chairs gave it the feel of something European.  The gold leaf lettering of Left Bank situated between an oversized hot dog didn't hurt either.  The old man's smile was geniune whether it was your first trip in, or if he had seen you grow up before his eyes.  The kid in front of me ordered, and when he moved over to pay, began to dig frantically in his pockets for the extra few dollars.  He was a few bucks short.  I started to paw through my pockets hoping to find some change, but Mr. P cut everything short announcing, "Don't worry about it, just take it."  The sandy haired kid promised he'd come back in an hour with the rest of it, but again his offer was rebuffed with a simple "Just enjoy."  He moved off with his tray as Mr. P finished ringing up the sale, called out his characteristic "What can I do for ya?" and then had a glimmer of recognition and a smile came across his face "If it isn't Mr. Scott.  How are you my boy?"  Tangent:  He had an old school work ethic and charm to match.  I suppose it came from him owning the place and being around so long, no one could remember a time when he wasn't there.  He was around before fast food and even thought a health conciousness had cut into his business in the past few years, most people would agree it was his charm and cheese dogs that kept people coming back.  Busy days were few and far between in recent times, but on those rare occations when all the seats were filled, the most valued customers got to sit in the back room.  It was tough to imagen a space tinier than out front, the back managed to feel cozy but not clostrophobic with a myriad of family pictures decorating the walls.  Its here that I had met her.
