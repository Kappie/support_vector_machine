Also I have realized that my site looks like crap. I is way too bland, So look for a site remodeling here pretty soon. I will be trying to study some basic commands in something other than html (something easy too probably CSS if  urlLink Chad  will teach me).  If I do get around to editing my website it will probably be the same until about spring or later febuaryish. I dont know quite yet. Maybe I wont change it... I need to change some things on it a little first. The directory is terrible on it.  We will see...
