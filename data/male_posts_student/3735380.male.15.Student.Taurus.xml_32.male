My first and only roller coaster was the Blue Streak. The oldest roller coaster in the park. I almost destroyed my back on that one. That's why I hate wooden roller coasters.  Next thing we did was stand in line for the Magnum. The wait wasn't so bad. It was only an hour.  As soon as I looked at the slope of the Magnum, I chickened out and stepped out of the line. I hate zero-g. I'm afraid of heights. This park isn't made for the weak. I stepped out of line to get some lunch.  It amazes me how much fear my baby brother can take. He's 8 years old and by the looks of it, he doesn't have any sense of fear. He can watch the worst horror movies and not have nightmares, he can go on the Dragster and say it was a baby ride. Now  that's  freaky.  After that, we all went on water rides. That froze us in the hot sun.  Last thing we did was stand in line for the Millenium Force. I watched as the trains zoomed by us. I had a good feeling, and stood in line for two hours.  I looked at my sunburn. That was going to hurt. I wasn't white anymore, I was fluorescent-pink all over.  When I finally got to the front of the line, I felt a sudden unpleasantness in my stomach. I was freaking out. I wasn't shivering in the cold anymore, I was shivering in fear. I stepped out of line just before the next train came.  I'm such a coward. I'll never conquer my fear of heights and speed. Maybe not until next year. We'll come back, and when we do, I'll be ready.  We left the park. Funny thing though, as soon as we got onto the highway, we got a flat tire. A flat tire! We're stuck in the middle of nowhere, about 15 miles from home, and we have a flat tire. This is when my ingenuity came into play.  The Truth About OnStar  I asked my mom to press the OnStar button. We called them and told them we needed help. They said we needed to setup an account.  We went through about 20 minutes of registration. My mom couldn't read the Vehicle Identification Number, so I found a cell phone and used the light for that.  After about 25 minutes, they asked us to turn the car on and wait for a beep. That didn't work. They tried again.  "Our satellites might be failing. Try again tomorrow."  What is wrong with those people? We needed help! They disconnected us and left us on the highway with no tire change. Thanks a lot, OnStar.  We would have stayed there all night if it hadn't been for a tow truck that randomly came by. He wasn't affiliated with OnStar, he told us. Thank God he came by and helped us replace the tire. He warned us not to go anywhere over 60 mph, and we took off again. A lot of good OnStar did.  We all went home and went to bed. I had sunburn, so I was uncomfortable all night.
