Seriously, I have nothing of any value to say about law firm prestige.  A spam e-mail from Vault told me they'd released new law firm rankings, and some time spent with the free Vault access that Harvard's career services office has* didn't really help much.  I have no doubt that Vault is ranking >something why  But unlike college (or law school), not everyone leaves their first firm to get another job, especially not one in another law firm or legal-related endeavor, so I think the rankings probably must have less of an impact on what people should do when choosing, just because it really may not matter, and lifestyle/location/area of practice/all sorts of other factors are important, and can surely matter more than a firm's rank.  Like I promised, I've just said nothing of any real value.  From reading the Vault stuff, I've figured out that there a number of dimensions on which law firms seem to differ, and a number of dimensions on which they seem not to.  Dimensions on which they seem not to differ much: >Salary >Dress code Monday through Thursday >Lavish summer programs >Health insurance  Dimensions on which they seem to differ a bit: >Dress code on Friday >Dental and vision insurance >The existence of a subsidized cafeteria >Practice groups >"Face time" -- the mysterious concept that keeps you from leaving the office early if you have nothing to do; but I wonder if the existence of "face time" at some firms is exaggerated, and the lack of it at other firms is exaggerated as well.  I just don't know. >Internal staircase :)  This is not that helpful for making any sort of decisions.  Clearly.  And so the investigation continues.  * = I didn't realize I got free Vault access until three hours after I ordered the book online.  They wouldn't let me cancel my order.  I paid $35 plus $6 tax, shipping, and handing.  So if anyone wants the brand new, 744-page Vault top 100 law firm rankings book, in untouched condition, I'll sell it to you for $30 and save you a few bucks, and I won't charge you any shipping (or handling!), because I'm more comfortable eating $11 than eating $41, and figure someone out there *must* want the book.  So  urlLink e-mail me  if you want the book.  First one who e-mails me gets it, and I'll delete this little paragraph after I have a taker.
