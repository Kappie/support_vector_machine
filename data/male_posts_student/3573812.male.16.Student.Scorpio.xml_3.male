But I better go for fifth period to continue 'working' on my English essay (AKA write some more poetry).  I'm so f**kin lazy.  It kinda pisses me off.  It's not like I have anything to do.  I know, I'll watch Angel.  I have about three episodes on tape that I've yet to watch.  Ooooh, I think Willow's in one of them!  'I'm not who you think I am, I'm a lesser man than you could ever be'
