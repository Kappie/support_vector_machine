Anyway, how did so many of you see LotR already? Wasn't that that movie we were all gonna go see? Ah, well, I might just be hallucinating, I dunno, not important.  Well now, kiddies, the very happy holidays, as we're told they are, are comin' up, and aren't we all just so excited? We're really in that jeudo-christian, gift-giving, merry mood, now aren't we? That long and painfully amusing post, is an example of why Sedgewick (?) should post more often, and of the basic gist of all of our moods.  To help lighten things up around here, I know most of us, or at least some, are involved the ever popular p2p file-sharing trend, that's been around since about '97. So, we might get a little paranoid, a little worried, now and again. "Am I gonna get sued?", "Are they gonna get me if I download too much music/movies/pornography?", "Am I gonna wake up with a horsehead on my pillow and an RIAA member hanging over my bed, supoena in one hand, rectum-probing tool in the other?!"  Thankfully, unless you're into that kinda thing, these kinds of threats, may become just a distant memory.   urlLink An article on Zeropaid.com  recently reported a major blow to the bastards at the RIAA. While they might still be able to get to you, it has been ruled that obtaining the identities of file-sharers, particularly in the way the RIAA has tried to do, is a bit..wrong. They will not be allowed to directly obtain users' information from ISP's or from tracking programs as easily as they could before. In fact, they'll have to go thorugh a bunch of crap just to get to you, and then file a suit and etc, wasting a lot of money. Read the full story in the link provided.  So, for some of us, getting arrested will happen less, and for the rest, maybe not at all for the time being. Anyway, yeah those SAT II's were kinda crap, I only managed to complete the Biology one, leaving behind 16 Math IC questions due to the time, and f lil off my writing essay. Oh well, its not like it matters anyway.  I'm Deadinside, and THEY'RE WATCHING YOU!!  "Never be satisfied unless your on top, or....no...it's more satisfying if you're on to--NO!...uhhh..never be satisfied, until you get on top...to the top....um....DAMMIT!"
