We started talking and she knows my situation with my Dad, but didn't know about having to move as well.  She overheard Terry and I talking.  I told her I am working on my papers, but when I start working on one, the other pops into my head so I'm spinning.  She said, "Woah woah woah...Here's the deal: What paper do you want to be working on?"  I told her paper five (I need to do four, five, and now six).  She said, forgert paper six's deadline on Wednesday, you're on no timeline, just work on one paper, turn it in by the end of the quarter and work on paper seven when I give it out and turn it in with everyone else.  The other two papers you can turn into me after the quarter is over and I'll give you an "I" for a couple weeks.  "Does that help?"  I said, "Yeah, but I'm worried about the other..." and she interrupted me before I could finish.  She again stressed that I have too much to worry about and that life happens.  I almost started to cry.  Terry has been very helpful as well.  She's one of the ladies that hugged me the day I came back and she had tears in her eyes.  She's offered me her home if needs be.  She has a huge house on a lot of property and it's just her.  During my break I worked on an assignment for web design, thank God because it ended up being due at the beginning of the class.  We worked on something new in JavaScript and I actually got it done in class and it worked. :)  When classes got out I headed south to Seattle to help Mom with her new TV.  An employee at Fred Meyer's loaded it into her car and so I just helped unload it and set it up.  It's a really nice TV, the sound is great, and the picture is awesome.  The only problem is George W. Bush still looks like and sounds like an idiot.  I listened to his speech, not bad plan of action, but at a great expense.  As I have said from day one, I support the troops, but not the war or the man running it.  The thing that angers me most about this war, is him sending so many of the National Guard to Iraq.  That is NOT their job; they are to protect the State from other countries and even other State's invading.  138,000 US soldiers are in Iraq at every moment and the President said it will stay that way indefinately.    God, please protect our brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, other relatives, and friends serving in our military.  God also be with those who have family and friends in Iraq.  Amen.  After Grandma's and Mom's I went over to Joe and David's for dinner and watched "Mother Goose."  I was surprised that I liked it, but it was funny.  Joe made burgers, garlic thingys that are like asperagus, and rice.  For dessert we had ice cream and Tapioca pudding (home made).  Damn he spoils me!  This stress the last month has caused me to gain weight.  :(  Which adds more to my stress level. *sigh*  We had a pill flushing party before I left.  All my Dad's meds were at their house and we dumped them all in the toilet.  Wasn't good to keep them around anyway.  Earlier in the evening I went through a lot of his papers and threw a bag full away.  Still have a ton.  Joe gave me a Monster Engergy drink and I was on my way home.  It's 1 AM and I'm getting tired; I have another busy day tomorrow.  I want to get more homework done.  I'm hoping to get more than one paper done before the end of the quarter so I can actually relax between quarters.  She actually said I could do that, I don't have to work on it the week we're off.  I'm lucky to have the instructor I have for English.  I'm definately not going to take advantage of her generosity.  Anyway, I'm off to bed.  Have a great Tuesday!  -Jason  PS  For some strange reason Grandma this evening said to me, "How much is Dale selling his house for?"  I told her and she replied, "Oh, that's a bit too much."  I had a puzzled look on my face and said, "Um, why?"  She said, "I was going to buy it so you two could stay there."  I laughed and said, "No way!  If the property was owned, maybe."  Silly Grandma.
