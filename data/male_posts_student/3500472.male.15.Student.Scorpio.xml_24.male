ANYWHOWAYS!!!!  today after school ian and i practiced "times like these" for the popsconcert with the mics and everything, and it sucked so bad....my bass was completely out of tune and ians strumming was kind of off so i kept screwing up on when to come in and stuff, but besides all that, people said my voice was great. also, i just got done with Jessicas graduation shirt. i made one for myself to (cuz im selfish like that =P) so im going to wear that for my song, and maybe do somehting else...no one knows but me...and God...yup, well im not ashamed when i say this, but i broke down this morning. i was talking with caitlin and she told me some good news about her and Dan, ad then she asked whats on my mind and so i told her some of the things that i feel about graduation and Jessica leaving and stuff, and right after i said "i can see it in her that she wants to leave but i dont want her togo at al." i broke down...thanks for comforting me cait-e-poo. but. i think i needed a break down like that, cuz ive been holding it in for way to long. my mommy said im a romantic...yay...also, i didnt get to finish my math exam cuz my choir director pulled me and the other bass aside so we could practice and she kept us for like 15 minutes after the bell rang so i was late to the exam and i had 17 problems left...there were only 66 problems on the exam, and it was really hard too, soi most likely failed that exam (again) yup, well thats all the excitement in my life for today, so ill do this some other time. im gonna go work on her video diary thingy soon. ok? bye all
