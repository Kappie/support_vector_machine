So yeah one of my best friends is getting jaw surgery(bad) but gets to skip exams to do so(good). So today we had a little shindig to wish her well. I got my tickle on if I do say so myself. We watched some Samurai Jack cause we're uber-cool. After that I started reading Fight Club because its a kick ass wicked movie and I wanted to see the book it was noveled after. 1 week until I have blue hair. It's gonna rock my socks off. Ooh and Anthony Kiedis is releasing his autobiography soon. That'll be a gem to read. So today had a rocking swing to it. Bye my non-existent as of yet readers. -Happy Gavin
