I felt an attraction to that poem. It is so meaningful. The everlasting quest for love. The hope. The wish. Ahh...the beginning stages of love. This is written by an anonymous author. Enjoy.     Imagine Love...Wish For It.     I could only imagine, The love between us. I can only wish, For the love between us.  Every time I close my eyes, I see the two of us. We make such a perfect couple. Alas, I could only imagine.  I can only dream, Of touching your face.  Smooth, thin, papery. Your eyes emitting love.  I can only wish, That you can respond, To every of my intimate moves, And fall in love with me.  Your strong, willful character, Leaves marks of awe within me. Your care and concern, Gives me boundless of joys.  Even though I know, That I canâ€™t have you, I would like to try, And try, and try.  I could only imagine,  That you know what I am saying. I wish you could, I hope you can.   -Anonymous
