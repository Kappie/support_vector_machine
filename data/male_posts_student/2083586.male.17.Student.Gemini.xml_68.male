Well as afr as stuff goes i can't complain, although i haven't as of yet found a band, aside from the one with jeff. (don't get me wrong, i will love the band with jeff and kc, but i would also like to get involved in a band that might play some of the qotsa songs im interested in).  no gf as of yet, although there are some really good prospects, idk if im all that interested in having another gf for while, or atleast til after prom. i know some way im going to get tricked into going...damnit.  that's really about it i guess, im kinda bored.  -mike
