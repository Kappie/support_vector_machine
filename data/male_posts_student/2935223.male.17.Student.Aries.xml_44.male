Maybe because It's the start of Spring Break and you all have lives and are doing things....meanwhile I sit at home....waiting for tonight...YAY!! I'm goin' to see the movie tonight...I wonder if it's still Starsky and Hutch...I dunno...but....I'm gonna be there, because I was invited by Keli, and I don't want to let her down.  I'm so sappy. Ya, so, if you haven't actually figured it out by now, Keli is the person I like, I mean, she's just so neat and cute....and not to mention fuckin' hott!   Ya, so....I'm pretty much stuck going to prom....even though I don't want to really, and didn't in the first place....but.....that's ok....I just gotta go and have fun. I don't know what to talk about right now.....uh......yup, that pretty much covers it.... Peace!  Spense
