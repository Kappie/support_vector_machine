I also need to figure out how to put links on the sidebar. html is like un-ripe fruit, beautiful in sentimation, yet course and crunchy in reformation and consumation. I think that analogy can be applied to many things in life.  i am again in my history class, doing absolutly nothing. Mr. Williamson thought it would be funny to come to school naked today as a joke, so i am trying my best to focus on the computer screen rather than his huge [EGO].  In all my long 366 years, i have learned that people like to read about themselves. So every update from here on out... i will say something about a person at the end of every post.   Mike Schmiess - smooth to the touch, yet a lion at heart. Mike can be compared to a festering kiwi: round, brown, with little green hairs on the wrinkled surface. on a scale of one million i give mike a "pais."  current role model: Houghton Mifflin current roll cake: mint chip
