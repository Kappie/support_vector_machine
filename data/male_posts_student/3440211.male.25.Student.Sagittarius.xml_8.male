It was weird dealing with that in Paralel with the unamable. very weird. I have taken steps to improve the situation the anger is still there and that is not good at all. Not good at all.  Hopefully the visit to the laundry tonight will ease my nerves. Normally the purgatory, as I call it, has the inverse effect but you never know.  I just wish the unspeakable was non existent. But I guess life can not be perfect.  State: Up the wall but some steam was let go.
