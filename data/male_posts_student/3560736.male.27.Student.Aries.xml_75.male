I almost didn't link to it, but then it is just so amazing that I didn't think people would believe it if they didn't see it. It is a shining example of how far some people will go to push an agenda.  UPDATE: Here's an  urlLink asinine quote  from a seriously fractured mind. You have to read it to behold the sheer stupidity of it. Honestly, It's unbelievable.
