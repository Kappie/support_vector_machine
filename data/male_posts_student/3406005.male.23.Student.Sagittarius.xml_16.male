She responded with the following:   I won't mention you name but ... : It is so refreshing to see a right-winger read lefty stuff. I must say if you knew me you'd know I don't drink lattes. And I'm not entirely sure what you mean by "ND types." I happen to believe in people. I picked the party that believes in and sticks up for people. I'm not any "type." I'm just Melanee.   Thanks for having the gumption to put your name to your comments. That I really appreciate. ;)   Ms. Thomas receieved roughly 9% of the popular vote in Lethbridge constituency which, I gather, is fairly respectable for an ND in southern Alberta. One of the Liberals' star candidates, former Alberta Liberal leader Ken Nicol, fizzled in this riding (much like red giant Glen Murray in Winnipeg). Not that Nicol was cursing Melanee's name for splitting the left-wing vote; the Conservative candidate won 62% of the popular vote [Today, Crowfoot MLA Kevin Sorenson was reported as sniffing, "ONLY 62%?"]. Lets just say Stephen Harper did not periodically pipe up with a nervous "Whats happening in LETHBRIDGE?" last night while the results were coming in.   Ms. Thomas also seems fairly pleasant, which leaves one to wonder why it is she's associated with the party she is.
