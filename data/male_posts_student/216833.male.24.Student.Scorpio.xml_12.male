I am really sick of that cat.  I love her, but damn, that is just nasty, she doesn't know.  i think her litter box needs fresh litter. I guess whatever.  We are going to longview tonight to play at the Texas Blues Bar.  I'm stoked about it...first show with brian as our drummer. Hope it goes well. I wont be back until Sunday night.
