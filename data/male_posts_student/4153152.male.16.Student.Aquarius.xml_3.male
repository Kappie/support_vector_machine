I don't want to give away too much, but scenes like NYC freezing from the top down and the massive hail in Japan are simply amazing. There is only one conclusion: go see The Day After Tomorrow.  I'm not going to do an overview or a synapsis because I don't want to give anything away. It's an excellent movie and I don't want to spoil anything about it. I went with a friend, and before we went outside, we were both thinking it was going to be cold. I thought: "Damn I wish I would have brought my jacket. Going to have to run to the car." It was a  completely  unconsious thing. I honestly and completely believed that it was going to be cold out. I think that speaks for itself. Go   See   This   Movie.
