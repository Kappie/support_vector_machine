Ideally I could use the google toolbar or another application to sync these links up with the favorites in Internet Explorer.  I vision a dropdown taskpane on the left similar to labels where I could organize my favorites.  But this feature request is a two parter. I would also like the ability to quickly add a link when I search using google or come across a link within a conservation.  I foresee next to results where it says "view cache" it could also say "add favorite".  That would be nice,
