What would we find out from them?  Something we didn't want to know  Or that we are "sexy and trim?"    What about the people at work?  Their thoughts about that guy Bob?  See what our bosses thought  Could we get a better job?    What about our family?  What would they have to say?  What do they really think  About our work and our play      Alright this one really needs some work... a couple rhymes are kind of forced and just doesn't flow really well... so more work.
