In the evening I went to eat with a couple people at Applebee’s.  The more times I come back to this theatre, the more I realize that the people here are kind of like my extended family.  These people that work here aren’t JUST my co-workers and supervisors and bosses, but they are my friends, too.  And, I think that people look forward to me coming back as much as I look forward to being back.  I know someday that I’ll have to venture out and work other places, too.  But I’d definitely like to think that I’ll always have a home here, at least as long as the current people are in charge are here.   11:55pm  Tonight’s show went well.  We had a “first act” pre-show entertainment mini-stravaganza, where a few people sang Christmas songs and then a group of us did a small sketch and then performed a song and dance.  The song was Bruce Springsteen’s version of “Santa Clause is Comin’ to Town”… it was great fun.  People in the audience seemed to enjoy the cheesy background dancing and the overall package of the song.  For tonight, my seven and a half minutes are gone… tomorrow is another day, and then, unfortunately, I’ll go back to being one of the unseen, unsung heroes of theatre.  I just wish…
