At least this module is much more interesting and therefore easier to adsorb.   It was an interesting weekend I had, firstly I was quite happy to get over and done with my test on Sat, however the mood to celebrate was lost in the reality that I didn't have anywhere and anyone to celebrate with. It's rare that I get impulsive urges to...well enjoy a night on the town, usually I'm content with simple (and less expensive) pleasures. Therefore is was sad to see the feeling go to waste.  I was helping a friend out over the weekend as well, she was looking for tenants for a place she was renting out in  Melbourne  and inquired if I knew anyone who would be needing a place since this is the period that a lot of overseas students would be going over to start their studies. It was kinda last minute but I did know of some that fit the bill. So I helped to link them up. Perfect example of the type of  Networking  that is so heavily touted as the new  road to success, business or otherwise. For this reason that I quite regret not having closer links with my old classmates. As I think back I don't know why I didn't try harder to keep in touch. Even those as late as my Poly friends, I am in contact with a bare handful. Think I need to start to keep closer links, I mean thats one of the reasons why I carry a PDA, so I won't lose contact information. You never know when knowing someone would come in handy. Especially the likes of doctors, lawyers, computer and automobile technicians, journalist, real estate agents and a whole range of support industry types.  In light of this then, that it was a welcomed surprise that I bumped into an old primary school classmate of mine in church. I had found her familiar at first but  didn't think too much into it at the time, and neither did she, but after listening to my ah...unique manner of speaking, she deduced my identity. It was great catching up with old times, I have nothing but fond memories of my time at Tao Nan and she shared the same sentiments. We were both eager to hear more of what became of our classmates and while she was still in contact with some of them, I had to disappoint her with my lack of knowledge about the others. We did agree however that we should try to round up as many of the ones that we did know and have a reunion of sorts. Well heres a shout out to  SuLynn . Hope to see you next week. We can trade more stories :)  My time's up...back to the books I go.
