I know i was suppose to get one in healthsmart, like, i KNOW i can get it, but i'm not gonna work there. turns out the people that are going to college also included Claudia....so yeah, definitly not gonna work there.  Did i mention she knows like my WHOLE family? it's fucking crazy, i know.  Like, i think she's had a conversation with all member of my immidiate family.  What my parents, AND her forgot to mention is taht i think 2 of the 4 times, i think she was with her b/f...which completely recks any intentions flowing in my mind.  Ya, my parents love her, they think she's great...BUT, she;s untouchable. so yeah, sucks for me...what i'm i gonna do? cry about it in my blog? (......). So yeah, today i ask Shawna if they're hireing over there in Banna Republic over there in Mount Kisco...she said prolly, and asked if she wanted an application..i was like  YEA BABY!!!  But, then i ALSO realized that it was an all women's store....at first, i thought the immediate "shit, i'm not gonna work there"...but with the help of Brian Wolff, i saw the light...and advantages to working there....thats like working at Armani Exchange if your gay.  But yeah, so i'll see how that goes, prolyl won't go through, but what the hell.  Found my wallet today...well, I didn't, but Jones did...in his couch, where i thought it was....so yeah, thats pretty awsome.  Still had about 12 bucks in there... and my permit, which permits me to drive.....YI PEE!!!  on the subject of wallets....i took my 5 hour yesterday.....now THAT shit is booring.  jorge and Andy came along, so that made it MADD funny.  We got many inside jokes from it, and it was juss an overall good experince.  We acutally ended up staying there for 3 hours, but it felt like 7....lol, hey, 7-3 is 5!.......wait, wtf?  So yeah, can;t wait to drive, but i have to dish out like 365 buvks for the  required  20 hours i have to do.  PLUS, on top of that, i also gotta wait till my dad get's back from ecuador, which should be a week after he leaves, but prolly longer than that.  And cause andy geet;s his car, and Jorge might be getting one, that means the three of us will be the only ones in the school to have Mercedes Benz's.  o yeah....i know your jealous......MUHAHAHAHA  Prom aparently is coming up MADDDDDDD soon, and i totally forgot about.  It dosn't bother me though, i prolly wasn;t gonna go anyway, but it;s the fact that NO ONE asked me....i guess i can;t complain, but i was expecting atleast someone to remind me or something....it's ok though.....next year is going to be the best.....senior prank anyone? hehehehehehhehehee....  I'm going to da movies tonight with rob...we gonna see secret window.  Dun't know who's coming though.  Alot of the guys wanted to go to see this play this kid DAn from antioch is in.  Apperently a good amount of people from antioch are gonna be there, including jorge's girl which will, in part, make him go too.  So yeah.  I  was  gonna go, but than i realized....first) dunt know him too goo second) i wouldn;t like it anyway and third)i hate pina coladas (....)  so yea, but hope them people have fun or what not.  Drove home today, dropped the guys off....i think they were kinda scared, but they still went through it....mad funny   i had a awsome dream last night.  I was, like, doing shit right, and then, there were these two chicks, and i think this other guy ws in the dream to right.  Then all of a sudden i start getting head from this chick, and then i look up, and this guy is getting head too, so my brain triggers the "no co-star" mechanism and then, i'm getting heads from two chicks.....it was soo damn awsome.....i love raviolli.  I realized that i eat alot of wendys, AND subway...whoa  Dispatch is an awsome band, and also, get Lenny Williams - 'Cause i Love you...good song too, funny, but cool  ok, so yeah, i got nothing else to say...hope this entertained you for more than 2 seconds, come back tomarrow when i discuss the smiliarities between aqua man and John Kerry.
