That quote taken from the one and only Calvin Chan when we went bowling along with the rest of the HYPE kids and also my two cousins Anthony and Jonny. It was an awesome time, pure jokes and chillin' haha. Today was one of the more energy-pumped days I guess you can say, with basically my whole night taken up at Fleetway tearin' up the lanes....with bowling balls. It was a nice way to end my day, beginning with stupid power repairs *meaning my power was going on and off* and also my volunteer interview at the Library. My whole day wasn't that bad though, in fact was probably the best day of this week haha.  My day started off at about 11pm. My clock was off, since the power was down since 9am, so I just picked up my cell phone to check out the time. Mom was goin' out somewhere, so I sat home alone for a bit. At first I was skeptical of what I was to do with no power, since it seems like my life sorta revolves around electricity now, but I finally realized something out of the blue....  This was the perfect time to do devos. So I spent some time then reading up on my PDL and then the Bible, and just reflected on them I guess. I read a lot on how each of us may have different talents, but God uses each and every one of them in his own way, and we all form one Spiritual Family. The Bible uses the metaphor of a human body, and how every part of your body isn't the same and has different functions. For example, the nose is used for smell and ears to hear. Without the ears you can't hear, or without the nose you can't smell. Same as the Spiritual Body....each of us have different talents for different things. I also read about the always said "treat others as you want them to treat you," and also how if everyone treated everyone with love, how we wouldn't have many of the problems in this world. It kinda sucks when you think about it how people sometimes just don't see that and how beef starts, and then eventually that beef can turn into....well you know whatever else bad can emerge out of it.  Well after doing devos, I headed downstairs to drum around for a bit. Sat on compy for a bit then, and decided to play SC with Gavin and whoever else was online at the time. I suck with Zerg, and when I was actually doing good....the power went out AGAIN. So then I scrapped SC, since it was already 2, and then I got ready for my interview.  Interview wasn't so bad today. Had to do some WHMIS quiz to know all the hazard signs and stuff it was pretty easy. Then just got asked a few questions. I'm probably gonna be a compy geek at library...or gardener. Dunno if I got position yet but I gotta do training Friday at Masonville Library.  And afterwards, sat around for a bit before Jason came. Then we headed to Fleetway.  I'm too lazy to blog the rest, but yeah basically the night was filled with lots of jokes, memories, and of course our farewells to Steph as she's leavin' for HK tomorrow...and not coming back for a month and a half =(.    We'll all miss you Steph...have fun in HK!   Anyways I'm out...plus I'm just too lazy to blog right now haha.  Later people.
