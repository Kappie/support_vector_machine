Today was THE busiest day I've ever had, and on top of all that, I had to stay over.  We had some kinda high powered corporate execs come in to the store.  Something about some new kinda coffee.  Because of that, everything had to be perfect.  On top of that, the business made it an interesting day.  I messed something up pretty well, but I had a pretty nice recovery (I think anyways).  I had this one lady come through and she asked for a small drink.  Well, after I had totaled her order, she asked if I had counted that as a senior drink.  The lady didn't look old at all, but I figured, "Hey the customer's always right."  I apologized and said that I got confused because she didn't look a day over 16.  She kinda laughed and I guess I had one of those customer appreciation moments where they get that comfortable feeling that makes them want to come back later because of the friendly service.  IDK, maybe I read into that a little too much; we'll just have to see if I see her again.  I went in depth into the exciting and busy busy busy world of a runner.  They're the ones who take the food to the people.  I wasn't very good at it at first, but I picked it up kinda quickly I think.  I'm obviously not perfect yet, but I'm not bad.  It's kinda weird, almost every time I see Hortencia, she looks at me and smiles and it's some weird/goofy/cute kinda smile that makes me cheese.  IDK, it's hard to explain.  Anyways, because I ran I saw her quite a bit today.  I also had the excellent pleasure of talking quite a bit with Claudia and Veery (I have no idea how to spell her name).  Veery is another hispanic, but she's pretty funny.  Claudia is just hilarious; so between the two of them I was laughing pretty much the whole time.  After I got back from work I started immediately on Bre's CD's cause I have to get them done tomorrow.  But while they are d/ling (down loading) I started reading some of my friends blogs.  They're all miserable!  It makes me feel bad because I can't do anything to make them feel any better.  Ashley (thanks for reading ;)) is having all kinds of family problems and future crisises, and Jeremiah (thanks for being such a dedicated friend a reader) is lonely and hurt because he can't see how much people do appreciate him.  I'm all sucked up in my work that I can't do much at all besides work, get chores done, and pray.  Not only that, but I haven't heard from Colleen in a couple of days.  I have no clue how she's doing.  I just wish there were more hours in the day so I could do all the things I want to do and all the things I need to do and on top of that, sleep 9-10 hrs a night.  If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman? (not that you ever called me superman in the first place..... nvm, lol)  BTW, I want to give a special holler out to Brit...(tany?).  Perhaps I've seen you as well.  I don't have a link to your blog to return the compliment so I'll just say thank you.  BTW, I'll see if I can look for you when we go to your jambouree sometime in August or early September.  All that said, I'm signin out.  Holla back all my party peoples (those of you who are less lively are also invited to post as well ;) ).
