Without much of an exposition, I've been listening to "new upcoming artists" and when they do up and come, it somehow becomes very unlikeable. This in itself has no hypocrisy, but it's the fact that I'll rave about them, comparing them to other bands that are very similar and professing that "my" new band is so much better when they really aren't. The worst part is when they become mainstream and I detach all ties I had to them before and rant about how bad they really were. For example, take the band Franz Ferdinand, a European band (what a surprise) and I found out about them before they became (and still are becoming) popular. Credit to NME (http://www.nme.com/) for the pre-warning about Franz Ferdinand. I loved them for a couple weeks and now I hate them mostly because I saw their video on MTV and my lame and unfashionable MTV nerd chemistry partner asked me about a song,  Take Me Out , and if I knew who sang it, it was Franz Ferdinand but I just closed my eyes and just turned away. This has happened for quite some time and will until I stop looking for those up and coming artists. There's something about knowing about a good band before they reach the masses, you get a sense of proudness, but the thing is, nobody cares about who knew about them first. There is no distinctive line between good bands and really good bands, when you look at just the guitar riffs or the singer's pitch, everything else isn't considered. I have rules about dating, that there pretty much are no rules, if she's cool, she's cool. At the moment, I'm taken and I'm extremely happy with whom I'm with but with music, I don't have a mate. If the music is good, it's good, I just don't want to end up considering Britney Spears as good music. I guess the hypocrisy lies in the fact that I try so hard to be the opposite of people who oppose everything that I've become an "anti" too. If you've ever seen  SLC Punk , you'll realize that all of this is very similar. By the way, sorry about the complaining, I've tried to avoid bitching ever since I left LiveJournal (http://www.livejournal.com/) since that's all that seems to be on there, people bitching about their horrible american lives, but I wrote this to use myself as an example as there are many others in the same situation that don't even know it yet.  I've come to the conclusion that all fifteen year olds love the movie  SLC Punk . What a waste. As proof, view my profile, click on the link "SLC Punk" and just look at how old all of the bloggers are who like the movie too. Besides, aren't they too young to watch it anyway?
