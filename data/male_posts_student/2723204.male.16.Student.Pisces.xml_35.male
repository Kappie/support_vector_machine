Your Existing Situation   Sensitive; needs esthetic surroundings, or an equally sensitive and understanding partner with whom to share a warm intimacy.    Your Stress Sources   Wishes to be independent, unhampered, and free from any limitation or restriction, other than those which he imposes of himself or by his own choice and decision.    Your Restrained Characteristics   Willing to participate and to allow himself to become involved, but tries to fend off conflict and disturbance in order to reduce tension. Feels that he is burdened with more than his fair share of problems. However, he sticks to his goals and tries to overcome his difficulties by being flexible and accommodating.  Egocentric and therefore quick to take offense. Able to achieve satisfaction through sexual activity but tends to hold aloof emotionally.      Your Desired Objective  Strives for a life rich in activity and experience, and for a close bond offering sexual and emotional fulfillment.    Your Actual Problem  Fights against restriction or limitation, and insists on developing freely as a result of his own efforts.
