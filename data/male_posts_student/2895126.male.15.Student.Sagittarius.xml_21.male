I had to do this all by HTML, so you may be impressed.  *Waits for people to take in the cool effects*  OK, today I'm posting a quiz:   urlLink What Kind of CEO Would You Be?     Would you be just a high-powered CEO or an unethical SOB?  Based on my results, I could go either way. I might benefit from taking to heart the advice in Belief.net's Everyday Ethics columns.  I scored 13 on a scale of 1-50, pretty close to "honest."   A great flame follows a little spark.   (Dante Alighieri)
