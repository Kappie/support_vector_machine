'maggi mee' was ok but......hmm......sometimes she wear too much make up, hah......i prefer gals with natural looks. then went for lunch with yvonne, ate nasi goreng and i didnt finish it....then yvonne wans to treat me but i insist on paying back and i did.   today, 2 ppl approach me and talk to me, 1st one is a guy, asked me wat i am using for my programs. then the other one, tat gal on the lift......she asked me 'where am i' now for my assignment. guess i have to skip a lot of the assignment requirements..imagine 10 days and we have to do the codes, test and reports......how can?!  saw nicole online......days before, she msg me on icq and as usual, those things again. sometimes i really wonders if she really knew who she is talking to..... yeah, she is someone who can change fast....... i am scared of these kind of gals........... hmm..... hmmm...................sleep now...........
