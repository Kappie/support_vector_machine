So Momma makes me buy chicken for everyone so we can have enough food... since these two have bottomless pits for stomachs (hope I spelled that right.) So we ate and snacked and played the games we rented for hours and hours.... damn. It really does get exhausting after a while. Well, everything's kewl now. Ave's comin home tomorrow, I get to go over to Johnny's house tomorrow as well. Blub, Ima go.
