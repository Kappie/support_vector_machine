MAN im crying rite now...no not really but i would if i could..or if   i   wanted to??? i dont know it just seems to me that a lotta people rite now are doing that sort of thing...but o well... its high school...so i guess all that this blog really means is, is that im single and im lovin' it.........well not really lovin it but not hatin ya know...cuz there are definitely too many hatas' in this world...i think every one will agree with me on that one...but ya i just need someone to TURN UP THE HEAT!...or something...OR FREEZE ME...nothing in between...dont want that lukewarm stuff...ya...but i guess thats upo to GOD...and well....thats fine...
