My list of bygone friends is far too long and one day I may have to take up a quest of relocation and reaquaintence.  Now let's say that after 5 years or 10 even really nothing's changed and two people have nothing to share short of the movies they'd seen lately and re-hash tales of auld.  Would that be a shame?  From where does this cyclic notion come?  Progress?  Sucess?  What are these things really?  As I sip my fruit punch cool-aid stare at the cursed birds on my balcony, I remember the good times and I smile.
