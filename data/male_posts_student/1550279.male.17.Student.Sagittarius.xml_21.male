We had a huge thunderstorm cell come straight through the Dallas area last night (while I was out seeing  Miss Saigon ) which knocked out our power until 4:00 this afternoon.  2 days of summer school down, and the class is turing out to be fairly entertaining. Our teacher makes lots of jokes and tells us stories, so it doesn't seem like we're really there for 5 hours and 15 minutes. We start giving our first speeches tomorrow, though, but hopefully this trend will hold...
