Since I am just a studnet who is NOT majoring in curlinary,  the blogs I will write are going to be very simple, not technical.  I'm just a food enthusiast.  I have kept pics of my dinner  for a while. Today, as the first picture of this blog, I post a pic of  Oyako-don .  " Oyako " means that parents and kids in Japanese. In this meal, " Oyako"  means chiken as parents and eggs as children. " don " stands for "don buri", which originally means the bowl. But nowadays, it means a rice bowl, meal on rice. For example, a beef bowl served at "Yoshino-ya", a chain beef bowl restaurant is called "Gyu- don " in Japanese.  The Oyako-don I cooked looks like too much ingridients. If you go to japanese restaurant, a much more simple Oyako-don will served.  I just put more vegetables that have no strong flavor not to change original taste of Oyako-don. It looks good, huh?     urlLink    Oyako-don  urlLink
