And also, the "n-word" was used back then, and it was the common word for black people.  Making all the poor white people of the south talk in a more socially polite way would have been defeating a major point of the book, realism.  100 years from now, what if "black" is not politically correct?  Will they ban all the books written in present day, to censor "bad words"?  These people make me so mad!!!
