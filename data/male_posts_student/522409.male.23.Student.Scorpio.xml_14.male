The boys of summer are playing over-.700 ball, which is, simply put, in-freakin'-credible.  Pedro is a beast.  D-Lowe is a beast.  Burkett is a beast.  Our top 3 are a combined 19-1.  Derek Lowe hasn't given up a home run in about 80 innings.  Is there anyone in the majors whom the Red Sox can't beat?  No.  Save themselves.  This season is very much in their hands.  They're off to their second-best start in history and the Yanks are still trailing but a paltry 2 games.  Granted, we can bring that to 5 games   if we sweep the series.    7-4 without Manny, who'll be back in 2-4 weeks.  When he was injured, he was the league's top hitter and RBI man.  One can only conjecture what his return will bring to the team, who is already destroying the field in the majors.  I'm crossing my fingers.    It's a beautiful day and at the end of it, I'm moving to the Cape.  I'm not sure it could be more perfect if it tried.  Summer #2 with the Hyannis Sound.  Game on.
