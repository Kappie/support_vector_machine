The mind is constantly wanting, Wanting for a companion by its side... The eyes are always seeing Seeing but with secrets to hide.. The lips are constantly needing, Needing a cause to grin and smile wide.. But it is not beyond but within our own mind, That happiness flows and forms a tide.. A bird of joy within your heart, a friend by your side, Look in the mirror and see it through your eyes--in yourself, God's special Child."    Tejas
