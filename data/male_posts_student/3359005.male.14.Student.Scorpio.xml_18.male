We had to walk 1 hour in and out of the area we were supposed to go to and it was all counted for our CIP hours. How nice is that? I calculated a total work time of 1.5 hours, and it is clocked at 6 hours. Not that I'm complaining, but wouldn't it be better if we walked into an office to do 6 hours of proper community work? Then again, the Physical Education  Aesthetics department has never been known for their efficiency... It was really more fun than work, especially with the antics of the dynamic trio we know as our class teachers!  Mrs Toh was dressed much more formally than she would in class, but maybe it's because she wears clothes that look like a house elf's rag to class. With her age catching up on her, you wouldn't be expecting her to bend down to pick up weeds would you? Very surprisingly, she was actually sppeding up the hill to go weeding. Maybe the biologically enhanced foods have something to do with it. When she actually started weeding, it looked like she was tending to her garden. Staying in one spot, it was as if she was looking after her plot of flowers. When we were done, she beamed at us and told us the huge pile in the middle of the path was her's. Halfway done the hill, she actually started running, as in really running. " To the aircon!" she yelled as our incredulous faces looked up at her.  Mr Sham kind of thought he was Tarazan... He was looking for all the vines hanging on trees and tried to swing on them. He really showed a wild side of himself when he joined in the tug-of-war with the tree. Actually, I thought he lowered himself to my class' level of intelligence, which is not at all very high. But I tell you something... He actually has a car! I mean, it was pretty shocking to see a Malay teacher have a car, but his car wasn't even the typical Malay second hand car, it was a nice, middle-class car. Well... Call me racist, but Malays are never known to be rich are they?  Deven was the most embarassing thing ever. He was trying overly hard to be funny, incorporating his little bit of Physics into a weed pulling activity. He was being blatantly ridiculed by Ashok and Anjan, but I have a feeling he really didn't know it. When I told him in his accent to "apply the force" on the weed, he threatened to "apply the force on your face!" I guess I don;t look Indian enough... Or maybe my imitation was too good. After we went back to home ground to retrieve our bags, Ashok caught a caterpillar meant to scare Mr Sham. Mr Sham managed to a certain extent hide his fear, but when Deven saw it he was totally mortified. He was saved by the ranger asking Ashok to put it back, and later gave the lame excuse of it having the possibility of being poisonous.
