I discovered that my email invitations to my keg thing last weekend didn't make it to the hotmail addresses due to the stupidity of cox.net, I got a 0 on part 1b of my Soc Sci 3a assignment, and my grandmother died.  If I end up going to my grandmother's funeral in Taiwan, then I might be missing that free Unwritten Law show. Lose money from working, and set my research back a bit.  I also had to track down resources on the movie  Blockade  (1938). It looks like I'm going to be focusing my research on  Blockade  rather than lots of different movies due to the fact that I'm limited on time for this assignment... I have aproximately 3 weeks to get a solid draft done and research wise... I have maybe 15% of the necessary research done to do a 15-20 page paper.  Playing right now is  Bad Religion 's "Along the Way" from their  80-85  compilation. It's a nice punk rock funeral march.  ***
