(I don’t have too many wants) I’m worried about her. She’s always been there for me. She was an angel and she will always be my guardian angel. I wonder how she is going to get on with her life. I cant help her even if i wanted to, its really frustrating!   To make matters worse, still, no sign of C. As much as I want to contact her, I’m trying not to. I guess it’s gonna end up like dawn. She won’t keep in touch and well I’ll just bear the brunt and live on. I never was worth much to anyone. Why must things never for once go my way?  Been thinking of going back home, least I’d be there at home for mum. All my life all what I’ve wanted was some one to love me. lol I guess that’s what a lotta people want. I always though that she’d be the one.   Why is it, that all we guys have this concept of some one who’d save us from ourselves? I dunno. I guess it will all be over now in a few more days, I’ll be back where I started. Alone and unloved, except by mum. Then again aren’t mums and dads supposed to love you, no matter how you are?   Mums 59, I guess it’s better to go home and stay with her rather than staying here alone. That way even though I may not be happy, at least mum will be. Maybe a death to all the things that I want to do and the things I want to see. [Shrug] That’s what life is about, sacrifices and choices.   I have another interview on Monday; I don’t really give a damn about it now. Life doesn’t seem to matter anymore. I did a while ago when I had some one to work for. With every passing day things get harder. Try living your life in loneliness, its not that I choose to be this way. Things happen and at the end of the day I end up being alone. I do know there are a lot more important things besides me, Im not going to raise my hands and say …” but what can I do?” How can I help some one if I can’t help myself?   Whooshes gotta new guy. I’m happy for her. They are making long term plans. She’s another person who’s living her life to the max. The good old American dream. I dared to dream once; it got shot down before it even grew wings. Dave’s on the roll with his new job. I hope he sticks to this one and the politics doesn’t get to him.   I made peace with Lisa the other day. So things are better at home. Not that I like her , just that if I can hurt one less person I might as well do .As dad always says “what are you going to gain my making enemies when you are going to leave, might as well part as friends.”  I still haven’t been able to find any accommodation for the last 1 month here .I don’t know what to do, I don’t have just enough money to get through. Why do i miss her, at least it not the hurt and miss feeling (not yet). I just can’t stop thinking about her. How’s it all gonna end I don’t know. Will I end up alone, stuck at home still living with my folks? Will be able to travel around the world with C or with a bunch of friends? Will I be able to road trip? I'm not asking much am I.   Take me down to the roads again  To the lonely interstates and skies,  And all I ask is a big bike and a map to steer me by   Another Friday night passes by , lonely as I stand. All days seem alike. It was her who made a difference. I actually wanted to do so much for her, i would have, I still do. A man without hope that’s what I’ve become. I'll move on, these things won’t hurt me anymore (I won’t have anymore of these kind of feelings ever)    I’m glad that Angel's kitten is ok. Least she will have some one when she goes offline. Weird isn’t it how little things can make u smile. I’m sitting here smiling at a little kit that I haven’t seen who’s making Angel smile.    As you get to know people you begin to wonder how alike they all are with respect to you. It’s like u see splinters of you in their woodwork   Friend's don’t just get up and go away.
