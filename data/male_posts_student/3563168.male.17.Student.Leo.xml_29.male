Wouldn't it be easier to write down the title of the song and how it makes you feel as opposed to copying the whole lyrics down? I know there would be more of a purpose to that.     It's even worse when the words don't rhyme. Then you're just reading a half-ass story about some song writer with lots of mean words. Almost like poetry written by a 3rd grader.     Is it just me, or does writing down a whole song make your "whatever it is a person likes to write on" look tacky? Take this for example...     The Big Ass   by: Ass Face      I hate  my life   and   EVERYTHING THAT'S IN IT.   So I...   Found my ass, and  found that   it was big.      OHHHHHHH   my ass is big   my ASS is  BIG   My ass is so damn really   big?      Whenever I look into the  eyes of the   mirror   I see a big ass.   That's   right.   By the way  my   life sucks.      So I killed myself and everyone di   dn't care.       So then I killed myself again.   Except my ass was too big and full  of fat.   So the bullet bounced right off.      As you can see in Example A, the song is boring to read and looks dumb written down. That's why it was made to be a song and not a diary entry.
