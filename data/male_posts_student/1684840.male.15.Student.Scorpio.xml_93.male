Finished a load of coursework off recently and we have a Biology exam on Wednesday.  I have been getting straight A*s in the practice tests... COME ONNNN!!!  I hope the real thing is just as easy as these ones ;)  French is utterly boring as usually, including all of the fake coursework we're doing for what purpose?!  Ooh.. and Checketts collapsed!!  Big news that was lol  Got to school to find ambulances with sirens ablazing.  Lots of people were bit shocked, others were scared and some people were even happy about it (which wasn't very nice).  I'll post some time this week.. lol :P
