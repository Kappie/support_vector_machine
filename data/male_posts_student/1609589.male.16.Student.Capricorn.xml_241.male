We shouldn't have watched Bruce Almighty... or Thirteen for that matter.  What a fucking stupid movie Thirteen was. And it's winning a Golden Globe? Christ!  When we had to watch it, I expressed my concern, but since it turned out to be either that, or wander the halls alone, I decided to watch it, I just decided to tough it out. But, I did make it known that I retained all rights to make fun of the movie so much it would make the director cry, and noone could tell me otherwise. And I did.  It was about a 13 year old girl who meets this mexican whore, and decides that sluttery is the way to go. And along the way, destroys her family, gets the shit punched out of her, AND gives a black guy a blow job. At least it was implied.  At this one point, her mom notices her belly button ring (which she did not allow her to get... ooh, the suspense!), and asked the question, "what is that?" as if she didn't know. I promptly rang out "It's a muffin! What the fuck does it look like?"  We had to plan this youth service thingy, and it was decided that some Blue-Mannery should be implemented. Drumbone will definitley be used, but my cousin has decided that she needs to sing something the offertory(you know, when the church takes your money every sunday?), so if they decide that it has to be a blue man song, I need funding to build a PVC instrument. Which is good if it turns out to be free for me, but we only have until May and we've just started planning.  Ughums, school starts again tomorrow so I'd better start the sleepin.
