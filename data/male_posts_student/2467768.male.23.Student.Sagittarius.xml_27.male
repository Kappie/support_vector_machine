It capture and presents some of the current software development best pratices  -------------------------------------------------------  Software Development Process  - serve as a guide for all the participants - must be the best the industry is capable of putting together at this point in its history - must be widely available , so all stakeholder can understand their role in the development  1)Technologies 2)Tools 3)People 4)Organisation process  -------------------------------------------------------  Process Overview - Two Dimensions  -horizontal axis      represent time and show the lifecycle -vertical axis      represents discipline, which the group activities took  -------------------------------------------------------  Time Dimension Phase  Iterations  -broken into cycles, each cycle working on a new generation of product  -------------------------------------------------------  Phases  1)Inception: set up the project business case 2)Elabroration: set up project plan  architecture 3)Construction: grow the system 4)Transition: Supply the system to its end users  -------------------------------------------------------  Static Dimension  1)Workers = Who 2)Activities = How 3)Artefacts = What 4) Workflow = When  -------------------------------------------------------  Rational Unified Process Conclusion  - use case driven, architecture centric, iterative and incremental and use UML -organises projects in terms of workflows and phase. -help find the right requirement and their use drives the development process  -------------------------------------------------------  Web based Vs Traditional Project  1)Strategy 2)User 3)Design  Strategy   (TP) -abstract -dimension indirectly -dimension not addressed at all  (web based) -tangible  visible -relates closely to businness goals  User (TP) -user is employee -user can be trainee -system might be mandatory -can be understood through work study -job satisfactionis a key aim  (web based) -user is a customer, who make payment for good and service -usage is not mandatory -user needs can be understood thru sales  marketing needs  Design (TP) -focus only internal -basic usability  (web based) -as a visual artefact -graphic skills is a must  --------------------------------------------------  Web Site Prototype  -Vertical Prototype could involve testing the exact functionality of a small section of a site -allows evalution of navigation system design
