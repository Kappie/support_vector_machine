 Can you imagine that we found 1 - in words: one - internet caf√©?? It was impossible for a tourist w/o internet in the hotel or a mobile with internet access to get online. Even my rural home town has at least one! One would expect that in a city like Munich there would be quite some more...
 
 Maybe my small-town attitude was expecting too much ... *g*
