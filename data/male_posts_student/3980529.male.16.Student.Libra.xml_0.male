I know that ESPN NFL2K5 and Madden 2005 just came out, but i'll do a review on them in my next gaming update.   Tales of Symphonia-92% I'm quite suprised that this RPG is so damn good considering it's for the Gamecube.   Pros- 80 hours of gameplay, storyline changes based on character relationship, cel-shaded graphics done by Kosuke Fujishima, and tons of mini-games and sidequests.   Cons- Battle System can get very confusing at times when it comes to controlling your three other characters.   Wow, it's the first review i've ever done here on GAMING of TODAY and the strange thing is, Idon't have a Gamecube. Well, I borrowed it from a friend cause I heard this game is so damn good. Anyway, i'll give you people a dash through the past giving you the scores of games like Halo, Gran Turismo 3 and all that.
