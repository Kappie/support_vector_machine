So far so good:  602 - 5 / 30  603 - 6 / 7 : completed one page today  690F - 8 / 15 : completed one page today Total - 19 / 52 = 36.5% completed with 22 more days to go.   I'd like to say that  Social Distortion 's  Live at the Roxy  is so much better than their studio stuff. Granted, their earlier stuff was done in ghetto punk rock fashion. However, there's so much more energy on their live album. I've seen Social D once, but not where they were headlining. I think next year, if I'm in town that is... I have to go to one of their HOB shows.  Oh yea... no  Tarzan  today in class... gotta wait until Thursday.  ***
