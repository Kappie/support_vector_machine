Well, not that any of you can tell, but I've been sitting here for about three minutes to try and come up with a second line; so I supose I shall just move on...      Back to the Political Machine, for those of you who went out and bought it, good job! I've got a few funny characters i can send you if you so desire. Namely: Arlen Spector, Rick Santorum, Marvin the Martian, Hitler, Mckain, JFK, and im working on Osama. In just a little while the ultimate showdown between Adolf Hitler, and Osama Bin Laden will begin. At stake - The American Presidecy. The winner - well either way we're screwed ;) But it sounds really funny!
