That is, until it started to rain. There's just something about it that is really soothing and calming like a silky bunny. Especially when there are floods everywhere. Damn i wanna go swimming now. I think i have become one with the water in recent years. ever since i did a moonsault into the pool i never wanted to get out. As soon as the pool opens, i will be the first one in there. Mabey, its not the rain thart relaxes me, but the water that the rain brings.  wow. im dedicating my blog time today to rain and water. how sad for me.
