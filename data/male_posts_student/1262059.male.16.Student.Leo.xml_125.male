I've decided to cut of MSN (for like the  n  th  time this year), and so far I'm succeeding. Really... need... to... chat.... *dumps cold water on head* much better ^^    I spent most of today finishing off the 3 rd  book for the Protector of the Small quartet. I've already burnt through 3 other quartets: Song of the Lionness, the Immortals, and Circle of Magic. I really liked the Circle of Magic quartet, though it starts off a different storyline. Song of the Lionness -> the Immortals -> Protector of the Small quartets all follow the same storyline. Yup, that's  12   books on Tortall, get reading Hoshi XP  As for the second set of books, Circle of Magic -> The Circle Opens quartets seem to be interesting so far, though i haven't even  touched  The Circle Opens quartet. Yes, and as the name suggests, quartet = 4 books.   Yesterday was really interesting, hoshi came to visit, and keane was actually allowed to stay. Ana-sama told us to work on the art show... but didn't really enforce that. So i was like "meh"... just was hung around with them. It was raining outside... like... hail... and i decided to leave around 5:30pm. Twish, Janice, Hanna and Kristina came back from somewhere... and since we were going the same way, i decided to wait a bit with Parry. Then keane and hoshi left. Then finally we left, and waited like forever. Luckily I had an umbrella... ph34r d4 umb3l4! Still though... when i got home my hands were like freezing... --;;   That's all for now, ja!   ~ Chronos
