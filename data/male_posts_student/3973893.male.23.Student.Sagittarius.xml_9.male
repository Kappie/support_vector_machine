Went up  urlLink Brice Creek  and found a nice place to camp, but more importantly we were next to the most perfect swimming hole I have ever seen, which we affectionately dubbed “Casa Bonita.” I can't wait to go back.          Got the  urlLink TiVo  yesterday and set it up. Wow, is this thing amazing. Now I'll never miss another  urlLink Queer Eye for the Straight Guy  ;) And I've already set it up to record all  urlLink Star Trek: TNG  episodes that air on TV. Speaking of Star Trek - I hope you all are aware of  urlLink Trekkies 2  being released this month.           …the most informative moments from this astounding world tour…another fascinating look at the world through the eyes of the people we have come to know as 'Trekkies.'
