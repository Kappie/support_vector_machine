There hasn't been an earthqauke here in a couple years.......    k, it's over now, but that was kinda scary. It was nothing serious but my bed was shaking pretty good (weeeeee like a roller coaster.... k not really).    Just thought I'd write this down while it was happening.    The end.... sleep now.
