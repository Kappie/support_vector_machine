The knowledge that I don't need any of the classes I'm taking has provided me with an even bigger slacker attitude than before, which is...interesting.  Socially I have a much less defined group of people. I've been spending time with lots of different people. The freshman satisfy my appetite for new people, but I've been getting to know some of the old ones better. Namely, I hanged out with Mary Joy after school, and I realized that it was the first time I'd ever done that.  Kelly pops in and out of Palo Alto, and that provides me with something of a constant. Today we went to see Ms. Lo, something I didn't actually find that appaling strangely enough. I don't really hate her. I can't. She's too much like me. She is just obsessed with making everyone like her, which is a major flaw of mine as well. Her personality also changes based on who she's around, so sometimes she's much more tolerable than others.  So we stopped in at a rehearsal(Portia and Elan were there), and I realized I really wished I had auditioned. The play looks pretty good, and I feel a need to be doing something with all this time I have.  So I thought to myself, "I'll do something later in the year." I then realized I couldn't very well if I'm not a Paly student. Maybe I can talk with her and see if she'll make an exception and let me direct something for the one-acts. That would be tight. I realized I didn't want to have my last play at Paly to be "Oh Dad", which I didn't really enjoy.  I find myself disliking people a lot less this year. It's not just Ms. Lo. There are others, who for years I've disliked and only now I realize are tolerable. I won't bring myself to say I like them.  People are starting to ask me what I'm interested in doing after college. I don't think I've been seriously asked then since I was 7, and wanted to be a "fire fighter/writer/comedian/video game maker/president". So I think before answering and I really just be honest and say I have no freaking clue.  Japanese is fun and all, but what careers can I apply it to? Interpretation is too stressful, translation is too boring. I still would enjoy living in Japan, but in 10 years will I wake up and realize it was a stupid childish idea?  I would love to be a voice actor. If I received a chance at it I would jump at the oppurtunity. Unfortunately, this is one of the hardest industries to break into. On the other hand, if I was living in Japan, I would just never get a job as a voice actor, because I'm white. How amusing.  I want to go visit Claudia.
