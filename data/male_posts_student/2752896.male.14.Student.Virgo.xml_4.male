The worst part is, they all smell like bug repellent =S (note: next door, my sister is singing Barbie Girl.... yes that's how bored i am) went to chrystal's yesterday. Had a BLAST played video games all night long.... W00T! MARIO TENNIS!!!! and played MAHJONG!!! owned you all with my two wins in a row!!! hahah... and it wasn't much of a movie night btw, as it was supposed to be. we only watched bourne identity, which i only watched half, because i was playing  videogames andmahjong most of the time. that was basically all of last night  played golf today... driving range only lol, not good enough to be on the holes infact, i suck at golf a lot!!!:D hehe... i can only hit about 120, and that's on the rare  occasion when i don't miss =Ãž considering it's mi first time in about 4 years...  it's plenty good!!! ----- Leave a Comment Dammit!
