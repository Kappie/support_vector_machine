Grrrr, my head is about to explode.  It hurts to be alive.  And yet I have to be.  I've got an assload of work to do (Senior Thesis).  I've also got a stressful time with my application to AU.  I just gave the financial aid application to my mom with instructions to have it returned by Wednesday and she started trippin' out about how whenever I want her to do something it has to be done immediately but whenever she wants me to do something for her I put it off forever.  Ugh, I don't want to hear that.  She even said, "what if I don't do this for you?"  Well, if she doesn't then I don't get need-based financial aid from American University.  Hmmm, yeah, I think she can get this  two-page  application to me by Wednesday.  BTW: I'm sending off my application to AU on Friday so they will definately have it before November 15.  Aaaaahhhh, I'm scared and my head hurts a lot.
