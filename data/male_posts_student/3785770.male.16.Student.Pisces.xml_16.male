Instead just boot up VMware and load the iso from cd or just from a folder somewhere on your pc. it also is a very easy way to install any linux distro if you want to take that route, but i recomend just useing it with knoppix and getting a junker for you fully installed linux distros. So its a great app I highly recomend it, get it at http://www.vmware.com/
