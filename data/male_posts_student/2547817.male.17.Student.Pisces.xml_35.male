It's close to home and there could be a lot of opportunity for me. I might lead the choir and get into the council. I would be a big fish in a small pond. Not sure academics wise though.  ACJC: From what I gather, the school sucks you dry- financially and the teachers don't really give much of a damn. They expect us to be "highly self-motivated" people. In addition, the powerful posts are dominated by ACSi and MGS students. It's hard for a Fairsian to make it big in ACJC. Their choir is good, but it's difficult to get in. If I join the choir, I wont be able to join the council. So do I give up my passion for leading or my passion for singing. I'd never even consider the latter, but there is a choice to be made. Good part is that I can walk over to my alma mater as and when I please. She's be there. Just seeing her face would be good enough.  Confused about Zel. She doesn't wanna tell me if she still loves me. Wonder why. Not sure, but wont give up. She just told me to fuck off when I told her that I wasn't going to leave it alone, that I wasn't going to stop hoping. That's the only thing that I live for now. There's nothing else. She said that she was confused, trapped and frustrated when we fought. I'm thinking, well, I sure as hell didn't do that. Just because I don't acknowledge it, doesn't mean that I don't feel similarly. All I've got is a faded picture of her in my mind and an affectionate name to call to the air in despair. Why are you trying to face what little I have from me. Love is about holding on. Till death do us part. I'll never let go Rose, I'll never let go. I'm all melancholic now.  It's funny, I was going to write about how great my day went. Now look at me. Pining over my hopes again. My hopes, my memories, my emotions, my being, my loss. Remember my girlfriend fate, with the twisted hands? She caressed me again, felt queasy.  Yesterday, shitty day----> better than shitty day.  Today, Great day (night actually)----> Very shitty night.  Suicide is not an option. An alternative may be something equally SCARRRING.
