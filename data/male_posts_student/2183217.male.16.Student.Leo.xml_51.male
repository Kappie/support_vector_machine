I was trying to settle down for sleep, all curled up cozy in my comforter and watching the last of a biography on Cher when a black thunderbolt burst into the room.  Face covered in what looked like a pair of black underwear except for the wild eyes full of menace, the dark, gangly weirdo struck what was supposed to be a Ninja pose. It then attempted a somersault on the floor, i  it was such an awkward tumble that floor shook so hard the pictures almost fell off the walls. It shrieked hysterically and made a fast exit once it saw the potential murder in my horrified expression.  My daughter...the ninja idiot.     Ok that is my mom’s version of the story that happened yesterday. Here is mine.   About an hour after I was already assumed to be sleeping, I was in my room searching “How To Be A Ninja” on Google. I stumbled upon instructions on how to make yourself look like a ninja. Snickering mechanically I carefully put on my eye make up and wrapped a shirt around my face and neck the way the site told me to. Then I practiced some ninja poses before I made my attack. At just about midnight I attempted a ninja roll into my moms sleeping area (AKA the living room). It didn’t quite look as GRACEFUL as a proper ninja roll because I started laughing and I hurt my neck . So in a panic I started doing some summer saults. There wasn’t much room so when I felt my legs knock something over I sprang up. I heard my mom yelling but I couldn’t see because my warrior mask (aka black t shirt) was over my eyes. I started tripping everywhere and that made me laugh even harder which was making me suffocate. I struggled to get the shirt off my face so I could breathe and the minute I did I saw my moms glare. It appeared that she had turned into some sort of demonic sea queen while I was rolling around on the floor. I quickly vanished from the scene before she could attack.     The next morning I woke up to the sound of screaming from the other room like I told you usually happened on school days. “I’m toooo tirrreeeddd” I exclaimed… “ARGH ARGH YOU WERENT TO TIRED TO ACT LIKE A NINJA AT MIDNIGHT LAST NIGHT” was the angered reply from the monster in the next room.   Ninja: 1 , Mom: 0     Anyways that’s my version. Who do YOU believe!  o_O! Oh yeah and here's the site if you shit heads wanna try it...  urlLink Be A Super Cool Ninja Warrior
