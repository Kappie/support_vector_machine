Thanks a lot to our readers, yeah, all five of you!  Anyway, maybe I should try the doing another poem sometime, hmm?    Well, I haven't been readin' the blog lately, and I haven't gotten a chance to actually make a new post myself.  But it seems that things are goin' just fine around here, so I've got nothin' to complaim about!  Good news for you guys, I'm not gonna bitch!  Oh, I heard about a new contest goin' on here.  I don't fully understand it though, cuz I am fuckin' slow, but its somethin' like sendin' an e-mail with a completed phrase...Well, first off, if its  a contest , shouldn't we offer  a prize ?  I mean, come on, we know the fuckin' people who read this damn blog, its not like everyone in the whole fuckin' world reads this blog or anythin' like that.  And come on, reality check.   Society  doesn't do things without expectin' to get somethin' back in return.  Secondly, since I know  the readers  personally, I know that they're a bunch of lazy asses who prolly won't send in a completed phrase.  We'd be lucky to get an angry e-mail.  Anyway, despite all that, I guess the contest is still runnin', so if you do find a strange urgency to participate, (which would be nice by the way) drop me a line at:  ThEPuNkRoCkKiD13@aol.com .  You can also click on  Nick's  picture to send him an e-mail...I think he made a link or somethin'...  You know, it wouldn't be so bad to here from you guys though.  I mean, yeah, I'll prolly be seein' you guys like every fuckin' day of the week know that school is startin' soon but....god dammit, do it for me!  I really wanna know the hell I can make this the best fuckin' blog on the damn planet...Oops, I forgot the  P.R.E.   Well this can be a close second....J/K!  Anyway, yeah I'd like to know what you guys wanna see on here.   Nick  has launched a bunch of his own projects, like the contest, which I wasn't briefed about (no,  Nick , I'm not mad, I was just merely statin' that I wasn't briefed about it) and  Nick's   newspaper column-like  blogs.  So drop us a line sometime, and tell us what you wanna hear!  I mean, this is a blog for the public, right?  Then we want you to get involved too!  What kinda shitheads would we be if we didn't?  So fuckin' get involved...I know where all you motherfuckers live too...!  Oh yeah, so thats whats goin' on with the blog currently.  The  "Complete-a-Phrase" Contest , and me threatin' the readers to get involved in the blog...oh yeah, it seems  Operation: Revolution  came over here on the  T.E.W.  and has started to go into motion.   Nick  posted a book review recently for  Rats Saw God .  Strange, the title.  I didn't know rats had religious beliefs too...Who knows?  Its a fucked up world isn't it?  Well, I dunno if there is anythin' else to blog about right now.  And I really wanna go and take a shower (heh, wanna join?).  So yeah, I'll blog later...
