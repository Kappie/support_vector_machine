Someone that stands by them no matter what.  And someone that they do stuff with.  Its not even a boy/girlfriend sort of thing because those things I am not really worried about.  Its just the matter of a friend that I can confide in.  I mean, not to sound angsty, but there is no one for me.    Maybe its me.  Maybe I'm a complete and utter jackass that no one likes or no one can really see themselves getting close to.  I'm not an open person, I don't embrace people at the drop of a hat.  I don't even like to touch people that much.  Or have people touch me.  But that doesn't really matter.  Maybe I joke too much and people find me superficial, unreal.  I never tell anyone my problems, well, not usually.  I never open up, you know?  I'm just me to people and nothing more.  Just skins and bones.  I blamed my father for my lack of a confidante.  He hates my friends and never approves of them.  My mother never talks to my friends and it makes me feel that I have bad friends, which I don't.  I think I have awesome friends, but sometimes something is nagging at the back of my mind.  My parents tell me never to trust anyone and that all I have is my family.  Well, I don't like my family all that much.  I am not close to my brothers.  I am not close to my mother or my father.  I don't tell them my feelings or my problems because I can't find the right words and I always think that they would just belittle me or not really care about my problems at all.  I mean, what kind of person has such dumb problems?  A dumb person, thats who.  Anyway, I have never given many people my trust.  Eh, don't know why.  Maybe its because of my parents and maybe its because of me.  Or maybe its because of something that is out of my control.  Maybe I haven't met anyone worthwhile to spill my secrets to.  I mean, I'm only 17 and where am I?  I'm in a life that I did not choose to be in.  I don't have my freedom yet.  My dad still controls my hair.  He controls what I wear to some extent.  Maybe when I am able go on my own that will I find new people.  Or maybe the thought of soulmates is entirely fictional.  Another person that was made that can understand me.  Far-fetched.  Optimistic.  Too good to be true.  Is it too good to be true.  Am I just chasing an idea that is not real?  A fruitless search for gold?  But then why do other people have soulmates?  How do they have soulmates?  How do they have someone else that knows exactly what movie they like?  How?  Or maybe its just all a trick.  No one is really truely friends with anyone else.  Or that I'm asking way too much for something that shouldn't be asked for.  Whatever.
