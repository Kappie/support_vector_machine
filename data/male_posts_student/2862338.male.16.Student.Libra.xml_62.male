Kinda boring, but thats because it wasn't carefully planned out and stuff.  Um, what else.  I explained my whole thoughts about why i wanted to Go to hernie's, lemme explain.  The LAN party, as stated above wasn't going no where.  It was about the 4-5th hour in, and i was getting kinda bored...Jorge signs online, and we tell him to come over to benny's...after several little excuses he told me he thinks hernie wants him to sleep over....at that time, i began to think of what i had to do, and i'm gonna explain it for all those that still don't understand.  I am relitivly new to antioch...i'm  pretty much as new as you can get.  Well, despite that, you become very close with people very fast.  And with this speed, comes care for that person.  Well, you see, the problem with all this is that as cool, and good as these new freinds are, they're all going after this year, which, really sucks.  So, enter Hernie and Jorge.  Appaerntly they had a project going down to show some appreciation.  And no, i'm not gonna tell you what it is....but anyway, they let me in, and since then, we've been wanting to get together to work on it.  BUT, we could never find a time where we were all free....so when jorge told me this, and seeing the current situtation, i thought, "hey, wow, this is a perfect time to practice!"  Well, i told everyone this, thinking they'll say "ok, good, this is getting boring anyway, we might as well leave", and well, that didn't happen.  Jones immediatly objected...and so did the other guys.  And now when i think about it, it would have been selfish of me to leave like that, so  i'm sorry guys...you know how these kinda things go....   Well, anyway, the night ended...well, acutally, it ended inthe morning...around 2 to be exact....well, not much to say there, got home, did the sleep thing, then woke up the next day...and i acutally don;t remember a thing after that....and i'm being totally honest about that.  The only other thing i can remeber was Yesterday, last period.  We didn;t do much, Mr. north wasn't there, so me, and the rest of the class did basically whatever we wanted...the sub was this jaimican lady, so yeah.....anyway, about 10 minutes in, maylene walks up to me....i'm thinking "awsome" right? well, she sits down, and we begin talking...turns out it wasn't for a sexual favor, but for a proposition....she's got this business thing going on at her house, and she wanted to get me in on it....she chose me, cause everyone else was immature, and thought it was a scam...i have my  doubts, but thats not the important thing.....i'm suppose to go to her house on Friday...tomarrow,  BUT  i'm going to box city....a pointless thing where we sleep in boxes for a night to know how it feels liek to be homeless...yes, yes, i know, all that time were spending pretending, we can be acutally doing something, but i think i found out the true purpose of it...to raise money for the midnight run, which is acutally something to help them.  I'm going cause it's just another oppertunity to chill with people.  I have my "talk" on sunday..it's gonna be off the hizzle, fo' shizzle...but yeah, more on that AFTER i read it...And now that i think about it....in my circle of freinds....all of the guys in antioch are moving further away from the guys that aren;t...the most notable is Jones.  And jones know this, but it's only today that i realize it.  And, i'm sorry, it's hard to split time up, but juss know that Jones, and everyone else is still cool in my book, no matter WHAT goes down.    Well, yeah, that brings me to today.  I schooled till 2:30, as usual, and i had to stay after to make up a  math quiz...now, i never did it, and by this time i forgot, so i asked Mr. Fink what it was on, then he was like "secants, and Tangents". then i remmeber what it was about..turns out it was totally different than what i thought...and to top it off, my mom this morning was like, "i'll pick up,but i can;t give rides cause i have to go to college..." well, all that pressure made me give up, adn i ended up answering none of the questions...ya...i was real pissed....i see sabby in the hall, ask him if he saw my mom, and he said no, but immideatly asked for a ride...i said "we'll see" cause i was sure my mom was gonna say no (that is, if she was still there), but, she was there, and i ended up driving....on the this turn, i went over the curb..not cool....but it's only cause i was soo pissed off...Anyway, i get home, eat and shit, and then had an urge to get to the gym...as a joke (well, not really, cause i ALWAYS say it) i ask my mom if i can get the car...and she says yes!! it was sooo awsome!  FINALLY! I get TO DRIVE BY MYSELF!!   So yeah, that went pretty cool, no problems or nothing...came back home in about a hour and a half or so...O, and by the way, to those that are like "thats fucked up, you shoulda have called"...well, here's the thing....it would have been fucked up of me to call, it had No point at all...I couldn't give anyone a ride there, or back, so i'd basically be calling to tell you that i'm going...thats all....so i mean, ya, sorry for any incovience.  But ya.....so now i'm here....typing this out...talking to Steph on the IM, and listening to Music...O!! by the way, if you don;t already have it, get D12 - My Band...that song is soo fucking awsome... But yeah....i'm bored now..... so, i hope this made for some intresting reading....sorry, no juicy secrets to say this time..i got rid of most of them when i started this blog...so...PEACE OUT (yea, i had ALOT more shit to type, like always....but like always...i dun wanna...simple as that...!)
