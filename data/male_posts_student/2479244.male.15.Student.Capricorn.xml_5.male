I don't really intend to write things in here with hopes of people reading it, but I do it just so I know that people can really find out what I'm like inside this funny little shell. I keep thinking that I should make this introduction something I will remember, catchy phrases and unique wisdom, but its not really coming out that way. Thats all okay though. I'm just glad I can finally write some things down.  I guess I have had a bit of stuff on my mind today. Nothing huge, just those everyday thoughts. Recently, I've been wanting to find a way to channel my anger into something that will come out good, but what I would really like is just to get rid of all my animosity with everything all together - leave my feelings, my thoughts, my philosophies, my politics, my agression and everything else at the door. However, thats a lot easier said than done. I feel like a lot of my agression comes from things like loud noises, loud people, offensive behavior, annoying people, and the like. I think that if I stand back and look at all that, the only way I could possibly avoid it would be to move to a small island, away from Americans, away from zealous, 'pieous,' 'informed' people. Sure, I don't intend on that right now, but I've always felt that maybe some time in the future I would move to a different country. Maybe England or Canada, no where strange and oriental. That probably sounds weird to a lot of people, but hey, maybe opening up my mind to new things will make me a little more at peace with myself.  I don't know what else to say today. Not a lot. Come back later if you want to delve into the mind of Mr. Goldberg.
