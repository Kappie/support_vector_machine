You type ENTIRELY too much! *falls over*  And I had a kick arsnage time in Tennessee, tank oo very muchies! I learned how to skate...properly that is....and I started to watch the Ring...but, of course,  me being the wuss I am, I freaked out and demaded the damn DVD be destroyed. And before all this, I got to hear the smacky smacky of my best bud nearly screwing her boyfriend while I was sposed to be spending time with her at her house..ah well. The curses of being me.  The events of today: I woke up in the early morn in Louisiana... My back did a chain poppy thing, which hurt like a biatch by the way, I cursed the Roll-Away my mom made me sleep on and I got ready for another EIGHT hours on the road...I got in the car, put on my lurvely 3 Doors Down  Away From the Sun  CD, layed back the seat, and fell asleep right until we get an hour away from the hell they call Deer Park so we could go to the place called Cracker Barrell to eat....Meatloaf ees good Then I ate candy buttons until we pulled up next to my little apartment. I went in and collapsed...ah...the joys of  clean homeliness.  And all that leads up to me reading what Caleb rambles on day...after day...after day....after...um...sorry...  Caleb! YOU LIE! Most of the music they play nowadays is evil Britney Spears poppy crap...My music is NOT bad! *slumps* Listen to der lyrics...I pwomise they have meaning...and...yeah...there are some bad instrumental peoples behind bad lyrics...but those two things go hand in hand. Go get some stuffies by 3 Doors Down, Staind,hmm....what else...avoid Manson at all costs...I like 'em...but you'd curse me to hell if I suggested him. Oh..Puddle of Mudd...Godsmack, The White Stripes, Audioslave, KoRn's older stuff, Nirvana (Listen to them or DIE), And since you are an intullectual person, I suggest Deadsy. Good band...hmmm...what else.... I'll post some more stuffies latersies. And if anyone has any other suggestions to get Caleb a musical life outside the wonderful Jazz music that he listens to, just lemmeh know...or something...I dunnah....  And yes, Caleb does have good taste in music, but he needs to add s'more genres to his list.   Umm...lesse...Manders not quite the experienced RPer Caleb ees. Manders wittle bitty technical Newbie. Her skills go from a little bit of D to full scale adicted to Achaea person. Ah well.  I've noticed Mr. Thunderbolt Boy likes the phrase "Knock You On Your Ass funny."  Here's my favorite! "See what you can accomplish while you're sober?" Hee hee, Yes! *headbang*  Oh, and when is my lovely site getting a link on here, Caleb? Eh?EH?? YOU knoooow you have it...it should be right at the top of yer favorites list....fix the problem..FIX it!  The Happy Tree Friends are scary. They die...a lot...poor little bunnies and squirrels...*sigh*  OH! OH! Read JtHM! er..Johnny the Homicidal Maniac! You can find the comics at your local Hot Topic store in malls everywhere! Whee! And after you read JtHM you should read Squee and the all color comics called I Feel Sick! Whee! Vasquez kicks ARSE! *bounce*  Well, since I am through suggesting that coconuts DO migrate (They have wings I tell you! Wings! Muwahaha!), I will leave you.   *vulcan hand*   -Manders
