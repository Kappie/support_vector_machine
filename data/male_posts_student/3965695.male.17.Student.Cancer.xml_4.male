I laid around for awhile, sleeping, and that was nice, then headed to Wildwood, (New Jersey: the armpit of America) for Fun in the Son, a christian youth conference. That was womping good. David Crowder and friends (music group) rocked and the speakers had solid messages. Then home for a few days before a short trip to visit my aunt and uncle in louisvile KY. We went to a few minor league baseball games, and it was pretty fun. Then summer got interesting.   After that trip, I prepared to go on a missiontrip to Jamaica. I didnt know much about the island, other than the fact that there were pretty much two locations, the resorts and the real Jamaica. Most white people are tourists who travel to a Carribbean island like Jamaica and never see what the island is really like. I knew that as missionaries, we would be in the "untouristy" part of the island, but I was utterly floored by my surroundings when we arrived. We flew into Montego Bay (beautiful beaches, fast food, and tourists; everything that I really dislike) and waited around, ate lunch at the airport (at this amazing little restaurante entitled Island Grilll), played cards, and relaxed (we had gotten up at 330 that morning) until a second group arrived sans their youth leader. He (Matt Otto, very cool guy, 24 yrs old) had been the person without a seat on the plane due to overbooking. So we loaded the buses and began the trip                   to a town called Catadupa, located                   twentysome miles away. We stopped to exchange all 40 peoples US money into Jamaican dollars, called "J"s (exchange rate is 60 J to one US dollar) While we waited on the bus for the leaders to do this, we experienced a taste of the Jamaican culture, that is, everyone who walked by wanted to make sure we were having fun and enjoying ourselves. Well apparently one man (probably tweaked up on weed, which is obviously a huge part of their culture) made some moves on a girl or two in our group. These girls proceeded to calmly ignore him. This upset the man greatly, and he started screaming at us, calling us fake Christians, and saying that what we stood for was bullpoop (he used stronger language). He left (after actually boarding our bus to yell at us), and the guys in the front of the bus were greatly confused, because we didnt know that he had been touching girls and saying some rude things, and we thought that they should have just talked to him. This caused some angst in the group until it was all settled, but it was an interesting way to begin the trip.   We then traveled up some mountains, flying around blind turns in a coach-sized bus on a road that was about 20 feet wide and two lanes. It was insane. Along the way, we saw immense foliage, immense beauty, and immense poverty. The drivers in Jamaica are amazing, the horns are used for saying hello, goodbye, hows it going, im coming around a turn at 50 kph, etc, but never in anger, and we navigated bridges in this huge bus over which I would be frightened to drive a sedan. We then arrived in Catadupa, and went to the elementary school where we slept. A 40ish person group from pittsburg was already there (our group of 22 and the maryland group of 12 made a total of around 80) and we settled in and had some free time. About6 oclock I learned that Adam Hake ( who plays the jimbay and is wicked good) some girls who sing and myself on guitar would be leading worship that night at 730. I got out my guitar, and lo and behold when I was tuning it my G-string broke. I was repairing it and my backup g string broke. At dinner Brad (the evening program coordinator) asked me in front of the entire group if I was ready to go that night. I decided to break some "ice" between the groups, so I said "All I need is a G-string." Everyone laughed and it was all good. I then went to tune my guitar sans gstring, and my Dstring broke. So I borrowed Matt Otto's (who still had not arrived) guitar for the night.  Sunday was church, which absolutly rocked. Pastor Leroy, the Jamaican connection with World Servants (the organization we went with), gave one of the most passionate and well constructed sermons I have ever heard. Then, he was kinda asking the crowd if anyone wants to sing a song, say some words, etc later in the service, and Amy (the main World Servants staffperson) asked if Adam, the girls, and myself would do a version of Amazing grace that we had written a little while ago. So we went up and Adam used the drum set and there was an eltric guitar for me, a rather nice one, and I pluged in and strummed an A chord. I had already realized that I had no pick so I was a little "tense" about how it would sound and such. Well guess what. The Jamaicans who did the music didnt use the guitar at all that day for a reason. It was dreadfully out of tune. I quickly tried to tune a could notes, but Adam had started playing and the girls were already singing, so I played mostly horrible sounding power chords very softly. That was interesting. Later that day the three Jamaicans who played music were chilling at our home for the week, and I walked past them with my half dead guitar (two pegs are chipped and held in w/ duct tape, and some other stuff is messed up). They grabbed my guitar, threw on my strings for me (using a b string for the g ) and we played around for a good hour, hour and a half, playing some worhip songs that were familiar to all of us. It was very cool.  Then on monday, we did music for kids club. I dont think of myself as good with kids, and I kinda dont like little kids very much. However, the kids in Jamaica are amazing. This is kinda gonna turn into a little rant against American society. I find that little kids here in the states are horribly spoiled, selfish, and sheltered. Parents cater to their every whim, and most middle class and upper class kids are complete brats. I can't stand them. The same aged kids in Jamaica dont want the latest toy, dont want more video games, dont want anything except love. That, I discoverd, I can do. Little girls (ages 5-8 ish) actually were sitting me down and doing my hair, little kids of all ages all wanted to climb on everyone, and I had at least two on my back/arms/neck/waist/legs at all times. This one little guy drew a picture of me, goatee and all, and shyly gave it to me. I dont cry easily, and I tend to not show much emotion; i could be incredibly happy or angry, and I kinda always have the same expression on my face. However, this is a little kid whom i had met for about 10 minutes, had been on my back for a bould and in my lap for a coule, and he all of a sudden wanted to give me a picture he had drawn. At that point i didnt even know the kids name (it was CJ). I had trouble for a couple minutes, cause I was dumbfounded by this kid. He had nothing, I was the rich white missionary coming to Jamaica for only a week before coming back to my massive home in the US to live in sickening comfort. And  he  was giving me something he had made, and this was after a couple minutes. wow. Kids club was the first real wakeup call God gave me this past week, telling me that He can do things in very unexpected ways- I would never have guessed that the two days I spent at kids club- about 5 hours in all- would be the highlight of the trip for me. Another cool thing at kids club was on tuesday, when the same amazing kids (125 of them in all) came back and displayed the same need for love and giving it freely that shocked me and amazed me. with about 5 inutes left at kids club, we were lining the kids up to leave, and I had a little group of about 6 kids that were all over me that day, and I was kinda herding them out, and they left. I was just walking around and I felts this little hand grab my pinky finger. I looked down and this adorable little girl said "lift me up" and I did. In about a minute she was asleep, her head on my shoulder. She slept for a bit and then woke up, and would not let go. 15 minutes later she had to be pried off of me. It was a very cool experience, to be able to fill her need for love for just 15 minutes was awesome.   All this while we had been getting to know the community members, and the attitude of Jamaica, the "no problem, mon", and "no worries" ; the laid back and extremely friendly and open culture was awesome. I felt myself kind of just slipping in, and I found that if something was late, or if the toilet was rank or showers occured when it was raining so all the clothes were wet, or whatever problemswe encountered, I was able to simply trust in God to take care of it, and to not stress out over anything. It was wonderful.    Well, its late and I have some crazy Montezuma's revenge from the trip. There is so much more and it will have to wait until tomorow. Congrats on actually reading this far, if anyone did. The trip was awesome- if anyone wants to talk about it or what-have-you, comments etc, drop me a line or comment or something. This blogs for both my use and yours- you get to  see a little of how my brain works, my thoughts, and my opinions, and I want some feedback. If I say something on here that you disagree with, I want to hear from you. thats enough for tonight.     I leave with a quote                   and a short reflection                   ... Carl Sandburg claimed  "          I won't take my religion from any man who never works except with his mouth."      God is love, and to simply say it is not enough. I met people in Jamaica who were inspired by the mere fact that we rich white people cared about them enough to come and give a week of our lives to better theirs. This process of putting faith into action is found in every religion, from Islam to Christianity to Hinduism etc. Sometimes as Christians we tend (as I use a horribly overused cliche) to talk the talk and not walk the walk. I believe mission work of any kind, whether it be in Africa, South America, Europe, or York, Pennsylvania, elaborate missions or simple compassion to a neighbor, is what we need to do in order to have any kind of spiritual life. This is the Great Commision, and fulfilling it is extremely satisfying.     Peace    Ryan Mosser
