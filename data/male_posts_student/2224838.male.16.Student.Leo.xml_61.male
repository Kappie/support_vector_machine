It took me about an hour to sort through my mess of code, but I think I like the changes overall, and I'll try as hard as I can to keep them around for a while. Now that I'm satisfied, it would be nice if all two or three of my loyal readers could give me some feedback of some sort in the comments. This way I will know just how soon to start changing everything again. Also, you can include some of your favorite links, blogs, or movies, and I will check them out. If I like them enough I'll slap them on the sidebar as well.  Holla!
