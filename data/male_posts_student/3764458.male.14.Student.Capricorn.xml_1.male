The day has been so depressing, just because its all cloudy and horrible outside. I'm still at my dad's house, and i don't really want to go home, because we have no internet. I live off of the internet. I only get to get on every-other-weekend. We're planning on getting DSL out at my mom's place, though. We have an HP computer there, and it sucks like no other. It's only got like 4 megs of space left on it. Of course the computer is the only fun thing at my dads because we dont have cable tv. I kind of want to do something tonight. Just to make up for how depressing this day has been. Some people on AIM i just want to murder because they talk to you, and they like, have nothing to talk about, and they don't care about you at all, they just feel like talking to you because you one of the 4 people on their buddylist. I'm going to start writing the script for my movie, which i plan to come out with by January 2005. It's based on my livejournal called "The Diary of a Hitman." I can tell you one thing, i'm gonna need lots of fake blood and hot butter. I don't know what inspired me to write those. I based half of them on my nightmares. I have the creepiest nightmares. I die in every single one of them. Even if they are good dreams, i'll die in the end. I had a dream earlier today that i was fight Stone Phillips with one of those over-sized Q-Tip looking things that were used on some video game. I think it was like American Gladiators or something like that. Anyway, he knocked out of the ring and fell into a bottemless pit, and when you fall in a bottemless pit you die of starvation, but luckily enough for me, at the same time i fell, a murderer with a pistol jumped in with me. And as you can guess, he shot me. That dream kinda sucked. Well i gotta go. Buh bye all.
