Speaking of radio transmissions, today I became a technician class amateur radio operator.  Yeah, you may laugh now, but we'll see who is laughing when I am dispatching ambulance services during the early stages of the apocalypse.  Everyone I know is going to get brain cancer from the cell phones, so I, feeling left out, thought I need to do some catching up in the brain damage department.  I'll still have an edge though, because I don't drink.  So the record still stands, I get hurt more at Panera than at a non-sissy job (maintenance at SAU).  So does this make Panera a non-sissy job?  Yes.  Yes it does.  Does it make SAU maintenance a sissy job?  Not on your life my Hindu friend (ah, The Simpsons).  What is with the letter X and technology?  My example today will be operating system names.  Both Windows and Macintosh have the letter X in their current OS name.  For those of you who are not Roman, Apple's use of the X represents the number ten.  I'm not sure about Microsoft's use of the X in XP.  But either way they both have it.  And so do a lot of computer related devices.  If this X reminds us of something that is cutting edge and futuristic, then what will represent the next generation of toys?  Y?  Z?  Some sort of new, cutting edge, futuristic letter?  Maybe once the aliens take over we will have a new alphabet to work with.  But then again we will just be their pawns building a ray gun to destroy some distant planet we have not even heard of.  Which brings me back to:  Everything can be related to a Simpsons moment.  Don't blame me, I voted for Kodos.  Speaking of voting and elections and such...  Here is today's RNC Campaign Tactic of the Day:  Request Catholic parish directories to contact those "who are likely to be supportive of President Bush's compassionate conservative agenda" (Martin J. Gillespie, director of Catholic Outreach at the RNC).  This post brought to you by Awesome Transitions.
