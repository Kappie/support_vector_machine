You're often sneaky and underhanded, but you're definately not a flat-out liar.  About the factual stuff with debates. I didn't mean that your arguments were weak because you didn't pull up a bunch of facts. It just seemed whenever you argued with Schilling you were constantly on the defensive; you never fully brought down any of his facts without saying "so?", and rarely made any attacks without seeming tired of arguing and turning sarcastic as though you'd just thrashed him totally.   Clearing up, THE ONES THAT SCARE ME often are very intelligent, but have just seen the world in a different way than I. Brought up in a starkly Catholic conservative household, vs. Wanninger, and who knows what the heck he was but certainly not religious conservatism, it's easy to see how his perspective has been formed. Sure that he is right, he simply adds and adds to his argument. I was awfully impressed though that Schilling and Tay's awfully poor argument brought him to do research on the matter. It's possible they had slightly phazed him.   I like it when old people swear. It's more authentic, more brutally real. Nowadays, every f***ing kid is dropping a f***ing F-bomb every five f***ing seconds. After such repeated use and so on, it really loses its meaning.    Profanity is the crutch of a conversational cripple. ~ Jay Alexander  Old people don't swear unless they have reason too, for the most part. When they swear, its easily justified by their condition; they've lived through the nuclear age, when we don't know if we'll live to see tomorrow. They've fought at Normandy and Korea and Nam, they know a lot more about life. I hardly ever swear. I'm not offended by others oding it, but words are our most powerful weapons, and I prefer to reserve mine for occasions when they're called for, not something like stubbing my toe, or losing a game of tennis. Furthermore, as the above quote says, one can usually find a better way to say what they want to, and one that's almost always more specific to case than any curseword.
