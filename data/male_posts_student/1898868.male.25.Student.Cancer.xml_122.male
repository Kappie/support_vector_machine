In the past year and a half, I have developed a strong affinity for the egg salad sandwich.  I like mine tempered with garnish--- lettuce and tomato--- along with a bit of salt.  The bit of salt does the trick; it makes the egg salad piquant.  Egg salad has all the right nutrients.  Protein, starch, Vitamins A, B, C, D and Potassium.  It has just the right amount of Zinc, too.  Unlike Joel, who is 'Atkins-friendly' and who I have seen sneaking Michelob Ultra's into his refrigerator, I concentrate on getting all five food groups into my diet.  The egg salad sandwich is a great lunch item because it sets you up for a delicious, meaty dinner.  Please comment.
