I have no idea what we're doing but I'm going to try to have as much fun possible even for the fact that I'm being away from the things I actually find fun in my life.  I don't want that to sound like I'm complaining, but that's what I'm thinking.  I don't really want to go on this trip.  This is the first family vacation we've been on in a long time.  We normally just go to see relatives and just one or two people go out.  So it should be interesting.  Even though we are short one family member, it should be interesting.  I hope to take some pictures on the trip with my dad's digital camera.  He has a really nice Kodak Professional one that's a couple years old and is really bulky.  Thinking about lugging that around on a vacation is pretty funny.  Not really but what am I supposed to say.  I should probably be going now and getting ready.  Good night.
