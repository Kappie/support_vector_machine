A friend of mine and I armored up some cardboard and fireworks battleships with aluminum foil and duct tape and set them loose on each other. In the end they were both burned to pieces. However, the foil survived surprisingly well. There's nothing like fireworks to brighten your day.  A friend of ours came back from Canada. I don't know what he was doing up there, but I assume it was something to do with music. I think I'll be casting him for the part of Sgt. Colin Gregory. We should be able to get a shoot in, depending upon whether we can get another person in for filming. We'll do a 5-person setup, with me doing camera angles. Right now, things are fairly simple. Not being able to show any more than 4 people at a time is rather limiting. I suppose we'll find a way, however. (Please  urlLink e-mail me  if you would like to be an extra. We can set up an internet server and use Teamspeak.)  God damn these terrible moths. God damn them.
