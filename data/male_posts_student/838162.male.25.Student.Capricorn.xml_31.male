Over the last two days, I’ve witness with some amusement the last minute shopping rush that always takes hold this time of the year. However it seems like this year the rush is even greater and not just in the shopping centers and malls. Online shopping rates jumped again since Thanksgiving. Would look like more and more people are turning to online shopping as a way to beat the rush. I think that the delivery service that these online stores provide is the key selling point. They would even wrap and decorate the gift for you. Very useful if you can’t wrap for nuts.  Kinda makes one wonder why there isn’t any good and established online retailer here? Most likely because the market is small and filled with already established big name brick  mortar retailers. So I guess the best way to go is for these retailers to set up their own website to conduct e-shopping services and to provide delivery.  You will have to forgive me. My new course modules have just begun and one of which is on Electronic Commerce technology, therefore I have been thinking in this areas as of late. It also doesn’t help that I don’t seem to be in the Christmas spirit this year. One would think that I would be jumping around in a red suit since this is the first Christmas where I Don’t have to wear green. But with the things in my life of late, it seems that I’m back to wearing blue.  However the tide is changing. I think I’ve been putting myself low for far too long. If there is any occasion to rise myself up, now is the time. Hmm perhaps it’s not too late to regain that Christmas Spirit and do some Window shopping.  *Grins*     Merry Christmas Eve everyone and all.       >
