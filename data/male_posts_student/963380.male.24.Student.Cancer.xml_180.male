'There is no commercial application for hate,' he said. 'There are some words that advertisers are not going to want to be associated with.'"  It's interesting that there is no commercially application for hate. Does that, intrinsically, make hate anti-capitalist? The ethics of the cold war loom quietly in a question like that. I miss the Russians and their faceless, actionless evil. With the Russians it was all about cold hard cash, it made it easy to understand and simple to digest. With these mid-east terrorists - "I hate you cause God told me to..." - we're not going to see a crumbling of their Berlin wall. It's hard to see a resolution other than a lot of dirty pool and what some might eventually call Genocide(tm). It's hard when the motivation is religious - the base of most religions is faith - therefore the harder you hit them, the more "faith" it generates, they keep fighting, with the odd effect of redoubling their efforts to annihilate the great satan and the defilers. At that point you really haven't got much choice.   I just woke up from another nightmare. Not pleased about that. I got into my (very dusty) car (which I had apparently left unlocked). Two generic looking bullies (wouldn't you hate to be a generic looking bully?) walked up to me and tried to hold the door open, maintaining that this car was theirs. They pointed to the stuff in the back, which clearly wasn't mine. Bewildered, (yeah, that's right, I was fucking bewildered), I was about to turn the car over to them when I pulled some sort of ID card from the dash and realized it was my car. Hilarity ensued as I drove away, with the door open and these two lads attempting to dislodge me from my seat. Through the streets of San Fransico (what... the... Fuck??) I was being punched and pinched, while I in turn attempted to drive them into oncoming traffic and drop them off around corners by the specious application of physics to their feeble frames. My alarm went off before I could free myself of the second bully. I'd like to think he rolled under a garbage truck.  Nobody covets my ride.
