Tonight, Siping and Noah are coming over. We'll probably play some DDR and watch a movie.  Travis cut his hair, and if I can, I'll post a picture of it. For now, I'll just say it's really short. Shockingly so.  Good story: Siping sang along to a techno song - something about "my little butterfly" - at 1:00 AM or so the other night. He was intoxicated. While listening, I zoned out. Moments later I was shocked upon opening my eyes to see Siping and not William Hung. Ok.  Less sooner.
