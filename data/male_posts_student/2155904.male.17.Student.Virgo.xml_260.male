It started out with Tyke going to get gas and return something at Blockbuster at the early call of 11 o'clock.  Quite early indeed.  After that Tyke had a couple of pancakes and played some casino on the laptop.  At 1:30 he went to Amed's court and played bball with Amed, Maniak, and Macaroon.  It was pretty fun and lasted for a good hour to hour and a half.  Not bad for 4 people.  Afterwards they went to 7-11 in Eastgate and DUI joined.  So they got their slurpees and then were sorta perusing the store when the cashier told them they had to come pay for their drinks.  Tyke thought that was a little weird but he went up and paid thinking nothing of it.  Then they all paid and were pretty much walking out when the asshole cashier thought Amed was skipping out without paying.  Amed clearly showed that he had paid and displayed the exact change he got back and everyone else had paid obviously as well, except for Macaroon but he made the valid statement that he had paid with exact change first off.  So then they were pissed at the cashier but they went outside and sat on Macaroon's car and kept on eating and talking when after less than a minute the goddammn fucking asshole cashier came out again and said they had to leave and he just stood there with his gay ass face and his motherfucking retarded head and made them leave.  So they drove over to McDonald's parking lot (right next door) and stood out there and finished eating.  What a dick that guy was.  Tyke even splurged and bought a Milky Way to go along with his slurpee before all the other asshole stuff happened.  He regretted that purchase (even though it tasted oh so yummy good).  The brilliant idea of playing Monopoly was introduced while they were eating and Tyke suggested his house so they all went over there and thus the best night in a while started.  Tyke hadn't played Monopoly in probably a couple of years, at least with a few other people.  It was just such a great game.  A mad bidding war started when DUI got hotels on Park Place and Boardwalk and that ended up making Tyke a very strong competitor with all 4 railroads as well as a monopoly on the light purple lots (St. Charles, etc.).  It continued and got down to Tyke and Maniak being the last two, both with all of the property available built on.  It was basically a rolling war.  And Tyke lost it for a while but managed to gain it back after selling some houses and mortgaging a few properties.  He kept rolling on and on and then got better rolls and stayed in the game.  But by this time they had been playing for almost 4 hours and everyone was whining and they wanted to get dinner so they suspended play when Maniak had about 8k plus assets while Tyke had about 2-3k plus assets.  However, Tyke was on the up again and looking pretty good.  But when outside and getting ready to leave Tyke and Maniak decided they would call it a draw and they shook hands and Tyke congratulated Maniak on a very well played game.  It was the best Monopoly game ever played most likely.  Words cannot describe it.  During the game Kinker called and they are back from state now so he came over.  Then Tyke, Kinker, Amed, and Macaroon all went to JIB for dinner and after that got a poker game going with those guys as well as Fejj, DCups, K-Caj, and Tyronious.  Another big crew.  $10 buy-ins of course.  It was a good day but Tyke had to buy in a second time.  So he was in 20 but ended up cashing out at 12:10 when the last 4 (Tyke, Kinker, Amed, Macaroon) decided to quit.  Tyke came out with a total of $45.  So he was up 25 from his buy in and also was owed 10 by DCups so he really came up 35 from today and thus added 5 to his bank when you subtract the 30 he lost yesterday.  It's actually a lot of confusing math so maybe he is still down from yesterday somehow but who knows.  So yeah, it was a great night.  After it was just Tyke, Kinker, and Macaroon Tyke played some Hoyle on the laptop and showed them how it was pretty cool.  He pretty much struggled getting anything though and lost in the Texas tourney and then did well on the other stuff.  Omaha not that well but decent at the end.  But that was just about everything Tyke did today.  With some graphic detail about the 7-11 guy.  Oh, and Tyke takes Spanish 102 on Tues-Fri at 10:10 in Thompson 209 if that helps anyone ;).
