You can  urlLink see a letter at Human Events  that is being sent to the television stations airing the ad ( urlLink watch it here ).  Two main points of interest the letter: First, not one of those men was a crewmate of Kerry (all his living crewmates support him). Even more seriously, there are  no records  of the "doctor" in the video having actually treated Kerry. We'll see how this develops.
