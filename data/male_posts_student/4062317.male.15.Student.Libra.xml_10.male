But anyway, today I had to go over to my cousin’s house for her birthday. I was a really girly party with make up and stuff, but it wasn’t until today that I realized how "street" she is becoming. She has allot of friends that dress like (well I'll just say they are uncivilized for this purpose). They had thier R&B, rap, monkey music blasting in the backyard that drowned out the movie that I was watching. And I had surround sound and subwoofer! Neways it was wierd beause they inturrupted my movie *expierence* by running down stairs and chanting to watch little BowWow. By this point I couldnt take any more street culture for the day so I turned to my father. Not even by making one gesture he knew what i was thinking. He said to me lets get out of here now. At this moment we bolted for the door and rushed are family home. The whole ride home we were complaining about how much my cousin could really use some good ol' rock music. Anyways since her actual birthday isnt for about a month I think Ill buy her some rock music for her birthday. Hopefully she wont listen to that monkey music anymore.  lates,  Smog
