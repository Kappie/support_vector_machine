"I just found out there's no such thing as the real world Just a lie you got to rise above", Mayer sings...what does that have to do with me you wonder. Well In my last post I believe i touched on the idea i sort of have that my life isnt real at all, that its just a movie.. Well have you ever thought that perhaps what you thought was the real world was nothing but a generically created atmosphere that you've been drawn into thinking is real because you've been part of it for so long? Sometimes i wonder...here's why: It seems that my life follows certain patterns for certain things, like when someone does something bad to me, something bad happens to them shortly after automaticallyl; something i'm not the cause of. If you were the movie producer and I was a character in your movie, wouldn't the viewers love for things to be bittersweet, ya know, in america, somehow the good guy always wins? Yeah.. Ever drive under a street light and have it turn off and on??? Well become me, then you'll notice it more often, since it happens too much? Oh and of course theres me being psychic. Now at first read all you fuckers will smirk at that, as if its a joke..due to what you see on TV. Well you are part right in doing that, since what you see on TV is a JOKE..its to make money, its bullshit. I have proof, people will vouch for things i've predicted.  It's not like i look into a fucking crystal ball and see things will happen, but things come to me in a variety of ways.. First, sometimes i Do  see things..those types of predicitons come to me in the form of imagination almost.  Picture yourself dazing off into space in class. Well at times i've "dazed off" and then just random things filled my head, some of which WERE just imaginations, but others have come true. I've told people when i've seen things.. i usually tell one person to be safe just so that if it DOES happen, i have someone to vouch for me.  The other form the predictions come in is kinda weird to understand.  I'll just be talking, and something random will come out, something not part of my concious thoughts; and it will happen out of nowhere. There is no set time when i get either type of prediction coming to me, i can't turn it on and off, and normally i cant tell the difference between the first type of prediction i have and imagination unless it really comes true. Messed up huh? Well yeah, pretty much but go ahead and tell the people who have been witness to this shit that its a lie or i'm nuts(ok well i AM nuts but thats besides the point).  Anyway...sometimes i joke about me being able to read ahead in the script, that is, the script of life..as if the "Director" has allowed me to do so...there are some things I JUST KNOW and I don't know why I know them.  Perhaps there is a director...  Whether life is a movie or something else, theres a chance that its not real, bottom line and I like exploring that idea. "So the good boys and girls take the so called right track Faded white hats Grabbing credits Maybe transfers They read all the books but they can't find the answers"  Well if life isnt real, then think about it, theres no right or wrong answers, everything just changes based on your choice. Usually when things don't turn out right, people usually refer to have made a mistake, but thats only because of the result. Had something good happened, its most likely because of the end result. If thats the case, why do i spend my time worrying about being good and doing the right thing...who the fuck says anything is the right thing...it may all be relative to the individual..is there really an absolute? Also, people spend their whole life looking for answers, asking why why why to everything that happens. But why ask why..it happened and theres nothing you can do. Is there really an answer at all? Why look for one? FUCK IT "They love to tell you Stay inside the lines But something's better On the other side" thats right..there is something waiting for you on the other side, who can say if its better, or worse,but you have to take chances, seek what you do not know..ALWAYS take the chance, you can't lose something you don't have. "I am invincible As long as I'm alive" Everything in the world has a gain and a loss.  As long as you have your life, nothing can take it away except death. Don't live for death, live while youre alive..live for the sake of living.  Ok enough about life being a movie and all that..though i try my best to think that life isnt real, sometimes things happen to make it feel so real. It sucks alot because it seems like my "real life" problems are more complicated than anyone elses.  I usually have no problem solving anyone elses problems through advice and stuff, but no one ever has answers for me.. i'm fucking superman..gotta be the leader, wear a smile and not let whats bothering me really affect me, but sometimes even everyone's hero runs into something equivalent to kryptonite...sometimes i'm weak(though i dont usually show or admit it) and i need some help, but no one can usually help this hero. I'm usually stuck picking my self back up and continuing off and being a superhero to someone else.  Its a good thing i'm a strong person, who else will save the world? lol I'm sure some payoff will come for me..where i'll get mine..and until that day comes, i'll do my best to stay as sane as possible.   For right now i'm done talking about stuff, maybe i'll have more to write later, but until then.... umm cant think... fuck it
