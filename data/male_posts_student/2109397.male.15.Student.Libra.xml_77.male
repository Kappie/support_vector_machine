All these soccer tryouts are coming up which I'm not looking forward to because tryouts suck basically. I'm trying out for United and MAYBE Mockingbird, I haven't made up my mind yet. But the only way I would play Mockingbird would be:  1. If I got cut from United (which I am told is unlikely but who knows right, I mean I was supposed to make Ballard too.)  2. If me and Derek make the team and I am guaranteed by Mockingbird that I would be the only goalie on that team.   You see Mockingbirds B team is a division lower than us, and I would never make their A team (THE ONE WE BEAT AT STATE) so thats my reasoning behind both of my reasons.  Tripp wants me to tryout for Oldham County but after the gamesmanship they showed in our 2nd and even 1st game I would never ever want to be on their team.  So theres the soccer stuff, once its all over its off to soccer camp which shant be too bad, fun almost.   Then theres Ballard tryouts so we shall see what shall happen.  Found a good song called Tom Sawyer by Rush. It rules.
