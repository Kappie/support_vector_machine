The guest star is  urlLink DJ Hell  and although I'm not too much into this kind of music, I'd better move my ass from home or else it's gonna get too big :) It's important to get out with your friends even if you diverge with their taste in music. PS. It's important to get out with your loved ones as well, and if you are not the getting-out type, you are going to have troubles, trust me.
