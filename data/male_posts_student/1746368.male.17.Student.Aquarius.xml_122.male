I don't know what is going on, but I would like to. A whole morning I feel sick, then in an hour of sleep, I feel fine. My throat hurts, I am coughing a lot and I almost lost my voice, but that is the extant. Right now my throat just feels a little hoarse. I wish something would happen to stop this.  Anyways, my day at school was pretty cool. It was nothing special, just nothing horrible. @)!($*!@ what the heck? my shift key doesnT WORK
