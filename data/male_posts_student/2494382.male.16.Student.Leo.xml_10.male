WOW WE ARE FINALLY DONE WITH sCHOOL!!!!!! now i only have to real 3 friggen books this summer... wow that sucks balls. So, last night we lost another soccer game to Eagen 3-1. and the last two times we played them we tied, so i am just getting pissed at soccer cause we cant find a way to scome together and win. THen after soccer a bunch of peoples came to da CLUB shaggin. that would've been a good time if i wernt in a bad mood. We did play this ineresting game that invloved taking off an item of clothing if you drew a lower card then everyone else. All i have to say is i admire clair stringers courage in actually playing the game limke a player and setting an example for the rest of us to follow. someone who will remained nameless quit in the game casue she was "scared" of removing items of clothing. wow who does that?  anyways, the MTV video awards are on tonight and we should all get pumped cause a dimalicious dime is hosting it, named lindsey lohan.  GOOD SONG- Pump it up by Joe Budden
