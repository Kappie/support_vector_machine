Meaning less time on the computer.But she is still my sister. Life at home has been so boring without you. It has been four months since I last saw my sis. Phew! Time passes by very fast. I still can remember the day i sent her off at the airport. As if it was yesterday.  Anyway today is my sister's birthday. How ironic rite?  Happy birthday sis.
