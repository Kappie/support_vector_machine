Hearing his voice makes me wanna cuss. He’s so tone deaf, But he’s hittin’ the charts Like a star! Yeah, baby!  Well, if radio plays his CD’s, I’m gonna turn that damn thing off! I’ll let them know They lost a lis’ner. That boy just can’t sing! It’s so aggravating!   CHORUS: He sucks, he sucks! Oh, baby, Yes, he stinks, he stinks! I’ll go crazy If I hear that Hong Konger sing just one more note, I’m gonna go and slash his throat! He sucks, he sucks! I’m pissed off by the way he sings! Can’t sing! No one ever had a voice Like his, So, I’m gonna boycott stations playing him, I’ve got no choice.   William Hung, He’s just bad news. I’d like to hit him with my old shoes! Why don’t that William Hung go home And shut up? Yeah, baby!  Well, if you ask me, his voice is a crime, And he should be locked up for life! He came here to study engineering, But he’s no singer, So unendearing!
