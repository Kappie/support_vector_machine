Kohler was there though with his lady friend. he needed someone to put his bearings on his board so i did. then i used it to go to Simon's place. he had quite a few people over, more than i thought he was going to have. they all played texas hold'em and i'm not much of a card guy so i headed back to Fruitcake's place. when i got there, not many people were awake and those who were, were going to go hotbox Fruitcake's car. definitely not something for me. so i headed back to Simon's place. eventually everybody left to where it was just me, Simon, and TYRONE. we had a very cool talk about things. it was very good. then we went driving around. that was...eh. then i slept. that is my summary of last night. enjoy.
