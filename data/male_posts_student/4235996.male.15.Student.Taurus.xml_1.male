And like he got hit right in his chest(me thinking he is dead chucked a nad at another guy not knowing the guy I shot didn't die) so bye then I was dead. Hoping my nad dropped before I was killed I waited but nothing happened, then about a minute after I died this guy walked over my dead body I I heard an explosion(I was in my room getting a pen and paper) I ran in and at the top of my TV it said ,GSG-9 MAGNUM(me) fragged ******(don't remember) with an m67 and I was like what the fuck. And I won the round for my team. THAT'S F.U.B.A.R.(Fucked Up beyond All Recognition)
