And that’s the way I want it to be.  Not I, nor those close to you Deserve this type of abuse We’re not goin to take it, Not from you! It’s not on me That you are screwed In the head and in the heart Take your living, and  Do the opposite of start.   You’ve been bad. You’ve been good. Did you lose your mind like I knew you would? Can you bleed? Can you cry? I hope you bleed when you lose your feet, And go tumbling off the edge! Thankfully nothing’s left. Will you go tumbling like I know you should?  Not I, nor those close to you Deserve this type of abuse We’re not goin to take it, Not from you! It’s not on me That you are screwed In the head and in the heart Take your living, and  Do the opposite of start.   Tumble, tumble down. Don’t stop when you hit the ground Go on down to six feet under. Better hurry now! Cause I’m sinking closer  To putting you under!  You’ll be there with the rats and rodents Sounds like describing your components I hope you rot in hell you crazy bitch. Hurry home, but don’t forget to Crash your car into a ditch! Rid us all of your infecting life Lack the respect?, and I’ll gladly use the knife.  Not I, nor those close to you Deserve this type of abuse We’re not goin to take it, Not from you! It’s not on me That you are screwed In the head and in the heart Take your living, and  Do the opposite of start.   It’s not on me That you are screwed In the head and in the heart Take your living, and Do the opposite of start!    here ends the love making session
