An article where the Elder George Bush shows disagreement with his son's penchant for war, and it doesn't get the slightest mention in national news.  Well done, American news media!  Rather than give me two sides of a coin, you play the game Bush Jr. asks and tell me  urlLink Iraq has more weapons , even though they consist of a drone plane similar to the one the UN used over America after September 11, and cluster bombs that could hold biological agents.  Unfortunately, it is evident they also could not hold biological agents, considering the ones we used in Afghanistan didn't.    I know I said no war.  NO WAR.  So today I'm pointing out the flaws of the unabashed trust we put into the local or national news.  We treat the news media like we treat God; their word is The Word, because why would they lie?  I understand about God, but if you believe in God, aren't you not supposed to deitize MSNBC?
