(pictures of complete soccer fields) Google (autopictures) AltaVista (fairy tale jokes) Google (noah was an albino?) Google (george bush is jesus) by the way this came from a standford.edu IP MSN (2004/05/29) Google (meave blog -leakey)  To Maeve: I thought the last search might've been mine because of the spelling, but I have no recollection of searching for "-leakey".
