New technology is changing the face of computer. I believe that computer in the future, maybe 1000 years from now will be so advanced that they will change our way of living. Computer will do most of the work. Most of the systems in the world will be planned, made and controlled by computers. Computer will be advance and be able to do so much more. I don’t even know where to start explaining what computers can do.
