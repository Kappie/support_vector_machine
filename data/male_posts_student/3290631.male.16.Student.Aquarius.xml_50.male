I can notice that difference, and if I can notice it, my teachers can too.  I am just such an amazing procrastinator.  I find myself just hanging around the tv all day or just being on the internet all night.  I don't want to work so hard to the point that it sucks up my life like some kids, I just want to feel like I'm  doing  my work.  So today, I'm gonna start working hard again.
