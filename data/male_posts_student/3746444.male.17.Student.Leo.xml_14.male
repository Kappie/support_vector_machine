But the worst part is I have so many  things to say that just cant be put down on the computer or anywhere else. its weird I have them all going through my head at the same time and probaly have redun this one insert about three times. I just dont know. I just cant wait until school starts up to actually see some friends again. And talk to the ones I most desired to actually sit down and talk to besides going on the computer and typing what we want to say. But........ Damn this alcohol just makes me blab and blab doesn't it. Oh well you still have to read it Brandi Hahahahahahaha. Well to get to the point no matter what the case just call me if you need anything and the last time you called my phone didn't ring. No, I'm serious. NO. I really do mean it. Well I love you and hope to see you soon or call me whenever.
