Being doin' nothing for the past three hours, with simply dilly and dally by my side.  I wonder what surprises awaits me tomorrow? Is it just a normal day, a horrid one or one that would be happily unforgettable? Or one that would made me behave in a pussilaneous way? Life is short, so is peace. All the more we should not delay what we deem to do right to the next morning.  Hahahaha....that was so damn philosophical rite? It's so crazy to write in such Shakespearan way. ((But I like 1500s to 1600s England anyway~~)) Thinking back of the history syllabus taken at the A levels, it is clear that this is not the kind of history that I can put my best effort in. The best history would be to study Europe's history beginning from 1453 to 1972. And by the way, the year 1453 is the fall of the last Roman empire or better known as the Byzantine Empire. That's when the fairly modern history of Europe started.  My computer's jammin' up and I have no idea what is causing such a thing. It's either the virus within this computer or the Overnet downloader that I'm using. One thing I would like to use on the computer is to simply take a hammer and slam it down onto my motherboard so that it will 'contain' the problem instantly. But, this is kinda' stupid so I would not do such a crazy and impractical way to solve problems.   Strange...why am I writin' such non-sensical stuff today? Perhaps...the 'whore' element in me is rising up and 'causing Mr Alvin Tan to change into a whore + slut. Okok...maybe I'm thinkin too much. [Quote with courtesy of Miss MJ from YJC.]  Well...what was I supposed to write about then? Hmmm....typed several stupid quizzes given by mu-ryou friends in friendster...which is kinda' corny too. And I wonder why people do not write long blogs too....shouldn't these cyber stuff be rather lengthy too? Good example --> http://xiaxue.blogspot.com/; and I'm so surprised that there are so many people called Alvin Tan...especially of all shape  sizes too.....with courtesy of Google of course, and not forgetting Yahoo! as well.  Okay...too much body fluid is flying out of the giant opening located at the front of my head. It's time to say goodbye....GOODBYE FOR NOW! Wishing myself all the best in the upcoming History Quiz for tommorow~~!!!
