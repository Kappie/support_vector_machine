I have a dear friend named Kendra who apparently believes in immortality. Immortality: A belief that you can live forever, physically or otherwise. Immortality can be achieved by being an icon, a hero, heck! Even a pornstar! But this particular immortality I am talking about is The Immortality of Chickens.  Perhaps an explanation is in order.      Chickens, like humans have their purpose on earth. However, chickens are food and they are eventually reduced to human poop. But Kendra The Chicken believes in immortality. She wants to be an icon, one way or another. She wants to leave a dent in this world. Maybe as the chicken who worked for an internet cafe. Maybe as the chicken who one-wayed a gorgeous guy because her "chickeness" got the better of her, or maybe she wants to be the first chicken to be a dominatrix in high heels.      She abhors the movie Chicken Run primarily because the movie revolves around chickens running for their lives. This particular chicken who is the precise equivalent of the Virgin Mary professes a moral discomfort with the murders of poor chickens everywhere. She bitches about the fact that dismembered chicken limbs are sold freely in the goddamn supermarket. "Thats just obscene!" She said. She was on the verge of going homicidal and she wanted to snatch the butcher's knife and dismember his penis.  Now, basking in the spotlight is my very dear friend Kendra, who believes in chicken rights and chicken immortality.
