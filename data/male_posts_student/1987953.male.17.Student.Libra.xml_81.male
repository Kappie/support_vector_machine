I get to see Kari again after 2 years, and Jess after two months. I am so excited to see Kari! It's been so long!!!! We've been so close so long, and now we can finally see each other again.   Anyway, not much is really going on. It's getting sort of ridiculous that nothing is going on.    I am about 2-3 weeks from my license. I've gotten a lot of driving time in (including taking my car for a ride without my parents- shh! Don't tell anyone I broke the law, okay?), and I'm almost there.   Also, I don't want to spill the beans, so I won't give it away yet, but something new and exciting should happen in my life soon, if God so wills. It's not that spectacular or anything, nothing that hasn't happened before, but you know...  Anyway, that's all for now. Comment about stuff. I promise I'll get back to blogging!  In Christ, Mike >
