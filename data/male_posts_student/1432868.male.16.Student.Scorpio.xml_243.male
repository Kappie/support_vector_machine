In less positive news my grades are still looking dismal despite my resolution to bring them back up. I'm just gonna have to try harder, get some help I guess. It's just a matter of pride to some extent. I have written 3 very crappy essays for english thus far...so that needs to improve before the final test NEXT monday, Music Theory is next Wednesday, and World is on the 28th.  also more of a reminder to self then anything else Laura owes me 3 bucks and Ron owes me 1.50.
