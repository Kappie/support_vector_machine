They continue to charge insane long distance rates in the face of free long distance cellular, and are slow to adopt new ideas.  I guess this is another case where they want to stop progress through litigation.  I don't know the merits of their lawsuit, but Paypal has been around a very long time (in internet terms).  It would seem to me that AT would have moved in a long time ago if they were truly concerned about damages.
