On a brighter note (yes, not kidding), I just checked out my horoscope for today:   (Capricorn) Your personal thermostat is turned all the way up, which can only mean one thing:  passion . You'll see it in everything you do and hear it in every word you speak. You won't be the only one!   Therefore, tomorrow, I'm going to be   passionate   about learning! And see what it says? I won't be the only one! (Horoscopes are never wrong). Kickass, who wants to   sizzle   with me over some Pre-Cal? Mmm... oh baby, I'm hot just thinking about it.   Ok, I realize some of you may say that the horoscope won't apply since it's actually for today. But since I'm not reading tomorrow's, this one is going to carry over. So screw you. Hah.
