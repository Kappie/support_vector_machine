It started this morning at the Wimbleton Womens finals when 13th seeded  urlLink Maria Sharapova  beat first seeded Serena Williams.  (In related news, I'm dumping Janel Moloney.  Maria's closer to my age anyway.)  Also unusual, Nathan watching an two entire sporting events ( I also watched Roddick vs Ancic).  Tennis is severely underated.   After that I successfully made an egg that wasn't scrambled.  A little while later we played hearts. Jonah and I each shot the moon, and I wasn't even trying to till I was nearly there.  Jonah got incredibly lucky at all points in the game.  After that we heard thnat the general assembly gay and lesbian ordination motion only failed by four votes, which is probably the most amazing thing.  Then we went outside and got caught in a terrible freak rainstorm.  Lots of weird stuff keeps happening.  It'll be worse by the end of the day, mark my words   Ouch! A ferret is beating me about the shins!
