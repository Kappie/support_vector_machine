He thought that he shouldn't hang out with us "little kids" that much 'cos people might think weird. I talked to him about it and told him that all that matters is what GOD thinks and not what other people think. He was just concerned about losing his friends because they think it's weird that he does this. Blah... I think he's a cool dude. Like, a brother in Christ. I love RHCBC~ My family! ^^ Everybody's so friendly and stuff. I love 'em all~ Brothers and sisters, uncles and aunties. My 2nd mom, Auntie Amy~ Haha~ Oh well. I just hope he'll be okay. It'd be a bummer if he didn't hang out with us anymore because of his friends. Blah... PUSH~ whoever's reading this, pray for Jay~ That GOD will help him through this and stuff.   Went on Friendster a bit and added Zoe, IngiEE, Sara, Katie, Alice, Roger, Martin, Jay, Eliot, and a lot of other people. HahazZ~! Funness!  I miss Nima... Can't stop thinking of him. *sighzZ* Hope he doesn't get sick... *sighzZ* Nima... I love you... and I just worry...
