It has recently been brought to my attention that I look like a stereotypical stoner (actually this has been going on for quite some time but that’s beside the point).  I’d just like to point out that even if a person has long hair, wears sunglasses a lot, and has a tendency to say trippy a little more then is necessary does in no way mean that he is a stoner.  So if you are at a movie or at the mall or anywhere for that matter don’t go up to the guy and ask for some weed.  You know why? BECAUSE HE DOESN’T HAVE ANY!!!!!  Nothing ruins your day with your friends more then having some jittery, red eyed, sniffing, half freaking out creep coming up to you and saying “Hey man do you got a joint?”  Like come on people do I look stupid enough to do that stuff??  It’s just the kind of thing that makes me want to punch a person out.  And to top it all off even my parents think this too so now I have to deal with them going through my room.  So what I say is, “you want some weed? Well piss off!!” -Matt
