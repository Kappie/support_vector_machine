Me and my other beautiful sister Nina were sent to a friend of the family's as my mother gave birth to Che.....I'll never forget that day....my baby sister who has already gotten a perfect score on her math SAT, skipped a grade, been a student at GA governor's honors program, and gotten a presidential scholarship at Spelman is 18 today....  Next year on Feb. 9th my beautiful, charismatic sister Nina will turn 21....Nina knows me better than anyone else....I have spent more time with Nina than anyone else....I admire her so much....sometimes we argue but there isn't a single person on Earth I'd rather have on my side than Nina....  If you put Nina and Che in the same room the first question that gets asked invariably is if they are twins....and the way they work together you would think they are....they take notes for one another about various events....they have codewords and special slang about different people we know....in short they make a perfect team....sometimes I feel like a priviledged outsider when I watch them interact....the week they came up to visit me is easily the best week of this very terrible year so far....I can't wait till they come back next month!  Days like today really cause me to sit back and reflect on how blessed I am....Happy Birthday lil Che Che!!!.....your big brother is proud of you!
