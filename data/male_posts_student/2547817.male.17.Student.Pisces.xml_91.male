Everyone wasn't afraid to do what was necessary to get the job done, including karmasutra poses.  The cast was almost perfect in appearance. Perfect looking school for perfect looking people. All the girls were very pretty. Course, it could have been the make up. But really, WOW!  Blocking was fine. Articulation was reasonable, but I felt that some characters displayed too little emotion. Also, there were a few technical glitches and spacial errors. There were a few bumps and smacks here and there... Some lines were fumbled with but promptly picked up. They have to work on their projection technique though. Whilst trying to incorporate suttle emotion into speeches, they become inaudible.  On the whole, I'd give it a 7.9
