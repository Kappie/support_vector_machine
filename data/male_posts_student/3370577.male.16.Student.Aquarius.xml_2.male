And the honest truth is, I should have set my expectations lower. Walking Tall is in fact a remake of a 1970's action flick starring Joe Don Baker as a returning soldier named Pusser. Sound like a recipe for disaster? Yeah, it get's better. Joe Don's character will be reprised by none other than bulky meat-slab The Rock. Now, don't get me wrong, The Rock does possess potential acting talent (he was quite good in The Rundown), but if he wants me to take him seriously, he needs to get a real name.   The Rundown starts out okay, as The Rock's character returns to his hometown and is reunited with his family and friends. And surprise, a casino opened up while you were gone and now the town's a wretched hive of scum of villiany. Sorry about that. The Rock, of course, beats up a bunch of guys because the dice at the casino are loaded. And they take an exacto knife and cut him up. But hey, the only thing chicks dig more than muscles are scars, right Rock?   Nah, he decides to grab a two-by-four and beat up some  more  guys. Then he is proclaimed innocent at court and elected sheriff... now, at this point in the movie, I started thinking that maybe this wasn't the most believable flick. It gets worse.  Once he becomes sherrif, the Rock fires everyone else on the force and elects his dumb "comic-relief" buddy to be his only deputy. After engaging in more ridiculous, highly-illegal actions, the Rock beats up some more guys... and that's when I stopped paying attention.  Walking Tall is quite possibly the dumbest, most violent-for-no-reason, ridiculous movie I've seen all year. Every scene is a mockery of the police force. In stead of watching a prisoner like he should be doing, the Rock starts making out with his girlfriend because she brings him some tupaware with potato salad inside. Now guess what, your car exploded and they're standing outside the office with machine guns.  Now, it helps a bit that the bad guys in this movie have such terrible aim that they hit everything except the Rock, and that the Rock is able to shoot and kill people he can't see through walls, but it'll still be a tough fight, right? Not really. I never feel like the Rock is really in danger. He's three times as big as any guy in this movie, and could easily take five or six of them with no problem. I never feel sympathy for any of these characters.  And so many potential plot points are totally forgotten. The relationship with his troubled nephew is completely disregarded halfway through the movie, and the Rock's past military woes are only hinted at and then forgotten. I feel like the filmmakers just got lazy.  Take my advice, rent the original Walking Tall. It's Joe Don Baker's only good movie, so give him a break. If you're itching for some Rock action, watch The Rundown. But you're not missing much of anything if you don't see Walking Tall.
