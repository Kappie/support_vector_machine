Yeah..we are leading two very busy lives, and hardly even have time to chat with each other. The only lnk between us is our blogs. HaHa. Yeah.. I miss her too what. I also feel quite guilty leh..like I am the last to know everything that happened to her. Yeah. Like not really being there for her (like I got help like that! HAHA! I always don't know how to say the rights things de la). Yeah...Ayiah, I am crapping la. So, yeah... I miss Wendy too, just so you know.  Yeah. That Tham ar! I don't find him cute anymore. He hor! He's dissappointed with our class la. For this week, he suddenly did a 360-degrees change! He became totally cold towards our class..and our class only lor. This is like ergh. I hate maths lessons this week. They are so cold! Brr! He hor, also very guo fen leh. Dissappointment is one thing. Targetting our group is another. He got mad at us and shouted lor. Like, what the heck! We all figured that he's mad because GekLing and her group isn't performing up to his standard..the same thing goes for the class. He isn't being professional like that leh...wearing his emotions on his sleeves when he teach. Ergh!   Er...what to comment? I dunnoe what to say le. Ayiah...mainly I am blogging so late. I think I end this blog with these two big events la. Yeah. So see ya next time! Night blog! TaTa!
