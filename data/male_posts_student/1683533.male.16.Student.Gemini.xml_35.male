Their album is pure genius music-wise.  When I first got the CD I mainly listened to "Swing, Swing" and I saw them as mediocre musicians.  I told that to Ben a few months ago, and he laughed.  Then I listened to the whole CD...I went behind all the normal stuff and there are so many small tiny additions...timpanis...chimes....and they fit in perfectly....When I first got the CD I listened to a song like Track 8 and then skipped it cause it just had an acoustic guitar going and it seemed boring.  But if I was a little more patient and waited for the other stuff to come in, I would find out that this was a very good song.  Sure, many of their songs have very simple guitar riffs, but simple doesn't mean suck.  Some people don't realize that.  Having complicated music doesn't make you any better.  A simple riff could be an extremely musical experience when put together with other simple parts.  The second track on their CD is a fantastic song yet the guitar is so simple to play.  The bass line is also easy, but extremly addicting in the begining.  Some people are so ignorant to never look behind the fuckin lyrics.  It's called MUSIC for a reason.... THERE IS MUSIC IN IT ...If you want to be amazed by lyrics and such goto a free form poetry club where they bang on bongos and say very deep poems that barely anybody can understand.... LISTEN BEHIND THE WORDS TO THE MUSIC.   2. Just cause they are crybabies doesnt make their their lyrics suck.  Not only are there music good, but some of the metaphors and sayings in the lyrics are so deep they boggle my mind.  Sure they are bitching about lost loves and such, but they change how they say it from other bands by making it extremly deep.  I am a songwriter myself (I write much of the lyrics to the punk/ska/ and maybe some emo band, Just For You[not that the other boys in the band don't do any work...they are very good musicians themselves and edit much of my songs and we make them sound better])....anyways...I am a song writer myself and I wish I could begin to write as the All-American Rejects write their lyrics....I mean fuck...they are good...here are some examples  * Please speak slowly, my heart is learning, teach me heart ache stop this burning...   Too Far Gone   * Your lips are a shelter for the things I don't know   Too Far Gone   * one boy, one girl, two hearts their world, time goes by,secrets rise, one more sad song, tears shed she's gone, she'd take it back if she only could, and all the perfect words they seem so wrong  she's gone,  you wish you could learn to see,  the door is closed and you wish you could be, alone with you alone with me   One More Sad Song   * please just dont play with me,  my paper heart will bleed,  this wait for destiny won't do, be with me, please, I beseech you, Simple things, that make you run away, Catch you if I can   My Paper Heart   * So bottle up old love, And throw it out to sea, Watch it away as you cry.    My Paper Heart   Sure, they aren't the best lyrics...but they are still really good...I mean...I wish I could write lyrics like that...'cept about other things besides broken hearts and such...these guys could be poets...  Well, that's why you shouldn't hate the All-American Rejects for being crybabies....love hurts alot of the time in my opinion...so if you don't think they should be bitching about it, then you probably never experienced it.   No lyrics this time cause there are plenty in the rant I just wrote
