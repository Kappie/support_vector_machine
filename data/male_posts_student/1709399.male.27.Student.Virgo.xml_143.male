Also in most cases I don't know how to say no and end up taking too many responsibilities and over-working myself. Suddenly over the last few days I have been busy as hell . I have taken a few additional responsibilities at my workplace and have been fighting hard to find time to balance everything. Its good in a way that my time gets utilized properly (with little idle time)  my productivity increases. But then I have a feeling that Life is leading me rather than I leading my life.                                         I remember John Lennon's (Beatles) famous quote " Life is what Happens to you when you are busy making other plans".
