Less depressed than last night, actually, I can say without a lie leaving my mouth (nor my fingers =P ) that I'm actually happy,  and  hopeful! Added bonus eh?  While I'm typing this, my internet connection has been on for 1 day, 4 hours, and 8 seconds =P I forgot to turn it off last night when I fell asleep waiting for Cowboy Bebop to go on TV (in Cartoon Network's  Adult Swim , who would've known =P ), and so far 'Saturday Afternoon Fever' (a funny little animation from a guy at VFS), two trailers for 'Sky Captain and the Day After Tomorrow' (looks very promising, love the retro 30's style, and the guys at RSP.com.au are doing the graphics =P ), downloaded a few TV themes, updated (and added) a few people to my Examples folder, and am in the process of refreshing my 3Dnspiration issues (online magazine for 3D peeps).  So, yeah... It's all good   Art  Today, I've spent a lot of time redoing some of my old projects, like cleaning up some aliasing on my weekend challenge for Atlantis (the link below will have updated, and it's nothing major, my little nit picks) But, more recently, I have rejuvenated...  PEDRO!  Pedro's, I guess an oldish man, which I made in 3D. One of my first wades into the organic realm on my lonesome, and all my concept too. Here for your enjoyment is the good old man himself,  PEDRO!  =P     I have a sketch of him, which I used in initial construction, but in an artistic sense it's pretty hideous, so it's not linked here =P   I also need to find a project to become dedicated too soon, or I'll go mad... Getting a project makes you focus your creative energy, and it'll make you work until you can get it right, because it means something to you... Like Sormann's  urlLink ThemePark World ! It is one of the funniest concepts I've seen, something to keep an eye on =P   Inspiration  This one isn't really a long winded, heavily articulated one, merely a few brim ideas... I got this idea while getting my sketchbook out of my bag, while mum was asleep infront of the TV on the couch, and my dog was asleep too... My dog woke up, so I quietly put him back to bed. When I finished grabbing my sketchbook, I noticed I didn't have my small lamp, and didn't want to turn on the large light, so I snuck back across the lounge room into the corridor and finally into my bedroom to claim the lamp... After having a quick duel with my Lord of the Rings Return of the King poster, I snuck down quietly in the dark and begin the tedious task of finding which cord was the lamp's. When I finally found it, I yanked it out, only to find it was the wrong one, nabbit... Then, I finally found the one, and softly pulled, as if worried a giant spark'll leap out and engulf me. That was when I got the idea. What about an extremely successful thief, of extreme expertise, who is in the middle of a project. He's sorting out which is what, and finally thinks hes got it, when the most unlikely situation arises and he is caught (even though it's not his fault). He ends up working for the people who caught him, probably the government, and ends up meeting a 'baddie', who, in his words 'You can't steal the planet!' "Exactly, that's why I don't want anyone else to have it...", ie, this baddie is the kind who blows up anything he can't have, ie, the world =P I can imagine it now, episode one is introducing the main thief, working his way into a top secret facility, hiding among the shadows while people run past (have him slink into the shadows, and have 2D cutouts with a projected shadow onto the ground/wall run past), and finally getting caught unexpectedly, with the last shot being the alarms starting to go off and the look of complete disbelief (I mean, really, he's an experienced thief, but part of that experience is having  never gotten caught ! He doesn't know how to react! lol) Episode 2, introduction to the 'Justice Gang' I guess it's the policeish guy who basically plots him against all evil, fire against fire sort of thing, and probably the good old nerd like Nigel (sp?) off of Alias! WooT WooT! (can have an extra sequence about having the Nigelesque character saying it was his technology that caught the thief, and then after the extremely disconcerning look from the thief, have him splutter something like 'Yes, well, of course, a lot of luck was involved afterall...')  And there are the first two episodes, created in probably less than 30 minutes, in a nutshell =P  Also, for my first animation project I think I'm planning to do a sort of complexified sphere, with arms extruded out and probably two eyes just to add that 'human' factor to it... Something so simple it's gotta work... =P lol I hope to have this animation done by the end of holidays, which will give me three weeks to work on it (and since, as I said in my previous post, I have no plans, it should be pretty easy =P)  Anyway, that shall be the night for me, at least, the night recorded in this journal. I plan to do some odds and ends, and then eventually go to sleep *sigh* and, for the sake of my computer and my ISP, disconnect the bloody internet connection! lol
