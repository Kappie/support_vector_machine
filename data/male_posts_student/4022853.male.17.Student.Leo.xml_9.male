She was everything to me.  I decided to go for a walk at that point.  So its just getting light...and im outside wandering the streets at around 5:30 in the morning.  I then get the bright idea that I may be able to see that wonderful smile of hers once more so I go to her bus stop.  Unfortunately I am unaware of the time having lost my watch at Newton Wave Pool.  So i leave and im back at my house around 6:30.  I am soaked at this point and my friend is passed out on the couch.  Im thinking to myself that if i just stayed a little bit longer i might have been able to see her once more.  Depressed i grab a nice warm bowl of soup and just sit in my back yard and get even more soaked in the cold rain while eating my warm soup.  I thought of her almost the entire time.  Writing this i am still soaked and though my mind may be weary, i still wonder if things could have been different...I always keep a faint bit of hope with me.
