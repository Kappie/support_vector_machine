So I was watching MTV Jams while eating some Turkey Spaghetti yesterday (I cook for myself, yay!....I'm half a functional adult!!) and it appears that Master P has for some unknown reason has decided to REMAKE BOUT IT, BOUT IT....now a bit of trivia for those who maybe didn't know...the version of Bout it, Bout it that came out in 1996 was Part II, making this new version with "The Diplomats" (I am tempted to make an immunity joke....I'm so corny... I know) unofficially part III....but anyways I can't  really get mad about it or say that I am surprised....I mean we are talking about Master P here....ugh....  Anyway that's enough non-studying...time to hit the books hard for a few hours....
