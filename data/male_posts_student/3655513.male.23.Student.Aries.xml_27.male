I didn't celebrate the holiday of the birthing of my nation, paint my face red, or even proceed to the top floor of my apartment building with the other residents in order to catch a glimpse of the fireworks being launched from the Canadian Olympic Park that lies just a little distance to the west of me. Instead I partied the night before at a cool little club downtown (and did cheer in the rolling over to midnight as a matter of fact, midnight of course signifying Canada Day) then I slept in, cleaned my apartment and played my current video game of choice (Final Fantasy XI). With this quasi-anti-patriotic churning down in the bowels of my very existence, I find myself waiting for the end of my work day so I can celebrate something else this weekend.  I'm ready to celebrate the summer.  Being a student, and someone who is involved in various aspects of life (my church, my friends, my job) I find between September and April to be ridiculously busy. No free time, and if I squeeze some personal time in somewhere, it is because I am putting something else off. Well from May to August that is different. Aside from working 8 hours a day, and a night or so a week with my youth group or my worship team, I am largely commitment free. That means tonight, as I go out to BBQ and hottub, I can do so guilt and worry free. I will come home, stay up late watching a movie perhaps, then pass my saturday away playing video games or something.  Ain't life grand?  Shalom.  Rooster
