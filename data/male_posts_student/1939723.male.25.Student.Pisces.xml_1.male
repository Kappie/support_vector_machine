Every trailer and comment in the media was about the same jokes which were not that funny. But since everyone in Germany is going to see this movie and Kerstin and Hoisn wanted to come too, I gave myself a hitch.   Luckily all my fears were gone shortly after the film started. I've never seen such an entertaining movies for a long time and I can recommend it to everyone who is not afraid of gay people ;)    A few days ago I started learning for my math exams and got bored about this pretty quickly. I'm pretty sure that I won't need this stuff again in my future career, but I need this for my diploma *grr*  As a countermeasure against distraction from learning, I forced myself to announce a new release of Luma in two weeks. This means that it's in bugfixing mode now and no new features are allowed to be added. Since all known bugs are fixed, there is nothing interesting I can do :)
