It is a must read (and for Matt, you may be particularly interested in following some of the many links he provides). He poses some very interesting questions. He states pretty early on that he is an atheist (specifically a mechanistic atheist), but then goes on to shape arguments and thought experiments that are challenging to almost anyone.  I'm not a big proponent of thought experiments though. The can definitely be used to refine a definition or a belief, but they don't really serve much practically because they are just that - thoughts, there is generally no way to prove or even physically test a thought experiment. Nevertheless, they make for darned good conversation.  Go forth and read. I'd like to know what you all think. And I bet most of you will be able to guess where I stand and what I think.  I've been reading Steven's blog for a long time, and he has some particularly good analysis of stuff. He's a pretty deep thinker and uses critical thinking skill, logic and debate principles about as well as anyone I've seen. He doesn't post a ton (maybe once or twice a week on average) but when he does it is usually worth reading. I'll probably refer to him again.
