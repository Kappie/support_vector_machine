FUR ELISE!  what the crap is up with that.  fur elise is like so much harder than the song i wanted to learn!  its such a bunch of crap.  and then she was all like oh you're so much better than i was when i was a senior and you're only a sophmore.  the way you can learn music is incredible cuz you do it by ear and you're so much more gifted and blah blah. but i have to teach you the theory."  BUT SHE ALREADY HAS!  now yeah i dont know everything. but i know what she's taught me so far.  and half of that i learned in choir before she taught me.  grrr...it just makes me so mad!  so im just trying to learn the song on my own.  without her help.  it's My Heart Will Go On.  i can play the beginning.  which i think is pretty good.  course i am doing it by ear but she wont teach it to me the right way so what choice do i have?  goodness!  im so ticked.  im gonna go play this song.  adieu.
