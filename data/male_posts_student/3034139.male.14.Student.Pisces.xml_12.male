Today we did no work at school. I rode my bike to school, but it was snowing this morning. Someone took an April Fool's prank too far and put vaseline on the monkey bars, the gliders, and even the handles and brakes of my bike. Our class got an apology letter about it. I think everyone did.  I'm doing a Power Point Presentation for COR (community of readers), in school. My partners are ******  ******,  me. It's coming along really well. We've put some mini-clips and animation on it, and they're really funny.  I don't really have any plans for Spring Break, I'm just going with the flow. I'm going to look at XBoxes over Spring Break. I really want to buy one! I'm also hoping to get better at skateboarding.  That's All Folks!
