That's weird but it's much better than being fat. reconsider your eating habits but make sure that if you start eating again you DONT get fat. I suggest that maybe you go and get some special help and get yourself worked out before you start eating or continue not eating because you may have some serious problem. Anyway, make sure you eat something because your body needs some nutrients! Thanks for taking my quiz and for finding out that you are anarexic!  ---> Now I think tt's totally untrue! I'm not even skinny! I'm juz thin dammit!  The Big Love Test   LOVING ONE. You need  safety in your relationship. You want to  be sure in his/her arms, knowing that he will protect you and you can be totally devoted to your other. At this point you are very vulnerable. You open yourself and dont even think that he/she could cheat you. You totally trust your partner in every single way. SO if you find out that she/he lied to you or played a game this trust is broken. You may try to forgive your other but this will be very difficult.He/She has to be friendly and trustworthy.  ---> Hmmm, now tt sounds true. Seriously, it does. Dun u agree wif me?  What Movie Do You Belong In?   Power Rangers Movie!  ---> Well, I've to admit tt I pretty much agree wif this. *Sighz*  Which Kind of Candy Are You?   You're chocolate.  You're the old soul type, people feel that they have known you their entire life.  Many often open up to you for they view you as thoughtful and trustworthy.  Although people trust you, you have a hard time trusting them.  You prefer to keep your feelings bottled up inside, or display them very quietly.  It is alright to open up every once in a while.  ---> Maybe this is true. I do find it hard trusting others at times. I juz can't find someone tt I can express my feelings to yet.
