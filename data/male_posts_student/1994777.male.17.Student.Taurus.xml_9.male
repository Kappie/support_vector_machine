good set and was pleased with myself.30 by 100m freestyle was painful.but i loved it.this thing about pain is overwhealming me.it's starting to become a drug that i have to live on.i'm probably addicted to it right now.haha!strange don't you think so?coach john said something during training today that had me ponder over the entire training session.he said: i've never come across a 1500m swimmer who doesn't like pain.i was thinking about it the whole time and relised that what he said was so true.we swimmers get alot of time to think of stuff when we swim.especially during sets like 30 by 100m.helps keep us occupied in the water.haha.yeah so back to the question.pain.most swimmers would hate it.but we 1500m swimmers just thrive on it.pain has already become a daily neccessity when we train.i guess we just like to push ourselves to the limit.to see how much our bodies can endure.how do you explain it.lets see.it sort of feelis like you've been punched in the stomach real hard?yeah something like that.and you feel totally breathless.on top of that.your mucles start hardening and you feel like you could take eternity to reach the wall.so thats that for training today. i'll be leaving for thailand tomorrow!and because of this i'm now the number 1 hate figure in the COE (Centre of Excellence).haha!don't worry guys.i'll send you lots of postcards =P so anyway.like i said.i deserved this holiday.its amazing how time actually flys.come to think of it.it was as if it were only yesterday that i was in the examination hall taking my 'o' levels.haha.i'm really glad it's all over now by the way.i'm soon going to start a new chapter in my life when i go to the US to study as well as train for my swimming.i'm really excited about the idea of going overseas.i believe it'll be a worthwhile experience.altough i'm rather reluctant to leave HER behing.*sigh*.oh well.i'll just let fate take over.shall cherish the few months i'm left with.i'll really miss my friends too.mark tan i hope you're reading this.i'm reffering to you.and POK.and a whole lot more.oh.unice is going to BYU (Brigham Young University) too.and guess what!she'll most probably be taking the same course as me!haha.cool isn't it?unice is BIG.right.i shall not comment further in fear of getting whacked.but anyway.unice is training at the COE with us right now.she's sort of struggling i think.but don't worry so much girl.you'll get over it in a couple of weeks time. csc (chinese swimming club) invited me to talk to the A and B groups about life in COE.haha.that should be interesting.haha.oh!i've got to say this.the parents in csc are totally screwed man!not all but a few.its sad that because of these few people the name of csc is being tarnish.yeah.i'm not gonna lie about it.all they do is try to bring you down when you're good.but i've got my ways of shutting them up.so to all you parents who wish to see my downfall.i know who you people are.i'll make sure you idiots won't get a chance at all.=).i don't know why they love to do such things.maybe because they think i'm arrogant?right.let me say this.every swimmer has a big ego.i'm serious.if you don't have a big ego you'll never be able to make it big.i've got a big ego.i don't hide that.but i'm not arrogant.you really don't have to be arrogant to have a big ego.its because of our super huge ego that make good swimmers great.i'm not saying i'm great but i'm trying to get this message across that it's all right to have a big ego.i mean.thats what drive us or should i say me to excell further.if you're just plain jealous of people's achievments which many parents are (especially in csc).than all i have to say is: i've worked hard to be where i am today.i'm not the best yet.but believe me when i say this.i'll be SOMEONE one day.we guys in the COE have a motto in which all of us follow.its a simple saying that goes like this: the only place where success come before work is in the dictionary.so we work hard to get to where we are today.COE has produced results where no other clubs have.its because of the simple reason that we are all hard workers who follow the coach's instruction.we don't slack during training.i can confidently say that our squad is by far the most disciplined.most professional.and most outstanding squad in the whole of singapore.i would rather train with these guys than any other squad of hundreds who do not take swimming seriously.having said this.i want to add on that i still love csc.the club which nutured me to what i am today.but i guess the policy of this thing about parents interfering with swimmers should be changed for the good of swimming.mind you some of the parents are really nice to me like aunt doreen and mark's mum.so thats all i guess about the indifference i have with certain parents.haha=)anyway.will be blogging only when i return from my holiday!feel free to add comments.cheers!   If I die tonight, I'd go with no regrets If it's in your arms I know that I was blessed And if your eyes are the last Thing that I see Then I know the beauty heaven Holds for me  But if I make it through, if I live to See the day If I'm with you, I'll know just what to say The truth be told, girl you take my Breath away Every minute, every hour, every day
