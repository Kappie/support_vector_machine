First I was deleteing spam mail from my hotmail account and my mom saw me. I guess she doesn't trust me because she flipped out sorta. Its not my fault, hotmail doesnt have a spam filter, at least I dont. *shrugs* Anyway, then my one good friend Christine and I started up a conversation. A whole bunch of stuff is getting her down and she told me she's been cutting herself since August. I can't understand.......You know, I just cant figure out why. That got me all depressed. I tried to offer her encouraging thoughts, but I dont feel like I've helped enough. Hopefully she'll feel better when she comes to PA in the summer. She loves it her, hanging out over the summer. Man, I can't even type anymore.
