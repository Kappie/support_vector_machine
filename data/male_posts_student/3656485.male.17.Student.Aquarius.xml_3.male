Some people change, some never do. Acquaintances are always worth making. Judgements can really hold you back from knowing how awesome a person can really be. And sometimes the greatest things in life are merely taken for granted.  Thoughts often flashed through my head about how in the earlier years of highschool I was the one who put myself into seclusion, not anyone else. People I may not have talked to a year ago turned out to be my best friends on the trip. Especially you Neil. Haha. I don't know what I would have done without the support of another black man like myself. This experience really has me amped to go out and meet new people this final school year. Time is starting to run out. I need to leave my mark with people.  The couple days also brought about differentfeelings concerning friendships. How am I going to deal with leaving all of my friends after high school ends? I'd like to think we could all stay in touch, but I know it just won't happen. A question came up that went like this: "When was the last time you laughed the hardest and cried the most?" After a little thought which strayed some from the original question I began to wonder if I would cry for the loss of a friend. I came to the conclusion that I would, for 1 person. I decided to bring this up in hopes of eliciting a responce from you. Would you cry for a friend? Perhaps more than one?  But enough talk of sadness, I want to end my post on a happier note. Avie makes me smile. I realized just how much I missed her over the summer. It's such a great feeling you get when reuniting with old friends. Maybe not even old friends, but ones that you love.  And there you have it ladies and gentlemen. I've just shed a tear...
