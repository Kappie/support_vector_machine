One thing always leads to another!    urlLink    The FA Cup celebrations began with some glorious weather, a fridge (and freezer) full of beer, and a fine spread put on by Miss Raynor!   urlLink    The gorgeous weather inspired a manly collaboration of DIY and cricket.   urlLink    Dave enjoyed Andy's frantic wrist action between his legs!   urlLink    Success! As fine a set of stumps as any in International Cricket!   urlLink    Like a proud dad-to-be Dave admired the finely crafted set of stumps, fashioned from Raynor's skirting board!   The initial 'stump testing' was complete. Now for some heavy duty action down at the park! We should have known it was going to end in tears!   urlLink    Armed with a kit bag full of beer (no space for the cricket stuff!) we set off for pastures green, the stumps deserved a proper cricketing baptism!   urlLink    Spotted by the locals, and fearing they may mistakenly think we were perving on their tennis playing daughters, Andy performed his  He-Man  routine.... " He has the POWER !"   urlLink    Disaster strikes! With the field set up, and everyone in position, Dan came to the crease and let rip! Perfectly poised with the bat handle in his fingers, the bat flew majestically 50feet into the sky.   The game was over .
