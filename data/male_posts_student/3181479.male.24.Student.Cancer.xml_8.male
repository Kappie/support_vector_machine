It pretty much goes without saying that the US mission to the UN is going to do just that, since it's fairly unlikely any other members of the UN Security Council would vote against any such resolution, and allowing the UNSC to pass any sort of resolution against Israel just isn't America's style.  The barrier in question is the one the International Court of Justice recently  urlLink ruled illegal , as it violates human rights.  But, apparently, as long as the only humans having their rights violated  urlLink have dark skin and wear funny pieces of cloth over their heads , that's A-OK for George W. Bush.
