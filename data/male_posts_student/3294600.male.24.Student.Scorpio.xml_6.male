About 10:45 I took a bath and fell asleep a couple times.  I had to reheat the water twice.  After being in the tub for 2 hours, I finally got out and took a nap; I woke up about 4 PM.  I got up and did more homework and waited for Dale to come home from work.  We talked for a bit and Bruce arrived not too long after.  They talked about realistate and I chatted and worked on homework.  You seeing a theme?  Sleep, homework, eat, sleep, homework, eat, sleep, repeat.  We decided to go to Tulalip Casino for their buffet and then a little gabling.  The buffet is over priced on the weekends and evenings at $16.95.  During the weekdays, it's only $9.95, almost the same thing.  Then to top it off, I wasn't even that hungry and definately did not get my money's worth.  We all signed up for VIP Player cards and received $5.00 cash to use for gambling if we chose to.  I used it and the $40 from the cash machine before we went.  In other words, this evening cost me $60.00.  *sigh*  Got home after 12:30 and now working on homework and about to go to sleep.  Tomorrow I am going north to celebrate my Mom and Uncle's Birthdays.  I'll probably stop at my other Uncle's and Grandma's tomorrow on the way home.  By the way, for Arion, who made the comment my Mom is 19 (silly boy), those were the dates of their birthday's.  Mom is actually 53, Uncle Dave is 55, and Rod is 24.  Night night.
