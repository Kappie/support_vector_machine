I am an usher at church (there are four of us), and of course the main jobs of ushers are to take up the offering and usher late people to a seat quickly as to not cause a distraction. On Easter, we have one other job, and that is to hand out chocolate easter eggs from Moore's Candy's in Hamilton, Baltimore City as an Easter present from the church. We counted a whopping 260 people at the Easter service on the 11th. The problem is that we only planned 210 easter eggs, which meant if everyone wanted one, the choir, the pastors, ushers, and 20 other people would not get any.   Now recall the story of the feeding of the 5,000. Jesus took the only food he could find, five loaves of barley and two small fish to feed 5,000 men not counting the women and the children (so it was more like 15,000 assuming everyone had a wife and one kid). His disciples fed all of those people and when they were all so full they couldn't eat any more, there were still twelve basketfuls of broken pieces left over. (For the whole story, see the middle of Luke 9.)  I felt like a disciple at that meeting on Easter last week, because in the heat of the moment, when we realized there was not going to be enough, God had a better plan. We handed them out anyway, of course. Of course it was only chocolate, and everyone had tons at home, so it didn't make much difference. Yet, somehow, there was enough to go all the way through the congregation, the choir all got one, the pastors got one, the ushers all got one, and somehow there was enough for some people, Mrs. Shelva Blight (Pastor's wife), and me to all get seconds when everyone else left.   I don't know who else agrees, and don't care, but I have to say I believe God did the "bread and fishes" miracle this Easter on the chocolate. We counted each one and there was exactly 210. There was no way it should have gone through 260. God is good!  Two cool things: 1. I am closer to my driver's license because I am getting more comfortable on the road. By May I will have my license, I promise. Then I can come and see all of you that I haven't seen in 65 years. I might stop by  urlLink Baltimore Lutheran  if I can find a car to drive down there before I get mine in June. 2. I am getting a cell phone really soon. However, I'm going to be really picky on who gets it, and to save minutes, when I am home, I'm turning it off with a message to call me at home. And really soon I'll be getting my own room phone- needed when you're 18 and in college so your parents can't spy as much.   Also, I decided because it doesn't feel right not graduating at Baltimore Lutheran, provided I pass the year (looks good so far), I still will not be participating in the ceremony. It just isn't the same. I'm not even going to my prom because it just isn't the same. I was looking forward to the prom at BLS.   Anyway, I gotta go. Enjoy this for a couple days before I blog again (maybe Wed or Thurs). Blog ya later!  In Christ, Mike >
