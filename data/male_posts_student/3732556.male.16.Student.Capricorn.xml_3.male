Coming from Kampen, Stam had an interesting start to his early years in becoming a star. Even though starting late Stam was spotted by Theo de Jong who at the time was managing FC Zwolle. Stam, spotted at his home town Kampen joined Zwolle during 1991 as so his professional career began. Leaving behind all education Stam wasn't supported much by the people at DOS Kampen. Jaap proved he could make it, he then went international playing for Holland and turned down the chance to play for Sheffield Wed.  He mentioned that he'll return to England some day and "play for a big club", this club, Manchester United. But before Man U, Cambuur Leeuwarden, first division side in north Holland offered Stam £100,000. This happened to become a bad start for Stam as he had an injury and to top it all off, the seaon's end finished off with them being relegated. 2nd season resulted in his team being 5th, much better because Stam felt better !     Jong during 95 had Stam playing for a bigger club, the fee, £400,000. This price was unusual for a lower division defender, they didn't know that Stam was a great player though, the best defender the world has ever seen. It wasn't easy as I say for Stam, he had to prove his doubters wrong. From this, Stam felt comfotable playing in the top division.  This Stam, the one and only then had an offer for £1 million for PSV Eindhoven. I didn't know what was really going on with Stam as I was very young but you could say I knew the outcome would be great !  Pre-Euro 96, Stam's debut for a national team. He faced Germany. Sounds great doesn't it, well not for Jaap, glued to a bench throughout the tournament. Poor ol Stam, only good thing was he learnt what it was like to be involved, his time would come. At least his boss at PSV Dick Advocaat taught Stam a lot "He helped me mature and turn me in to the player I am now".     PSV had won the Dutch Championship in the Dutch cup 97. This year was the best year for Stam too as Jaap was voted  "Dutch player of the year" . After his great years in Eindhoven, Stam felt he should prove himself in one of Europe's bigger leagues. "I wanted to be recognised as one of the best defenders in the world", which he still is ,"and I couldn't do that in Holland"   1998 the famous date when Jaap signed for Man U FC for £10.75million shortly before the World Cup. At this age I certainly understood what was going on and was seriously happy as Stam was coming to a club nearby and I supported. Stam helped United claim an unprecedented treble of Premiership title, FA cup and UEFA Champions League, playing in all 990 minutes of United's European campaign.     It went all down hill for me as Jaap left Man U after a good 3 years. This resulted in me becoming an even bigger Holland fan just to know that Stam would be playing for them still.     S.S. Lazio then took Stam in August 01, his early start to Italy didn't go too well, it was disrupted even and couldn't play for 4 months. I'm not saying what was wrong as I respect Jaap and I think he wouldn't want his personal life spread across the net. Now I've said this you'll want to know now, just don't !
