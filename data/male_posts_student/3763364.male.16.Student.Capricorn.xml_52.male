Is it gone? tell me what went wrong, 'Cause baby i'm not that strong,  And i'm walking wounded All alone, all alone.  Are you comfortable and numb? Did they all succumb to all those lies? Does it satisfy the greed? Is it all you need? Is it all you want? 'Cause baby i'm not that strong.  And I'm walking wounded, All alone. And baby i'm not that strong, And i'm walking wounded, All alone , all alone.  How does it feel? How does it feel?  How does it feel? How does it feel?  If your memories do stray Then they betray all that's past, And all that's been between. Is it gone? tell me what went wrong, 'Cause baby i'm not that strong.  And i'm walking wounded, All alone, And baby i'm not that strong, And i'm walking wounded All alone , alll alone,  How does it feel? How does it feel?  How does it feel? How does it feel?  How does it feel? How does it feel?  How does it feel? How does it feel, baby now?  God, I sure do loves my Tea Party.   You know what, I think I should just rot in hell for my desires as such. Waaah, waaah, I don't have a girlfriend, waah waah, I'm all alone. Who gives a shit? Lets deal with some REAL problems, not my apathetic teenage life. Worldly inhibitions be damned. Spend my life trying to help, I shall. How, is yet unknown. There are more people that need more help than I do, and help they will get. How is still unkown. Such suffering. To save the human race, we must all change. To save the human race, we must do more than send 31 cents a day to World Vision. To save the human race, we must do so much. And at the same time, I can't help but wonder if humanity is just some fell curse upon this planet.  Save or exterminate the human race, I'll put that at the top of my to-do list.  Until then, well, Matt Johnstone, as Mr. Hat would say so eloquently: "YOU GO TO HELL, YOU GO TO HELL AND YOU DIE!"  A HA HA HA.  Do you realize when all this shit began? Why, I can see quite clearly when. Quite clearly.
