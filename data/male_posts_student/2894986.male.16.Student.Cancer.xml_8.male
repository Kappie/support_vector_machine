Not nearly as much as the NCAA Tourney will give us, but a little glimpse of what we hope top see unfold over the next three weeks. My team went into the tourney with a record of 2-4. After a sluggish start, we picked up the pace and held the other team scoreless in the second quarter. We went on to win 27-14. Our next game was a nailbiter. After scoring only two points in the 3rd quarter and then getting two technicals in the 4th (not me though.) we found ourselves down 17-13. With two big baskets in the last two minutes, we took the game to OT. In OT a whopping 5 points were scored, 2 by them and by us. Our points came off of a three with eight seconds left. Our next game was downright pathetic. We just could not get a basket to fall. After scoring 2 points in the first half, we rallied to score 8 in the second. The final score was 33-10. Our final record for the season was an amazing 4-5.   Now to the NCAA Toureny. A crap shoot like usual. The SEC was especially overrated this year. UK should not have been the overall #1, Florida definently didn't deserve a 5, and Vanderbilt shouldn't be a six. And how does Alabama come out of nowhere and get an 8 seed. Though I think Louisville deserved better than a 10 seed, it is better than getting an 8/9. As for my Final Four picks, I jave OK St., UCONN, Gonzaga, and Duke. Then i have OK St. winning it all after defeating UCONN. How bout dem apples? But the Round of 32 and 16 with Pitt, Wisconsin, and OK. St. could happen many different ways. Looks like we should have quite a few really goosd matchups. Get ready for some great college baskeball and many nailbiters and upsets. Good luck with your bracket. Mine will be better than yours.  Watch the Lamb.
