We are all working hard at trying to keep the computers from falling apart and making them easier for the guys to use. A small group of people like to abuse our generousity and our skills as computer helpers and as nice people in general. It makes it hard to want to help anyone but for myself, I just need to step back and regroup.   I have homework to do. I should always put that first instead of anything extra they want me to do at work. They don't care how well I do in school anyways! I care so its me first and then they get what I give them.
