That makes 3 out of 4 family members working. And 1 freeloading cat (me!). Meow!! After thinking about the notion of getting a job, I do realise that I want to hold a job too.... I wonder if anyone would want to hire a short 16-year-old boy for a month only. Ha! Most probably not many. Meow? I think if I am applying, I am gonna go for a cashier job. Always wanted to be a cashier.    Hmm...I basically just studied a few E-Maths chapter, get tutored by the tutition teacher Maths. I also surfed the Net the whole day, then slept in the afternoon. Meow! I think I should stop blogging and go watch Charmed. House Call today! Meow!! Night blog!
