People must want to work here. It is also tough because it is hard to know who you are exaclty talking to in some situations. The lack of emotion and voice tone can also lead to many mistakes or problems. 2)	Discussion cahnged from normal talk to a kind of “can’t believe it” sort of thing. People were discussion just the facts, what had happened and were. Only the beginning of terrorist mention. Next, the rumors begin, you begin to see a lot of “ I heard” or “I bet”. This is showing the rumor factor in full gear. Also, people begin passing judgement before any real info is available. 3)	Moderated chat rooms are bieng watched over, either by a person or program. Inmediated means that anyhting goes and that there are no people or programs monitering the chat room. 4)	Emotions are a symbolic part of communication because we base what we say on the reactions we project to receive. Unfortunetely, this is no t always the case and people say things expecting one emotion and get another. 5)	Through the use of emoticons and things of that nature, computers reintroduce oral charcteristics through the things lie  happy, sad, :-O mad, etc.
