I think michael moore is a genious he came up with some of the most controversial but very very interesting topics about george bush and comparing him to the al qaeda, taliban, afghanistan, iraq, and saudi arabia.  When i finish the movie tomorrow I probably will go out and see it in theatres on the weekend because i like it sooo much.  I did not do much today i came home at 11:30am and played UO until i started reading the news around 11:30pm, and then i put farenheit on.  Well my mom still wont let me leave the house tomorrow so i am going to have to laze around for a day, but it will be worth it in the end when i finally get to goto the river and get properly drunk so i dont pass out and nearly die.  I do realize one thing, i will never drink vodka again for a month or so lol, because i took a sip yesterday and almost vomited thats how bad the memories that come back are.  Well i am going to get a deed for my blacksmith in UO right now before i goto bed, talk to you later  Chris  going to bed
