Oh, well..there was something I got yesterday...looking through the shops I got myself a candleholder for those little tealight candles...found a really nice gothic dragon one, the dragon is curled up around the place where the candle goes, and when its in the dark and burning it looks brilliant. Looks like I may go into the shop again, there are some nice swords, bat-leths, knives, dragons and all sorts in there...  I have Quake working, played it, located the difficulty setting that is "so bad it is hidden" and playing it....I had almost forgotten the way Quake makes you jump when one second you're on full health and armour, next you die having been torn to shreds by some creature with claws for arms...great game...just got to get the GLquake working so I can use the videocards 3D acceleration in quake.  Also have Outlaws working, I love the Outlaws game!  College is going okay as well...steam distillation went well, and while that was going I was able to do a few titrations at the same time.  One last thing, I have got Carnivores at last!! Finally I can go for prehistoric hunting! So far I got a few allosaurs in my trophy room, best shot so far was at 38 metres with the crossbow!  Anyway, thats all for now...Happy Hunting.
