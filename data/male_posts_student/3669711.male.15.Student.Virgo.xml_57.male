What i'm doing is helping with the games at my church's VBS (Vacation Bible School), and getting paid 25 dollars a day.   So, i work in the morning, then i come home and fool around for the rest of the day.  Pretty cool stuff if i must say so myself.  I don't know what i'm going to do with the money yet, but i think its' going to be donated to my anime con "fund".  Lol.   Lates
