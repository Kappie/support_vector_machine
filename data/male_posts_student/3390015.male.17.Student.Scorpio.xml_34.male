And now, without futher adieu, I give you:  The Adidas a3 Ultraride!      These have been my previous kicks, and I can't even think of throwing them away, they've been so good to me, the best shoes I've ever had, and they were designed specifically for Kevin Garnett! Sort of space agey - and they're the most comfortable shoes ever made!
