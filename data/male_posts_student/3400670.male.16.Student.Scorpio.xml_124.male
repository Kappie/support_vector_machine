Also 6th period may be in for a treat...my sister (THE LEGEND) is coming into town probably around 6th period.  Who is a very competitive player?  The Clark girls will DOMINATE!  (Trash talking on the Blog...a first for me.)  Miss Hillary thank you for the kind words and it has been a tough year and I don't think I was at my best but hopefully we all learned something.  And I have to say you are definately one of the most talented and diligent classes I have ever had. So make sure you enjoy each other.  You are lucky to have a group of students who enjoy learning and thinking.  I expect great things from you in your Senior year and would love for you all to keep in touch!      Thomas I hope you are having a good time in Portland.  Make sure you get all the assignments that are due tomorrow.  (AP HUMOR)  See you tomorrow...let's have a great finish...(My internship is all over but the shouting...)  Bring on the farewell tour.  CLARK
