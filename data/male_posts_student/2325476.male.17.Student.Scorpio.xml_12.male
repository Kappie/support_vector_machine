Well I never ever delete anyone off my buddy list (well, one person). So I'm just randomly checking people's profiles and the like, and i come across C's. Well her away message says she's sick, and that her parents went out to dinner and left her no food or money. I leave her a message, semi-serious, semi-joking, telling her that if she's hungry, I'd bring her something to eat. Wouldn't ya fucking know it, she didn't have me on her buddy list or have any idea who i was. So i'm there trying to explain that she gave me her SN a whle back, and i just dont delete anyone, and whatever. Now the internet doesn't allow for me to make inferences from body language, tone of voice, eye contact, etc., but i think it's pretty safe to say she kinda felt like i was stalking her. And thats all i fuckin need, another girl thinking i'm stalking her!  *sigh* :(
