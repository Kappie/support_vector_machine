Another failed attempt at going bowling because the bowling alley closes at 10:00 on Sunday night. Another bad day for my car: it sounds like the muffler is going to fall off at any time now, and the exhaust fumes seem to be leaking into the car because it STINKS. I'm taking it to the mechanic this week to end this bullshit. The grand total is going to be at least $1,000......FUCKSHITBITCHCUNTCOCKSUCKERMOTHERFUCKER!!!!!!!!!! Whew.  I got a huge headache from driving around tonight. I don't know if it was the loud roaring sound that was giving me the headache, or if it was the carbon monoxide from my broken exhaust system/leaking fuel tank. Whatever it was, it was getting me worried so I had to drop everyone off pretty early. Sorry guys!!!  I'm sick of the BULLSHIT EXCUSES people make when they want to get out of doing something. I may be a big doofus, but I ain't stupid.. It really makes me question who my friends really are. :(  Finally got my Fall semester grades from UAlbany. Four A's and one C+. Two words: FUCK PHYSICS!  Couldn't sleep last night. Way too many crazy thoughts going through my head:  *If you travel into space at the speed of light for 10 years, and then return to Earth at the speed of light for another 10 years, you will be 20 years older, but the Earth will be 460 years older. This is actually true; we calculated it in Physics lecture using relativity formulas. Too bad it's not humanly possible to do this. *In Alaska, there are 24 hours of darkness on the first day of winter and 24 hours of daylight on the first day of summer. I remember watching the Alaska episode of Insomniac w/ Dave Attell. They were drinking outside at midnight and it was sunny. That's gotta be an experience.  Haha, I feel better already. That's what's so great about this blog, it's a nice place to vent your feelings and get the troubles off your mind instead of drinking them away or smoking yourself so stupid that you don't even know what the word "problem" means. :)  -BIGsmut.
