Benedict, charged with walking upon or along the railroad tracks of the New York Central.  The unusual feature of the affair developed in the fact that Judge Benedict conducted court on this occasion in the open.  The thirty-five "hos," as they are known about town, all pleaded guilty to the charge, but were dismissed on the condition that they leave town immediately.  Thus was hastened the departure of these knights of the macadem whose annual inux into Brockport is occasioned by the hope that they may obtain employment at the canning factory during the fall rush.
