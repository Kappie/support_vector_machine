Camp camps camps. One camp we woke up at 1.00 a.m. and did solo night. After that, we had to do 1500 push-ups. The other camp, we were sleeping on the ground which was covered with rocks and stones. Sandflies and mosquitoes constantly harassed us. When we were sleeping, that irritating sound of mosquitoes is unbearable. I'm glad that all camps are over. Starting a new blog. Will see it soon.
