In the film, some chick (Drew Barrymore) meets some playboy (Adam Sandler...talk about some poor typecasting). Badaboom, badabing,They fall in love.  Thing is this chick has a disorder where she has no short term memory (aka, she can't remember the day before, therefore everyday forgetting Sandler). Cue Hilarity. Sandler then uses his shy wit that we all so fucking love to figure out whats going on. He finds that the people in the chick's (damnit, I'm just gonna call her A and Sandler shall be B) life have been lying to her and making her think that everyday is the day after the day she had her accident. Uh huh, that' exactly what I said. Anyways, the people work so hard at making A (remember the variable she was given?) think that it's the day after the accident that the viewer will curl their lip in disgust and feel as if they had just received a donkey punch in the kidneys. I mean come on, is this how low Hollywood has sunk to? They figure if they throw enough random shit at the viewer, maybe they won't realize that at this point the writers have run shit out of ideas. I'd give the movie a....2 out of 5 because they might as well have given me a swift kick to the testes, stolen $5 from my wallet, and sent me on my way.
