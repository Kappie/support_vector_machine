For those who do not know it is Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. This game is the best Star Wars game I have ever played.  There are amazing aspects to this game that i have always wanted in a Star Wars game.  You start out as  some guard on a ship that is being attacked.  You later fall to this planet and begin to find a jedi named Bastilla.  So while you are on the planet u can talk to people and either be rude or be polite. Doing wut is wrong will give u darkside points and doing wut is right will give u light side points.  Obviously i have chosen to go to the darkside. The only problem with that is your characters face gest all messed up oh well anything for the side of evil.  I advise this game to all  Star Wars fans and rpg fans alike this is a great game.  lates,  Smog
