I really don't have much left in that class because yestarday I drove on the Interstate and took the Indiana Driver Manual test (it was so stupid because after you finished the test, the teacher gave us 5 minutes to look through the manual to correct a few of the wrong answers - and then I had the second highest score in the class, a 62/66. it's a pretty stupid class.) I have two more drive times (downtown and parking stuff) and four more class sessions (one on Monday cause of no class on the 5th) of videos and worksheets. OK, a bike ride for those going on the trip has been set for tomorrow (Thursday) at 2:00 at the church. We will plan to ride down to CG and the Whittens, etc. Last thing, does anyone watch/listen to the music that I link for songs of the day?  "Cleveland rocks!" - John Kerry on a clip from David Letterman's "John Kerry - LIE"   urlLink Vindicated - Dashboard Confessional  (Spiderman 2 theme - like Hero from Spiderman)  "Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring forth." Proverbs 27:1
