Its a good job that I have started writing now as it takes ages to write a few paragraphs.  The scientific style sucks for writing.  Having been reading lots of theses recently I don't think that it helps to convey information better.  And it makes it harder to write.  However, I am not doing to badly.  Have made a start on the Introduction and a results chapter.  Finding all the gels and sequence alignments I should have done earlier and have to do now.  Ooops.  But have had to stop.  Been writing all day and my brain is starting to melt......
