That, is what you call a horribly horrid performance!  And I tell you, their downfall was using the most amateur instrument of modern day poetry, rhyme! Lousy, lousy, lousy, and they all thought it was marvellous... It is such a straightforward recitation of our thoughts that even my mom conceded it was bloody boring. Why, why, why? Why didn't they just accept that laughter is always the best way to get through. Why did they not accept my script? Because they wanted it serious.   I tell you that if you're being judged by a panel that supposed to be open to all forms of presentation, that thing would have been so fine, but hello, in front of a larger audience, the one sure thing that will win all of them is their participation. What can induce them to participate? Clapping! What can make them clap? LAUGHTER! Next time something like this happens... Fuck it off, cause they're not going to listen to the truth anyway. This team is so fucked up. Make Michael god then...
