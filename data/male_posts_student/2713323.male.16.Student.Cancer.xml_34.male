Neeways went to kels house yesterday and joined ryan, geng and eden...played like crazy and went to mac to eat...geng's dad called me saying that why didnt he pick up the phone..he called 6 times..i said i didnt know so i asked geng to call him...den he called, and had a quarrel with his dad...den his dad got pissed and asked him not to come home...i called his dad hoping to solve things out and the father shouted at me. I was like...the hell? He said that i influenced him to go out and everything...i feel damn angry...i didnt even call him to go out...he was the one who called kelvin and asked him whether he could go over to his place. Then he told his father that he was at my house...hes using me like a shield...and i get blamed. This is not the first time...his dad called the other time and geng wasnt at my house...i was like, doing my homework around 10.30 on a sunday night and his dad said i was sort of lying cos he didnt believe that geng wasnt at my house. His mum oso, when i watching a movie, she called me like 17 times and heard my voicemail over and over again and she said i didnt want to pick up the phone and i was playing around with her...she scolded me and asked me to let geng go home. He said he could watch the movie and come home late...i took his word for it. I didnt even force him or anything, hell, i didnt even ask him to watch the movie with me. ++ his mum oso said that i was a bad influence and an ah beng b'cos she saw me with a guy with DYED HAIR (sisters ex-bf). She thinks that as long as u dye ur hair ur ah beng. Really damn angry sia...doh! Nvm dun talk about this...hey2...i miss you hui! hope ur doing better den me over there...kk ciaooo O_o
