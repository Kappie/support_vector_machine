I remember when I first met you and I was all like… wow… there’s something special about this girl. I was right. Somehow our lives had intersected many times despite us not meeting until we were far away from our everyday lives. I know sometimes I can cross the line in joking around, but you are like almost a sister to me. You are also one of the few friends who is willing to not sugarcoat advice and tell me things I don’t want to hear.  2. This applies to 2 friends actually… You’re a friend I’ve known for most of my life. It’s amazing how long our friendship has gone on despite being away for school. You guys are my most trusted friends.  3. I’ve known you forever. We’ve been a tag team for most of our lives. If anything I do feel a regret that we don’t get to hang out like we used to (or cause the trouble that we used to). I've always been amazed at your talent and potential for great things. I just hope your dreams get realized.  4. In regards to you, I will always wonder if things would have been different if I didn’t go to school in NY. However, it was me being away and boredom in a new place that made me get back in touch in you. Getting in touch with you was totally worth it, and I know how I see the world would be different right now if we hadn’t gotten back in touch.  5. I’ve known you for a few years now and despite the distance that has always separated us, you have always been someone I feel I can trust and talk to. You’re definitely one of my closest friends, despite us never having hung out, toasted our drinks, and partied all night long.  6. I’ve known you for half my life, and if anything I’m sorry for how much we heckle you sometimes. It’s been ages since we last hung out or even chatted online. We should make up for lost time.  7. I don’t know what it was about you that instantly drew me to you and perhaps stills draws me in more than I should let it. Maybe it’s the fact that you are one the few people I feel like I can be completely myself around. I just feel comfortable when I’m around you. I look forward to the future.  8. You’re a friend who has never ceased to amaze me with your intellect, class, and niceness. If I had to say that anyone is perfect and good, it’d be you.   9. This applies to 2 people. You are a really good person, but I don’t know why you annoy me. Is it the questions you ask or your opinions? I feel guilty every time I get annoyed at something you do or say.   10. I haven’t known you very long (not quite a year), but you are an extremely intelligent young lady who has rare good taste in music. We’re just getting to know one another, and I look forward to knowing more.  11. I’ve known you for a few years now, and we don’t really hang out much. However, you’re almost like a little sister to me. When you email me and tell me about the stuff, I can’t help but be proud.  12. I’ve known you all my life, and I know I haven’t been the best person to you. For that I’m sorry. I can only hope that we can finally enjoy a beer together.  Ok that's it for now...
