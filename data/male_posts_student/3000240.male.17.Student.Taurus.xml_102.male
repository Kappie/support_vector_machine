Anyway, It's Friday night and I have absolutely nothing planned except writing offensive comments in an e-forum and maybe contributing to one if I feel especially productive. Gives me a good chance to get a bath and get the driver on my ignamous parasite of a home PC sorted. Well not  me  technically but John from work. However I figure that the ÃÂ£10 payment should buy the claiming rights to that one and make me look and feel just grand.  College feels particularly strange at the moment - especially now I'm a 6.2 whereas last week I was just a mere tiny 6.1 midget. The place too seems petite in comparison, and I guess that could be to do with the fact that, half the people aren't here; possibly because they've realised they're too blond et al for college, or, in my opinion, they have been abducted or eaten by some mass government conspiracy. Well this is how much time I have on my hands these days that I actually formulate these premises/ denoumons .  Thankfully England, or Rooney beat Switzerland last night and so we're still in the competition thus far. Next up if the green room with Ian on Monday for the Croatia game (wherever the "green room" is I have no Idea, It's Ian's fault like most things in life). I guess we'll win narrowly and France will beat the Switz by even less and be given far more credit than us for there "champion spirit". Wasn't the world cup 2 years ago, and the limited victories over minnow nations in the Euro qualifiers enough indication, that this team, despite its great individual talent, has:  1. Got and over-rated manager, who will do worse than Pleat did at Spurs next season. 2. Become two years past its sell-by date?  Oh well, what do I know, I'm only 17 and small and my opinions are worthless compared to people who are so unbelievably over-paid to play, manage, and analyze this game. I guess so. Has anyone noticed however, how absolutely vile the ITV football commentators were last night, messers Tlysdley and Robson? One, Robson (as my Dad would say) is the most boring man on Earth at the best of times when in the 50's; and Tylsdley . . . *huffs and scowls vigorously* Tylsdley just one doesn't shut up, and his over-emphasised cliche's and the mention of Manchester United on over 25 occasions in every match (including the Botswana v Zimbabwe womens friendly reserve match more recently) is just placing in some mental trauma for the 120 minutes I am forced to sit through his "commentary".  Anyway, enough of my ranting, I can see (yes through my wonderful internet remote viewing) that you are asleep by now, so I hope you, all have a funky weekend, and I most certainly will on Saturday with Jo Jo hehe. Ciao mon ami. xBuBzx
