Too bad my signature looks like total crap though, and I look like...not me..or something.  But whatever.  I finally freakin got it!  Holy crap!  I've never been so excited over a stupid piece of plastic in my entire life!  Anyways tomarrow is no fun and games day.  I get locked up in a room for 4-5 hours and am forced to do tests until I die of bordem.  See-Exit Exams.  Even though I'm in 11th grade, they still want me to take them I guess.  But I dont' want to.  Ever.  As a matter of fact, I ditched last year in my Sophmore year so I wouldn't have to take them!  But oh well...tomorrow will suck, and then Wed will too, because I get to do it all over again.  Though I do get to buy my Solace ticket...I think.  But whatever.  If I don't do it on Wed, then I'll probably go on Thursday.  It'll give me an excuse to walk down to McDonald's and play their DDR Extreme machine.  (WHY DID THEY LOCK THE SONGS!?  DIE!)  And maybe I'll play the 3rd Mix machines down at the Boardwalk...and ride Supreme Scream...yah.  Okay...well now that I've told you all about my secret plans...I'll have to go make new ones...with my new ID card....(heh heh heh....)  That and I'm hungry so...bye.
