From what started as an unreal, exciting and strange experience has turned into a fun and likable new surrounding.  I can't wait to get back here, and I haven't even left yet lol.  It will be surreal going back to England hearing Brittish accents instead of the American ones.  I can imagine messing a few thigs up like saying chips instead of crisps, I have got used to chips now and it will probably take a while to shake that off lol!  That and soda also... o.O  I'm scared of the jet lag which is ahead of us.  I don't like things messing with my head, it makes me feel sick :(  Speaking of which, I better get off to bed before I go too late.. again!  I'm going to take a mini-journal on the plane again, plus the great views from the plane windows If I can.
