I dare you to talk to at least three people on any one of these services and have all of them use proper English. It's just not possible. Now some of you may be saying "wut r u talking abt? lol" or "u'r crazy!!1". If that's the case, then please jump off a cliff into a vat of acid that has spikes on the bottom which are on fire and also possibly sharp. When people first start using the internet, they should undergo weekly sessions with a doctor to ensure they don't start using abbreviations every second word. Some people say it's to save time, but how much time can be saved from cutting out one or two letters and replacing them with a NUMBER or something even further away from the original keys? Good thing you're saving time while I have to bust out my handy-dandy "Idiot Redneck to English" translator everytime your MSN window flashes. Idiots.  When asked about his victory, the internet was quoted as saying "fuk u, fgt".
