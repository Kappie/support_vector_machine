Actually you probably would, but I don't feel like telling you all of it.   Last night we watched  The Pajama Game .  Ugh... I'm not sure I even  want  to try out now.  And, just like in  Oklahoma! , the two best songs were left out of the movie, while plenty of awful and/or pointless ones were left in.  Why can't our school do a good musical for once? It doesn't feel like Christmas eve, namely because I've been to busy with totally non-Christmas-related things to be anticipating it all that much.  I haven't finished you guys's Christmas presents yet, either, so don't expect to get them any time near Christmas.  Sorry. In other news,  Return of The King  ruled!  Can't wait for the four and a half hour extended edition.  Or five.  I hope it's five. In other, other news, Charles Dickens'  A Christmas Carol  rules!  Like a bad lobster!  Well, rotate my vertices and call me a trapezoid!
