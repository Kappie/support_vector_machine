I became the Drum Major in sec3 and he remained at his post as the Librarian. He had this problem of latecoming...and he was in my EXCO. So it is normal to give him a bit more chances, but yet. Every single time I give him a chance, he just turns up late again the next time. Everytime he does that, I feel pissed off and really disappointed. It's been a yr and now, I'm feeling really ashamed that he's even in the EXCO. As in, he's not setting a gd example for juniors, and who cares what he can do for the library department when he doesn't have basic things like self-discipline. But on the other hand, after some thought over the entire issue, I realised it was about him, but it was my fault. After a whole year of being his Drum Major, and three yrs as his friend, I've failed him completely. And I was trying to tell him that just now. But I can't believe the response I got. He's always late cause he had some reason he wouldn't want to tell anyone about?! Yes, and as far as I'm concerned. The way he put it is like it's my freaking fault to even bother helping him, and the fact that I feel upset is because it's just the way I feel and it's like there's nothing to do with him just made me explode. I'm not angry at him. I'm just so freaking sad and fed up that he can't see how much I'm doing all these because I want to help him as a friend. Since that's the way it's going to be, then just forget it. Forget it all.
