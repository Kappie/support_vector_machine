So its a different thing, don't expect some IRC convo copy and pasted here which actually spends 2 hrs talking about cybersex, which imo think its a total waste of time, and I think its for lamers who haven't experience what is sex in the context of true love. In fact, I haven't and also most people involved in cybersex are innocent puberscent teenagers, which I happen not to fit into the category.  Anyway, before I get more and more into cybersex let's explore sex in the most most "purest" form, and by purest I mean wear your fig leaf garment and stuff. What is sex about really? I don't know, no no seriously I don't. Why? Because I have not had sex yet, DUH! But its amazing as to how many opposite ends of the spectrum can sex be approached, from the cistern monk style of not talking about it at all, to the typical teenage pre-occupation with it, and i mean pre-occupation, perpetually.  Yea, and don't think that girls are the shy gender, before I launch into a sociological discussion on gender, which *gasp* I haven't, after all gender was the issue which tickled my critical thinking skills. Yah yah, I know a bulk of my readers are all teenagers like YOU, so you're those kind who'll most probably be those who "get to the point" and hate small talk like this. Well, after all this is foreplay, and yea I'll launch into a discussion.........  Now, yea ok let's start, I won't go into the very technical details and this post would not be something too esoteric about sex, because of course, where do you guys know about sex? Porn? I mean geessh, that is the worst place to learn about sex. If you seriously want to learn about sex, as in LEARN not to get stimulated. Read books about sex, so kids.....yes, today we shall learn about sex, and yah ok, first take out tissue paper wipe the saliva dripping from your mouth cos' we're not watching porn. And no, we're not getting into 101 various positions from the kamasutra to *insert signature move of porn star here*. We'e reading.....*insert name of a sexologist who happened to be a smiling and kinda fat middle aged guy*'s book.  Sex is serious business dude, its the single factory which drives the manufature of you and me, and of course porn. But what really is sex? Sex comes in many different forms, SM, oral, to name a few. But sex is after all, about intercourse. And what really is intercourse? In english, intercourse is communication, and lemme say this whoever came up with the word intercourse for sex, is indeed a genius and he has a very very lucky partner/s. So yes, kids, sex is.......say together with me......communication.  Ok, sex is more than carnal pleasure, the penetration, the fluids, and all those physical processes, yea which I think after so long watching porn, you should be more than familiar than that. But there's one thing you can't know just by watching those cheap plastic american flicks, it is the psycological aspects of sex, the joining of one heart one soul and of course 2 extremely sensitive parts of the body. What is sex, and most importantly, what is good sex? Good sex is communication.  It is sensing the nuances of each other. How is your partner feeling? It is pleasing each other, and is about selfless giving. In fact I see that sex should be celebrated and lauded as one of the most profound mediums of communication which God has given us, to be shared by someone who we spend the rest of our lives with. In fact I think that this way which God has created us to reach puberty at early teenage years, should be the time when we discover about sex, after all biology points to that.  It is society which dumbs us down with MTV, Mcdonalds and not forgetting porn. This makes us unable to handle the deep implications involved in sex. It is said that Singaporeans are one of the worst in bed, why? No, not because there's no porn in SG, but rather I believe the lack of exposure to what REALLY is sex, and HOW to have sex, sex really takes a minute to learn and a lifetime to master (reversi? lol). Good sex, is like what I stated above, communication. I believe that we should all adopt a mature approach to sex.  And come on, let's talk about sex, in a mature fashion of course talk about it with your friends, your parents, in your church, talk about sex. Know more about it, and trust me, the more you know about it, the less "curious" you'll be, and porn would not be some place you get information about sex. Before having sex, hold conversations with your partner, don't be afraid to try SM, or any other more far-out practices if necessary as long as both parties are satisfied (not my kinda thing though), but don't forget the true meaning of sex, which is not carnal pleasure but communication. Don't just lapse into sleep after sex, linger in each other's presence, talk, communicate......  Anyway.....I'm done....now, didn't that felt good?
