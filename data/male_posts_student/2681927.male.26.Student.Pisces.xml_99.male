Well, the information have now reached  urlLink The Westboro Baptist Church  in Topeka, KS, and they will  urlLink protest  against this.   "God is not mocked!" God Hates Fags!  Fag-Enablers!  Ergo , God hates Sweden with an irreversible hatred for same-sex marriage and for criminalizing Gospel preaching!   And who's to blame for this? Apparently, our king, Carl XVI Gustaf.   Whatever of past glory Sweden could heretofore have boasted, Sweden is now and forever shall be famous for only one thing, to wit: Sweden is where the machinery of the King Karl[sic] XVI Gustaf's criminal law was cranked up and jailed a humble Gospel preacher - Pastor Ake Green - for declaring truth about faggot maggots.   That the Swedish king has no power what so ever, he's certainly not the one who decide the law in Sweden, seems to have escaped WBC. But I liked the "faggot maggots" part, very poetic.  And to finish it off:   America´s only hope is to immediately break off all diplomatic relations with Sweden, stop all flights to and from Stockholm, criminalize all trade with Sweden, freeze all Swedish bank accounts in America and use the money to support those prosecuted under the Swedish faggot law, boycott and embargo all things Swedish.   Okay, as long as you don't over-react.  (Thanks to  urlLink Gudmundson  for the pointer)
