Imagine yourself young, running around in the open country, darting in and out from behind tree trunks and turning over rocks to discover alien planets. That shit was great. So let me buy you your next bottle, and we will toast to our childhood! I went to the library today to trade a few books that needed to be turned in for some fresh ones that I will read soon. I found some great ones; eight of John Muir's books in one 'volume,' an ecology book, and a biography on John Muir. I'll be stoked if I finish up a few of those books in that volume. I've already started in on "The story of my boyhood and youth" and it is stirring up a lot of good memories of when I was a boy - always outside poking at the world around me.  After the Library, I worked at the book store from 12-8:30. I had a lady bring me a House Finch that had fallen from the nest. I kept him warm and after I left work and went searching for the nest, I couldn't reach it so I placed him directly under it and hoped for the best. I would have to put him down if I took him to the center; maybe his chances are better close to his parents. He is fledging anyways so he might already start eating on his own and flying even sooner.  I also met a former professor of Sonoma State University, he was very encouraging as far as telling me that my goal was obtainable and he wished me luck. He seemed like a very interesting man, obviously paralyzed from the waist down but able to walk with crutches. Determination is an impressive quality for anyone. He taught ethics and sociology, mostly for people going towards masters in social work/public service.   current mood:  good current music: Murder City Devils - Press Gang
