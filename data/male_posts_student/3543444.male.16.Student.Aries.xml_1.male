We looked at an electric eel, red snapper, nurse shark, and had a chance to touch a stingray! After we completed the tour, we hopped on a train and did some more research on shark. We went inside a tunnel thatcontained 7 tons of water held up only by 5 inches of thick glass! We seen several different types of sharks. I  learned about so many fish and what may happen if you weren't careful with certain fish. When we went there, we weren't able to ride anything, I would like it if we could have did something to enjoy. Maybe they can go to a kind of zoo where they can feed the animals. They can see how they are bred and mantained.
