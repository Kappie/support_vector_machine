It was fun getting up at 4:30 in the morning, driving out to a cemetery at 5:30, waiting for flags to be placed at veterans' graves to show up for two hours, and then going home when they never did.  Then, of course, thirty minutes later I had to go back up to the cemetery for the actual ceremony where we placed the suddenly-present flags by a select group of graves.  Good times.  Actually, our Company First Sergeant, who's the senior Young Marine in our unit, is about to wrap up her tenure in the Young Marines.  She ships off to Big Marines in August, so that's kind of sad.  We've been partners for the last four years or so.  It's been real.  I can't wait to go out to California.  I'm supposed to call USC tomorrow--actually, I WAS supposed to call them today--about when their "Meet USC" summer program is, and I'll be sure to do it tomorrow.  I've got to get out of Waco for a little while because it just seems to suck all the life out of me (especially when school's out).  Going out to LA will be a pleasant change from the monotony of the past year.  On a happier note, I found out that I could very well have an incredible internship next year in the MISD public relations department.  According to Mrs. B (newspaper adviser), the lady who is head of the department asked if I would be willing to intern her (i.e. write press releases, cover events, etc.) next year.  I'm still trying to work out my schedule for next year, but I would love to have the opportunity to do that.  That, added on with a possible PR internship at the Dr. Pepper Museum this summer, could put me well on my way to a career in PR.  Yeah, I'm stoked.  You know it.  GOAL UPDATE!  GOAL UPDATE!  I'm writing a song that basically has to be completed by Sunday morning for my mother's birthday since I'll be at LIFE on the Big Day (yeah, it's sad.  I know.).  It's a lot harder than I thought it would be.  Last year's just seemed to come out of my fingertips, but this year's is a bit more challening.  Ah, well.  Nothing like a good ol' musical challenge to get the blood a-flowing!  I've also started my first short story in French.  It's actually a lot of fun: it expands my vocabulary while providing practical application for the grammatical aspects of the language that I have learned.  I call it  Les superbes aventures de Jules , which translates to "Jules's Magnificent Adventures."  Yeah, it's pretty straightforward, but hey, I can't start out writing like Voltaire, now can I?  Hehe, if only I could.  Tomorrow it's off to Chili's for a hopeful job interview as well as calling the lady from the MISD PR department.  Mmm, I like the taste of summer.
