I noticed the other people sitting in court (not the lawyers up at the front who were doing actual talking) were doing crossword puzzles, playing games on their Blackberries (or just e-mailing A LOT), doodling, nodding off, and, in one case, reading what looked like the National Enquirer.  That seemed particularly bad.  Even marginally worse than one of the lawyer who was doing a crossword... FROM A BOOK OF TV GUIDE CROSSWORDS.  This is (presumably) a woman with a law degree.  Surely she could challenge herself with something more rigorous than a crossword from TV Guide.  1-Across:  The _________ Boat 2-Across:  The _________ Wheel 3-Across:  Actor Hanks  Ooh, gotcha there I bet.  The answer to 3-Across is Colin, not Tom.  So I was in court from 10AM-6PM or so.  We were given an hour lunch break.  I went to the nearby Amish Market, which was definitely not run by the Amish, because it had lights and refrigeration.  And sushi.  And empanadas.  And all sorts of things I bet the Amish don't use/eat/have/believe in.  It was cheating.  I don't understand it at all.  On the way back to the office on the subway I ran into someone I know.  That's been happening a lot this summer.  I must know a lot of people, or just be really lucky that way lately.  Tonight our firm social activity was a big reception at a public interest organization with a bunch of people from lots of other firms.  I feel okay saying this, because so many firms were there that I'm not actually revealing anything.  The organization deals with battered women.  The reception featured a performance by a rap group.  This makes sense, right?  Because rap songs never have any negative implications about women.  There was a "Chinese Auction" at the event.  A "Chinese Auction," to my surprise, does not involve Chinese babies being sold to the highest bidder.  Apparently it's like a silent auction, only with an ethnically insensitive name.  Different from a Jewish auction, where the lowest bidder wins.  I have an idea for a new consumer product to capitalize on the Atkins craze.  Low-carb shampoo.  Because shampoos are always advertising that they've got oatmeal, or fruit extracts, or rye bread in them.  All carbs.  I want a low-carb shampoo.  For a low-carb diet.  For a low-carb me.  :)
