We played around the world because we have a test tomorrow. Then I went to cooking with Trent. We got to pick our kitchens for our lab tomorrow. We are making some kind of cookie. I picked Trent, Shana, Julie, and I for a kitchen. I'm so excited for cooking tomorrow. In math we talked about triangles and the kites we are making next week and in health we watched some videos about safe sex. At lunch I had some people sign my yearbook. During chorus we practiced for our concert. In gym we played softball.. it was quite boring considering I really suck at it. Seventh hour in Mr. Flanagan's class we read some stuff aloud and at the end of the hour I had him sign my yearbook. He wrote, "Despite your reluctions to believe itm you have a lot ofpotential as a writer. Keep working at it. - Mr Flangan" I was like.. WOAH BIG WORDS! I wonder if English teachers always talk that way or if they just do it at school. Mrs. Brunner also signed my yearbook eighth hour. She wrote, "I have had a great time with you this year. You are very funny. Enjoy high school. - Mrs. Brunner" Are they just writing that because they want to be nice or do they really feel that way? I'm so confused. Even Mr. F said something nice about me and we got in a huge fight. Unbelievable. Really it is. After school Trent, Katie, and I worked at the fifth and sixth grade track meet. Trent and I got to time along with Matt Priebe and some other older people. After the meet was over I ran a lap. Well more like 3/4 of a lap but it's about the same thing. When I came home I ate dinner and worked on a bit of my homework. Then my dad came home and Champ came with him so I played with him for a bit. When my dad was done eating he gave me a mo-ped ride. We rode to Farm and Fleet to get some car wash and stuff. He got me a GIANT Hersheys bar. I only ate four squares of it. Then I came home and played on the comp, did more homework, and watched T.V.   AS OF RIGHT NOW: Ryan just asked Kirsten out and I believe she is going to say yes.  I don't know if Trent still likes me or not. But I know for a fact that I still like him. I just want him to ask me.
