Had anxiety attack in the Michigan portion on the way home with nothing but semi's jackknifed in ditches and cars in the nearby forests.  I guess now I kinda have trouble driving in the winter.  PTSD?  I dunno.  So Tae Kwon Do was fun last night.  Lark was back, so that was cool.  I guess she caught viral pneumonia while on the table and was really jacked up for the week.  But she is better now, so thats good.  Tiff's sciatic is messed up and she it putting herself out for 6 weeks... sucks, but you gotta do what you gotta do.  Todd is still nuts.  Saw him banging his head against the wall.  Jack was there, just a normal 17 year old.  Good kid, a bit annoying though.  Complains more than I do.  And as for me, my back is kinda messed up.  I dunno if I have a bruised kidney or what.  Left side, lower, outter is swollen according to Sam and it hurts with pressure and movement.  Couldnt tell ya whats wrong.  Oh well.  Yeah.  John had another good talk last night.  Was doing his usual philosophy that nature is cause and effect and there is no happy or sad.  Dont be stuck on the emotional rollercoaster because good things happen and bad things happen, and we just have to be content with the moment.  He also went into how we should stay in the present moment, and move our lives towards the future we want, but to not plan for that future because you cant really control what is going to happen down the road.  Only the causes and effects of what you do in the present matter.  You had to be there to get the full effect of it.  Anyways, I have to go watch the little one, as usual...
