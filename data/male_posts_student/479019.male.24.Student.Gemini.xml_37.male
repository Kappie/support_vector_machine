Yes more mp3s for me. I'm a total concert and mp3 addict right now. But it's culture, man! Historians will be looking back on what I'm doing now in 50 years and be research this! Or perhaps me!  Speaking of history... I got some more research done today. I managed to get stuff on  Blockade  from  Variety  and  The Daily Worker , as well as get the stuff from the  Motion Picture Review Digest  printed. After that I actually went to the gym to work out... I gotta get myself in good physical shape for Warped Tour!  Playing right now is some nice accoustic stuff such as an accoustic version of  Offspring 's "Defy You," Jimmy Eat World's "The Middle,"  Bad Religion 's "Do What You Want," and Green Day's "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)."  ****
