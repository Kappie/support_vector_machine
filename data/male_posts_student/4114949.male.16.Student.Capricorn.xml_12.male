It hit me really hard though, because my gran and grandad were both really affected by it. They seemed to have aged by 10 years in just the last 2. The service was really sad, but afterwards we all went to a pub and it was quite fun. I got served my first ever pint, which I'm pretty chuffed about. :p  I got home at about 2pm, and I went on the computer. I had a convo with my best friend Gemma. I've been in love (well, I don't know if it's love, but it seems like it) with her for over a year now, and it's frustrating the hell out of me.  She's going on holiday for a week, she's going early tomorrow morning, and I already miss her like crazy :( This really sucks, I just wish I could talk with her :(  Jack...
