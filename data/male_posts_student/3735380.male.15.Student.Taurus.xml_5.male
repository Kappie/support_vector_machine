First of all, my manager told me to remember to put the fries on the fry-rack from left to right, so that the runners for the drivethrough would pick them up left to right.  Simple? Not really. I had to mentally calculate every the rate of consumption of fries, and put a fry in the tub to cook if they were getting low. And who says working at McDonald's isn't mentally exhausting?  Finally, for the last 30 minutes I had to work at the first window. Collect change. That's all there is to it. A horribly simple job they call "the hole"; literally a hole in the wall.  Finally the day was over, and I was off 30 minutes early. That's 2 hours and 30 minutes of work. On the dot. I collected my meal and left with my paycheck.  I waited in the car to open it. I thought for a minute that I didn't have enough hours.  I opened the check. Sixty-four dollars? Usually I make about 75 a week. This is 10 dollars below. Well, I guess it's not that bad. More than I ever got for a birthday. And I get paid every two weeks, so that's pretty good too.  Okay, not so bad for a paycheck.
