No one but me will and can make the judgment of who I am and what I want to look like from the outside and inside. No, I am not talking about pot. Cigarettes. Should I do it? What will happen if I do OR don't. Right now I say no but my whacked up head is un decided. My parents both smoke daily, do I want to be like they are, do I want to start an addiction that will never end. Again I say no but my whacked up head is un decided. I just learned tonight by myself how to light a lighter, but barely. What can go wrong or right? These questions lay in my head as I type downstairs on a sunday night. I will NOT smoke tonight or even tomorrow. The future lies ahead for me and my fate. The choices I make now will decide how the rest will turn out. Again I decide to say no. I will keep you updated on my life as it is in havoc mode because I am a sixteen out casted teenager with no life but a life to live.
