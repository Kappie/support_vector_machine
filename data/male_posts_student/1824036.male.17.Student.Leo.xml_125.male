So we went back to Wal-Mart to pick up her film...then went to see if my mom was in Fort Dodge with my spare key yet. She wasn't so we waited for a while on my car and then my mom came. After that we went to Wendy's and had an awesome talk.  I know now that no matter what happens, Hannah will be a GREAT friend. She will always be there for me. She will never betray me. I talked to her for an hour or so (from Wendy's all the way home, then in my driveway) about my dwindling relationship. She helped me out a lot. She made me feel really good despite knowing that my girlfriend doesn't love me as much as she loves another guy. She confirmed many things that I was scared about...but she also made me feel good because I knew she had been through this before as well.  She is so awesome. I love everything about Hannah. She is a great friend :)
