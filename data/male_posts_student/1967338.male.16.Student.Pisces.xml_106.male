Especially racing.  see the cars. see the cars go around in circles.  second to that is baseball. some times there are cool catches, slides, but reall, its just a guy hitting a ball and running a square. excuse me, diamond.      the weird thing is, my little sister enjoys watching me play video games.  I dont mind either, if the player is good, and the game a cool design and graphics, like Zone of the Enders.  this could be why one of my more favorible sports to eatch is tennis, for its similarity to pong.  That could be a new revenue, competitive professional video gaming. I hope so, because its a definate net if none of my other career possibilities fall through.    All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.
