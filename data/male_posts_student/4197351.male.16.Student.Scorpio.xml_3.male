O Yea, by the way if you are in THS, especially if you are on the leadership team, I am pissed off at you. We made teacher webpages yesterday, and by we I mean Sam, Jon H (NOT EVEN A TURNER STUDENT!!!!) and I, there were insufficient people and so nobody could keep teachers comming.... SO THANK YOU YOU UNGLY RETARD!  Anyway after that I came home and did some reading... I am now on philospher 5 of 19... and I am officially screwzored! Anyway... Adios
