When I turned on my TV and found the channel in question, suddenly my interest and high died. A random cop drama was using the song, which isn't a problem. the problem is: the image style, fades and editing were absolutely and completely ripped off from Donnie Darko too. surely creating a somewhat original mis en scene can't be that difficult.  no idea is original, but at least try to do something unique.
