I though that sounded neat, and it's not like I have much better to do on a Thursday night. And it  was  nice. They had, like, three guitar players who were  really  good and two singers what were very good as well. They mostly did country and blues stuff, which really isn't my type of music at all. But I usually find that talent is undenyableand more or less enjoyable on some level.
