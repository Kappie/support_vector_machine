She's always on my mind From the time I wake up, till I close my eyes She's everywhere I go She's all I know.  Though she's so far away, it just keeps getting stronger, everyday. And even now she's gone, I'm still holding on  So tell me where do I start, coz it's breaking my heart Don't wanna let her go  Maybe my love will come back someday, only heaven knows And maybe out hearts will find their way Only heaven knows And all I can do is hope and pray, coz heaven knows  My friends keep telling me, that if you really love her, you've gotta set her free And if she returns in kind, I'll know she's mine  But tell me where do I start, coz it's breaking my heart Don't wanna let her go  Maybe my love will come back someday, only heaven knows And maybe out hearts will find their way But only heaven knows And all I can do is hope and pray coz heaven knows why I live in despair coz why do we go dreamin I know she's never there And all the time I act so brave I'm shaking inside, why does it hurt me so?  Maybe my love will come back someday, only heaven knows And maybe out hearts will find their way, but only heaven knows And all I can do is hope and pray, coz heaven knows Heaven knows Heaven knows
