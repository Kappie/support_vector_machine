      I have a new addiction its called " urlLink Runescape ", and yes I guess I can save people alot of reading time by saying that its a MMORPG (Mass Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game). I really like it, mostly because you have a bunch of different skills you can learn. So everybody don't have to be the same. Plus it is really fun to have a bunch of people to help you.   P.S. - My name is commdata

      kill blogpost.exe
