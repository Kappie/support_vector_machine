I truly think all the teachers are constantly out to get me, but hey forget them, I'm done at West. Next year I will be going to central because I am to much of a failure I guess :-/.       Senior year is finally here, and I will be spending it with none of my friends. Hopefully I hang out with them out side of school. Hell, I cant even go to homecoming or prom, which is really bumming me out. I don't even know if I will be allowed to attend any of the sport games, if they don't let me hell will beak loose!       I just want to forget about this now, sorry I would post much more, but I have to help my friend who is very depressed.
