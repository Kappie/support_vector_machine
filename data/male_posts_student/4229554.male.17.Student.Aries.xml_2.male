In fact, probably the only two relationships I have had with somone my own age, have been the least emotional...the least anything. They just never set flight, there was never any common ground on which to build a relationship. I spent a couple of hours last night with a few friends, they were having a Halo "battle" whitch is actually a lot of fun, but just the little things they got so bent out of shape over. Everyone entering was constantly getting yelled at because they were in the way, being to noisy, or doing other unimportant, yet ultimantly life threatening actions. I just didn't get it, they are so crude, perverse, and self loathing. I may hate my life from time to time, but that doesn't inspire me to tell a group of 20 or so fellow peers how empty I feel! I just wish that It was easier for me to just subscribe to their self imploding mentality. But I can't, I enjoy doing things they would never understand. Sure I still harbor many of the "Invincibility" ideals characteristic of a 17 year old, But I enjoy things kids my age have not opened their eyes too. I live in a world where puberty hits at a younger and younger age while the growth of the intelectual adult is crippled by the lack of outside stimuli and the rebelious close-minded. The saddest part in all of this is that those kids, adults, whoever they are, that I get a long with, are the only ones that will not look past the fact that I should be: young, naive, and without philisophcal reasoning. So here I am, a 17 year old who probably understands the world to an extent of most 30 year olds. It has to be the hardest thing to be mature past your time. I get upset at things such as dishonesty, betrayal, and have little conflict over other, trivial, adolecent problems. I just wish, that for one day, I didn't have to be so idealistic, I could close my eyes and get drunk, do drugs, fuck as many girls as possible...but then again, this is who I am, and if did come down to it, I wouldn't change it for the world.
