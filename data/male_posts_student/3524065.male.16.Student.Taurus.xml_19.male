So now you're gone And I feel so empty Like a part of me has died Only to be resurrected When you return   I try to keep myself busy But you're on my brain I call you - but no answer How long till I see you again?   I keep thinking: If anything could happen now What would I want to happen? And the answer is the same everytime I wish for a knock And for my door to open And for you to be standing there Glowing with your usual aura of beauty I long for your touch The sweet sound of your voice And the moments we spend together Curled up together Am I asking for too much?
