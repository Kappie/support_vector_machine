Now here is where the fun begins, so maybe I might actually have something worthwhile to say.  Otherwise, Im still bored with my life.  The job hunt is rough, as there are either no jobs in the places I want to work, or there are openings in places I wouldnt be caught dead in... (food stuff)  Hopefully I will have my dream job at Borders soon.  Home Depot wouldnt be too bad, and Blockbuster?  If Tim and Nick can do it, so can I...  I just wish I were in a different state, physically and mentally.
