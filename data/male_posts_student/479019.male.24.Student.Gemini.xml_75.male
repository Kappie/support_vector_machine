I need to go out there and find an appartment, since the school convienently ended on-campus graduate housing this year. Talk about bad luck for me!? Anyway... I went to Outroads today to get an estimate on a ticket. $308... not bad. Hopefully housing isn't too hard to get.  Today was a whatever... statistics, lab, and meeting with my professor. He had a lot of good things to say about my paper. That's good stuff! I also went to see my buddies in Prymal Thrashing play in Middle Earth. That was cool. A chance to see familiar faces.  ***
