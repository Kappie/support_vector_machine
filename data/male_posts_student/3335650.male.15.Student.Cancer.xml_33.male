Sorry about last night, i'm not like that allwayz, therefore you have no reason 2 throw me out! =oP  Nothing intresting goes on particually in my life, I spend a damn lot of time on the computer! But you try living in a place where there are only towniez (a.k.a dings, charvers rudies, the lot) itz no fun! And i cant make any friends! *sniff* oh well, I gotz my hippy friends, from hippy school. =oP
