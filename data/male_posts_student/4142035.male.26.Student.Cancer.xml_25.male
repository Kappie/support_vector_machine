From Webster's  Domestic: 2 : of, relating to, or originating within a country and especially one's own country   3 : of or relating to the household or the family : devoted to home duties and pleasures  Partner: 2 a : one associated with another especially in an action :  urlLink ASSOCIATE ,  urlLink COLLEAGUE  b : either of two persons who dance together c : one of two or more persons who play together in a game against an opposing side 3 : either of two people living together; especially :  urlLink SPOUSE 3 : a member of a  urlLink partnership ; also 4 such memberships : one of the heavy timbers that strengthen a ship's deck to support a mast -- usually used in plural  So, if I live with someone, that would mean that I am that person's domestic partner. Though I have always been pretty sure of my heterosexuality. Also, a straight man and woman are domestic partners. But none of the stuff in Webster's Online Dictionary suggestions anything related to gayness.  Suspicious:1 : tending to arouse  urlLink suspicion  :  urlLink QUESTIONABLE 2 : disposed to suspect :  urlLink DISTRUSTFUL   3 : expressing or indicative of  urlLink suspicion     Traveler: 1 : one that  urlLink travels  : as a : one that goes on a trip or journey b :  urlLink TRAVELING SALESMAN 2 a : an iron ring sliding along a rope, bar, or rod of a ship b : a rod on the deck on which such a ring slides3 : any of various devices for handling something that is being transported laterally.  I see. So they're talking about those untrustworthy containers used to move things around to and from various places.  Just the phrase "suspicious traveler" makes it so you can pretty much attack any body who moves around and doesn't look right to you. Just like the word "terrorist."  Let's hear it for persecution!
