It was the last blog I did, but Matt suggested I take it down... never actually did reread it after I wrote it so I have no idea what its about. I was on about 4 tylenols before that because my stomach hurt like a  urlLink bitch  and I was just pissed off at everything. For those you haven't noticed, I am just linking random sites because I think its fun. Hey when you are  urlLink bored  you go to lots of sites just for fun. I noticed that when typing in random words into a search  urlLink engine  you get lots of funky  urlLink results . Oh yes and Matt, 33 degrees isn't anything. Sure it's hot, but I've been through worse so  urlLink XP . Let's see... what else is new. Oh I have a boyfriend. Have been going out for about a week and a half. I'm leaving tomorrow to  urlLink Europe , so I won't be able to talk to him. I don't really care because he was being an  urlLink ass   urlLink yesterday  and would rather not talk to him right now. Some people can be so  urlLink pigheaded . He can get way too cocky for his own good. Whatever, it doesn't matter. I leave for Poland tomorrow. Woooo fun... well actually I really would rather stay home. Yes I know  urlLink family  lives there, but I don't know any of them so it's like visiting strangers. I have to spend over 20 hours on a plane, so I'm not too happy about that. Just because it is first class, doesn't make it any better. Then there is always the waiting in airport time doing nothing and waiting for other plane so I can finally switch over. I have to switch 3 times... wooo! And we  urlLink fly  into Berlin in the end, so if we leave for Poland right away, it's another 3 or 4 hour car ride to my mom's old house. I really am going to take something to  urlLink read . I have no idea how many  urlLink books  I will want to take, or if I will read them all anyway, but as long as I have something to do them I'm fine. Which reminds me that I have to burn all my cd's today so I can have  urlLink music  to listen to while I fly. My guess is that I will just sleep on the plane, but who knows really. After 2 weeks in Poland I head to Paris for a week. I'm hoping that turns out good. The only problem I have is that I miss the first 2 days of school and course changes and everything. So if my courses are screwed up, I have to phone home and see what I can do about them. I hate my mom for the fact that I get home about midnight home time and then the next day I go to school, jetlag and all. So much fun. I'm tired and need to go  urlLink eat  now so blog most likely in 3 weeks or so. Byeeeee! -  Dark Lily  0>--}---
