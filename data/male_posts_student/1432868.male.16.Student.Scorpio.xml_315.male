Also, there has been some interesting trends as to what service they use. most of the Asians seem to use  urlLink Xanga  another group (more mixed but somewhat close nit) uses  urlLink Livejournal  and then me....using  urlLink blogger  service and possibly changing to movable type or similar. (of course it was through blogger I got my  urlLink Gmail  account so maybe I should stay loyal)Maybe I should either 1) get others to start using blogger or 2.) find a way (software) that would update all 3 (blogger, livejournal, xanga) at once and keep them in sync with eachother...actually that would be an awesome piece of software....hmmm I think it's time for me to learn some proper programming...
