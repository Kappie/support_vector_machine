As she put it, "they're just going to come here, put me in a box, and take me away."  The future is here. I feel optomistic about it, quite happy actually, but nevertheless it is bearing down on me. Furthur into the future, two peoples' lives will become intertwined, hopefully for the better. I have already commited myself to staying with her as long as possible, just as she has. We want to go to the same college in 2005, God willing. The best part about all this is that none of it phases me in the least. I could see myself like that.  It is now 12:00 AM, on Friday, June 4th. 3 days remain, and then all our love is put to the test.  But, I believe.
