"  You know, you can say what you want about you're whoever you consider a friend, but if they care, they will show it. You can only judge how great their friendship is by how they show it.  I know I have writen dedications to all my friends, but it is a completely different experience when they talk about you. Because when they show how much they care, it doesn't matter to you how they show it. But you only wish that you knew exactly what to say to make THEM feel that way. So then you show how you feel ..............again. And that cycle continues forever. It's only when that happens that you know you have made the greatest friends you could possibly have.        Thanks to ave and kaitlyn for those blogs. I was about to cry when I read them. I hope the cycle continues.
