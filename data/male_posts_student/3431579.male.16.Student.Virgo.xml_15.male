BAM! what the fuck is that? the only reason im pissed is because i had a feeling this would happen. i had a feeling that id get sick overnight and shed get better and the only reason that we couldnt chill was because i was sick. and here it is......... what the hell.......... i guess though, there is a brighter side to all this: the wait will make seeing her that much better. plus we're chilli on saturday AND sunday. we're going to a bbq (hopefully) on sunday at a mutual friends house. i dont know. im still mad happy even though i am sick and am not going to see her for like a day or so. fuck.....i sound so lovesick. i think that being with her is so great (even though its only been a wee and 3 days, 2 weeks on sunday) because we understand eachother so well. we both worry about the same dumb things that we dont have to and its just so "cute" how well we work together. this is by far the best relationship ive ever had. im so fucking happy...........   and on an un-julia related note:  apparently a great aunt of mine is dying. i dont even know her but my mom is pretty shook up about it. shes going to see her on thursday and coming home sunday. i feel really bad for her.
