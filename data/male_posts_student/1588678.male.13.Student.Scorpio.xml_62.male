Un-friggin'-believable! Uma + Quentin + Daryl Hannon = BEST MOVIE!!! Okay, lemme get to the point when I tell you about it.   The Directing - The absolute obvious; QT pulls it off! I'm telling you, ever little angle and distance of blood-spattering, ass-kicking, and eye-gouging was perfect. No one, I mean, NO ONE, does it like my man QT.   Dialog - Good but not great. It was better than Vol. 1. But wasn’t QT’s best dialog, c’mon, PULP FICTION, nothing beats it! I mean, that movie has classic quotes like “Now, now, lets not be sucking each others dicks quite yet.” I’m proved it with that one quote. Back to Kill Bill. So, to make it simple and easy, this one had good dialog.   Casting - Amazing. Uma kicked-ass! Darryl Hannon kick-ass AND got her ass-kicked in the process. And Bill, oh man, bad ass! And of course, Samuel L. Jackson as Rufus, Rufus is the man! None the less, great cast.   Battle Scenes - Lemme just say, as I sat back watching them, I was in awe, I couldn’t breath. I was shaking as I sipped on a Cherry Coke watching the amazing fights! Because I’m nice by not telling you a lot about the battles, the one with Uma Thurman and Darryl Hannon was bitchin’!!! Sweet jesus take me now! I was amazed. Just to give you all a small portion of the best battle in the move, it consists of EYE-GOUGING!!! How unbelievably cool is that, my friend?! Well, I wish I could tell you more, but I don’t wanna spoil it.   My Grade - Easier than wiggling my big-toe; I give it 5 out of 5 stars! Okay, maybe I’d settle better with a 4 1/2 stars better than 5, but still, this movie kick-ass!!!  I’m telling you, go sit your ass in front row and see this movie, because you ain’t gonna see Terantino perfect another kung-fu movie like this! Unless, oh man, do I hear a Vol. 3 in my head?! Well just have to wait and see.  MY TO-DO LIST: KILL BILL!
