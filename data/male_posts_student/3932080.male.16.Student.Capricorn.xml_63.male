Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink The Reason -Hoobastank  Peak  Billboard Hot 100  position: #2  The problem with  Hoobastank’s  “The Reason” isn’t that it follows vainly behind  3 Doors Down’s  “Here Without You” as a longing, somber ballad that will appeal to addicts and artists alike. It’s not the acoustic/electric guitar line that morphs into repetitive power chords either. Maybe the trouble with this crossover single is that vocalist  Doug Robb’s  lyrics are openly welcoming, so that they invite the listener into conversation, but also terribly contradictory, so that they lead to nothing but confusion. Observe:   Doug Robb:   I've found a reason for me to change who I used to be.   Listener:   Wait…if the person that you want to change is who you used to be, doesn’t that mean you’ve already changed?   DR:   I’m not a perfect person.   L:   So you admit to a gross lyrical error?   DR:   It’s something I must live with everyday.   L:   Oh, sorry.   DR:   I wish that I could take it all away.   L:   Oh, Doug, it’s not really that bad of a lyric…I mean, what’s your reason to want to take it away?   DR:   The reason is you.   L:   I’m gonna leave now.   The Verdict:  4.5/10 - Brouhaha   (2.25/5)
