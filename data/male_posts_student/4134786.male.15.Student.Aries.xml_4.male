Being the pro he is, he thought they were  chocolates  and shoved them into the fridge. I didn't know cos I was on the piano. He wouldn't have known if I didn't ask him to play the cds.  "Those were cds? I thought they were a box of chocolates."  Anyway, he got the entire  Candide  by Bernstein (the musical, not just the overture), and Elgar's 2 symphonies + the  Cockaigne  Overture - in London town - and  Sospiri  (Sighs). Nice large round pralines with small holes in them. And embedded pits and bumps too!  lol later we boliaoed around with the Coke. Laughed and almost blew it. Really boliao afternoon.
