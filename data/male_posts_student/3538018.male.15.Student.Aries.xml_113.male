Like I said in my last blog, at least it is in the states this time...but still.  I dont want to go camping and Im SO tired of living out of a suitcase/pack.  SO tired of traveling and I know a lot of you are saying "I wish I could get out of this place."  But think about it for 5 secs...Ive been gone overseas for 3 weeks...im home for 4 days, and now im gone again for another week AND THEN my mom wants to go to OK for a couple days RIGHT AFTER we get home from Colorado.  UGH, for the first time ever I think I just want to be somebody that stays home and does nothing...sick of traveling.  Thats the big thing.  So yeah since Ive been home things have been going great and thats another thing that makes me mad.  Right when I get used to being home and seeing everyone I have to go again.  Eh, whatever.  Enough complaing about that.   Parents, first time in this blog that they have been talked about extensly but I think today is so fitting to start.  So my dad finally got on a project again where he has to go every week and be gone from the house.  I say finally because things run so much smoother around the house when he is not around and there are so many less fights (like praticallly none) when he is not around between me and my parents.  My dad complicates things, thats the long and short of it...when he is around, the whole house is a lot more tense and yeah...its just that way.  He never lets loose...i mean i love him, thats a given.  I just think that he tenses the house and complicates things a lot more than they should be.  Tonight being a perfect example of this.  Last night home (again) and Meeta and I just want to spend the night together.  Well, you can tell that my dad is like all up tight about having company over.  Well me and Meeta see that and decided to leave for an hour or so and let them finish whatever they are doing or what have you.  Well that was the best hour of the night let me tell you.  We get back, dad still in the same tense mood but now mom has tensed up too because of my dad.  So mom says something and Meeta is forced to go home at 930...errrrr....I was done packing so yeah, I dont know why but w/e....there you have it...an example with my opinions. So yeah, today was pretty mellow with nothing really going on.  Went out to lunch with Greg and came back here and chilled for a while...that was pretty cool.  Other than that and the night (which i already talked about) nothing happend...chilled with Nate for the first time in a long time and yeah...thats it. Right now theres really someone that is making me get through the days with a smile on the whole day and yeah...is just being really great to me and I really dont know why.  Honestly, all ive been doing recently is being gone.  Thats it.  For a month now i will have been gone (cept for the four days that i was home this week) and yeah...it just keeps getting better and better.  I feel like I can tell her anything...it makes me feel so complete when I am around her.  Its so great having someone there that I can just talk to and I actually know that shes listing and not just blowing me off.  Not saying that I think people do (but I know some do) but yeah, its just different when I am around her and its a very good different.  I am just so happy to have her and consider myself so lucky to be with her.  She really is great =) Alright well I guess Im gonna end this one.  My next update will be in a week for sure cuase i know there is no computer access in the Rockies.  Cell phone will be on if I have signal.  Call if you need me, I dont roam anywhere in the states.  Aight, lata days.
