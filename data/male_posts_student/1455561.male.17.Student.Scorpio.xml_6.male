"hey were are you going in such a hurry, slow down" - some of the more sinister words a 6 foot 8 body builder can tell you ( just in between "where the f**k is my adrenaline injection" and "get out of my house").  he then explained that he was selling these tiny book things full of "cool" stuff for a charity called something like "happysmile" or something and that we could buy one of the very thin, fading, cheap booklets for just £2.  which was in my judgement around £1.99 more than it cost to make.  we were both obviously very willing to buy his book  upon close inspection we discovered that the charity had one of the worst logos of any charity ever ( a clipart smiley face) and the picture of the wheelchair they were buying looked like it had been one of da vincis rejected inventions.  oh well, we had been conned, he was probably off buying energy drinks as we spoke.  we felt conned anyway.  however about an hour later this guy was still on the highstreet getting more people to "buy my book" so we began to think that maybe we had given money to an actualy charity.  surprisingly the charity is actually registered and whats more, the book was full of the most hilariously tragic poetry sent in buy other buyers of the book ( mostly teenagers like us)  i almost felt inclined to send in some of my own ridiculous poetry about pretending to be depressed. maybe with a subtext of buying a shitty book of a body builder but that is always hard to try to slyly filter in.  for one nothing rhymes with builder.  i wonder if the charity ever realised that it only ever got sent depressing poetry cos everyone who bought the book felt conned out of £2
