I dont'  have to work tomorrow, I'll just take a nap this afternoon. Nope.  At 9AM Gabe from CompTech calls me and says Matt called in sick. You need to  work today.  What the hell is that. So I took a nap this morning amounting to about 4  hours and headed off to work at 2. Now not only am I tired and pissed off  like I thought I would be, but now I'm tired and pissed off while I work on  peoples' computers. No fun here. My boss even bitched at me how computers  were moving slow when I'm only here 2 of 6 days a week. And last weekend I  was tied up mostly with getting backed up files onto a laptop. This guy only  knew what he wanted back on there. Not where it was, not what it was called,  he didn't understand what I was doing, and I didn't have any clue what he  wanted. I got him all fixed up, but it sucked up most of my hours. But  computers aren't moving, and it's my fault.  I wonder if Safeway is hiring?
