Its pretty expensive though, 13 dollars a ticket at the door!! I am going to video tape so it should be to bad.  I had to work today. 1-3. That isn't to bad. Didn't really have to do anything so. I have to work tomorrow morning 9-1. Last night we didn't do to much. We drove around but  nothing really happen. Couple pull overs and a underage drinking party, but they didn't do anything.  Well I guess that's about all for now. I'll try to update later tonight. "ERIC"
