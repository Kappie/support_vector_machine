Lately I'm getting addicted to his "Moondance" song, and for those who think that Clay Aiken is the only guy that can sing, check out this guy. And he doesn't need powerful vocals to express himself.  Back to my life. Someone said today that my blog is too confusing to read. In fact, almost literary. I apologise for that too, but it is my style and I like the way I'm handling this blog, though it's boring since I have only text, text and more text to show.   I won't forget the last time I had slight depression, and I don't think I will ever hit that level of emotion again, but lately stuff hasn't been going my way and it is unfortunate to know that most of it has been my fault.  Contradictory to popular belief, I am not a calm person - I am in fact struggling inside.  Surely things will get better.
