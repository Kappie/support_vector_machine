Two eggs made to order, turkey sausage patties, and three pancakes and their 100% pure maple syrup.......Its sooo good, i wish i could eat it every day but if  i did im sure id have a heart attack by the time im 28....They have lots of other good stuff too, biscuits and gravy, grits made to order, and thats just their breakfast ! They have lots of stuff for dinner and lunch but I only eat breakfast there.....if you are looking for a good breakfast way better than IHOP then go to Cracker Barrell !! Its the best!
