First off I had to stay in the very back part of a truck with a camper on it for like 4 hours and it was all hot and sweaty and dirty. Next we get to the hotel and that's all cool and stuff, I swam a little and today I found out I could get internet going on my laptop which is way coolio. But other than that it has sucked, I had to meet my stepmom's side of the family who were all total hicks and really old and fat. We all met at Ryan's Family Steak House which didn't go well with my stomach. I had a stomach ache this morning from the hotel breakfast. anyways omgosh it was nasty, I was watching this one fat chick eat and FOOD FELL ON HER BOOBS and she didn't even realize till a minute later. I almost gagged, I felt so out of place being tan and not fat. I don't know if I should feel bad for feeling superior because I getting weird feelings of like being better than someone. I shouldn't get that feeling right but really it disgusted me and that I disgusted myself for feeling like Hitler. but yeah I miss people already and this is going to be a long five weeks lmao. Here I am in the hotel lobby writing this down and not having as good a time as I should be having. Hopefully NC will be much better to me.   Well there are some good things that have happened to me so far. I bought a couple of decks of cards so I can play "poophead" which is totally awesome and I also bought some uno cards and I have been playing that with my brothers which is fun until they start being buttheads about it. I got some gatorade and I got to swim and my huge summer problem is now just a minor summer problem. My mom got me some different shaving gel lol and a razor that prevents razor burn which I guess is what I had. I tested it out last night and now my belly is back to smooth, but still the red bumps prior are there but no more irritation so yeah that turned out good. I'm hoping for a fun vacation and it will definately get better when I get back home. All of this traveling would be much more fun if I had a friend along but no just my brothers and family. mk well see ya later.
