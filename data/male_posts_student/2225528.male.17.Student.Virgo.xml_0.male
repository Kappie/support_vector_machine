Like...when you first started having memories? Disturbing isn't it? We know from modern science that you couldn't possibly have memories as a newborn child, but still...don't you ever wonder where you were before you were born? We justify ourselves today by recalling the past and yet where we before all our memories started? Some staunch religious people may say, "Heaven, or purgatory." Yet it all seems vague to me.    Try and think back to your earliest memories, as a child maybe. In your mother's arms. Before that? And before that? Getting cloudy now, right? As hard as we try, nothing seems to come up to before we started having memories...before we were born. That's exactly what I'm talking about, "Where do our sub-conscious thoughts, or memories, lie before we exist?" A question that's been haunting me for seven years. And it still is. Hmm...something to think about in bed tonight, no?    it's the same thing as asking, "Hey, how many times do you blink in a day?" and seeing the person suddenly becoming aware of his blinking. Humorous and entertaining.
