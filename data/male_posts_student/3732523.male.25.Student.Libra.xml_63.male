Tell one thing that happened to you in that year (if you grab a coin with a year before you were born find another one :) ).  2003?  What a weird year.  I went back for what I assumed was my last term of university, taking 6 courses.  Algorithms, Social Ecology (philosophy arts elective), Stats, Computer Networking, Programming Languages and Numerical Methods.  I pass everything, but stats, which I needed to graduate and only failed by a couple of marks.  The prof wouldn't help me out a bit, that rotten *****.   What comes to mind first when you hear the word "reality"? Why?   The word reality usually makes me thing of an old roommate of mine.  He was this little dorky kid my last year of residence that I lived with.  He needed a huge reality check.   What is the most honest thing you have done?  I try to live my life as honestly as possible.  When I was 12, I turned in a purse I found on the sidewalk to the police station (which was at the bottom of the hill) without opening it or checking out what was in it.   What do you like to do most with a free hour? Why?  With a free hour, I use it to watch TV.  I don't watch a lot of TV.  I try to fit in an hour of the Simpsons or something that usually makes me laugh.   If you could smash one thing and one thing only, what would you smash? Why?   I've always wanted to smash a plate glass window, with my body being the thing smashing through it.   For what do you think you would be willing to lay down your life? Why?  I would gladly put myself on the line for family members or friends or something that I firmly believed in.   What one word would you put on your gravestone? Why?  Oi! Because you never knew what life would throw your way.   What TV advertisement bothers you the most? Why?  This new ad for Holiday-In Express that has Alex Trebek doing this gay jeopardy situation.  This guy who hasn't gotten past grade 7 has like 17,000 dollars, one guy is at 0 and the other person is at -200.  The guy brags about how he stayed at a holiday in express the night before.  It's stupid and on all the time.   What was your first job?  I mowed lawns for people.  It was great.  It taught me responsiblity and my parents never needed to give me money from May til Oct.   Finish the sentence: “I have never...”  done one of these things before.
