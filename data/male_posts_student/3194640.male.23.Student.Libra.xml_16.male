My wife is constantly telling me she's told me things, but I don't know if she has because I may not have heard her say them. I know that she repeats things that she's already told me because she didn't remember whether she's told me or not. Most of the things she says that she's told me I don't remember hearing, but because I don't listen all the time I don't really know what she's told me and what she hasn't. For all I know she's already told me that she's going to play mind games and tell me that she going to tell me that she tells me things that she hasn't. The problem is I probably wasn't listening when she told me.  About something important:  I AM THE TACO EATTING CHAMPION!   Last night I managed to beat a co-worker of mine in a taco eatting contest. While he stopped at 12 tacos, I was able to eat 14. Thankfully, I didn't get as stuffed as I did the last time. The last time we had to stop at 12. My co-worker says he could have eatten more and that he  LET  me win. I guess we'll never know. We'll more than likely have a rematch because he can't just lose because he lost. I don't believe that he lost because he wanted to, he lost because he  COULDN'T  win. Next time I'll remember to bring the camera so you can see me stuffing my face with tacos.  Now about  urlLink Michael Moore  again...  Thanks to  urlLink MooreWatch.com  I've got some moore recommended articles for you to read about America's (apparently) favorite movie,   urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11  . These are quite interesting:   urlLink Andrew Ferguson 's article at  urlLink Bloomberg.com    urlLink Mark Steyn 's article at  urlLink The Telegraph    urlLink Thomas Frank 's article as published in  urlLink Newsday   Then when your done, check out  urlLink this article  from  urlLink The Boston Herald . I liked this one, too.  I'm a fan of  urlLink MooreWatch.com . I was disappointed yesterday when I couldn't get on the web site. Apparently, the website was  urlLink attacked  by "Moore-ons" (Please be aware of possibly offensive language).
