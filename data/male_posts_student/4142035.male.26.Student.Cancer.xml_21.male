Gays aren't able to love each other like straight folks, so they can't offer a child the same love a straight couple could. Marriage is a heterosexual institution, and them homos are edgin' in on our territory!!!  And my personal favorite: They're just getting married for the TAX BREAKS! What kind of freakin' idiot would dedicate him/herself to another individual and work to live out the rest of their days with them just to get a fucking tax break? The pay off is not worth the effort! Even the supposedly morally-devoid gay population of the world knows that. And if certain gay folks DO get married for the tax breaks, I doubt the validity of their existence.  When are people going to drop this? Here's my argument: Homosexuality isn't the problem. Marriage is. Marriage is a great example of government support of the crossing of church and state, which is a big no-no in America. And the religious ritual of marriage is encouraged by financial support from the state to the married. There are other ways to support people who want to have families or be married.  Derrick declares: from this day on, there will no more marriages! (note: not official law in the United States)
