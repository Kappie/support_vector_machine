And right now, I just feel that I'm losing control of my own life. But that's no problem, cause most of the time I would be able to gather it back. But there are just certain things I wish to address.  As many who know me would know that I just camp back from the Youth Retreat. And to be honest, despite the many changed lives and people, and people who thoroughly enjoyed and learned from the camp, my experience was a totally different one. It was probably one of the worst camps I've ever been to. Not in terms of planning or the work done by the commitee, but rather my role during the camp as group leader, and the discouragement I get so often.  It started out with that terribly barren population of my group (this is no offence to my ex-group members), which already removed half my heart for excitement during the camp. Then the next day, I got really fed up, cause it's so hard to be a friend to people and at the same time a group leader. I was angry with people, but more with myself. And all the 'like here like there' thingy (my sister refers to it this way) really destroys my day. To be honest, I think that adolescent 'love' is probably pure infatuation and selfish foolishness, I know that by saying this, I offended like 99.99% of my close friends (that's if I ever had any), but I don't care, cause that's what I think. I'm not talking this in a bias viewpoint. In fact, I didn't say this because I just had a rejection from someone I really 'like', but instead, it's quite the opposite.  I shall now officially leave the topic of camp. And now, I have a confession to make. A big one. One that's probably an invitation to a one to one personal time with almost everyone who reads this entry. Here goes...For this past year, I've had two mutual crushes. Don't mind me using the word. I don't believe in adolescent 'love' anymore, although I should have thought better than to believe in something so 'fairy tale' in the first place. One lasted  10 months and another a week. And just a moment ago, I felt terrible and guilty and was faced with the: 'She needs you more from both people.' You know, at this point of time, you just want the whole world to tell you that you're a sinful scumbag who is heartless and deserves all condemnation possible. That would have made me feel better. Instead, every single person I talked to said I did the right thing and at least I was honest and all. Oh...brother... But now, I've made up my mind and I'm telling myself that I'm never going to like another girl (I'll just perish all thoughts concerning anything like it) for 5 years. That'll help. It's not that hard after having made the same mistake with two different people. Disclaimer: This two people are great people, but my heart is now hardened and I shall not let them take any romantic position in my life which I feel is hardly possible even if I allow them to, since adolescent 'love' is just a lie that you want to spend the rest of your life with someone. *quote*love or not love, true love, such a thing is too early to be possible for us.*unquote*  I don't understand why people fall out with people. You know, like why can't the whole world be friends? I know the problem is sin. But everyone things that it's the other person. Partly, I mean totally, that's due to sin too. But people just tend to be selfish, don't they? I often feel that the young people (around my age) are separated into two factions. There's a group that is the 'in' group. Supposedly better looking and the more well dressed and fun people to be with, and the more quiet, if not less popular people that only just want to have friends. (forgive me...) This are just my thoughts, nobody said they are or were true. Ok...this is out of point. I think I just wanna express my unhappines.  I was at the Music Camp Concert on Sunday night. And looking at the kids, I realised that innocence is so precious, and is something that should be well treasure. With innocence, all you want is fun and be happy. As someone said, 'You just like this person *full stop*' 'Love' would be ten times more fun, and also, in case of self conciousness, it is practically non-existent. I mean I went just where a Batman costume and walk about the street without worry about being laughed at if only I still there much of innocence. It'll be silly to say that I am not innocent at all, cause if you say that you are, you're probably too innocent. But I do feel that I'm innocent, but still not enough to be the inner child inside of me, which I would like to deny that is 16 years old.  Ok...last of all. I still love God and He has control over my life. After all this, all the more so. I've sort out my thoughts, my life is God, that's my decision. Soli Deo Gloria!
