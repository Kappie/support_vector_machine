I think there is something wrong with the MK machine.  It freezes up and the Player One buttons don't work.  I did install coin door locks.  That's all I know how to do right now.  Still searching for documentation or something; anything to learn how to fix these darn things.  Work has been 'non-stop problems'....We have had tons of work to do and not enough strength to muster up for compeltion.  Problem, like dial-in access and running low on printer toner, ahhh, tons of shit.  Not even enough time to play a game or two of Counter Strike.  The Art show is nearing quickly.  I am looking forward to it, OH SHIT!  I just remember that we need one more band for the outdoor stage.  No Forms yet.  No articles yet,  no idea what is gonna go down!  My legs HURT so bad from doing lots of leg press, squats, hamstring curls. and those leg extentions.  I can hardly walk right,  I need some ICyhot rubbed all over my legs.  Later flizzo's   the ghost - ive been rocking out to these guys this morning
