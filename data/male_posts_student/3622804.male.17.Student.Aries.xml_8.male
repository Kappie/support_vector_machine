At 10:45 i was already in the clementi macdonalds together wif moggy and dere we waited till arnd 11 for kiellne,jak,sarefin and ivan..we were supposed to eat lunch dere but den since i saw some fellow schoolmates dere, i feel kinda uneasy to go walk and order food..dey kept looking at us.So den frm dere we when to catch a train to harbourfront to meet wif the organiser and the rest of the ppl cosplaying..good thing was dat most of the cosplayers dere i kinda noe so dun feel so left out..lol..but too bad never see anyone cosplay characters frm one piece..dere was one gal doin ino frm naruto though..but such a snob..wad a bitch..  Luckily when we reach sentosa the first place we went to were to BK so can haf lunch dere. So while i was eating most of the cosplayers were dressing up and stuff and soon i was helping dem to take pictures and stuff..den i went to play wif deir weapons and stuff..so cool..onli tat the BK was kinda crowded and ppl keep staring at us..but tat makes it fun..in a way i guess..^^  After BK we went to some garden and dey were snapping pictures again and stuff so i was taking some sightseeing myself..sad thing was dere a fren of mine broke her nicely done keyblade..:(..cannot play wif it animore..Den we move out to go to the beach but den stop halfwae infront of the merlion and haf a break,den suddenly jak said she lost something so den i help her search arnd and ran all da way back to look but still cannot find..ask her whether she got check the ppls bag and she said yes..so den we tot it was gone for good until she found it wif sarefin..and den it was told tat jak gave the thing to her to hold for awhile when the keyblade was broken back at the garden...-_-...so lame rite...run arnd and retracing my steps for nthing..  Den after da break we went to da beach and den dey go snapping pics again while i took out my precious wakka ball and started playing some games wif those other ppl..den a guy volunteered himself to get buried in the sand so we all bury him and took a grp picture behind him..lol...its was like so funny..seeing his face like tat..anyway by tat time it was like 6 plus to den some of us including me decided to go home so we went to make our way..wahlao..must say tat the trip back was boring and irritating on the monorail..took as long as 25 mins wif tat irritating voice telling history and stuff..like any ppl wan to hear like tat..Den actually wanted to go dinner wif ivan and kiellne but den got no money already..:(..so went home lor..den took a bathe and started writing this post while waiting for damian to come online to go play gb..but dun think can last long..mega tired liaoz....
