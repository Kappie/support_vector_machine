Saturday i woke up around 9, and chilled till about 1030 then went to my uncles house and then straight to the Skin Factory, got more added to my original tattoo. after that we chilled at the pool then went to the Texas and ate dinner and fucked around for a few hours until 10 and then went bowling to celebrate my aunts birthday. she may be 40, but she still partys like a teenager, by thega 2nd me she could barely walk...it was great. after that, came bck to our hotel and slept, woke up around 730 today and started home around 9...yeah so that was my trip....see ya'll around...hey..somebody write a damn comment every once and a while...damn...lol peace er'one
