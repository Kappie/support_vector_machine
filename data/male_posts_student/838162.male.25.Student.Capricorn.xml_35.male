It’s not 100% but should fit my needs as long as I don’t trip over the newly (badly) positioned power cables.  Basically, close to three weeks ago. My system started getting increasingly frequent lockups, strange Operating System errors and Data corruption. I managed to work through most of them, vowing to get to the bottom of it once my exams are over. However 3 days before my papers, the system suffered a series of crashes that resulted in system memory failure and my hard disk partitions totally corrupted. It was quite a large blow to me as my exam revision includes large amounts of online data, but also an emotional blow as I always believed in myself to be able to troubleshoot these types of problems, especially in such an important occasion as it was. Not to mention the finances used in replacing the RAM module. I took this opportunity to submit a upgrade proposal to my sponsors as it was passed in the last meeting that upgrading was needed. However current budget constrains did not permit it at the time. I had to make do with what I had.   I had assumed that the problem was caused by the faulty memory, but after installing it, I found out it was only a part of the problem. Midway through reinstalling my programs and data, the whole system crashed once again.   Something else was wrong.  I spent the rest of that week trying to chase down the problem and finally narrowed it down to a power problem, one of the most overlooked and arcane of computing problems. I replaced my power supply with a newer, more reliable brand and proceed to reinstall.  After 30 hours, the problems resurfaced.  I was at my wits end. It left only two other areas that would be the cause. The power strip that supports my workspace, or the wall socket.     Well to cut a long story short (actually I think it’s a little too late for that) I bought a new power strip and it didn’t really work. It was better but not good enough. In the end I had to stretch the power cables to my other power strip that would result in my cables tripping up people if not careful. I’m praying that this is only for awhile until a more permanent fix is found, such as installing a new wall socket closer to my workspace.  After all this I am back online and it looks like I have a lot of catching up to do. Bare with me everyone, FalchionEdge is back.
