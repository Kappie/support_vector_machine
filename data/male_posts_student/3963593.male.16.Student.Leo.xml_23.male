The day of my birthday my dad picked me up from football, and we went directly to the DPS and got my license.  Then we went to grab a bite to eat at Sonic, and it just so happens that the Sonic was next door to the little resteraunt that my parents were getting food at when my mother went into labor with me exactly 16 years earlier, that was just kinda cool, and mind boggling to think about how cool of a coincidence it was.  I've been driving for a few days now, and I already feel realy comfortable behind the wheel.  I crank up the stereo and go speeding down the road.  I do my best to keep at the speed limit, but it's always fun to break the rules a little, but I stay cautious.  So far I've only driven to work and football practice, so I still need an excuse to go out for the hell of it just to hang out with friends.  O ya, and also today, I went to Magnolia Cafe today with Tim.  That was good, but I couldn't finnish my food,  two eggs, four triangles of toast, spanish rice, and two GIANT pancakes is a lot of food!  Any way, today I finnished my last day of work at Pancho's, and I'm glad it's over, but still kind of sad, because I had a great time with all of the new friends I made there.  I hate bitter sweet emotions, it's hard to know what to feel.  Well, thats it for now... more to come.
