I want to study hard this half of the year, I want to be a testimony, a Student Christian, that my identity would be always a Christian. And I've adopted a new activity, reading. Never did much of that, but I'm starting now, and come to realise the treasure in books. Besides that, I'm planning to work on my clarinet more.   There's nothing much to say, cause they're all reflected in my review. So hope that I'll make wise decisions and let the Lord guide me in my life.
