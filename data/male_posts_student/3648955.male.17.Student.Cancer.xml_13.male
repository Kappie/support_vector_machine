It wasnt like totally bad it was just extremely boring cause we didnt even get a chance to do anything till maybe later in the night, but that turned out to suck as well.  Started in the late afternoon at about 4 PM when we finally left the house. It was hard to not get angry, but i only thought about myself, not realizing that in about a day or two, that we have to move everything. But still, it did tick me off.  We finally left, did basically nothing. Started heading out of Long Island because my mother wanted to see the aparment that we plan on moving into. Supposedly it has the following features which are listed below in no specific order. These are only details that I myself have heard so far...  - 7 closets - 2-3 bedrooms - walk-up dining room - white marble floors  And thats basically all i heard. The only detail that caught my eyes were the white marble floors. In the house here, the floors suck. Its not anything like old floors or something like that, but its granite. Basically granite floors are cheap flooring that looks good. Plus granite stains very easily, so if u spilt soda or something and it sat there for say 5 minutes accidently, you get a nice big stain. It tends to go away if you wash it constantly, but its a bit weird how it stains. The stain seems as if its totally INSIDE the granite, you cant even feel the stain or anything, yet if you scrub it, it gets removed. I dont know the particular science within them. Another reason to disrespect what Earth Science class lacks in grade school.  Anyway, on the way there, we had to stop at Wendy's cause since my brother David is diabetic, he had to get certain amounts of foods per day, so we went to get food. Of course me and my mother were arguing because i still havent forgotten how much of a liar she is, and how no one got me anything for my birthday.  So before we got a chance to actually leave the border of Long Island, my mother calls my Aunt (who lives in the same building... along with my cousin... and my sister... and my other aunt... and my grandpa and where my grandma USED to live before she died r.i.p...), to ask her if the people who used to live in the aparment (the previous Super, in whcih you know the apartments going to be nice since hes the super), whether or not that theyre there so we can see the apartment. Apparently they werent, so we didnt end up going there. My mom kept on driving towards there though since its near Austin St. which is basically the shopping Mecca of Forest Hills. I used to live there, only some things changed. About 15 new stores since i last went there. There really isnt any shopping that intertests me at all... except for the giant Barnes and Nobles. Thats about it. Actually theres a Staples too, so two stores that strike my fancy.  So anyway, we're driving down that way, we recently have driven over there just to see how the neighborhood turned out since way back when. Apparently the same kinda people, but a short bombardment of other people (ethnic wise). No im not racist, its just an observation. But towards the other side of the town, like the eastern part of town where the rest of the places were, are very odd and weird people. Luckily we're near the shopping. I just really cannot stand to be in an apartment or that area. Its not like its a bad area, but im used to living in areas where the houses are big and spacious and everything is secluded and suburban like. Over there its very urban-suburbish, in a way. Its not my kinda thing, but i have no other choice.  Supposedly when im there, my sister and cousin will be taking me out a lot. SUPPOSEDLY. Yea sure if my mom pays them enough. I dont like disrespecting my sister, but the girls 24 and she works at Keyfood and asks my mother for money constantly. My cousin who is only 2 years older than her has a child, supports her, and has a job. It boggles my mind. Heather (my sister) is not stupid at all, shes just lazy.  I havent seen my tutor in awhile either. Im sure when we move, he'll start coming. Cant wait for that. I feel so lonely with no friends at all or anyone to talk to. Hes so much better than getting a therapist if i do say so myself. I dont need any therapist or psychologist up my ass, even though i do find the profession quite intriguing. Ive thought about that as a profession (a secondary one). I really would like to minor in psych.  So anyway, as we're passing through Austin street, my mom was fancying all the new stores... and of course her being a woman, admiring all the girlish stores such as the new opened Sephora. I really cannot stand it when im wither her and she wants to go to a womanly store. Im sensitive, but not that sensitive when im '''WITH MY MOTHER'''....  I usually sit in the car when im out. I only go with them so i can get out of the house and get some air. I love sitting home on the computer, and this is why i prefer getting a laptop. I get some nice air. I do open the window, but never during the summer due to the high traffic of bugs, so its a bit secluded. Its nice though sometimes, i can still open the shades...  So while we're passing through Austin street, we decide to just go back towards Long Island. It had been about an hour or two from there cause we were just strolling around parts of town.  We get towards Long Island and my mom wants to go to the supermarket in Little Neck. So she heads in. I sat in the car because i did not want to go in. So she goes in with David and i relax in the car with my dog. I was sitting and reading my book.  The book im reading is extremely enjoyable. Its a great book compared to some others that i have read. Its called "In This Skin" and its by Simon Clark. On the cover, a comment by someone had said that Simon Clark has what it takes to become the next Stephen King. Simon Clark has also won 2 British Fantasy Awards. Im not sure what they are, but an award is an award. Its good. It started out extremely boring, but as you get in at about page 50 or so as an estimate, it gets to the part where it discusses the villian of the book which ill only describe as not human and freaky. Im at about page 125 of the book and its gotten good. There has only been about 2 parts so far that have really gotten me to show some live emotions when reading. Usually that does not happen to me unless im reading some paper on line about programming or security in which i show emotion like "Ohhh now i see", or "Ahh... yea", or even "Well yea obviously...". Emotions in that manner.  They finally come out, stuff their groceries into the car. By then i think it was about 7 :30 after stopping at a candy store since my mother had to get cigarettes for my father and me stopping to get some Ice cream from this place which took about 20 minutes just for fucking 3 pints of ice cream. So we get there, we're relaxed and then all of a sudden the girls come (Heather, Jill (my cousin) and Jill's daughter). I didnt really have any emotion at all in my face because i was a bit ticked off when i saw them because i of course knew that the only reason they came was because Heather wanted money. My mother supposedly gave her only $20. Usually my mother gives her about $60-100 for the week. The most my mother ever gave me when i was under 13 was $20, so that must of been just pocket change in her eyes. Im 17 now, and i dont at all ask for money. I have no where to go to spend the money. I have no one to go WITH to spend the money. Therefore, i do not need money. Lucky for my mother i have nothing to do with my life at the moment until im in College which im hoping occours otherwise i will disown her for life and kill myself.  At the moment its about 2:49 AM making it tomorrow, which is July 5th. I cant believe that 2 days ago i turned 17. It passed by so fast. That reminds me a part of the entry that i didnt mention. While we were out getting ice cream, we were searching for fireworks. We couldnt find any. We were following the sound of bundles of them, and my mother was driving through Kings Point which in reality is 5 paces away from our block since we're right on the border, and we go allllllll the way up to where we heard them, and apparently it was way up to where the Kings Point Merchant Marine Academy was. We noticed all these people walking down the street like a miniature parade of people going home. We then came to the conclusion that it was just a celebration of some sort at the Academy. My mother made a U-Turn and asked a man politely from the window whether or not there were fireworks. The man responded in a strong accent that it was finished. That gave us the signal to sigh and go home.   So anyway, im here now. Its 2:51 AM and im a little bit on the drowsy side. Usually id be extremely energetic and active since im not much of a sleeper and partial an insomniac by self diagnosis. My mother gave me some Bennedryl. That will surely knock me out. Its for allergies apparently. I myself am a sufferer of allergies so it does me double the relief.  We really need to hurry with the packing. The movers come on Tuesday and considering that its almost 3 in the morning, and technically Monday, the movers will be coming tomorrow. My mother has to quickly hire a lady to clean whats left of the house. Not everything is even packed. I still have the computer on my desk. Most of my things are packed though. I do not even have much anymore. We've moved so many times that half my room is missing. So therefore i only need about 3-4 boxes to completely clean out my room. One of them being my clothing. I dont have much clothing anymore either. My style dramatically changed anyhow, so i buy new things ;).  In the morning, we're surely going to pack everything quickly. Im sure we're not going to go out or anything since theres so much work to do. I will definetly not unplug all the computer parts until the movers arrive so i can tell my friends that i wont be on for a bit. Im HOPING that the fucking cable modem comes quickly. Im really not entirely sure whether or not she made the order for that. Plus its going to be Roadrunner, its not even as fast as Optimum Online. Plus, my main computer still suffers from network failure and my damn Windows XP CD will not accept the key. Its a great Cd actually. My friend let me download it from him. Its an 8 in 1 windows CD. I despise windows, but its still a convienence (PROGRAM WISE ONLY, bastards cant make everything linux compat.).  I did however happen to download the Gentoo 2004.1 LiveCD. So even though my Windows main has network failure, that will not at all affect Gentoo since it has its own drivers and file system. Its still going to be a wonder how i plan on getting the modem to work with it. But it then comes to my attention that i can download VMWare on the Win98 box, burn that to a cd, transfer to the main WinXP box, and then do it through there and actually save the shit, rather than a LiveCD where the data will become nothing more than zero's in /dev/null. Ill possibly do that -=).
