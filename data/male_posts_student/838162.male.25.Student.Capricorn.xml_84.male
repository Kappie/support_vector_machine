It's now a full website with blogging features of course.  In anycase, I put up the  urlLink Writings  section with one story for a start. I'm looking it fill it up with some stuff over the next few weeks. Hopefully it would look filled out before the start of next year where things really get busy for me over here.  In any case, if anyone got feedback on the stories, feel free to drop me a line.
