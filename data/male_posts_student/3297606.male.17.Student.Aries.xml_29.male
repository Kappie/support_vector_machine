TAKING BACK SUNDAYS NEW CD!!! WIAKA WAKKA! man its so crazy awsome. it hasent even come out yet but i got the whole thing being the elite pirate i am. Its not like it matters though, im going to buy their CD when it comes out regardless, just to support their majesty.  so yea i havent posted in a long time, but thats because ive been spending my time on things like painting myself orange and telling people that they are weird.  ill try to start up again, but if i dont post again for another cricket dont spam me with HE grenades.
