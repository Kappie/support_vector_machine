Years of incoherent thought have withered away. But here in I leave behind Hieroglpyhs for Vagabonds and Knights alike.  What do I intend to acquire out of this escapade; I haven't figured out as of yet. Maybe the verbal diarrhea may release a variant of oxytocin into my system. Or maybe it's agorophobia getting the better of me. How and where does one get from here?   Along the way I read it's never 'Why me?' rather 'Why not me?' To be kicked in the nuts over and again is what life the bitch does best... And the abhorrent, arrogant, egoist that I am I learn things my way.
