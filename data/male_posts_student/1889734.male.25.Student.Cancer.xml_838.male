The cause is still uncertain, but an infection seems to be the likely culprit.  They were in the hospital on Sunday and all seemed OK.  They went back Sunday night and he was gone.  She gave birth to Aiden Curick Mayo on Monday morning.  He was about 2.5 lbs, about 13 inches long.  He had Mark's mouth and Amber's dark hair.   Curick (sp?) is for both his grandfathers' middle names - Curtis and Frederick.    I was there on Monday afternoon and got to hold him.  He was bundled up in blankets and wore a knitted blue cap.  At first it was difficult to touch his downy little face - my fingers just wouldn't go down all the way - but Mark unbundled him to show me his long fingers and encouraged me silently...  The hardest part, for the interlopers at least, is verbalizing.  What to say, what not to say.  How much to give without getting in the way.  Immediate plans, insipid details, emotional platitudes...it seems impossibly and simultaneously both vital and futile.  Though I am still uncertain as to what role the Lord has in my own life, I'm thankful that He is in my childrens' life.  It is such a fragile existence....I am eternally grateful that my two are healthy and intelligent - and more spiritual than I.
