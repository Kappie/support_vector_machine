    
       So here's an update on my current situation in regards to photography, photoshop, and DeviantART. I'm still in summer school so my time's very limited (especially seeing as I've made a pledge to myself to study several hours a day). Therefore DeviantART, Warriors Realm, and Photoshop are out-of-bounds for most of the week. On the plus side I am learning to use photoshop, I will bring my camera to my school downtown (in the slums) where there are plenty of opportunities for interesting shots, and I went downtown yesterday and made an interesting picture. The downside is, however, that I just started my new roll of film so the photos probably won't be on DA until next weekend. Oh yeah, and Picture CDs are a great invention...
