I've realised that the holidays have given me a great big confidence boost.  Maybe it's the absence of dick-heads from school, or the fact I'm starting to go out more.  I'm lovin' it!  Me and James left Craig's and went to James' house and I managed to get his Eye-Toy working as a webcam.  It's a cool looking thing!  I'm gonna force myself to wake up early tomorrow so I can try and get back into a normal sleeping pattern.  Hopefully it shall work!
