Even though that can be hard, I know that its what God wants me to do, and I'm willing to do that, but I have another question.  Once you have forgiven a person, do you still have to let them into your life again. to do the same things to you? If they have lied to you, are you supposed to trust them again? If they have hurt or betrayed you, do you let them into a position where they can do it again?  I wonder about this, because I wonder if when I don't, does it meant that I have not truly forgiven that person? Or does God understand the way I am feeling, and does He allow me to forgive, but not set myself up for a beating again?  The reason that I wonder about this issue, is that when my marriage broke up, I was obviously feeling very hurt. It took me a wee while, but I was able to forgive my wife for some of the things that happened. Now though, she says that she wants us to be friends. My feeling towards this is that I can't be friends with someone I can no longer respect, or trust, and that because of that I don't want to have anything to do with her. Does that meant that I haven't forgiven her, or do I have the right to try to protect myself from future hurt?  Love to know what you guys think on that one.
