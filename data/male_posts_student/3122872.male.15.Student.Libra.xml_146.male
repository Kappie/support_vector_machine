Did great in Morrowind, till i lost around 2 hours of gaming when the bloody game crashed to desktop for no reason. As reliable as a pile of dog crap, I tell you. Wheres the fun.  Simon's off to South Africa soon. To some nice 6* hotel i presume. I'll just have to do with my 1/4* bedroom :\ Fun, fun, fun. Well, look on the bright side. I've got an great window to look out, and then I will see something Simon won't see in S.Africa! Rain! Hahaha! :/  Anyway, wasted half a day and created  urlLink this . Yes, my dev log/blog. James will take a rager at me, but at least I won't die?! Will i??! Uhoh... Kinda expecting a knife across the ocean being thrown at me...arghhh   tribute to thy l33tn3ss Dragontail
