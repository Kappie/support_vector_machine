I haven't played video games in a  looooong  time, but this is definately worth my time...I think.  Anyways, check it out at  urlLink Rockstar Games .  The Manhunt site drove me nuts, but I finished it!  On a completely unrelated note, I found this Personality Disorder test and it seems to be decent, although I'm basing that on the fact that there are no "did you ever poop your pants when you were little" type questions.   urlLink Here's the test  if you wanna take it, and here are my results...I don't suggest believing these results at all, I mean, what are shrinks for if this 'amazing' test could tell me what I am.       Disorder      Rating        urlLink Paranoid :    High       urlLink Schizoid :    Low       urlLink Schizotypal :    Moderate       urlLink Antisocial :    High       urlLink Borderline :    Low       urlLink Histrionic :    Very High       urlLink Narcissistic :    High       urlLink Avoidant :    High       urlLink Dependent :    Moderate       urlLink Obsessive-Compulsive :    High
