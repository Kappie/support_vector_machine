I can praise them, make fun of them, whatever.  But its all in good fun, so if I make fun of your blog, then I don't really mean it.  Anyway, let's get to it.  After I'm done presenting these 4 blogs (yes, 4, since I fell asleep before I could post last night), I'm going to talk about fireworks, and what happened.   Uninterest: The Most Boring Place on the Web  Link:  urlLink Uninterest   Uh oh...looks like someone is trying to compete against me for the most boring place on the whole wide interweb.  Now, I know I don't have the most boring blog (its actually really interesting, every time I go back and read what I've said), but, I try to think that it is.  So, properly, I'm going to make fun of this one.  His posts are short, incredibly boring, and his design is really girly.  He uses the dots dark template, which is available here directly on teh Bl0gg3r.  He's had his blog for not even a week.  His posts range from "Wow, I saw fireworks at the lake," to "I played Warcraft 3 today."  Guess what?!  This blog is officially the most boring blog it has even been my pleasure to stumble across!  Congrats, you receive the Blog of Bagel Boring Blog award for tonight!  Be sure to post that on your blog somewhere.   Big in Tokyo  Link:  urlLink Click it.   This girl I guess recently moved to Tokyo, and talks about her life there.  Her most recent post is called "Cockroaches and Tomatoes," and she starts off by saying that she rode her bike for the first time in Tokyo.  She uses big vocabulary words that would take me a century to understand (sarcastically, of course), and she seems like she's a person of the older, maybe 20-25 years old.  This blog is pretty boring, but, hey, if you wrote a post about how you rode your bike through Tokyo for the first time, what would you want me to call it?   I hate Blog  Link:  urlLink Click it.   This, by far, has to be the stupidest blog I have ever stumbled across in the whole world.  If the post isn't in English, it's Japanese, and when it's English, all it contains is a quote from someone.  He's got a picture of what looks like Tokyo in it, and all over the blog, signs of "I hate Blog" can be seen.  Who can hate teh bl0gg3r?!  It's the most addicting thing I've ever done in my life!  Congratulations, you have won the award for "Worst blog looked at...ever!"   Glutton's Photo-a-Day  Link:  urlLink Click here for the Glutton.   This has got to be the best blog that I have looked at for this nightly feature thus far...though, I'm not agreeing with the name.  Could this person be a glutton?!  Anyway, this is a photo-blog, and whoever took these pictures (didn't bother reading the profile), has some incredible photography skills.  There are some pictures (not all, but some) that are really, really good, and this is a blog to definitely check out.  The person behind this blog wins the Best Blog award for tonight.  Congratulations, young glutton photo taker.  You have proven to be one of the best blogs that I've seen on the entire interweb.  And that's it for Late Night Bloggin'.  Now on to tonight's regularly scheduled post, Holy Fireworks! -----------------------  So, my dad and brother decide to go and buy fireworks and let them off the dock tonight.  So they did, and they came back with this set of missile like things.  Well, little did we know that they were going to scatter all over the yard, sending flames and stuff hurling towards the house.  No fire (which is good, because if you ever saw my house, you'd hope it never caught on fire), but, it was dangerous, and leaves me with one quick paraphrase of a popular cartoon quote:  "Fireworks night is a very dangerous night."  That had to be the highlight of the night.  Tomorrow, bagel.tech starts anew with Blogger and Photoshop week.  That's right, you're getting 2 tips a day, one for Photoshop and one for Blogger.  I'm going to help Blogger users make their blogs look even better.    That's it for Blog of Bagel tonight.  Time for me to fall asleep.  I've done a lot of interweb posting today, and now I'm taking a break.  So, until tomorrow, remember that fireworks are dangerous, and so is posting your blog on the Blogger directory, because I might be coming to YOURS next.
