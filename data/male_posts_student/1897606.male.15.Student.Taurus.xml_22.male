It was pretty weird seeing about 400 fans all in the same place. There were even a few people from Oak Park.   So we got inside and found a seat. We were one of the first people to go into the actual church, so we were able to get some pretty good seats. The 45-minute wait didn't last too long, we just listened to the pointless conversations of jaded pseudo-intellectual college kids.  Finally at about 7:15, the Rainy Day Books lady came out and said we had to wait for the stragglers, and it would be another 15 minutes, but Chuck was here. Applause. Ah well, I'd made it this long.   25 minutes later...enter Rainy Day Books lady. Pretty much just a shameless plug ("Come check out Al Franken!" Suck it!).  Finally , Chuck emerged from backstage, to a standing ovation. It wasn't as shocking as I had expected it to be, he pretty much seemed like a regular guy. He gave a little introduction/sound check, then got to his short story work-in-progress, "Guts." Definitely an "interesting" story...it's essentially 6 pages of repulsive but hilarious masturbation stories. Seriously. So repulsive, they were rejected from PLAYBOY. To give a sample, a boy got a carrot stuck in his anus, another a stick of wax melted inside his urethra, another is disemboweled by a swimming pool drain. Yummy. It's not surprising there have been people passing out as a result of this story.  After he was finished, he had a Q session. He gave out prizes to the people that asked questions, mostly goofy hats and hand made rosaries. There were some pretty interesting questions, a few idiotic ones (one girl insisted on giving him a noogie), but Chuck gave a complete, usually funny, answer to all the questions he was asked. You got the feeling he had been asked them all before. After about 30-45 minutes of questions, he had to cut it off (there were still plenty of hands up), and start the signing. Unfortunately, I had ticket 237...meaning I had to wait about 2 hours to get my books signed. But it wasn't too bad, I just hung out and talked to a few fellow geeks, and before I knew it I was up on stage. I went up, shook his hand, and asked him a question about Diary (I don't want to spoil the book), and we had a brief conversation about it. He signed Diary and stamped it on a few pages with "PLEASE RETURN TO WAYTANSEA PUBLIC LIBRARY." Haha, what a jerk. Then he signed my copy of Fight Club and stamped it with "PROPERTY OF SHADY MOUNTAIN MENTAL HOSPITAL."   Anyway, it was a really great time. If you haven't checked out any of his work, do so! And maybe next time he's in town I'll catch you at the reading.
