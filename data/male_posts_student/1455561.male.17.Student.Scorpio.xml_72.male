Then you realise what a completely weird day you've just had and how odd your life is going to get for the time being.  yesterday: rationally.  1) Go to portsmouth rather early in the morning. 2) Spend 6 hours with people who have only travelled about 30 mins to be there, making you feel like the 2 hour trip might have been a bit excessive. 3) learn how to push people in wheel chairs up and down stairs (the key is not tipping them out) 4) discover i am going to spend a week in france with the people i met yesterday. (fortunately they are all pretty cool.  some are even from the isle of white, and i have no idea why that fact interests me so much) 5) sit clueless through a religious ceremony. 6) go to a little chef 7) go home.  i could explain the one thing that makes all of the above make some sort of sense, but im not saying anything for now.  see, i'm not the only one round here who can have secrets.  As for the rest of my summer, it seems it will be spent walking around tewkesbury buying very large quantities of fruit and then writing about them  Again, i could explain, but i choose not to.  For now.  There is also a part of me, that has decided, against the will of the rest of me, to learn every bone in the human body.  I have no idea why.  I am somehow rationalising it to myself with the following idea:  there are 206 bones.  Whatever is on the left is on the right. 103 bones to remember. 26 vertebrae, which i hope will all have similar names, or numbers.  77 bones to remember. 24 ribs, which i hope also have numbers. 65 bones to remember.  how hard can it be?  i am actually showing restraint with this idea: at first it was all the bones and all the muscles.  Then i saw a diagram, which cut away into many smaller diagrams of many, many muscles, working other muscles, working smaller muscles.  This summer is going to be...... something
