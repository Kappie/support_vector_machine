SOOOOOOOO i didnt see it today...im not much of a "go tot he movies by yourself" type of person, its just not as fun, cuz you cant make fun of the people in the movies by yourself. well, you can, but its not as funny. oh well...maybe next time? hopefully. theres a lot of people on my block who are the same age as me...i wanna meet some of them, but im not good at "first time meeting thingies" it would be easier if i had someone else to go up to them with me or if i was really hyper. ive been wanting to meet temecula people since i moved out here, but im not good at that stuff...oh well, atleast i have friends as it is. im talking to kyle M. (not P.) hes a funny/cool guy. man im bored...ive been checking the computer on and off all day to see if Caitlin was on, but she hasnt been on =( neither has ashten, but i just found out that shes babysitting until 8 sooooooo im stuck here with kyle...jk hes cool. ya well im gonna get going ok? GOOD! bye
