Friday before I left, I wanted to part with Kaya, and I gave her the impression that I was angry at her, which I really did not mean to do. So I drove all day to Marin...and had dinner (the chicken was a tad hard...) and then called Kaya. We talked and it was nice. On Saturday, my Broheim came over and it was a really really nice time. I really look up to him, and the usual shebang. After the shebang comes.....  The PART-AY  and thus Shimone (SHE-MOAN) drove me to Seth's house (Thanks for the ride sheem) where I found Seth and his friends having jello mixed with vodka...tasted like Robitussin...(sorry if I misspelled it) It was insane. Basically. -People got waaay too drunk. -Seth's friend got really sick and threw up -Seth got a blowjob -I really missed Kaya -Girls giving me the "eye"  and then sleep yadda yadda.  Sunday: THE BBQ!!!!!!!!! I am so proud to be on staff!!! It is really a dream come true. I hope Kaya can come someday. I'd love to share the family tradition with someone as important as her. I got a free shirt :)  Nobody knew me...except for everyone knew me.  And that ends the weekend.
