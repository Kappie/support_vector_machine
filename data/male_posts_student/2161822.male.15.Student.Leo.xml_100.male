For all you slow folk out there, that means an original every practice. That's productive. Usually it takes me hours or even days to think of a good riff to play, but when we practice everything falls into place perfectly. It's also interesting since the originals done are more of a blend of genres than just one. So basically what I'm saying is we rule.   So here's to another long weekend. Tomorrow I'm going to Knobles, which is better than staying in Hazleton, but then again, anything is better than Hazleton. Last week was the last  full  week of school. Ah, just saying that makes me feel good. Yesterday we got our Chem tests back and everyone did outstanding. Anywhere from 50's to 80's for everyone. Until we started going over it and he realized he put questions on the test he said we didn't have to learn. So basically everyone's grade went up. But I'm still not too pleased. I just don't like that class too much. Shoot me. I think there's a general majority that feels the same way. But who cares, school is over. Addicted to the Used and Thursday. \m/ °_° \m/   Listen to H.I.M.
