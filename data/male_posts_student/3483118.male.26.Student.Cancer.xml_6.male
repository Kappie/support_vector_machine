I think the latter applies to me and my stupid, platitude-laden prediction on the NBA Finals.  The Pistons, whom I considered little more than a speed bump for the Laker Express, played aggresively, selflessly and cohesively throughout the series, and 5 as one will beat a pair of giants every time.  Watching them was so reassuring; every time I let out a little shout of joy or admiration last night I was really saying "see Dad, basketball has    not   gone to hell in a handbasket after all."  Anyway, here's to the underdogs who got it done the right way: your 2004 NBA Champion Detroit Pistons.  Also known as the Michigan chapter of the Washington Wizards Alumni Association.
