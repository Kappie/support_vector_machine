I crawled out of my bed to eat lunch in dining hall after refusing to get up and hid under the quilt for the entire morning, hmm not entire morning.   well, i slept at 6 am the night(morning) because tong has serious problem with his relationship with Sulyn. Sulyn apparently suggested a temporary separation regarding their relationship, citing reasons to have some time to think about whether or not to continue with it (in my own interpretation). Well tong was very down, so we spent time listening to him and talking to him.   woke up 2.5 hrs later, needed to send our car (me and teong) to the mechanic (BEn) servicing. came back at ard 10 30 am and called bel to make sure that she is away from her bed, sitting on her chair doing her essay. Ended up chatting with her till 11 plus, due to her reluctance to pry herself away frm the beloved bed. She said, the bed now is her refuge from the amount of assignments that she has to do. she is stressed to the level that doing no work seems like a breeze, a temporary reprieve despite the nightmarish thought of looming deadlines and blatant time-wasting that accompanies it. And she also has weird dreams about dating a guy that she used to have a crush on in JC. Then we started talking about the past again. the sharing of the past no matter how dark and awful seems to bridge our distance. Well i decided to sleep after the fone conversation  I think i have veered out of topic, the realisation hit me when i recalled my topic header. Yes Kelong referee! I played the final of the UWA 5 aside soccer with INDOSS team. The game started well with us trying to neutralise their relentless attacks. The half time score stood at 1-1. It was quite a tightly contested soccer match.  The second half started. Here comes the part where i think is one of the worst refereeing that i have ever experienced in my whole life. They were attacking. Boon intercepted a pass, the ball bounced off his shin and Mark our goalie decided to catch it.The opponents started to appeal for backpass. Up to this point it was a normal circumstance that u would encounter in a soccer match.   Ok now lets start with the key events leading up the the refereeing farce.... After the incident above everyone looked at the referee for decision. How he reacted to this was incomprehensible. He had two choices: To award indirect free kick, or to signal play on! or just simply stay cool and dont move. For this referee.  He started walking into the pitch slowly (the referee always stayed by the sideline in this small scale soccer match). He started mumbling, Mark then let go of the ball from his grip as everyone has stopped the play to wait for the indirect free kick we have expected to be awarded to the opponent(though it was not so fair, but well..). So the ball is now on the ground, with the referee strolling and mumbling, who knows what, into the pitch. Out of everyone's expectation, He just woke up from his "marijuanaish effect" and said: " Hey! play on! continue!.... The opponent just gratefully discovered that the ball is just under his very nose, and tapped it into the goal with our goalie still trying to figure out why the ball is kicked at the goal( Our players were equally open-mouthed). 2-1 to them , the suffocating feeling of injustice filled our eager but overworked lungs, the air was harder to breathe in as the stench of unfairness and unsportingness have polluted the very air, relentless arguments were useless, the goal stood. Simply kelong, no other word, you can imagine the avid S-leaguers chanting: " Referee Kayu, Referee kayu!" Or the more familiar Mat's referee abuse:" sial lah! referee kelong man! kayu sia! The match ended with us losing 3-2, and to think that it was the final...(*a deep breath...and a long sigh).
