This has nothing to do with your post... but YOU of all people should know how I feel about Josh. YOU know I would never do anything to hurt him like go out with Daniel, or anyone, behind his back.. Someone said YOU told him that me and Daniel were going out. That is the most ridiculous thing that has ever come out of anyone's mouth. YOU should know how much I love Josh, I would never do that to him. And if you knew me at all, YOU would know I would never do that to anyone, especially Josh. I don't know what motivates you to constantly ruin people's relationships, and I don't want to know. I just know that I don't want to talk to you for LONG time. And yes everyone does think you're weird, not because of what I had on my blog but bc you hurt people intentionally. I don't know what's happened to you. You've changed.   First off, I didn't say anything that has anything to do with Daniel and Cassy. I talked to Daniel before any of this happened, and he knows I don't care one way or the other and am remaining neutral. Also, since when do I try to ruin other peoples relationships. For the past month, Cassy has blaimed multiple people for trying to break her and Josh up, and every time he does so much as talks to a girl, she freaks out. I'm so mad that I'm getting blamed for something I'm not even involved in, and have so much more to say about this, but for now I have to go. I'll post more later.
