Weight training was pretty long but the last few weeks Tyke has been actually wanting to work out so he worked out today pretty well and he is noticing results too.  Exercise sure does release some nice endorphins or whatever the hell is chemically released through the body.  Tyke always feels nice after working out hard.  But then English was stupid.  Tyke went in there and took the little Hammy test and breezed through it although he is thinking he'll get a 39/60.  Or at least that is his guess.  After the test he wrote his little essay and it was all crap he just made up.  But he used his strong vocabulary to make it sound good.  Then he and Amed went out to lunch at JIB by themselves since stupid Dr. Phil has no 6th period so he just left and didn't even go with them to lunch.  That was gay.  But lunch was still fun nonetheless.  WASL days do need to have a longer lunch though.  35 minutes seems way shorter on WASL days than it does on regular days.  After lunch was Physics which is kinda gay sometimes now.  Like when Tyke found out he went Fishing.  That sorta sucked.  That made him go from playing Baseball to Curling.  Not exactly what he was looking for.  Now his GPA is like 2.45 or something.  But he isn't failing English anymore and that is definitely a positive.  He should be able to bring up at least 2 of his classes.  So today wasn't that fun but tomorrow should be fine.  He has a test in one class but other than that, posh.  Posh wasn't exactly the word Tyke was looking for but he used it nonetheless cuz Tyke is the Creator of this blog.  From now on Tyke will capitalize the 'H' in He when referring to Tyke.  Or at least until Tyke gets tired of doing so.  Tyke is excited for Thursday because then He gets to wear shorts most likely and that is always fun.  Shorts days at school are like the best days at school.  So it is time for Him to sign off.  And Raul Ibanez is a stud.  Tyke has always liked Raul believe it or not.  Even back in the early days of his Mariner/Rainiers career.  Same with Scott Podsednik.  And of course Charles Gipson.  But how could Tyke forget about Arquimedez Pozo?  Ok, now Tyke is gonna focus on looking at the All-Time Tacoma Rainiers roster cuz that is very entertaining for Tyke.
