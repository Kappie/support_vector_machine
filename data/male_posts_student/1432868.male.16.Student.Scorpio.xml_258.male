As I flipped I noticed the almost obligitory pass of the New York skyline and I realized very quickly that they all weren't quite right. All of them had been manipulated so that in some way the world trade center buildings were taken out. I wonder why they do this. It's been nearly 3 years since the buildings were destroyed. Why don't we let the buildings stand in the films. It represents how NY was during that time. Why must we be like Stalin and erase people in photos who don't exist anymore. I know it may still hurt some people to see those buildings as a reminder of what happened, but burying their image in history is not the solution either. We all know what happened so why must we deny it by trying to erase it from these movies. Besides they do a horrid job at it. The world trades center buildings weren't much to look at in the first place and after manipulation it can look pretty bad. that's just something that annoys me  [music-Bump of chicken Sailing day] (even though I don't know wtf they are saying.
