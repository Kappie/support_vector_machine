But I got caught up doing a little extra credit so now I'm in forensic science, we have a sub and I am done with all my work so I turn to mi blogo for a little relief from the boredom that plagues me.   At the risk of sounding like a complete drum corps nerd...I LOVE THE BLUE DEVILS "B" CORPS!!!, there that felt good. Yesterday was perhaps one of the funnest days Ive had by far this year. Did a little marching, a little playing, nothing completly out of the ordinary, but for some reason it was more fun then anything I have done previous to that. We got to play with the drums which was perhaps the highlight of the whole rehearsal simply because I was on the other side of the arc. I still couldn't help thinking to myself that I was good enough to make the drumline...but as for now I am very content being a horn player.   Well today hasnt really unraveled yet so there is nothing really to say...I hate driving in the rain and it is pouring outside, I can't wait to get home today, and do a little practicn' but I hate the fact that I have a college class tonight...But what more can I do? Absolutly nothing. Well until tonight or until I have something interesting to write about Payce....
