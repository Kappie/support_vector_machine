She is absolutely crazy... but in a good way. I have World History and English with her... Almost my first class, and my last class... great way to begin and end a day...  If you ever see Angela frown, no scratch that, if you ever see her not smiling, take a picture it will be a one of a kind rarity...  And you know something else??? Angela my seem to be a "dumb blonde and in lack of common sence (which I guess she is at time), but she has asked me some of the most insightfull and interesting questions I've ever heard... Stuff that makes you think more than anything else... Its really pretty great.  As I said about Robin, If you don't know Angla (oops spelled it like she did...on her wall in paint) Angela* then you really should get to know her... You won't be sorry.  -Dan V
