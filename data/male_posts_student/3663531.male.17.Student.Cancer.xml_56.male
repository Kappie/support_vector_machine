Any real"computer user" (I use the term  real  about as ambiguously as the word hacker) can spell without taking a massive amount of time to do so.  Top5 annoying examples:  1.  Wif.  Oh my god, that  ONE EXTRA LETTER  you didn't type must have saved you ages.  2.  WTF?  What is wrong with just typing "what the fuck?" it isn't that hard, and it has more impact. Test it-say toyour boss/teacher/warden "W-T-F?", gauge their reaction, then say "What the FUCK?" and compare.  3.  OMG.  I'm pretty sure this exists because most people who go in chat rooms aren't sure about whether to type "o" or "oh", and the spelling of the word "my".  4. Dun.  I don't even know what this means. You would think it was short for "Done" but if it is, the context in which it often appears proves that the people who write it are stupider than I thought. Which is bloody stupid.  5.  Boi/gurl.  I dont understand the motivation, other than to spell something differently than someone with a  positive  IQ would. The same amount of letters is used, and the keys are   at most 6 mm closer   on the keyboard. Given the way these people type, I don' think it makes a difference anyway.    Well, I'm done with that.  Until it annoys me again.
