There was a block party and my family came over for my birthday, god it was amazing. I hung out with Kate, Britt and Dan the whole time. We went to the block party and made fools of ourselves, or maybe I just did. We went in the moon bounce maze thingy. We beat the crap out of all the kids and Dan Conklin and Gavin got in trouble and kicked out for wrestling in the bounce. The lady said they could of broke the children. Thank you, and they are humans, not machines, or toys for that matter. Anyways, lemme just sum up what happened at the block party, I joined in all the activities and made my cousins laugh by making fun of any wankstas. I made fun of Chris across the street from me who's a wanksta and he said you have no penis. He's going into 8th and he said that. I laughed in his face and slapped up his bitch fo shizzle. My coucins kept laughing at everything I did...it wasn't that funny. Then this bitch yelled at me for joining in the game so I blew the whistle in her ear. Tehe. Ya I blew my cousin's lifeguard whistle a million times. Then I helped out scavenger hunt with the little boys, Lindsay Olsen, Dan Olsen, Nick Conklin and some other girl. Ya, but we didn't win and I had to keep running back and forth. But back at my house, things were really funny...here are some lines.  "Woof Gonzo" and "Cactapuss" - Dan  I'm talking to my sister about blocking the sides of the road with cones and I say "But we don't have cones, that's the problem" and my sister replies with "Well we got ice cream cones?"  "Grandma, if you were to be a superhero, who would you be?" - My Dad under the influence of us kids "Sausage" - Grandma thinking my dad ment a hero you can eat Us dying laughing, I go inside and ask her the real question again... "No but seriously Grandma who would you be?" - Me "Emilia Eirheart" - Grandma    (the first women to fly across the world i think)  Ya it was really funny, we were going to rent Ringu (Japanese version of The Ring, I think Ringu was the original) but we couldn't because adults suck. Ok cya everybody and happy birthday to me!
