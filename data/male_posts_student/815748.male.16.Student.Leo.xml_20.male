Right now, I only have two things to say:  1) In English today, Ms. Craig-Olins was tALking about what happened during the fALl of Troy. One of the things she said was, and I quote, "Those who did not die were killed." :)  2) In math, I wondered, how do you know on those cops shows (like Law and Order) that when they say, "We caught the perp, chief," that they're tALking about the perpetrator of the crime, and not a perpendicular bisector? This led (with Richie's help) to the conception of a detective movie in which they catch the "perp", charging him with knowingly and willingly bisecting the opposite line at a 90 degree angle. At trial, he would argue that the evidence of this was inadmissable, for they measured his angles without a search warrant and without probable cause for believing he was harboring 2 equal sides, making him, under law, an isoceles triangle (which is punishable by 10 years in a maximum security Cartesian graph, forced to spend his days making congruent, equilaterAL license plates).
