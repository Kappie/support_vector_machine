When I was 16, I was so happy cause I was going to JC soon.......when I was 18, kind of dreadful cause army soon.........when I was 21, it was the age of maturity n finally I could get the credit cards n make decisions and enter pubs......now suddenly......24...I have accomplished nothing........  Yest moi darlyng made alot of effort to make my birthday a memorable one......thou we had some pricky moments, generally I enjoyed myself alot. Hmmphm I still didnt get everything I want on my birthday.........in anycase *applause* for my darlyng for her effort.....hip hip hooray!!!  Oh jsut submitted an online applciation for Maybank debitcard. Guess it would be useful for me to use when I go to malaysia. Kk need to prepare, going out with my darling later on.        Quote for the day: One should never find too many cards a problem.
