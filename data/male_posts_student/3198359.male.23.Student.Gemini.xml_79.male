The result is both disturbing and hilarious.       My take on the issue? The guy is as thick as two short planks and twice as ugly. Half-baked assertions wrapped up in an enigma with a drisel of bullshit over the top. Typical of the religious right; when in doubt, make stuff up. If you can't make up something quick enough, simply yell and scream random bible verses until the person(s) leave.
