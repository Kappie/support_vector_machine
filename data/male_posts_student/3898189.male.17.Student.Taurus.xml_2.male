But thats ok, and for those who actually care enough to visit, I am sorry that I have not been posting, things around here have been a little bit crazy for me right now, and it is a little hard to explain... Anyway! Sunday (and/or Monday) I talked to Rhae and that is allways enjoyable cause she has a really pretty voice. But I had to go clean and it is a little hard for me to clean, talk to her, and listen to my sister bitch. So I told her that I would call back between 7-7:30.  So I passed out on the couch and then woke up a little before 7. So I called her. I was informed that she was not home and was asked if I would like to leave a message. I told her to tell Rhae that I called and to call me back whenever she got home or as soon as she can. I am also in a bit of a hard space cause I really want to see her but cant. (I also feel she may be mad at me for something) could be not calling her more, which is my fault, but it is also really hard to get to the phone sometimes. I have also not been allowed on the computer as much so...Yeah. (I NEED MY OWN COMPUTER!)  I also have not been to the Doctor in about a month, and I really need to go. I have also realized that I have been going to see him for twice a month every month for a year strieght. ( I dunno if that is good or bad)  Also people have a strange way of showing emotion and to piss me off all in one swift move. Like when I ask for a ride somewhere I get bitched at so I feel bad for going off, my sister has also picked up this trait. So I do not like asking to go anywhere anymore because I do not want to get bitched at. (But that is inevitable) I also do not have a licence (NOT MY FAULT!) for that fact I do not even have a learners.... ANYWAY!  I also spoke to Tonio a couple of nights ago...That is always fun cause he knows exactly where I have been and I know the same...I think... I just hope he dose not do anything drastic cause alot of people will be VERY SAD! ( dont ask why I capitolized it all)  What else has been going on. I have also been feeling a bit sick lately. I am not sure why, I do not have anything to be guilty of, and I have not been sleeping properly. I wake up like three times a night again. I haven't woken up that much since school because I was so streesed out. ( and I dont think I am streesed...)  I also talked to Tiffany the other night...(Monday night concerning that was my last post.) That was a very interesting conversation. She really knows her vedio game stuff...She also said I am #2 on things she is most scared of ^_^  Well that is all I have to complain about for now... I feel depresed.
