I feel like I am in highschool, hopping from job to job in the same mall. I am really excited, mostly to be leaving Zales.  Tomorrow, out shifts change at the bird rescue center and I will be doing the 7:30-12 shift mostly. I get to try that out for the first time tomorrow.  What else is going on? Well, I watched a movie last night after MiMi and I went to the grocery store. The check out guy, Joshua K., was a weirdo. Always staring at MiMi and saying outloud the products like, "vegetable broth, oranges, etc." I wanted to say, "Yeah dude, that is right, you are good at identification." FUCK. haha. So I watched the Ninth Gate with Jonny Depp and the ending sucked. That is all.   current mood:  determined current music: Califone - Don't Let Me Die Nervous
