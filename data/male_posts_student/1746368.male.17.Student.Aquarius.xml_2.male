    
       Well, I am starting to work on my new about me website. I am calling it  urlLink Mind Set . Eventually I will have a link up on the left. Most likely once I feel like it. Right now I am looking for a place where I can download classical music midis and put on my website.   When I am done with at least the music page, I will put it up for you guys. I will also put up a friends page. If you want to be on it, you only need two things. To be my friend, and have a life. Well, that should narrow it down to a few people. Talk to you all later. Goodbye.
