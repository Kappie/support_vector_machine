Ok, I'm neglecting to say that Hans sounds like Pacino + the talking goat enough.  He Does.  And he heard the talking goat, and busted up.  My God.  We rehearsed the wedding with all the important guys (groomsmen, me being one of them) and then went out to eat.  I met Ryan's brother, Eric (very similar in appearance) and his English uncle.  Good ole chap.  Derek went to a seminar that night with Sei Tai Gung (anthony dandridge) smoking and fighting and whatnot.  Yestermorn, as I am want to call it, it rained, just as my dad predicted.  Eh.  We still got in our tuxes, went to the gazebo on the green, and had Sonja's ceremony as planned.  I have pictures!  Anyway. Reception rocked, kung fu people came.  Wine flowed free.  The band played Sabbath at my request (sweet leaf! yesss) and one of my dad's old friends got high and started talking about how his computer runs off of gerbil power and how it costs a damned fortune to feed those bastards.... or somesuch stoned jabber.  Yep.  Sonja and Ryan have tons of presents.  I played some Virtua Fighter 4, as the shaolin monk.  Awesome.  I drove all 4 hours back to town in the van.  Woot.  Oh, yeah, Hans had more sex, too.  And he's old.  Hahahaha, horny Dutchman.  Anyway.  Ask me in person, I'll tell you more.
