( and it breaks down for a second time when i hit the publish post button... !!! damn... )  #$^@^%@^% !!!  lemme remember all the words i've written just a moment ago... (and a moment ago...)  ...  oh... my connection broke down for almost 2 hrs because of singtel maintanance i think... and now it's up and running...  and i am also going through the discs which come with the book and it cost us $36 (Essentials of Marketing)...  plus i wonder how slow the people at CPF working can be... the cpf approved education scheme tat i sent in 2 months ago and it's still 'pending'...  hmm i think i'll still be back a little bit later...
