Well, they didn't 'still' find it hilarious, because it was only their first time seeing it, but they thought it was damn funny.   I fixed my hair situation. My hair situation didn't really last long and it wasn't that big of a deal, but now it is over. I was just getting really tired of doing the same thing every day; with the thing up in the front. I thought it was cool and that it looked okay on me, but the repetition was just making me a bit annoyed. So I just put it up differently, and I think it looks as okay as the old style. It's more spiky. John still has the camera, so no pictures are available at this time.   I need to get started on my homework. A CIM science inquiry is due on Tuesday for ecology. I know that sounds bad, but it really isn't. Gilford gave the class all the data we need, so all I need to do is write it up. Plus, this stuff is easy.   Bad news friends, I'm afraid that the Weird Al concert is not possible for me to attend. My family will be spending our week-long, family reunion/camping trip up at Baker Lake in Washington. I'm going to have to miss one of my drawing classes too. The one on the 31st. Complete bullshit. And  Garden State  comes out on July 31st. Damn, damn, damn. I  have to  see that movie. I've viewed the preview many, many times and it still gives me chills.   I like how comments are open to anyone, instead of Xanga's Nazi-like commenting regime. And now I can get comments from anonymous people. So now if anyone wants to threaten or make fun of me, you're welcome to go right ahead, because I won't be able to figure out who you are.   I wear a watch now. Times change, get used to it.   "Six Feet Under," is on now. Bye now.
