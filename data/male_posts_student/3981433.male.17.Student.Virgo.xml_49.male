Kill Bill is the worst film i've seen in ages - it lacks a real moral plot and storyline - its killing for killing's sake. and to be honest i have no idea why anyone would wanna watch it...  Walking Tall was better. The Rock plays the guy really well - u can sense the character. anyway thats well worth seeing.  went to the park afterwards with Marco - was kinda boring to start with - that cool player guy, Simon, was there so it was all good. simons ball got stuck in a tree...  anyway we all moved to the Priory Garden santury place and all just chatted...i met Mica, Jenny, Emily and Sophia. we played with some mascara - just painting everyones hair, Simon's chin, and Rumbos pubes...well thats was all fun - Mica was throwin herself all over me - i think she might just be a flirt - not all that sure - not that i care...just some good clean fun.  Marco went to italy today (2am) told him to bring me back some decent photos of some hot women...  another thing that didnt bug me so much as...puzzle me was Becca. before she went away she was all cute and flirty - now shes all quiet and untalkitve - i wonder if i read too far into what she was sayin - knowin me i probably did....  Back to today - i'm aiming to go to the travel agents with dad - see if we can get some cheap cruise tickets for the med for me and friend. I think i'll take charli - shes a nice lass and we get on pretty well...all the guy frinds have gone on holiday now anyway...i'm not sure if i should take her of gemma tho - however i dont think gemma could get the money together...believe i asked her a week or so ago.  I'd love to take gemma cos shes in need of a nice break, and well i dont really know charli all that well anyway...but i'll take whoever - i'm sure it'll be fun.  mmm wonder what film to watch today...
