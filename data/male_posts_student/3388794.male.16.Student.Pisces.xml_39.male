I discussed travelling back to bradford with the mother. it will cost me Â£12 for a return ticket, making t damn easy for me to travel here. Love doesnt have boundaries i figure, just hurdles. jumping over them is the test, and i think i will pass, i know i will pass.   the sky is a landscape of its own this evening, and i feel lost in it. it lights up the leaves on the trees, making them golden, more amazing then i have seen them before. days like these make me glad to be alive.
