Lover's Concerto     * How gentle is the rain, that falls softly  on the meadow. Birds high up on the trees,  serenade the clouds with their melodies.*   Repeat *   Oh... See there beyond the hills,  the bright colors of the rainbow.  Some magic from above.  Made this day for us, just to fall in love.  You'll hold me in your arms,  and say once again you'll love me.  And that your love is true,  everything will be just as wonderful.   Now, I belong to you,  from this day until forever.  Just love me tenderly and I'll give to you  every part of me.  Oh! Don't ever make me cry,  through long lonely nights without us.  Be always true to me, keep this day  in your heart eternally.  You'll hold me in your arms, and say  once again you love me.  And that your love is true,  everything will be just as wonderful.
