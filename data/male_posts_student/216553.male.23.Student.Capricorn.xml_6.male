I actually felt that I had left Nevis for back home or even the United States!  Everything was clean, and there were quite a few people from England, Australia and North America.  It was funny though, some people were giving us strange looks probably wondering what all these "kids" are doing at such a fancy resort.  After lunch, we visited the gift shop and they had some very fancy gifts there for quite reasonable prices and I know what I'm getting you folks when I get back in Toronto in August. :)  I'm sitting down right now trying to work on my stupid chemistry assignment.  It's pretty damn boring and rather useless.  Anatomy is getting quite rough, and honestly, I hate histology and neurobiology.  Ok, here's the mnemonic for the day,  Multipolar cells: Are called multipolar due to multiple dendritic branches.  Four types of multipolar neurons: PIMP - Purkinjee cells, Interneurons, Motor neurons, and Pyrimidal cells.    That's all!
