I have gotten drunk and made an ass out of myself.  I have studied.  I have worked.  That is the recap of the month now on to more current things...  Ok we will start with Thursday night.. Thursday night was one for the record books..  I first went to go see  urlLink Ryan Cabrera  play his guitar at the granada because our fraternity put it on.  I have to say it was one of the gayest things I have ever seen in my life and if I could erase it from my memory I would.  I mean imagine a little metrosexual dude from Texas up playing all this cheesy John Mayer type shit..  Yeah it wasn't good.    Well I proceed to get hammered and yell at this dude to play Willie Nelson all night.  He tells me he doesn't know any Willie, So of course I question his manhood because hell he's from Texas and plays guitar and knows no Willie..  He's gotta be gay..  So I end up going and getting completely wasted and playing pool against some people that I don't really remember but I played awful..    So the concert ended at like 10:30 so we go to 815 where one of my buddies is having his birthday..  I proceed to get even more drunk playing Blackjack for fake money and getting a Key Chain and drinking some Rapper drinks (Hypnotic) but of course I was hammered so those 40 proof rapstar drinks aren't good enough for me so I get it mixed with stoli..  Imagine 40 proof liquor mixed with 80 proof liquor and I'm drinking this shit down..  We will just say there is a period of time I don't remember..  I think I called a girl from work and made an ass out of myself..  I'm pretty sure cuz she hasn't called me since..  And of course me being the pussy I am avoids that shit like the plague..  well just say time lapsed for a while here and next thing I know I wake up to Mike23's Girl Rachel drawing a palm tree on my face in permanent marker.  Now I didn't mind so much cuz she is probably the hottest girl I know but eventually it gets annoying so I think I roll of the couch and tackle her..  Then the rest of the night is me being a drunk idiot running around yelling at everybody because I remembered I ordered a pizza and someone brought it to me and I paid for it.. but it was gone..  I finally hunted down the damn freshman who took it and threatened to blackball him and kick his ass..  Then just said fuck it and went to lay down and watch family guy..  Ahh what a night..  Friday night some interesting shit happened too but right now I'm pulling an all nighter so I gotta go to bed..  Peace out all my homies in computer land..
