FAGGOT DRIVER BITCH. eventually at 8:20 i came back to krispy kreme, bought 2 75 cent donuts cuz i thot i needed 50 cents for a call, cuz of tax i got 35 cents so i bought another donut to get an extra quarter and threw the dime away so i had 2 quarters, but i found out calls are 35 cents. damn. called, waited in front of the theater, saw dorian! so i inexplicably went to hide, i came back and WTF, alex came running to me in a weird kinda-sorta-not hug thing. i said what happened, natasha's like, "poor child." they stole some stick thingies from lowe's...my sister and wife are juvenile delinquents! sindy got some bright shiny stickers from borders. we put our hands in some fountain which was warm to me cuz i was freezing but it was cold to the others. then my dad came and i left. he's really good at making me feel guilty.
