But it was really expensive ($5.95 for a roll), so I passed.  Plus, it was the cafeteria, so who can trust the fish?  They probably got an accidental shipment of raw fish -- instead of, I don't know, acorn squash -- and figured they had to do *something* with it.  I have very little faith in the law school cafeteria.  I do, however, have renewed faith in building maintenance, which fixed my slow-draining toilet while I was in class today.  I realize that by writing about sushi, swine, and toilets in the same post, I'm opening myself up to all sorts of odd google searches resulting in a link to my page.  But I really have nothing more interesting to say today.  A quick TV tip: Dave Chappelle's sketch comedy show on Comedy Central last night -- pretty funny.  I recommend.
