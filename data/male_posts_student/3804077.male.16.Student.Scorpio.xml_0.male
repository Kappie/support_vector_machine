Happens to be that my aunt gets sick and we all have to get home. Not like I really care or anything, but damn, I was out for 3 hours expecting a fucking movie! Where the hell is it?! Who the hell knows now. They said they'll take us to see it tomorrow... I won't care by tomorrow. -.-' I was waiting all day for my girlfriend too man! She came online about 10pm her time, she was cleaning the whole time.. *hopes she's not a neat freak* I can't clean that damn long! xD I'm sorry but its true.. Is it bad to always dress in black? My aunt wanted me to change into something else because I was in all black man, I didn't but damn, she don't need to say it like its something bad. Well she really didn't say it, it was more like from her to my cousin to me. >:( Bastards confuse me! This things pretty cool though man, don't know much to put, but I try. :P Anyways. I'm out again. *poof*
