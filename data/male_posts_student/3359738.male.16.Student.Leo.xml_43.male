Hosting an employee's project; how nice of 'em. :) (Oh, and in case you were wondering what the hell Orkut  urlLink is .)   -*Update*-  I found  urlLink this article , and I quote:  Orkut means "to cum" in Finnish, although we don't know if Mr and Mrs Buyukkokten, who are Turkish, knew that at the time they christened their son. Perhaps the choice of Orkut, and the orgasmic name, are a sophisticated joke by the management.    (Go Google! you rock!)
