Some people are saying "Now that Saddam Hussein is captured terrorist attacks will be less organized." But Saddam has been hiding under a rug for the past few months. But actually terrorist attacks are more organized than ever.  Also since Saddam Hussein was captured violence has increased. "US forces shot dead 11 attackers who ambushed them in Samarra, northwest of Baghdad, in an upsurge of violence in restive Iraqi towns and as debate raged over the fate of captured former president Saddam Hussein. ( urlLink Yahoo! News - Deadly violence rages in Iraq after Saddam Hussein's capture ). In a separate attack, approximately 30 Iraqis began firing on a unit returning from a weapons cache, the unit returned fire killing one of the attackers."  People also have been saying that "Now that we have captured Saddam Hussein we will finally have some questions answered." HA suck for people who think that, because guess what? He isnt talking!  Yeah thats aboot it
