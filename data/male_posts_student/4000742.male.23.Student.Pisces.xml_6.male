We have had one quiz for every subject now, with two quizzes in QAM. I did well in the first QAM quiz, but committed an extremely silly mistake in the second one.   Today we just had a quiz in IT for Management. This was a bit unusual in format because apart from a few true/false questions and one question on databases, it had a crossword of IT terminology to be filled up for 5 marks (in a 10-mark quiz). I didn't really have any problems and smashed the quiz.  Tomorrow is the secondOrg. Behaviour quiz. And we expect 3 more quizzes in the next week, which is also the last week before mid-term exams begin.
