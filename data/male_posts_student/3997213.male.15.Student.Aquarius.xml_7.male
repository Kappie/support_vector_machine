Mom was at work. we watched Dora the Explorer and her Pirate Adventure. Oh how I love that movie! Reid came home, Rachel went to stay with our cousin Caila and mom came home to take us to Sam's. We had to get hot dog buns for Hotdog day on Sunday. It's for the township's adult softball team and I usually help with my mom. But wait a second. JUST going to Sam's sounds way too easy. No way. Mom needed to stop and get a replacement glass for our lampost. Dad knocked it out mowing the lawn. Typical. Anyway, to make it short, we ended up going to THREE different glass places (never knew there were so many) and not one place could fix it. Of course. Everyting always has to be complicated. Sam's wasn't bad. The sample ladies were there, never fail.  We came home from Sam's, I had to get to gymnastics. Reid had to get to soccer camp and Rachel was having a friend sleep over. I went in the pool for about an hour then got ready to go to the gym. Once again, that sounds way too easy. Riley had to go and color on the carpet. Oh boy! Mom was mad. I think it's still there too. We tried vinegar and it kind of got most of it off. Still visible though.  Gymnastics was tiring. Worked my butt off on the pommel horse, rings, and vault and I'm suffering now. I think I pulled my shoulder on the rings doing inlocates. Ouch.  Dad picked me up and I came home to watch Big Brother at 8:00. I love that show! Lori was evicted. Drew won HoH.  Now I'm watching Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen with my sister and her friend. Lindsey Lohan is way better than Hilary Duff!
