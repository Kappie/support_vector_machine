All of the colors are effed up ("eff" was used by Kramm yesterday in his racer name for go-karting and Tyke liked it so he is using it a lot) and he just wants to see things normally again.  But today was pretty short again.  Since his last blog Tyke has sat around and watched tv and nursed a headache which is mostly gone now but still some remnants are around.  Tyke went to Refuge again tonight.  Dotti picked him up but he had a headache at that point and had one for a while during Refuge but it did go away after a while.  Tyke talked with some of the Sly Lion boys there.  He is becoming pretty good friends now with those guys.  And he is getting to know more of them too.  Which is cool cuz they are all cool.  He might even be in the same dorm as some of them at WSU.  That would be great.  Just hanging out with them is fun.  Good thing Dotti and Purdy and Haras hang out with both them and Tyke cuz those are fun times.  So pretty soon Tyke is...hmmm don't know where Tyke was going with this sentence.  That is pretty much all for today's 3rd blog entry.  Close to a record.  But not.  Cuz of that "one day."  You all probably remember that day.  Or at least you should if you are a long time blog-reader.  Which you should be.  Avalon tomorrow.
