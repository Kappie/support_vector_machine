She must have walked on water  I cried at nursery, could not tie my laces  Watched her glide across the room with poise  My dance instructor used me for a doormat  Her elegance was mindful, never forgetting her  Sat out the waltz, hampered by the hernia in the ball-room   She must be the sister of music  I nearly drowned in the shower singing  Melodies of her laughter ringing true  Tied tongue, a sly cat trips out with a devilish purr  Her harmonies quell violence, claiming you captive  Joined the sing-along, soul hollering a dyslexic song   She must be the definition of beauty  Consoled by comments of inner grandeur  Honest eyes penetrating, piercing the frail façade  Journeying in the arid places, observing sad faces  Her still splendour, faithfully sculpting its own art  Masterpiece I may be, broad strokes you see   She is the loveliest maiden by far  Born to be forlorn, etched by a scar  Fair mermaid on land, sustained with a kiss  Invitation to intimacy, closeness is bliss  Her warmth nurtures life, fostering peace  May the cold rebellion be shattered in defeat?   She is the loveliest maiden by far!
