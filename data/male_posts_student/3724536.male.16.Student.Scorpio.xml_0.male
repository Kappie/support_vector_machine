I even got back my maths objective paper today.. damn why cant teachers take more time marking papers..?? turns out i got 5 questions wrong compared to the 3 i was expecting.. big letdown for me. Even worse was seeing other classes get back their accounts marks and looking at their scores, that alone is depressing enough (u can stop laughing over there dom). I actually got conned by someone in another class when he told me he got the lowest mark in the class which was 74. I couldnt believe it but he just kept going on and on about it and making it sound so realistic. Thankfully another friend came and told me it was all B*S so i could breath easy for the rest of the day...  Well with the end of exams i can finally do somethin ive been waiting to do for the past 2 weeks - Watch Movies!! its quite good timing that exams end just as spiderman 2 comes out.. sometimes i wonder whether teachers actually plan for it to happen this way.. nah they couldnt hve im just dreaming... Hopefully ill be able to drag a few friends along to watch this. It feels like everyone is not really eager to watch this movie or they hve already started glueing themselves to textbooks.. well i suppose i should be doing that soon but just not yet =P
