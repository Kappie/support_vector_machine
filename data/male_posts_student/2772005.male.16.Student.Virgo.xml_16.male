The heads are as follows- 1- PC (Prateek)- No surprises here. With his marks in the boards, and hiis extensive extracurriculars, it was almost confirmed that he'll be headboy. I'm very pleased for him. Lord knows, he deserves it. 2- Vrinda Marwah- I have no idea whether she's head boy or head girl, all I know is that she's one of the heds. Vrinda is a female, or so her birth certificate says. With her lion(ess) looks, and deep manly voice, its hard to say. Anyway, we now move on to  3- Damini Bansal- Lord knows she's worked for this, and has managed to come out tops in a close competition between her, Sonali Punhani and Shefali Chadha. I'm happy for her too. Now is the 'surprise' This batch of class XII has Zafar Khursheed in school. Despite a less than stellar board record, and a not-quite-full extracurricular resume, he's become head boy. To be fair to him, he's a very nice guy, and doesn't ram his family down one's throat. As a student, he's sober, well-behaved and an overall decent boy. However, he's nothing exceptional.  As an appointment, I have no objection to him. His behaviour, as well as he fact that he's a good basketball player(I've not seen it, but he's captain, so it does count) should ensure he'd be an appointment. Preferably in the Sports section, or the students council. Hell. even the Post of Prezzzie, student council, chalta hai.  But head boy? I don't think so.  Everyone is very upsetwith him, and with Chona ma'am, I m, oddly enough, feeling sorry for him, He tries his hardest to act like a normal student, and its scarcely his fault that he knows ma'am in a non-official capacity,  Unfortunately, he's become one. And that is going to deeply affect the credibility of the school, as well as of some other people. Though, like every instituition, the school has already had a lot of politics, its never been so unsubtle as this.  Khair, que sera sera...
