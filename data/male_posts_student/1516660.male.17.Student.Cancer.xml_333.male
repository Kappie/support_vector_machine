Today early early morning, I was chatting with Manda. Long time never chat with her le. I can say I really enjoyed myself. HaHa. I am quite amazed with Amanda's analysis. It makes a whole lot of sense, really. I could have NEVER thought out of that. Heh Heh Heh. Meow meow!  I woke up at 8+, took a very quick bath and watched my TV. I ate chee cheong fun. At 11, I didn't come online as usual because I want to watch HZGG. Such anxiety! Such a daring escape! Even ducks were meowing! After lunch and HZGG, I came online at 1.  Hmm. What did I do? I spent he whole day downloading a MTV, Beyonce's Me, Myself and I. Darn! I can't find Bo Si Mao's MTV. So hard to find de. XC told me it was because the MTV is not releashed yet. So meow! I can't even get into Kazaa, some error (again!). Sigh. I meowed online till 5, when I go out to bvuy dinner.  Well, I brought dinner. Fried rice for me brother, chicken rice for moi. Ywah. I came back, ate while watching Unbeatables III. After that, I went to bath and came online lor. How meowful!!   Ayiah. I dunnoe what to write. I am going to Ikea with Wendy tomorrow, but it all depends on her mood, I guess. She just now told me maybe she's not in the mood to go. Hmm...have to see first. I don't think I wanna go PJ. The thought of  it  drives me crazy. So, nah-ah to going PJ.   Oh well. I am going to end this entry le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
