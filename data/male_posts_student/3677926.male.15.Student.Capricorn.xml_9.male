The Boston Celtics, the San Antonio Spurs and the Los Angeles Lakers have been regarded as the best teams in the NBA. Championship banners can be seen in their home stadiums, but when asked which team is the most well supported, well there can be only one Los Angeles Lakers. Celebrities like Jack Nicholson, Steven Speilberg, Denzel Washington, Leonardo DiCarphio, Usher and Justin Timberlake have been to the Staples Centre regularly supporting Kobe, Shaq and Co.   Prior to the season, drama have been surrounding the Lakers’ season (as usual). Speculation has pondered over Phil Jackson’s future as head coach of the Lakers, Shaq and Kobe have been throwing verbal daggers to each other, Shaq was threatening to quit if he didn’t get a contract extension, Kobe’s future as a Laker with his court case and his contract running out at the end of the season, the arrival of Gary Payton and Karl Malone. Derek Fisher’s contract is also due to end after this season and Rick Fox injured during last season’s playoff.  The season started well for them but things weren’t as rosy as it seemed afterwards. Karl Malone got injured in December 2003 against the Denver Nuggets (if I am not mistaken) and the Mailman was forced to miss over 30 games this season which was more than he has missed in his first 18 seasons at the Utah Jazz. Some questioned his credibility when he left the Jazz to join the Lakers (with the “Glove” Gary Payton) to find an illustrious championship ring but who can blame him when he has tried for nineteen seasons (reached the Finals several time) and failed each time thanks to a certain Michael Jordan. He was also chasing records when at the Lakers.   The team looked unsettled with Gary Payton voicing his unhappiness to the press about the lack of playing regular minutes and Kobe was forced to leave for Colorado and fly back to games during the season, but when he was forced to face the court and fly back, the Lakers has won all the matches. Rick Fox and Karl Malone came back from injuries and the Lakers were at full force but still they weren’t as dominant as they should be.   The drama continued when Karl’s mother died during the season and that tested the team’s togetherness and everyone in the NBA sent their best wishes and condolences to him and his family but Karl proved strong and continued with his goal: to win a ring. The famous line “Offense wins matches, BUT Defense wins championships” has been said on countless occasions and the critics seemed to be right but the Lakers (as usual) defied the odds and proved them dead wrong. Kobe and Shaq lead them to a late charge to become the second seed in the west. They left the regular season with a 56-26 record and headed for the playoffs.  “The Fab Four” as they are dubbed proved to be “The Fantastic Two” when Kobe and Shaq seemed to be winning matches for them. Shaq and Kobe both cheekily said they were only 99.99999% fit and left the other teams worried. People were starting to question the other two; Karl “the Mailman” Malone and Gary “the Glove” Payton but the team backed those two.   Players in the team said that Karl Malone has been the “Big Brother” in the team, giving them advice when they needed it the most; helping Kobe deal with his court case, inspiring young rookies and players like Luke Walton, Kareem Rush and Brian Cook as well as seasoned pros like Shaquille O’ Neal and Gary Payton. He brought togetherness to the team. Gary Payton on the other hand brought a loud mouth, steals, improved ball distribution among the team and a capital “D” in the word “Defense” as he pummeled most of the point guards defensively except probably Jason Kidd. When the team had a strong bond, a feeling of togetherness and the hunger to win a championship again, the Lakers were all looking at the same direction. Kobe felt for Karl Malone and he has said that he wants to win this Championship for Karl and that made Kobe even more popular.  It was Playoff time again and in the first round, the Lakers had to face the Houston Rockets. Kobe had a quite a tough time guarding Steve “Stevie Franchise” Francis while Shaq had to face a triple-team from Yao Ming and the “Hack-a-Shaq”. For those of you who don’t know, Shaq is a horrible free throw shooter and they (the opponents) deliberately foul him to make him shoot free throws. Anyway after five grueling games for Kobe and Shaq, the LA Lakers won the series 4-1. During the series, Shaq said,” no one will ever guard me one on one, never, ever, never and ever, never, ever.” In the Western Conference semi-finals, the LA Lakers had to face the defending NBA Champions, the San Antonio Spurs. Karl Malone had the tough task guarding former MVP (Most Valuable Player) Tim Duncan and Kobe had the duty to break down the defensive brick-wall of Bruce Bowen. The series looked as if it was going to be s sweep San Antonio’s way when they led 2-0 but those two matches were at home. The media was looking to have a go at the Lakers once again saying that the Lakers with added reinforcements in the form of All-Star veterans Karl Malone and Gary Payton weren’t able to beat the Spurs who were without “the Admiral” David Robinson who retired last season. They were also saying that great players do not make a good team and stuff like that but what did the Lakers do. They came back 0-2 to win the series 4-2 and it finished in drama.   Game 5 at San Antonio, 0.4 seconds to go in the forth quarter with the Lakers looking dead and buried, Derek Fisher came out to hit a clutch two to lead the series 3-2. At the Staples Centre, the Lakers did a professional job to win the series and send the Spurs packing. Up to now, the Spurs fans and the team are still shocked and seething with the lost at Game 5.  The Lakers had to watch a Game 7 between the Sacramento Kings (or Queens as Shaq refers to them) and the Minnesota Timberwolves. Kevin Garnett showed the world why he was named the 2004 MVP when he led the Timberwolves to victory with an inspired performance. Karl Malone had to do all the dirty work again in this series guarding KG and he was victorious. The press and certain fans said that the Lakers only won because Sam Cassell was injured with back spasms. In Game 2, there was nearly a fight going on between the Lakers and the T-Wolves. Karl Malone was ejected (which is an equivalent to a red card in soccer) but he claimed that he was just doing so because the referees didn’t take action when Derek Fisher fell on his back after what seemed to be an illegal screen from one of the players from the T-Wolves. Shaq came out to say that this series was no longer a basketball match but it has turned into a football game. Before Game 3, the game was built-up to be a game which was not for the weak of heart but nothing happened and LA won leading the series 2-1. When leading the series 3-1, they had a chance to bottle it at Minneapolis but failed and it was crunch time at the Staples Centre for a Game 6. If they lost game 6, the series would be tied at 3 a piece and it would be a near impossible mountain to climb at Minneapolis to win the ever-crucial Game 7. It was DRAMA time once again at Game 6 in LA. Who would have ever thought that Kareem Rush would come out of nowhere to score six crucial treys (three point shots)? Well thought so that you guys would be like WHO IN THE BLUE HELL IS HE? Well now you know. Kareem was 6-7 from the three point line and was the X-factor for the Lakers. Lakers won the series 4-2.  Meanwhile in the east, the number one seeded Indiana Pacers crashed out to the Detroit Pistons and the stage was set. The Los Angeles Lakers versus the Detroit Pistons with Game 1 in LA. Leading to the finals, several storylines were set up for the Lakers. Phil Jackson chasing an unprecedented tenth NBA Championship ring, Kobe’s state of mind (with the pending court case in mind) and the inevitable; Karl Malone and Gary Payton looking for their first ring.  The Lakers were the odds on favorites to sweep this but that didn’t happen. In Game 1, Shaq dominated the paint but the Lakers still lost and the result left the basketball world flabbergasted. Some people said that Detroit won because the Lakers had one more day off than the Pistons and (they) the Lakers were disoriented for the match. Others said that Kobe Bryant wasted too much energy guarding Rick Hamilton (the world’s best conditioned player) in order for him to make an impact during the match especially in the forth quarter. I personally think that those two factors played a part but most importantly was the fact that the Pistons put more defensive pressure on the Lakers than what the Lakers put on the Pistons. Ben and Rasheed Wallace fought for every rebound and every shot was contested by them. In contrast, Shaq just stood in the paint and waited for rebounds to come to him but he was and still IS a factor offensively. He is probably the best centre on the offensive end but certainly not the best defensively. He is after all the league’s Most Dominant Player which was a title he gave himself.  Game 2 on the other hand was a classic inspired performance from the team from Tinstletown. The lead went back and forth between LA and Detroit. If it wasn’t from rookie Luke Walton, the Lakers would have been down and out. Luke who is a rookie in his first NBA Finals game gave an impeccable performance dishing out 7 points and 8 assist from the bench. Karl Malone struggled throughout the game after a knee injury early in the game but he still managed to finish the game but the star of the game was Kobe Bryant. Shaq had a good game but that was overshadowed by Kobe’s clutch trey that sent the game into OT (overtime). The game ended 89-89 in regulation time and in overtime, it was all LA. Kobe and Shaq outscored Detroit single handedly 10-2 in overtime. The game finished 99-91 in favor of LA. Kobe was the star of the show and Luke was the starlet.   Game 3, 4 and 5 were all in Detroit with LA facing injury woes with Karl Malone and Derek Fisher both having injured knees and Devean George having a lingering ankle injury from Game 1. The media were all questioning coach Larry Brown with his tactics and some fans were wondering whether Detroit could recover from the huge Game 2 loss. The media were saying that this would be like the 2000 NBA Finals when Larry Brown coached the Philadelphia 76ers. In that series, the 6ers won the first game but the Lakers rallied back to win the next four games to win the Championship. Before the game, Detroit’s fans started screaming outside the Lakers’ hotel and the players entered Game 3 without much sleep.   People who predicted a blowout from the Lakers were dead wrong as it turned out otherwise. The Detroit with their signature rock-solid defense got the better of the Lakers for most of the first two games. Game 3, 4 and 5 were swept by the Detroit Pistons. The NBA Finals ended 4-1 in favor of Detroit. None of the other Lakers put in decent numbers except Kobe and Shaq and even Kobe had a lackluster series apart from Game 2. That was probably the main factor for the losses. On the other hand, Billups, Hamilton, Prince, the two Wallaces (Rasheed and Ben) were flawless and the bench supplemented them.  With all due credit to the Pistons and their outstanding performances, the Lakers could have won if they had dealt with “things” better. For example, why didn’t deal with Kobe, Shaq, Fisher and Phil Jackson’s contracts earlier? If their futures at the club were settled, then maybe they would have done a better job. This is similar to Manchester United’s season a few years ago when the team didn’t win a trophy because Ferguson said he was going to retire at the end of the season. And why bring Gary Payton in when you have a reliable point guard in Derek Fisher? Payton was good at the beginning of the season, but since then he hasn’t been the player that he was when he was at the Sonics. Malone was a good singing because the Lakers have not had a reliable Power Forward and furthermore Robert Horry has just left for the Spurs.   Overall this season was failure to the Lakers. Even though they reached the Finals but they still lost, so what have they achieved? Nothing! They may have to start with scratch next season as the team is likely to be dismantled. Phil Jackson looks likely to take a break from coaching, Malone and Fox may (or may not) retire or they may join another team, Payton, Fisher and Kobe may opt out to join another team and Shaq may be traded as his contract negotiations is going nowhere. It is a pity that the most formidable duo in basketball ever in the form of Kobe and Shaq may be torn apart and after three championship rings, the nucleus of this team had to be broken up. This will be a bitter pill for every Laker fan to swallow but we just have to sit back and see what the future lies for the Los Angeles Lakers!
