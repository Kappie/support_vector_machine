News - Senator says US may need compulsory service to boost Iraq force   Chuck Hagel is bandying about the idea that we need to begin a draft to fill out the ranks in the Iraq Campaign.  Never mind that the recruiting goals have been exceeded, and while some are selecting to leave the service, many more are answering the call.  While Iraq is tying up a lot of soldiers, we aren't in any real danger of being short of manpower.  The issue ultimately is the appropriate use of the bodies we have in theater.  Chuck Hagel has an 'R' after his name, but he's more of a RINO (Republican In Name Only).  If you google him, he has a long history of being against the war, and he's consistently a thorn in Bush's side.  Talk of draft is just another way to scare people and get his face on the TV.  What is it they say?  Not a single Senator can shave in the morning without seeing a President in the mirror.  A draft is really a dumb idea (aside from an Armageddon scenario where the US is being invaded).  Conscripts make lousy soldiers.  They get killed, and they get others killed.  Any sensible human being would rather serve in a volunteer outfit.  At least that way you know the guy next to you has chosen to be there, and is likely to hold up.  We've proven, in the post Viet-Nam era, that a volunteer force is the best way to wage war.  Calls for a draft are nothing more than irresponsible, unneccesary scare mongering, and makes little military sense.  Don't pay any attention to Hagel.
