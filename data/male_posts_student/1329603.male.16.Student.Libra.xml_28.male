I'm sorry, everyone. I don't mean to be a narcisisstic tit all of the time, it's just so hard to break out of the human condition. I'm not saying "Oh, I don't care, it's just human" because I don't want to be normal and human. We're all more than the sum of our parts. I like to think I am too. It's hard to be me though, any more, to be honest. *sighs* Ah well, life does go on. Why, I'm not sure, but it does, regardless. Carry on regardless, who sung that? Paul Simon? I don't know.  Anyway... tired after Evesham, stupid bush ripped my hand... bush... yeah... but it hurt, anyway. It was a good blow-through though. I didn't get to go on trombone but I played at the best of my ability on the baritone. I even managed to remember all 4 sharps in Love Changes Everything and I kept count during the theme tune for The Trap.  OH, and I really want to hear a recording of Leoncavallo's Pagliacci. It's an opera about a clown, or something like that, it's just what I've heard sounds cool. Winchcombe have a brass band arrangement of what in English is called On With the Motley, I can't remember the Italian for it. Although it MIGHT make sense to ask Scott I think it would be asking a bit much to expect him to know the word for MOTLEY after not learning it for long.  General remarks from Sam about my blog being mean... general 'catty remarks' as she put it. Amy (Boris/Brissa) is actually talking to me a bit, she's generally being quite cool and not overly-hyper, which is unusual. So... hoorah.  "I was dreaming of the past, and my heart was beating fast, I began to lose control, I began to lose control. I didn't mean to hurt you. I didn't want to make you cry. I didn't want to hurt you. I'm just a jealous guy."  Love, Jon Roskilly
