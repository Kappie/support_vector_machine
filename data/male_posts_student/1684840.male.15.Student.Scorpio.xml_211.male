I've reached the stage of ultimate boredom lying in bed and I've decided to update my blog.  I'm really excited about tomorrow, well it's today now  !  The muscles around my eyes are hurting now and I think it's time for sleep, if I can get any.  The guest list to the party has shrunk to 6 people and it could still go down yet.  Hopefully it won't of course.  I'm off now, or I'll be thrown around Nemesis half asleep... cya!
