Like alysha, i think lately i've just fallen so far. so fast. a tumble right down to the bottom,not a stumble. everything seems to be so wrong these days. Everything is soflawed, nothing seems to realli b going right. not satisfied with much.        i guess ive been a bit strange lately, but yeah, i realli treasure those who accept me as i am, and nothing more. while i was watching the'birthday bash' on"oprah" , it was talking about CSI. crime scene investigation for those who are so naieve.(bot forensics)They go through all the scientific devices they usein reali life to solve crime. There was one bit that realli striked me. There was a doctor who investigated carcass for a few months up to ayear or two.These people die a natural death, and the family wants to know why they died. She slowly unpackages them, and takes samples to be screened etc. Trying to find out why they died.        In one of the carcasses, she takes apart the body. Like an animal in the butcher, the body is dissembled. i see a row of ribs, like the spare ribs u c in the butcher. It reminds me of how fragile the human body is. We are NOTHING much realli, than a bit of flesh and meat. So fragile to disease andaccidents. We are vulnerable, though when we are alive, there's is soooo much life in the voice, in the expression, in the face, the warmth of the palm.In reality, we are very vulnerable, and just like the animals u see in the butcher. We are no less than them, in a biochemical sense. Life is truely precious.        There's a song by nathan tasker. Lysh and i realli like it.        We go to God as we are.    We can offer him nothing, and bring him nothing   but   he loves as JUST AS WE ARE.    the amazing thing is that he will       love us no more,       and he cannot love us any less.     A  lthough we bring him nothing, we are changed by his love.
