Overtime was approved pretty much all week so I was working pretty much everyday for more than I was scheduled for. It caught up to me though.  Christie left yesterday to go back to Toronto for school, and Geri  I picked her up around 4:00 am to take her for breakfast and drop her off at the airport for 5:30am. I then went back home and slept until 8 and headed to work after that. Then I worked my 10 hour shift being extremely overtired - so I slept like a baby last night.  This morning is actually good, I feel refreshed and back in the game. There aren't too many people here yet as most will come in around 11:30, but either way we aren't too busy today. Let's hope it stays :)  So basically I am just sitting here at the lounge with not much to do until 9:30 when I sign my life away for the next 10.5 hours - I guess I can cope though :)  I wanted to make a quick update - I have some poetry to post in here later.  .: Sinful Misery :.  urlLink My Site   Later, for now :)
