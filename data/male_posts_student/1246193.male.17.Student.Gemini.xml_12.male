I have lots of friends that I didn't put on the list.  I only listed the people that I talk to on a daily basis, I mean actually talk to.  Not just a "hi" in the halls, but a conversation.  I am sorry to all those people that I consider my friends that were not put on the list, but if I listed everyone that I say hello to, it would take forever.  I hope I didn't offend anyone, if I did then maybe you should kill me or something.  Thank you Elizabeth for bringing this to my attention, I apologize.
