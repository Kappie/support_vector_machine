Anyways, karma came and bit me in the ass.  I was being a big jerk, and I cut my thumb off.  Ok, so Im lying.  I didnt cut it off, but in my best Iron Chef impersonation, I cut a huge divot in it.  Like, filet.  No flap, just cut clean off with a big hole in my thumb.  Im such a dumbass.  It kept me from going to TKD last night, which kinda sucked because there was NO ONE there.  Literally.  It was John and his kids and then the two little chinese kids that go.  Lark's foot is busted big time (no clue how she did it either).  Ray was on a ride with the Buell group.  Chris was probably working.  I didnt want to bleed everywhere.  Todd was probably off doing whatever it is that Todd does.  Maybe killing puppies or something.  I dunno.  I did end up going later after class and talked with John for a few minutes.  Poor Mitch (John's 3 yr old son) went head first into a rock on Sunday and now has 4 stiches.  Poor little dude.  John just kinda laughs about it and how much it sucks that he had to go to the emergency room on a Sunday.  I told him if it were a few years later, I would have done it for him =)  Oh well.  Yeah, so to get back on the good side of karma, I did a little bit of cleaning up at the dojo.  I wiped off the fan blades which were NASTY.  Covered in dust.  Probably have never been cleaned in the 4 years I have been there.  When I wiped them off, you could see the brown nasty stuff coming off of the blade.  Once again, nasty.  Did that and did the front door inside and out.  I dont really want recognition for doing it, cause its my place too and I  should  do it, but I also want someone to go "damn, thats a good job!"  Maybe Im just being selfish and I should shut up, but I think its nice to be recognized for going above and beyond... you know?  Anyways....  This week has been kinda lackluster.  I thought it was going to be great, but its just kinda turning out to be pretty average.  So many damn mixed feelings about everything going on in my life right now.  Sammy says she is having a quarter life crisis.  She was talking about how its rough to be far away from school.  Not the one she is at now, but U of I.  Life was much simpler back then.  I know that sounds horribly fucking lame, but it was.  It was our own little self contained universe where friends were close, having fun was always close by, bars, parties, class, projects, activities, the love of your life, everything was always in walking distance.  Now things have changed.  Welcome to the real world.  But the fucking sad thing is, Im not even in the real world.  Im in some fucking limbo where my life consists of going to some stupid ass community college, work at the zoo, living at home, and the only thing that keeps me sane, my Tae Kwon Do.  I feel like my life is in a rut right now.  Nothing makes me happy, and the one thing that did has been the greatest cause of stress in my life right now.  It sucks not knowing what you want.  It really really blows.  I dont know what I want, and right now, my goals are constantly changing.  This goal that I spoke of earlier and never eluded to is my new priority.  Im going to be a doctor.  Ive decided that becoming a nurse, while not a bad thing, and I could do it, but its the easy way out.  It was my "be done in 2 years so I could propose, get married, have a career and a life" plan.  Things change.  Im doing this for myself.  I came in wanting to be a doctor, and after all is said and done, Im coming out as a doctor.  I have never been so sure of this statement in my entire life.  So this is the new plan.  My goal.  My dream.  I may have to go it alone, but even that will only give me more resolve.  Now I just hope my meeting with the admissions people at CCOM will work out...  Also, back to COD kinda sucking.  Funny thing:  On the first microbio test, the class average was around a 78ish.  Only three people got over 100%  I was one of them.  Not to sound like an arrogant prick, but I think I may be out of my league.  Who knows.  Or Im just lucky.  Not to mention that class is at a weird time right in the middle of the day, goes Monday through Thursday, and just sucks.  Tonight is going to be fun... hopefully.  At the House of Blues for dinner with Sammy.  Thank you Q101 half price meals.  Nifty...
