My dad and I were driving around in Salt Lake and i looked at a store that had floor mats for sale. and in the front they had a doormat that was the american flag, what? This false patriotism crap has gone way too far, Im glad that everyone wants to let everyonelse know how their with us and not against us. And i think its terrific that everyone wants to express their patriotism but THE AMERICAN FLAG AS A DOORMAT? Whats wrong with you people? Why would anyone even make that? You know its bad enough that they make american flag boxers and bathing suites, but a doormat? That you wipe your freakin feet on? Why is this okay?
