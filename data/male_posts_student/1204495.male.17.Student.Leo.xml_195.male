Today i went to Manchester with phil, alice  danny. We met clare and heather there when we got there. Well it was interesting. I didn't really say that much, mainly because i've been doing a lot of thinking at the minute and would just rather not share some of my thoughts with people.   Theres a few people i don't trust, and i've got good reason not to trust them, and i don't think i'll ever trust them again.....its just the way i am, if someone i think i can trust, turns out to be someone i can't trust, then i just don't think i'd ever be able to trust them again. However there are a few select people that i trust a lot, people who've been there for me when i've needed them.  [will update later on when not so pissed off]
