 Y'all wanna know the worst part about Thomas' death? It was  probably  caused by some damned pit bulls that someone in the neighborhood is training to be fighters by walking them and letting them bark at dogs in fences. This asshole probably saw Thomas and let his dogs "get some exercise/training." What in the fucking hell is the matter with people these days? I mean, Thomas had a damned collar on! It's not like he was just a friggin' stray cat, he was someone's house cat! He was our house cat! 
 Damn, why in the fucking hell would you train some damned dogs to be really fucking aggresive and "teach" them by attacking people's cats? Let me find these mother fuckers who killed my cat. Shit. Damned mother fuckers, I'd go borrow Mr. Shelby's shotgun and give them a taste of their own medicine, fuckin' animal killers. 
 Fuckers.
