That 100 dollar savings almost cost me my life... at least I want to think it did.  I'll explain, don't worry.  So is my life worth that 100 dollars?  I kinda thing so, at least 99, and hell lets round up here folks.  my net worth has GOT to be at least 99 dollars.  So I get on the plane in Corpus Christi to change planes in Houston (we'll call it H-Town for the ease of understanding of Destiny's Child fans and african americans alike).  Wow.  The flight to Houston was fine, I got on my next flight to OKC which was somehow located in the international wing amongst fligths to Managua, Mexico City, and Merida... among other random destinations of international flare.  All of the check-in lines were packed too.. somehow I didn't understand why.  I guess people in Managua have to fly too at times.  I love seeing lines full of people about to pack onto planes to halfway around (or at least 1/4 the way around) the world.  It's crazy... like almost time travel.  We put all these people in a close space, transport them real fast, and suddenly they're really far away.   OHHH back to death.  So nothing was probably really life-threatening at all, but I get on the plane to OKC.  I buckle up next to the man from Guam sitting next to me and the girl with a pierced lip and torn fishnets.  We no more than push back 10 feet from the gate, and all the power goes off in the plane.  WHAT IF THAT HAD HAPPENED UP IN THE AIR?!  actually i think it woudlnt, it's just that the power never actually started after  they unhooked the ground power.  But still, it was kinda annoying to be sitting in a dark plane, with no lights, no air, etc.. next to 150 strangers (and by stranger, I mean they were STRANGER than normal).    Needless to say, they 'fixed' the power problem, and with fingers crossed the whole way, i flew safely back to OKC.  So really nothing cost me my life, or even close, but it was a fun lil' fantasy drama.  My car still sounds like i'm dragging chains behind it.  Gonna have to get that fixed along with the check-engine-light, front headlight, etc. this thursday.  Fuck spell check- i'm not doing it on this thing, cause i dont want to waste my time with things u'll figure out JUST fine anyway.  Like when it reminds me that sometimes i capitalize my "i's" and sometimes "I" don't.  and SOMETIMES i dont even put the right punctuation on DONT, now DO i?   hehe  Lets see.. final thought.. what will it be.  I had a group project today and made copies and bound the huge thing we created at King Kopy, you know the establishment right by Subway (for all 1 person who reads this, hi lauren).  Well we went to go eat before class at subway but the line was too long, good thing O'Connels Irish Pub is next door..  we managed to get a lil' buzzed before class.  Sure made those dumbass presentations we had to listen to more... wait no, they weren't more thrilling.  NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT.  In fact if i hear one more marketing presenation where greek life is referenced as "a really big consumer market" (granted it is in a college town)  or "cause u know like a lot of people live in houses and like see others and are influcned by like, like, how like, like.. how kappa kappa, like kappa, like what was i talking about?  I dunno it's like retailing strategy and stuff because like even my big and my lil' and my grand'lil'big'gran'sis'big'lil'step'sis'godchild'bastard'lil is like... um... go sooners"  G'night folks!
