But then again, something else happen. Sigh...they say that all things happen for a reason. I believe that, but we seldom see what the reason is. Anger has been getting into me. What's with all the jealousy? Somehow, I never get satisfied. In fact, every person out there seldom gets satisfied. It's our human nature. We search and pursue, but in the end, all are worthless. Only a genuine relationship with God will give true satisfaction. Does that mean I never did have a real relationship? It's so scary. I long for the peace. But I know in my heart that something else I can't let go, that is at the same time preventing me from getting this peace. Worldly desires, pride, what is it that I see in all these? People know that holding on to these desires will only cause more pain. Yet they are unwilling to let go for something better. They know, I know. What foolishness. The beauty of God's peace we have experienced it, yet we hold on to what's worst. Does anybody know? Maybe it's just human nature. Like they said, being a Christian doesn't mean a sinless life, our human nature is still there. But we are able to fight against it now. But we give in. Does our faith give us the will to hold on to it? In the end, I guess human will is weak. Guess that's what perserverance is all about. Recently, I talked to Charlene again. She's a friend I neglected. But she's still always there for me, always trusting me, always ready to open up. I'm surprised by her. She has gift, I don't know what to call it, but I know it's there. She makes talking to her comfortable. It's like she totally speaks her mind. It can be good or bad. But I guess, it isn't too good for us to bottle things up in ourselves. I use to that, and I finally had to let it all out by talking to someone. What if things burst out in another way? Sometimes, we should do some housekeeping of our emotional storage space. Not too much or too little. The content matters alot too. Anyway, thanks Charlene! I just bought a harmonica today. I want to learn it. And I just realised that it's so tough. Much tougher than the clarinet I think. But it seems fun. But I've never had good patience in learning. Hope this time, it'll be different. I had Physics and Chemistry Test today, Physics was OK, but Chemistry was a killer. But my mistake, cause I didn't study for Experimental techniques which came out the most. But wait! Rejoice in all circumstances! Yippee!!! (quite fake) Hey Adrian! Nola...the other person doesn't like me...I'm quite sure I think. Anyway, all this relationship kind of thing is too scary with many complications. Guess for now, I'll just stick to friendships. Simple and honest. I'm better with friends. At least I don't have enemies(I hope). Everytime things get a bit more, they just go disastrous. *sings 'Beautiful Disaster'* Though, it's disastrous, sometimes, you still think it's beautiful. Personally, I think all the drama serials are to be blamed for this. Cause everytime something bad happens, it still can seem beautiful when they reconcile and live happily ever after. People get blinded and continue hoping on these "script writer's creativity". Come on! Wake up people! We don't live in fairytale land, things are different in the real world. Anyway, it's nobody's fault that the scandal started, guess at this age, people just think that you're falling in love when you get closer to a girl.Hey! Snap out of it! Being an adolescent doesn't mean that Boy-Girl Relationship is always mushy substance. Anyway, BGR, the term is misused! It changes the concept of a relationship of a guy and a girl, such that they have to say that they are bro and sis. Nothing wrong with it, but using the 'kinship' method is degrading what it means to be a sibling or even a relationship like that of siblings. So becareful people. Ok...sorry...if I'm offending people. A bit "talkative" today. Long one huh? Ok...see you guys!
