Today's tip is for alternate browsers.  There are 4 in particular that I have tried out within the past couple of years, and now, here'a review of each one, all of which are alternates to Internet Explorer.   Mozilla Firefox 0.8:  Yeah, I know, Firefox 0.9 is already out, but I haven't downloaded that yet.  So, I'll give a quick review to Mozilla's Firefox 0.8.  This browser is FAST.  It runs on Netscape's technology, so it has absolutely nothing to do with Internet Explorer.  You can download extensions to maximize your browsing experience, and you can also download different skins.  It's a tabbed browser, so you no longer have to have several different windows open for all your internet activities.  It comes with a built in popup blocker, and it has blocked every single ad that even thinks about coming up, and you don't even have to see it.  Mozilla Firefox gets a  4.5 out of 5.    Avant Browser:  This one runs on Internet Explorer software, so its not as fast.  It is, however, a tabbed browser, that also comes with a popup blocker.  It's not as fast as Mozilla Firefox, but, it's still a pretty good browser anyway.  Avant Browser can be downloaded at www.avantbrowser.com for free, and it gets a mediocre  3 out of 5.    Opera:  This one doesn't run on Internet Explorer, similar to Mozilla, however, it's a very slow browser.  Opera claims that they have the fastest browser, however, I don't think it is.  Added features like tabbed windows can be found in better browsers, and this one doesn't even load all the images correctly.  Opera can be downloaded at www.opera.com.  Email and small other features don't make this one the best, but, it still is worthy of a  3 out of 5.    Netscape:  Even though the Netscape technology is much faster than Internet Explorer, it still works better with Mozilla.  This is the absolute worst browser.  It may come with a nice look, but, it's slow, it slows down and freezes a lot, and popups can easily sneak through.  When you download Netscape, you get Netscape Instant Messenger, which is simply a prettier version of AOL Instant Messenger, which is nice, and Netscape Mail, which is very slow, but doesn't require you to use a browser to check your mail.  Little features like this can be downloaded seperately, however, and that is why I give Netscape Browser a  2 out of 5.   So, Mozilla's Firefox is definitely the best browser out there, and you can also get Mozilla 1.8 currently, which is like the Netscape Browser, with email and stuff, but, not as fast as Firefox.  For anyone who has a slow connection, Firefox will help set the way and make your connection seem much faster.  It can be downloaded at www.mozilla.com. --------------------------------------  Well, that about wraps things up for today's installments of bagel.tech.  Here is everything we reviewed today, and some comments about them:  For Games we looked at ZUMA, from Pop Cap Games, on Yahoo.  The game has nice graphics, simple gameplay, and a high addiction level.  It received a  5 out of 5.   For today's Download of the Day, we looked at jetAudio, a media player that allows you to open different formats, including WMA, MP3, MOV, AVI, MPEG, WAV, and more.  You can create and look at lyrics while you play your music, and it's got a nice interface.  jetAudio received a  4.5 out of 5.   For today's site of the day, you got a look at Home Star Runner.  This site offers the best web cartoons, has a unique cast of characters, and has been around for a long, long time.  Home Star Runner has still got it, as it scored a  5 out of 5.   Today's tip, which is right above, showed you the best and fastest browser to replace the standard Internet Explorer.  We reviewed Mozilla's Firefox, Avant Browser, Opera, and Netscape, and Mozilla Firefox received the top marks as the best and fastest browser.  That's it for today's bagel.tech updates.
