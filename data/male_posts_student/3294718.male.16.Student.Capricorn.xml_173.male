I've got a burning in myself that only a lot of Halo can quench. But I smell like smoke and gotta shower and go to work. No pun intended on that smell like smoke bit. I really do. It's not bad, to tell you the truth. Also I went to Famous Dave's yesterday for supper and Ashley Grunewald and Mike Giese were there. They cut us short some cornbread and baked beans. It wasn't cool.  Let's do some Halo tonite or tomorrow nite! Tuesday night works too.
