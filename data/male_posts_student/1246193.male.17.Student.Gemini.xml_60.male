The speech was about "self-reliance".  Everyone was saying how self-reliant they are and I knew how self-reliant I am not.  I don't cook, I don't clean, which is not to say that I am not extremely clean, I don't contribute to our household.  Hell, I couldn't do a load of laundry if my life depended on it.  Sadly, I am not exagerating.  I don't even set foot in our laundry room unless I need to talk to my mom.  I am worried about college.  I don't share easily and if I have to use the same bathroom as everyone else on a floor I might just not go, to college I mean, not the bathroom.  How I hate worrying!  I just need to relax but I can't.  I thought about yoga but then I learned that it is considered unchristian because you are chanting to "nature", another diety.  I worried about going to hell for that one for quite some time.  I have tried for years but no matter what I do I have never been able to just let go.  I really think I might be one of those people that starts having panic attacks when I am eighteen and by my twenty-second birthday I have already had bypass surgery.  I don't like confrontation.  I hate being uncomfortable but I guess there's not much I can do about that.  So I guess I will have horrible health and die when I am about twenty-six from a massive stroke/heart attack.  But in the end it will turn out that it was actually an overdose.  Not on drugs or alcohol but on laundry detergent because I wasn't sure how much to put into the dryer.  The really sad thing is that it will probably happen.
