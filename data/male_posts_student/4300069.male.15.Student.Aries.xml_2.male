I missed Kasey while I was there and it was hard for me to do some of my work because she was on my mind the whole time.  But thats ok because she is my priority in life.  I didn't get tired walking up and down the stairs because of all the bikeing I did over the summer.  But like any normal day I am always tired for no reason at all.  I will let you go now and read some of my other posts, if I do anymore.
