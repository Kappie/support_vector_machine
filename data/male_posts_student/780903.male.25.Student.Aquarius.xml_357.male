I couldn't agree more.  I didn't take a prep course, but I did train to teach the LSAT for one of the major test prep companies -- and finished training feeling very glad I hadn't wasted my money on a useless twelve weeks of classes.  For people scoring on the high end of the LSAT scale and get into a top school -- the course isn't even designed for you.  They advise things like skipping a logic game because you'll "surely" run out of time, or outlining each reading comprehension passgae in detail "because it's hard to remember what you read as you go along."  Um, if you need to skip a logic game or else you're gonna run out of time, maybe instead of accepting that and knocking a bunch of points off your score automatically, you should just practice more logic games.  Practice on real tests from years past, under timed conditions, check your answers -- and you should eventually start to recognize what the test-makers are going for, and the right answers should become easier and easier to see.  The prep courses are taught by a script, and not a very good script.  It's designed for people who don't have the willpower to make themselves take practice tests -- not a good sign, if you want to be a law student, actually -- and who can't learn out of a book (again, not a good sign if you want to be a law student).
