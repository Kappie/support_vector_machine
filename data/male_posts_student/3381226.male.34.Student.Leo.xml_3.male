You know, those invisible ones.  Finally have a nice smile.  I don't feel too bad and my wife has been kind to me today.  She has been a real nurse.  Got me food and medicine.  I am thankful for her help.  Through all of this the highlight of my day is the fact that my daughter is feeling better.  Last week we started her two days a week at day care.  I'd like to call it pre-school but we would just be lying to ourselves.  While there she came down with some sort of hybrid stomach like flu thingy.  She started with diarrhea that left her bum very sore. (A word to parents, they make this stuff called triple paste ointment that really does the trick on a sore bottom.)  Then she got a runny nose.  By the time she woke up this morning she had barely slept and was crying almost non-stop.  I took a shower with her to see if it would help.  When I turned her back to the water she fell asleep on my shoulder.  When I got out we put her down and she slept for two hours.  She awoke as a new baby.  It made my day to see her doing better.  The sun rises and sets on that little girl.  All in all, a good day.
