My computer just crashed so here is the abridged version: Bouncing Souls and Anti-Flag killed, Tiger Army, the Casualties, and Flogging Molly were good, and Bad Religion personally rocked each and every of the 15,000 who attended. We got a lot of stuff signed, and I got one really good picture, which I'll put up some other time.   Yesterday, I went swimming and blew a tire.  Today, work. I've been drifting around since I got off work, not really willing to go anywhere but still searching for something to entertain me. I settled on an hour or two of Grand Theft Auto and reading about the history of punk.   I am thinking about forming some serious plans for tomorrow, though. I don't really have any money so I'll probably go up to the Oselands and hang out.  Not much new in politics today. Important Democrats are badmouthing Bush at the DNC, the right is responding with the usual half-truths and exaggerations, and the 12 undecided voters in the country make plans to move to Canada.   (lets hope they were leaning right)  Well, summer is now boring the hell out of me. I have no more plans, and although I am not content to while away the rest of the summer in obscurity, I probably will. I could've did some things differently, but too late for that now, so why second-guess myself?  Why am I speaking of summer like it is already over? August hasn't even started yet, and I celebrate the end of the prior year up until 7 a.m. on the first day of the next.   I kind of want to see I, Robot and the Bourne Supremacy. By which I kind of want to see I mean I will if there is nothing better to do. Now that I think of it, I could've did that today.  Tomorrow, I also could load those CDs I bought into my iPod. I've got 10-12 waiting to be loaded.   Anyway, I can't say I am interested in blogging at the moment.   See ya next time I feel like it.
