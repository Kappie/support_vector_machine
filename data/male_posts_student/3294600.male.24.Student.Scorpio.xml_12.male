Since then, I highlight and copy it before I press the submission button.  Thanks again Arion and Scott for getting me interested in it.  I got tired reading Middle Passage last night and finally went to bed sometime after 1 AM.  I finished halfway through the book.  I got up early this morning to read the book.  From 7 AM to 12:00 PM (minus 10 minutes to shower and get ready and about a 10 minute drive to Everett CC) I read.  When class began, I had about 12 pages left.  Class began and I found out we didn't need the second half of the book read until Wednesday.  I was pleasantly frustrated.  I'll finish tonight and that's one less thing I need to worry about.  I looked up my grade for Web Design and I have a 97% for the course.  I missed to quiz questions and it cost me 3% of my grade...Lame-O.  After Web Design I'm going to go home and relax for a bit before heading north to Mount Vernon to have dinner with family.  I'll write more later, probably.  Hope you're having a great Monday!
