Well I should say now, I was only writting what sean had said to me. Nowhere in that post was a biased comment from me. I was merely pointing out there was another side to the story which Ifelt needed to be heard. That's that cleared up. Anywho, I shall be expecting a visit from Mattius and Lesley-Anneous tonight. Fun as always. And my car needs petrol and I'm broke at the mo!!!! Damn expensive things.  Go and play in the fields of Barley my young learners. Life is too short to stare at a computer screen. Go. Go. GO! FUCK OFF!!!!
