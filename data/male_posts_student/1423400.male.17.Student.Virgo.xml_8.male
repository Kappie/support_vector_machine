I wake in the morning, and when there are no clouds im like "gee, its going to be a nice day today!" 2 hours later, pouring rain.  And it works in reverse, when it looks cloudy, it clears up by the afternoon.  Or sometimes it just stays cloudy, eeep.  Thanks god those chem worksheets weren't for marks, I would've beens screwed.  Oh yeah, and Game 7 today! Yes!
