Even if it wasn't PCW and it was somewhere else...! I wanted to hang out with my friends. Jeez... I'm soooo fuckin pissed.   Now she wants me to make noodles for her and Julie to eat. I don't wanna cook! Don't feel like it. Wtf... I hate this.  Krystal called earlier and told me that Mark and Nima were messin around and Mark punched Nima in the jaw and he started bleeding. Grr... that Mark! If he wasn't Nima's best friend/Vivo's boyfriend I'd have done something about it. I hope Nima's okay... I miss him.   Can't stop thinking about him... Ashegetam.
