Anyways, I am now home from Kathrin's graduation party. Oh man, tons of fun. Who would have thought playing frisbee at 11PM would be seen as juvinile fighting, and FOUR cop cars would show up? Oh man..How dumb is that? Sheesh.  Graduation is sad. There were some truely great people that I will never see again. That's destiny for ya'. Take a deep breath and smell the roses, realize how great that smell is, and then watch them wilt away. Haha, such a happy thought. Eh, it's not all like that. It's more like, take a deep breath, smell the roses, then pick 'em and keep them in a greenhouse forever. Yeah...That's more like it.  Time to go to bed. Kathrin, I forgot to give you your letter agian...Haha. What's new ^^, remind me tomorrow!     "It is better to die on your feet then to live on your knees"
