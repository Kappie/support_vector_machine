When everybody was revising the blue book, i was revising the blood Society notes. blood disgusting for the sec 1s and 3s. So outstanding. alright. Eng was slack lar. 50 min i finish in 15.   Society was alright... didn'T coz a lot of trouble. Something about SHOTOKU TAISHI'S, law number 17, how ta remember. whatever.   The rest of the Day was slack. i played too much com. haha, hehe.  Aha, i played piano oso, then got the blood teachers come to the room (it'S actually a hall, really got no more pianos liaoz... loLz) for their health check. WTF!? alright, i play lohz, and they look at me. blood disgusting glare by one. nvm, okie, practise for 2 hours, darn tired.  Baseball got a few strikes and feels good.  Wahaha  Gotta sign out.
