My initial goal in blogging here was that I would give everyone a humorous, yet insightful, perspective of everyday college life. But now it appears that I won't be able to do that anymore. Oh yeah, and I'm lazy also. Come to think of it, it's more like 75% laziness, 25% censorship.  So.....I'm pretty disappointed that nobody has come to visit me and Bob up here in Albany since last semester. Andrew came up to visit in November, and James in December, but that's it. LEAVE THE LOW-LIFE INFESTED WENDY'S PARKING LOT, FUCK THE "LET'S DRINK BEHIND A SCHOOL" ASSHOLES, and COME UP TO VISIT!!! You might say "Kevin! You hypocrite! I've seen you at the Wendy's parking lot a few times!" But it only took me a couple of times to realize how gay it was. You guys waste more time and money driving around North Rockland on the weekends than you would spend driving up to Albany for a few days. Here you would eat for free, drink for cheap, experience college life firsthand, and have a BLAST all at the same time. Fuckin' a, spend your weekends more wisely, ya numbskulls. Bob and I go out of our way to visit you guys everyone once in a while, so the least you could do is come spend a weekend with us!!! Most of you have cars and money -- the excuses are getting lame. Don't get me wrong: I love partying at college, but I can't tell you how much it SUCKS to not see your good friends once in a while! I'm getting sick of driving home for a weekend, hoping that I will spend it with my good [SMUT] friends, but then instead wasting it with a bunch of scumbag drug-addicts that swarm the streets of North Rockland looking for the next party to crash. Half of the time, they're not even welcome at Bob's place. They just somehow "wander" in without Bob's knowledge or permission. It's not North Rockland that sucks. It's THESE PEOPLE. THEY make it suck. You know who you are, and you are NEVER welcome with us! Don't even show your face!  Whew. I am angry and sleep-deprived which probably contributing to my little rant there. Now that that's off my back, let me move on to bigger, brighter things. Next weekend Bob and I will be coming home to TEAR UP North Rockland. This is going to be a weekend of monsterous proportions. Buildings will crumble, people will scream, and.....and....uh, well I guess not. But let me assure you, there is ALOT of shit going down and it's going to be ALOT of fun.  Until next time,  -BIGsmut!  P.S. The next person to say "I'm Rick James, bitch!" will have a broomstick shoved up their asses. Sideways. Move on folks, Chapelle's Show was so last week.
