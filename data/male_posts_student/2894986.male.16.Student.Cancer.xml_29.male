After a two week trip to Greece and Egypt, I am spending my final day trying to relax and catch up on lost sleep and an overall exhausting trip. Anyway, the trip was amazing. It is like nothing I have done before. But the stories will have to wait. I don't want to tell about everything in one blog. So make sure you check back in regurally to see happens next. You will read about my travels to the Parthenon, Great Pyramids of Giza, Valley of the Kings and more. The trip was very exciting and memorable and I hope you have just as much fun reading about my adventures. Stay tuned.  In other news, plenty more is still on tap for the coming weeks. This Saturday and Sunday I will be in Bowling Green for soccer State Finals. I'm really excited about the tournament and am expecting to have tons of fun. Our undefeated season came to and end last weekend. But now we have to the oppurtunity to turn the tides at State. Stay tuned for more information on this come Monday.  Also, my sixteenth birthdays is only 12 days away. You know what that means, I get my drivers permit. Yay!   There is so much happening in so little time. It's exhausting but is also tons of fun. Even when its finished I still have lazy days by the pool, trips to the lake, and hanging out with friends to enjoy. Ogh how I love summer.
