Well as many of you know im a big Will Smith fan, i love all of his movies and music and this movie was no exception. This is one of my favorite Will Smith movies ever. The animation the story and just the action and the acting were all top notch. If i had to give it a rating i'd give it a 41/2 stars out of 5.               Anywayz my birthday is 2morrow and i hope it will be a great day. On a suckier not it seems like it will rain on Monday and thats the day i should be getting my license. D'oh!       oh! speaking of D'oh! this pic is kinda funny
