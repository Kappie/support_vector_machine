(whahahaha... her practicals are pathetic, oops) then after that, me, shaun and shane send weeping to 85 to meet her friends... we had desserts there and talk for quite some while b4 we head our separate ways (erm, me and shaun same la...)  i got the chance to talk to some of them and understand them a little bit more... and i discover that most of them are not what they seem to be... all are weaker than they seem... anyway, i found out something from her... they had broken up... and from a friend that ken is not a good guy... and that he had even told some of his friend that ee kheng look ok only...
