I mean, I haven’t seen one of them in years!   Okay, the scene is that they have a middle-age woman (who’s blind folded) try your average frappuccino and the  new  DQ frappuccino. My first thought is, how many adults go to Dairy Queen for lunch? I mean, they always advertise kids meals and ice creams only a small child would enjoy. Then, once she finishes the first drink she tries the DQ drink. Than says “Mmm, I chose this one!” Then the two men recording her thoughts say “Okay, give me it.” And then the woman profusely drinks the latte frap and blocks the mans reach with her arm. Now I’m thinking “Why do they want the frappuccino back?!” And two “Is the frappuccino filled with drugs or high caffeine amounts, I mean, she began to get violent with the man and then continued to run into a door.” If it did this single .99 cent drink of this sort did this much damage to a 20 or 30 year old, imagine what it’d do to a 9 year old-candy psycho-ADD raging-bull of a child.   If anyone dares drink this latte frappuccino from DQ, tell me what kind of rush you get out of it!
