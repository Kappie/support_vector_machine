Then it started to happen, the gym started to suck me in, all of a sudden I couldn't stop going, I had to go more and more, and if I didn't go, even for a few days, I started to feel like shit, this is completely true, now I'm not saying the gym isn't really good for me, but its made my life a lot more difficult, now I've got to fit it in with everything else, and if I don't go I feel much worse than I did before I discovered it at all. So, I'm wondering what it is about this sort of exercise that gets us hooked, maybe its the whole ambiance of the place, because I play squash quite regularly also, and I don't feel any need to be there all the time, but the gym, well the gyms another matter, and if there is something about the gym that you get hooked on, is it good? I'm thinking maybe you just get hooked on the feeling of wellbeing you get afterwards, you know endorphines and all of that, so how about this, all gym users are drug addicts, I see them there, lying on the floor after doing 100 sit ups, high as kite from the endorphines, hell I'm one of them, I do it too, and it would be perfect, its completely safe and you look better afterwards, if only it wasn't so time consuming.
