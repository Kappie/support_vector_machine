More reasons why my self confidence is low -I got a 75% on my Psych test...first c in college, besides that test in Stats, which prompted me to drop the class. I was hoping there were erasure mark mistakes.  I was not so lucky -I got a 87.5% on my Sex test.  Disapointing only because I should get an A in the class. But in the diagraming portion I found the clitoris.  I should get double points, a gold star or something right ladies?  I think later tonight a hardcore rant against the man-squirrel in my rhet class is coming.  For now its Boston Red Sox playoff baseball and Family Guy.  College life does have some perks I must admit
