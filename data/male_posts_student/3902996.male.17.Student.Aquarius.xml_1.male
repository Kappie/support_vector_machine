That should be fun  Great, I will be at lunch with 2 cool girls, should be interesting..... Both I like, but I don't really know what to do from that point. I guess it seems like everytime I move forward with these type of feelings, I always get rejected, or horrible embarrassed... Or in some cases, completely ignored.... And trust me, that last one hurts the most, especially for me. I assume that's just because I always imagine like the perfect relationship, you know, all the corny stuff and when I don't get it I get disappointed. I only have myself to blame for that.  sigh, enough about my "matters of the heart" time to go to bed!
