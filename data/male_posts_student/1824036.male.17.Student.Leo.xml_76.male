We added about 10 lbs. of water that got absorbed in our clothes. In about 5 or 10 minutes there were 2" and 3" puddles forming under our feet. Everyone was sloshing around and doing "razorbacks" (you run at a full sprint and do a Pete Rose type, head first, dive into the wet ground). I did about 3 or 4 razorbacks, including one through a  HUGE  mud puddle. I was covered from head to toe in mud. Then it began to lightning, so we had to head inside for safety reasons.  We get inside and our coach says get clean clothes on and go to Mr. Van Pelt's room. I do as I am told peeling off layer after layer of wet soaking clothes...then it hits me...I had no clean underwear. I had to go "commando" for the time being. I put on my mesh shorts and shirt after I had cleaned the mud off of my body. While in Van Pelt's room we watched game-tape and a nice little highlight reel.  After all that, I got home and realized that Jadie had a volleyball game. But I more than likely could not attend, due to some internal family problems. But hopefully she will forgive me for not going. And by the way Jadie if you read this...thanks again for all you have done in my life! I really appreciate it even if I dont show it
