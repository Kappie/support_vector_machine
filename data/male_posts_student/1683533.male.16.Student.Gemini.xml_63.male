YOU CAN"T KILL OFF AN ENTIRE KIND OF MUSIC COMPLETELY .  It is impossible...there will always be some there...deep underground somewhere....Yes, punk hit the fan and now people think punk is the shit on MTV...but that doesnt mean punk is dead...that just means it is misunderstood....people don't know what punk is...they just aren't aware that the stuff on MTV isn't it....So there...I stated my point and I am done with this subject...it's so fucking stupid, it shouldn't even be argued about...its not dead!!   Punk's not dead it's sleeping...
