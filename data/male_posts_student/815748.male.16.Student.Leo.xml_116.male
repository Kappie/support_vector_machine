Most of my classes today have been fun; even the not-fun ones were better than like sitting in my room in Paris, waiting for the next meal for lack of a better thing to do.  Loren's new template is pretty cool, I saw that it was one of the most popular templates on the site where we get them.  I don't like his song, though.  I've discovered that I enjoy actual conversation a lot more than AIM, but there's never that much time to talk.  People have been cool to talk to anyhow; I like them a lot more than the French.  Oh, and my plane ride, despite being seven hours long, was really fun, figure out why.
