I'm not going to forget about you, buddy.  It looks like we'll be leaving Saturday morning/early-afternoonish. Probably around 10am or so. If you'd like a ride into Calgary, just be sure to be in the city before then. You could hitch a ride in on Friday night, or really early on Saturday.  We will, however, be coming back to Edmonton late Sunday evening, so if you want to catch Finger Eleven on Monday night, you'll probably need to catch a Greyhound home.  If you need a place to stay Friday or Sunday, I've got a love seat with your name on it!   Currently: Using the horrible DELL computers in the flooding Rutherford Library
