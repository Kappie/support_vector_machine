Not the primary school's. And my, was it cramped.  Supposed to go Atrium after the dismissal at 10.30am, along with KL. But, decided that I'll go shift a 6 speed shifter than a tiptronic one.... so I PS-ed him and followed Joshua and gang to SuperBowl for a few games first. After all, it was still early. Had 3 games, and I headed home to bath and get ready for going out later. Dilly-Dallied my time, then went out at around 3.05pm. Down at CS, I played WMMT the whole way, and finished at around 4.45pm. Tried to plan out a time plan in a way that if I catch bus 72 then switch to 53, I'll get to Serangoon MRT on time. But.... still reached the darn place at 6, and had to wait 40 minutes for *Mr Hia Big Shot* to come.. =P 10 minutes late worr~~ =x  So we met Tong Lam, and headed to Atrium to meet the rest of the bunch. Walked to HMV, then to Ngee Ann City. My legs were really tired and heavy by the time we walked back to Atrium... lol, save on bus fees... (-.-") Yeah, and we stayed at Baker's Inn to drink a cuppa tea and to chit-chat (talk cock to be more precise). Thanks for the treat of Iced Tea Aaron ! *lol*  11 .30pm, we left and took one of the last trains home. Alighted at Serangoon Station, and walked with Aaron all the way home. After all, the last bus was long gone by then, and a midnight surcharge on a taxi didnt sound too good, since its quite a short distance, and its so non-economical. Talked a bit on the way, and after we parted, I kinda thought of some of my problems (yet again.. yes I know...) while dragging two "logs" that were heavy like hell and still managed to clock a time of 15 mins to home ! What a suprise. >. .  Ahhh anyways, I had to adjust the time back to put in this entry, time now is 2.15am, so yeah, I guess I'm in need of some sleep... Dont want panda eyes to come and look for me... Enough problems for me le.... ~.~"
