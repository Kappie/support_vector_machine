Earlier today was a nice day though.  i woke up way to early and helped Jose with his eagle project most of the day.  i was hammering rebar and cuttin wood from 9 to 4.  After that i headed home and sat around a bit and decided to run, i ran about 3 miles (and damn it was hot/humid!) and then i had a really really relaxing jacuzzie tub bath!! omg i hadnt had one of those in a long long time i loved it i was all home alone and everything.  once relaxed we had a nice big family dinner and family time (both of which included laurnes b/f chris) and then i went out and i already told that story.  oh and jes comes home tom (at far as i know, i mean i havent talked to her since she left :p)  i really wish i could make these things more interesting i just realized most of you probally get really bored just reading the things i do in a list, i will try and make it better next time!  peace out and goodnight! everybody stay safe!
