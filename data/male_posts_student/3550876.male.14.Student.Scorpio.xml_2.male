The let-down is all around the park, whether its to do with the grass, or the tennis courts, For example, almost everywhere in longleat there are signs displaying " don't walk on Grass" and on the tennis courts there was a sign reading "Do not play Tennis". Okay, I understand why they would not like you to walk on grass, but what did we walk on before the invention of concrete and tar mac? Grass was made to walk on, it was gods intention. Also, what is the point of having a tennis court if there is no tennis to be played on it?. If you go to a place like that then you expect to have fun, and you do, but worrying about " Am I allowed to go down there?" or " Am I allowed to do this?". What are your opinions on 'signs' like this? As always, all opinions appreciated.  p.s Apologies on the fact that this is nothing to do with China :-)
