I will dispute that by saying, not really true.  Recent research has shown that cognitive development in teenagers is both non-standard and not as far along as we would suspect. The ability to use logic and critical thinking in the way that adults percieve it on average doesn't develop till 16 - 18 yrs. of age. It can develop in children as early as 12 - 14 yrs., or as late as 20 - 22 yrs of age. So, saying that they should be able to make up their own mind is somewhat true, but they are much more likely to be heavily influenced by outside forces rather than being able to weigh the pros and cons on their own.  Other signs that teens are not capable of the type of reasoned thinking adults are capable of: It has also been shown that teens do not accurately recognize facial expressions and the emotions they represent. They regularly interpret "shock" and "surprise" as "anger." The also had difficulty recognizing "anger," "confusion," and "empathy" and associating them with their propper emotions.  The teenage brain is still very much in flux and has not developed the stability and abilities of an adult brain till (on average) near the end of high school or the beginning of college. I find it interesting that so many people assume that a teenager (especially a high schooler) should be able to "think for themselves" - they can, but they are most likely using very flawed logical processes to come to conclusions.   So, when we're talking about objections to people endoctrinating our children, and believe me, I know it goes on for all aspects of the political spectrum, I am speaking of it as a trend that should be recognized in all areas and worked to be minimized if possible.
