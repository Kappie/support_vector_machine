I also have an interview with a staffing agency on Monday morning.   I feel pretty up and down today.  I am going to see Karate tonight and hopefully pick up the new Jets to Brazil CD. I downloaded a couple of mp3's from Jadetree and it's HOTTT.  Tomorrow mimi is off so we are going to the Russian River to watch the salmon swim up stream. That should be nice. I guess I will continue to search for a job where I can find my place again. Fuck, I can't wait to start school.   current mood: up and down current music: death cab for cutie
