Alright, now that I've had my little spaz for the day, I can go on with the rest of my blog.  Alright, so...I'm a little scared because I'm a starting to like rap....seriously...I'm not a rap person, but for sum reason I've started listening to it and liking it.....WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME!!!!  Well, I learned yesterday that Tina's going to try and and work on the whole hating me thing, which is rather kool, but really, that email left me more confused than it helped me.  How I went from rap to Tina I have no klue. Bye Kitty!  Sorry, my cat just jumped off the computer table, and i had to type good0bye to it.  Wow, see, I AM lame....it's fun though...I really have no clue what to talk about today...today was kinda....BLAH!!  I learned who my last teammate was in the ML game, and the person was right under my nose the whole time, it was rather dissappointing.  Hm...I have no klue what to talk about..so....I'm just gonna go......Peace!  Spense  P.S. I'm bored, talk to me people!
