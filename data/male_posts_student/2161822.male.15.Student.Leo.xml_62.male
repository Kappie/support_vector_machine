You just don't know what to say. Fear of what would happen if the words do escape your mouth. And the ironic security of keeping those forbidden words stuck in your teeth. This past 2 weeks have been like this. Nothing I can do about it. But I do have my music. See, everyone should learn how to play an instrument. When everything else sucks, you can turn the power on and let go of everything. I can't keep this blog totally negative. So on better news, I'd like to tell everyone to get the Chevelle DVD. I know it's a little late to be saying this, but it is awesome. So basically all I've been doing is putting the DVD on, blasting it through my stereo and playing along. Makes it feel like I'm still in a band. Anyone that can play an instrument decently, contact me. Immediately. That means you Ryan as soon as you get good. You too Eidleman.  Listen to H.I.M.
