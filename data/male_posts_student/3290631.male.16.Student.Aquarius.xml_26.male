I'd love to be a lifeguard because everyone tells me it's an awesome experience, and it pays 10 dollars an hour. (I piss my pants every time I say that) During the first 45 minutes, I was a wreck--nauseous, dizzy, cramps, sore, and feeling sorry for myself.  Then I got back into the water after a rest and started perfecting my technique.  I've been trying to become a smart swimmer, it's all about your technique and condition.  So after I got used to the swimming and the feel of it all, I was doing laps and all.  So, in short, passing the lifeguard test is a longshot, but I may pass it.  I'll have to see how I progress in the coming weeks.  I'm not counting on it though, which is why I'm securing my back-up job with Summer Youth tomorrow.  It pays less, a lot less, but what are you gonna do?  I'm going to take my diagnostic test tomorrow right when I get home from school, then head on down to the pool.
