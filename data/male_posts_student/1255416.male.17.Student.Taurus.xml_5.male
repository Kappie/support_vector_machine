So what's hapenned in the last six months of my life...hmm...  Well, I've pretty much reorganized all my friendships, i.e. I hang out predominately with two guys i know named Matt and Jay and play computer games over at Matt's house or charlie's house.  I know, exciting.  I mean, it can be nice, it can be fun, it can be entertaining, but the whole thing is just so fucking shallow.  I guess nearly all friendships are shallow, I've had very few that aren't.  Not to say the peopel are shallow, Matt, jay, Charlie, Derek, Mac, they're all great people who i enjoy being around, but i dunno, playing a game that takes extremely little rational thought for 4 hours straight can get a tad boring.  MAybe i just need more substance in my life.  Ap chem is taking up assloads of time.  That's right, assloads, literally.  It hurts to think how much stuff we'll have to knwo by the end of the year, by heart, and how badly we're being taught it.  That doesn't make any sense outside of context, let me explain.  We started the year with Ms. ANdrew, a really great person and an excellent teacher.  She was funny, she was extremely smart, and she made a possibly horribly boring subject into sometyihng that amde sense to me, that was fun.  She was pregnant the entire year, though, and when she had her baby in february suddenly we were being taught by a video.  Yes, you heard that right, a god damn VHS tape put out by CU denver.  It fucking sucks.  No one understands the material at all, the average on the last test was a D+ and the sad thign is I'mt aking an AP test over all thsi shit later this year....and i'm not going to do all that well because the materail was  so  poorly covered.  It freaking hurts.  CX is also taking up my life, though to a much lesser extent lately.  Debate is great, I love it, it allows me to crush the minds of lesser mortals, and what the hell coud be better than that?  Hell, i'm even going to Whitamn over the summer for two weeks of debate camp!  It'll be fucking great, I'LL KNOW HOW TO RUN A GOD DAMNED KRITIK!!!  I love it.  Love life, on the other hand has been rotting in a pit for, i'm pretty sure, more than a year.  Havne't kept track.  It kinda sucks, but oh well, you win some and you lose some and thngs'll turn around eventually, hell, i'm interested in a couple girls right now.... though i'll probably chicken out, sadly enough.  Well, that's 500 words, so I guess i'll leave you now, prolly post on thsi again now that there's a chance of people, you know, actually reading it.
