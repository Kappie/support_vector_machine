Anyway I was thinking about the different friends and associates I have, and I am really lucky....I am almost always surrounded by positive people with alot to offer society....  I have within my close circle of friends:   several excellent, pulitzer caliber writers....gifted web designers....experts on dealing with people on personal levels....people on the fast track to business success....people with compassion rarely seen in the 2002 human being....people with gifted comedic talents....  My friends are some of the most thoughtful, thought-provoking, awe-inspiring people on the planet....  I have friends who have given me their last quarters without question....driven completely out of the way to make sure that I was a part of the action....made room for me when there was no room....broken the rules to get me into places....been an ear to listen to my often frivalous complaints....dealt with my assholish tendencies....dealt with people they couldn't stand because they were cool with me.....brought me food when I was hungry....taken me in when I had no place to go in a new city....  My friends have accepted me for who I am.....sometimes selfish, sometimes giving....sometimes joyful, sometimes melancholy....I have more mood swings than a heterosexual 23 year old Black man should....and I lash out at the people I love the most at times....and yet my friends are still there for me....  I don't know why I've been on this friendship kick so much lately....most of them won't even get a chance to read this...but I want my friends to know that my lack of vocalization doesn't translate to a lack of appreciation....  Thank God for friends....
