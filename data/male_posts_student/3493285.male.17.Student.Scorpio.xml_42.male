Dear Megan, Do you know what i mean by the symbolism in my posts? if you did that would be ....really neat!  do you know what this summer needs more of. BBQ's. yes it does. i would offer to have one at my house, but we are landscaping/redoing (what is the word?) our backyard. however i would willingly supply and cook and whatever for a BBQ if someone would so kindly lend their backyard. we can have corn on the cob! and have a big waterfight (another summer thing). and then stay up all night. and laugh a lot. and watch se7ven. because jennifer lenny and elizabeth havent seen it. BBQ! BBQ!   i am now going to go listen/read "one flew over the cuckoo's nest" for IB. i am pulsating invigeratingly with excitement.  Dear ______, i hope you know that the way you are is awesome. you light up the room. people are drawn to you. everybody laugh's when you're around. everybody smiles when you're around. you have away of making somebody feel like they matter. your intensity is unique, and though you may see it as a flaw, it really makes youeven more special. dont be afraid to speak your mind, your opinionis valid, and it is who you are. learn to be comfortablewithwho you are. love yourself.you are an awesome person and i cant get enough of you.oh how would ms denny would hate me: never change, stay sweet!   -neil
