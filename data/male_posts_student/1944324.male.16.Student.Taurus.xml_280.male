Props to so and so. its actually kind of stupid and I never wat to hear it said again. Unless the speaker is refering to actual props for a play or something.   Ok, Michael, Im going to read the Alias recaps for the episodes I mised on TWoP.  Also, I'm going to ignore the squabble because I wasn't here. Also because I have divine right as administrator.  And because I think squabble is a dumb word.  reminds me of bad seafood. and notice the sentence fragments? good device. will be used more later  I know from sparrows to starlings. After that, everything's a duck, as far as I'm concerned.
