But she has replaced Natalie Portman as my favorite actress. The favorite actor still goes either to Johnny Depp or Orlando Bloom.  Currently talking to Manda, Amber's cousin. I think Manda is cute and lovely and sweet. By the way, Amber moved across the fucking state last night. This is bullshit. We're on the edge of her goddamn senior year. Ladies, we're having a senior party in Nashville when we turn 18. At a hotel. In the hot tub. Mocking our parents.  About to watch  once upon a time in mexico . Depp depp depp depp...  Gone folks.
