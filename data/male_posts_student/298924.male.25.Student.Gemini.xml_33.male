In other news....I have switched lab tables....my new lab partner has likened it to a mid season trade in the NBA....he says I should average a solid 10 ppg. and 6 rpg. and I'm a solid addition to the team....I love it over there although I am kind of hurt by the new name my former lab partner has given me...."Benedict Cal".....I suppose it is better than "Batter Daddy" though....  I am officially a  urlLink Kelly  groupie....I read her blog every single day without fail....my routine is now to check my e-mail and then go directly to her site....do not pass go....do not collect $200....she is so real....she reminds me of my sisters along with a dash of my roommate....  Well let me get some studying done cuz this weekend I'm going to be in the MIX....
