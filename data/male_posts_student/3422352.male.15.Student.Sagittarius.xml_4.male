I'm so high :) "on what?" I hear you ask. I'm high on life, that's what!!! I don't want anything to change. I love the world and everything and everyone. I LOVE EVERYTHING!!!!  Today I watched the best film in history ever to be made ever ever: 'The Crow' starring Brandon Lee (Bruce Lee's son). Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) is a guitarist for a band (Hangman's Joke) who has fallen in love. He and his partner Shelley are soon to be married, when they are both brutally murdered (Eric thrown out of a window, six storeys high and his girlfriend beaten and raped). Eric dies instantly, while Shelley holds on in hospital for another 30 hours before giving it up.  The two were very in love, though. The love between them is enough to bring Eric back to the 'material' world as an indestructable being. His lifeforce is bound to that of a crow (A symbol of death). He comes back to avenge the death of Shelley, by killing the people who raped and killed her. Only then can he rest peacefully.  Don't want to spoil it, though. I advise anyone to see it, rent it or whatever.
