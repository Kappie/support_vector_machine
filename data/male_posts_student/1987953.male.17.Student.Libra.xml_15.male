That does not change the intensity of my faith and my passionate love for God. By the way, please do not be a coward and not sign your comment. That makes what you have to say really unimportant, because obviously you don't have the guts to stand behind your comment, thus making it so invalid you don't understand.  Let me, like Mark, politely ask: Who the heck are you man? Why can you not believe in the divinity of Christ? How can you disprove it? We live by faith, not by sight. (2 Corinthians 5:7 NIV) Frankly, man, you seem really psycho the way you are going about this.  Second, please comment.... I got one comment. A comment would be so nice sometimes. Maybe I need to find some ways to publicize my page. Any ideas? Let me know. Blog ya later!   In Christ,  Mike  "We live by faith, not by sight. " -2 Corinthians 5:7 NIV  Today's Quote:  Welcome Home by Shaun Groves from Invitation to Eavesdrop  Take, me, make me All You want me to be That's all I'm asking, all I'm asking  Welcome to this heart of mine I've buried under prideful vines Grown to hide the mess I've made  Inside of me Come decorate, Lord  Open up the creaking door And walk upon the dusty floor Scrape away the guilty stains Until no sin or shame remain  Spread Your love upon the walls And occupy the empty halls Until the man I am has faded No more doors are barricaded  Chorus: Come inside this heart of mine It's not my own Make it home Come and take this heart and make it All Your own Welcome home  Take a seat, pull up a chair Forgive me for the disrepair And the souvenirs from floor to ceiling Gathered on my search for meaning  Every closet's filled with clutter Messes yet to be discovered I'm overwhelmed, I understand I can't make this place all that You can  repeat chorus  I took the space that You placed in me Redecorated in shades of greed And I made sure every door stayed locked Every window blocked, and still You knocked  repeat chorus
