I'd give this song about 4 stars out of 5  I am dead serious there is a drink called   McSars.  I can imagine the marketing,  "what about McEboli" "Hmm that won't work too European... what about McFleshEatingVirus" "ah thats too long" "Hey guys I know McSars its life threatening AND infectious" "Run with it!"
