"Bin Laden is said to have requested space to establish training camps, as well as assistance in procuring weapons, but Iraq apparently never responded," the report said. "There have been reports that contacts between Iraq and al-Qaida also occurred" after bin Laden moved his operations to Afghanistan in 1996, "but they do not appear to have resulted in a collaborative relationship," it said.  "Two senior bin Laden associates have adamantly denied that any ties existed between al-Qaida and Iraq," the report said.       Drudge, who is a massive tool, finds Dan Rather giving Clinton new book five stars far more shocking, locating the 911 commission blurb off to the side.  Of course, seeing how Drudge's readership is 87% Clinton-Hating-Conservatives (okay, I made that statistic up) his headline priorities are legitimate.  Honestly, this all leads me to believe that the only way the Bush apparatchiks would question Dear Leader's actions was if Bush pulled Clinton up on stage and started to make out with him.  What does Bush have to do to lose their vote?
