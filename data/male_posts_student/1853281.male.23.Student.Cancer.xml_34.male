Sudafed is my old friend in this situation but it has a tendancy to make my scalp itch. chatted with this girl from class about bands for like ten minutes today, she was a the longwave show on friday. maybe i am not so hopeless at the whole social interaction thing afterall, or maybe i am finally learning some social skills anywho gotta run. Time to study cheers
