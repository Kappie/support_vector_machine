I don't have a very good reason for being gone for so long, except that I have been going to school during the day and spending all of my free time trying to make a website.   Anyway, my class has been going smoothly, and I only have a little over a week left. So far, the work load has been light and simple, so the remaining time should go by fast. Today we watched "The Day Reagan Was Shot," an example of the kind of work we have been doing. The teacher of the class seems to be another anti-Bush advocate, but luckily she hasn't forced much of her opinion on the class.  As for my attempts to make a website, I have made progress in the past few days, but I still need my brother to help me with parts of the style sheet. The only problem is that he works at night, sleeps most of the day, and he is leaving for school next month. It would be a miracle if he had time to help me.  I guess after I am finished with my class I should probably get a job and complete some community service work for National Honor Society. As I have previously mentioned, I also want to make a visit to the University of Missouri-Columbia this summer. I don't know about taking a vacation. I heard a commercial on the radio this morning for Kansas tourism in which Bob Dole appointed himself Secretary of Fun and advocated taking a road trip across Kansas. Anyway...  I'm hungry. Let's get a taco.
