I am still working on my big  Best of the Best  blog because the txt file that is the list is on my brother's computer, and he doesn't live at home anymore so i really only get the chance to work on it when i go and see him. but all that will change once i get my laptop, that will be sweet indeed. suprising enough, i've run out of useless crap to say.
