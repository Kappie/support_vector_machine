I have gotten a very dark tan and I (unfortunatly) haven't lost any weight.  I just wanted to say that when I say band is hard you do not want to underestimate the hardness that band is. A ton of people underestimate marching band and it a lot harder than people think it is.  you have to march around just as much as you have to run around in foot ball and marching is harder than walking.  And you have to play music while you march around witch deprives you from enough oxygen and makes you lose your breath.  So whoever said that football was harder was absolutely wrong.  I wanna see you try memorize music and then play it while you are marching.  And also just to tell you guys that if you read this and put a comment on it then please sign your name at the end so that I can know whoever commented on it.  Thanks!                                                                                                   I'll write later,                                                                                                                       Mathew Thompson
