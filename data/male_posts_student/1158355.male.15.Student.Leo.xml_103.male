I had to deal with going to my aunt's fiancee's parent's house. Boring as hell so I hung out with my dad. Then I went to my cousins... what a relief. Then again, it wasn't that good either. Katie was all dissapointed because someone died on that date that she knew. It was 8 years ago today, but I think she shouldn't dwell on the past. There's no reason to, live happy for the future. Britt also fought with Katie and the little baby shits were following me around. Especially John John, when I hid in Katie's room to cheer up her and Keeri (don't know how to spell), by popping out of the bed when she told everyone to leave... JOHN JOHN TOLD THEM I WAS HIDING AFTER I TOLD HIM NOT TO!!! So I suffocated the 4 year old. The pool was fun though, especially going under water with goggles while holding a water gun shooting at your cousin heading straight for you, pretending your in the matrix...hehe. Alright now I have to go to bed and pretend to enjoy the worst day ever... tomorrow. My aunt's wedding...it's the same day of the best party of the year. My parent's friend's house upstate, I sware to god it's the best party ever, there's girls, contests, fun.... and a shit load of fun, and girls... and hot girls. AND WE CAN'T GO!!!!! )= Ah wtf, I'll make the best of tomorrow's party concidering IM GOING TO BE THE ONLY ONE THERE MY AGE!!! Everyone is either babies, children or adults.   Oh, getting your father drunk is great, he claimed he layed at 17 year old girl he didn't even know when he was 14. Haha, damn health people didn't find out about STD's yet!!!
