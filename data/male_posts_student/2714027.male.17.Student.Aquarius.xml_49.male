I've probably got more than usual because of the bank holiday (double time) I worked. I paid that and some other money into my gap year/Poland savings account, which now has over £1000 in it - awesome. The 4% interest on that account should really start to make a difference now. Anyway...  I got up at the right time this morning - 8.30am - which meant that I actually did some revision before lunch. Today's Physics revision day, and I managed to do a few hours of it this afternoon as well. It was fairly dull, but it had to be done. The pressure's creeping in now; I only have one more week before all hell break loose with all my remaining exams in quick succession. Scary.  During a break from revision, I went outside with our 5 year old digital camera and took a couple of pictures of random stuff that caught my eye. They're fairly random I know, but there you go. Clcik on the pictures to see them in detail and to view my other work. I can't wait to get my new camera and go off to photograph stuff.    urlLink      urlLink      I watched a video of a program I recorded last night called  One Day of War  by the BBC. It followed a day in the life of sixteen people from around the world who were all involved in war. It covered the wars we all know about and those we've never heard of. There was a soldier in Iraq with all the latest military hardware, then there were rebels in Nepal who were using 18th century flintlock muskets. It really struck me how lucky I was, to live somewhere where people aren't shooting at you or bombing the crap out of you, where you can get running water and all the other things we take for granted. Very thought provoking. On a similar subject, take a look at this awesome picture of an American soldier in Iraq that I found at  urlLink deviantART :       On a less serious note, it's  Big Brother  launch night and I'll be up watching and then off buying shares in all the contestants on  urlLink Celebdaq , as they're bound to appear in the crappier paper and thus their shares prices will rocket, earning me lots of virtual money.  I've recently realised just how close the Euro 2004 football tournament is; it starts on the 12th of June; about a couple of weeks time. England have got a tough initial group, but they should be able to pull through to the next round. Then again, I never get my hopes too high because it's been so long since we've one. I just hope France are knocked out as specacularly as they were in the World Cup. EA's  Euro 2004  game is so cynical it's ridiculous. They don't include any international tournaments in  FIFA 2004 , then release a game for the tournament that just has a few new modes. All the gullible 11 year olds go out and buy it, then shelf it as soon as it's all over. Definitely a well spent £40 that is.  Anyway, I've got to go and find some excuse to end this blog entry now, so see you next time!
