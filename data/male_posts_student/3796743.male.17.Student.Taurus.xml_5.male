My mom was on the phone at 8 am to this professor guy from this college service that we paid a few years ago to help me get into college and get some $$$ to go with that. He basically said I was doing pretty much everything right, and I was pretty much on track. She has another phone call scheduled for next week so we can go over financing, so I can get some financial aid! Cause I poor and I can't afford college! Anyways he also told my mom that I need to get my SAT scores up. I got a 1270 last time, and they said I need a 1400 to be able to get some decent money. But he did say with my score that I could get into just about any college, the only thing now is the money. He also said my 29 on the ACT was pretty good! So I'm excited, but I have to schedule myself to take the SAT two more times. I'm super excited about that one. I was supposed to take it with Alex, but I'm not gonna wait forever to schedule this one so I'll do it myself. Like last time! Anyways, heres the super un good thing this guy told my mom. That my last name (refer to previous post) should be left as is until I get into a college, where I can easily change it then. I mean it makes sense, but heres whats not cool. Everything I have (my SAT, ACT, and school transcripts) are under my preferred name. So next year I get to be someone else, and graduate as someone else. I'm not excited about this, but maybe my mom can force Ms. Tocar to do things my way. Transcrips in legal name, all other (ie. yearbook, graduation) in preferred name. We'll see, but I'm not too excited. My mom is still gonna talk to the lawyer about it too when she sees her next week. Whatever, I don't care anymore. It's dumb.   Well, today after much arguing over all that crap up there ^^^ I went to Costco and stuff with my mom and sister. We had lunch at the Olive Garden, and now I'm home alone doing nothing. I'm bored, but whatever, I don't care anymore. I also didn't call anybody today, as promised. Two people called me and I talked to them, but whatever. Alex called to say she got a job at Quizno's, and got kinda pissed when I wasn't too happy for her. I guess its just this, cause I don't need to work, I don't understand other people working. Like it wastes all your social time, and I dunno to me the money that you would earn (very little) isn't worth it. But to some people it is. Anyways, I guess its cool that she finally got a job, but whatever...we won't be seeing too much of each other after Monday, when she starts her job. Also, Morgan called me today. We heart Morgan. She's my hero, and had never pissed me off...so that takes a lot. I can't wait to go visit her in San Francisco next week. Emmy and I will have so much fun. So she called and we talked about flights, and what we wanna do while we're there....so that will be cool. It'll be good to get a vacation from all things Washington. I'm tired of it....I never really hated it here except in sixth grade when I got here, but I'm starting to want to go back home again. I want to move back to Cali, or somewhere else. I don't care. Somewhere, I need change, I crave change.   Oh yeah, and within seven days I need to pick out 8-10 colleges that I'm interested in for that college service thing. I have like two....yikes! Any suggestions? I'm having caffeine withdrawls, I've only had one iced grande caramel macchiato today....! I'm also really enjoying this 98 degree weather, and my highly air conditioned house. I don't know how people live without it. Well, my mom just got home, I wonder where I'm going for dinner? I don't know. I'll talk with you all later. Good night.
