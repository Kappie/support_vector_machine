James kept on mumbling "I hate Becky Ross, she's too intelligent" mwahaha.  That's what you get for sp00king someone with brains James :D   Hehe Becky ;)  Jamie might be hosting a sleepover this weekend so that should be good if it happens!  We could go out into the early hours of the morning and listen to the silence of the minute amount of cars on the motorway, and maybe see some stars if it's not cloudy!  I think I've pulled my tummy muscles :(  It hurts when I sit crooked, so I best not sit crooked lol.  G'dnight!  Mmm turkish delight!.. sorry, Auntie Paulines Easter gift is being devoured before me eyes!
