I found Audriana, her sister, her cousin, her mom, her father, kevin, amanda, randy, and quenia all in one ride at the same time and trust me this was not planned or even expected. but it was good. Now time for my ride review!   Superman    Time waiting: 1 hr and a 1/2     Fun:4/5  Fast:5/5 Puke Factor:3/5 (the lower the better) Coftablity: -2/5 (and why you ack I got a cramp and it hurt really bad) Notes : Good and fun hate the lines    Scream Machine   Time waiting: 1/2 hour  Fun:3/5 Fast:3/5 Puke Factor:1/5 Coftablity:3/5 Notes: It's allright but really I won't go on it twice...   Nitro   Time Wating: 40 minutes (we had fast passes by now)  Fun:5/5 Fast:5/5 Puke Factor:1/5 Coftablity:4/5 Notes: This one is the best ride and trust me we went back for more! It's really good I mean  good.  Best ride ever.   Skull Mountian   Time Waiting: 7 minutes (This was a fast pass thing)  Fun:4/5 Fast:4/5 Puke Factor:2/5 Coftablity:2/5 Notes: besides the fact that this ride is just dark and that I had to run from nitro to get there it was alright   Batman the ride   Time waiting: 55 minutes  Fun:3/5 Fast:5/5 Puke Factor:4/5 Coftablity:2/5 Notes: I got a horrible headache after this ride it's alright just let this one go and try chiller.
