Today while browsing the new releases on the iTunes Music Store I came across Ryan Cabrera's first wide-release single. The Dallas, Texas singer/songwriter is, I find, quite enjoyable to listen to. Some artists just have that style and voice that you can just play in the background and get caught up on it. It probably doesn't help that he's cute, too. Anyways go check him out and look for his Atlantic Records debut sometime this summer.
