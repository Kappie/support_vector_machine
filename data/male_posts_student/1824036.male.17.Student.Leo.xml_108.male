Not like I didn't have one...its just that I like to read different versions of the Bible to get the whole story....so...you do the math  Anyways, our creepy media center lady person, Mrs. "K" showed me where I could get one....then I asked, "Can I check one out?" Then she replied with the most degrating remark ever to come out of someone mouth intended to hurt me... she said, "Well of course...with as much as you need it, how could I say no?"  I about went nuts... I was going to make some reference to the amount of drug dealer dirt balls in my school....but didn't want any of them to over hear, then shoot me in the parkin lot after school...  Story of my life...never getting respect....
