I don't mean like God and people (He probably is enjoying a nice game of chess (deliberately close to WarGames)), I mean Stanners, Marx, Joe and Buzz. I'm not playing because I'm not that interested. It's not that I don't think the game is fun (which, from experience, I can say that it is), it's more that I'd prefer to be down here writing these words into this blog. So nyah, nyah, nyah, soo-dah, now we can tickle racoons.  Chris doesn't believe me that Laura is gorgeous, so I intend to send him the pic of her in which I pretty much swooned off my chair. Scott, who is a little less straight than the majority of straight people, was convinced straight off that she was (the wording is irrelevant and, for me, likely to cause some dispute/me getting twatted if stated). But yeah, diddle dee. Oh, Lawa, to let you know, I got your text at the WCB rehearsal, during a piece we've started called "Laura". I almost died.  Thinking of WCB I kinda wanna quit. I don't have a great deal of time and for me it's just not fun at all anymore. I'm playing an instrument (the baritone) that, although it has its charms, is not by any stretch of the musician's imagination a trombone. And it's that which is its major downfall.  I've managed to skimp a little on the revision. IE. I've done pretty much none. The word I'm looking for is  probably  'whoops', but stronger ones could come into effect.  Oh, and I don't care, in about 70 posts I am going to have a "300th post" party when it comes. I would have it for all the people who have a constant blog but there are a few reasons I wouldn't do that (all involving mixing certain people with Marx, because I'm a git like that and don't want things to get too complicated). Actually, if I can post just over 70 times in the next 22 days I could tie it in with Bill Bailey... that'd take a fair bit of work though...  Long, long post. I'll talk to you all later. Unless I don't actually talk to you. Which seems unlikely, most of the people who read my blog who I don't talk to only exist in my head.  Quote of the day: "Don't tell me it's not worth trying for, You can't tell me it's not worth dying for, You know it's true, Everything I do... I do it for you."
