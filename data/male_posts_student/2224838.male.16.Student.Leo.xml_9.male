Although many people are already passing it off as a disappointment, just as they did with  urlLink  Reloaded  , I still enjoyed many aspects of  Revolutions . While  urlLink  The Matrix   is undoubtedly the best of the trilogy--mostly because it introduced the story without the complications of the sequels--this movie successfully concluded the trilogy. In a basic sense, it was a good movie, and people who have followed the first two will want to see it.
