I just finished it as I type this, and added more versatility too. It now has a configuration program that comes along with it to set the network paths it should look at and it also now counts the number of pictures sold per job on an original bracelet.   I'll test it out tomorrow when I work 10:30 - 7 down at 123 Smile.  Speaking of which, I need to burn a Guster CD for MaryJo...  Never seems like there are enough hours in a day.
