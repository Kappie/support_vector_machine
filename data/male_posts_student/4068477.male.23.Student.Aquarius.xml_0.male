Kind of pissed off today though. We were supposed to goto see Randy Rogers band tonight. I get on their website and notice that they aren't here tonight. Oh well. Im listening to a song right now called "its hard to kiss the lips at night that chews your assout all day long" Thats funny right there, i dont care who u are. Randy is on right now, i guess that will do for tonight for missing the show. not really but thats what im going to go with. I really like this band more and more everytime i listen to them. Got a different sound to them. Went and saw them at some LITTLE bar in Galveston. Got to talk to them after the show so that was cool. Then we went to the beach after. Thats for a later post. Going home this weekend to see family. The mrs. is staying home to work, somebody has to pay for the trip. Just kidding. Ill admit it, she's the bread winner in the family. Ill try to get back on sometime sat. or sun. Untill then "Tonights not the night". TTTTM  T
