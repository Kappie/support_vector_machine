Are we not capable of doing it or we lack the guts to do so.When our people are in trouble, it is our duty to do what ever it takes. We have to do this if need arises. Already we cowed down once and had the ignonimity of a foreign minister escorting the militants to safety at Kandahar. We dont want something of that sort happening. Why Dont the govts in power evolve a policy to act upon such contingency. Its high time we got one. Now we just pray the almighty to settle matters and think time heals all wounds. But NO time doesnt heal all wounds especillay that of Self-Esteem
