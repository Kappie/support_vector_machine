I won't write all of it here, cause theres alot to share. There were, however, crazy old people that had no idea how to navigate to Chigago's O'hare airport. Good stories, and I missed out while riding in the other car. How sad. Hopefully, I can post some pictures of all if this good stuff sometime, hopefully in the "Pictures" section that I want to create. With my crafty idea of making this blog a webpage, I can do just that. We'll see.  Moving on to a slightly more phycological note, I ran across a commentary in my bible this past week that I thought would be good for sharing. It went something along the lines that society tells teen guys to absorb everything and not fellowship with others about feelings, problems, whatever, But that we should not pay attention to this because we are not created in the image of society, but in that of God. That makes a whole lot of sense, and frankly, makes me want to not be involved in society. Given that people make up society, I suppose thats not a living option. But avoiding societies trends....now thats thinking.  Well, thats just about all thats on my mind. Goodnight.
