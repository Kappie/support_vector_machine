I love this guy. I'm listening to him bash Bush to high heaven on Larry King right now. My favorite quote from him (when Bush was nominated at the Republican convention in 2000):   "The big elephant sitting in the corner is that George W. Bush is simply unqualified for the job... What's his accomplishment? That he's no longer an obnoxious drunk?"  HA! Oh man! That is just fantastic!
