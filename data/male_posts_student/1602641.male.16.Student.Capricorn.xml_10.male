Quentin Tarantino, the writer/director of such films as Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, at least in my book, is known for his incredible dialogue and plot twists.   Kill Bill, at least in my book, is known for it's incredible blood spurting effect, but don't get me wrong, blood spurting out of every orafice imaginable is great, but after an hour or so, it gets boring. It may be the fact that it is one half a plot, but this movie appeared to have no plot at all, just random killing.   Actually, what I meant to say is that the plot of "Revenge" is very weak in itself and needs something else to hold it up.   As for the spurting, did you know that you could bleed through your eyes?
