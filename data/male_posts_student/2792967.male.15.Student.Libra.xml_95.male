Really nice game, havent tried the multi-player yet though. Tonight, I took one more step into manhood....SHAVING! Well...I have shaved before, but I finally got my own electric razor, its all shiny and kewl. Other than that, nothing much going on here, just waiting for the DSL to come back. Post later.
