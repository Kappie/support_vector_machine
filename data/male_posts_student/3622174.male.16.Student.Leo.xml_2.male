However, the new skin still isn't the best it can be, and WinAmp is continuing the tradition of allowing you to skin your WinAmp player, and, boy, do some of these skins look good.  But, we'll get to that later.  Let's talk about the real features of WinAmp.  WinAmp is a music player for those people who don't like Windows Media.  It's both a music player and a video player, so you can have fun both ways.  The quality that comes with WinAmp far surpasses any media player I have ever used before (even more than jetAudio, which received a high recommendation from me last week), and it is definitely worth the download.   Several million users use WinAmp, due to its flexibility and customization.  You can change all sorts of stuff with the equalizer, and customize your skins, and everything.  It really makes a nice addition to an already powerful media player.  It's been around for many years now, and WinAmp keeps getting better.  The newest version, 5.1, is a masterpiece for anyone who listens to music.  You're going to get crystal clear quality with every song you listen to, and it supports many different formats.    urlLink    Winamp allows you to customize the look and feel by offering several downloadable skins on Winamp.com. urlLink     That picture up there is an example of how well customization goes, as far as the overall look of your player.  I downloaded that skin, which is called Resurgance, from the WinAmp website.  Yes, they really do have skins that are that good.  They far surpass the quality of the skins that you see on jetAudio or any other media player, and they work better too.  Every single one is flashy, and I don't think I've used one yet that I haven't liked, in the several years that I have had WinAmp on my computer.  If you feel like Broadcasting your own radio show, get on ShoutCast and set up your radio station, and give people the URL to your show.  You can broadcast right from WinAmp, and you can listen to it from WinAmp as well.  It's a nice little feature, but, I do think I like jetAudio's jetCast better than Shoutcast.  To me, it just seems like it works better.  If you're looking for a good media player, but, were not impressed with jetAudio, this is the one for you.  Later on today, bagel.tech's first ever war will go on, with jetAudio and WinAmp, to find out which is the better one.  So, be sure to check it out later, to see which one I truly think is better (and scores don't mean a thing).
