To try and put some things on the side bar 3. To use '()' instead of '[]' so much when doing brackets Of little consequence really, but this will be the last post of being in the style of Live Journal. Don't cry too much children.  Anyway; to the present, it's Sunday afternoon and I have nothing to do. Revision is always there, but that can be tiresome, I don't have a job, and haven't since I completed my work for  urlLink Hunter Seeds' website  and I haven't been able to buy myself a bass guitar yet.  A glance over today's 'world news stories' showed every one of them to be war-related. Seems that's all which is important today is war. Global Warming is of little consequence - in fact, it’s rather good if you’re Russia [warmer climate is better for their agriculture] and you don't really care if you’re America [because you ARE America and if it wasn't for them there would be a global depression]. Which I think is very thoughtful of the latter: economic depression soon or apocalypse later.
