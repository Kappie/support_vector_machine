He has gone wayward of late, but his lapsing into episodic drug taking, petty crime and spells in prison has probably added more publicity and mystique to the Libertines convoluted path to here and now. Standing upon the verge of the Libertine's second album and after the top ten success of 'For Lovers' with the Wolfman (I'm sorry but I just can't resist the tantalising prospect of a Prokofiev pun), it would seem to be an exciting time to be a Libertines fan, especially with the usually unhyperbolic Mick Jones (Producer-in-chief of the record) declaring that 'The Man who would be King' possesses "as good lyrics as anything I have ever seen". The only song I'm fully conversant with is 'What Katie Did', and I have to say it is drool-worthy. In th Indie discos that I frequent, everybody's (okay perhaps not literally everyone but you get the picture) favourite band is the Libertines. Yet Doherty's tumultuous ride on the back of the dragon that is Rock 'n' Roll is leading him dangerously close to a mortician's glove. Some of my friends believe that this man would be deified in the same way that Cobain was 10 years ago, if he were to go in the same way, such is the gravity surrounding the band of late. Yet I send out this plea, which will probably be never read by the man himself, to not choose the path of self-destruction, torment, tempest and ultimately and untimely and sorrowful death. Pete, everyone loves you irrespective of your excesses and for the person that you are, not for your bank balance or your celebrity. You have truly swept tides of joy into countless lives up and down the country and all over the world. Your music has brought people back from the edge, it has polarised misery to elation and brought warmth to my heart. You were probably too overwhelmed in a morass of drugs to remember when I met you, but I called you a genius and my word is irrevocable, I do not retract that now. I for one do not want to have you as a memory, immortalised in incessant airplay instead of being here with those who love you most, creating more great music in the most libertine of places, car parks, nuclear bunkers, book shops toilets and whatnot. It would desecrate you if you were canonised with Kurt Cobain, and the vulture-doubters would gather round and pick holes in your legacy. I believe your place is here, but this is all about liberty. All I, and others can do is plead for you to stay with us. Pick the positive path (ooh Sun-esque alliteration).  Mood: Stern and plaintive Music: Black Sabbath - Evil Woman; Bloc Party - Little Thoughts; The Libertines - What Katie Did.
