I need an outlet for life, so this should be a good home.  My [online] name is Nakor, and I go to Sir Sandford Fleming College in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada.  I am taking the 3 year Programmer Analyst course there.  I plan to spend the rest of my life when I'm done making video games.  I will get into the industry in anyway I can, and I will be making games throughout my time in school.  This site will likely also be used for posting updates on my projects...sorta like a .plan file.  I have already done some games in school, although they are silly tiny little things.  The only sizeable project I have done is actually a joke to annoy a student we [endearingly] call Little Bitch (or LB for short).  It is called "The Adventures of Little Bitch" and it's very silly.  It's not done yet because I really don't care to create the aprox 30 or so battles and monsters that it would take to finish it.  I will entice my fellow students to write some of the battles I think.  I am 24 years old now, and I spent approximately the last 5 years before I started school, trying to get into school.  Despite my disapointment at how easy school is (very very easy), I firmly believe SSFC (Fleming) is the greatest college for IT.  Despite some of my rather pathetic teachers (I'm not gonna say names), I have had some excellent experiences so far.  Dennis Vanderspek taught my Technical Communications course, and I must say he is very intelligent.  I was proud to learn from him (although he'd probably be annoyed with me if he read this...my online writting is different then my writting in his classes.)  Another teacher that impressed me a great deal is actually the head of the Programmer Analyst course, Lynn Allan.  While she may be so heavy on the D (DiSC) that it annoys me, she definately knows what she's talking about.  In the end, if you live anywhere near Peterborough and you are looking for a school, Fleming should be it.  If only I can stop trying to spell it with two m's I should be all right.  Well, that's it for now.  Gotta finish setting up the rest of the site.  Nakor
