A large (or rather staggeringly enormous) woman (or man I suppose) waddles in to the library, goes and finds some books. (Perhaps resting a few times on the way, sweating and panting disgustingly as they go). They finally make it back to the checkout desk and slam their books down exclaiming: "golly I'm tired..." or "whew I'm exhausted" or some such other statement. And what causes all this exhaustion you might ask? Simply walking across a small branch library...what is the world of obesity coming to...
