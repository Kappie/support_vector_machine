I was driving, so couldn't drink, and felt a little out of place which was a shame. Still, it was cool to see everyone for one last time and say goodbye. We've changed from a group of strangers to a group of friends, and I'll definitely want to meet up in the future with a few others from the company. I'll be an advisor to a company next year though, which should provide an interesting new perspective on the whole experience.  Thursday started as a normal day, with Maths and then a couple of free periods, but it all changed when all of the prefects were called into a little meeting. It turned out that the new first years were coming in that day and that we would spend the afternoon showing them round and answering their questions. It was interesting meeting the new guys and remembering that exact same event six years ago when we were that small and nervous. The contrast between us was striking; we're so near to the end of our stay at school, eager to get out into the real world, and they're just starting the journey, so eager to begin. Showing my little group of six round with another prefect was oddly satisfying, us passing on little 'unofficial' hints and tips, answering their questions on just about everything.  When I got home, my new digital camera was there waiting for me and proved to be excellent. The only setback was that all of the documentation was in French and my Dad found it Â£50 cheaper somewhere else. I had a play around with it, then regretfully packed it up and sent it back. Oh well, should get a new one in the next week or so.  Yesterday was a fairly average school day, and the last one in the first week that I've been driving on my own. I'm really getting used to it now and seem to be learning about real life road use fairly fast. White-van-men live up to their reputation, undertaking me through bus lanes twice in a day! I came home early and then went off to the dentist, which went well as usual.  In the evening I went out to a leavers' ball at a local pub/hotel/venue, which a friend and I had received invites from a girl at our Young Enterprise company. I really didn't know what to expect at all since I hadn't been to the place before, but when we got there it turned out to be a semi-posh, well organised place, with little signs like "smart dress only" and bouncers everywhere. Once we'd been checked off the invitee list and met up with our friend, we descendedd into what turned out to be a large main room, complete with tables, dancefloor and bar. When we got there, the party was already in full swing, full of people dancing and drinking. Going into any situation like that seems overwhelming for me to begin with because there's just so much stuff to take in.  Anyway, a little group of about four or five of us sat down and started chatting. When they all got up to dance, I was a little anxious because I usually avoid dancing at all costs because I think I'm crap at it. I didn't have much choice though, so got up and joined them anyway. As it happened, it wasn't as bad as I thought it might be and I happily joined in with everyone else, helped on by the ever useful aid of alcohol. I spend most of the evening, chatting and dancing with people and even surprised myself with how much I enjoyed it. Possibly the best thing is that it was a huge confidence booster, because I needn't be afraid of dancing anymore. I also met two people from my old schools, one from each, who I hadn't seen in about six years. It was pretty cool seeing how they had changed and hearing what they had to say, and provided a great talking point.  Today was spent at work, where the weather just couldn't decide what to do. It rained, then there was sun, then it rained again - on and off all day it was. I also had to ask my manager about the touchy subject of holiday, in that I wanted to take one day off for my Poland trip, but could work extra during the summer and will be willing to cancel some holiday next week. Hopefully he'll look kindly on my request because otherwise I'm, um, screwed.  Tomorrow will be spent simply lounging around, playing PES 3 and watching the Euro 2004 final. Well that's the plan anyway.
