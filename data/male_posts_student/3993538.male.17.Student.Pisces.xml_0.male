Or is it my fear, my anger, my hate.   Is it my kindness, my warmth, my honesty.   Or is it my guilt, my abuse, my jealousy.   Is it my beauty, my happiness, my smile.   Or is it colour, my ugliness, my style.   Is it my loyalty, my success, my intelligence.   Or is it my pass, my mistake, my resentment.   Is it my respect, my individuality, my gratitude.   Or is it my defense, my failure, my attitude.   Is it my sensitivity, my patience, my confidence.   Or is it my temper, my animosity, my ignorance.   Is it my dreams, my hopes, my fame.   Or is it my struggle, my despair, my shape.   When you look at me tell me, what do you see?
