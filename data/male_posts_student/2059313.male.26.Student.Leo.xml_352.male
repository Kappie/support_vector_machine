But somehow girls that I don't have ANY desire to get to know any better are the ones that seem to "throw themselves" at me.  Maybe it's a matter of the amount of energy you put into someone.  But I look at other relationships, and that seems to work on some girls but not on others.  I've tried different things.  And not to get down on myself, but the only thing I see differently between me and the guys that girls seem to go for is the looks.  I guess I just don't have "it"... whatever the heck "it" is.
