He's had his life handed to him by his parents, and no doubt while he loves them a lot of his frustrations are coming from a lack of direction.  He's been directed all his life and he struggles to be who he wants to be.  Because he's never worked for anything he doesn't understand the value of anything and throws away his extremely valuable education and life his well to do parents have given him.  He judges people and fails to make successful relationships because he's placed arbitrary value in some unimportant things.  However I feel Holden has a kind heart, and that counts for a lot.  He's simply, uninformed to say the worst, and is a bit odd.  For me, the character makes sense, and I do find the book extremely memorable, much more so than many other novels I've read.  I find the conciseness of the book commendable, Orwell's philosophy of saying what you need to say without the fluff is philosophy now too.
