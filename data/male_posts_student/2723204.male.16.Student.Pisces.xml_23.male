She's finally talking to me...........but hmmmm..........ok, i've got a geog test tmr, and tons of homework to complete, tuition included, so the mood for today........is STRESS !!!!!!!! ok....i think i better get a grip on myself........its really poor time management sometimes, but sometimes is maybe i rely too much on inspiration to get my homework done..........:p . I think i gotta change that, cos' homework is stifling and this whole cirriculum is too science-orientated instead of arts-orientated, and where the heck are subjects such as philosophy and social sciences in our cirriculum?????? No where to be found !! i gotta go the Uni before i can learn them, its crap seriously............  Cos' science is the pursuit of constant principles in the face of a reality which is constantly-evolving. (alright, maybe i'll elaborate on that sometime, but it won't be that soon, cos' i still got feminism and God on the waiting list of essays.) The afore-mentioned statement is really a jab at absolutism. But yeah, another rant for another day...................  Ok, i think my blog needs a revamp seriously, but most templates i found on the net are either a reflection of this generic pop culture, or it inadequately, and inaccurately reflects my thoughts and character. So, unless you've got some good ones, you can leave it in the comments section...........but anyway busy on MSN, so this would be the end of today's entry............
