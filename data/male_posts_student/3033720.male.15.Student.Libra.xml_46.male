Besides, I know how to spell the word "character". Thanks for being a great friend, never lying to me, and  never  making a mockery of me. Like I said in a former post, class of '06, I hate most of you guys. I really need to pick and choose the few friends I have more wisely, don't I? Well, time to go take a bubble bath with candles, meditate, and listen to New Age music to get this off my mind. People suck.
