"If you have any questions, just talk to John, Maxi, Arugato, Steve-o, or Smeagol!" Yeah, seriously, some idiot at Oak Park High School has  Smeagol  for a nickname. What a cool guy. And another thing: I am convinced that at every high school, there is a super cool kid named Tripp. I have no bloody clue why. But there is.  People think that having an awesome nickname makes them special in some way, but it really just makes them look like total jerks. I have heard people trying to in invent their own little names. There is nothing worse than a self-imposed nickname.   Ah who am I kidding. I'm just jealous because nobody ever gave me one. If you are reading this, call me Scat from now on. I'm begging you.   ~Scat
