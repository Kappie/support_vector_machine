Isn't it interesting, how every life you look upon appears fairly simple and you tend to categorize it under a certain category of lives? At least I do anyway. It really takes a great deal of interest and caring for you to really see the depth of a person's life. Every one's is different, no matter how similar to another it appears at first. Well anyway, there's not much to write tonight. My friend came back from a place near Tahoe today... I missed her lots, and I was dumbf*ck bored without her around. I was so happy to see her today. ^^ I haven't talked to the one I'm so madly in love with since our not so happy, abrupt ending of a conversation yesterday. *sigh* I think I'm just going to go to bed now.... Maybe play some Simcity 4 for a while... Who knows... I like this font! w00t... Well anyway... Goodnight all! Goodnight Cricket! :)
