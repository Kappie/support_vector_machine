Oh yeah , pretty good story, why don’t you go back and tell it to your grandmothers dead WHEELCHAIR. That’s right I said it, and I’m angry. I’m angry at all these barfing bitches they call models. These bulimic bimbos spend their time trying on trendy shit and banging Hanson all the time. Bunn that. If it were up to me, they’d all be dangling into a pit of bitch eating jelly fish. I’m not trying to say that I don’t eat seahorses, heh I mean… who doesn’t? But seriously, where the hell were these models raised? Ethiopia? But it still doesn’t explain why their wedding dresses look like they were dug up from their great grandmothers grave. Like really. Then, THEN , they have the nerve to rape all three members of Hanson before me or Lindz have a chance at them. Well that’s the last straw, if I ever see a model, I will force feed them a big mac , or maybe I’ll just feed THEM to Dance Dance batman.  On another note, I just read this article in the messenger about William grants bully box. I talks about how OMLY  50% of the messages are pranks. Hold on while I hyperventilate. The opening line is what got me. “ William Grant checks one of LCCHS’ bully box for anonymous cries for help. He pulls out a chewed piece of gum. “  . Excuse me sir, but are you a fat fucking pig?  I also had a good idea of trying out for American Idol and spinning Simon around on his computer chair while singing a hilarious rendition of You Spin Me Right Round.  Then I realized we live in Canada eh and I got an even better idea. Since the host of the show’s name is Ben Melrooney, and I don’t KNOW that fat judges name, I’ll just do this.  Me: *dykes in* WHEN I WAS AYOUNG WART HOGGGGGGGGGGG! Fat Judge: That was the worst fucking thing I’ve ever heard. Me: Hey, HEY  MEL MELROONEY! SHUT YOUR PIE HOLE! Fat Judge: Uh miss? That’s not my…. Me: YA MEL MELROONEY, YOU FAT FUCKING SWINE! Fat Judge: That’s not my name… Or the host of  the show’s name. Me: STFU *ninja roll out* Oh by the way , Gary Benzo… if you’re out there… Brush your fucking teeth, before somebody else does it for you. Models; -33034834983   Gary; ew Me ; 4
