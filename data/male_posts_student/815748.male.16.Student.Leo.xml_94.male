I'm a little concerned that Loren hasn't been spending enough time with Melody in the last like month.  I spend more time with him, and I only see him an hour or maybe a little more(on Monday) a day and none on the weekends/Tuesday.  Loren seems to be telling me to "back off" and I'm like "SO STUPID!!!!" (Oliver on The OC).  1. Speaking of which,  Mme DeRobert wrote on a test on which I had mentioned "Le OC" "Qu'est-ce que c'est?" Seulement le meilleur programme en histoire de la monde!  2. Also speaking of which, I'm annoyed that Loren likes Oliver.  He's so evil and like antagonistic.  It's just like Othello, Oliver (Iago) keeps messing with Ryan's mind and Ryan (Othello except a little different) is the only one who knows the truth.  OK, maybe it isn't like Othello, but Oliver does mess with Ryan and Ryan is the only good one who acts on his morals, even if it is against the rules, to save Marissa.   3. Speaking of Marissa, I think that she is a bad match for Ryan.  She is really a better match with Oliver, because they are both so messed up in the head.  But that doesn't mean that Ryan wasn't right in trying to save her; he was still her boyfriend and recognized the evil machinations of that kook Oliver.  Also, did you know that the actress who plays Marissa, Mischa Barton, is only seventeen?  Too young.  4. As you read this, you may be listening to a new teen angst song.  Loren and I agreed to change both of our songs back to teen angst songs, even though Alicia Keys is cool.  Hear with enjoyment.  5. Loren should really stop making "your mom" jokes.  They're getting so old.  6. I'm getting a little better at speaking with this goshforsaken retainer, but I'm still going to take it off at the trial.  7. I FINALLY took the history test today that I was supposed to have taken on Wednesday.  Now I have just two tests, a quiz, and a trial in the week before I leave.  Woohoo (notice the period in lieu of an exclamation point).  Here are some quotes from history to end the ol' post-o-rooney:  "It's kind of a quick and dirty way to do it." --- Ms. Heidlage  "Christianity... it's a faith-based religion, there's nothing logical about it." --- Ms. Heidlage  "What were some of the internal problems?  Starvation, poverty, misery..." --- Ms Heidlage, and I'm like, yeah, the government really should have taken action to combat misery."
