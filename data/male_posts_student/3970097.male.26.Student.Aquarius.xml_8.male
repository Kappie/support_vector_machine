I remember the last time i saw her was in the Willeton Galleria, she was doing some shopping while i was catching up my coffee there. I saw Renee with a heavy load, confused as always so I decided to offer her some of my help. We have alot of good memories together. She was the first person in university to show me the student's office and from there on in, we became good friends. She told me today that she has finally got her dream guy and they have decided to get married in December this year. Congrats to her as it was hell tough for Renee to find a "suitable person" as she used to say. I dont know renee that i'd be able to participate in your wedding but as I promised to you on the phone, I'll do my best. After all we are the best buddies. She has a mysterious personality among our clique, the one of its kind whose eyes always roam around when we were either at cinema or dodging glances on a train. It was fun being with her. quiet amusing I must say. Aurihgt fellows, time for me to catch up with some drink now. But you know that you guys hafta come back to see if there's any update, eh? You bet there will be. Take care ye all and see ye all back in sydney. Wish me well
