I wrote a loooong post and it's not even done yet... Since it's not done yet, I couldn't post it, so I just saved it on the hard drive two days ago. It might take a while for that to come back.  I have 50(?) units to do in 59(?) days. I'm not sure... Emerson counted for me, it could either be 50 and 59 or 40 and 49. Most likely the latter. I'm not feeling well today... I'll try to put up that post ASAP.  -ArV
