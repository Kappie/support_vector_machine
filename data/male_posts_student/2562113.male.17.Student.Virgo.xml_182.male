I just got in from playing some frisbee in the field with Bob.....it feels nice to finally be able to go outside for reasons other than walking to class.  After a LONG wait we finally got our housing registration done. We went down to register this morning and waited in a miserable line for at least 2 hours. Word was going around that the only housing left for freshman was Alumni Quad (which is about 3 miles downtown). However, we were really lucky that we registered early because..........we were able to get a 6-person suite ( with its own bathroom ) on  STATE QUAD in Fulton Hall, Suite 306 . One of the last 6-person suites available on the uptown campus. If we wanted to stay on Colonial Quad we would have had to split up our suite and we would have had to share a bathroom with the rest of the hall (boooooooo). So I guess we REALLY lucked out as most of our friends are going to be stuck downtown on Alumni Quad next year.  Aight fellas. I'll see you all in a week in a half for Spring Break before I go to Florida!!!! And I'll see Darin and Reza when they come up this weekend!! Anyone else who wishes to come, speak up soon!!  -BIGsmut
