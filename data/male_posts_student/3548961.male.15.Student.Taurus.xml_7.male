Also i just asked for some new shoes and i was told that i wasn't really gonna get anything from them for a while. Yeah, that sucks cause i was banking on getting some new gloves and a new goalie jersey from them for manual season and now im not too sure.  Anyway, now to the happy stuff, im gonna get my cast off on wednesday morning so ofcourse im gonna play soccer that day. if you are one of my soccer friends, were gonna play, my schedul is gonna be full of soccer. im gonna have to train SOOO hard if i want to make manual. i have 4 weeks. so im even gonna be training when im in california. Incidently i have 8 hours left on the cleats auction and im still winning although some dude kept trying to outbid me and jacked my price up to 45 dollars but its ok, im still getting 140$ cleats for real cheap. I also learned kelme leather conditioner comes with it which i have been wanting, i need to condition my predators. well ok, thats my life thus far, not much else to say. love always -alex
