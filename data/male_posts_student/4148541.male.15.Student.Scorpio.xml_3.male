I at least got to try doom 3 and I made some friends with common interests. Everyone was exchanging porn and illegal movies. For legal reasons:I did not participate in any of this swapping.  Having dealt with the lawyers.....  Its good to have some friends now. I still just wanna get into my house.  I am trying to coax my dad into letting me get a camera.   I am wiped it 2 am and I didnt sleep 2 much last night Im beginning to pick up misc slang. And I am getting used to the accent...I hope I get the accent before I come to visit Hope something interesting happens tomorrow.  Peace
