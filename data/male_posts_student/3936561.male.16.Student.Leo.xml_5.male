In other news, I (once again) have a reason to watch the Sci-Fi channel, as their new series  Stargate: Atlantis  interests me. Oh, and I guess  Farscape  is coming back, so all is good. Later!   Postscript: I finished two interesting Sci-Fi novels, The Jesus Incident by Frank Herbert, and The Fountains of Paradise by Sir Arthur C. Clarke, both very fine works of literature. And we dropped my sister off at horse camp, so I've the house w/o her until Sunday. \/\/00+!
