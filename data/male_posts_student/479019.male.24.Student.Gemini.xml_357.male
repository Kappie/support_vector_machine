I know nothing beats fresh potatoes for making hashbrowns, but damn it frozen makes it so I don't have to spend an extra 15 minutes skinning and chopping potatoes in the morning. I need to pick up eggs on Friday.  I've also been playing alot with my Amazon  urlLink wish list . I've got a bunch of stuff in there now. I also have been rating stuff like crazy there too.  My plan for today is to go get the art history reading photocopied, and then finish the Berman reading. I'll probably take breaks and read some more of the C.L.R James book on the Haitian revolution too.  In terms of what Prof. Keyder was talking about yesterday on area papers... I'm pretty set on this whole modernism and post-modernism thing. Maybe something about cultural and knowledge flows and changes in epistemology during those time period on a world-historical level?  For my aural enjoyment right now is  Bad Religion 's "The Same Person" from their  No Substance  CD.  ***
