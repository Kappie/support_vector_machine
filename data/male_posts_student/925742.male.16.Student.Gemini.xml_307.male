I got some good stuff, I got lucky.  Then I went to Cara's house.  People were 'ravaging' and such.  Haha, oh well.  And Nightmare Before Christmas was the movie from 9 to 11.  Yeah, I missed the rocky horror picture show.  Eh.  But Kim showed up and even more talking began.  People (luckily I knew everyone there and everyone we were talking about) got into funny stuff.  Ah.... good times.  It was best at the end with her and I.  She's on my mind so much....  I can't help but smile....
