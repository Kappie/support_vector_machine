It's very difficult to impossible to have a computer measure a rotating sunspot's angular velocity, so it has to be done by hand. It takes a level of skill to measure sunspots, too. I suppose this is what interns (and, to a lesser extent, research assistants in universities) are for--doing tasks that are important, tedious, and impossible to automate.  I help maintain these web pages:  urlLink rotating sunspots ,   urlLink TRACE/MDI rotating sunspots list , and  urlLink TRACE health monitoring . I also did a  urlLink write-up . The online write-up is not complete, as I'm too lazy to translate the full write up from TeX (a text layout format) into HTML.
