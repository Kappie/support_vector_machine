She was wondering if i would continue to practice my piano if i stop my lessons. lolx~ haix..  The rest of the days same lah.  Was studying with weichong loh.  Had biology practical today. Played with the microscope. Ivan accidentally cut himself on the glass slide. Then we watched his red blood cells on the microscope. =P Was cool man. Real cool.  I met xiaoying for lunch later in the day. I practically ate all her pig's livers for her. -.-" Oh ya! I better write this down. XIAOYING WAS LATE FOR 1/2 HOUR! lolx.  i'm always so punctual..  After that, went for NDP rehearsal at shuqun. My Boys had difficults marching with the band's drum beats and the GB. Hhhmmm.. Howz?   Gonna do some hmwk. Adios peeps.
