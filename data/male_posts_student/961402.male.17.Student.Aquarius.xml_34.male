Happiness.  An hour of seesaw conversation on the phone is happy and depressing and confusing and ends up depressifying, so I mope. But better now.  Packing for Costa Rica almost done and driving arrangements for Sam's party done with the MC, fer shizzilous. That reminds me, I need to email him a clever Your Mom joke...one second...  There we go. Phone call...Yay! See that little blurb about the earlier conversation? It was depressing and is now all better. Life gets...let's see...four-and-a-half points.  Right, the point of this post that gives it a title. I can't think of any commentary that would make it any more amusing than it already is,  urlLink so just click , why don't you?
