Let's face it, if I wasn't bored, I wouldn't be doing this in the first place! That and having a stupid amount of free time, at least until my full uni timetable kicks in, are the main contributory factors to me bothering with this.  I'm a student, ok? Just started at the  urlLink University of Teesside , which for you international folks out there, is based in Middlesbrough, England. Not on another planet or anything, though with some of the people I've seen wandering around, I've seriously got to wonder where the HELL they came from - or which hell, for that matter. I'm studying for a HND in Computer Studies, biased towards Software Development, which means I get to play with computers a lot. Next year I'm hoping to move onto a degree in Games Programming, but whether that happens or not, I guess we'll all find out in approximately 12 months time. I know I can do it, it's just convincing myself it's worth the effort.  Think I'm starting to make a few friends, not too bad by my standards, it usually takes a lot longer than this. I suppose I'm helped by the fact that only a few of the others have been to uni in the past, so EVERYONE is trying to meet people and form friendships. Unfortunately for me, the people I'm meeting so far are all on different modules - but at least I can go and get pissed with them, should the opportunity present itself.... I'm confident that it will, we are meant to be students after all.....  As well as this site, I have another two. One is my personal site, which I haven't yet gotten much done with - that's located at  urlLink www.mrtufty.co.uk . And the other is a site I'm developing with my friends, to show the world how mad we are - that one is at  urlLink www.alltheusualsuspects.co.uk . Both are still very much under development, and are likely to stay that way for a very long time, or at least until I've achieved the correct balance between my personal life, work, and university. I never was much good at juggling....
