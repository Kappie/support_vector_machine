A bicycle. you need to paddle on both sides forit to get moving smoothly. if only one side is being paddled, the bicycle can hardly move. same for love. if only one person is making an effort and showing his/her love, it'll be hard to carry on.  So for those who are attatched. do not be afraid to express yourself to your significant other. dont give up, even though you are the only one paddling, try as hard as you can. dont loose balance and fall off. it'll be hard getting back up. continue to try, keep the bicycle moving, and very soon, the other paddle will follow.~  yes im looking at you daniel, jon,ryan and gangbang. kels uhh..ok not fair, so i think of one for kel. heres to you mate. you dont necessarily need to ride a bicycle. there are so many other means of transport. MRTS, cars, vans,  lolli cia ,aeroplanes, helicopters, cranes, motorcycles. but if you insist on riding bicycles, there aremanyother types too.two wheeled, three wheeled, four wheeled, with or withoutextension, headlights,different number of gears,different thickness of wheels,different brands, with hook ons, with waterbottle holder or without, withorwithoutbell, with a scratch mark or not...and yada yada i could go on forever.  and heres to everyone.   romance islikefried rice. you must add the charsiew la, the egg la, theonion la...and must fry and fry and fry.firecannot too hot. or else ah, your romance, sureburn one ah! chao ta!   im fuckinggay today eh?
