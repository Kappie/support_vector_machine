Secondly, slightly confused by Miller's remark on her blog regarding the asking her out thing I did on Monday. Miller, I would if I could, but that doesn't mean I can. You won't have the chance to be shocked. Sorry!  Thirdly, Patrick, your asking out thing will not match the splendour of what is mine, what is original. I feel mine is one of the greatest creations of all time. And I'm completely modest about it. Yes. Definitely.  Fourthly, I get worried about these tablets. I really feel they're going to do something awful to me.  Fifthly... I'll post a poetic quote later.  Love, Jon Roskilly
