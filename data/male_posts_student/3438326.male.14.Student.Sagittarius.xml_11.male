Patrick and Maya are both not at school, which is lame, because I always spend my lunchtime with at least one of them. Also my SATS results are there. In Maths I got an 8 which is good, and I don't wanna look at Science, because I'm gonna fail, I swear.  In true Patrick blogging fasion I'm gonna review a game. Patrick lent me Tony Hawks Underground, and its amasing with an 's'. The graphics are great, the tricks are amazingly animated, and the storyline is actually not bad, for a skating game. I love the soundtrack, its great after a lameass day at school. I made a character, who is amazing, really fasiony, but in a cool skater way. Woo.  Amy and Rachel and... pretty much everyone I know, except Yas, are keeping a secret from me. I'm going out of my mind trying to figure it out, or get them to tell me but to no avail. Oh well. Its the Big Brother eviction today, and I haven't given any thought as to who I want to go. I think I want Marco to go, because Nadia hasn't had all her drama yet, Michelles amazing, chi'en, and Marco Annoys me out of my mind. Seriously. Every time he opens his mouth I want to either shoot myself, or him. Its that bad.  I have decided I hate secrets. I hate keeping them, I hate them being kept from me. I love, however, knowing secrets. Knowledge is power... At the moment I'm keeping a load of secrets and I like some and others are big and scary. Lame...  Oo, Lots of blogging.
