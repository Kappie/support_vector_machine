Should be a fun time helping all the people that don't properly take care of their glasses; you know the ones with frame cheese that grey and greenish goo that gets trapped amongst the nosepads that us opticians get to clean out day in and day out.  How people can wear their glasses for hours on end with this crap just millimeters from their eyes I will never know.  Anywho, off to bed again to see what tomorrow brings... if anything maybe the new Jeep Liberty CRD I've been waiting for will be released!!!  This has been a small obsession of mine for quite some time.  I almost bought a jeep about a week ago just before vacation.  I have the perfect little badboy all setup, picked out and actually had a weekend test drive with it.  However, the dipstick of a salesman tried to pull a fast one on us and we dropped the whole thing like one of the kids at the pool.  We've decided to wait a couple of months to pay off a little more debt and see what the 05's have to bring.  Rob
