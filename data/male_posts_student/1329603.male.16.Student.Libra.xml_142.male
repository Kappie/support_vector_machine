Sure, it's an opportunity for companies to sell lots of furry cards, but hang 'em. Today is for celebrating love itself, not trying to make people be extra-nice to each other for a day. Can you imagine me getting MORE gooey on one day of the year? Today is one of my favourite days, because I believe in love. Being single makes it easier for me to like it.  Despite not thinking this is a day for special tokens of love or adoration I'm going to do one of those sickening valentine's messages. These are the people I'm thinking of especially today.     Laura  - Guess why? For the less intelligent of you I'm kind of obsessed with her, and also worried cause she's all not here and everything.    Zoe  - Probably cause I love her in a way I'm not sure how to describe. She's not like a sister (although to her I'm like a lillebror, apparently) but she's not like I'm... y'know... in love with her. It's kind of odd. But she's irreplaceable.    Lisa  - I really don't know her, and somehow that means I'm thinking about her.    Fi  - Cause she's fairly close despite knowing her for a ridiculously small amount of time. This thought also goes to Ging for being with her, hope that goes well!    Nikky + her boyfriend  - Nikky's just really cool, and so for that reason I'm kind of hoping nothing goes wrong ever there.    Sam/Maya/The Devil  - Cause I haven't talked to her for ages, and I tend to feel I've been a bit of a git to her...    Libby + Tobin  - They're just really sweet...    Sarah  - Cause she's kind of got a thing for me, and sometimes I think I'm a bit too grown-up with her.    Sally Grant  - She cool.    Rachel Foxwell  - I'd do anything to protect her voice, cause it rules the earth.    Mel  - Scott's kind of obsessed with her, and as such she gets a place in my thoughts.    The girls - Suz and Gwen  - Cause I looove them, even though most of the time they piss me off.    The group - Adam, Buzzy, Marx, Pete, Scott, Stanners  - I looove them, cause they rule.     Sorry if I've missed you out and you were expecting to be on there. I'm thinking about eeeveryone really, but those are the people my mind is most focused on. Love yas.  Quote of the day; "I'll buy you diamond rings, my friend, If it makes you feel alright. I'd get you anything, my friend, If it makes you feel alright. Cause I don't care too much for money, Cause money can't buy me love."  From the Beatles'   Can't Buy Me Love   Love, Jon Roskilly
