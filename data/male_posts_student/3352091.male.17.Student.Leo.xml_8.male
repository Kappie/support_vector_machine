First and foremost i want to say that i am of the christain faith(for lack af a better title).When someone asks me my religion i say that i am of the faith of the christ. So many people and happenings give the name Christain a bad name, and i understand its not all people but i try to set myself apart. So many "Christians" have become so dogmatic with their demonination or church's viewpoints its pathetic. Instead of listening to preachers and doing everything they say i follow my own path. I try to follow the actions(not so much the words) of Jesus. He was compassionate towards all(even those of different faiths) he listened and was caring towards all. I love the Zen saying "Follow not in the footsteps of the teacher rather, seek what He sought" and i believe with all my soul and heart. Some people may consider this blasphemy (quoting zen wisdom and applying it to christianity) but they are the ones who never seek and are content with being ignorant.  Well my parents are selling the house(as soon as they find a buyer) and they are showing the house today at 330-430 and for some reason i have to leave the house. Go figure. It wont really affect me because since i havnt told you my parents have both divorced and both live in easley, so either way i have a house to stay at here. I may go see my teacher from the summer governors school today in a play he is performing in(lead role i might add) hes a very good and virtuous man. Very wise and i wish i had listened to him more, he taught me the value of tolerance(i dont want to call it that but i dont know what else to call it) well thats enought writing..... for now anywho. Later all
