We have coasted through half a year with some extremely hot tracks, and its time to check on the innovators who keep us grooving by counting down the top 10 producers up to this point. Check in daily for the latest installment.    Producer #9: Rick Rubin      Write Up  Aside from a brief golden year in 1999 (fueled by Limp Bizkit’s “Nookie” and Kid Rock’s “Bawitdaba”), rap/rock hasn’t seen a worthy update since Rick Rubin, who single-handedly took the crossbred genre to its greatest heights in his short-lived heyday. Ever since that three year stint (’86-’88), he has been hailed as a legend, making big news whenever he teams with any act. Being one of those producers who can craft tracks playable for urban and suburban audiences, he has radio stations all over America leaving empty spots their playlists for his work. All evidence considered, there’s good reason for that; Rubin has dropped staples for alternative stations ( Red Hot Chili Peppers'  “Give It Away”) and urban stations (Sir  Mix-A-Lot’s  “Baby Got Back”) alike. Maintaining the  American  label, Rubin maintained his status as an album-producer, not a one-track donator, as he constructed discs with A-list veterans like  Mick Jagger  and  Johnny Cash  (the latter co-winning a  Grammy  with Rubin for the ’97 release  Unchained).  As for now, Rubin is laying low but has made a brief return as a singles-only producer, a method that likely puts him out of the running for the  Producer(s) of the Year   Grammy . Still, a man more for the music than the praise, Rubin seems content with the occasional eardrum-buzzing bash as opposed to the quietly graceful opus, both of which he’s proved capable of.

Unfortunately, Rubin did little to tweak Bizkit’s sound, an unmarketable flaw maybe more blamable on  Fred Durst’s  ego than Rubin’s ear. “Eat You Alive,” the lead single, went absolutely nowhere, and neither did the “Behind Blue Eyes” cover, which was released with a steamy Durst-on- Halle Berry  video as the second single. This project is probably Rubin’s biggest mistake, taking a producing job with one of the most overly selective groups in the biz (after all, they held a nationwide search to replace Borland as lead guitarist and found no one). With such an impressive list of past work, including the  Beastie Boys ,  Run-D.M.C. , and the legendary  Johnny Cash , you’d think that Limp Bizkit wouldn’t fit into Rubin’s schedule, and you’re thought would be right.   Career Highlights   Paul Revere - Beastie Boys   Rick Rubin’s  makeshift boogie in “Paul Revere” became one of the most sampled backbeats in hip hop history by no mistake; the hypnotic cymbal slides are as empty as they are intriguing, leaving the listener with equal amounts of loneliness and funkiness, a deadly combination in any rap song. Probably the landmark track off the Beastie’s debut  Licensed to Ill  (all produced by Rubin), “Paul Revere” is a renowned piece that thankfully is kept alive by those numerous samplings.   Blood Sugar Sex Magik  (album)- Red Hot Chili Peppers   (#3)  One of the many milestone albums that  Rubin  has produced in his career (among which are the  Beastie’s   Licensed to Ill  and  Johnny Cash’s   Unchained ), the Red Hot Chili Peppers’  Blood Sugar Sex Magik  is a epic disc filled with focused funk, dribble-drabble lyricism, and the unforgettable “Under the Bridge.” Rubin really showed his craftwork on this album because of his undeniable ability to take a relatively unsuccessful group (in the pop realm) and turn them into superstars without compromising their original sound (which, for the Peppers, was that gritty garage funk). This disc will go down in history with RHCP, a near-guarantee that Rubin has been able to uphold.   2004 Mentionable Tracks (Grammy Material)   99 Problems - Jay-Z   (#30)  Rarely known to stop by and drop a hot single,  Rick Rubin  lived and breathed artiness throughout the 90s, defying his typical rap/rock genre to do pop ( Sheryl Crow’s   Globe Sessions ), blues/rock ( Black Crowes’   Shake Your Money Maker ), and even country ( Johnny Cash’s   Unchained ). But, just as we were all bidding farewell to the late-eighties b-boy that was Rick Rubin, he reemerged with arguably his hardest bite ever, Jay-Z’s “99 Problems.” Mixing the music of  Billy Squier  with the lyrics of  Ice-T , Jay and Rick try to outdo each other in their respective realms; Rick blasts an up-step guitar crunch and some heavy cowbell, Jay rhymes one of his cleverest conversations amidst some wordplay and boast. Combined, the two both achieve a career highlight, all tied together by that recycled, radio-edited, Hova-mouthed catch-line: “Got 99 problems but a bitch ain’t one” (unfortunately, looking at Rubin in the video [see above], that’s the one problem that he might have).
