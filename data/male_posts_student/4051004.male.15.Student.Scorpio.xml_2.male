Can you imagine that someone actually comes up with these reassuring lies about how everything is going great in Iraq and all is according to plan. Lets take a look.... This war is a fraud. I dont even need to talk about the weapons of mass destruction that were never found, or the non-existant links between Saddam and Al Qaida, or any of the other lies we based this war on. I'm talking about new lies, remember when I told you to listen..here's what you might have heard. 1. Same as before the war, the government tells us of threats that dont exist. This creates an atmosphere of fear, and instability. Then the ruling party offers itself as the only solution to comfort the public's fears. What are these threats, why is there an alert....fear of the unknown is always the strongest fear. 2. The second lie is that America's new government is in control of Iraq. Hmm...When suicide bombers ram their cars into hundreds of recruits outside police stations, how on earth can anyone hold an election for their "democratic prime minister" next January? Even the National Conference to appoint those who will arrange elections has been twice postponed. Iraq is deteriorating by the day, why dont journalists tell you that? 3. We arent told any thing that happens unless an American dies. This propaganda is designed to show that our soldiers have feelings, hopes, families, etc. I dont know if I can believe that our soldiers are "only doing a duty" and do not want to kill, while we emphasize that their soldiers are not doing a job and are only heartless muderers who enjoy killing.  What, indeed, are we to make of a war which is turned into a fantasy by those who started it? Our foreign workers pour out of Iraq for fear of their lives , meanwhile our US Secretary of State,Colin Powell tells a press conference that hostage-taking is having an "effect" on reconstruction. Effect! Oil pipeline explosions are now as regular as power cuts. In parts of Baghdad now, they have only four hours of electricity a day; the streets swarm with foreign mercenaries, guns poking from windows, shouting abusively at Iraqis who donâ€™t clear the way for them. I don't even think I need to get into the Abu-Gharaib prison abuse. This is the "safer" Iraq which Mr Tony Blair was boasting of the other day. What world does the British Government exist in? And Bush's regime?  This countrys on the brink. People on the top should learn from history, that when you dont control your own government, people want to kill you.
