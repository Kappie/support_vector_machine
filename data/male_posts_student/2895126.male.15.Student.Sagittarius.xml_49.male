We're going to some Memorial Day thing with a friend of my Mom's sometime soon; he has connections with someone who owns a farm (or, in this case, perhaps a ch√¢teau) and is going to be cooking an entire lamb. Cool. And because this friend of my Mom's is rather "upper class" this could turn out to be very ritzy.  I'll fill ya'll in.
