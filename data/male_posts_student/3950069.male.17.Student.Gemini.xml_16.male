No man is more blessed than me, and I love you with all my heart."       -The Notebook         "Love, in these last and tender hours   is sensitive and very pure   Come morning light with soft-lit   powers   to awaken love that's ever sure."   -Walt Whitman     11th August 2004, today was actually alright, it felt a little strange though because I haven't had such a day for quite a period of time. I was late for everything and that simply took away my mood to even attend school. So, I didn't go to school.  Strangely, it has been a long time since I spent a day with no destination and alone. I wandered around, just like the wonders I had in my mind, it wasn't soul-searching but purely giving more thought about what I have gone through so recently and reminiscing about everything in the past. Maybe some times, nostalgia isn't the best thing. There are times I find myself back where I used to be in the past, too much nostalgia brings back the pain and hurt i've been through but I cherish every memory and every moment that I have lived through.  I felt myself, tracing back the steps we took, together the path we chose to walk. One step at a time,   I see you in all the familiar places  , memories can take me so far, but I wished you were there with me. I walked around at Junction8, thought about the things we talked about yesterday and how good it felt to see you, all I needed was one glimpse of you to lighten my emotions and lift me up. I remember taking my dinner while you accompanied me, and so cheekily took pictures of me eating -amused- I feel special, every time you're somewhere close to me.  I went back to Marina, I really wanted to. Sunday was a fantastic night, but it wouldn't have meant anything if I didn't have you with me. I watched  The Notebook  for the second time. I read the book recently, completing it where I last stopped, and this time while I watched the movie the words and pictures just seemed to fall in place like a puzzle. It was beautiful, really, and what was so good about it was that I was able to share it with you on Sunday. I sat in my seat, comfortable but a little chilly in the cinema. I just remembered then, how cold you felt that you kept sneezing and I put my arms around you to pull you closer, hoping you'd feel warmer. I could feel you, your hand holding on to mine, tightly as you placed your head on my shoulder. Or when we shared the Hotdog I bought and you, you sneaked in some fries we had gotten at Mac before we went to the cinema.   You  called me, today, while I was watching the movie alone. I was glad really, to know you cared, but i'm also sorry I made you worry. I could feel you with me, I really did. Some how, hearing your voice leaves me feeling so settled and safe wherever I am.  Xing, thank you. I know I made you worry as well but i'm alright, really. I just took the day off, to wander around alone and spend some time thinking. I do love being alone actually, moments like what I used to have. But I still need my friends, I still need the girl I love, I need my family.  It feels as though I have grown a couple years older after all the thinking, maybe i'm just a lil tired, haha.  I find my passion for poems, as well as writing being rekindled.   "Our souls were one, if you must know   and never shall they be apart;   With splendid dawn, your face aglow   I reach for you and find my heart."       you are the closest thing to an angel i've seen
