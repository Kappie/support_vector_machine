Here's a list of things I did (I might have missed some stuff)...  1. Went to Washington, D.C., Amish Country (Lancaster County, PA), New Jersey, and New York with my senior class ('05!). 2. Father's Day at Black Angus. 3. Super Senior Summer Smash at Alex Burt's house. 4. Cross Country practices. 5. ....  Wow, pretty uneventful. June was a blah month I guess. Well I'm outty for now, gonna go barbecue with the folks. Have fun and be safe with those fireworks!  Cy
