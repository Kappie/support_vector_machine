I've been dreading this day where life after school no longer has any reasons  for me to keep in contact with school acquintances. with my circle of friends reducing. I don't want to look at my contact list and find only a handful of hangout-able friends.  I don't want to be lonely... I wanna find a GAL hu can go out with me everyday...so bored  I guess I'm the type of guy who falls into the "geeky dude who plays computer games, watch anime,  and hang out with guy buddies only" group. ps:i am not a gay  A horny girl/crazy guy messaged me on irc, asking me to add her/him on irc and MSN. she keep bringing up the topic of sex and dirty stuff If she/he's a she, then Wow, I've found a rare wild girl in Singapore. If she/he's a he, IS HE GAY? Anyway i did not add him/her  Hell yeah man my friend nicholas juz came to my house and fixed up my drums and o my god, its like magic... he tuned it like fark man it sound so freaking good....o mi god will i turn into a gay(kidding)
