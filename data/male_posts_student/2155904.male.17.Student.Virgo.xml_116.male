Cuz there is no need to ramble on idiocies.  Oh wait, that is what this blog is based upon.  Oh well.  Today started off nicely.  The faint light of the sun shone through Tyke's curtains and illuminated the pale green hue of his walls.  It was picturesque.  Then he realized that the sun was shining in his eye and it hurt.  But it was still nice.  He got up and had nothing to do so he decided to pick out his outfit for his final job shadow needed.  Yep, the 6th time going out to KING got him his 30th hour completed.  That is a lot of time.  He needed to look semi-nice so he found something good.  Then he just hung out at his house for a while.  He went upstairs to the top floor where he has hardly been all week.  It was different since the last time even.  His mom had painted the guest bathroom.  It is a little bit paler than the color of his room but similar.  It looks nice though.  Painting actually does a lot to a room.  Tyke has been shocked by that fact.  His old house was hardly painted at all.  This new one is getting painted all over.  But at about 3 he left for Seattle and KING.  He went to Mickey D's on the way and got a great Reese's McFlurry.  That is easily the best flavor.  Damian Easley.  He got to the station at like 3:15 and called up his guy who was coming back from his house cuz he forgot his jacket.  He said he'd be back in like 5 minutes and would just pick up Tyke in the front of the station.  So Tyke waited outside the lobby on the bench.  Time started to pass and Tyke began to recognize some of the cars driving by.  He saw the same bus drive by at least 3 times.  Maybe more.  Time ticked to about 3:45 and Tyke began to wonder if he should call his guy.  For some reason he didn't and just played games on his cell phone.  Then time flew and it became 4:10.  At this point he really thought he should call his guy but he waited until 4:20.  It was such a nice day out and it wasn't cold so it wasn't like he was uncomfortable.  He called his guy though and he came down and picked him up.  He felt really bad about forgetting him but it showed Tyke's patience and dedication.  Sorta dedication.  But Tyke can be dedicated, that is the point.  He got up and watched the Zags game and just kept an eye out for important details or plays or anything.  There wasn't really anything in it so he just became a stat checker and fact looker-upper.  It was alright.  Then he went down and watched the 5 o'clock broadcast from the studio.  He has seen so many broadcasts it is nothing interesting now.  Almost bland.  Yeah, he is a vet down there.  After that they went back up and worked on the 6:30 show.  They got on the topic of pies though and had a long discussion about that.  Tyke loves both pumpkin and peanut butter pies.  Mmmm...whipped cream.  Last time Tyke was writing here he talked about a bunch of things but he doesn't want to go into that again.  Oh well, it was just about food.  Well, after that they hung out for a while and then Tyke left at about 7.  He had a nice ride home and just sat and sang and thought about stuff.  You know what about.  But nobody in particular.  Just generalities.  He got home and went downstairs and watched some tv.  Castaway was on and that is a really good movie so Tyke watched it.  How much would that suck to be in that situation?  Tyke would be extremely depressed.  He might not make it.  But Tyke mainly thought about what he would be missing.  Just that longing feeling he would always have.  If he thought that it was bad to long now it would be horrible by himself on an island.  But you know what, Tyke isn't going to talk anymore about that.  His first blog attempt was mainly based upon that but now he is tired of talking.  So he will just let you all think of what Tyke would say.  You pretty much know what he would talk about it anyway.  So it isn't a new thing.  All repetitive stuff anyway.  So goodnight.  Or goodbye if you read this on Sunday which it is now.  Damn, Sunday.  Stupid school.
