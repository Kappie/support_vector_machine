I've been updating my xanga more than I have this, but mostly because I get more exposure with that than I do this one- I'm going to keep this one for rants that my "inner circle" of readers always gets to. I'm not sure who that is anymore...  This is a bit of a call to anybody that reads this- post in the comments your name or screen name. I need to know if this journal is worth updating.
