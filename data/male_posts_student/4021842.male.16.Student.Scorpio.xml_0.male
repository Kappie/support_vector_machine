Go Concerts in the Downtown Ghetto! Anywho the bullet was an inch and a half away from shattering my shoulder blade....it went through about two inches of skin and cardeledge and out the other end. Damned shoot outs! Next time i bring my 12 gauge shotgun...we'll see who wants to mess with me...all over a hot chick too...DAMN IT!!! *sigh* oh well...fun times....i got the bullet:D hehehehe....it still hurts like a bitch and i can't move it all that much...but i suppose it'll be alright in the next few weeks...i have to take some pills and the doctor shoved a long ass needle in my shoulder...that hurt like a mother fucker...stupid counteracting lead poisoning:S oh well that's my story, if you'd like to know more ask me on msn...it's not biggie i just can't type very fast!...buh byez
