They always have the best fireworks. I drove down to Dayton to pick up Troy. The ride went perfect on the way to Dayton, but once in it went down hill. We had to call Troy to come and pick us up. Then we went back to the Crime Lab so he could park his car their (were he works). He parked their and he drove the rest of the way to Cincinnati. At first there wasn’t many people their, but at the last minute they all came. We got their really early and saved a very good seat. We were like the first person their. We got to set down while most of the other people had to stand up.   I sent the money order out for the new domain. The hosting has gone excellent so far. The customer service rocks! I can’t wait for everything to finally work out. I am going to make a sub domain for MTV. I hope to stream some small video files once everything is up and running. Man I love Front Page Extensions.  We won the football game on Friday. We are 2-0 so far. I hope we do good again. Playoffs were so much fun. Of course it had to rain for the whole game. Lucky I was inside helping, but I went outside to screw around and help the other camera people. I was soaked, so was Zach. I had a blast though. They had some HOT cowgirls! Yikies. Zach ended up staying the night and everything went hunky dory after that.   Pretty soon I should go to Radio Shack to fill out an application. My bank account is on E. My goal now is to take lots and lots of pictures. If I get a job, I want to get a new digital camera. The one I have now is from 7th grade. It is only 1 megapixel and sucks batteries like hell. Oh well, it works! These moments only happen once. I would prefer a smaller one over features. That is more important to me. Something that will fit in my pocket. Mine now is a hog. Put I still love it. Took many pictures on it with my 64MB CF card.   Not very excited about these upcoming two weeks. I will be staying about my dad’s house. Talk about no technology. It’s like little house on the parry. All of this while my motherboard is in the mail and my domain is being created. This sucks. I should be able to break away from it at least once a week, maybe twice. I can blog at school, but not check my e-mail. They would have a fit (the way I do).   I can’t find any more information in my brain for now.  Until next time,  ==Eric==
