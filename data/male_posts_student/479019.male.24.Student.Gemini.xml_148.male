It was to give Samantha a break from being stuck working in the same room with Margarita, and for a slight change of scenary. I don't think old Margarita is willing to treat me like she does Samantha because she knows I don't take her crap as readily as Samantha...  In other news, my family and I got new cell phones. I got a Motorola v66 for myself, but tomorrow I'm going to try to go back and trade it in for the cheaper, but way cooler Samsung R225. The Motorola is cool, but I don't like the menu system and I don't think I'll use as many of the functions. So in the end I should get a lot of money back and get a cooler phone.  Also I've decided to go eat with Naomi this weekend, because according to my nifty MS Outlook, it's her birthday this weekend. Looks like in addition to that, we'll be getting family portraits this weekend too. Time to get the shirt and tie out again.  ***
