I looove my days in Seven Pillars (theater classes) cuz thats where i met one of my crushes... ( he said "one" of his crushes...ooohh! he's a ten-timer!!! jowk!) that was a place i enjoy being in while being with good friends at the same time... oh those were some great days...  Phoem( her name's a secret ) , and the rest of my gud girl buds will always be in my mind...
