You know he just makes crap up. He's done songs on gays and retarded people and there was nothing wrong with that??? Oh well, I think its one of his best songs   urlLink "Kill A Kitten"  by Stephen Lynch  Other then the controversy of the kitten song, not a whole lot has happened except for parties and getting ready for our own party.  Swang a few times on monday, great fun as always (hurt myself pretty bad, but I'm not the one to complain, after I sandwiched Kyle into the dirt)   Can't wait till christmas! Its gonna be loads of fun! Hope to see you at the party (P.S. there aren't any inventions, just come and you'll be welcomed......hopefully=) )
