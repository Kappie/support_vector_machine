Soon I plan to transfer my old entries on LiveJournal here ...   Anyways - yesturday we went to this dumpy beach on  urlLink Lake Norman - it's called Lake Norman State Park. The waters were infested with duck dung. It was a disgrace and I refused to step foot in the water. We were there about a half hour and left - came home to the pool. It's so hot here ! It peaks around 90 with a heat index of 96. Of course the house is central air, so I don't mind it.   There is this really nice mall down the street ... it's outdoor and is like a real little town, it has streets and several buildings, and on the bottom floor there are shops, and above them apartments. It's called Birkdale. Look at photo of it:     We play volleyball everyday in the back yard. I love it. I wish there were more volleyball outlets in Williamsport. My dad is on a quizzical "workout" regimine. He gets up and runs "5 miles" - of course everything is exaggerated, so it's about a mile or two. Then is exhausted the rest of the day. Then he insists on leaving his sweatshirt on the rest of the day -- in 90 degree weather because he "wants to sweat" which can lead to dehydration on a humid day. He thinks it makes him loose weight, when technically it burns very few  urlLink calories  - which is the foundation of all weight control.   Random Thought: Isn't it so sad that most dogs never have sex in their lives ??   I love ...  urlLink Blistex Medicated Lip Balm  - the green kind  I hate ...  urlLink Diet Coke with Lime  (side note: I  love  Diet Coke and caffeine free Diet Coke)   Feedback Question: Do you like embedded links ?   >>Leave a comment.
