And we left our old one at ncol cuz it was screwed up.  Just now they figure out that they can fix it and it's gonna be fixed by next week, so I'm gonna have my own computer then...which is cool cuz doing all my randon non-porn-related things on the computer is annoying when my parents and brother are right behind me.  This means there is gonna be some massive rearrangement in my room cuz my room is little and kinda cluttered.  Umm...I  think  that's all.  Go be cool expressive unique people and go smell some flowers and pet some kitties and hug some old fellas.
