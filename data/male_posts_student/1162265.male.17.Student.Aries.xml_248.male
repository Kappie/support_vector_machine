I have a journalism research paper, which in theory shouldn't be that bad, I've already started, but realized I didn't note my research so the writting of the paper is becoming really stop and go, but I can deal with that aspect of the research.  It'll just take forever to write, and it'll come out sub-par, I'll end up worrying about it, and Mrs. McGrane will just give a B (possibly with a plus or minus as garnish) regardless of how well I write it (that's not true at all).  I had a black people bonding moment today.  It made me feeel all grown up.  This lady was trying to pick up her grandson from SHU and she couldn't find him so she was panicking and asking me for directions.  I told her to call him, but neither her or her grandson had a cell phone, so I let her use mine.  I had to get in her car (she was an old black church lady though, so it was all good) and guide her to the place, and it ended up we missed her grandson who had to run around the block to catch her.  But no worries, it's all good, because he came and I got a ride home.  The whole community thing that goes on with black people is always nice, and I feel glad to know I contributed something positive too it.  The funny thing, since I try to cut down on the amount of parent-personal life dialogue, I don't plan on ever telling them about it.  I'm strange I guess.
