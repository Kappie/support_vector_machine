It feels like me and him... well, it feels like it was a dream because I havn't seen him for so long. Today I was talking w/him and he brought up something and we kinda blew up at eachother. Look what this trip is doing to me, but more importantly, the "us". I can't recall the the last time that I hugged him or how it felt but I have a picture of him in my head that is seen clearly. I was at a stop light and he went right infront of me. I cried so hard on that trip home, It was just hitting me that I wouldn't see him for that long! I arrived home and was glad to see my mom home because I ran into her arms and received and much needed hug. I think it was the first time I hugged my mom in awhile. It just goes to show that no matter what, moms really are there for you and I appriciate that. I can't remember the first time I talked to Bill because at that time I was talking to probably nine or ten people that I kinda liked at that time. I can however remember the first time I saw him in person, there he was sitting so patiently for me. I love that kid and... I dunno, I speechless (and crying) right now....     ok         gimme a second          Ok, yeah I just need to get home, get back into the swing of things. I think this trip is putting me through alot of stress and everything good and bad. I never cried harder the nights leading up to my leaving. I hope he knows that I love him! I think I should have to bow down to him and do what ever, he's to great of a thing in my life and I should treat him that way. But really... Oh my gosh! way to get off topic martin! Ugh, I'm gonna go to sleep now! g'nite peeps!!
