The betting on who it might be would seem to favor sniveling yes-man Waylon Smithers. For years he has harbored a secret crush on his boss, the evil nuclear tycoon Mr- Burns. But the show's producers refused to tell fans at the sci-fi and comic book gathering Comic-Con International if he's the one. In the episode, Springfield legalizes gay marriage, and Homer Simpson becomes a minister by registering online. Matt Groening, the show's creator, joked that Homer is the one to come out as gay. Information leaked across the net has already told us that Patty Bouvier will be the one coming out next season."
