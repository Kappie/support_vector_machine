' climbed your arms  then you pulled away  a new cavity moved into  my heart today  the more she sings  the more it seems that  that now I'm through  now I'm through  with the new you  I drove you home then  you moved away  new cavity moved into  my heart today  the more I scream  the more it seems  now I'm through  now I'm through  with the new you  new you '
