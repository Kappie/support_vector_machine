"if i know you, you have an answer for everything and are always very sure about everything." its true. i do have an answer for most of life's little challenges - whether its in my life or someone else's. and, yes, i am sure about most everything. i am aconfident person. i can read people and situations very well - well, at least most of the time.   right now, i have no answers. i'm not confident. its not a side of me that people see.  ever . i'm not weak. i don't pretend to be. people see me as hardcore, unapproachable, distant, uncompassionate, unemotional, an asshole....the list goes on. some of that truly is me. and some of it is a facade.   in my life, i've learned that the only way to not get screwed over is to be those things. but, in the end, i'm only screwing myself over. to put up that facade is to put up a brick wall around you. you don't let anyone get close to you; no one ever knows the real you. its unfortuanate. then you've separated and/or alienated yourself from all of your friends.   because of this separation, i sit back and watch the world of my friends. i'm just barely in their world....kinda clutching at the very limits. i see them evolving into different people, i see them making new friends and letting go ofothers. i see the mistakes they are about to make. then, i'm there to help - if needed - when the mistake has been made. but, i don't want to be clutching on; there to bat clean up. but, the thing is, i've tried so hard to push everyone away that i've actually succeeded. except for a few people. and i consider them to be my closest and best friends. they know who they are. they're always there for me. and i appreciate that so much.   in the end, i'm looking for a good, long, lasting, loving, decent, relationship. i don't know where to find that exactly. i have a start, but thats where the confusing circles start. the shrowd of mystery needs to come off. i need a sign. ineed someone to point it out to me. i need that special someone in my life. i need her to just let me know. i need, i need, i need.....
