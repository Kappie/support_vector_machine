I left an hourlate because my new boss is retarded and thoughthe would leave for the bank right before i was supposed to leave. If I had left when i was supposed to, there would have only been one person on the floor. How nice.         On a slightly happier note, Im not hungover today. Thats always good. Anyway.        Thas all fo now. Hasta.
