No one to eat the rest of my cereal.  A few weeks ago I noticed a cereal on the supermarket shelf I'd never seen before -- Quisp.  Apparently it's a cereal from the '70s that Quaker recently brought back.  It tastes like Captain Crunch.  I don't like Captain Crunch.  My latest purchase is Life cereal.  I'm not sick of it.  Yet.  There's an article in The Onion this week (www.theonion.com) about a guy whose e-mails to his friends are too long.  Aw, he just needs a weblog.  :)
