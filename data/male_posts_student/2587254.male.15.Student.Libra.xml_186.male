Yeah I realize I did this on Monday, but yeah eventually after some last-minute descision-making *waking up and deciding* I then thought "alright I'll go." So I then got up, headed downstairs, ate a banana for breakfast, and then headed for the bus stop.    Getting to downtown a wee bit late *due to lateness of bus* I then met up with Rebecky and Jason and then we went to William's for lunch. Heh haven't been there since school ended, and I actually almost forgot how good that place can be. Anyways ate some food there, Rebecky tried Italian Soda, and then headed to a few stores in downtown. Rebecky managed to find a $130 purse from Adidas on our adventure. I actually saw a store with a pair of old school green adidas track pants, but expensive......REALLY expensive. So left that store, and then while heading to my bus stop, Rebecky introduced me to the CD store that is literally l33t....    The Madrigal.    THEY HAVE EVERY CD I CAN THINK OF....that's not contemporary, which means every GOOD CD. Duke Ellington, Chicago, even those Chinese piano prodigies that you always hear of but never hear them actually play....holy crap they are insane. Me and Rebecky then wonder why we can't piano like those crazy people. Anyways, I'll be back there again, next time with cash =).    So then we headed to Masonville. Walked around and looked at stuff. I'm horrible at DDR yet again, but at least they have DDR Extreme now =).    Anyways I'm gone. That was basically my day. It was a lot more fun though, as I know my describing is dull right now. I'm too lazy to elaborate, as food is waiting on the table for me....and food is good. So....in conclusion, yes today was funny, a lot of inside jokes between me Jason and Rebecky now hahahahahahaha.     "No Rebecky you need this book, Carmen needs this one." *points out another book*     I won't name the books, but Jason and Rebecky know what I'm talking about haha =P.    Anyways I'm out now....dinner heehee.    Later.
