This weekend though will be a study free zone as I spend time catching up with friends. Tomorrow night I'm going ten pin bowling with a group of friends to celebrate my flatmate Mike's birthday. It will be interesting, because as with most sports I have two levels of play, I either have a great game, or a complete disaster!  Hopefully also on Monday I will play the pool challenge which has been postponed many times. A friend of mine, Andy, and I challenged two friends of ours to a game of pool a while ago, in a moment of great (and quite possibly misplaced) confidence. Now the time has almost come for us to back up our words with actions. Many of our friends are keen to see this, as they think (or hope) that Andy and I will suffer a humiliating defeat.
