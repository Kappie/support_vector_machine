As friendships pass and people float downstream, you start to wonder, why am I telling people the ship is sinking and watch them jump off the plank when in fact it is floating better than ever? Noone can ever predict exactly what is going to happen to them in the future. Noone can acuratly portray their life. The human brain becomes clouded with time and it is aggrevated with life. Titles are placed on you and you place titles on people, barely noticing it. What people fail to recognize is that titles themself are a problem. What is the big deal if you are a "best" friend. Why rank people. What will that accomplish other than insult the lower ranked people and overinflate the ego of the people you rank high. It doesn't matter what the fuck happens in life, it invariably scews up one way or another. As franicked ship members become nothing but flotsam and jetsam, you really start to wonder "Could I have prevented this". And you know that if you hadn't yelled the ship is sinking everyone overboard, the mess would be gone. Why is life so full of these fickle little things? Some trace it back and blame it on the serpent in the Garden of Eden deciving Eve and bringing evil into the world. Some blame it on so-called "Luck". Some just say they are having a bad day. If that holds true then I guess I've been having a bad life? And then on top of that the constant blur that is friendship. Some people guilt you into saying something, even if you say that you don't know what to say. The constant ins and outs of life are stressing and are pissing me off. I caught myself on the phone saying "I hate my life. Hey look there is a bottle of tylenol on my desk, how many are in the bottle" and then I proceeded to opening the bottle! Thank goodness the party on the other end informed me of what I was doing and stopped me. After ending a friendship your emotions are left raw and bloody, like a scraped knee. It leaves you vulnerable, and when friends start fighting right then and there, you feel powerless and lost. You wonder why people care so much about friendships. Theres a million and a half things you would love to yell in your friends face, but heaven forbid they ever hear it let alone you lose them. If I lost my friends I would of lost the best treasure I have. But why are friends so necessary. On MSN during three way conversations, are the other two parties talking about me behind my back? When you get a phone call, is there another person on the line, making the person who recieved the call a victim? This life is so full of twists and turns why do I live it. Why do I continue to live my life. Up until today I had a very good answer which prevented me from thinking further into why and if my life should be continued. The old answer is replaced by this new one. If I die, I lose the best people I have ever known in my life. My Friends. Especially T.T. and M.C. (as of 05/04 This no longer applies :) And why would I put them through the most tramautic thing that can happen (or one of the worst). That would be selfish and idiotic. My mother would just die if I did. And my friends would be so hurt it would make me so angry. So why do I continue living? So that I can be with them now instead of later.
