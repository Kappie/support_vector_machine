YOU!!  +  urlLink google toolbar  (mainly allows you to search from any window, and it blocks pop-ups!)  + SAT, PSAT, AP, and SAT II prep books...Princeton Review is good because it gives you an online SAT and...other  urlLink pointless things ...  +  Farewell to Arms  by Ernest Hemingway and  Ceremony  by Leslie Marmon Silko (if you're like me and waited till now to read)  +  urlLink Action Plan: Juniors   + stupid obvious things like the registration folder, binder, paper (BLUE PAPER...), pens, scissors, cellphones, mufflers
