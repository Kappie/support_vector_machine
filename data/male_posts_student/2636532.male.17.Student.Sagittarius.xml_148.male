Interesting side note, Jason seems to have this obsession with me now for some reason. I blocked him on my messenger a while agojust because he was a pest but i never have messenger open so i forgot that i had blocked him. a few days ago mind you i went though my contact list and saw that he had changed his name to something about me blocking him. Ok so the first thing that comes to mind is why would he care? the next is why would he change his sign in name to that? and thirdly why would he take the effort to find out that? I've come to only one conclusion about this, he's obviously in love with me and gets jealous when i avoid him.   Well Jason i'm sorry to disappoint you but i am straight, i always have been, and i'm extremely comfortable with the fact that i am.  -Matt
