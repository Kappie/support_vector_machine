We seem to be getting more and more engrossed in the phone conversation and unaware of the surroundings. A sociological explanation of this phenomenon is it's a struggle between  "in" group - those on the phone - against those in the "out" group, or people in close proximity to the talkers.   Another intersting thing, what is known as the actor-observer phenomenon. Quoting James Katz, "When you see other people doing things, you think they are doing it for selfish reasons, but when you do it, you feel you are on morally high ground,"  I think most of you suffer from this phenomenon, barring myself of course.   urlLink This picture is absolutely hilarious
