I remember when that place was built freshman year of college.  Then I spent the afternoon at the Norton Simon museum with Naomi R. That's a cool museum. It's free admission AND parking, plus you get a free print of a work of art! I managed to make it home from Pasadena in 1.5 hrs during rush hour, which was really cool. I was expecting 2 hrs.  Then it was watching Smackdown with Derek and Jon.  Today I wrote like half a paragraph so far.  I feels like a Saturday.  Nai's going away dinner tonight.  It's so sad... the female posse aka the Cambridge crew is scattered all over now. Flo in Texas, Nai in Maryland, Julia in San Diego, Janet in Torrance, and Steff in Irvine.  The other Naomi is in Israel, Kaho is up in the bay area, Andy is down in San Diego, and Derek might be going to Utah.  I go back to Binghamton in 5 days.  ***
