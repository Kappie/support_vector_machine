I disagree with the war because of how it's been conducted and how the president has been jerking the troops around.  The troops are being abused by Executive actions to manipulate them into staying longer than they have to.  I support the troops in their fight to get home unscathed.  Their risk of being hurt or killed increases when their term of service in Iraq is extended.  I do disagree with the orders they've been given.  But I don't disagree with their willingness to follow those orders after they've sworn to protect their country and fight for what's right.  And again, because so many motivations for engaging and continuing this war are highly questionable, the troops are, at best, being ordered to fight for things that only  may  be right.  This is unacceptable.  If you are going to risk your life for something, the person who tells you to do it sure as hell better have a good reason.  The majority of the reasons are vague, full of  urlLink glittering generalities  , and are frequently just lip service to keep Americans complacent and willing to give up their   urlLink civil liberties  to defend against an overblown perception of the threat of terrorism.  This is the reason that I am not in the military and wouldn't go even if I was drafted, save the threat of an intergalactic invasion.  And I owe an unpayable debt to those who go to war in place of me who refuses to take part.  They are literally saving me from the risk of death associated with active duty during war time.  It is OK to support military personnel without supporting the war that they are fighting.  It just takes a little more thought.  And it ain't even that complicated.
