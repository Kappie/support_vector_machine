Right now, although I could have written the following on other nights, in Mexico or in Panama City, it is night and I am in David, the capital of Chiriqui Province, in southwestern Panama.  I´ve only seen one other American here.  This isn´t a tourist city.  It isn´t even a pretty city, to be honest, although Boquete and the regions north of here are said to be extraordinary, with verdant coffee and citrus plantations, like heaven in the form of agriculture and cool air.  (I´ve seen similar in Costa Rica.)    But I stayed in David because I played it safe: tomorrow I must catch the bus back to Panama City.  I go through so many different emotions.  Sometimes, as in the Bocas del Toro yesterday, on a power boat through the islands, in the middle of the tropics, I was struck by a kind of euphoria, as if I had reached some kind of Shangri-La, because of the wilderness.  It makes my heart leap to be there, it makes me want to lose myself! (to imagine the paraphrased reaction of an English or German Romantic.)  But then a gritty city like David -- it really cuts me down to size.  It can say: you are nothing.  You are insignificant in this enormous world, which is oblivious to you.  So often, money is what buys a smile, and you really feel it here; if you don´t have money, you´re nothing.  And if I protest that now, I hypocritically ignore the beggars, who haunt the streets of Latin America and the conscience.      Sometimes, I do not see myself spending much more time in Latin America, whatever the term means.  (I still think it´s a useful term, and I could expostulate on why.)  I do not recognize myself in the return glances of the people, or in the central plazas, gritty and worn reflections of their ideal selves, and in the poverty and the dirt, which makes itself felt in David and in Panama City.  Latin America is a difficult place.  Particularly for the outsider.  Then again, no place is easy for the person who approaches it alone.         Is mine one of many ¨"Latin American" realities?  Is it a definitive reality, naked?  Or, am I seeing too much too darkly?  What is the Christian way of seeing Latin America, what is right and what is socially just?  What is the answer for these people, for the Panamanians, who have just elected Martin Torrijos, the son of a populist dictator, to be their new president?  The newspapers speak of a Latin loss of confidence in representative government.      And I say to myself somethimes, perhaps wrongly, or because it is a weak moment spent alone, that I should go someplace else, farther away from the Gulf of Mexico that laps up against Houston, to Asia.  Or, that I should not go anywhere, but just stay in Texas for now and get down to work.  I have a law career to develop.   Latin America cannot be idealized.  In most cases, it should not be.  It must be accepted at face value.
