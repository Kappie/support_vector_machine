I've got around 300 plus the cash i've saved up and all.............hmmm......but i don't think you'd be very interested to hear of my monetary pursuits today. So, anyway.........hmmm, i've been feeling kinda depressed today and yesterday, i kept thinking about her..........but since so many people's eyes are fixed on this blog, i'll shut up about her as well........lol  Anyway, its kinda spooky, after my 2nd post about the whole christian feminist thing, the google ad on top started displaying christian stuff, like bible schools and the like...........i mean its like, how the heck did they know what i typed? lol. I've also been thinking alot of stuff today. Music especially, music. I've been learning three slayer songs this morning and its pretty easy except for the off-key solos (thanks jeff, king......)......But i've really been thinking about my growth and development as a musician  My sister was there at my cousin's house singing, and i was thinking to myself, i don't think i could play guitar or the piano in front of that many people.........inferiority complex or not, i don't know. But, i see music as more of an outlet for expression, instead of an entertaining art form. My attitute towards music especially which i improvise and ocassionally compose, is that i don't really give a shit whether people likes it or not, or whether even if its musically pleasing to the ears. Those pop-punk posers care too much of that, ohhhh, will my record label like it? Will the fans like it?  Teenagers nowadays think that they're so darn rebellious but they're nothing but a pathetic lapdog to this generic pop culture. I mean, look at WA mozart, beethoven and the like They just compose, improvise, even if the song drags on for 20 minutes, who cares if the audience get bored? Music, has always been to me, a form of expressing feelings, emotions and beliefs, and sometimes certain emotions can be so deep and complex that it takes a long long time to really say it out............  Music really chronicles the different milestones and phases of your life. Sometimes, you can tell how a person feels when he/she chooses to express him/herself from the chosen outlet of expression, and in this case its music. Music to me, has been like a soulmate,..............everytime when I pick up a guitar and improvise its almost like talking to a confidante, everytime when i'm drunk or just pretty tipsy on beer and i stop feeling anything on my fingertips when i fret the notes, and just play intuitively, its really like having sex. That's what music is, it is not an overexagerration to say that playing music is like having sex. That's why i always believe that 3 minute pop songs is tantamount to pre-mature ejaculation, there's just too much emotion and energy involved in a true musician's playing that it takes time to express it all out.  To me, it doesn't take much skill to express your feelings through music. In guitar, i can take at most a week to learn a simple song over a few basic chords and this very song can be my emotional outlet. True, the playing and singing may suck, but who cares? You're ultimately doing what a true musician always does, expressing him/herself instead of wondering is this song nice? Will it be a hit with other people? I mean, i feel that if i play the way i do behind closed doors in my own room in front of other people, its like a public live sex show, that's like, no way! I'm pretty selfish where my music is concerned, i like to keep it to only me and myself................i'm not like the egocentric malmsteen to have all spotlights shining on me as i play in front of thousands of people so that people can worship me as the guitar god or anything, i don't really care about what people think of me as a guitarist. Music, to me, has been very private, so if you don't like how i play, i'm like, buzz off, i don't need your approval, cos' if that's adequate in expressing myself, its good enough for me.
