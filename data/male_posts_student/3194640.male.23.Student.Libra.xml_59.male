I might not be able to answer it now, because I left early. We had a substitute and I didn't feel like staying the whole time. I told the substitute that I had to leave early. I didn't tell her that I'd go crazy if I didn't. The reason I had to leave early was to go get tickets for  urlLink  Spider-Man 2   (which was amazing, by the way. Better than the original) and to go eat dinner at my parent's house. It was my younger brother's 22nd birthday. All my brothers and sisters were there. It was the first time all five of us had been in the same room together for quite a while. It was fun.
