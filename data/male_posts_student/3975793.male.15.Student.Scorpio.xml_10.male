But hey, at least i got to work the air conditioned stand. and for those of you who have wandered on to this site and don't know where i work, i work at six flags new england as a vendor. Life has its ups and downs, i'll go ahead and consider this one of my downs. But the good thing that comes out of all this, is that i have job experience. anywho, on with the show.    ~*~ ~*~ ~*~
