So my last day is the 30th, and I don't have anything else lined up. I have this feeling this is going to come back and bite me in the ass, BIG TIME. But it doesn't matter now, because I won't have to put books away anymore!!    Applyed at Panera Bread Company for a position at their new restaurant somewhat near me, and there was a s^^^load of other people there. Saw some people from my high school, and some people Ihaven't seen since elementary school. But what did I expect, they put a huge ad in the classifieds...   And right now there appears to be a crew cutting off tree limbs in the alley behind my house at ten-thirty at night preventing me from putting my car in the garage. Ah well.
