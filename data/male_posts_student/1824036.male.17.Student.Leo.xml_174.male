First I think I will start with a  urlLink Boss Distortion Pedal . That is something that is pretty simplistic. It isn't  needed  but is great to have if it is convenient.  Next, I absolutely  NEED  a new guitar strap. The one that came with my strat just isn't cutting it anymore. It is leather and crappy leather at that. I think that I am going to get a new  urlLink Kepur Strap  with an  urlLink aum  on it.  And lastly, this is not a necessity, and I dont even really have to buy it, but I want one. So depending on when/if I get a job this summer, and I hope I get a job....any job.... I wil get a  urlLink Crate FXT 120 . It is a 120 watt guitar amp and it has the option of hooking up additional speakers to it as well. Also a nice little toy that could go along with that is a  urlLink wireless guitar amp cable . Nady Blem makes this one.  My mom said she would go halves on some things... like a new amp and/or a new guitar. So I figure only $200 for the amp, $20 for the strap, the full $40 for the distortion pedal, and maybe if I feel like it, $85 for the wireless cable...that comes up to eh...just about too much. I think that I will rethink this before I go and make any rash decisions...  Only think I absolutely need is a new strap...we will build on that later....
