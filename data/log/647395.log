No beam.

Stacking will continue for the entire shift. 1 hr quiet time 
now, then MCR will do TeV studies. Shot setup in the evening. 
Plan is to take cosmics and try to make sure there are no problems for next data taking.

Did QT calibs; now taking cosmics. 10AM: beams are back for TeV studies; chambers and SVX either @stby or off, and we keep running cosmics. CO is looking at consumers' output for the last physcs run taken in the owl shift to watch for early indications of problems. Steve Nahn just called and offered to come in and do the PROM work on his system.

<h3>Wanna buy a used PROM?</h3> 
I upgraded all TSs except the one in Partition 6 (used for ROL testing) and Partition 7 (already had it) to 
PROM1 v58, which gets rid of fake L1 DONE timeouts.  All went 
well (<a href=

ROL is working, we can merge the two TS modifications and once 
again make all Partitions equal.<P> 
<FONT COLOR=RED><B>Until further notice any partition except partition 6 is good for Silicon</B></FONT><P> 
The Aces should periodically (once an hour) change to a different  
partition to see that everything is ok.  If anything bad happens, 
one can always fall back to Partition 7 which was undisturbed and works fine.

We've been runnig in Partition 7, which looked fine after Steve 
Nahn finished working on the TS.

Looking at YMon plots of Run 152171, I found a hole (12 empty channels) in COT crate0 slot12 (from ch24 to ch35). I couldn't find anything wrong (no 12 dead channels) in occupancy plots -- strange!  Talked to experts (Aseet and Kirby), but no explanation.  Going back to other runs (a couple of days ago and a month ago), I found that the same hole has been there more than a month.

Looked at 2d occupancy plots more carefully, I found a strip of 12 dead channels in cell 2 of SL3. The color scheme (yellowish) makes it hard to stand out.  Looks like it's been dead more than a month.

While we were ending, EVB turned red and none of the rest of the crates would end.  We also had a message re:SCPUs which strongly suggested cleaning up EVB.

In partition 0 had some problems with b0tsi00, b0tsi02.  Jason was trying to run silicon test in a different partition (1), and we might have been trying to share the trigger supervisor.  Ended run and decided to only do one thing at a time.

I've been cycling thru the differrent partitions, to see if there are any problems.  So far (at partition 3) there haven't been any problems. The only minor inconvenience has been that the errorlog hasn't passed ColdStart when changing partitions. So I've had to restart run control to change partitions. I don't know if there's a better way to do this, but it wasn't immediately apparent (trying to take the errorlog individually through transitions didn't work.)  
<!-- Author: Karen -->
<!-- Comment: Sat Sep 28 16;43;27 comment by...Arnd -->
The error handler should automatically quit and then restart when changing partitions. Were you always in the start state when changing the partition?

<!-- Comment: Sun Sep 29 08;21;21 comment by...Karen -->
I always changed partition in the start state (and I'm fairly certain that a new error display window had come up for the partition change), but the errorlog still failed to make the ColdStart transition.

Stacking will continue for the entire shift. 1 hr quiet time now, then MCR will do TeV studies. Shot setup in the evening.

Also, previous Scico suggest to go over output of consumers for their last physics run (152171 - see below).

When Greg gets back and verifies ROL is working, we can merge the two TS modifications and once again make all Partitions equal. 
 
Until further notice any partition except partition 6 is good for Silicon 
 
The Aces should periodically (once an hour) change to a different partition to see that everything is ok. If anything bad happens, one can always fall back to Partition 7 which was undisturbed and works fine. 
 
11:11  Problem with COT low voltage alarms missing from iFix has been fixed. As before, alarms generate an audio message and show up on the "data" page (click the "D" button) but not on the main iFix displays that are normally kept running. 
 
11:40  Looking at YMon plots of Run 152171, I found a hole (12 empty channels [wires]) in COT crate0 slot12 (from ch24 to ch35). I couldn't find anything wrong (no 12 dead channels) in occupancy plots -- strange! 
Talked to experts (Aseet and Kirby), but no explanation. The same hole has been there more than a month. Looked at 2d occupancy plots more carefully, I found a strip of 12 dead channels (wires) in cell 2 of SL3. The color scheme (yellowish) makes it hard to stand out. It actually happened on april 14: there were two holes, one of which was fixed, and the other one remained until today. 
 
15:08  Person carrying Si pager called to ask about next shot setup. She recommends the eve SciCo to call main Si pager at the beginning of pbar injection.</pre>
