<pre>Above problem in L1 Cal eta-1 phi-4 in TrigMon (left plot)
was spotted by Carla last night and evening shift crew had 
investigated.  I am just pasting a few more plots from the current
quiet time cosmic run for the experts to look at.  Below is a 
summary of current situation:
- TrigMon plot L1 Had Cal DIRAC Occupancy plot shows a hot cell at 
  eta-1, phi-4, which corresponds ADMEM 17 in PCAL01.
- Spike run and YMon plots do not show any problems
- Kwangzoo checked the corresponding ADMEM and saw no problem. </pre>

I have realized that I have no set "ignore reces", because the crate is no a ccal, it's a pcal, so I'll begin a new run without set "ignore reces".

Kwangzoo came in to try what Mark (i.e. reloading the configuration 
from QIETEST) to see if this fix the PCAL01 L1 Cal Trigger (eta1, 
phi4) problem.  We ended cosmic run to exclude PCAL01 crate.  
<!-- Author: kaori -->
<!-- Comment: Sun Dec 30 10;09;35 comment by...kaori -->
Actually, Kwangzoo wants all PCAL crates, so we don't take any
cosmic run in parallel.

<!-- Comment: Sun Dec 30 10;10;41 comment by...m mattson, k chung (ADMEM) -->
Kwangzoo and I talked a bit.  Since there is no time pressure, we decided to do a calib-and-download for the PCAL crates.  If the HAD trigger channel is being caused by any sort of memory corruption (trigger Et table, CAFE channel look-up table, or the ADMEM configuration), this will fix it.  This is overkill, but will save us the effort of checking things one at a time.
<p>
There is a chance that the problem is with the trigger cable (or connector).  The west steel was opened and closed in the past days, maybe something was vibrated (slightly) loose.  (But we should try the fixes that can be done without an access first.)

The same 3 plots pasted earlier, but after the memory refreshed.
L2Cal Pass13 clusterning is still strange.  Will contact trigger
expert.  But L1 Cal (eta1-phi4) problem is gone.

<!-- Comment: Sun Dec 30 11;05;57 comment by...Laura -->
I'm investigating, but it looks very strange...

<!-- Comment: Sun Dec 30 11;14;03 comment by...kaori -->
Restarting TrigMon (Laura's request).

<!-- Comment: Sun Dec 30 11;14;27 comment by...k chung -->
<pre>The hot trigger tower went away after calib&load (PCALs only). 
This pins down the memory corruption in either Et table or Look-up table which was not so easy to catch in usual qietest.</pre>

<!-- Comment: Sun Dec 30 11;25;57 comment by...kaori -->
TrigMon is restarted.  The first 200 entries already indicate
the same problem (accumulation in the 1st bin) in the L2Cal
Pass13 clustering plots.

<!-- Comment: Sun Dec 30 11;29;17 comment by...Laura -->
Connections between DIRAC_PULSARS are ok. pass10 and pass12 are ok. 

<!-- Comment: Sun Dec 30 11;35;04 comment by...Laura -->
Maybe a trigger table problem...I would contact Tom about that.

<!-- Comment: Sun Dec 30 11;42;29 comment by...kaori -->
Would it help if we try no-track cosmic table and see?

<!-- Comment: Sun Dec 30 11;47;43 comment by...Laura -->
I want to see if in the previous run (before the tower problem)  we had a similar behaviour for pass13... 

<!-- Comment: Sun Dec 30 12;01;26 comment by...twright -->
The COSMICS table has not be recompiled to pick up the new Penn tau algorithm I would guess.


<!-- Comment: Sun Dec 30 12;08;55 comment by...kaori -->
Could you or someone can recompile and make a new COSMIC table?
Shall we try shotsetup (physics) table? (not sure we get enough 
events to look at....)

<!-- Comment: Sun Dec 30 12;51;15 comment by...kaori -->
Run 25577 (Dec. 28th 21:50 - Dec. 29th 07:31) taken with 
Cosmic_notracks[9,989,706] shows no problem with the hot tower
(eta-1,phi4), but shows the strange behaviour in the L2Cal Pass13 plots.

<!-- Comment: Sun Dec 30 12;52;27 comment by...kaori -->
I meant run 255577 (not 25577)

<!-- Comment: Sun Dec 30 12;56;39 comment by...Laura -->
I don't think there is a correlation between the two items. Same behaviour was there in run 255556 (cosmic run), taken 4 days ago, but same trigger table.

<!-- Comment: Sun Dec 30 13;02;31 comment by...kaori -->
Likely we don't get enough events, but we'll try physics table (shotsetup config.)

<font color=red>Shift Summary: </font><pre>Another no beam day. 
Tevatron cooldown began early this morning (0100h) (see update below) 
We fixed some problems, also identified causes of some 
problems as below. 
 
 
------------------- 
problem fixed today 
------------------- 
- TrigMon plot L1 Had Cal DIRAC Occupancy plot showed a hot tower at  
  eta-1, phi-4, which corresponds ADMEM 17 in PCAL01. This problem 
  was spotted by Carla last night.  During the evening shift last night 
  they observed that: 
    * Spike run and YMon plots do not show any problems 
    * Kwangzoo checked the corresponding ADMEM with QIETEST  
      and saw no problem.  
  During today's day shift, Kwangzoo came in and did "calib-and-download" 
  for all the PCAL crates. After that, this hot trigger tower problem  
  went away. This confirmed that the problem was caused by 
  memory corruption which was not detected by the usual QIETEST. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
problems found & still to be fixed, but identified how to fix them: 
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
- According to Kwangzoo, all the suspicious QIE Calibration results 
  in CEM/CHA channels which we have been observing since two days 
  ago belongs to CCAL08, scattered around the slots.  He noted that  
    +5 power supply value (a capture in central wedges e-log) indicates  
  lower than it should be (4.62V).   
  Mark Mattson confirms that this would cause the problems.   
  Mark and Kwangzoo have requested an access to fix the power supply on CCAL08. 
 
- Problem was found in TrigMon, L2CAL PASS13 clustering plots in 
  cosmic runs. Running in a shotsetup mode with the current physics table  
  (run 255624) showed that this problem is associated with cosmic tables, 
  not physics table. Tom Wright thinks that cosmic tables needed to be 
  recompiled to pick up the new Penn tau algorithm.

------------------------------------------------- 
Tevatron A4 Update: Sunday Morning by S. Chaurize 
------------------------------------------------- 
Cooldown began at about 0100hrs. This morning EE Support experts are  
completing tests to certify the house is ready to go and the Tevatron  
can be powered. If all goes well we will get permission to power the  
Tevatron by about 1000hrs today. Mechanical support still needs to  
complete the E0 bake-out. They plan to pull equipment at about 1500hrs.  
If the cooldown goes well we could be cold on the Monday owl shift and  
trying to power the Tevatron on that shift. There may still be a chance  
we can get a store in this year. 
(note: permission to power the Tev once cold was given around noon today).</pre>
