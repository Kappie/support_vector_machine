Is <a href=

this</a> still the case?  Are the Heart beats for the 4 muon systems and 3 SMx systems still grey?
<!-- Comment: Tue Mar 23 09;00;08 comment by...Giorgio + alison -->
<pre>Yes there are still some problems: the 4 muon systems still have not recieved any heartbeats (grey H) as well as 3 of the Cal nodes (CES, CPR and CCR).
I think these are the same as those seen over night.
There are no light blue HBs any more, only grey ones.</pre>
<!-- Comment: Tue Mar 23 09;01;04 comment by...Giorgio + Alison -->
<pre>Now the whole node is greyed out for those 7 systems not just the HB indicator</pre>
<!-- Comment: Tue Mar 23 09;08;15 comment by...Dale -->
Everything went grey when I ended the HVMon++ program (the HV monitor program for the Muon3 PC).  I started it up again (haven't closed anything).  I tried this once but I may have not waited long enough - trying again.

didn't work (HB status stayed grey).  A restart/reboot will work.
<!-- Comment: Tue Mar 23 09;31;03 comment by...Phil Schlabach and Dale -->
<pre>Restarted Muon3 - Heart Beat status is now 'pink' (it may turn grey at some point) - iFix and Muon3 are talking to each other fine (can control voltage, etc.).  We 'blame' iFix although the exact problem is not clear.</pre>

<pre>Monitor #14 (hooked to the LCD screen in rack 2RR13B) does
not dipaly the "camera/monitor" information correctly. This
is a problem in the PELCO system and would cost $$ to repair.
Since we do not use this display very often, we will probably
not fix this problem.</pre>

I have retired all old L3 decoupled trigger tables which used 4.8.4  
reconstruction code and replaced them with new tables made with 5.1.3.  The new tables are already written on the white board and have been tested over the weekend.  All of the new decoupled L3 tables are usable with both old and new DSP code.
