<pre>No Beam, but they are trying.  The CSL pager was called  
a couple hours ago, and have tried all known phone numbers, 
but they have not responded.  Getting poor response from  
that.  The BSC have been repaired, and we will page silicon  
if there is a store.</pre>

<pre>Just got a call from Darrin in mcr.  Says they lost 2/3 of  
the pbars in ramping.  The initial lum. is 10**29, so not 
high.  They will leave this store in until 6 am Sunday, then 
will drop it and do about 4 hours of investigation.  They will 
try to go to shot setup around noon Sunday.  Will do flying wires 
at 8 after the hour.</pre>

<pre>Quench at E0(?) lost the beam.  MCR called and says that they 
will do some studies.  They think they know why they lost so many 
pbars on ramp, and will do some proton only stores.  Then will 
go to shot setup tomorrow at 8am.  We are still trying to figure 
out why wcal00 is not giving us events.</pre>

Somehow, the ADMEMs in slots 16-21 are thought to be TOF ADMEMs. 
This is certainly incorrect. I'm not sure I know how to address 
this problem, recommend that the ACE page the Arnd Meyer or the 
DAQ pager to learn the reason for this.

I was called to look into the problems with b0wcal00. Nothing 
appears to be wrong with the configuration, all Admems are 
configured correctly and nothing relevant changed in the 
database. The last calibration/download apparently happened on 
7/25 at 10am. 
<P> 
I also dumped WHAD and TOFD banks of one of the runs (121906); 
data from b0wcal00 are present (at least pedestals).

This time the consumer finishes by itself. and got it in database (seen with DBANA) run number is 121912
<!-- Date: Sat Jul 28 23:21:48 2001 -->
Done with L2 tests.  Details in <a href= 
'/cgi/elog/det-system-elog.pl?nb=l2&action=view&page=13&frame=2&anchor=23:16:26'>L2 e-log</a>.  Release system to shift crew.

setting up a cosmic run.

We did a calibration run on the endwall calorimeter and looked 
at the results in DBANA.  Pedestals look ok - a little quiet, but 
like they are connected to the detector. 
Don't quite understand why the occupancy plots for wcal00 wedges 
are empty, as the hv is on, Arnd assures that the cards are  
correctly configured in the crate.  I would like to see a source 
or laser run done, so that we can see some > pedestal responses 
out of the detector.  Would also like to check the lut table 
contents.

<font color=red>Shift Summary: </font><pre>Well, we did get one run done.  Still have muon system hv 
problems, which Hyunsoo is looking into - he thinks it may  
be that the hv pc hard drives are full.  Also have not figured  
out the wcal00 occupancy problem.  </pre>
