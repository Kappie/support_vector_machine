<pre>Stacking... Now 61 mA. Plan is to have a shot setup when the 
stack gets to 80 (around 7PM). Silicon initially out, then 
will be integrated if all goes well.</pre>

We had an alarm from PSM, rack 1RR27I_1. I went downstair to have a look at it, but everytinh looked normal. It went back to green in IFIX when I was back up.

We had two voice heartbeat alarm in the last 15 minutes but nothing showed up on IFix. Could it be related to the fact we have a new version running since day shift? (see <a href= 
'/cgi/elog/elog.pl?nb=2002&action=view&page=1015&frame=2&anchor=10:03:48'> 
user link text </a>). 
I'll keep an eye on it.

<!-- Comment: Thu Dec  5 16;51;58 comment by...JFA -->
An other time. I'm looking at individual systems on IFix to check everything's OK.


<!-- Comment: Thu Dec  5 17;09;53 comment by...JFA -->
I talked to Steve Hahn about it and we noticed the High Voltage Summary below shows the heartbeat of Silicon systems as purple. I tjust disappeared now. With asked the silicon people and they say it is slow right now, but they were working on it and probably using a lot of CPU. They have stopped their work now, it might be just that.

<pre>We tried running with the 2400 in the xft00 crate. 
After running for some time with the software event builder  
the crate would hang. You can type in the console and see that 
the carrage return takes but there is not other text on the  
screen 
 
We put back the old crate controller in the xft00 crate and 
did a test run to verify that all is well. 
 
We then put the 2400 in the tdc diagnostic crate and took a  
run with sevb and additional crates. After some time it hung  
in the same way as when it was used in the xft00 crate.

The heartbeat of Silicon high voltage systems is frequently complaining in the last hour. Silicon people who were here say that the GUI is very slow. They try to restart it, but we just had an other alarm.
<!-- Author: JFA -->
<!-- Comment: Thu Dec  5 18;16;16 comment by...JFA -->
We exited the GUI again. There was still one java process taking 99% of the CPU. We tried "killall java" but it didn't kill the job. We paged Chris Hill who came and "kill -9" the process. It's running smoothly now.

<font color=red>Shift Summary: </font><pre>Started the shift with pbar stacking in progress, then 60 mA, 
expecting a shot setup by the time they got to 80 mA (expected 
at 19). They got 36 proton bunches in the machine at 7PM, 
then a TeV quench got them back in recover state. 
At 22 something finally started a shot setup with 100 mA pbars. 
Looks like Bill is getting all the action again... 
 
Apart from these occurrences, not much to report. Had some  
quiet time after the quench, did calibrations and cosmics.
