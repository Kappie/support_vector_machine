<pre>We end the cosmic run to take whatever calibs we can.  Max 
takes a few special runs for em-timing, including changing 
a few PMT voltages in central (as per Bob Wagner's instructions 
and Nikolay's (the pager carrier) OK). 
 
Then, L2_TORTURE w/ as many crates as possible.

Steve H turned on the HV for BSC1 by hand around 8:45.  When there is beam, ACNET beam loss variables such as LOSTP, B0PLOS, etc should now be reasonable.  We are still working on the HV monitoring pc for CLC, BSC, MNP, RP.

We have now tested the full trigger inhibit chain with the new system.  While the software does not yet have all the bells and whistles, it does perform the necessary function of displaying the status of the inhibits and allowing the ace to mask and unmask channels.  Steve Vejcik is going to speed up the refresh time and talk to Bill about getting the new code into the development version of fer. 
<p> 
Some care is needed in using the new system.  It does not yet lock out changes to the masking of channels when a run is active.  Also, the code does not yet recognize when subsystems are excluded from the partition and should therefore be masked.  Much of the code for that exists, so we hope to have these features working in the next few days.  Also, the response to clicking to (un)mask is rather slow.  Be patient. 
<p> 
Note that the new system is controlled from b0inh00, not b0trin00.  I think that b0trin00 still controls the muon camac.  If that is the case, we should probably change the name. 
<p> 
For the time being, if using the new system one can source ~jdl/csh/setup_tixpt.  That contains some handy aliases to set the inhibit masks.

<br><b>Proton Halo Monitors:</b> 
<br>Istalled delay cables and established coarse timeing 
for the proton halo monitors.  The timing is established 
for the protons to about 5ns.  However. the beam in the machine 
is currently uncoelesced.  This type of beam does lend itself 
to doing detailed timing studies/coincidence.  I need to wait 
until coelesced beam is delivered to CDF for further work.

<h3>Consumer Monitor issue </h3>

of the Consumer Monitor using the "proxy" window after only 15-20 attempts by the Proxy to restart the consumer monitor! It's motto: <BR><i>If at first you don't succeed, try again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again,and again, and again,and again, and again, and again,and again,and again,and again, and again,and again,and again,and again,and again,and again,and again,and again...</i> <BR> By experiement we have shown that the response time of Consumer Monitor proxy is about 1 second.

<pre>We are getting the following error when starting the ConsumerErrorReceiver:

ERROR: Cannot open file <$SMARTSOCKETS_CONFIG_DIR/unix.cm> for reading.
Connecting to project <CDF_DAQ> on <_node> RTserver.


It looks like the $SMARTSOCKETS_CONFIG_DIR environmental variable
is not properly passed to ConsumerErrorReceiver or not interpretted correctly...

In hopes of tracking down the suprious reset problem in b0imu01, I have connected its reset line to b0cmx01.  So "reset_crate b0imu01" will actually reset b0cmx01.  If the problem follows the cable, then b0cmx01 should spontaneously have problems and go yellow in ProcMon.  Please page me if there are problems with b0cmx01 (314-3148).  If it is normal sleeping hours, just send me mail and go to relay rack 1RR27C.  There you will see a black widget coupling two cables that look like those used for telephones.  Unplug them.

<pre>Heart beats purple wih CLC, MNP, BSC, and RPS.

Paged the BSC expert.  He said that they were actively working on the PC for the systems and that BSC alarm with beam is to be expected.  Because of the work we are not actively monitoring the HV of the BSC here in the control room and, in fact, it should be on.  For now we ingore the alarm and the heartbeats on the 4 systems.</pre>

<font color=red>Shift Summary: </font><pre>   
- COT at STDBY unless 
  &gt; quiet time 
  &gt; b-field ON 
 
- Silicon OFF unless 
  &gt; expert says otherwise 
 
- performed all calibs except PMT spike run; included some  
  special runs for Max for EM-timing; not all HV was ON for  
  these, so experts should interpret results w/ care. 
 
- 2 alpha tests performed by tom wright; he said "nothing worked" 
 
- after 13:30, no calibs in DB or log files written...  
  investigating 
 
Plan: 
- chappas will continue clock work until ~1900; intermittant 
  interuptions will occur 
 
- L2_TORTURE w/ all but silicon 
 
- pre-match board tests by eric james from 1900-2100 
  (will need L1 and L2) 
 
- if quiet-time, calibrations w/ detectors at nominal voltages 
 
Problems: 
  &gt; CEM east wedges 0,1,2 & 21,22,23 are empty in CEMLED; may 
    be related to SMX noise too; experts notified 
 
  &gt; intermittent GAM alarms due to CSP North - HV hovering near 
    threshold; experts notified 
 
  &gt; Jonathan swapped a couple reset cables; cf his entry above; 
    needs to get swapped back eventually
