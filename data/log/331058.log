The impact parameter distribution w.r.t. beam for these
runs (0.08, 0.21).  Width is ~280 microns.  Width of
distribution apparently does not depend on momentum.
I think I know how to eliminate spurious bkgd--stay
tuned.

<!-- Comment: Fri Nov  3 23;48;59 comment by...Andy -->
    This series of 4 plots shows that unhealthy-looking Landaus
can result from using low-quality tracks.  The track quality
may be greatly improved by requiring the track be stiff, and
that it point to the beam.  The beam position is located by finding the sine-wave in a d0 vs. phi plot.  For these plots,
I required the tracks to point within 500 microns (2 sigma)
of the beam position. Soft tracks are those below 600 MeV
(<p>=350 MeV) and stiff those above 1.5 GeV (<p>=2.5 GeV)
Making these requirements, something landau-like seems to emerge...

       The plots are not path-length corrected.


<!-- Comment: Fri Nov  3 23;50;07 comment by...Andy -->
My "average p" symbol was taken as an html tag; average
momentum for soft tracks is 350 MeV, avg. momentum for
stiff tracks is 2.5 GeV

<pre>Did two pedestal runs to complement the timing scans of 
last night.   
 
103239  Pedestal Run DPS Off ReadAll BW 4 
103246  Pedestal Run DPS On ReadAll BW 4 
 
Two more runs need to be taken on next shift; two runs (DPS On/Off) with BW 7. 
 
One mystery: 103246 is DEFINITELY DPS On (from HDWDB, 
direct chip query, and SVXMON plots), but Run Control 
thinks it is off (?!) in the bitstream.  It might be 
useful to keep an eye on this. 
 
Learned this lesson: don't use partition 4!

<pre>We are doing a gain scan. The DAC voltage is varied from 1.9 
V to 3.3 V, in steps of 0.2. Also we are doing a mask shift  
by 1. The run numbers start from 103293, in sparse mode, DPS on, BW 4, threshold 5. Some ladders are giving the right gain  
but we found that the following ladders dont seem to be right, 
as we see from SVXMon plots :  
 
C 1 3  A phi         |        C 2 3 A phi  
	 z     	     |                z

	 z 
Alan and Igor are here but we dont know the reason yet. 
We looked at the chip polarities for all the HDI's and they 
seem to be ok too.

<pre>Had problems during the gain scan with West phi 3 layer 4 
= b0fib02 hdi 9 ... cold start failed repeatedly regardless 
of abort+reset, partition, etc.  This is crate 1 slot 17. 
Opening a minicom window and rebooting the fib didn't help.

<pre>There are repeated problems with fib02 due to which run control 
has problems with cold start and everytime we have to do a power 
recycle on PS27. Alan checked the full PS status and found 
DVDD drawing a high current ~750 mu Amp. Could be due to that.

<pre>We figured out finally that the DAC values have to be changed 
after the cold start. We got reasonable ADC counts after that. 
Also the cold start init problem vanished after this. 
 
So gain scan run nos.. 103293 upto 103418 have to be ignored. 
We are trying to start a fresh gain scan, with DAC values  
1.9, 2.1, 2.3, 2.5. 
 
The Run Control crashed and we are trying to restart it.</pre>

<pre>Problems restarting the RC. So we have set the database 
back again to NN, DPS ON, BW 4. And giving it back to 
Main RUN CONTROL. Some good gain scan runs have been taken 
with mask shift 0. The comment to look for in the run log 
is : 
"set dac after cold start"

<!-- Author: Tania, Mircea, Alan -->
<!-- Comment: Sat Nov  4 07;45;23 comment by...SCN -->
<UL>
<LI> One consequence "setting DACS after COLD INIT" is leaving
on all DDRs, which can cause data format errors for ladders which
have noisy OBDV and should not be read out. It also leaves both
Clocks on, and may leave the Fib in a funny state in other ways,
causing immediate Done timeouts etc (at least that was my experience).</LI>
<LI> This of course is <B>not</B> how we will attempt Gain Scans 
in the final system, just something jury rigged for today.  Mary
claims you <B>CAN</B> do them in SVXDAQ, so I don't understand why that was not seen as an adequate solution. </LI>

<!-- Comment: Sat Nov  4 09;58;49 comment by...AFS -->
a) Can't do this with the main system<br>
b) It <b>didn't</b> cause data format errors;
instead, it got <b>rid</b> of a weird problem similar to
what you describe above, and<br>
c) There was no evidence that I saw that showed the Vcal
setpoint moving setting the DAC before coldstart -- it did
move clearly and consistently for all channels doing it afterwards...

<pre>Summary of above: 
 
We learned how to do gain scans -- however, apparently (as noted 
above), it is necessary to set the DAC _after_ the cold start and 
not before.  (Doing it before seems to cause West phi 3 layer 4 
to refuse to initialize, among other things.)  So although we 
wasted a bunch of run numbers trying to scan the gain through 
all mask shifts with the DAC-before-coldstart procedure, we did 
eventually show that setting the DAC after cold start does produce 
desirable results in all working ladders.  The range of Vcal that 
appears to produce calibration pulses above zero seems to be from 
1.9 to 2.5 volts rather than from 2.5 to 3.3 volts, except for 
one half-ladder that hung on at 2.7 V. 
 
We had to give the crates back to the CDF shift at this point, 
since they now have a track-based trigger working (see main CDF 
shift e-log).  We were able to take one set of all Vcal settings 
every 0.2 Volts form 1.9 to 3.3 with mask shift = 0, pulsing 
every 8 channels, before running into the run control problems 
that are mentioned above (eventually solved by Arndt).  If time 
allows, once these data are analyzed to make sure they are useful, 
we can repeat the gain scan procedure.  (Some automated code for 
changing mask shifts and/or Vcal values would be helpful here...)</pre>

<!-- Comment: Sat Nov  4 07;56;10 comment by...SCN -->
<UL>
<LI> Why <B>only</B> one ladder out of 17 fails cold init when 
you set DACs beforehand, since the code executed is the same for
all ladders.  Was this the last one you did or anything like that?</LI>
<LI> As for automation, of course that is planned, as the above method
of taking a gain scan is just "what we could do three minutes after learning how to make the TS + SRC cooperate using CAL INJECT".  The real lesson was getting the
TS to tell the SRC to charge inject at the right time, the rest
was an ad-hoc method of trying to use this immediately without the proper chip/fib initialization in place.</LI>

For BW2 we have hits in all the 4 buckets and quite 
a large no. of hits in the wrong bucket. 
 
ps files for these runs are under their corresponding filenames 
in the directory: 
/cdf/data05/s1/hardware/svxii/SiHitAnalyzer/tmoulik/psfile
