We try to take the calibration. 
We start the quiet time calibration first but maybe we cannot check the calibration because DB is not available.

- Dan Cyr enroute to continue campaign against TDCs in b0cot03 
  (was defeated yesterday by some combination of database and 
   PROM programming procedures; no reading yet on whether there 
   are actual hardware problems) 
 
- b0svt03 and b0svt07 are indeed still down, not expected to be 
  resurrected until after end of work continuing today.

Have just put CDF clock into "free run" (using internal oscillator) mode instead of "RF-Lock" (a.k.a. "Freq Lock") mode.  SVX/SVT would prefer the latter, but RF no longer appears to be delivered reliably in the 150-1000 GeV range; we were getting repeated "RF Missing" errors.
<!-- Author: Steve Hahn -->
<!-- Comment: Tue Jan 14 12;06;48 comment by...Steve Hahn -->
Since ACnet is down due to controls work today, cannot check T:ERING to see state of TeV RF.  Called MCR, they are trying to put together a schedule for us to know when we can return to "Freq Lock" mode.


<!-- Date: Tue Jan 14 12:14:50 2003 -->

When convenient, please close the current EH and start a new EH  from RC Partitioning Menu to pick up the latest version v1_08. 
 
Please report any problems. Thanks.

<pre>TDC Update : 
 
COT03 slot 13 Serial# 525 failed all attempts to recover (reseating - reprogramming frams). Replaced with spare from diag crate serial# 157 
 
COT04 : Jimmy, all cards were visually verified to be LVDS. 
CMX01 : reprogrammed slot 13 - ran 10 runs, without failing to cold-start.  
 
MUSC00 : Slot 11 was giving cold-start problems. Reseating+Reprogramming and chanting in front of crate appears to have resurrected this card.  
 
At this point - I think all TDCs are working!

<p>Willis and I worked on improving the plug HV situation.  We tried rebooting and removing power at the plug several times each on CAENs 10 and 12, without success.  Then we replaced bad CAEN card in slot 9 in CAEN 8.  Reconfiguring at CDFEPHV on the 3rd floor and restarting, CAEN 8 came back.  Also, to our surprise, CAEN 12 also came back.  CAEN 10 continues to be unresponsive.

Plug CAEN crate 10 will have to be replaced. It is not clear
what is wrong -- no error lights show up on the front panel.
We unplugged all the hv modules to see if one of them is pulling
the supply voltage down, but the crate still does not boot
up normally.

<p>Tried to put CDF clock back into "Freq Lock" mode, but despite <a href= 
'/cgi/elog/elog.pl?nb=2003&action=view&page=41&frame=2&anchor=12:14:50'>MCR assurances</a> we still are getting "Sync Timing" errors on the PCC.  So I had to put the clock back into "Free Run" mode.  I suspect the TeV RF is there but below 150 GeV; I can only suspect this since we have no ACnet.</p>
