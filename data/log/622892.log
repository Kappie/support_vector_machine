Cryo alarm: Watt Can MKS went up to .007. 
It is usually .001 - .002. 
The tech is pumping it out. 
Back to normal 5 minutes thereafter.

<pre>I swapped all the tdc's in imu00 into imu01. I reprogrammed all in imu01 successfully. Slot 11 of imu00 wouldn't program successfuly (ive had problems with that tdc before). imu01 is "healthy" and is now the "good imu crate". Imu00 should still work, but has no cards to readout.

<pre>ABOUT THE L3 NODES:
- the 3 processors nodes have just a purple color instead of
  light blue, but looking carfully they are processing
- on the contrary the one light grey is not working

-> the rate is just fine no need to restart the run for this
   processor node missing</pre>

<pre>About errors when starting XMon and TRigMon manually, which were 
reported by the previous CO: 
 
This seems to be because ssh from b0dap51 to b0dap52 connects to 
a user different from "cdfdaq" by default. I don't know why. 
 
b0dap51:21:~>setup ssh 
b0dap51:22:~>whoami 
cdfdaq 
b0dap51:23:~>ssh b0dap52  
    : 
    : 
 No mail. 
1:/bin/tcsh 
Using root compiled with default compiler (KCC_3_3) 
<b0dap52.fnal.gov>whoami 
iyutin 
 
When continuing the starting process of XMon and TrigMon in this 
account, errors occur and cannot start consumers. So, it looks 
like we need to logon to b0dap52 from b0dap51 by specifying the 
login name "cdfdaq": 
 
b0dap51:24:~>ssh cdf@b0dap52 
 
Then, the individual starting processes of XMon and TrigMon worked 
properly.</pre>
<!-- Author: Kazuhiro Yamamoto -->
<!-- Comment: Fri Apr 20 07;58;49 comment by...patrick -->
<pre>The problem was because user iyutin obtained a Kerberos
ticket under his own account while logged in as cdfdaq.
He was sent mail yesterday asking him not to do this,
but to use ksu instead. The startConsumers.sh script
attempts to destroy any such tickets, so is more likely
to work than just giving the ssh command to start the
consumer manually from the command line.</pre>
<!-- Comment: Fri Apr 20 08;46;46 comment by...patrick -->
<pre>Doing "kdestroy" before starting a consumer manually
from the command line should work.</pre>

<font color=red>Shift Summary: </font><pre>Uncoalesced  proton beam, Accelerator studies 
as we started run. 
 
The plan was to run 1x8_END_1[7,101] with 
silicon in but without (i.e. in autoaccept) 
level 2. However we had a lot of trouble 
starting up. L3 cleanup done. 
 
While this was going on, we let Dan Cyr run 
TDC tests on all the muon crates. Finished  
at 1:54 
 
Meanwhile, have gotten run going with  
1x8_END_1[7,101] without muon crates. 
Also unable to include crates b0fib01 
(contains layer 00 -  which is off), and  
b0xtrp00. 
 
A cryo alarm (Watt Can MKS) went off at ~1:05 
and was fixed right away. 
 
After Dan left, included muon crates. 
Getting  a lot of "busy time outs" from  
silicon VRBs. Keep going anway. 
After some time (and too many time-outs), 
however, decide to take them out. 
 
Around 4, we started running with a different tag: 
1x8_END_1[7,104]  (silicon still out) 
 
Then include silicon. Limped along with a lot of 
time outs and HRRs. 
 
Noticed, rather late in the game (~6:30) that 
L1_CMU_TRACK_1.5/1 rates , as reported by the TS 
are absurdly high. However, they do not show up  
in trigmon !? Problems with trigger crates? 
 
XMON dies frequently toward the end of the shift. 
 
We gave Jay Dittmann the XFT crates and a COT crate  
at 7:30 
 
About that time Nahn started understanding why the VRBs 
have been giving us trouble but was unable to 
communicate it intelligibly.</pre>
