run 138021 ongoing with 0_03[25,252].. fcal00 has been out of  
 configuration. Mircea said it's powered off. we have about 380k 
 events for now..

ok. after run ended, i checked the run conf. fcal00 looks to be included. it's really red in vxmon. no suspended job, says heap is corrupt. confusing. will look at it in a while.
<!-- Comment: Sun Jan 27 04;34;24 comment by...muge -->
fcal00 goes thru partition and activate regardless of its red status in vxmon..

Enormous spikes in losses and brads plots. 
I have trips of: COT, SVX, L00, TOF,CMU, CMP, CMX, BMU, CPR,CCR. 
They lost the beam. 
Everything put on STDBY (COT on low STDBY, silicon with an expert at phone).

HB problem was actually my  chromatic mistake: the High voltage summary screen was strongly "gaussed" and the STDBY blue color at the extreme left side  appeared to me as purple. The degauss of the screen cleared the fake purple.

<pre> 
Muge noticed the calorimeter's HV needs quite long time  
(~ 15 MIN) to come up to full voltage after Xe calibration. 
I checked on PISABOX that the correct  
processes were running 
and they are but a strange alert  
window is on: 
The frame is "Ifix system alert message viewer" 
and the message is "1/27/02 03:20:44  
!System Alert! The Alarm Queue 'SUMMARY LIST' has overflowed. 
 At least one alarm may have been lost." 
 
Looking at the GAMMA process window I notice an  
updating error message that say: 
"CDHCN Error opening \\.\sjy... 
cdhcn error: no error 
--------------------- 
SKIP CSX !!! 
--------------- 
The system cannot find the file specified." 
I sent a e-mail to experts.
<!-- Author: Diego -->
<!-- Comment: Sun Jan 27 04;42;40 comment by...fotis -->
<pre>The CHA/CEM/WHA HV is never off when you take a Xenon calibration. The readout is just stopped since you exit the 
pisa box processes. After the readout is restarted (end of the 
xenon calibration) it takes about 15 min to finish reading all three detectors. About the gamma errors you saw scrolling are normal for the time being so don't get alarmed.  </pre>

this is Rick's run. L1 rate was 78 Hz without beam. Well,
consumers were stuck at an old run and we got 38086 events trying
 to correct them. Turgan is looking at the recorded YMOn plot for
 this run but he sees no occupancy at all. i am checking the
 errlog and csl reports that whole events are received in stream
 8 and all are logged. will look into it more..
<!-- Comment: Sun Jan 27 05;06;06 comment by...muge -->
ok, so YMon file is there but looks indeed empty.Turgan says Trigmon did not even produce a file. it's my mistake not to check the monitors status before the run.. 
<!-- Comment: Sun Jan 27 05;35;29 comment by...muge -->
Ok! why as an ace, i was missing the point that i should have told the CO to switch to the cosmics tcl for the Rick's run before i started it? could this be added in the procedure so that 
it's not a step missed? so this run was not useful except the L1 rate value ( and except that it kept me awake scratching my head)..
