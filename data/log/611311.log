<pre>b0ccal06 hangs during coldstart, Peter reset the crate. 
Try another run. 
 
Saw many crates red in the vxworks window. 
b0ccal03, b0ccal11 heap error... 
Reset all the red crates.  
</pre>

<!-- Comment: Mon Oct 16 00;54;07 comment by...Peter Wittich -->
All of the following crates appear to have internal heap inconsistencies all of a sudden.
<pre>
ccal:
=======
02,08,09,11,12,13,15
pcal:
=======
03,07,08,09,10
wcal:
=======
00,03,04,07
clc
=======
00 (as if there were other crates)
</pre>
The error message says, 'Hear error : 'Internal INconsistency' at xxxxx (count = 224444)'.  The hex address appears to be in the address space of the 'Messenger' process, according to the 'SP' column which one gets when one types "i" at the vxworks prompt from one of the affected crates.</p>

<p>Note that the CMX tripped twice at this time, too.  Coincidence or conspiracy?</p>

<p>Strangely enough, b0vrb03 also is read in the vxmonitor window.  Heap is not corrupt on that machine.  Let's ignore that for now.

<pre>CMX keeps tripping. 
 
There is no CMX pager listed so we called the CMU pager. 
 
Instructed to put CMX on standby. 
 
Will try to bring it up periodically. 
 
We will continue to look for CMX pager number-- we are told 
there is one.

<p>Mon Oct 16 04:30:20  GAS... "Rack Differential Pressure" went into alarm. Auto Dialer called me at 02:13AM. I called x-2080 to determine what the alarm was. PTL was called and he said it could wait until later but the auto dialer had other ideas. It paged Dean Beckner and called me 2 more times. I came in to find Dean looking into the problem. We found the rack ventilation intake screen plugged with dirt. After cleaning the screen the alarm reset ok. Will deal with the auto dialer later today. - Bill Noe

<p>Running CLC LED calibration.  The file name is ar018ca4.0001.cal.  this is our second attempt - in the first one, it appeared that there was no ack from the CLC crate at some point, but I am not sure at which point, as there is too much text being written to the screen to be understood. 
<p> 
It would be useful if  
<li>the documentation for this calibration was linked to the ACE calibration page 
<li>the documentation mentioned how long this calibration takes, so we can tell if the run is progressing normally.
