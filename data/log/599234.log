Before beam we investigated a strange rate on the CLC ACNET page: 
* The West middle layer was showing a 500 KHz rate 
We noticed that the full DAQ (w/o SVX) was running so we asked 
the ACE to pause the run and the rate went away, it came back 
when the readout was restarted. So this seems to be a noise 
induced by the DAQ. We then unplugged the flat cable going from 
the transition board to the coincidence unit and the rate 
goes away, so the noise comes from the transition board and 
upstream. We couldn't continue to debug because of the beam 
in the machine. We will continue when there is no beam. 
We don't think this will affect the trigger rate because 
an East/West coincidence is required.

Vaia has finished.
Now CLC experts have finished rebooting their crates.

<!-- Date: Thu Aug 9 11:42:15 2001 -->
Successful store achieved around 11 am - pbar load about 29 mA 
equivalent - we are nearly ready to take data, BUT: 
 
  - Did not run with Si all night; why not?  We did a test 
    run to make sure everything works. 
 
  - Calorimeter LER constants were (since the beginning of Run 2) 
    being loaded into wrong channels.  Code now fixed, and all 
    calorimter crates rebooted to get the correct loading in.  
    However, the constants for this store are WRONG and we need 
    quiet time to fix this. 
 
  - CLC sees funny noise; reboot crate before starting run. 
 
  - Initial L about 5.8e30  
 
Here we go!

CLC having trigger rate problems.  The effect is that all outputs from the coincidence unit show a rate of ~200-400 kHz.  Normally 
these should be an order of magnitude smaller.  All boards show the same problem.  The hypothesis is that this is a problem with noise in the crate; rebooting the crate did not help.  The measurement of the luminosity may not be affected...still investigating.
<!-- Author: John -->


<!-- Date: Thu Aug 9 12:03:55 2001 -->
<pre>Mario found a problem with the LER values being loaded 
incorrectly: 
For example in central calorimetre slot 17 goes to 16, slot 19 goes to 20 
slot 21 goes to 19, slot 16 goes to 18, slot 18 goes to 17 
slot 20 goes to 21.  
This was due to the fact that the configuration message sent 
to the crate from run control was sending slots in incorrect 
order and the front end code was not protecting against it. 
We tried to take care of this in the front end code 
and rebooted all crates for the code to take effect. 
Since there was beam in the machine we could not dowload the 
calibration but we have to do this in the first opportunity 
of quiet time. 
The effect is in the order of a few % but there are channels 
with bigger variations. 
We need to find out how to correct the dat offline for this change. We havre some thoughts on how to do this.</pre>

Scraping began at 11:44 am, LOSTP rates were about 50 kHz, with spikes to about 100 kHz.  These have gone away but the base rate of losses is still about 50 kHz.

I just turned off the pulling of CDF_ERROR by the SVT 
Merger boards (intended to detect XTRP/SVT disagreement), 
so that we can simply watch the LEDs while taking first 
runs, without stopping DAQ.  This will take effect on  
next coldstart.  I can be reached at the SVT pager.

<font color=red>Shift Summary: </font><pre> 
Shift began with shot setup.  By 10:00 am or so the machine had 
a complete set of proton bunches, and by 11:00 am a full set of 
antiproton bunches (total pbar load initially 330 e9 on the  
monitor.) 
 
CLC saw what they thought were very high rates (200 kHz, about 10x normal).  They began investigating, taking down the CLC HV and checking crate power, etc.  Ultimately they could find no obvious problem, and the CLC seems to report sensible luminosities. 
 
Scraping began at 11:15 and lasted about 1 hour, at the end of which the luminosity was about 5e30 (saw 6e30 on display - this seems to have been transient.)  Losses were about 12 kHz/6 kHz.   
 
We began to run, or try to.  There were multiple problems with the DAQ, stemming from a flaky IMU TDC and timeouts.  During run start a L3 error appeared (Error fetching L3CalibTag) which was debugged later. 
 
Meanwhile the calorimeter group determined the error with LER constant loading, and tested revised code with a few crates.  In order to have the correct LER values a ful quiet time calibration is needed, and should/will be done at the next available opportunity. 
 
At about 1:30 pm a PSM error appeared, and traced to a 5V analog supply failure in CONWB_3, channel 3.  The calorimeter expert cycled the 400 Hz supply to this end wall, but failed to revive the PS.  Further investigations led to the conclusion that this PS needs an access to replace it. 
 
There were a litany of DAQ problems: reformatter errors, done timeouts, crate hangs ...without one endwall we get about 200 Hz, withj 10% deadtime using the PHYSICS_0_01[15,169] trigger table. 
 
BSC people worked on timing. </pre>

After further review, the CLC trigger rates were OK and in the right ratio to the measured Luminosity (was a silly mistake in
the calculation, sorry). We did have an unusual rate when no
beam was present and the DAQ was running. We will pursue this
when there is no beam in the machine.
