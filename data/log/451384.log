Summary of events  
 
Earlier this morning, Petra hit the silicon racks abort crash button which turned off power to all 
racks.    In so doing, this created (caused?) a severe error in that particular quadlog module.   
There are two easy ways to determine this.  One can look in the APACS page and look for severe 
errors.   QL puts out -0.78 volts when it means zero (so that you know it is working).   In t his 
case, I saw 0.0 which means that QL was latched in a bad state.  
 
 
To fix this problem, one needs to go to 4-mation and remove the latch.  This will clear this 
particular severe error.  
 
 
We were overly exhuberent and tried to reset this by reseating the card.   This is a no-no for a 
quadlog safety system.   The system is configured now to drop AC power, flammable gas etc if it sees 
an abnormal condition (reseating a card, forcing a variable in 4-mation etc).   Thats what happened. 
  We tripped off all colision hall power, tripped off flammable gas, tripped off solenoid, etc.  
 
 
Everything is now back up and running -- except solenoid which is now being pumped down.

<pre>HV status:  Hynsoo came in and started the CMU, CMP, CMX, BMU HV.  The CMX SE wedges 16&17 tripped, even in standby, so we switched them to off. 
The Plug systems expert called and I switched on the HV following his instructions. 
The CCal expert came in and put the CES, CPR and CCR systems to standby. 
Experts are working with the COT and TOF.  Their HV cannot be switched on until the Solenoid is on.</pre>
