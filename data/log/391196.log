Run Coordinator's plan is to have 3-4 hours of studies while they get the stash to 150E30, then they will initiate Shot Setup.  Looks like it will be somewhere around 7-8 PM.

The CDF Permit Control application gets stuck (while running on the other ACNET PCs). Do not know if related but this machine went blank on

<!-- Comment: Mon Jul 23 20;18;03 comment by...Sasha -->
It processes 3 events and crashes after that.

<!-- Comment: Mon Jul 23 21;06;47 comment by...Si -->
For additional information:

The Events Pending timeout may occur due to back-pressure, in this case it seems caused by some issue with the CSL. When level3 cannot pass events off, this causes EVB to be unable to pass events to the L3 converters, causing the timeouts.

<!-- Comment: Mon Jul 23 22;57;03 comment by...Pekka -->
L3 experts (Si Xie) calls in.  Suspects it is a problem with CSL.  We go through the restart procedure, but also page the CSL LRP.
<!-- Comment: Mon Jul 23 22;57;45 comment by...Si -->
Ace (Sasha) mentioned that the L3 display is green and purple. This points to a problem with the CSL due to hot trigger perhaps (this is more likely during cosmics, which was the case earlier tonight). We recommend cleaning up the EVB and seeing if the problem persists. If it does we recommend contacting CSL experts.

MCR calls to tell us Scraping complete.  While on the phone, LOSTP jumps to 50kHz.  They call back to report that apparently not all the collimators went to their appropriate positions, and that they are re-scraping.

<font color=red>Shift Summary: </font><pre>Evening Shift Summary 
 
Most of the shift was spent waiting for enough pbars to merit a store.  Highlights: 
 
1)  The upgrades to L2 were implemented by Gene and the default physics trigger table was changed.  We checked that L2Torture and Cosmics still worked. 
 
2)  The switch from SL3 to SL4 on the nodes used to download the crates was completed successfully. 
 
3)  We were able to get the ACNET Monitor running on 2RR03G – several front panel restarts did the trick. 
 
4)  Had another silicon cooling anomaly, with the chiller dropping significantly below the set point.  The usual sophisticated technique – a well-placed hammer stroke – brought the chiller back to sanity.  Experts are discussing next steps. 
 
5)   Had recurring problems with – apparently – the CSL.  Numerous times, runs aborted with CSL errors.  Also, DAQMON reported CSL problems that didn't appear to be there, based on the CSL Monitor and PROCMON.  Experts stated that the DAQMON reporting was not to be trusted.  So why do we have it here to confuse? 
 
6)   At end of shift, store has come in with high LOSTP rates.  We hand over to the owl shift.
