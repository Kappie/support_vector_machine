<p><b>Silicon Power Controlled Access</b> 
<p>Investigated <b>SB5W7L0</b> Bias.  Rebooted crate and it operated normally, reporting both non-zero voltages and currents. 
<p><b>IB0W2 Bias 3.0</b> responded to changes to its max current setting via the crate front panel--I suspect the problems of last night are from the GUI.  This channel does trip Ovc, however, when turned on.  Removed the cables and turned the supply on and it worked normally, i.e. the problem appears to be downstream of the PS.  I tried changing it's bias current sensitivity to the coarse setting, but it still trips Ovc. 
<p>By request I unplugged the remote sense cable from <b>IB2W2</b> and put in the jumper over-riding the cable enable.

in to fix the problem.  Unfortunately, the IMU steel was already

During today's access we checked (CONET-4) PEI power supply and found the +5V analog was faulting. I Power cycled the supply by switching  the breaker of the supply off & on  and the +5V ANALOG came back on for only ~2 seconds and faulted, then I reset it by pressing the reset button on front panel but it continued to fault. So then I placed meter probes on the load to measure the voltage level as I was resetting the supply and noticed that the voltage level was set @4.94V. I increased the voltage output to 5.15V and the +5V output seemed to behave just fine at this point. 
I also measured the voltage difference after adjusting the output @ the power supply output=5.37V  and @ the load =5.15  
the difference was ~22mV.  
We allowed the supply to run for ~1 hr. And it was decided not to change supply. So far supply is OK.

<br><b>Access Status:</b> 
<br> Dervin phones from the collision hall.  The cause of the 
power supply trips appears to have been the TOF transition board 
(TOMAIN?).  Replacing the transition board cures both the power 
supply problem and the transition board problem.  
<br>  
The IMU steel is closing and we are performing a TOF TAC  
calibration to check out the system.

Silicon work continues.  Steve Nahn is on his way in to aid  
diagnosing the problems.

<pre>Access Report of Julia, David, Rob, Cigdem: 
=========================================== 
 
Silicon is up and happy.  
We moved FIB and FTM of IB0W4/5 from slot 10 to 8.  
One PS is back (SB5W7L0) and one PS work did not work out 
(IB0W2L3).  
We had some troubles with the Silicon Detector aroudn 3:30am, which caused us not to be able to turn on the  
Silicon, because it was tripping on DVDD OC.  
We contacted Steve, Andy, Evah, Lester..... 
 
We investigated the clocks, they were ok.  
We rebooted the SRC and restarted the PS GUI.  
Which apparently solved the problem.  
Detector is up, we tested it and took some data with the  
whole system in RC and we are taking calibration data.
