<pre>Continue with controlled access with SVX cabling continuing in the hall.  Shower max PROM's will be replaced in all the boards.  Specific requests are: 
<ul> 
<li> Wall calorimeter (Steve Vejcik) for at least 4 hours 
<li> West plug for laser run (Deigo Cauz/Vaia Papadimitriou) for 4 hours 
<li> COT crates for shift (Jay Dittman) 
<li> CMX00 for shift (Trevor Vickey) 
</ul> 
We'll try to run cosmics in between. </pre>

<pre>Level 3 fails partition transition with incomplete start  
message on one of the connverters. It happened twice  
when I was trying to use all the subfarms.  
 
I've switched to 4 subfarms and unplugged the subfarms  
which failed before (c02, c06 and c13). It works.  
 
The problem is not understood yet.</pre>

Stephen Miller phoned in an update on the L2 crate.  The alpha board that failed has been swapped out with a spare, and Steve Kuhlmann did perform some tests on it yesterday.  Monica Tecchio is also planning to work on it today.  At some point later today, we should get an update on whether to include the crate in standard running again.

<pre> All triggers in this run come from hadron towers  at eta 8 and
 15, corresponding to the overlap between central and wall, for
 which the summing has been recently been turned on.  The wall
 crates are in use by Steve and not in RC, but apparently these
 towers are not masked. They are probably masked only if the
 central crates are not on. Will check with Bill Badgett.


 The plug em tower is not "hot", maybe slightly warm. </pre>

Steve Vejcik agrees to give up a few crates for TOF work till 2 PM (Matt Jones) - wcal06 and b0puls01.  Then it goes back to Steve till 4ish.  Nikolai is negotiating with Steve to power down some of the wall crates to get access into to one of the wall PMT's. 
<p> 
Jimmy Proudfoot called to see if he could get the central and/or plug calorimeters for some time this evening to test shower max readout.  Noted the potential conflict with L2 work that has to be resolved.
<!-- Author: Pekka -->



<!-- Date: Wed May 16 12:52:19 2001 -->
We have two requests for access to the calorimeter readout this evening 
<ul> 
<li> Monica Tecchio and the other L2 folks would need to have periodic runs to test L2 boards.  Monica doesn't expect to be around between 6-9 PM. 
<li> Proudfoot would like either the central and/or plug for at least one hour, preferably more.   
</ul> 
Suggestion is that we schedule Jimmy starting around 6 PM.

This was strange as yesterday it ran fine - by trial and error found out that tdc in slot 18 isnt happy with tdc test. It works with normal daq running however! In tdctest  - tracer done not set error followed by done timeout. Ill look into this tonight.
