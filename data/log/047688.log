<pre>Trigger inhibit on CMU, then also COT. 
They both tripped. Koji's ramping them up. 
 
HEY! trigger is no longer inhibited when COT is in standby!!! 
What's the point of the trigger inhibit if it thinks  
stand-by is OK? I pause the run by hand.

On the plug temperature control system, the circuit  
breaker for the AC power for the heat/cool TECA 
units for PMT boxes PE02 and PE03 tripped last night 
at about 9:45 pm.  I just disabled the alarms related 
to this, but the problem is not fixed.  The breaker 
need to be reset.  The only plausible suggestion 
so far as to why the breakers started to trip is that  
the toroid is creating a magnetic field at the circuit  
breaker box now that it is rolled into position.

Just ending the run takes several minutes :-( 
 
Ilya called (!) to tell that the L3 proxy died and 
that we should cleanup L3.  
 
We had to issue a reset to repartition due to the L3-cleanup.

Busy time-out after 40 events. HRR doesn't help.

Taking out both CMX crates and reset. 
 
Clicked on Partition too fast after Reset, so EVB got screwed up. 
Clean-up EVB.

Changing 13 prescales by hand at the start of each run is
very annoying, error-prone and we lose a few minutes of beam.

Run 118433 is a good run but ended with java out of memory and is not indicated as a good run.  
I send an e-mail to Bill Badgett <badgett@fnal.gov>  to have 
this fixed by hand.

<!-- Date: Fri Jun 22 14:26:27 2001 -->
<pre>We have been running fairly smoothly- in looking at everything 
have some (minor) questions and comments (in no particular order): 
 
1. The CSL logger display overwrites itself (text at bottom). 

2. We saw 13 MB/sec and 100 events/sec from the CSL and EVB displays; we're confused about the event size. 
3. CSL monitor window is VERY slow in coming up. We ended up with lots of little boxes. If you click `ok' on one of them it ALL goes away. 
4. We couldn't find the display for the CSL disks- could this be added to the CSL window? 

5. SVTSpyMon showed an old run number, so we didn't look at the plots- turns out this is a feature- it doesn't know the run number. We've requested that this field just be left blank. 
6. Event Display doesn't seem to show SVT tracks, even when they're enabled. 

7. Event Display - for online it would seem as if loop mode should be the default. Also having a tower threshold default of 0.3 GeV in Et makes it much clearer as to what's going on. 
8. Event Display- we tried selecting on L3 trigger bits, but it didn't seem to make any difference. 
9. XTRP download at coldstart is very slow- have we reverted to single word mode?</pre>

<!-- Comment: Fri Jun 22 15;44;27 comment by...patrick -->
<pre>Ace lesson number one:
As stated in the window run control pops up when there
is a busy timeout, the crate mentioned is most often
NOT the cause of the problem. This generally is the
crate with the largest amount of data. It sees the
upper level DAQ system clog up first. If the crate is
removed, then the next run will just give a timeout
from a different crate or set of crates.
This is in fact what happened...
It looks like a VRB in crate b0eb11 was in a bad state.
Cleaning up the EVB was necessary.</pre>
<!-- Comment: Fri Jun 22 16;53;48 comment by...patrick -->
The VRB was put in a bad state by work on imu01

Started run 118436. 
Deadtime was 60-70%, so I put in prescales. 
 
Oops, lots of BUSY-timeout.  
 
Doing 'check Scramnet' from L3 ACE controls it gets stuck, 
so I abort, reset and start a new run.

<font color=red>Shift Summary: </font><pre>Inherited store 549 with lum approx. 1.0x10^{30}. Took a long run, Run 118429, with SVX integrated: 520K events. 
 
Gave up SVX (reluctantly) to SVX folk. 
 
Took a run for Nathan Eddy and the 2-track trigger board. 
 
Back to (fairly) steady taking of data, without SVX. Typical minor problems with Java, RTserver, etc. (see above log). 
 
Run Control gives 72.5nb integrated, 19.6nb acquired at end of shift. 
 
Major comments: 
	1.We really could use higher thresholds! 
	2. Many minor annoyances - hope we can beat them down                one-by-one. (again, see above).  
	3. One good long run with (partial) SVX. SVT sees tracks.</pre>
