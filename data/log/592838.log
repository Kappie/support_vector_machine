CPR SE HV trip causes trigger inhibit.  Pause run, put HV back on.  
Followed by done timeout (from every system - looks like a problem with the RTXP)  HRR doesn't work.

Find few things wrong in the save configuration from previous shft. 
XTRP was OUT !!!! THis could explain why since run 118355 
(DIRAC pb reported previous shift) some trigger where showing  
0 for the DIRAC+Track trigger (see run summary). 
Also found that SVTMODE set to fake_default even tho' we had SVX 
in... I beleive now it should be default ALWAYS!!!  
<!-- Author: Anyes -->
<!-- Comment: Thu Jun 21 10;11;58 comment by...Peter and Young-Kee -->
<pre>Found that between 118334 and 118335 the XTRP was dropped from 
the configuration. This corresponds to RC crashing and being
restarted.  The saved configuration probably did not have the
XTRP crate in it.</pre>

<pre>At next coldstart L# report SCPU connect error.  
Clean up both L# end EVB.</pre>
<!-- Author: Anyes -->
<!-- Comment: Thu Jun 21 15;16;13 comment by...Ilya -->
  Note, that when Partition transition of L3 is interrupted
by Reset from RC, for the following runs Event Builder will
complain about SCPU->builder connect failures. Actually,
this appears to be a harmless message. To get rid of the message,
one needs to clean up EVB.

<pre>Kevin Pitts calls and reports that there were no 
track triggers starting in Owl shift.  This is

<pre>The problem with the Clock was that the Tev_RF coming out of the 821 discrimminator was unstable. In short, the triggering threshold was changed from -200 mv to -50 mv. This enabled the 821 to trigger more in the center of the Tev_RF's sine wave. This caused the Tev_RF output to become stable and thus the Clock was able to run without errors. The voltage supplies on the NIM crate were checked and the -6V supply is at -5.89V. I suspect that at the original triggering threshold of -200mv was just on the edge of the 821's triggering ability. Also, the -6V supply going to -5.89V could cause the 821 to become unstable. The Clock is now running without errors for over 30 minutes. I will adjust the NIM crate's -6V supply back up. I also left another 821 discrimminator in the above NIM crate to serve as a spare in case more problems develop.</pre>
