<P> 
The b0ccal05 crate has the BUSY line asserted true at <BR> 
all times, so it is hanging up when trying to send data <BR> 
to the VRB, hence the combination of busy and done timeouts <BR> 
experienced earlier.   Also, the serial line for minicom <BR> 
does not work on this crate.<BR> 
<P> 
I suspect <I>monkey business</I> to have taken place sometime<BR>  
this week on or near this crate.   Most likely reseating the <BR> 
cables and fibres would solve the problem.   If not, a tracer <BR> 
reseat may behoove us. 
<P>

...or cables were plugged back in correctly...  it's 
very unlikely to be a tracer problem.

First floor crates also now on vxcom instead of old minicom.  I'd appreciate the aces testing the connections for the new system.  Note that ethernet and power connections for the new servers are temporary.  I'll have to take down the system tomorrow to clean that up.

I checked all 120 or so crates in the list I was given. All cot, ccal, pcal, wcal and fib crates were fine, with the following exceptions:
<br> ccal12 and 14 were swapped
<br> wcal 00 and 01 were swapped
<br> pcal02,03,04 and wcal04 were unresponsive to vxcom; they are also unresponsive according to the VxWorks system monitor
<br> ccal10 was unresponsive but does not show errors in VxWorks system monitor

<br><br>For all crates named 'spareXX', the 'name or service was not found'.
<br><br>All other crates prompted for a password, eg:

<pre>Done testing XFT SLAM boards for the day.  
We leave the system such that all the SLAMS are installed and  
there are no errors on 10,000 event (no-track) events.  
 
No errors means the XTRP receives the same thing that the Linkers 
sends out, thus confirming that the SLAM is not f-ing everything  
up. 
 
We will check overnight on a 100 K run for errors in our offline  
TrigMon executable.  
 
Tomorrow, we plan on running the same tests but with linker  
firmware which sends sequences of real tracks in every linker  
every event.    This is the last test we need to do to confirm 
the SLAM installation is successful (in passthrough mode). 
 
You are welcome to the XFT crates.   
 
We'd like them back at ~8:00 AM tomorrow.

We are running cosmics with Silicon. The L2 cosmics rate is far too  high - 80 Hz from muons and 20 Hz from calorimeter. The CSL stream I is running at 25MB/s, which I believe is basically maxed out. Can  we find the source of the hot triggers?

In order to take data with the COSMICS_SILICON run configuration, I had to mask out the following trigger inhibits: CLC; MP; BSC; VMEPower; CPR, CCR; PLUG HV; RP; TOF HV. At Greg's suggestion, we also masked the flying wires, because we were getting those often.
