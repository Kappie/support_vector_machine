Some issues with web browsers on the Ace DAQ consoles. We closed the browser on b0control15 because bookmarks were missing. It would not allow us to reopen, because all profiles were in use. We asked JJ about it, he suggested that Bill's script for starting mozilla had not been run, and that we, for the moment, make a new profile (b0control15) and use that.

When we ended the run, there was a silicon pinkie, I think in SVX DVDD B0W3L3, which recovered when we started the new run.  IMon crashed (ran out of memory) and had to be restarted, so I don't have the history plot to paste.

<p>Both VNODE1 and VNODE2 had the wrong picture up for the

to the new ones; I thought I had done this earlier, but perhaps 
since iFIX was running at the time this did not actually work. 
This time I shut down iFIX while making the changes.  On VNODE1, 
I do not know why the wrong picture was up.  I would like to see 
what happens during a reboot, but I'll wait until we're
