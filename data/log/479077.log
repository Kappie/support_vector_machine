<b> Si post-quench checkout performed ? </b> there apparently was a quench of the tev on abort (or did the tev abort because of the quench ?) <p> 
if it was not done, please plot the BLM FIFOs and put them into the e-log (if they are not empty), perform a post-quench checkout according to these <a href=' http://www-cdfonline.fnal.gov/internal/ops/svxii/runii/quench.html'> instructions </a> and perform the pager carrier about the quench and the ensuing quiet time.  in particular the trip of SB2W2L4 can be studied. If quiet time is >30min, it would be also good to inform  in addition the detector WGL pager# 722 8740 david clark such that he could make use of the quiet time for studies.

Followed Rainer's instructions - went through config and got no errors. No pinkys - and the FIFOs llok fine. That is, today's date is not in the list of logged data, and FIFOs are currently empty.

<br>
Beam current and loss behavior for protons (left) and
antiprotons (right) as a function of time during the 
last store.  Note the monotonic behavior for the proton 
current (T:FBIPNG) and the erratic behavior for the 
antiproton current (T:FBIANG).  I suspect the structure 
for the antiproton current is an instrumentation artifact
as I can't come up with a scenario where we gain antiprotons
in the Tevatron. 
<p>
The proton and antiproton losses also appear to have a very
different character.  The fractional width of the proton
losses is considerably narrower than that for antiprotons.
Further, we note significant improvements (steps) in the 
proton losses when the E0 collimators are moved closer to the
beam (narrowing of the fractional width of the losses).  While
this doesn't appear to cause us (CDF) too much trouble now,
Muon chamber trips have been correlated with spikes in 
antiproton losses in the past.
<br>
<!-- Comment: Fri Jan 23 11;41;34 comment by...ronmoore -->
The problems with the FBI are usually background-subtraction related.  Try using T:SBDAIS (antiproton intensities using the SBD).

<P> 
12:11:34-   Attempting to load pbars. - ollie 
<BR>-- Fri Jan 23 12:13:19 comment by...ollie --  1st transfer away. It went INTO Tev. We are looking for it now in the Tev. 
<BR>-- Fri Jan 23 12:27:59 comment by...ollie --  It's in the Tev. 17E10 was extracted from RR. 16.9E10 made it to Tor902. T:IBEAM increased by ~10E10. It was 3 buckets early. Tev does not believe they can do anything with this & it would be dangerous to ramp & squeeze with this. They plan to get rid of this & transfer again. RR is only able to transfer 9 times, so we will be missing a transfer. 
<BR>-- Fri Jan 23 12:39:26 comment by...ollie --  Tev used the seperators to knob the helix (~40%) to scrape the Pbars away using protons........seriously.......that's what they did. 
<BR>-- Fri Jan 23 12:40:35 comment by...ollie --  RR still has 77E10. Is will, in fact, be able to do 9 additional transfers. <BR>12:46:41-  5.3E10 just made it into Tev (in the right bucket) 15e10 came out of RR. - ollie 
<BR>-- Fri Jan 23 12:54:24 comment by...ollie --  2nd in Tev. MI coalescing is ~50%. Looks like we're ~1 bucket off in coalescing. Experts are adjusting it. 
<BR>-- Fri Jan 23 13:01:16 comment by...ollie --  3rd away <BR>13:01:50-  Transfer 4 away. - ollie 
<BR>-- Fri Jan 23 13:06:27 comment by...ollie --  Long emit is big (~3x vs. Accumulator transfers) this is limiting coalescing. This was, of course, not unexpected. 
<BR>-- Fri Jan 23 13:09:11 comment by...ollie --  5 made it in. 
<BR>-- Fri Jan 23 13:11:06 comment by...ollie --  Transfer 6 fell out of MI. 
<BR>-- Fri Jan 23 13:24:16 comment by...ollie --  Transfer 6a (8th actual attempt made it). RR can only do 1 more transfer after all. 
<BR>-- Fri Jan 23 13:29:03 comment by...ollie --  Transfer 7 (9th attempt) has made it. RR has 1 more transfer in them. 
<BR>-- Fri Jan 23 13:32:11 comment by...ollie --  Transfer 8 (10th attempt) is in. This is all we've got. Gonna ramp & squeeze this.

From the run coordinator elog:
<P>
14:27:26-   To make it clear, the next transfer will be a standard one from the Accumulator. The Recycler shot was a dedicated study that produced some luminosity (a pbar tax rebate). We don't have any short-term plans for additional shots from the Recycler. - JPM
