Subfarm C15 is now gone.

C5 and C16 subfarms are now gone as well.
<!-- Comment: Thu Sep  5 05;23;10 comment by...Todd -->
In the end we also lost C5 before other unrelated problems with the event builder forced an end to this run.

Had SCPU_TRACER_EVENT_ID error but no orange window popped up with the info, as one did at 1:02am when the same problem occurred.  Noticed problem b/c L3 farm stopped.  Finally orange window w/"L2 Trigger rate dropped to 0Hz" popped up.  HRR seems to have remedied situation, but lack of orange error message is strange.

I looked at the error logfile.  The behavior was actually correct: only the 1st HEVB error should pop-up an orange window, and it did. No other windows are supposed to pop-up until the Busy TO error that usually ends the serie of HEVB errors. In this run, though, there were NO Busy TO at all. So no further windows showed up.

MCR called. They are having trouble maintaining temperature in a frig in the 'A' sector of the ring. Their experts are on the job trying to stabilize the temperature but they believe they could lose the store at any time.

Brief Gas Alarm sounded.<br> 
Cryo calls and says that it was probably caused by IMU bubbler being close to the top of its temperature range. He is going to the platform to investigate and will report back.
<!-- Author: Todd Huffman -->
<!-- Comment: Thu Sep  5 02;18;47 comment by...Todd -->
Cryo reports slow temperature increase over the course of the last week. He suspects icing up of the chiller.

Due to this plus the temperature of the alcohol bubbler I decided to page the IMU expert.

<!-- Comment: Thu Sep  5 02;46;44 comment by...Todd -->
IMU says that our programme is fine regarding the bubbler and gas. Basically wait for the store to drop and then begin the de-icing procedure. Cryo has been notified and is preparing for the procedure.<br><br>
Regarding the hot channels. This will require an access to resolve. IMU requests that we mark this run as 'bad' for the IMU.

After cople of more hours the high trigger rates are gone... probably statistics. Would be nice to add to the table an estimate of a statistical error, at least for low rate triggers

Actually there are few hot towers in calorimeters (not reflected in referebce plots in the book) see three plots shown above (from left to right : CEM PMT, CHA PMT and WHA PMT plots) 
The hot towers include: CEM 5L,-1; CEM 5R,1; CEM 5L,7, CHA 14LR,2; WHA 6L,-7

<!-- Comment: Thu Sep  5 07;53;55 comment by...k.byrum -->
Wha channel is suspected light leak and is known.  Will be fixed on a longer access.  CHA occupancies are similiar to reference plots (i.e. upper bound is around .22 so this is ok).  
<!-- Comment: Thu Sep  5 08;37;24 comment by...M Mattson -->
<br>
I assume that CEM 5L,-1 is a typo, that you meant CEM 4R,-1.  This channel has had a slightly wider noise RMS than normal.  (Enough that we are keeping an eye on it, but not a cause for concern yet.)  During the last access, we swapped CAFE cards with a neighboring channel, and the wide RMS stayed with the channel.  This leads us to believe it is not electronics related, but perhaps a mild connection or hardware problem.<br>
<br>
No information about the other CEM channels, other than to say that these might be normal statistical fluctuations.  If these channels remain "hot" over several runs, then it could be a pattern.

Problems with COT_08 crate.  Had to remove slot 3 (under direction of Mike Kirby) in order to begin another run.  
<!-- Author: Karen -->


<!-- Date: Thu Sep 5 06:36:45 2002 -->
<pr>So b0cot08 had done time outs, and it was finally bad enough to identify which card was giving problems.  the card in slot3 has died completely.  The card doesn't map during a cratemap, and when you try and read/write to the control register the response is completely random.  there aren't VME bus errors, but the value of the control register is random.  So the card was removed from the readout, and the crate put in local done mode (TDC_readout = 1)  There should be a request to have an access to replace the card.  It's in the lower NW rack, so should require only a 2 hour access, including the time to pull the north muon wall.  </pr>
<!-- Author: Kirby -->
<!-- Comment: Thu Sep  5 08;26;06 comment by...Wolfgang Wagner -->
<pre>We see 8 dead channels in the COT. That is probably related to 
the removed card even though I don't have a COT map to find out.
The dead cells are in SL 7 cell 360 - 368.
I will add a plot to the next shift log.</pre>

<font color=red>Shift Summary: </font><p> 
00:00 Shot #1728 <br> 
B0 Lum = 1.63E+31 <br> 
Running without silicon <br> 
Run 150990 started with three L3 subfarms out of the run.  
Eventually we lost about 1/2 the total number of CPU's before 
we had to end the run for other reasons. 
</p><p> 
01:40 MCR called indicating that they were having trouble  
controling the temperature on a refrigerator somewhere in the 
'A' section of the ring. They believed they could lose beam  
at any time and called to warn us. <br> 
We thanked them and kept running.<br> 
They never lost beam. <br> 
</p><p> 
01:50 The Gas Alarm sounded and then immediately silenced  
itself (no human intervention). Cryo (Jim Humbert) called and 
identified the IMU and NOT?? as the sources of the alarm due 
to a bubbler temperature almost being out of range. Jim  
investigated the situation in his temperature logs and also 
went to the gas platform. The history shows a slow temp.  
rise over the last week. No obvious signs of problems visible 
with the bubblers/chillers on the platform.<br> 
He strongly suspects that the chillers 
are partially frozen and need to be de-iced. This procedure 
takes several hours and should be done at the next gap 
between shots.  
</p><p> 
01:55 IMU has new set of hot channels. Approximately 6 channels 
in BMU West Cells around channel #100 are all hot. IMU expert 
paged and told us not to change anything regarding running 
and to mark this run as 'bad' as far as the IMU is concerned. 
IMU will need an access to debug the problem. 
</p><p> 
05:30 CO reports the following channels:  
CEM 5L,-1; CEM 5R,1; CEM 5L,7, CHA 14LR,2; WHA 6L,-7  
were hot in the calorimeter. 
</p><p> 
06:30 b0cot08 once again refused to come alive in run control.  
Kirby eventually traced the problem to slot 3 in the crate.  
He disabled it and we started a new run. COT will need an  
access to replace this card. Kirby wrote extensive explanation 
in the E-log. 
</p><p> 
07:50 IMU Gas alarm is no longer silenced (we just noticed). 
</p><p> 
7:59 B0 Lum = 1.01E+31<br> 
And a good time was had by all. 
</p><p>
