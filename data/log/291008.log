Expert is doing some work on central calorimeter crates, so he asked that they be removed from the cosmics run configuration.

TERMINATE: end test fram download

<!-- Date: Mon Nov 28 16:34:27.266 2005 -->
the b0ccal00 crate has been powercycled in order to perform some fram download tests. Will postpone further tests until work on the  boot files will be complete. b0ccal00 will need to be rebooted when the boot files will be restored.

<!-- Comment: Mon Nov 28 17;37;03 comment by...Lester -->
Does this mean that I can use all ccal crates except this one when running cosmics?

<pre>Level3 Testing:  
 
Checked that we can run the Level3 proxy from node b0eproxy01 in the EventBilder cluster (it usually runs from b0eproxy02). This took a little bit of configuration, but now it works fine. This is good, we now have a backup node ready in case of an emergency failure of the main Level3 proxy node. The system has been returned to normal state again.</pre>

<pre>Have recompiled a whole passel o' packages on the new  
/cdf/onln/code/cdfprod code disk, taking code from  
the CVS repository.    Below is a list of packages on  
the new disk;  if the date says 2005.11.28 next to the package,  
then it was recompiled today.     All CDF front-end crates  
have been rebooted.  I hope I didn't screw up too much... 
Apologies for the long entry.

So we finally paged L2 about the L2 Decision TO we've been getting all night.  Vadim called back and he initially identified the problem as coming from shower max (the readout for those systems are on the ccal crates).  Vadim claims that he didn't do anything, we just started a fresh L2Torture.  We then got a bunch of Done TO from Cot02,04,09 crates--Shepherded all of them and things were running smoothly.  Guram and I then decided to end the L2 Torture and start a cosmics run.  Shortly after starting the cosmics run L3 display went green indicating that there was a problem with L3/CSL.  Strange thing is that events were still passing through L3 and the CSL looked fine (total input rate was at about ~10 MB/s). Total deadtime on scalar mon was high ~88%. I ended that run, cleaned up L3 and evb just to start fresh, but the same problem persisted so we switched back to L2 Torture.  We then paged L3 expert Alberto who insists that it is a CSL problem.  I will investigate this

<pre>L3 Page
I didn't find any error/warning in the log files of some L3 machines. The fact that all L3 output nodes were working and sending data to CSL also indicates that L3 was performing correctly. I would make sure with CSL experts that the limit of CSL performance had been reached.</pre>

BMU access report:  Sunny and I investigated two HV sectors (NW24 and SE144) that showed noisy stacks. A couple of stacks (NW26-27 and SE150-151) show most of noise standing out in occupancy plots, but they spread over six stacks (NW24-29 and SE150-155) when observed signals with scope before TDC -- transition cards?  Both noise patterns look like the ones caused by small HV sparking and when examined with portable HV supply, small sparkings were evident in both cases.  The culprit stacks (NW26 and SE151) were isolated by taking Xend jumper out and HV boards were replaced.  We will watch over those two other HV sectors (NE12 and NE60) which used to trip many times recently.

While running L2Torture I noticed that the Runsection number in RunControl was updating at an unusually fast rate (I'm not even sure if this number should be advancing during L2Torture).  If you look at run number 207860, the number of the runsections is ~60k.  We paged DAQ and he agreed that this was strange.  He suggested that we start a new RunControl session and restart CSL. I had to issue a cslcom cleanup because not all processes had stopped after issuing a cslcom stop command.  We then started a new run, but the problem with the advancing RS persists with the current run (207864). The DAQ pager does not know what's wrong, but he thinks this is not an urgent problem and it can wait until morning.
