  [PATCH] Make readahead last page of file
  
  hi marcelo-
  
  i posted this a while back on fsdevel for comments, but never heard
  anything.  i'd like this patch to be included in 2.4.24, as it improves
  NFS client read performance by a significant margin, and doesn't appear to
  have any negative impact (see fsdevel archives for benchmarks).  this is
  against 2.4.23.
  
  generic_file_readahead never reads the last page of a file.  this means
  the last page is always read synchronously by do_generic_file_read.
  normally this is not an issue, as most local disk reads are fast.
  however, this means that the NFS client is never given the opportunity to
  coalesce the last page of a file, which must be read in a separate
  synchronous read operation.
  
  this is especially honerous if the network round trip time is long, and/or
  the workload consists of reading many uncached small files.
  
  i also explored changing the way that generic_file_readahead computes the
  index of the last page of the file.  the fix below appears to be the best
  solution.

  [PATCH] 2.4.23 update Documentation/Changes for quota-tools
  
  This patch updates Documentation/Changes for quota-tools.
  
  This information may be needed by those wanting to use the new quota
  code (CONFIG_QFMT_V2) which went in about 6 months ago.
  
  The patch to update ver_linux for quota-tools was applied 5 months ago,
  but this part slipped through the cracks somehow.

  [PATCH] ac97_plugin_ad1980 fixes
  
  Hi,
  
  I have a MSI875P Neo motherboard which includes an AD1980 codec.
  I tried to use ac97_plugin_ad1980 as a module, but it failed to load because of a GPL issue. I had to add a MODULE_LICENSE("GPL") to make it work.
  Also, I had to force the ADI compatibility mode to have the switch input/ouput working.
  Now, it's working perfectly.
  Here is the diff -u with kernel version 2.4.23

  [PATCH] fix some DRM43 warnings
  
  [Resend. Was ignored for 2.4.23-pre :-(]
  
  This patch fixes three sources of warnings in the new 4.3 DRM code:
  - drm_os_linux.h has a #warning on broken list_entry usage.
    The patch backports a fix from the 2.6 code.
  - radeon_drv.h has a #warning PCI posting bug.
    The #warning refers to an obsolete and unused macro.
    Simply remove it. It's also gone from the 2.6 code.
  - drm_agpsupport.h generates a gcc warning on an assignment
    used as a truth value.
    The patch backports a fix from the 2.6 code.
  
  These changes are well-tested: they have been in 2.6 for ages,
  and I've been running them in 2.4.23-pre/rc for months.
  Please apply.

  [PATCH] Make root a special case for per-user process limits.
  
  This is needed because when a setuid-root program calls
  setuid(0) to become really-root, p->user becomes root_user,
  but ->rlim stays as the original user's limit, and now
  the process cannot fork - becuase root has more processes than
  the original user had.
  
  The real problem is that NPROC is not really a per-process limit,
  but its a per-user limit, and including it with the rlim structure
  was not a good idea :-(
  
  This fix is already in 2.6

  [NETFILTER]: Fix expectation evict order
  
  This patch fixes the order in which expectations are evicted when a helper
  specifies IP_CT_HELPER_F_REUSE_EXPECT.  Prior to that patch, each new
  expectation is added at the beginning of the masters sibling list.  When
  max_expected is reached, the first non-established one on the list is reused
  (which gave LIFO behaviour).
  
  The patch
  - adds new expectations at the end of the masters sibling list
  - uses list_for_each_entry for finding the oldes one
  - changes nat core to walk backwards throuth the sibling list when calling
    nat helpers

  [NETFILTER]: Fix various issues with the amanda conntrack+NAT helpers
  
  ip_conntrack_amanda:
  - udp checksum checked even if not set
  - memory not validated to be inside packet at all or validated like
    this: if (*data and data < data_limit)
  - would create expectation with port 0 which makes nat-helper throw away
    packet (which makes exploiting the race-condition trivial even on UP)
  - expectation had no mask.src.* set so connections were accepted from
    anywhere
  - helper_unregister called after failed helper_register
  
  ip_nat_amanda:
  - drops packet if amanda_data_fixup fails without clearing the offset
    field in the expectation which is used as a flag to indicate that the
    current packet needs mangling. Problem arises from the fact that the
    conntrack helper creates multiple expectations at once and even if it
    clears the offset field for the current expectation the following
    expectations will not have it cleared and will mangle the next packet
    they see.
  - same unregister after failed register problem
