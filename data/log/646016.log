<!-- Notes: -->
<pre>Tev studies started at 15:00, expected to last for &gt; 4 hours, 
then a shot setup. 
 
RR = 193E10, Stack = 0. 
 
So, we can have the first store after the access sometime during the eve shift.</pre>

<pre>From Run Coordinator e-log: 
--------------------------- 
 
14:30:58-  
 
Tevatron Delays and Approved Studies: 
 
    * Tevatron 
          o Tevatron had T:B0Q5 trip off during the squeeze caused by the DC lead flow being too cold.   Another dry squeeze was required as well as warming up the lead flow.  The lead flow warm up was taking longer than expected and is not quite done. 
          o This delays the Tevatron schedule and ensures that we will have our target quantity of pbars for the shot.  
          o We do not have an estimate for shot setup yet, but it will probably be on the evening shift. 
    * Pbar 
          o Beam sweeping studies.  These are mostly parasitic, buy may impact the reading on M:TOR109. 
          o Stacktail measurements:  Require one hour of not stacking with very little beam in the Accumulator.  We can complete these studies after the next set of transfers. 
          o Lets set a maximum stash size of 250e10 in the Recycler.  We will leave any additional pbars behind in the Accumulator. 
    * Main Injector:   As time allows, we will also open up the possibility of some of the Main Injector studies, especially during the stacktail measurements. 
          o 120 Gev lattice on $29 cycle to the Main Injector dump (2 hours).    
          o Barrier bucket studies on the $2E cycles (2 hours). Experts changed the Booster event on the required TLG module from a $13 to a $1C, which eliminates the incompatibility with SY120 operations.

<pre>Plan: 
----- 
16:18:45-  
 
The Collider Plan:   Finish fixing the Tevatron and go into HEP shot setup. 
 
    * Pbars 
          o We will want a maximum of only one more set of transfers to the Recycler before our Tevatron shot.   If there are any additional pbars, leave them behind in the Accumulator. 
    * Before Shot 
          o Tevatron experts get as long as they need to parse the squeeze, and get the Tevatron ready for shot setup. 
          o Follow any directions left by Tevatron experts for getting into shot setup. 
    * Shot Setup Guidelines: 
          o Protons:  
                + 275-295E9 per bunch in the Tevatron at 150 GeV, unless Tevatron experts request a different amount of beam. 
                + Look for longitudinal bunch length in the Tevatron at 150GeV to be less than 3.0 nsec.  
          o Recycler: 
                + Follow the suggestions given in the Recycler Collider Shot Guidelines. 
    * After the shot 
          o Resume iterations of stack to 50mA and transfer to Recycler. 
          o Keep timelines optimized, and maintain proton beam efficiency and intensity through the accelerator chain.

<h2> SVT work</h2> 
 
 We redid the test of new GB firmware to check the BC mismatches  
between VME backplane and End of Event word. We had good  
progresses 
using teststand (tstsvt1), fakehits (SVT local), and cosmic ray run however, we should solve some issues before installing  
although the feeling is close to finish our task.<br>

Vadim couldn't get anybody to come in, he navigated me to check L2 decision node but we couldn't log in. He asked me to reboot it and now we are starting run to see whether things are working again.

Just to keep people outside informed, Tevatron experts are still doing checkout and tuning of the Tevatron. In addition MCR just finished another set of transfers to Recycler, so my personal estimate is that we will not get beam earlier than in three hours, but will probably take longer. I will keep you informed.

<pre>We looked into why YMon was crashing some more with cosmic runs. 
YMon crashes at:Consumer/YMon/CESDMonitor.cc:485  
(see cdfsoftb0 e-log for more details). 
Unfortunately, this problem is intermittent. At a moment, 
6.1.4ar version YMon crashes on b0server06 (YMon runs on this 
node normally), but the same version YMon does not crash when  
we run it on a different node.  For now, we set YMon to run 
on a spare machine, b0server11.  
No need to call consumer monitor pager tonight, when a store 
comes in.  Tomorrow, we plan to change monitors to the new  
version for TrigMon people.

We checked with MCR and they still do Tevatron studies which still might take couple of hours, so no idea when shot-setup will be.

16:00   Proton is back in TeV since 15:00. 
	They will do studies for &gt;4 hours, then a shot setup. 
 
	RR = 193E10, Stack = 0. 
 
17:15	SVT experts (Kubo, Maruyama) use the crate for tests. 
  
18:10	Kaori and Nakamura check consumers with cosmics. 
 
18:35	Paged L2 Pulsar expert. No answer, so called Vadim cell. 
	He says somebody has to come in to investigate. 
	After a while, ACE fixed it with Vadim on the phone. 
	Expert came in as well. 
 
19:30	More than 4 hours have passed since they started Tev studies,  
	and still going. 
	RR = 226E10, Stack = 10 mA. 
 
19:45	Consumers (YMON) are ok. No need to page at the shot setup. 
 
20:10	Called MCR to check the status. They are still doing Tev studies. 
	May take another couple of hours. 
 
21:35	MCR calls. Shot setup. 
 
21:40	All protons are in. Now anti-protons. 
 
23:25	Store 5328 is in. Lum = 198E30, TevPR = 8927E9, PB = 2070E9. 
	Losses are ok; HV is up, including silicon. 
	Emily is doing trigger tests. 
 
23:59	Have set up a pretty decent store for the owl shift.</pre>
