Today's Tasks from 8AM Meeting
==============================
L1       -  Greg Field work on system, including "bit-15" problem
L2       -  Monica coming in to work on problems:
            works OK @ 100 Hz  fails @ 1000 Hz
            Also Kuhlmann wants to do ReCes work.
L3       -  working onf "private version" problems with display
            Constraint:  can debug this morning, but a working
            version of L3 must be back in system by noon for DAQ check.
Silicon  -  "Rescued" several laddars yesterday
            Lengthy discussion of "drip" & ice problems in coll. hall.
            Count of wedges up = 78  
            (?? including 13 to be  brought up today)
COT      -  Want to take all crates for ~15 minutes to do final
            test before closing.
CAL      -  Aces need to ensure that calibration runs end properly,
            even when run has abnormal end.  Otherwise subsequent
            runs are screwed up.
            Need to re-install scaffolding in pit to fix light leak.
            CAL triger wait software needs re-installation.
Muons    -  CMP bottom died.  Fuse blown on low voltage.
            they will close up this morning.
TOF      -  Installation 3/4 done.  Errors in calibrations need
            expert help.

Aces     -  Run cosmic rays with whatever fragments of system
            are available until noon.  Then start integrating
            everything back into the system.

All keys should be returned by 2PM.  Search & Secure at 5 PM.

<pre>Replaced the TS in partition 1.  This partition 
should be completely healthy now.  We request that 
the shift crew please test this partition out today. 
In particular, this partition should be tested for 
the various calibrations.   Thanks.

I replaced fer/run control with a new built, compiled from 
scratch. No problems expected, just a warning...  
<!-- Author: Arnd -->


<!-- Date: Tue Jul 24 09:38:10 2001 -->
<pre>There is a good chance that the problems with monitoring 
programs on b0dap57 on owl shift were due to things being 
accidentally configured to run the daqmon programs with the 
version of java being used to track OutOfMemory errors in 
the main run control. This version appears to use much 
more CPU time, so with several CPU intensive daqmon 
programs on b0dap57 they did not appear to process the 
smartsockets messages very promptly. 
Until the fer table file it is fixed later this morning 
if one wants to start a new copy of the Level 3 display 
then create a new window, do "setup fer", then do 
"java rc.l3mon.Display"</pre>

<pre>SMX work: 
  We take ccal08 to study the wire preamps in East Phi=0. 
 
  The HV to Wedge East 0 has been disconnected since Jul 12 
and all 32 wire channels associated with SMX 2 still look 
alive.   Yesterday at 4:51 pm (Jul 23), we returned this 
voltage to Standby.  We then toggled the Voltage to on and 
standby several times and wrote a pedestal file with each 
configuration.  The preamps all still look alive at  
this point and we left the HV on.     
 
  Today, at 10:00am, we discover 3 of the preamps 
are dead.   We have a protection circuit to install 
(if it makes it here before 2pm).</pre>

The code for reloading the Level 3 tag information is now in  
place.  The problem had been a class that I thought was reloading  
was not. 
 
So, "this time fer sure", you should not have to restart the 
Run Control for new level 3 tag sets.

<pre>   I have taken over Boris's L3 work. I have cleaned  
up all systems by hand (were in somehwat of disarray) 
and had to reboot one output node b0l3u01. After that 
we had no problem starting the run. 
  At this time we started official version of L3 display 
from the command line, according to Jim's instructions. 
It works normally.</pre>

Nathan Eddy working on it.</pre>
<!-- Author: Andras -->


<!-- Date: Tue Jul 24 13:24:23 2001 -->
<pre>TOF QiePed Consumer updated, we are using the same consumer used  
by the calorimeter folks. We also found a bug on the  
shell script launched by Run Control. Issues addressed:  
 
The consumer ends automatically after the active transition ends  
 (it is worth to have the proxy consumer display open to see when  
 the consumer finishs sending the data)  
 
The calibrations can be downloaded.  
 
The consumer is going to be compatible with the new sevb.  </pre>

<!-- Date: Tue Jul 24 13:35:01 2001 -->
<pre>   We had one successful run with L3, but I asked 
to stop in order to switch to a newer version of L3. 
This version had been in use until last owl shift, 
but when L3 Display troubles started, Boris has switched  
to the older version. </pre>

<pre>02E is green again, but 23E, 22E are red and 18E-21E are 
magenta (communication problem). All of the alarmed ones
have a lower fan problem (values lower than 100%, however
one of the was red with a value of 99%, while there are some
greens with 98%!!!). 22E has also -5 V CMU at -25V!!!
Mike Lindgren is around and he is going down to check it
with Karen Byrum.</pre>

	L00 gas cooling tripped, leading to sono alarms 
and iFix horn alarms in control room.  L00 sono 
silenced. 
<P> 
	As all enables were ACTIVE at time of cooling 
trip, all 8 racks also went down on the cooling trip; 
leading to another source of foghorn iFix alarms in 
control room.  As the racks were down, iFix lost  
communication to the power supplies (which were off). 
This led to happy singing birdie alarms in the 
control room. 
<P> 
	Cryo reset L00 gas trip.  
<P> 
	L00 gas then tripped again, this time  
accompanied by two SVX cooling lines.  Silicon 
sono alarm came on and was silenced.  Racks  
naturally stayed down.   
 
	Cryo reset trips, then  
brought up rack (after required 10 minute  
waiting period).   
<P> 
	Acknowledged iFix alarms in control room 
(clearing both the birdy alarm and the sono alarms),  
then unsilenced sono alarms.
<!-- Author: ADF -->
<!-- Comment: Tue Jul 24 15;09;05 comment by...ADF -->
In this case, there was
<UL>
<LI>A cooling alarm
<LI>An iFix alarm indicating loss of communication with
power supplies
<LI> NO GUI on monitor (due to other SVX work going on)
</UL>

<P>
Cooling + GUI = Crash
<P>
This is exactly the situation in which, if there is
not a silicon expert <i>right there</i>, you (the Ace) 
should be hitting the <b>crash button</b>.

<pre>Tried to begin a "Rick" run with the calorimeter/trigger 
using partition 1, with the TS Greg installed earlier. 
A BUSY timeout occurs immediately on activate. 
Looking at the event builder statistics, it claimed it 
saw zero events, the evb had been cleaned up before this run. 
Looking at the TS statistics, they claimed the TS 
generated some events, however, the Trigger Manager claimed 
it saw zero events. 
We switch to partition 0 and the system runs WITHOUT 
any cleanup of the EVB, L3, or Trigger Manager.</pre>

<pre>&lt;pre&gt;SMX  work   - 
 
We swapped the preamp wire cards (ch 0-31) on West Phi=15 
which were dead.   We installed a protection circuit 
between the signal cable and the input to the preamp for 
these channels.   &lt;/pre&gt;</pre>

<pre>SMX  (shower max) work continued - 
We notied that calibrations taken at noon showed  
east phi=21 failing.   Using Voltman, we observed 
the +7.5V sagging.  We verified this at the detector 
and swapped the +7.5V rabbit supply for East Phi=21. 
 
Calibrations looked ok afterwareds. 
 
We also looked at the connections for the monitoring 
of the SMD crates for east phi 0-1, and 18-23.  These  
are all daisy-chained together and phi 0-1, 23-22  were 
giving alarms while the readout to phi 18-21 was broken. 
We pushed on connectors to the readout for phi=21. 
afterwards it all worked.   </pre>

Report from today's fred/scaler tests: 
<p> 
Irregularities in the scaler counts were also  
seen in the FRED data in the TFRD bank. 
The timing on one of the glitchy channels 
looks pretty good on the scope as can be seen 
<a href= 
'/cgi/elog/det-system-elog.pl?nb=tsi&action=view&page=2&frame=2&anchor=14:52:15'> 
here. </a>  
Not able to catch the board in the act of glitching. 
One  observation today was that a couple of channels did 
not count at the beginning of the run and then came alive. 
Will try to look more tomorrow.  Had to surrender the crates 
today for other tests.
