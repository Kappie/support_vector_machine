NOTE: To be able to see the last DBANA plot for 
TOFQIEPED first you must view any of the calorimeter plots, 
and also one of the previous TOFQIEPED plot.

Should be checked with the SVX in the run  
as soon as possible.  (Siliconers are now monopolizing their

We stopped the run, Carla seems to be happy with L1 output (if the problem with level1_cal_04 crate comes again, we need to page her).

Ilya and Nuno are going to reboot level3 farms, it should take about 2 hours.

Tony and Hiro are restarting CSL at the same time.

<pre>I am done with the rebooting (and filesystem check) of the Level 3 farm. This time we actually rebooted it twice in a row, and the results were that 2 nodes (b0l3192, b0l3198) failed in the first rebooting, and none (as expected) in the 2nd. 
Level 3 is available again.</pre>

With Bob Handler replaced BMU-W-100 and BMU-W-101 pre-amp boards. 
Oscillation went away, but causality questionable.  Also 
replaced BMU-W-286 and BMU-W-287 pre-amp boards to fix another 
oscillation that was bad last week but had gone away.  Also, 
replaced two certainly dead PAD's on BSU-W-10/11R and BSU-W-32/33R.

All consumers died earlier (not sure of the time).  I contacted Kaori and she tells me that the probably cause was the CS/L stopping and restarting, which apparently did occur earlier.

<pre>   Level3 failed Partition. It turns out that our attempts 
to restore one processor node (b0l3044) brought down another 
(b0l3036), for some reason automatic recovery script did 
not set up IP properly. We now marked this node (036) offline 
just in case.
