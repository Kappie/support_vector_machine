  [PATCH] irq safe gendisk_lock
  
  Hi,
  
  There's a problem with gendisk_lock in 2.4 right now - it never disables
  interrupts, but io completion stat updates can grab the lock from
  end_that_request_last -> req_finished_io -> locate_hd_struct ->
  get_gendisk. So make the lock irq safe so we don't risk deadlocking with
  eg people doing add_gendisk(). This race has been seen and traced in
  real life.

  [PATCH] RAID1 error handling locking fix
  
  OK, basic problem is that if you use mdadm to fail a device in a raid1
  array and then immediately remove that device, you can end up triggering
  a race condition in the raid1 code.  This only shows up on SMP systems
  (and the one I have here which is a 2 physical, 4 logical processor
  system shows it very easily, but for some reason nmi_watchdog didn't
  ever help and the system always just locked hard and refused to do
  anything, so I didn't have an oops to work from, just a hardlock).
  
  In the raid1 code, we keep an array of devices that are part of the
  raid1 array.  Each of these devices can have multiple states, but for
  the most part we check the operational bit of a device before deciding
  to use it.  If we decide to use that device, then we grab the device
  number from the array (kdev_t, aka this is the device's major/minor and
  is what we are going to pass to generic_make_request in order to pass
  the buffer head on to the underlying device).
  
  When we fail a device, we set that operational bit to 0.  When we remove
  a device, we also set the dev item in the struct to MKDEV(0,0).
  
  There is no locking whatsoever between the failing of a device (setting
  the operational bit to 0) and the make_request functions in the raid1
  code.  So, even though it's safe to fail a device without this locking,
  before we can safely remove the device we need to know that every
  possible context that might be checking that operational bit has in fact
  seen the failed operational bit.  If not, then we can end up setting the
  dev to 0, then the other context grabs it and tries to pass that off to
  generic_make_request, unnice things ensue.
  
  So, this patch does these things:
  
       1. Whenever we are calling mark_disk_bad(), hold the
          conf->device_lock
       2. Whenever we are walking the device array looking for an
          operational device, always grab the conf->device_lock first and
          hold it until after we have gotten not only the operational bit
          but also the dev number for the device
       3. Correct an accounting problem in the superblock.  If we fail a
          device and it's currently counted as a spare device instead of
          an active device, then we failed to decrement the superblocks
          spare disk count.  This accounting error is preserved across
          shutdown and restart of the array, and although it doesn't oops
          the kernel (the kernel will refuse to try and read beyond disk
          26 even if the spare count indicates it should, although I'm not
          sure it doesn't try and write past 26 so this could be a disk
          corruptor when the spare count + active counts exceeds the
          amount of space available in the on disk superblock format) it
          does in fact cause mdadm to segfault on trying to read the
          superblock.
  
  So, that's the description.  Testing.  Well, without this patch, my test
  machine dies on the following command *very* quickly:
  
  while true; do mdadm /dev/md0 -f /dev/sdc1 -r /dev/sdc1 -a /dev/sdc1;
  sleep 1; done
  
  In addition, without the patch you can watch the superblock's spare
  count go up with every single invocation of that command.
  
  With my patch, the same machine survived the above command running over
  the weekend, and in addition I mounted the raid1 array and ran a
  continuous loop of bonnie++ sessions to generate as much load as
  possible.  I've verified that the spare count stays consistent when
  failing a spare device, and I've verfied that once a device is synced up
  then the spare count is also decremented as the device is switched to
  being accounted as an active device.

  [PATCH] trivial patch for 2.4: always inline __constant_*
  
  Of these, at least the following were intended to be always inlined:
  
       12	__constant_c_and_count_memset
        6	__constant_memcpy
  
  Prolly #include <linux/compiler.h> is missing in some files,
  or included too late to have desired effect.
  Let's find them:
  
  find -name '*.o' | xargs grep -lF '__constant_c_and_count_memset'
  find -name '*.o' | xargs grep -lF '__constant_memcpy'
  } | sort | uniq
  
  Redoing this with allyesconfig revealed some more files.
  
  Most of them can be fixed with a single #include <compiler.h>
  in <string.h>. Along the way, I fixed some non-compilation buglets.
  I will submit those patches as replies now.

  [PATCH] Update Documentation/i2c/writing-clients
  
  Hi Marcelo,
  
  This is a quick update to the Documentation/i2c/writing-clients file. A
  similar change was accepted by Greg KH in 2.6 and was also applied to
  the i2c CVS repository.
  
  The changes are about i2c client driver IDs. It used to say that chip
  driver writers should ask for a unique ID. It now explains that such an
  ID is not required and they can go without it. The patch additionally
  features CodingStyle updates.
  
  Fell free to apply it if you want,
  thanks.
