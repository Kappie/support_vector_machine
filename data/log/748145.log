<pre>from the RunCoordinator eLog: 
 
CDF Update:   
 
    * Current Status: 
          o CDF has found a leak on an Aluminum manifold inside that they will not be able to repair tonight.  In addition, experts believe they have found another hole in the system with a borescope.   Experts will continue to check out the system this evening and then will start the process of closing up.  
          o The leak will not be fixed on this access.  CDF experts will go back to the drawing board and figure out what to do next. 
    * 11pm:   
          o CDF experts go home for the night. 
          o We had looked into getting a special search and secure to run studies overnight, but CDF is in a configuration with the BLMs down and no abort protection.   No studies for the night. 
    * Overnight: 
          o The Tevatron Machine Coordinator will leave turn on instructions. 
    * 6am: 
          o CDF resumes their access and will start to close the steel. 
    * ?10am: 
          o CDF access complete 
          o Search and Secure CDF.

We are running with BOTH SYSTEMS in !!!!!!!! 

<!-- Comment: Wed May 16 18;39;07 comment by...L2 -->
with both new system in, we had a few decision timeouts earlier, but when we started this new run, it has been running smooth for a while. trying to understand the problem seen earlier, we decided to increase the L1A rate to stress the system more... from 41KHz to
45Khz FredL1A... deadtime went up from 5.5% to ~8%. so far so good.

<!-- Comment: Wed May 16 18;45;05 comment by...L2 -->
now with FredL1A up to 56KHz, deadtime at 21%... not bad. this is the first time we are pushing the L1A rate way beyond 41KHz. we are learning something new.

<!-- Comment: Wed May 16 18;45;52 comment by...L2 -->
note that this is still without RECES... not yet. 

<!-- Comment: Wed May 16 19;08;27 comment by...L2 -->
now with FredL1A at ~64KHz, deadtime at 34%, final L1A at ~51KHz.
tried HRR by hand a few times. the first 2 manual HRR caused
decision timeout, but couldn't reproduce it since. will keep trying.

<pre>==== Summary: what we learned this afternoon === 
 
(1) With L2_Torture run, we first had trouble with decision timeouts... this even happens with the default system alone. excluding RECES was the solution.  
 
(2) after we ignore the RECES in the new system (hard coded in 
the CPU software, this needs to be automated via runcontrol soon), we were able to run much longer without decision timeouts... but still, from time to time, we encounter DTOs. 
we tried L2CAL alone, XFT alone, and L2CAL+XFT combinations. 
the only configuration didn't have DTOs was with L2CAL alone. but the run wasn't long enough to be conclusive. 
 
(3) later in the afternoon, the DTOs problem disappeared totally, 
even with L2CAL+XFT combo configuration... this happened without any new changes to the system. this is still puzzling. nevertheless, we were able to push the FREDL1A up to 64KHz to stress the new system, without problem. This is good. 
 
(4) we then decided to do manual HRRs, and see how the system recovers. From time to time, a manual HRR can cause decision timeouts, and another HRR solves the problem. This seems to be a feature related to the new system, because we did the same thing with the default system alone, and there is no problem like this. 
 
anyway, Eiko and Bob are here for COT testing, and we are hungry, 
so we will give the system to Eiko for now. and will test the system with RECES again later... to see if the RECES problem is still there. </pre>

Dirac replacement (Rack 2RR28c - slot 14). 
Today with Carla we tested a lot a strange effect we saw in l2cal pulsars side (1 LVDS line stucked to 1). 
We discovered that the problem was the Dirac (probably it didn't drive correctly the splitted cable), so we replaced it.

<pre>COT check out after the access: 
  
  We performed ASDQ calibration and compared the results with those  
on May 15th (before opening the plugs). We didnt see new dead  
channels or hot channels caused by the access. Superlayer 4 cells  
80-81 are a little warmer than yesterday (occupancy changed from  
1.05 to 1.10), but these two cells have become warm and quiet from time to time. We expect them to be colder after closing the plugs.

Finally we have put the full system together (with Reces, with new L2CAL and XFT) and we are running the system with L2TORTURE without problem. This is the best we could do (to stress the new system) without beam. We are ready to request the beam run tomorrow, hopefully at the beginning of store.

<h3> Today access </h3> 
We went in again for our n<sup>th</sup> access day  in a row to chase for the ISL PCE leak. This time the plug was pulled so we could access to the innermost parts of the detector. Doug Glenzinski and Ken Schultz worked in the bore assisted by Warren and Ulrich. It was quite rapidly determined that the leak was localized inside the silicon baggie. They introduced two catheters from the supply and return ends of the line (Portcard East): the leak was isolated to the Aluminum manifold and the cilran-Al connections (innermost possible part). The boroscope revealed several "brownish" features inside of the Al manifold. One of them was identified with a hole. 
 
<p>We have checkout SVX east: no new errors appeared. We are bringing SVX and ISL cooling set points to -6 and 10 C. 
 
<p>More details about what happened can be found as usual in the silicon <a href=http://www-cdfonline.fnal.gov/cgi/elog/det-system-elog.pl?nb=silicon&action=view&page=last&scroll=true>e-log</a>.
