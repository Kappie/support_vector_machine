HV monitoring for CLC etc is AFU as jdl would say... I'm guessing it's because the CPR caen is disabled.  I'm leaving the monitoring off for now.
<!-- Author: convery -->
<!-- Comment: Thu Nov 18 08;43;56 comment by...convery -->
by the way, who tried to start the old monitoring code?


<!-- Comment: Thu Nov 18 11;34;14 comment by...convery -->
Steve K says CPR HV is up now, but still having problems communicating with the CLC caen.  Will wait till the CLC work is done before messing with it.  Monitoring remains off.

CMX west wedge 15 is turned off - we need to inspect the wedge quickly.

Dale just called and asked for SW wedges 16-17 (miniskirt 30) to be turned off as well.  They are now off.

Steve Kuhlmann says installation of new CCR chamber complete. Apparently there has been/is a long-standing vertical mismatch of ~ 1/4" between NW & SW arches when they meet, which caused/contributed to the problem yesterday... SW arch being closed up... 
<br> 
Dean calls a few minutes later - power reset on arches. A transient current alarm on Generator # 2 occurred when this happened. Acknowledged, now OK.

Paged DAQ about ccal02;  Jane responded and saw that it looked as if the ADMEM in ccal02 wasn't responding at all, so advised paging Cal ADMEM.  Did that, and pager carrier took ccal02 to check it.  Found that the ADMEM memory had been completely wiped, reloaded it properly and returned it to us.  Now appears to be working normally.

15 microAmps.  Will replace the base and see if this fixes the

<h3>TrigMon Crashing Status</h3><br> 
I was paged because TrigMon kept crashing while it was trying to initialize the XFT simulation.<br> 
It would print  "Initializing the XFT System...." on line 560 of XFTSim.cc, but not " Done" on line 713.<p> 
We paged Kevin Lannon and Ben Kilminster, who suggested the problem was probably with the <b>online database</b>.  To test this, I temporarily modified runTrigMon.tcl file to <b>NOT</b> use the online database.  TrigMon is now running fine.<p> 
I believe that the XFT folks need to get together with Bill Badgett  to get this fixed.

<pre>I changed the phototube base on CEM 6L13E and this reduced the dark 
current on the tube to 1.4nA.  So it appears the high current of 
10-30 microAmps was due to a bad base.  The dark current with a new 
base should come down into the picoamp range during the next day.</pre>

HV monitoring for CLC, etc is running again.  I powercycled the CLC caen to clear up the communication errors... not sure this is a good thing.  After adding some database tags, I seem to be talking to the CPR display in the Global Alarms Summary.  However, the tags picked up by the HV Summary page are either not right, or are being confused by the same tags being written to by the muon3 pc.  After trying to control the CPR HV from the control room, the communication with the CLC caen got all screwed up again and I again powercycled the caen... I'm hoping this is a coincidence!  Can't promise the monitoring will run without problems tonight since I don't understand what is going on.

<b>CMX work summary:</b> 
<p> 
The SW miniskirt was moved back into its optimize position (about 5 mm out from "design" to avoid contact with the cooling lines). 
</p> 
<p> 
Spent a good part of the last two days looking at signals via the TDC readout crate for CMX.  We've fixed two obvious problems related to the signal cables not being plug in.  We also have a working solution for the new channels we are attempting to add in the cross-over region for west wedges 6 and 7.  The bottom line is that we have gained 3 new channels while 4 have to be by-passed since they are noisy (more details can be found in the CMX e-log).  We may look at this again once the CMX SW arch is pulled in but likely this will be the configuration we use when data taking starts again. 
</p> 
We request a long cosmic run (with muon crates, etc.) to help in our checkout.
