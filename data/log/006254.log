<pre>BSC-2: East and West stations. 
 
Added bleeder resistor to signal output at PMT base. 
Bleeder resistor is 100k, and connected to the signal  
output through a T. 
 
BSC-3 and BSC-4 stations MUST NOT have a bleeder  
resistor at the signal output (input to ADMEM  
is through a `standard' CEM transition board).</pre>

Tested again a new send program for beam loss measurement, which is running in the 6U VME crate CLC_01.  
<br> 
Konstantin and I tested the new version of the program before and it succeeded then. But, when Dmitri tried to include our changes into his code, he failed running it on the crate.  
So, I modified the latest Dmitri's code that is running in the crate now. Then, the modified code worked well.

Got a call from CR that the BSC HV had an alarm on 6/9/01 (Sat) 4:30pm. Found that three HV channels were OFF (ch 06, 16 and 20 
in slot 7 of crate 1). I turned them ON manually.

Called from CH that B0PLOS and B0ALOS were not updated in ACNET  
on 6/10/01 (Sun) from 4am.  
I checked the b0clc01 crate and found that the program was  
not running. I tried to login the crate but I couldn't because 
the crate was hanged up. I reset the crate, then the beam losses 
were back.

<pre>Called from CR that there were several BSC alarms on 6/10/01 
(Sun) around 1pm. It seems BSC alarms appeared on the HV display 
and then they were gone quickly. And it happened several times  
during a short period of time. I checked the HV PC, but didn't 
find any problems (log file didn't have anything). Maybe I need 
to ask Andrea to look into it...</pre>

<pre>At 11am, found some HV channels for the BSC were off due to 
trips. I didn't get any call from control room(?). 
 
Lowered the corresponding HV channels by 200V for BSC2, 3 and 4. 
For the BSC1-E3 (Ch 6), it was lowered by 50V to be still above 
the plateau.

<pre>Rick and I tried to perform QIE calibration for the BSC ADMEMs 
located in slots 16 and 17 in CLC_00 crate. We found no pedestals 
for QIE channels 1, 2 and 3 in slot 16, and also the RMS for 
QIE channel 1 is strange. The result is as follows; 
 
 ADMEM  QIE  CAP #EVENTS AVE_RANGE  MEAN   RMS

   16    3    3    1000   0.0        0.0   0.0 
 
We replaced three CAFE cards corresponding to channels 1, 2 and  
3, and looked at the pedestals again. The result was same as 
before. So, we concluded that the transition board is the source 
of this problem. I think we need to replace the board soon,  
otherwise the data from the BSC1-E counters cannot be used.</pre>

<pre>Update: 
Looked at the data for several runs to find out when the above  
behavior started to occur. The result is as follows;

It seems this behavior started at somewhere between 9 and 10am 
on 6/13.  
 
I got a call from control room around 9am on 6/13 about no  
updates on beam losses in ACNET. I found the HV PC was hanged up, 
so reset the PC and restarted the program at 9:30am. Then, I 
checked the signal for the BSC1-East counters using scope because 
the SciCo requested to do so. When I did this, I did most likely  
something bad.

<pre>Replaced the transition board (type #1) with the spare.  
 
Looked at the pedestal distributions for the BSC ADMEMs. They 
look OK. Their RMS values are around 15-20 for the BSC-1, 20-30 
for the BSC-2, 30-35 for the BSC-3 and 40 for the BSC-4. 
 
The discriminator threshold on the transition board was set to 
15 mV (974 on the probe).</pre>

<pre>Changed the HV settings for the BSC to study gain matching.

Many of HV values for BSC-2, 3 and 4 were lowered by about 200 V 
to avoid trips which could happen at the early stage of beam 
store. Since 6/16, we didn't see any trips so lowering -200 V 
from previous settings would be sufficient to avoid trips. But, 
the ADC count responses from ADMEM were also very low. 
 
Let's look at what happen with +100V higher voltages for these 
counters...</pre>
