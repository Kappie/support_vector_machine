<pre>I have removed older L3 exe tags to avoid confusion in the  
control room.  Aces should be testing out the new 3.17.0 
exes.  Default L3tag should be 131 - which has all the  
reconstruction code and filters needed for commissioning  
trigger tables.  If crashes are occurring with the 3.17.0  
version than you can fall back to tagset 125 which is indentical  
to 131 but made in 3.16.0.  There is a new Null exe which  
tests the new calibration loading at Level-3, tagset 133.</pre>

<pre>Checked the noise on BMU. Even with HV off, the 
noise is still present. Also, found 15 us noise 
which is characteristics of CAEN power supply noise. 
 
BMU channel 30 on CAEN supply 1 trips while ramping 
up (at around 4.7kV). The HV setting for the channel 
and its partner (channel 26) have been set to 100 V 
so that it won't trip till the next access.</pre>

<pre>Looks like old ATM problem. We thought we  
solved it a while ago by changing ATM fabrique. 
When we add Silicon, we increase the number  
of fragments. It makes ATM connection unstable.  
Report will be send to Steve Tether.    
 
I cleaned up EVB and L3. Start run again with 4 subfarms. 
It works but reformatter rejects 100% of events.  
Looks like reformatter does not understand SVX format.  
 
Trying to run with all subfarms.  
No input errors on converters.  
We processing events VERY slowly  
32 events for 10 minutes with a help of HRR.  
Scanner Manager does not receive triggers.  
 
Clean up EVB again. </pre>

There were no complaints about bad ATM packets in the /var/log/messages file of any converter node, so this is not a repeat of the earlier ATM hardware problem. It looks like the SCPUs were screwed up and told the Scanner Manager that they sent their fragments but really did not.

<pre>Analysis of reformatter error shows that the CCAL crates are 
the culprits (SteveN please relax it is not the silicon). 
 
Might bee that downloading new code into CCAL04 causes the 
problem since the error appeared in CCAL05. Reboot the crate.

PTM (Plug Temperature Control System) Looks like 
a second circuit breaker tripped yesterday (probably).   
The temperatures are not controlled on PE02, PE03,  
PE05, and PE06 now.  I disabled the alarms for  
those boxes until the circuit breakers can be 
reset on access (and apparently the toroids must be 
moved to allow us to open the breaker box).  Cause  
of the trips is not known yet.  System was running  
for 9 months with no trips, now 2 in a week.

We have tested the new Level3 scheme of picking up calibrations 
from Valid-Sets (at run-start time as usual), this scheme works. 
 
The Null executable built from 3.17.0 is  
l3 tagset=133 
 
The DEFAULT Exe (which runs reconstruction-> COT tracking 
Muons CdfEmObject etc) and writes a single stream is 
l3 tagset=134. (This does the same thing as tagset 131  
except 131 uses the old calibration scheme)

About 1600, I changed the clock from 36x36 mode to 1x8 mode.  I'd forgotten to do this before, mea culpa.  It confused the L2 people no end.

We will keep the clock in this mode until the first 36x36 store.

<pre>Finished updating PSM monitoring program. Digital words from Pei PSM are readout together with their complement word for data consistency cross-checking, which should improve the readout reliability. Also the way of treating readout errors with "analog" voltages is changed, which should slightly speed up the program. Due to this activity few heart beat alarms were generated. </pre>

We successfully ran w/ 6 wedges of silicon integrated for 
a couple hours.  TeV in shot set-up right now and plan to 
spend the first 4 hours of the store performing various studies. 
So, we're taking ourselves out of the run and turning the silicon 
off for now.  Once TeV is done playing, Rob Napora can bring the 
designated wedges (he knows which they are) to STDBY, then into 
the run.  If all is well, we'll bring them to full volts.

Voltages are still at standby for sensitive detectors.  CLC shows
collisions are basically centered in z, so have asked MCR to try to improve loss rate so that we can run.  They also see poor Pbar lifetime and so we agree they should try to clean this up.  Note separators are ON during this store so far (different from previous ones where they were off).

did some L2 studies and we also ran silicon in integration during 
other runs.   
 
CLC calibration should NOT be done until cleared by expert. 
Did some calibrations (see above); others remain to be done. 
Encountered problems with SMX crates and reset them on instructions  
from expert.  See board for calibrations that need to be done. 
 
Store went in near end of shift.  We have it through the night
