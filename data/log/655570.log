<pre>Awaiting shot setup. 
 
We hope that Tevatron will resolve issue with wet engine which caused  
them to drop store quickly. 
There is a large stack of pbars, so maybe they will turn around quick on this. 
 
Mourning Ohio State loss last night ...

For some reason, after doing this and nothing else!!, our cosmic L2 accept rate is now 30Hz instead of 2Hz. DOes anybody know what's going on? The 2jet 1.5GeV trigger is being fired now, and was not fired before. That's the reason for the difference between 30Hz and 2Hz.


<!-- Comment: Tue Jan  8 10;21;51 comment by...Ben -->
<pre>We paged L2 to understand why the jet trigger rate coming out of 
L2 changed from 1.7 Hz to 30 Hz.

For the last 4 days, the cosmics trigger has been running at 1.7 Hz, which corresponds to the zero bias trigger prescaled by a million.   Although there were jet triggers at L1, they weren't making it past L2.
All of a sudden, this fixed, and now we are getting 30 Hz from the cosmics trigger.  

What changed ?

<pre>Looks like L2 rate = L1 rate. It seems it auto-accepts everything. Will look more</pre>
<!-- Comment: Tue Jan  8 11;50;42 comment by...Laura -->
In the last few days we run with a recompiled trigger table to debug some executable items. This morning I've replaced the original one. So, unless you don't see additional problems, now it should be fine.

<pre>Updated current limits for COT high voltage.  Was inadvertantly left too high (after supply calibration), so probably the limit was set higher than the maximum the supplies can accept, which caused the trips earlier.</pre>

the plan:  wet engine repair (although it might be an external electrical connection, not the engine), also a set of transfers to recycler which would give it about 360e30, d0 access of 1 hour. When all that finishes up (noonish), shot setup.
