We need to restart L3Manager. We check this process in not running 
both on b0dap31 and b0dap34 ( 
<a href= 
'/cgi/elog/elog.pl?nb=2003&action=view&page=734&frame=2&anchor=13:56:49.905'> 
see here. </a> ).  
Finally we need to abort the run and go through a local "partition" of L3Manager to bring it to match the run control state.

This happened again for run 168678.  ProcMon alerted us that L3Manager Parent was not running, so we restarted it on b0dap31, aborted the run, issued a partition transition for L3 manager, then Config & Activate.

<b>Rev F TDCs</b> <br><br> 
 
We have been running additional tests on the 2 Rev E and 8 Rev F TDCs in the diagnostic crate b0diag01.  We included them in 3 L2 torture runs and reading them out in spy mode with the hardware event builder.  In run 168676, we used a tracer with a new PROM (fix the DTACK glitch) and it ran successfully.  For run 168677, 
we used a tracer with an old prom...we saw the well-known "byte-shift" problem immediately, as we had hoped.  For run 168878, we reverted back to the new tracer prom, and it continues to run successfully at > 350 Hz L2A rate. 
 
<br> <br> 
We conclude that these TDCs are ready to be installed in a COT 
crate at the earliest convenient opportunity.

<pre>Made one very small change in the RunControl GUIs,  
per the advice of Sun Microsystems:  remove the  
remoteNotify() call in the over-ridden dispose()  
method of those classes which inherit JFrame (and  
similar)   This is supposed to cure an obscure  
but catastrophic crash mode of the Java Virtual Machine. 
 
Have asked Ace to restart RunControl to test out. 
 
The removal of this call should cause no obvious  
change, as your not supposed to have to call it.  It was  
placed there originally to work around a memory  
leak in an earlier version of JDK.  But that's probably  
more than you wanted to know.

Turn on the Silicon for quiet time L2 pulsar test.
<!-- Author: Jason / Luca -->
<!-- Comment: Tue Sep  2 20;09;15 comment by...Jason / Luca -->
There is some question as to whether or not there is beam in the machine currently.  MCR says we have 45 min more of quiet time (originally, we had one hour), but PLOS is about 570 Hz.  ACNet page E2 says "Fifos Recording", but the integrated dosage on each BLM is 0 Rads.  We also saw a very high rate when we ran COSMICS_SILICON_TAPE, Level 3 became mostly green and we had to end the run (168685).

After the quiet time COSMICs, it would be useful to include crate VRB_ISL_06 in whatever tests are going on, in particular, a long 
L2 Torture run would be nice, to look for l1 DONE timeouts.

<pre>L3 expert has completed the Pulsar+silicon cosmic test runs 
to study the reformatter errors.  I have again disabled DAQ 
readout for the Pulsar crate (b0l2pu00). In preparation for the 
next Pulsar beam run, I have changed the readoutList for XFLD  
and XTRD banks to 0.  The default value is 7 for both banks.   
I will restore the ROL values after the Pulsar beam run.

<!-- Comment: Tue Sep  2 21;24;20 comment by...Guillelmo -->
It happens the same feature as previous runs. There is a reformatter error rate of about ~5% due to error code 1.<br>
When I tried to check again that event offline, I don't get any error, and it fisnishes successfully.<br>
We have more debug info, so we hope we will have more news soon.

<font color=red>Shift Summary: </font><pre>Started and ended shift with Tevatron studies. 
L2 torture tests (13,282,3709) 
run after ReV D tdc board replacement 
(done on previous shift). 
 
  During quiet time, 
did cosmic runs with all HV (including SVX) on, 
with pulsar diagnostic readout, to 
study reformatter errors (Cheng-ju+Guillelmo). 
with new L3 debug code.  Errors occur as 
seen before (5%), but go away when looking 
at same events offline. 
 
One clock error (Sync tim., RF miss.,seq-hold) 
occurred after cosmic run, coincident with MCR 
cycling Ering. 
 
After quiet time, went back to L2 torture tests 
(vrb-ils-06 in). 
 
We did a test for JDL for L2 tagset 343 
(this has a new high_pt_bjet trigger), 
Run 168690.  Ran smoothly. Returned to 
L2 torture. 
 
Note: during quiet time we were confused 
by the fact that lostp was reading 600 Hz, 
usually this would be zero.  Rob R. 
checks, there is now an	offset in 
the readback.  
 
Waiting for next shot.
