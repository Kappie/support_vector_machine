<pre>Work for CEM LED/XEF hardware. 
Transition card in ccal01 (wedge 3,4,5 west) was replaced. 
The cables and cards for 13E and 16W were checked. 
 
We would like to request CEM LED and Xef calibration run 
as soon as possible to see if problem were solved.

COSWB-3 PEI power supply +5VA has continuously been tripping. 
I set sense switch to internal only to get it out of the faulty state and tracer board may be checked. I adjusted all of the the outputs although the +5VA could not be adjusted to 5.0V. The +5VA was adjusted to 4.78 as maximum.  This power supply will be replaced within the next 36 hrs.

Clock Guy here. Earlier this afternoon, Steve Hahn phoned me with concerns of faulty Clock operation. First, Steve, you mentioned that the PCC was in Freq_Lock mode. Strange, this is a mode the Clock's PCC no longer uses. Upon examination, the scope was not being triggered due to the fact that the Sequencer's Trig Bucket counter setting was not set. When initializing the Sequencer, this parameter must be set to "6" using the Clock GUI. Second, the Clock's PCC was put in Free_Run mode. This is the CORRECT mode when you want to run the Clock external to the Tevatron. The only modes of operation, at present, for the Clock"s PCC module is Normal or FRee_Run. Freq_Lock mode is now a purely diagnostic tool and is no longer used due to the improvement of the PCC's PLL circuit.

L3 Display and (integration) hardware database have also been updated.


<!-- Date: Tue Jan 14 18:36:48 2003 -->
CSL code modified, temporarily, to turn off checking 
of database instance (i.e. production vs. integration). 
This should allow data taken this week to go to the 
look area or tape just as it normally would, even though 
the integration instance of the online db is being used 
(normally a dangerous thing to do because previously 
used run numbers might be used again.)

b0pcal10, 11 are probably tracer connection mis-matches; 
b0cot07 probably doesn't have power;  it's too late to

SVX chiller tripped. Eva came and took a look. Still looking into it. May have a bad silicon cooling module.

Many strange occurances this evening, summarized in the <a href=
'/cgi/elog/det-system-elog.pl?nb=cryo-gas&action=view&page=747&frame=2&anchor=20:59:26'> cryo elog. </a> 
 
<br>
<br>
In the end we found that a manual valve in the collision hall was closed! (don't know who to blame) In the process of investigating, Roser and Stanek replaced the solenoid for the valve PV_CHSUP.  The cooling for SVX is back online and all alarms should be taken seriously.

<!-- Date: Tue Jan 14 19:54:59 2003 -->
A worrying burning smell wafted into the control room...but we are fairly sure it is the heating system. The smell seems to be localised underneath the heating vents. Also Rob Roser has been turning the heating up throughout the evening. Gave us a "funny five minutes" though :)

I checked both plug and central calorimeter crates in SMXR
diagnostic readout mode. pcal10 is definitely sick - the read
buffer value is not constant on all of the data channels.
I see this on both boards and so I suspect that either the 
TRACER or the processor work might be responsible (I haven't
seen this particular class of failure before).

Finally, there was a L3 Manager error
