We checked the CLC & Forward Detectors PC. The stand alone monitor works fine and IFIX is running there. From VNODE1 instead they are still gray. I think for the same reason of the Plug. 
CLC, BSC, RPS and MNP are OFF now.

Steve Hahn calls - nominally to help with DAQ. Also will try to get master clock reset & working
<!-- Author: Errede -->


<!-- Date: Sun May 26 17:06:16 2002 -->
Trying to get the DAQ going, I noticed many sync errors and 
CDF_ERROR pulled by many crates. Walking to the clock crate: 
there is no clock or BC... this is why Steve Hahn was called. <P> 
On another subject, I recovered the 2 TDC's in the htdc crate 
that have been reported as failing.

Let's summarize the things done so far: 
 
slot 11 in b0musc00 is taken out 
b0l1gl00 -> Calar's working on 
b0l2de01 -> because l1gl00's taken out 
b0svt03 is taken out -> expert(?)'s working on 
 
Mario's trying something to make sure all crates working properly.

Everything (thanks to Arnd and Mario, saved our lives) is running now exept b0svt03 and b0musc00, Mike Kirby is looking at the muon Scintilator, we are paging again the svt expert. b0l2de01 crate has been pulled out and in again, the spare one was pulled out but not placed back in (they just forgot to o it), this seems to have fixed previous problems.

<!-- Date: Sun May 26 19:29:45 2002 -->
The Level 1 global crate is working again. Here is what happened. <P> 
The VME bus would not work at all, ie. any reads/writes to any 
board in the crate (TRACER/PreFred/Fred) would return errors. 
Neither resetting nor powercycling helped, both before and after 
the clock was working. Under Carla's instructions, I extracted 
first a couple of prefred's (up to slot 4) - still no VME. Then 
the remaining PreFred's the FRED in slot 8, and the spare FRED in 
slot ? (17?) - VME came back. After reinstalling first some PreFred's, 
then FRED in slot 8 and the remaining preFRED boards, the crate 
still looked OK. Taking a cosmic run confirmed this. I forgot 
to reinstall the Fred in slot 17, so we don't know if the 
problem disappeared mysteriously or because of the missing 
board. <P> 
For the rest of CDF, only SVT03 and the TDC in slot 11 of b0musc00 are not yet working again.

Run # 145348
<!-- Date: Sun May 26 19:50:42 2002 -->
<pre>Looking at the problem in b0musc00, slot 11 (SN 251), I saw that this card was not responding during a mapping of the crate in VISIONdemo.  so after a bus reset, logged back into the crate, and the card was now visible to a cratemap.  when trying to do basic reads and writes to the control register though, it seem that the VME interface was glitchy.  I could write zeros to the control register, but when trying to write non-zero values, the register wouldn't change but stay as all zeros.  It didn't give a bus error, just wouldn't change.  This wasn't the case when trying to get TDCTest going, here the VME bus errors were rather copious.  anyway, I went down and reseated the card, and this seems to have fixed the problem.  I can read and write to the control register, and have run the full crate through TDCTest 4 times.  the card does have channel failures, but these failures are known failures and have been in the system for atleast a month.  I'll inform the Muon TDC expert about these channel failures when he returns from kart racing.  I'll return the crate to the aces, and let them reintegrate.</pre>

<table border=0><td><tr><td bgcolor=#e0e030>Note to Owl shift personnel: 
CDF clock is currently in "free run" mode. If want to take beam data (with TevKE .ge. 150 GeV), you will need to put CDF clock in "normal" mode.  To do this, with Run_Control idled, go to B0dap53 console (the right-most terminal at ACE desk). Type in "whoami" - you should get response "cdfdaq".  
 
If so, then type in "setup clock<cr>" (<cr> = carriage return), 
 
then type in "cd $CLOCK_DIR"  
 
then type in "clockGUI b0clk00".  
 
Wait a bit, and the Salvador Dali memorial master clock program will pop up. Bring it down from the top monitor, click on the clockGui HELP button.  
 
In the "Set Sync Delay" port, type in "6<cr>" 
Then click on "Set Sync Delay", then click on "Normal" for 
Normal running of clock. 
 
Then click on the "SFMs" tab, open this up and click on the 
"Good Luck" button. You're done.

Ollie Keimschies from MCR calls - he's noticed that SVX abort clock has crazy #'s in it. We need to recover/reset this, too. 
Paged SVX expert. He calls - we find T:B0LMAA rate meter (to left of IFIX monitor) is pegged - CAMAC module driving it is somehow 
pegging it - its not the rate meter that is bad. But we can't find the problem, working over the phone. CAMAC module may have been frapped in the power glitch. So SVX expert is coming in to take a look at it.

Problem fixed simply by unplugging the clock input to the CAMAC

<font color=red>Shift Summary: </font><pre>We inherit job of recovering from power glitch earlier this morning. Many problems - we focus on getting DAQ operational so that we can ascertain whether or not we need to make access. Little by little we succeed in getting CDF back together again - with much help from many experts called in. See above for full details. We are able to carry out all calibrations successfully, and do some cosmic ray data taking. A miracle, it seems... 
The power glitch this morning - at 05:39 - occurred when dirty insulator arced over. It was foggy & cold. ComEd claims that the insulator looks good now... But this could happen again e.g. tomorrow morning ~ same time, if weather conditions are similar... </pre>
