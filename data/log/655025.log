Starting run 135848 with Physics_0_03[3,240] with alpha in cutting.  See end of previous shift for rates and deadtime snapshots from run 135846, this physics table with alpha in tagging.  I am not seeing any DTO that the ace encountered trying to run this table last night.  Let's hope it was a fluke.  The HV are down for COT and muon systems.

From run 135848 with alpha in cutting and new physics table.  L3 rate input 131Hz, output 128Hz.  


<!-- Date: Fri Dec 28 08:24:37 2001 -->
Niether of the past two runs with the new Physics_0_03 tables were cutting at L3.  Changing to Physics_0_03[1].  This table definately did cut at L3.  Run 135849 shows reduction of rates at L3, but due to PS, not to cutting (reformatters).  YKK and Boris are here and we are exploring.  We are running with Cosmics and HV low on COT and Muons, but we should still see some of the jet paths that don't require CLC.  The L3 display on rates and deadtimes doesn't show any input values - everything is 0.

<!-- Date: Fri Dec 28 08:31:14 2001 -->
We decide to just end the run, repartition, and cs.  Before I was just CSing and changing trigger table.  There is some confusion over a bug in Rates and Deadtimes DAQMON about reporting L3 rates if you don't repartition.  However, the values quoted above for Input and Output and Reformatter cutting from L3 came from the L3 display that Boris et al are responsible for - and it should be 100% reliable.

After repartitioning and cs we see L1A 40Hz, L2A 5Hz.  L3 is mostly pale blue.  This seems more reasonable for running a physics table with no beam.  Not sure what happened before.  Is it possible not repartitioning the system when changing trigger tables got things confused? I've done this in the past and not had any problems.  Ending run to give silicon away.

<P> 
Part of Layer-00 has been added to the nominal silicon set. 
It is a section on the east side. 
After we learn from running this, we'll add more. 
<P> 
Layer-00 is only about a cm from the beam, so it can be sensitive to high losses. 
<B>It is important for the shift crews to be careful about NOT leaving the silicon high voltage on during messy beam conditions.</B> 
The HV (i.e., bias) should be turned down at the end of each shot as per silicon expert instructions. 
<P> 
Initially, Layer-00's nominal bias is set low to minimize problems from losses. Once the next shot is in and we are running stably, please page me at 722-7565. I'd like to come to manually set the bias voltage for a test run. 
<P>

<h3>Howdy</h3> 
So, I wanted to check out some code changes with 
full integrated CDF-they work fine, but when we 
added L00 in we added a new Vrb crate/SCPU (b0eb23) and 
we quickly got Busy timeouts and the death of the SCPU proxy etc. 
(Run 135860).  Cleaned up EVB, with same result (135861). 
Dropped L00 out and all was well (135862).  Examined  
ATM switch and saw Red and Orange LEDs lit up on spigot 
corresponding to cable "EVB 00" which not surprisingly corresponds to b0eb23.  Stopped run so that Boris could 
reset the switch<P> 
In the meantime, we also noted that this <a href= 
'/cgi/elog/elog.pl?nb=2001&action=view&page=937&frame=2&anchor=15:52:59'>entry</a> made on Xmas Day 
where one CIPRICO RAID ARRAY Power supply has failed, is still true. Bill Badgett says "Page CSL" 
  
<!-- Author: SCN -->
<!-- Comment: Fri Dec 28 12;32;31 comment by...K Burkett -->
Note that we tried to call the online computer pager first, but
they didn't respond so we had to call the DAQ pager.  Fortunately, Bill responded to that.


<!-- Comment: Fri Dec 28 12;34;56 comment by...SCN -->
Boris wants to power cycle the switch, then reboot
at least the converter nodes, if not the whole damn L3 farm.
Said it would take about 15 minutes.  If that doesn't work, 
we'll remove the L00 wedge for this shot I guess.

Tony called us back and will be in later this afternoon to check

"Shot setup in 5-10 minutes"
<!-- Author: Larry -->

<pre>I was paged for the CEM HV problem on IFix. The CEM bars were displayed yellow. I found that all SW arch PMTs had HV values lower by 3-8 Volts than the nominal. This was caused by a "drift"  
in the gamma power supply output. I adjusted the gamma by 2 Volts 
and all the channels went back to within 2 Volts from nominal.</pre>

Control room paged today about a CSL RAID array power 
supply failure. It was power supply A of the top Ciprico 
370 GB array, also called disk1. This array is currently 
not used for data taking. I have powered down disks 1 and 
2 which are not being used now. Will investigate 
'power supply failure' message.

<font color=red>Shift Summary: </font><pre>08:30 MCR calls. Shot setup est - at 11:30 
 
10:30 Ayana still snowed in in Buffalo 
 
12:00 Steve N., Boris working on L00 readout; in the process a bad raid disk 
power supply - some CSL thing, apparently bad since Chrismas 
 
12:30 Fotis adjusted SW CEM gamma up 2V 
 
12:37 Shot setup! On with the solenoid! Stack 127 
 
15:00 Store 867 initial luminosity 9.27, HV problems with TOF, Mary coming  
from O'Hare to turn on Si (it's ok, "it is not the real deal yet") 
 
15:30 Lots of busy deadtime, l3 all green, rates, event size big ?? 
      L2 timeout bing   
 
15:50 Stop run for Mary to bias (unbiased = big?)</pre>
