the EH display is cleared and the messages are reset every time a run starts, but to get a new version, you actually have to close/restart the GUI itself. We did this.

<p>John Crawford from AD called.  Tomorrow at 0830, they would 
like to replace a 480 circuit breaker in the B0 service building.  Apparently, this powers the 208 breaker panel which 
in turn powers our accelerator crates in the control room. 
They will give a call to the control room before they 
actually turn the power off.</p>

Problem repeats. 
<!-- Date: Fri Sep 28 11:57:18.984 2007 -->
<p>Talked with Jim Volk and Del Allspach about plans for 
the east low beta quads.  There is one quad which cannot be 
moved transversely to the beamline in the plane of the Tevatron 
due to a square nut which is touching the adjacent steel 
block.  Dervin will attempt to cut the corner of the nut so 
as to allow this movement; it's anticipated that this  
movement may be 
necessary when the quads on the Tevatron side are adjusted and 
they come back and check the quads in the collision hall.</p>

<pre>summary of Level-2 tests: 
 
1) tested the new tags that include tracklist and have been purged of clist data integrety checks. 
-L2torture worked ( have not checked the others will do that hopefully later today ) 
-there were a few problems but I think they have been resolved now ( it works ok for the last hour ) 
 
2) Have returned the system to the previous version of l2 code ( no tracklist ) for the weekend. 
 
-noticed that we are running L2TORTURE[19,952,633] but white board says [19,952,639]. We should probably make this consistent ? 
 
l2exe is set to respawn again.</pre>

<p>Marcel wanted clarification, so I will be pellucid.  The 
O2 PPM alarm we got from the COT process system alarms earlier 
were due to flushing out the COT gas purification system in  
the east side of the assembly pit.  Apparently, this generated 
a hiccup of O2 which set off the PPM alarm.  Del said he does 
not expect this to happen again.</p>
