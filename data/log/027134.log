<!-- Notes: -->
<pre>We start the shift trying to find the cosmic data taken 
with the standard physics table. 
 
Then we have requests for TOF QIE and TAC calibrations; 
Rick's check of all CAL; 
Double check that all COT crates are really working. 
 
</pre>


<!-- Date: Wed Jun 12 08:54:37 2002 -->
<pre>We have found files associated with the cosmic running with 
physics table.  The files are not in the look area for all 
runs except for run 146279. 
 
For now we give the CAL crates to Rick for one hour.</pre>

<pre>146279 files (about 1/2 hour of running are in look area). 
 
Other files that can be found are visible by the ace 
on b0dau32 in /cdf/b0/disk#/ace/00 for runs: 
 
146271 (23b5f) 
146274 (23b62)

<pre>Had to stop this run also for clock errors! 
 
Found on PCC: sync missing, sync timing, & RF missing

Clock in normal mode. 
 
Almost recovered from RC, even able to clear latched 
partition error remaining non L1Cal01 and 02.

<h4> COT Update</h4> 
 
Returning COT crates to Ace.  Fixes on East endplate by Bob 
Wagner check out OK.  There was a repeater plug-in problem 
for SL4-154 (R415), and fixed (a usual high tension point for  
the flat-cable).  Only new problem is a high-width cell pair 
SL8-236, which may have an on-board ASDQ problem with QDR  
control voltage, but ISL crew ready for baggy, so will proceed.

<pre>From CSL expert: 
Was paged around 2:20 pm.  Certain calibrations were getting hung up and the calibration CSL was considered to be the culprit.  There was some difficulty getting the calibration CSL to restart.   
 
As far as the calibration getting hung up:  from the calibration csl end, the CSL was receiving connections, but not receiving any events. 
 
The restart problem is probably due to too many smartsocekts clients being used, since Mario reported that there were smartsockets errors when trying to stop the calibration csl. 
 
Perhaps this lack of smart clients also contributed to the daq system not being able to get events sent to the csl?

<font color=red>Shift Summary: </font><pre>We did lots of good things.  Please see the shift log for details. 

We did have a few instances of clock glitches with no 
apparent correlation with any of our activities.

It is likely that additional plug laser and TOF calibration
runs will be needed/requested.

Having frequent troubles getting calibration runs to end
gracefully; CSL experts and others have been helping us
on these issues.
