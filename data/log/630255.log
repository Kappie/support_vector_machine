<pre>1.  We installed a new protection circuit on West Phi=15. 
Board  411 -1.   The 15V power leads to the termination 
backplane came loose and Fred Lewis is suppose to fix 
this afternoon.   
 
2.  We removed dead Preamps cards from the following wedges. 
These will go to argonne to be fixed:

Karen and Gary set the scope up on strip channels in SMX1 
for West Phi=18.   I turned on the HV for this chamber so 
now from HVmon, HV appears to be on all of West CES, but 
all channels except for West phi=15 and West phi=18 are 
disconnected at the COW.</pre>

All SMX Plug termination boards are now installed and  
all the plug showermax crates are calibrated.    
 
We even found a loose cable in pcal02, slot 6, smx4 and  
fixed it.     
 
The central termination boards are in the process of being  
installed.  
 
West phi=11 to 23 have termination boards  
East phi=10 to 23 have termination boards:  
 
West 18-23 (ccal06,07) have been calibrated and look ok  
East 18-23 (ccal14,15) have been calibrated and look ok.</pre>

Installed 4 crates of modified preamps in 18W,20W,20E,21E. 
 
Removed all SMD boards plus SMC board from W phi=1 because of 
blown +5 fuses.  Replaced 5V rabbit supply (A).

old SMXR 564483-22  (is ok) 
New SMXR 564570-109 
 
Didn't fix problem - Find +7.5V sagging, swap B rabbit supply. 
 
Reinstalled +5V supply (with empty crate) to Wphi=1 and measure 
+5V bad supply putting out +6.7V. 
Put good supply back in and install new SMD and SMC cards.

Take scope up to Wphi=4,5.   These two wedges fail calibrations 
because of noise.   Also, muon guys claim they see large 
noise pulses on their signal lines.   We observer a 400mV 
800Hz triangluar wave  on signal lines correlated with the 
7.5V supply. 
 
We try many many things.  Eventually trace it to a bad pin on the 
400 Hz power line.  One of the things that was performed was 
the moving of 400Hz power outlets from the top wedges  
(where we couldn't reach them) to the adjacent wedges. 
 
Also swap out 4 SMD boards in the plug to try to fix  
single channel problems.  None of our swaps fixed any 
single channel, but we didn't swap back SMD boards.

Calibrate the central system. everything is online and  
calibrated except 
west (4,5) ccal01 and ccal03 (youngdo was sourcing) and 
haven't been able to calibrate ccal03. 
 
Mon Nov 5, 2001

Install the last crate of pramps (west phi=5). 
 
calibrate all of central (except ccal10) youngdo is sourcing.

<pre>Tuesday Nov 27- 
-------------- 
 
anomolous radiation in the CDF hall kills lots of 
power supplies and causes many other spurious problems: 
 
 
SMX Access -  
 
  We tried to recover SMXRs/SMD errors   
in the east PCal crates, 1 west Pcal crate and 1 central  
CCal crate.   
These SMXRs have been giving bunch count errors and   
"not responding errors"  and failing calibrations since   
Sunday  (Sat night, everything look good).  
 
  Problem SMXRs:  
East Plug   
Pcal07 - slot4 - Box 11  
Pcal10 - slot6 - Box 3  
Pcal11 - slot4 - Box 12  
Pcal11 - slot5 - Box 1  
West Plug  
Pcal02 - slot6 - Box 8  
Central  
Ccal07 - slot4 - (West phi=22)  
 
A combination of replacing boards and moslty recycling power  
at the SMXR crate seemed to fix the problem.  
 
It appears the SMXR -SMD communication froze for one or  
more of the SMD crate cables and data was no longer being  
sent from the SMD to the SMXR.   These errors could be observed  
in the header bit.    
 
There still remain several other Ccal SMXR problems:  
 
Ccal01 - slot4 (West phi=4)  
Ccal02 - slot4 (west phi=7)  
Ccal02 - slot5 (west phi=8)  
 
The west phi=7 problem looks to be a sagging 7.5 supply. 
 
Thur: Nov 29,2001: 
------------------ 
 
continue recovering from Sunday episode. 
In addition, try to clean up SMDs reporting errors 
from larrys YMON summary files and replace some 
broken termination boards. 
 
- remanent Sunday effects: 
 
ccal01 - slot4 -SMX 1 - fails calibrations: fixed by recycling 
                        SMXR VME power. 
ccal02 - slot5 - All SMX's - fails calibrations: fixed by 
                        recycling SMXR VME power. 
ccal02 - slot4 - sagging 7.5 V rabbit supply. 
                 swapped out supply and still measured sagging 
                 supply.   Mike finds the connector to the  
                 hex box which daisy chains in the 400Hz power 
                 loose and tightens this connection afterwhich 
                 we measure the correct voltage. 
 
Plug and Central all calibrate OK: 
 
 
- NExt swap out several SMD boards based on errors  
reported by larry's Ymon.sum files using the 2 M collision 
run taken Wed night.   (NOTE:  we notice that the errors 
reported in the YMOn.sum file stay the same even after 
the SMD boards have been swapped.)  Before we declare 
these boards bad, will wait for input from Larry .

board and the SMXR-SMD cable connections.   Everything looked 
OK.    
 
Try swapping SMD board for SMX2 
new board 565324-347 
old board 564268-12F 
 
West phi=16: 
SMX6  
(swapped the SMD card for this channel by accident - should have 
been West phi=13) 
new board 565374-379 
old board     564270-131 
 
West phi=22: 
SMX6  
channels 1-5 look to have dead preamps.  Swap the preamp card. 
new 509 
old 314 
 
East phi=1 
SMX0,1,2  - These channels all calibrate ok and the pedestal 
rms looks ok, so preamps are most likely alive. 
 
In collision data, though there are some dead regions which 
look like cables not connected or skewed.   
Wires 26-32 - SMX2 
Strips 22-42 - SMX0,SMX1  (these channels are dead spottedly.) 
We checked preamp cards - they were correct and plugged in 
ok.  both signal cables and smxr-smd cables all appear  
connected.   
 
East Phi=10: 
Strip cable 64-80 not completely plugged in. Fixed. 
 
East phi=22: 
SMX1 (cess cable 32-48 appears skewed in collision data; 
channels 32-38 have no signal) 
SMX2 (cesw cable 1-16 appears skewed in collision data; 
channels 1-6 have no signal). 
WE checked cable connections and they all seems OK.   
 
Replace termination board in West phi=8

<pre>NOVEMBER 30 - 2001 (entry from elog) 
------------------- 
 
SMX work:  
 
  We swapped a SMD board on West 16 (SMX2), replaced  
a cpr preamp card on West 22, checked cables on East 1,  
and east 22 (they looked ok even though are some dead  
spots observed in collision data), fixed a loose cable   
on East 10,  and fixed a 15V connector on East 1.  
 
We also replaced the termination board to West 8.  
We finished up with calibrations and all smx crates  
looked good (except for a few bad channels here and there).

----------------- 
SMX - we installed protection diode circuits on showermax  
preamps for East phi=1.   We also swapped 2 plug SMD   
boards which were giving errors.

----------------- 
SMX - PSM problem   
  am alerted  by shift crew and steve kuhlmann that the PSM is  
showing an alarm for the -7.5 V  
for 15W.   After looking at the display, notice that almost  
all the PSM channels on the central south arches are reading  
purple (not reading out) so suspect the -7.5 reading is not  
real.   Especially since at noon, we were able to calibrate  
all the SMX with no errors from 15W.    
 
We try power cycling the   
power to the BNB modules to these supplies, but that doesn't  
fix the readout.     
 
  We had worked on the north arches today, but nowhere near  
the south arches.    will require futher thought.

------------------ 
Worked on the PSM monitoring problem for the south central  
arches.   Expect one of the BNB connectors in the daisy-chain  
(24 in the chain) is broken and dragging the voltage down  
for the whole path.   Didn't have all of the right tools  
to measure voltages at each BNB.  We were able to measure  
the voltage at a mid point in the chain on the SW (the  
west wedges are read first in the chain) and observed a 3V  
difference in the BNB and board ground.  Connected the BNB and  
board grounds through a 100 ohm resister on 14W and now  
we have communication with the west arch.  southeast arches  
still out of communication.  need another access to fix this.

DECEMBER 16, 2001 (entry from elog) 
------------------ 
 
Worked on the PSM readout problems on the east central arches.  
Diagnoised problem and found bad board on east 16.  Improved   
grounding and checked voltages on all wedges.     
Also swapped a bad termination board on Wphi=8.  All BNB  
modules now reading on central arches (except Ephi=12) which  
we masked off.  Have to solve that problem at a later date.
