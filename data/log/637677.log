<pre>Store #5809 is still spinning. We take data, Run 255224. According to run coordinator e-log "The plan is to keep the store 5809 in as long as the experiments feel that it is useful." The work on the Pelletron will continue until 15:00 hrs today. New beams are expected at 16:30 hrs.</pre>

momentary SI. nothing obvious! VNODE2 has a 'Information' pop up 'Error Number -xxxxxxxxx. A network transaction is in progress.' I acknowledged and 'Skipped All'. also P-bar AgGaps has shot to ~18kHz once. So it is most probably due to this. The nominal value for the P-bar Ag Loss is 12kHz.

RC was stuck in HALT mode. Abort was the only actuve button. manually overide the state manage to end the run and restarting.

i checked the EVB proxy and SCPUs. evme05 was out of sync. somehow in the rush i forgot to clean up EVB after ending the run as the instructions says. i checked the SCPUs. all are up. still warns about possible out of sync in evme05. i am not seeing any erros so far.

Weird XMON warning canvases still observed. 
 
As already reported by CO of previous shift, XMON shows several canvases which are in a directory called Warning and which are all red. They have messages like: "ERROR found by SL1D Monitor: Unprescaled L2 trigger 129 L2_TWO_EM16 is firing at a rate of 0.0 hz. You should double check all of the L2 trigger rates!". 
I checked the trigger rates in XMonSummary web page and they look ok. For instance, for the above example:  
129  L2_TWO_EM16 -1    4835    1.10    1.09    25.61    24.78 26.41Â±5.38  -0.15 => the trigger rate is ~ 1.1Hz and the xsec is well within expectations. 
We tried to restart XMon (this solved the problem during last shift) but the red canvases reappeared again.  
It looks there is some software problem connected with XMon which should be investigated.

The instructions on the canvas say, if there are only a few errors we should just report the problem in the elog. The experts should comment. I'll mention it in the 08:00 am meeting.

<!-- Comment: Wed Dec 19 07;26;34 comment by...Giuseppe -->
The same dead PMT was also observed by eve CO on Dec. 17th shift. From comments by experts reported on e-log for that shift, it depends on geometrical segmentation of that tower and sometimes appear with low statistics. This dead channel typically go away with more statistic. It indeed is gone now ! 
This PHA behavior at low statistics should already have been put on  
CO known problems list.... I'll do that....
