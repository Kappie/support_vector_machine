There are lot unix processes by RUN_USER hanging. It is worth looking into 
respective programs "Why the programs are not exiting out cleanly ?" 
 
Then we can kill the Unix processes. 
 
Thanks, 
 
Anil.

<pre>Miro, Pasha and Rob Snihur report no. of processes reached on cdfoprd.   We also received an email alert about 200 processes reached so the db could not coalesce. 
 
I got lucky and got in but there are many active processes, 
so it's not clear what I could or should kill off.  Many many connections with CDFPROD0 user. 
 
The ProductionExe seems to be not closing connections.  Will have to wait for the FARMS to finish to free up some of the processes. 
 
==mail replying to Miro and Rob 
 
Miro is correct, the processes have reached 200 on the cdfofprd, and once 
the number of open connections fall -- others will be available. 
 
Tomorrow a.m. I will take a look and see how many connections we are 
averaging on this instance.  We could consider increasing this number, bu 
we generally like to keep this number at something close to what we ar 
'really' expecting allowing us to monitor if there are connections problems. 
 
I believe 200 is already high.

pasha wants to leave things alone till the morning.   he does not want 
the db bounced.  he does not understand why all of a sudden this is an 
issue, since they have been running fine for quite some time.  i told 
him it  would not be the first time that someone made a change, did not 
inform people and things broke.  he is assuming you and he will touch 
base in the morning.  i called 2080, they said as long as it is not 
effecting data taking, they are fine to leave it till morning.
