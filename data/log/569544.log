<pre>Patrick Thomas Lukens complains that Eugene Edward Schmidt, Jr.
writes confusing elog entries. JJ accepts criticism and tries
again.

The Anti-Proton Source is still not producing pbars.
The accumulator has no current stack of pbars.

JJ's estimate for time to stack from 0 to 125 ma
is 16 hours. JJ's estimate for time to stack from
0 to 160 ma is 24 hours.

The expert for CEM, CHA and WHA came and informed us of a problem that he sees (bad first channel in all 3 systems). He believes it's a problem with the readout program, and not with the detectors themselves; therefore he'll kill and restart the program. This should not interfere with datataking. The expert will update us in about half an hour.

There is still no stack, or any stacking.  We anticipate that this store will run well into tomorrow. We contacted the silicon group (main pager - J. Thom) to put them on notice that tomorrow morning should be a good time for the bias scan study.  They will plan accordingly, and call in the morning before coming in.

Fotis and Nickolai came in and informed us that three channels of the central calorimeter had bad high voltages - off by 100 volts.  No alarm was issued by this condition, and only a subtle color variation in the CEM occupancy plot hinted at the problem (which we only saw in hind sight).  The run was ended, and we must mark it "bad" for CEM/CHA/WHA.  Apparently, they believe the high voltage system was corrupted last night when the PC was reset.  It was described as a "never before seen" event.

<!-- Comment: Sat Feb  7 19;10;30 comment by...Nikolay and Fotis -->
At the end of yesterday's evening shift the pisabox pc was rebooted
because of problems with the heartbeat. At that moment the readout program was on a state of reading the system. This somehow put the system in a funny state for the first pmt of the readout for each subsystem. We observed that the HV for CEM 0W-0R, CHA 0W-0R and WHA 0W-6R were at 228, 216 and 163V lower than the nominal values (probably at the lower reachable limit of each pisa box but we are no sure for the actual value). Checking with YMON we saw that the occypancy of these pmts (at least for CEM and CHA) were lower than their partners. We reset the nominal values and instruct the shift crew to start another run. Since an alarm is set if there are more than 10 channels out of a 5V tolerance the only indication for something being wrong was the  asymmetric bars on the HV status display. We'll implement asap an alarm to prevent such kind of incidents.

Gervasio made an extensive entry in the TOF e-log 
<a href= 
'/cgi/elog/det-system-elog.pl?nb=tof&action=view&page=15&frame=2&anchor=18:51:07'>here</a>, but to summarize:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>The two spares Matt and Gervasio tried (the TOF spare and then the plug spare) 
did not work because they had not set the crate ID to 1.  Once we did this with the 
plug crate (with some difficulty as explained below), it worked correctly.</li> 
<li>Unfortunately, we found the channels in the the card in slot 0 could not be 
turned on in this crate.  We tried two different cards with the same result, so the  
mainframe slot is the suspect.</li> 
<li>Also, this plug spare had others problems: using the front panel buttons to 
debug, we found that if any button was pressed in more than momentarily, the  
CAEN immediately froze.  Sometimes just touching or tapping on the front of 
the CAEN resulted in the same freeze.</li> 
<li>The TOF spare is very old with a completely different front panel.  Daniele also 
thinks it is running with very old firmware.  We need to work on the CAEN mainframe spare situation.</li> 
<li>Lastly, Gervasio also found one new channel (crate 2, slot 7, channel 1) which 
was not reading back current.  In the end, Gervasio thought it would be more  
confusing leaving HV on for the TOF with so many bad channels, and so currently 
the HV is off.</li>

If we have to start a new run, please switch the  
trigger table to PHYSICS_2_01[4,414,424] (it contains 
additional debugging printouts for L2 problems).  
If anything appears wrong or unusual, switch back 
to the 413 table - otherwise use the 414 version for 
any physics running. 
 
If we have to start a new run anytime after midnight, please: 
 
1) Test TEST_ALPHA_CLUSTERING_NOSPIKES[2,409,403] 
   * Start with run configuration AAA_CURRENT 
   * Switch trigger table to  
       TEST_ALPHA_CLUSTERING_NOSPIKES[2,409,403] 
   * If anything appears grossly wrong, stop the test, 
     otherwise run for 20-25 minutes 
 
2) Do ZERO bias run for CLC 
   * Start with run configuration AAA_MINBIAS 
   * Under Triggers, select L1,2 Special Trigger Type 
     (decoupled from L3) Then select ZERO_BIAS_90HZ[2,412]  
      and [403]L3_PASS_ALL_RECO... 
   * Please take about 300k zero bias events. 
   * If any problems, return to regular physics running. 
 
If we have not started this work by 0500 on Sunday owl 
shift, please end physics run and do 1) and 2) and then 
return to physics running with the PHYSICS_2_01[4,414,424] 
table. 
 
If store is scheduled to run until at least noon, we  
will so Silicon Bias Scan for last 3 hours of store.</pre></td></tr></td></table>

<font color=red>Shift Summary: </font><pre>Inherited run 178881 - running without TOF, which had a high voltage problem 
 
Central Calorimeter experts came in and informed us that the first three high voltage channels on each of CEM, CHA and WHA were way off.  They reset the voltages, and we stopped run 178881.  They advised setting the data "bad" for the calorimeter. I have decided to let more experts decide on this one, so the goodrun list has not been entered for this run. 
 
Lots of problems in Pbar and the booster this shift.  Stacking	began around 21:30.  Current plan has this store in until Sunday afternoon. 
 
Lum = 18E30 
Stack =	30 mA
