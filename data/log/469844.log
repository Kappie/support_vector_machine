<pre>Rebooting (for Frank's new changes to take effect): 
ccal, wcal, pcal, cot, l1 and l2. 
Problems with b0pcal02. (didn't work, had to do reset_crate. 
Robin told. 
Use source ~cdfdaq/int, while in integration database mode...) 
 
Greg Feild has Fred for another 1 or 2 hours. We'll amuse  
ourselves with calibrations in the meanwhile...</pre>

Still on b0pcal02:

problem occured when I SYSreseted all pcal crates from 
daqmon...


<!-- Comment: Tue Oct 10 20;26;33 comment by...R. Erbacher -->
<br><i>During access Rick and I  performed "reset_crate" from b0dau30,
(which is aliased to: java resetcrate.ResetDriver), <b>10 times</b> and we were not able to put the b0pcal02 power supply into fault (as is the case here-- see below).  However, as soon as
the SYSRESET button was pushed from the daqmon it went into fault.
Does sysreset use a different mechanism?</i>
<!-- Comment: Tue Oct 10 22;20;24 comment by...patrick -->
All remote resets invoke exactly the same function on
the reset crate cpu via a remote call. Hard to
imagine why this happens.

<pre>CALIBRATION/DATABASE/COT/INTEGRATION 
 
** The switch was made to running with the online integration database.  
 
While trying to run the COT calibration, Bill Orejudos  
and Jack Cranshaw ran into problems writing to the database.  
There was a violation of the primary key uniqueness constraint.  
 
 COTCttOCI::doPut(key,cont)  execute failed 
error 60 :ORA-00001: unique constraint (CALIB_INT.COTCTT_PK) violated 
 
(This indicates that either an old table link is being used or  
a channel number is being written multiple times for the same run.) 
 
To test which was causing the problem the database expert  
disabled the primary key and a run was taken (100957). It ran  
successfully and wrote to the database. Neither the table  
link nor the channel numbers seemed to be causing the problem,  
so the primary key was re-enabled. Another run was taken  
(100958) and also wrote to the database successfully. The  
results were checked with DBANA. 
 
Summary: The problem disappeared, cause unknown. This will need  
to be checked after switching back to the production database. 
 
** Data written to the integration database is unstable and  
may disappear</pre>

<pre>I've checked TrigMon running online in development against the latest version of CalTrigger in TrigSim and found that they match.  I think it is better to say not that TrigMon is running an obsolete version of CalTrigger, but that the COs are being instructed to run an obsolete version of TrigMon in the control room when they "setup cdfsoftb0".  Due to the rapidly evolving nature of TrigMon and TrigSim, I believe it is better for the COs to attempt to run TrigMon in development before falling back on a frozen release.</pre>
