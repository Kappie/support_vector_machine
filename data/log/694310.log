We have been told to ignoreb the alarm

We had a gas alarm when the IMU flush started (red button, siren). Its now yellow.

<pre>The crates b0vrb00 -to- b0vrb05, and b0clk00, b0res00, b0res01 
are red as shown in VXMON. The other crates would appear red 
for awhile and then changed back to green again. Will check 
with Arnd about this when he comes in.</pre>

Yeongdae Shong, the muon HV expert took a look into the missing HV heartbeat for the muon copmponents problem. He is trying to diagnose the problem. The muon computer downstairs seems to be working fine but the Monitor does not to comunicate. He is working on the problem now.

The Gas system has been iun warning for some time already. This is because the flamable gas is being dumped and replaced by nitrogen. We were told to ignore this warning by the cryo people. 
 
The Water system gave an alarm and we have notified the cryo people about it. They are looking into it. As a result the SVX tripped. ISL was having temperature oscillations and was close to a trip, while monitoring it with the silicon  eexperts the SVX tripped.  
 
The HVAC system also gave an alarm, but returned to normal just now. Cryo people were informed. They are very busy people right now.

Regarding the muon HV heartbeat problems, Youngdae finally 
answered the pager. He said he did not have the oportunity 
to work on it yet but today he would try to Fix it. Him being  
the expert I will just wait until it is fixed by him.

Finally, the Plug is still being worked on, so we lost the  
heartbeat on its HV monitors.

<h3>Cooling water problems:</h3> 
<p /> 
There were various water alarms and silicon cooling alarms.  On looking deeply into Phil's puppy-dog eyes, I went down to inquire further in the cryo area.  The system tech was off dealing with the problem, but when he came back he told us that apparently all the chillers and evaporators turned (tripped?) off simultaneously.  He had gone and reset them.  I pointed out one evaporator was still off; he reset that one, also. 
<p> 
Andy Hocker, meanwhile, had had problems with the silicon cooling compressor complaining about a HPS (high pressure side?) problem.  Once the cooling water out of the chillers (TE66) came down to around 50 degrees F., Andy could reset the compressor.

In the unending quest to remove all error message from the iFIX Global Alarms, I went upstairs and checked the end plug HV monitoring, only to find it was frozen.  In the end, I had to ^C out of both the server and client programs, shutdown iFIX, restart iFIX, restart the server and client, check groups and parameters, and start the plug HV monitoring.  It all looks OK now.

BMU HV was turned off in preparation for the access. We had two cooling related problems. The first caused L00 and SVX to trip. ISL was also turned off at this time. Silicon people decided to leave it off. The second took out the solenoid. That was caught on the way down and was back up shortly. Plug HV work continues. Kuhlmann, Colman, Kuhlman and Dawson worked on the isolation trigger and are finished for now. But Greg, Maria and Carla are still working on the trigger. There were some problems with ifix not communicating with the hv control programs. These were eventually all fixed. Pitts is back tomorrow.
