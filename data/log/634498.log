<pre>16:45 George Ott pages Steve Hahn about IMU 400 Hz for the IMU  
ASD crates; George sees no pilot lights on the crates with the camera. He sees no levels on the ECL differential outputs to the TDC inputs. They may have had a shunt trip during the flammable gas or power glitches earlier; Steve will come back and check.</pre>

can be recovered with a HRR, and it runs for several hundred

Error messages are seen in the error log file coming from 
b0eb14. This is the East side of the TDCs.

Data is not read out of the VRBs after this error and the data coming from PCAL04 fills the TRACER fifo.

This leads to the busy timeout... 

The problem is not with PCAL04 but the TRACER/VRB or ?? 
connection associated with the COT crates.

The first two 32 bit words of the event,
which contain the total byte count, somehow
disappeared when they were read. The next
two words (0x000c000c/0x00d401f8) were then
interpreted as the total word count.

<pre>Stan Thompson (SOS) notices that the rack monitoring has turned red for 2RR29C, the crate fanout rack next to the L1 trigger racks. It's tagged by Peter W. to be off, so it looks ok; but 
in investigating Bill Ashmanskas notices that the fan failure  
light in 2R30C bottom is on- fans are turning- needs to be  
looked at though. </pre>

<!-- Comment: Mon Oct 16 21;49;12 comment by...Ashmanskas -->
I think the lockout actually applied to a power supply
unrelated to the clock fanout crate, and that the clock
fanout crate is not intended to be locked out.  Perhaps
lockout tags should be dated?  This crate was definitely
powered on until some time early Monday (else SVT would
have had no clocks).

taught us how to go to page E48 and turn alarms off

to change things). No beam in machine- alarms probably due 
to power glitch etc. Channel 13 doesn't work- they're testing

All of the SVT crates were supposed to be reserved for exclusive

had to up the threshold to 100,000 Hz on each before they  
would reset. Paul says these are no longer in the abort

16:45 George Ott reports there are no ECL levels coming up from downstairs 
from the IMU; Looking with the cameras he also doesn't see any status lights  
on the crates in the collision hall. Steve Hahn comes in and investigates. 
 
16:47 Add SVTMON to run at Subir's and Marco's request. Testing to understand 
possible problems when run with Hardware EVB. 
 
17:28 Hyunsoo asks if we know why the HV is off on CMU West; we don't, so he 
turns it on. 
 
17:21 Reset SVX ACNET rad alarms- not due to beam. We reset it following  
instructions from Paul Derwent. 
 
21:00 Three requests from the SciCo: 
        1. can we get a telephone for the SciCo desk? 
        2. can I help get the TV channels for the stacking etc? 
        3. Can somebody please get rid of this silly Netscape bookmark message? 
 
21:00 Ran 2-JET_2_TEST and CMU_LOW_PT_DPHI_120 tables. Used the 
TAG=6 and Kirsten's new 56 L3 table- had errors- see Elag. 
 
23:00 MCR calls to tell us they can't put beam in due to 2 inhibits from us- 
SVX4MR and SVX6MR. Paul Derwent leads us through resetting them (see Elog). 
 
23:55 Situation is that COT19 is still giving troubles- Eric James looked at 
it, but it's still a problem. Other COT crates seem to be giving problems 
too- last run hung after 17 events. Protons in Tevatron on and off. 
We hand it to Owl shift.
