<pre>First of all, it took 3 minutes for me to make this shift entry. 
 
Stop run, release L3 because of Electrical work on 3rd floor. 
 
Frank C. and Tom P. debugging various COT readout issues. 
 
There is some air in the portcard cooling (from rupture 
of ISL line yesteday) + a new leak in an SVX cooling line.</pre>

Steve at Cryo calls. They will be working on CDFS4 (controls 
solenoid) most of the shift. We will probably see some alarms.

<pre>CMX experts have switch the HV cables for wedges 18-19 and 20 for CMX NE miniskirts.  This means that HV channel  1 --> 7 and vice versa.  Turning on HV.

<pre>I am trying to restart the calib consumer proxy but had problems logging into b0dap62 from b0dap52. 
 
I did a kticket and the ssh b0dap62 -l cdfcalib 
however it still asked me for a password. The only work around was to login as cdfdaq and then ksu cdfcalib on b0dap62. 
 
Could someone investigate this?</pre>

Roberta D. has replaced the power supply for "the  
crate in the West Alcove". We believe that this is 
FCAL_1W. We need someone to replug in the cards and 
check that everything is OK as soon as possible. Roberto 
will also replace the power supply on the east side soon.

I investigated the SRC errors from last night, and I concluded that none of them were actually real. Most came up as a consequence of power-cycling the TS crate, and one happened amdist a TDC problem bonanza. Interested parties can

Restored ~1330 except for BMU. BMU monitoring is disabled because they've disabled their CAENs while they're working. They will re-enable it when they're done. Apparently, this turns the global alarms box light blue.

<pre>It looks like the l2 alpha (b0l2pr01) was using the same  
ip address as the web server. This would explain the slow 
response to the web server and possibly the problems we were seeing with the consumer state manager and other places... 
 
An Alpha was recently swapped in with a MAC address that  
was assigned to the ip address of the web server. 
 
We changed this to a free ipaddress. The ipaddress is assigned 
in the bootptab, where the file lists the MAC address and the  
associated ip address.

<font color=red>Shift Summary: </font><pre>(1) Frank C, Tom P, and Dave A. worked on TDC readout most 
of the shift. Fixed a few problems. A few problems remain 
still (with COT05, COT06, COT11..new) 
(2) Work on XFT crates continues in parallel 
(3) Work on silicon cooling leaks in Collision Hall 
(4) Some upgrades to the Solenoid control were performed. 
   Magnet now back at full field 
(5) Cryo cycled through all of their monitoring computers  
   (S1 - S6) doing some upgrades/checks. 
(6) Sections of L3 on and off for electrical work on 3rd floor. 
(7) Main fileserver, b0dau30 down for servicing 
(8) Some work was done on HV monitoring. Should be working 
   except for BMU (disconnected while working on CAEN supplies). 
(9) Most calibrations were done. Calibrations NOT DONE: 
 
     BSC QIE: b0fcal00 crate errors  
     PLUG LASER: HV controls have been disabled on vnode 1 and I wasn't  
      sure if I can go up and turn them on, or whether they are off  
      for a reason.  
      PMT SPIKE RUN:cot test are using hardware evb/L3 
(10) Problem with very long response of online system to e-log entries  
   (especially Start of shift ) believed to be due to the fact that 
   one of the Level 2 Alpha boards had the same IP address as the web 
   server 
(11) The main server (b0dau30) for the DAQ down ~ 15 min for servicing. 
(12) Silicon Cooling now OK again - Andy Hocker 
(13) L2 Torture test with 3TT in XTRP is ongoing. 
(14) George Wyatt spent the last few days fixing two broken CAEN reset lines  
   for the silicon. They have been tested and work fine. 
(15) Emergency lights behind the L3 display (2RR14C) do not appear to  
    be functional. Called George Wyatt, but it is Craig Olsen who should 
    see that it's fixed.</pre>

<!-- Date: Thu Oct 30 15:54:08.367 2003 -->
<pre>We strung a set of signal cables from the bottom ASD crate to  
stacks 30-35 on the bottom CMP.  This was done to bypass a 
 broken signal cable for CMP bottom stack 32.  By doing this we 
 have fixed one dead channel in the CMP.  
 
This is a kludge which will remain in place at least until the 
 next long shut-down period (at the moment we cannot locate any 
 surplus CMP signal cable, so the CMX folks were kind enough to 
 lend us some for the time being).   
 
Since the new signal cable length is probably different from 
 that which was originally in place, we can expect the t_0 to 
 change for stacks 30-35 on CMP bottom.  The t_0 change can be 
 handled by the calibration database.</pre>

<ul><li>once more into the subfloor for the gipper (as another shirt bites the dust)...</li> <li>The kludge may remain; but, if we leave the cable as is, we have to dress the cable at both ends so it moves with the miniskirt. That may be the way to go, but I want to look at the end of the old cable I haven't looked at yet before giving up, as well as the way we strung it to see if there is a better way. We ran out of time today. And we need to confirm with the data overnight that we did fix it.</li></ul>
