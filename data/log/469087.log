Running L2 torture
<!-- Author: Sergo -->

Got Heap Corrupt error for crate b0svt08. Shepherded the crate. After shepherding had to bring it to the Halt state ( from Ready state) and recovered the run.

I'm getting very high deadtime running L2 torture. Looks strange but my guess was that it's due to the collisions from TeV studies.  We'll check on that right after TeV finishes studies.
<!-- Author: Sergo -->
<!-- Comment: Fri Oct 21 03;45;02 comment by...Sergo -->
Searched the e-log. Found couple of entries saying that L2torture with beam in tevatron gives high deadtimes. Looks like we're fine, but I'll still double check after TeV studies.  


<!-- Comment: Fri Oct 21 04;28;14 comment by...Sergo -->
 As soon as beam was dropped deadtime immediately dropped to ~5%. So, our assumption was correct and everything is fine.

 I kept getting non-responding crate b0cmx00. Shepherd and visiondemo reset didn't help. Dale was around so I asked him about this - he basically suggested same ( shepherd and  reset ) . He told me to try this crate with cosmics and if it's fine then just leave message in the e-log. Otherwise page TDC people.
<!-- Comment: Fri Oct 21 07;20;38 comment by...Sergo -->
by the way, SoftEvb Proxy Viewer window got frozen. I couldn't close it. I also didn't know how to kill this java window without killing other ones - checked with John - he didn't know either. It's just a viewer so I don't think it can cause any problems.
<!-- Comment: Fri Oct 21 07;48;30 comment by...Sergo -->
this crate is fine with L2torture and cosmics, seems to be a problem only during calibrations. Hopefully experts will take a look at this later

MCR changed plan: they will inject beam right now; later, there will be a dry squeeze and therefore we will get some quiet time then.

<font color=red>Shift Summary: </font><pre>EOS studies ongoing. L2 torture test run: we observe high 
dead time, which drops when the beam is aborted. 
 
0425 - Beams aborted. We are granted one hour quiet time. 
      Decided to take quiet time calibrations (in 
      particular plug laser) 
0435 - Stack stashed into Recycler; after transfer, stack 
      at 8.5E10, Rbeam 169E10. Delay due to trip in 
      transfer line. 
0525 - Granted another half an hour of quiet time. Repeat 
      CLC calibrations and try to complete plug laser, 
      which are slow and do not output file on database. 
      Expert called, problem not solved. 
0610 - Shot setup underway. We switch to non quiet time 
      calibrations. 
 
While taking calibrations, b0cmx00 did not pass 
configuration transition; shepherding and resetting did not 
help. Following Dale's suggestion, ace decides to verify if 
this is a problem affecting calibrations only. If not, page 
muon TDC expert. 
We are able to run cosmics, but with high dead time (there 
is no beam in the machine); this was already noticed in the 
previous shift. Decided to go back to L2 torture test, 
which we say in the night was well-behaving. Need to restart 
CSL, but after that, L2 torture test ok. 
 
0755 - Shot setup underway. 
 
End of shift: 
Stack: 41E10, Stacking rate: 7-13mA/h, Stash: 169E10.
