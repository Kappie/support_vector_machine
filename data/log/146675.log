  3. if IN2 finished 
     S4IN 
     S4CEN 
     S4OUT (also needs PS) 
 
 
EAST 
---------- 
  ISL east 
   1. L005 - needs debug 
   2. OUT1 - missing junction card 
   3. OUT0 - debug - LV cable ? 
 
  SVX east 
   1. S5IN - PS problem - document and fix 
             then RTV 
   2. S2IN - plug  
      S0CEN - plug 
      S0OUT - plug ( PS being installed)

<pre>Interlock for SB1W2 re-cabled before starting the plugging procedure,  
after WiB and LB test. It is probably a flaky connection, as 
on the sw side interlocks are fine (Matt reports it). 
Andy was paged, he says it's bad enough to be fixed tomorrow... 
not earlier.</pre>

Tested successfully with LoadBox (L00 old) and with WiB. 
Plugged in. The card was tight ! hard time in plugging. 
Not tested because of interlock problem. 
 
SB1W3 
Started testing with Load Box when probably quadlock tripped 
the 400 Hz power.  
About 10 min earlier control room called about an ISL trip.</pre>

<p> 
Got paged from the control room because of an ISL dew point trip. 
As I was walking the shifter through the recovery procedure, power 
to the racks was lost.  Again there was no trip latched in the Quadlog.  Roser has set up some kind of detailed data logging for these mysterious trips so we should be able to learn something tomorrow about why this is happening.  Anyway I asked for the cryo room to be notified of the rack trip so that they can reset it.

<pre>ISL B5W1 tested with LIB and WIB. Fib had to be swapped (see 
entry above) but otherwise this is ready for plug in.</pre>

<pre>WIB testing SB3W2 (aka S2IN).  Initializes OK, but 
occasional RO errors.  Errors are a motley collection, 
but mostly Not CHIP ID.  Happens in ~5% of events.  
When the not chip id error happens, it happens in all 
layers.  It does not matter what layers or combination 
of layers we have turned on, even reading singly.  Also 
swapped FIB timing cable with SB3W1, which did not cure 
the problem.  Swapping WIB also did not help. 
 
	Diagnosing this as an FTM problem for SCN 
to enjoy in the morning, and we will in the meantime move 
on. </pre>

<table border=0><td><tr><td bgcolor=#e0e030><pre>Summary 0:00-8:00 WEST bore: 
---------------------------- 
 
Plugged in SB1W3, OFTM channel 1 bad: does not init, but currents  
change and RO ok, this is nailed down to be the OFTM! 
This wedge has the big ground braid. 
 
Test SB1W2 after plugging by Saverio: everything fine,  
but cannot run L1 with full bias since it draws more than  
50uA (which is already known from Sidet) and the current  
limit is 50. I don't know how to change that... But this  
layer runs unbiased, so no problems expected, but limit  
needs to be changed! 
This wedge has also a big ground connection. 
 
Plugged in SB0W3: LIB test shows non-linearity of L2 and L4  
at low voltages? From 50-40V they go down by 20% in the current, 
but from 40V to 20V they change more like down to a third than  
to half... 
WIB test shows that OFTM channels 5 and 8 are bad! Channel 5  
did not init and channel 8 has a stuck bit (CAP ID errors). 
This JC is plugged in slightly skewed since in between the  
rails of SB0W3 and SB0W4 there seems to be some epoxy which  
blocks off the right edge of the JC, but decided to run it  
anyway and everything seems to be fine. 
This wedge also has a big ground strap. Connected SB1W3 and SB0W3  
grounds together, unfortunately we didn't save the histos from  
SB1W3, but we compared layer 3 rails from SB0W3 before and after  
the ground connection was done and it looked like the rails  
went down from ~1 count to below 0.5 counts! That is pretty  
good news! 
 
SB0W2 JC connected to cable bundle, check list prepared, waiting  
for LIB and for the online computers to go down... 
 
 
FINAL REMARK: the old SVX LIB disappeared and the new one  
doesn't work, all tests were performed with the L00 LIB!

<pre>Owl Summary East Side 5/15/01 
 
	The evening go off to a rousing start with 
an ISL trip and FIB rack cooling trip.  We recovered 
from these around 0130.  However, b0fib04 continued 
to give us trouble after the trips were cleared; we 
could not download maps and handshake properly.   
It refused to reboot either from a session in the 
crate or from b0dap19.  FIB crate rebooted at rack by 
pressing RST button. 
 
	Returned to SB3W5 (I believe my logbook 
entry of 10:59 5/13 has typo) to check out earlier PS 
difficulties.  The difficulty at the time was 
that it was not possible to turn off L3 DVDD. 
After turning off GUI, it still drew 800 mA. 
At the time, it still wouldn't turn off after 
turning off interlocks, removing enable cable,  
or even power-cycling the crate (As we just 
couldn't kill it, I submit the appellation "Crate Dracula".) 
However, tonight we repeated the test, and there were no problems  
with the PS.  So we conclude it is now OK. 
 
	LIB and Blinky-light tested SB3W2 (S2IN).  It 
does not have a big shiny new ground braid.  As  
detailed in earlier log entry, it initialized OK, 
but about 5% of events gave RO errors on all DOIMs. 
Otherwise the RO was fine.  We swapped the timing cable 
and WIB, so they are both exonerated, as are the DOIM 
cables, since most RO is fine, and channels are not failing 
individually.  We concluded the problem was somewhere  
at the FIB crate, and decided to move along without 
plugging it. 
 
	We moved on to SB4W0 (S0CEN).  It passed the 
LIB and blinky light test, and then failed RO in the 
same way as S2IN. Different FTM, different cable bundle. 
We decided to--move on. This JC has a ground braid. 
	 
	Finally we tried SB5W0 (S0OUT).  It passed 
the LIB and blinky light test, then failed RO in the same 
way as the last two.  This was the end of our shift. 
This JC has a ground braid. 
 
	Probably all three of these JC's are pluggable. 
WIBs read out fine when they weren't hiccuping. 
It would be nice if someone like Steve or Mary could 
determine exactly what happened.  My (ADF) guess is that 
rebooting the crate again and doing quick WIB tests is 
the way to go.

I am out of part.  However, I was able to place enables for
most of the NW SVX crates today.  On the NE SVX crates the
users will still have to plug the enable in for themselves.

B4 = Enable 2
B5 = Enable 3</pre>

<pre>Tested SB3W6: Power supply would not turn off failure 
 
Inserted failed power supply. Connected cables and enable. 
Turned on power supply using front panel and turned power 
supply off. No channels on according to CAEN front panel or  
red LED. 
 
Turned on GUI.  No channels on according to GUI.  Turned on 
power supply using GUI and turned power supply off.  No 
channels on according to GUI, front panel and LED.   
 
Turned on power supply using GUI and removed enable cable. 
Power supply tripped.  No channels on according to GUI, front 
panel and LED.   
 
Conclusion: problem is not reproducible. 
Note that one difference is that the power supply is not 
connected to the wedge. 
 
We should make plots of the spy information to see if there 
is any additional information there.</pre>

<table border=0><td><tr><td bgcolor=#e0e030><pre>This is the report of a not so efficient night in the WEST bore: 
================================================================ 
 
first of all: Dave et al worked until 2:30 in order to  
understand the ISL and L00 problems but didn't come to the  
point to bless them, I think for the L00 they want the PS to  
be swapped since they see rather large currents... 
  
We worked on SB0W2 
it has a ground strap 
it LIB tested ok, the new PS seems to be fine. 
 
blinky lights ok, but with WIB#1 nothing inits, the currents  
don't seem to change and nothing gets read back! 
 
in order to debug this we basically swapped the complete  
inventory in the west around: 
all the following steps didn't help, if not leaving Jeff  
and me fairly confused...: 
 
swapped to L00 WIB;  
swapped FIB command cable from SB0W11; 
swap almost everything with SB0W3, which is already plugged and  
works: 
  FIB cable, 
  one DOIM at the OFTM, 
  one DOIM at the bore; 
swapped to test ("SVX compatible") JC; 
run this wedge in the lower half of the OFTM/FIB and SB0W3 in the  
upper;   
 
 
 
NEXT step for day shift: 
------------------------ 
Use SB2W10 to ensure that WIB#1 works! 
From there on swap one by one back to SB0W2: 
the JC; 
the PS+power cables; 
the FIB cable+DOIMs; 
 
Somehow this wedge reminds us to the infamous LIB test passing  
LV cables which wouldn't show anything wrong but which would  
fail the WIB test completely!
