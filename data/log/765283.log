We got a solenoid problem. It start to rump down. Now the alarm is cleared by cryo but we are not able to have the amps information from the solenoid2 pc.
<!-- Author: Giorgio -->
<!-- Comment: Sun May 16 01;31;08 comment by...Giorgio -->
Now the solenoid current is at the nominal value, but still we don't konw what was causing the problem.

<!-- Comment: Sun May 16 01;36;48 comment by...Giorgio -->
<pre>
We were (are) getting some warning from Ifix program running on
solenoid2 workstation. 

The warning are of the type:
" Warning Error Number 1914
  HTRDATA.HTCWATCHDOGTIMERALARM.F_CV:
  Connection NOT estabilished with node. "

Generally while we are getting this warning the AMPS reading is 
something like "@@@@@ AMPS".

This warning is used to clear by itselft after few seconds.
</pre>

<pre>
The ifix solenoid control windows in solenoid2 pc had some problems: the AMPS are not updated. We tryed to reopen a new solenoid control window w/o success (i.e. the window opened but the information were not updating). We opened another solenoid windows on VNODE2, there values there are updating w/o problems.

For the time begin (after have consulted to cryo) we decided to monitor the solenoid from VNODE2, given the fact that was not possible to restart IFIX from solenoid2 pc without a reboot. 
This is not a big deal given that solenoid control are locked and under the cryo control.

Icicle Hearthbeat is missing from Global alarm window in VNODE1, 
but icicle seems to be running. We will keep an eye on this.

<!-- Comment: Sun May 16 02;07;21 comment by...Giorgio -->
Icicle was having problem updating information. In the icicle window there were some errors like "error reading tag ... 
connection not estabilished with node...". So we decided to kill the process and to restart another one, now it seems to work.

<pre>Interestingly, I noticed that the conection to b0dap85 was closed on b0dap59, even though AcNet was running on that session, is it normal? I can ping b0dap85, anyway, I haven't received any error or warning related to AcNet...</pre>

<pre>Later on, we got a warning that TevMon is not receiving data through AcNet. We checked and b0dap85 was still running. We didn't received any more warning and tevMon was updating, so we just ignored the message. Although, just to be on the safe side, I checked if we saw any process that consists of acnet is running on b0dap85, we had quite a few acnet* and one "acnet" running...</pre>

Proton losses now @ 60kHz, abort gap around 43kHz.

<!-- Comment: Sun May 16 04;41;17 comment by...Rob Harr -->
This looks even messier than the previous store!  Anyway, we can't ramp the detector with these losses.  We'll wait until the situation improves.

<!-- Comment: Sun May 16 05;10;08 comment by...Giorgio -->
Abort gap around 16kHz, but lostp around 70kHz. MCR is going to rescrape.

We had a PEM, PHA and PSH alarm. We tried to follow the recovery procedure to recover the problems (i.e. by power cycling the systems from HV summary). This did not work. We are going to check the hardware at the 3rd floor.

<!-- Comment: Sun May 16 07;28;43 comment by...Giorgio and Shabnaz -->
<pre>We checked the hardware at the 3rd floor, following the instructions written upstairs and the printout of the instructions from the web. We needed to reset the crate 10 by pressing the yellow button on the hardware box as instructed from the webpage, meanwhile there is a sign on the box which says "Do not press the yellow buttons". we were confused on what order to follow, so we paged Willis. After he called us back, he said that we should press the yellow button and usually this should fix the problem. It did solve the problem after we power cycled the plug calorimeters from the HV GUI in control room.</pre>
