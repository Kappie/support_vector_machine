<!-- Comment: Fri Nov  9 07;56;32 comment by...SCN -->
Hmm, b0dap30 is the file server for the entire linux cluster,
and runs many critical DAQ tasks.  I would encourage
using a different machine if you can find one, lest you
be responsible for bringing down the online system lock stock and
barrel. (Colloquialisms added for the edification of the
non-native English speakers)...

<pre>wrong bias Imax currents in the file, which I spotted while  
trying to turn these ladders on; basically in every wedge where I wanted to bias something I found at least one wrong limit, this sucks! but I won't complain any longer, just don't like my job anymore etc...boooohoooo 
 
here comes the list of too low current limits: 
SB0W3L3 
SB0W5L4 
SB0W8L4 
SB1W4L3 
SB3W0L2 
SB3W3L4 
SB4W10L1,L3,L4 
SB5W3L2 
</pre>
<!-- Author: Petra -->
<!-- Comment: Sun Nov 11 10;00;46 comment by...Saverio -->
<pre>The previous list contains basically ladders that 
were not usually biased.
Therefore the problem is in the choice of the default
 value for ladders that had not been integrated before.
How does the new value compares with the traveler value ? 
Could we have read the default value from the travelers ?
There are two cases of ladders that were biased previously:
SB0W8L4 and SB4W10L3 for which the value that was 
calculated was wrong. I'll look into it when we can bias them.
Right now we need a "persistence" flag on the CAENcurrent file, 
 so that we don't loose the changes we make.</pre>
<!-- Date: Thu Nov 8 17:58:24 2001 -->
<pre>two ladders have probably mixed bias voltages (due to mix on webpage): 
 
here is what they should have applied: 
 
SB2W4L2: 25V 
SB3W4L2: 40V</pre>

<pre>SB0W8L3 suspected pinhole. 
- Power Supply sensitivity changed to coarse. 
Cable measurements: 
Positive to negative: 590 kOhm (black on (-)) or 78 KOhm (black on (+) 
Positive to Reference 1.12 kOhm (b on (-)) or 1.12 kOhm (b on (+)) 
Negative to Reference: 590 kOhm (b on (-)) or 77 kOhm (b on +) 
 
This is consistent with the hypothesis of a pinhole on z side 
 
As reference this is the table for a healthy ladder (L1) 
P/N 600 kOhm  81 kOhm 
P/Ref open  open 
N/Ref open  open

We now find: SVXDAQ 
 
sb0w3, L4 doesn't readback init, dro after 6 chips and data 
           on those 6 chips bizarre 
       rest of wedge passes HST 20K and Svxdaq looks OK

<pre>Gino Bolla, Steve Worm and Matt Herndon: 
Layer 1 and Layer 4 appeared unbiased.  resistance measurements 
showed an open.  Switched bias connectors from SVXII set to 
ISL set by reterminating inner cable and installing an 
extension on the outer cable.  Also discovered that layer 4 
was not biased due to a bent pin on the long junction card. 
Layer 4 now works.  Layer 1 still has on open. 
 
Mad Mary 
Layer 0,3 and 4 have reasonable leakage current.  Layer 2 reads 
0uA.  Nosie measurements demonstrate that Layer 2 is baised as 
well.

<!-- Date: Thu Nov 8 23:29:47 2001 -->
<pre>Result of investigations on SB5W5: 
 
By scanning L1A through PARSTs and charge injecting, Gino is 
pretty sure PARSTs are not getting to this wedge. We can charge 
inject the first few events after initializing but then it  
saturates. Using a bench top mock up we determined that the  
correct wires were cut and connected to the correct pins on 
the fib connector. There is no clear way in which a problem 
on the DDR command bus or the other signals on the Fib cable 
can cause the symptoms we observe, i.e. init successful, readout 
successful but preamp is saturated. MB (thats me) suspects pick 
up on CDATA from FECLK or CCLK which were the two cables cut and  
reconnected. The FECLK and CCLK wires kludged on the JC to bypass 
the short were actually twisted together.</pre>

	&gt; we opened 1 elbow on the West; it's partner was 
	  known open, so this resulted in an open line 
	&gt; we opened 1 elbow on the East; it's partner was 
	  NOT open, so no line was opened.  we ran out of 
	  time (actually, energy) and did not attempt to 
	  open its partner 
	&gt; we now know of 2 elbows on the East whose partners 
	  are known open (ie. we know where to blast next on

  made prisms (so far, all hand made) and making some improve- 
  ments to our tools.</pre>

<p>Lost another power supply down in the trenches today.  It was Private 
LB0W5 from L00 platoon, identification number #01.  He was hit pretty hard 
in his 3.1 bias and lost a lot of voltage (280V).  It looks like there may 
have been some collateral damage on his 3.0 bias as well (30V).  The poor 
kid was fresh out of LIB testing--he hadn't even been cabled yet. We 
medevaced him as quickly as we could, but it doesn't look like he will be 
making it back to the front lines any time soon. Damn this war.

Retested all ISL parts on the west to make sure there were no problems before the plugs close. One new problem was found and 
determined to be a problem with the RX.

I tested SOC. A couple months ago it was dropped from the hardware DB because it failed to initialize. But, I can't find anything wrong with it.

<pre>Bill A and I tested the L2 abort. We ran at ~20kHz with 10 Fib00 
wedges. The abort read seems to be working. We put SB2W3 z-side  
in read all mode to confirm this. At this point we're rate  
limited by SVT decision times. We still seem to receive  
occasional Silicon done timeouts, maybe there are some ladders 
out there which can still confuse fibs. Both SVT and VRB's see 
the timeout so it seems to be the FIB's fault. It occurs for  
both VRB slot 10 and 20 of svx01. (w2-3,a-b) 
 
A couple of notes: I cannot handshake with SB0W2-3 with run  
control doing the configuring. This is the fib whose slot moved. 
I changed the slot of the card in the hwdb but maybe there's more 
to change. 
 
The c8's from the abort come on the odd byte. That is, the VRB  
will terminate with the last data readout being C8, the  
termination character being c8c4. This is probably not important.

<pre>More news on the ISL RTD front.  Mircea says it is the 
channel, not the RTD.  When he puts that RTD into a different 
input channel, it reads out just fine.  We consulted with 
 Andy Hocker, chris Hill and David Stuart and decided to  
 replace the input module.  this RTD is on a non-cooled  
channel, but is right next to a cooled channel and we 
need to be able to momonitor it because of the cross-heating 
that has been observed.</pre>

This morning around 4:00am an RTD read -200 C.(RTD ISL_TE_CCW2L6_1_OUT for experts -bulkhead W2, 6C- WEST, cooling circuit W2.1-note 5553 notation). I turned out to be a broken channel in the RTD module 9, ISL. Even if this RTD is not on a "powerable" part of ISL, it is close to some ladders which will be powered and I decided to replace the module. I have tried to take all the precations to avoid any mistakes when reconnecting all 16 ISL RTDs to new module 9. I have checked also one by one after reconnection. But it is good to be paged if any strange temperature behaviour is seen when the ISL will be powered!
