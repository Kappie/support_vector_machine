<!-- Notes: -->
<pre> 
 o Waiting for Beam 
	-Tevatron is doing proton studies 
         in preparation for a shot. 
        -Expect 2 hours of quiet time before 
         shot setup. 
 
 o Plan: 
      -Cosmics until quiet time 
      -Quiet Time: 
          > CLC needs calibration 
          > other quiet time calibrations 
      - Collisions: 
          > Start with 50K Min. Bias Run 
            Only CLC and Plug needs to be 
            all the way up. Rest of HV can 
            be ramping.

<pre>Here is an update on "the plan" from Ron Moore:

 09:55:13-  

The Plan 
-------- 
* Tev recommissioning continues. 
* LRF1 needs some rest.  Once NTF is done with patient treatment 
at 11:00 (and Tev it is convenient for Tev studiers), LRF1 will 
take a one-hour-ish rest, i.e. no beam. 
* D0 can have a ~30 min controlled access sometime during the 
LRF1 quiet time. 
* If the LRF PAs survive, Tev could be ready for an HEP store 
late day/early evening shift.

<p>Solenoid display and ICICLE both up and running again on SOLENOID2.  And the flashing red CRYO/WTR alarm is gone.</p> 
 
<p>Tried both restarting just iFIX and rebooting SOLENOID2.  In both cases, the CRYO/WTR alarm came back.  However, after rebooting and coming back 10 minutes later, the alarm is gone.  There was never an actual alarm; if you pressed the flashing button, the alarm list came up empty (and still does).</p>

IFix panel for trigger inhibits is broken.  Says that CMU HV is both inhibitting and disabled.  That is an illegal state.  I toggled all signals from HVMON.  Logic worked correctly.  Run control is happy.  If you need to disable the software inhibit, you will need to do it from HVMON until the problem is fixed.  The problem is only with the iFix inhibits panel, not the functioning of the inhibits themselves.

      Summary March 11 Day Shift 
      ========================== 
       
   
   o Waiting for Beam 
       -Cosmics when system is free. 
       -Brought COT HV up. Took short 
        cosmic run with HV up (no Si) 
	and HV inhibits active. 
    
   o CLC 
       -Flowing isobutane 
       -Calibration runs 
        
   o Calibrations 
       -WHA: Nicolay performing 
        source and laser runs. 
       -Performed CLC calibrations 
       -Performed other quiet time 
        calibrations.	 
       -NOTE: New LERS were downloaded 
        but these were done during 
	noquiet time calibrations. 
	(IT HAD NOT BEEN CLEAR FROM 
	THE SOURCE AND LASER RUNS WORK 
	THAT QUIET TIME WAS REQUIRED TO 
	RECOVER FROM THIS WORK. QUIET TIME 
	ENDED PRIOR TO SOURCE AND LASER 
	CAL. BEING COMPLETE.) If we get 
	more quiet time call Mario Spezziga 
	(x5010 office; home 406-5787)   
    
   o Misc. Problems 
       -Steve Hahn fixed a false 
        alarm on Solenoid monitor 
	in control room. 
       -Muon inhibit problem  
          &gt; J.C Yun comes and 
	    believes he fixes this 
	    problem. 
       -Steve Chappa added clock 
        fanout modules as requested 
	by Jonathan Lewis. 
       -Yeongdae Shon was examining 
        problems with HVmon. He thinks 
	the problem was solved.

Yeongdae says the <a href=

'/cgi/elog/elog.pl?nb=2003&action=view&page=203&frame=2&anchor=08:20:37'>(s)</a> with the CMP hv on Sunday morning were most likely that the CMP CAEN mainframe was hung. The <a href= 
'/cgi/elog/elog.pl?nb=2003&action=view&page=206&frame=2&anchor=10:04:53'>thing</a> Hyunsoo and I reported yesterday is being worked on but is clearly a separate issue.

I made WHA source runs:<br> 
#160039 WHA FE LER = 1, Bon, HV default;<br> 
#160060 WHA FE LER = 1, Bon. HV new (IDs 4CB, 4CF, 545);<br> 
Central laser runs:<br> 
#160037  WHA FE LER default, Bon, WHA HV default;<br> 
#160061  WHA FE LER = 1, Bon, WHA HV new (IDs 4CB, 4CF, 545)<br> 
19-W 8L ID 4CB LERnew = 0.9860E+00; HVnew = 1117.0v;<br> 
19-W 9L ID 4CF LERnew = 0.9842E+00; HVnew = 1113.5v;<br> 
21-W 7R ID 545 LERnew = 0.1007E+01; HVnew = 1040.0v;<br> 
As usual the error = 1%(LER);
