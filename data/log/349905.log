<pre>Today's plan: 
 
  - roser/chlebana moving some crates around;  will affect 
   	> RT-server (will incur short downtimes; will have 
	  to move DAQ partition) 
	> consumers 
	> L3 build crate 
    should be done by ~1100 
 
  - xtrp and L3 work until 1100	    [krause,mit] 
 
  - COT tests (tdc and crate work)  [chlebana,phillips] 
    (standalone) 
 
  - silicon tests (checkout)        [svx-gang] 
    (standalone) 
 
  - silicon D-Mode calibrations 
    (needs L1/2/3 and HEVB) 
 
  - Evening: cosmics w/ cot/svx</pre>

for the rack work mentioned above, they are going to move the 
rt-server to b0dap33;  all the crates will need to be rebooted.

<pre>Mary Convery is upgrading the PC which monitors/controls the HV  
for the  CLC/BSC/MNP/RPS.  This may take awhile (days).  In the 
meantime, the Global Alarms page will show these as RED and the 
"H"eartbeat is grey. 
 
Steve suggests we page the CLC fellas b/c he thought the global 
alarms should be grey - perhaps red indicates a problem.</pre>

<pre>We are moving the rtserver from dap78 to dap33. This is needed 
to allow source calibration runs. 
 
We also will move the consumers that are running on dap33 to  
dap78. 
 
We updated the consumer_script/startMon.sh file to start 
the consumers on dap78 
 
We modified the consumer_script/killMon.sh to kill processes 
on the same nodes that were used in the startMon script.

Tom Phillips stops-by to ask that tonight, during cosmic runs 
and/or L2 torture tests, an effort be made to keep in as many of 
the COT crates as possible.  If there are problems (in particular 
w/ crates 3,5,11) PLEASE NOTE THE PROBLEMS IN THE LOGBOOK prior 
to removing them from the run.  They're trying to debug these  
crates.  Also, DON'T AUTOMATICALLY TAKE-OUT THESE CRATES EN  
MASSE (rather, just remove the problem crate).</pre>
