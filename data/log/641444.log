The Vnode1 problem (disk space problem) went away after we moved the tmp files to recycling bin. There were about 2000 files with the name, ~DF*.tmp. This freed up about 400Mbyte from C: disk. Most of the files were created during this month.

Access 
 
Replaced b0cot05 power supply, on south west bottom with a spare.  To do that, we had to open south muon wall, West IMU, and SW CMX arch.   Replacement went fine.   All steel closed back up.

<pre>PEM/PHA/PSH buttons cyan (message out of range) on HV Global Alarms.  PEM heartbeat purple.  Called Mike Lindgren who directed  me to Luciana Malfarreli. 
 
I made two phone calls to Italy. 
 
Luciana told me that she stopped (remotely) the iFix updating on the Plug HV PC upstairs because she suspected work was being done on the Plug.  She restarted the updating and after a while iFix came back. 
 
Luciana is investigating occasional crashes in the HV monitoring program that runs on the Plug HV PC.  The crashes do not happen too often, but some instructions to the monitoring ACE is warranted. 
 
**************************************************************** 
Instructions for the holidays from Luciana to the monitoring ace: 
 
  1. During the day (in Italy, that is) please call Luciana if 
     the Plug HV monitoring program on the Plug HV PC crashes. 
     She would like to debug the crash.  She will restart the 
     program with you.  During sleeping hours, it is preferable 
     to record the error messages and just go ahead and restart 
     the HV monitoring program on the Plug HV PC upstairs. Email 
     the errors to Luciana.  You can also call Luciana if you 
     feel it's necessary.  Her email and phone number is on the 
     calorimeter holiday pager list. 
  2. Willis has written up instructions 
     for starting/stopping/recovering the Plug HV 
     monitoring program. The instructions and password can be 
     found on a sheet of paper sitting next to the Plug HV PC 
     on the 3rd floor.  
  3. There are two distinct processes that are involved in 
     the monitoring: a server program and a client. The client 
     is the one prone to crashing.  When the client crashes, 
     you can either restart the client or restart both 
     processes.  The procedure for doing this is in the 
     instructions mentioned above. 
  4. Killing the HV monitoring program on the Plug PC will NOT 
     affect the plug voltages.  The worst thing that can happen 
     is a complaint (or two)from iFix. 
  5. To prevent crashes, Luciana will be restarting the HV 
     program every morning.  This might temporarily affect the 
     iFix connection.  Go upstairs to the Plug HV PC.  You might 
     see the mouse pointer moving about clicking on things. 
     That would be Luciana doing something.  Be patient.  IFIX 
     might take up to 5 minutes to update.</pre>
