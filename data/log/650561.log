Fotis was just here. He forced several readouts of the problem Pisabox and everything looks fine. He says this is not a usual 
occurence and can only guess at what might have gone wrong 
(line voltage sag? humidity or temperature sensitivity?).

<h3>COL SL8 Trip</h3>

<p>In iFIX in appeared COT SL8 has spontaneously turned itself off.  After paging the COT expert (Kevin Burkett), he adivsed to look at the text display behind the main COT HV window.  That told us SL8 really did trip.</p>

<p>For now, the advice is to run as we are.  If there is another trip, we will follow the trip-recovery instructions and page COT.</p>

Both COT trips were SL8 P12, which is the wire that has caused trouble in recent weeks.  It has been stable for more than an hour now, so we will not lower the voltage on this wire further.

CES Strip and CES Wire YMon plots.  In both bottom right plots, wedge 0 has some hot-to-warm portions.  These don't show up in the occupancy plots on the top right.  So I think it's okay, nothing obvious in the YMon100 plots.  I will email the plots to Shower max people just in case.

There was heartbeat alarm for CLC, CPR. I tried to restart the monitoring program. But it didn't work and made trigger inhibit set. So I reboot the CLS1 HV PC by the instruction. At this time, the PC was stuck. I went down 1st flour and reset the PC in the 1RR06D. And I restart the ifix and clc monitoring program and turn on the CPR HV with CLC expert Mary Convery.

<!-- Comment: Sun Apr 27 07;14;22 comment by...convery -->
This starts out as the same problem as always.  I'm not sure why twice this week there has been trouble restarting the monitoring -- if it is some real new problem or not.  I am reluctant to change the instructions without seeing it myself.  But probably rebooting the pc in this case was unnecessary; at least the other day, JJ was able to recover after restarting both server and client but no reboot.

TORTURE and COSMICS.  
 
17:00 Shot setup in progress 
17:20 All protons loaded 
17:74 All pbars loaded 
 
18:23 Store 6090 colliding and CDF is collecting data 
 
18:40 COT SL8 tripped. Recovered by going to STNADBY and back to 
ON. After paging COT expert (Kevin Burkett) he advised us to page COT 
is there is a second COT trip. 
 
19:05 COT SL8 tripped again.  COT export (Kevin Burkett) was paged 
again and drove in.  The trip came from the same wire which has been 
causing recent trouble. However as COT has been running stabley, no 
changes were made. 
 
 
20:10  SVX trips.  Couldn't immediately recover, so  Run 261416 was 
terminated.  New non-silicon run (Run Number: 261417) was started. 
 
Unfortunately the trip appears to be due to a bad power supply.  So an 
entire wedge was excluded.  But there is a mysterious trip message 
which is still getting reported.  So that means no silicon running. 
 
 
22:00 Congressman Bill Foster came over for a visit to CDF. 
 
22:40 CLC/CPR heartbeat was missing.  We followed the instructions to 
recover the montioring but this did not work.  We paged Mary Convery. 
 
 
There has been ongoing problem with ICICLE heartbeat problem as 
reported by iFIX. But procmon says it's Ok and ICICLE is running OK.
