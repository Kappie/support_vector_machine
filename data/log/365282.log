b0cmp00 keeps getting done TOs during muon calibration.  We've tried resetting the crate; aborting the run, resetting and starting over; but neither action has fixed b0cmp00.

<br>We had replaced several CAFE cards for 3E CEM, which accounts for the change in pedestal.  I updated the reference files after the earlier work, but forgot to do it after this case.<p>
If you check this calibration now, the black channels will no longer be there.  (The reference value will be different.)  The <b>green</b> channels will be the same, because they only update when the expert (Mario S.) changes them.

Tev elog: 16:04:01-   The CDF lowbeta quad supports have had four wedges installed in an attempt to reduce the vibrations. The tiltmeters show very minimal disturbance to the quads; less than what is seen during a normal ramp-off temperature excursion. Looking at the geophone on the Q3, we do not see any reduction in the baseline vibration level, and a quick test with a van shows that we are still sensitive to road traffic. M. McGee will supply specific details of the wedge installation. - TJ, DP<br> 
-- Thu Jun 17 16:05:55 comment by...TJ --  The only change we observe is a slight increase in the resonant frequency of the system from 12 to 12.6 Hz.  <br>

"15:32:05-   I modified the scraping order for the next proton only store and store. I changed the order of E03h and F48h and insert the A48H but fully retract it in TEVCOL 5. Pictures of the sequence follow. - DAS"<br><br>
Recall that A48H was not used at all until a few stores. When it
is "in", CDF observes "fake missing et events" in the detector.
<br><br>
It is not clear if this entry applies just to proton only store
or is "permanent". We should check movement of A48H after next
colliding store goes in.

Note also that Rob Roser believes surveyors found positions of
CDF low beta quads were changed by "anti-vibration shims"
noted above. We should check beam position soon after next
store goes in and note results in eLog.

CMX access summary: 
<p> 
We looked at the SW CMX miniskirt and couldn't get it to trip on the wedge itself.  We think the problem might be cable related but we couldn't get our detector to trip to search for the problem.  Se also looked at an ASD card in the SE arch but concluded that it was working fine and the problem was before it.  We will have to search for this another day as well.

On a good note, George and Roberto were able to recovered the over-saturated CMX HV anode current monitor channel (for CMX west 13-14 - aka C:MUHVC1) by replacing the bad chip.

<pre>Summary of TDC rate tests: 
 
We performed a series of readout rate  
measurements with both the current and 
development versions of the TDC DSP code. 
 
We took two runs to disk in the look area 
for further study offline.  The two runs  
are as follows: 
 
Run #184169 : 70500 events 
              DSP code = v61 
              SL1-4 ON, SL5-8 OFF 
              TDC pulsing frequency swept 
              between 2MHz and 14MHz. 
 
Run #184170 : 52155 events 
              DSP code = v61 
              SL1-8 ON 
              TDC pulsing frequency swept 
              between 2MHz and 14 MHz 
 
v45 DSP code was returned to all TDCs and  
the system was checked out by Dave Ambrose.  </pre>

<font color=red>Shift Summary: </font><pre>16:00   searched, secure, silicon bias scan finishing 
 
        Note: low bet quads have moved, tuning and perhaps aperture scans, 
        if aperature scan then si off 
 
18:20   JDL finishes fraction study, Anyes restores firmware, Eric James 
        finishes COT work 
 
        Cosmics, COT calib, Bill B takes EVB 
 
21:06   Trigger Table Test (featuring JDL's Sparky the hot pmt!) 
 
21:24   SVT studies, cosmic rays 
 
22:00   make that L2 torture, beam in TeV and now (cough) HV off 
 
23:04   SVT crates liberated - "ready" 
 
 
Good luck!!</pre>
