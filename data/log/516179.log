<!-- Comment: Fri Jun 18 05;24;17 comment by...rainer -->
could you please put in some summary ACNET shift plots for the beam studies during your shift ? please also check the BLM FIFOs whether any abort during the proton only studies has been messy.  The BLM part is described in <a href='http://www-cdfonline.fnal.gov/internal/ops/svxii/runii/quench.html'> these </a> instructions (you don't need to perform the full checkout, only see whether the BLMs latched in the last 12 hours). thanks.
<p>
ps.: your EVB does not sound healthy. I would be surprised if you had a smooth startup with these recurring SCPU errors I see in the elog.

Actually the problem was in subfarm 16<p>
If one converter node is down clean up L3 when a L3 expert is not around is worse because it will try to go there, and (of course) it will fail. Aces should try to run without that subfarm, and page L3 right away.
