flammable gas sub-detectors to OFF: COT,CMU,CMP,CMX,BMU
<!-- Author: Lucio -->


<!-- Date: Sun Jan 12 09:06:11 2003 -->
Starting to purge gas chambers with nitrogen.   Lucio has turned appropriate HV to off.  Chambers that get purge flow of nitrogen include COT, CMU, IMU, West CMX,  CMP modulo notch and blue beam chambers.   All flam gas alarms bypassed for the moment.

As of 10am, all systems requiring a fast n2 purge 
is under n2 purge flow.

<pre>Our Plan 
 
- TeV Studies end at noon -- take a full set of calibrations at 
 that point 
 
- Then power down solenoid 
 
- System belongs to plug sourcing guys -- they should go all  
night in order to get this task completed. 
 
- Silicon will come in around 7pm (after football games) to do 
 some tests as well.   These are compatible with plug sourcing 
 
-  System experts will start arriving at 6am to shut pieces down 
 in preparation for 7am power outage 
 
- Collision hall available for access 8am monday morning</pre>

This red telephone reminds me of a joke that I first heard from Carlo Rubbia.  Brezhnev is visiting Carter in the White House.  Carter shows him the latest triumph of American technology, the "Telephone to Hell".  It is brought out on a silver tray, Carter & Brezhnev pick it up and have a nice 5-minute conversation with the Devil.  Impressed, Brezhnev asks how much it costs.  Carter tells him it is very expensive, billions to develop and more than $10 million for the 5 minute call.  Brezhnev departs, and 6 months later when Carter is visiting the Kremlin, a silver tray appears with the Soviet Telephone to Hell.  They pick up up the phone and have a nice 5 minute conversation with the Devil. Impressed, Carter asks how much it costs.  Brezhnev replies that the 5 minute call cost 10 Rubles.  Incredulous, Carter asks how it can possibly be so inexpensive.  Brezhnev replies: "For us, is local call."

The PCAL ADMEMs have been recalibrated and downloaded with LER=1.
During the plug source runs, we found that the west PEM wedge 4
eta 17 tile 0 tower is hot (xa468 counts). The b0pcal08 slot
14 and 15 ADMEMs (PEM and PHA east wedge 7) did not have LER=1;
this was correctd at run 156525 and these wedges will be
redone.

The hot west PEM wedge 4 eta 17 tile 0's ADMEM was recalibrated
and downloaded with LER=1, as were the b0pcal08 slot 14 and 15
ADMEMs. These fixes have been verified with the plug laser run,
156527.

10:00 R. Roser puts all systems requiring a fast N2 purge under N2 purge flow. 
      HV down. 
12:00 First Pbars transferred from Recycler to Tevatron!  
      Foster is happy. 
12:30-13:30 Approximately complete set of calibrations taken. 
      (Calibrations were not checked by CO, who had been sent home.) 
13:50-14:30 Solenoid brought down for plug source runs. 
14:30  Plug source runs (ongoing). 
 
 
 
 
1) Evening and OWL CO's are released from duty.  
2) Only a single (experienced) Ace will be needed on evening and  
   Owl shift.  Aces can decide between themselves which one shows up.</pre>
