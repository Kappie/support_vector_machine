iFIX called and Irina is talking with him.

<!-- Comment: Sun Dec 14 09;00;00 comment by...Irina -->
<pre>Restarted IFix on vnode1. Problem's returned back- HBM alarm is present and all hearbeat boxes are grey.
 JC's suggested to 
1. Restart iFix on vnode2
2. Restart iFix on vnode1
If it doesn't help -3.reboot vnode1
Hope, it will help</pre>

<!-- Comment: Sun Dec 14 09;34;01 comment by...Irina -->
<pre>Hmmm...
I've restarted iFix on vnode2 and vnode2.
I did it 20!!!minutes ago on vnode2 and aroun 15 minutes on vnode 1, but we still don't have HV bars on HV Summary Pages and almost all buttons are grey on Global Alarms (exept of SVX,ISL,L00,GAM,ICI,INH,VOI- they are green (but their hearbeats are grey), some "D" buttons are green, HBM is red). Why is it taking so much time?!?! I'll wait 10 minutes and then ,if situation doesn't change, reboot vnode1.</pre>
<!-- Comment: Sun Dec 14 10;01;24 comment by...Irina -->
<pre> I've rebooted vnode1 7 minutes ago.
No HV bars yet, almost all is grey on Global Alarms but  (I really don't like it!!!) - HBM is red. Seems we still have the problem.</pre>
<!-- Comment: Sun Dec 14 10;49;57 comment by...Irina -->
<pre>After recovery HV bars've returned back and everything is green on Global Alarm, just HBM is red and hearbeats are grey.
(we have returned back to the morning state).
  JC will stop by the control room this afternoon. </pre>

At some point, the calorimeter ADMEMs (in ccal, pcal, and wcal) will need a new set of FRAM calibrations.  I have talked with Rick and Jeff, who would like to continue taking data for COT.  I will call back at 11 to guide the ACE through the (expert) procedure.<p> 
Besides getting the calorimeter ready after whatever work went on the last two weeks, recently the dead PHA 05W channel was restored.  (This channel had zero pedestals.  Howard and Willis diagnosed a faulty connector, and Mike L. fixed it.)  This channel has an unknown set of calibrations, which should be remedied.

I noticed that the /data1 disk is agin 96% full. 
 I asked the Ace to close/restart EH GUi so I could remove a big errlog log file. 
 After deleting this file,the disk is still 96% full. So something else is building up...

<!-- Comment: Sun Dec 14 12;59;42 comment by...m mattson -->
<br>The multiple FRAM erasures are not a problem.  On the other hand, pcal00 slot 17 ch 15 does look bad.  Last time, the "wrong vals in FRAM" was for range 3, so I thought it was a glitch that might be fixed by a second calibration.  This time, it complains about range 18.  The problem is that there are only 8 ranges (from 0-7).  There is always a chance that this is a monitoring problem, but I suspect the worse.<p>
I will make a repair submission to the ops manager, and call into the control room to see what they think.  This would require opening the west plug steel, to replace the CAFE card.<p>
This channel is PHA, phi 0W, eta 17.  The CO should check any YMon plots during future cosmic runs, to see what strange behavior comes out of this channel.
<!-- Date: Sun Dec 14 12:51:38.559 2003 -->
<pre>There seems to be a problem in loading the "calorimeter constants".  We are getting errors.  I will wait for a short time to see if Mark Mattson calles back... he was also going to check the log files.  </pre>
<!-- Author: Rick -->
<!-- Comment: Sun Dec 14 13;14;14 comment by...m mattson -->
The DAQ Ace can use pcal00 again.  I've finished doing diagnostics.
<!-- Comment: Sun Dec 14 13;23;07 comment by...m mattson -->
<br>The CAFE in pcal00 slot 17 ch 15 is clearly losing its mind.  When running qietest, I did a map of the crate (checking the id numbers of the ADMEMs and CAFE cards).  That channel reported 65534, which is a nonsense number (should be 4 digits only).<p>
On the other hand, pedestals (in both pass-through and FRAM-lookup) are normal, as was the QIE calibration (slopes).  I looked at parts of the FRAM table, which appear okay.  There is a chance that this channel will behave normal enough (during datataking) that it will not disrupt the DAQ.<p>
I am submitting a repair request, and have alerted the shift crew that if the channel acts up, it may be necessary to have the L1 trigger pager mask the channel.  I'm just not certain when or if the CAFE will flake out completely.

<br>You can put pcal00 back in the run, when ready.  If there are any trigger problems from this channel, it would show up in HAD phi 0, eta 3 (trigger coordinates).

<!-- Comment: Sun Dec 14 13;22;17 comment by...Jeff -->
Also, I have switched Level3's l3proxy process to the one that runs on b0l3pcom1 so that we can try to understand its (occassional) failure modes.  The state/transition area of the L3 Display is always red when we test this, because the monitoring does not yet function there.

There were problems with TOF channel 308 last night ( trips ). 
I told an ACE to turn the channel off. 
 
I just came in and turned that channel back on, ACEs should 
keep an eye on it and if it trips again, go downstairs and click 'reset trip and leave off' button for that channel in SMACs. 
Then please make an entry in TOF e-log.
