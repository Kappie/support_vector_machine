ISL yellow in global alarms. Cooling circuit east #3 supply flow is at lower limit. Waiting a few minutes to see if it cleared, if it does not, we will find silicon people.

Green again.

<!-- Comment: Thu Apr 10 08;59;07 comment by...Tom -->
I rebalanace the flows in ISL since we now have good vacuum from the replacement pump, and the flow control valves can be put at their nominal positions.  ISL CCE3 dipped below the warning level, and I increased it a bit.  Will keep an eye on CCW3 temperatures this shift.

I am going to relocate the amplifier for the DAQ Sound Server. 
Audible warnings will be off for a few minutes.

<!-- Comment: Thu Apr 10 09;29;45 comment by...jj -->
The amplifier for the sound server has been moved from on top
of rack 2RR12B to shelf in upper section of 2RR13B.  DAQ Sound Server is back on and working.

While trying to partition a new run, evb2b went red. Check EVB proxy showed partition 0 was not running. Check scpu showed a synchronization error. We cleaned up EVB, but the Eventbuilder is red in DAQmon, and the run still won't partition.

Dee has called MCR about access scheduling.  It looks like it has been delayed yet again.  We are rescheduling most access activities until tomorrow.  It is possible for Dee to help out with a controlled access this evening for anyone who is bent on doing work at that time (possibly silicon).  Supervised access may start very early tomorrow morning (6:00 - 6:30 AM?) 
<p> 
MCR will call here when they are ready.

<!-- Author: Fotis :: (run <a href='/java/cdfdb/servlet/RunSummary?RUN_NUMBER=260550' target=_top>260550</a>) -->
<!-- Comment: Thu Apr 10 15;08;56 comment by...m mattson (ADMEM) -->
<br>
Yeah, that is the failure message that really isn't a failure.  The RMS of the pedestal distribution is about 2.8 units (val 1.2748) instead of the usual 1.5 units, but it will still load the calibration.  You can get "failures" of 10 or 20 units, and still get a decent set of calibrations for the channel.
<p>
The failures to watch out for are zero peds, zero RMS, or zero calib slopes.
<!-- Comment: Thu Apr 10 15;14;12 comment by...Elisa  -->
Thanks, Mark. I will go ahead at do Calib_Load when I get the wcal crates back.

<font color=red>Shift Summary: </font><pre>No beam, no access.  Waiting for quench recovery, septum replacement, and pelletron repair.  MCR just called at the end of our shift to tell us we can start our access, and Steve and Alon went down to do the radiation survey so we can open up for supervised access on evening shift.</pre>

<P> 
A new check box has been added to the "Expert" Run Settings  
options called "UseLinearOne".    This causes LER=1 values  
to be sent to the front end crates, and is used by Fotis  
to download prior to source running.    Fotis needs to  
remember to download the proper current values after the  
source runs and before leaving the B0 building.  If he does  
not, angry pop-up windows will ensue. 
<P> 
This is <I>rundb</I> package <i>v2_4d</I> version.
