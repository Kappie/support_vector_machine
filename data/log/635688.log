<pre>36*36 store in progress with L ~ 1.5 E29. Taking data with run 
103549 using trigger table Commissioning_2E29 (L3 exe 67). 
The chamber HV's are on. The COT is at a higher-than normal HV 
which gives a gain 40% higher than normal. Aseet Mukherjee 
expresses satisfaction with how smoothly the chamber is behaving 
at this higher gain (so far).</pre>

<pre>Willis Sakumoto notices that the clock is in an error state 
(sync missing, sync timing, rf missing). We halt the run 
(run 103549 at event 174782), reset the clock and resume data 
taking with the same run.</pre>

<pre>Currently taking data at about 70 Hz. The current trigger table 
includes XFT triggers (with thresholds 2, 4, 8 and 12 GeV/c) 
pointing at wedges 4 and 5. It is believed that these triggers 
are correct at the FRED input. FRED is not doing the prescaling 
correctly, however, and only half (four) of these triggers get 
through FRED with nonzero rate.</pre>

<!-- Comment: Sun Nov  5 01;26;32 comment by...Ted Liu -->
XFT folks will certainly need these runs offline for XFT performance study. so it's important to inform them about the missing bits.

Greg already made a note of this at last shift E-log. 

**** 23:10  FRED is having problems reliably providing the new tracking triggers after the prescaling/masking circiuts. Each time we
reprogram the Xilinx chip a different set of bits get lost, so it seems the problem may be in Xilinx resource assignment. We will try to make more bits
come through tomorrow.  - Greg F *********

I will post a few screen shots to show which bits are on/off later.

<pre>CMP and CMX HV tripped off at 0100 hrs. They have been reset, 
and except for hardware over/under voltage condition (one chamber 
of the CMP bottom and CMX east wedge 15 inner), they are now  
back at voltage. I could not tell if this trip was beam related 
as the ACNET lumberjack plot with the beam losses was blank. 
However, after bring the loss plotter back up, I did notice 
occaisonal spikes in the p and pbar loss rates.</pre>

hmm, it's hard to imagine that the bits are swaped at hardware and (at least) most software level. because we can clearly
see the bunch counter increase in the right order as
the buffer number. I looked at the L2 buffer bits on the
CDF-style backplane before, see next entry. anyway, still
don't understand the L2 buffer occupancy though ...
<!-- Comment: Sun Nov  5 07;52;26 comment by...patrick -->
This is a known feature of unknown origin.
<!-- Comment: Mon Nov  6 08;06;28 comment by...Michael Schmidt -->
<pre><pre>
The most sensible explanation is that the decoding of
the L2 buffer bits from the J2 backplane has got buffer
1 and 2 swapped on the TSI transition card that drives
these scalers.  In fact we had already discovered that the hardware implementation was such that we expected (and as I recall verified) that the expected order (0,1,2,3)
into the scalers was reversed (3,2,1,0) as is reflected
in the bank description.  I will go back and double check
all of this once again.
</pre></pre>
<!-- Comment: Mon Nov  6 16;32;48 comment by...Michael Schmidt -->
<pre><pre>
We have gone back to the TSI transition card schematics
and sure enough the bits are swapped coming onto this board
from the TS crate J2 backplane.  Note this is after the
TS has sent the L1A message to the TRACER, so Myron mode
works as expected.  The ONLY thing that is affected is the
L2 buffer usage reported by the scalers which are driven
by the TSI transition card: L2 buffer 1 and 2 are swapped.

We could suggest changing the online/offline software to
reflect this swap but I would suggest against it since the
TSI transition board is a prototype and will be replaced
with this feature corrected.

<!-- Comment: Mon Nov  6 18;11;35 comment by...Ted Liu -->
glad to know that it was just a bits swap local to the scalers.
nothing to worry about then.

<!-- Comment: Sun Nov  5 04;38;46 comment by...Ted Liu -->
found my logbook and checked that the L2 buffer(0) bit on
the scope picture is indeed CDF_L2B0* (J2/P2 pin A14) where
I connected the scope probe to, and L2 buffer(1) is pin A15 CDF_L2B1*.

run 103551 notes: 
-problems in starting with b0svt00: it didn't respond in  
partition; I rebooted and it was fine afterwards. 
-b0tsi00 gave problems, evb was very slow; I cleaned up  
EVB and L3; 
-at the first trip in the COT I did H+R+R (not HRR)and  
immediately after I got a DoneTimeOut from both 
 b0cmp00 and b0svx02; it recovered anyway after trying  
once more; 
-immediately before getting a BusyTimeOut in the b0tsi02 
 I noticed this  error in the green screen of death:

which I had never seen before; it didn't affect in any  
way the run, but the green screen didn't scroll anymore  
until the next H+R+R. 
-for the other trips in the cot, I always used H+R+R, so  
far so good. 
-again many data truncations in all crates except 4,15,16; 
17 particularly bad. 
 
I kept out HADRON_TIMING_00, LEVEL2_GLOBAL_00 (when I  
tried to include them they failed in partition); 
TS_CRATE_00 was already out (am I supposed to have it in??)

<pre>CMP and CMX HV trips: beam related, as there has been a series 
of rather large beam loss spikes. CMP:  upper SW region; 
CMX: west 13-14 inner and outer. As soon as I reset them, the 
CMP and CMX trip again, and these trips are again beam related. 
 
We de not to bring the CMP and CMX back up, but to leave them 
at standby because of the increased intensity and rate of 
beam losses.</pre>

<!-- Comment: Sun Nov  5 17;37;34 comment by...Arnd -->
This is almost certainly due to not-yet-fully-implemented
features of the scalers. That's why also all the by-bunch
rates are shown as zero.

<!-- Comment: Mon Nov  6 07;56;01 comment by...Michael Schmidt -->
<pre><pre>
Ted, Arnd is correct, this feature and a few others were
not yet implemented, as noted in a previous entry in this
space, because they require some firmware adjustments to
the card driving these scalers to adjust for the relative
timing between signals from FRED, TS and the TRACER.  
It would be VERY useful if the system is left in tact so
that these timing adjustments can be made and tested (the
fake clock will do).

while CLC and TOF folks doing a speical run, i.e. CLC is taken 
out of the partition, we will take a run with track trigger 
input from wegde 2 and 3 (was wedge 4 and 5). the idea is 
to take a run for these two wedges so that XFT people will 
have some data to look at for wedge 2 and 3. also will check 
trigger bits on scope. I have just swaped the cable  
(from wedge 4 and 5 to wedge 2 and 3), and will 
put everything back after this run (back to wedge 4 and 5). 
 
the trigger table for this run will be COMMISSIONING_2E29. 
run number will be avaiable once the run starts.

<!-- Date: Sun Nov 5 07:49:18 2000 -->
<pre>Shift summary: 
 
1. Took data with Commissioning_2E29 which includes XFT triggers 
   in the direction of wedges 4 and 5. COT operating with 40% 
   higher gain than before. FRED prescaling not working 
   correctly for all these XFT triggers. See notes by Ted Liu 
   in logbook about this.  
   Runs 103549 and 103551 (with COT SL7 HV off after 
   approximately event 258059). Total of one million events  
2. There is a note in the logbook about initial alignment of 
   barrel 4 with respect to the COT. 
3. There are notes in the logbook about pt dependence of XFT 
   trigger rates and about a puzzle concerning the frequence 
   of Level 2 buffer use (the order is 0, 2, 1, 3) by Ted Liu. 
4. Had three trips of COT SL7 and several CMP, CMX HV trips. 
   We also see loss peaks from the Tevatron beams though not as 
   regular in time as two days ago. 
5. We look at the monitors for differences in COT plots between 
   now (higher COT gain) and before (normal gain) but see little 
   difference.  
6. Took data with TEST_CMU, 200 K events total, runs 103552, 
   103553 (both including SVT00) and 103554 (without SVT00). 
7. Began preparations for TOF special run (Ivan+Alexei) 
8. Suggest day shift call COT expert on duty about SL7 HV trips</pre>
