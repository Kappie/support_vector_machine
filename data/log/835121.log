PSM alarm.  Lindgren pokes around and can't figure it out.  We page expert.
<!-- Author: Liss -->
<!-- Comment: Tue Nov 11 16;43;04 comment by...Liss -->
No response from PSM pager.  Mike checked PC and thinks there is a PS off in the collision hall.  Paged calorimeter electronics expert to tell them that they will have to go in in the AM.
<!-- Comment: Tue Nov 11 17;04;35 comment by...m mattson -->
Some details would be nice:
<ul>
<li>which power supplies
<li>is there any work going on in the hall, or did these PS just spontaneously go bad
<li>is this monitoring or a real problem?  Suggest taking a cal QIE calibration.  (The one taken earlier today showed no abnormal problems.  If a PS is off, should see the problem pretty clearly)
</ul>

ccal00 is the crate.
<!-- Comment: Tue Nov 11 22;07;44 comment by...Steve Hahn -->
<p>For the life of me, I can't get a screen copy of voltman plots, so I'll just summarize here:</p>

<p>This the crate CANWT_2 or b0ccal00.  Plots from voltman (which Mike and
I could only look at after I rebooted VOLTMAN, it seemed to be in some funny
state where it was not hung but would not report on individual power supplies
or do plot) clearly show the +15 V supply failing at about 1330 today.  The
embarrassing part is I didn't notice until after the search and secure.  To the
best of my knowledge, no one was working in this area (and I have asked 
several accessors).</p>

<p>I will notify Roberto to take a look at this first thing tomorrow.  It may be
as simple as simply clearing a fault on the crate or as complicated as a swap
and investigation, but I'd like him to have the first oppurtunity to take a look
at it.</p>

Dear Ace, 
 would you please restart the  merlin server process on b0dap62 (instructions are in the Procmon web page). 
Last night errlog died apparently trying to un-pack a 'bad' merlin message. No merlin DBs or log files are currently written. So it is difficult to track down what happened. 
Thank you.

L3 and EVB status:<br> 
We think we have fixed the problem between EVB and converters, which avoid to take data at all. The root of the problem came from ATM driver. There was a kind of quota core limit of ~65Kb in the socket object (we receive data inside it), when our standard data size is bigger than that quantity. This was the reason because system was working with very few crates. We don't need quota for anything (it doesn't make any sense in this case), so we have increased that quota limit, and everything is working well.<br> 
We have made several L2 torture runs, and I'm making a test run including as many crates as possible with the current Physics trigger table (no silicon). No problems in the L3 (but deadtime is huge coming from L2).<br> 
We will make a few more tests tomorrow to be sure that everything is ok.<br>

<pre>I performed a hot extraction/insertion of all  
the TDC boards in b0cmx01.  The hope is that  
this will clear up the excess CMX east trigger  
primitives observed in TrigMon during cosmic  
running.  Please check the muon trigger slides  
in TrigMon during the next cosmic run. </pre>

Greg was probably too demure to say so, but to note, according to the <a href="http://www-cdfonline.fnal.gov/daq/runSummary/errorlog/errorfile173908.log">error  log</a> the real problem was that b0cot00 pulled error which 
generates the (misleading) message "TS failed when trying to Run (State 2)".  This is in fact not a  TS problem, and the Aces should learn to recognize it (it would help if the message indicated where the real problem is)

It appears that L1 track triggers were running at the BC rate of 1.7Mhz using the physics table earlier today.  Since the problem shows up in both the L1_TRK4 and L1_CMU0_PT4 triggers (before prescale), it is either an XFT or XTRP problem and not a problem with the two-track board.

<font color=red>Shift Summary: </font><pre>L3/EVB work at star of shift.  They have found and fixed the problem, which  
turned out to be quota set for socket objects (that is, data) passing through 
the ATM .  This was fixed and tested (at some level), but they returned us to 
old system becuase none of us thought the full suite of trigger tables were  
ready for the new system. 
 
A PSM alarm was eventually traced to a +15V PS on b0ccal00 that failed earlier 
this aft but was undetected due to a VOLTMAN failure.  PS on the list for 
fixing in the AM. 
 
While waiting for Si expert to arrive for guinea pig torture we tried to start 
cosmics.  Ran into TSI problems eventually traced to six COT crates that 
were ill behaved.  cot00,01,02,07,08,16 .  We speculate that this is somehow 
related to COT crate CPU swap done on day shift. 
 
Started guinea pig torture at 22:06 
 
JDL called (and put note in log) that L1 track triggers were running at BC rate 
during L3 test run.  This appears (to him) to be due to an XFT or XTRP problem. 
It needs to be looked at in the AM because we can't run cosmics in this state.</pre>
