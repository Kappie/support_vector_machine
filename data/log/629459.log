COT front-end checks out after Eric James swapped TDC's in 
crate 7.  Temporary problem with crate 6 (no calib signals to 
crate).  Eric swapped twin-ax 1->3 fan-out output to crate 6 
to spare channel, fixed.

<pre>Jianrong and I replaced the TDC boards on slots 11-21  
of b0cot07 with boards modified for fast clear.  Also,  
I replaced the TDC board in slot21 of b0clc00 because  
of errors observed earlier today originating from this  
slot.  Please pay carefull attention to clc monitoring  
plots at the start of the next store to make sure that  
everything looks ok.</pre>

<b>DQMon alarm</b> complaining about <b>CMP</b> Bottom.<br>
In IFIX, all the detector appears with the HV on, but the CO histogram shows a clear stack with no signal.<br>
Went downstairs and saw that the power supply connected to bottom A2 showed no current in the amperimeter, even though it was ON.<br>

<pre>I decided it was not useful to call the CMP experts because
the problem cannot be solved as discussed in yesterdays meeting.</pre>
<!-- Comment: Wed Apr 13 07;21;46 comment by...Dale -->
It appears that the anode (A2) tripped off [switch was on - but HV off due to trip] sometime between when Xiaojian (see his <a href=
'/cgi/elog/elog.pl?nb=2005&action=view&page=305&frame=2&anchor=12:32:29.531'>
summary</a>) last looked at it and this morning.  (Note "D2" was on and holding).
<!-- Comment: Wed Apr 13 09;17;22 comment by...Xiaojian -->
Now CMP bottom A2 has recovered, let me summarize it from the OWL shift of April 12 to the OWL shift of April 13:

1) It started trip at around 3:30am in April 12. As it did 4 times before during this year, a number of tries of ramping it up has failed. So it was turned off, and the run should be marked as CMP bad. 

2) Phil, Dale and Xiaojian did a number of detail test to diagnose the problem. The problem that we found is: The A2 section is very sensitive to the ramping process. The trip happens at a HV around 3000-3600. We could not estimate the magnitude of the tripping current, since the drawing current was always stable and normal until it suddenly tripped, neither the monitor display nor the amperemeter of the portable HV source can capture the tripping current. We used the portable HV source to power the section to the full HV, ignoring the trips during the ramping. It holds the HV without problem. 

3) Dale checked the section at 7:21am on April 13, finding it has tripped. Probably due to the shot setup process around 4am. So, the section has been on full HV for near 20 hours with the portable HV supply. From the experience of the section, leaving the section on full HV for a number of hours seems to be the only way for the section to recover. 

4) Dale connected the section to the CAEN, and ramped it up to full HV around 7:30am. 

  I should point out that fixing the problem will be very difficult due to the following two reasons:

i) Given the location, we need long access, I estimate 5 hours at least. 

ii) The problem section is not fully broken. It works most of the time, except acts up for a number of hours (5 - 20 hours), then recovers itself. Therefore, one needs the long access happens at the time when the section is broken. 

  The section is running well now. From the history, I estimate it may trip badly again after 7 -10 days.

I've reenabled inhibits for CMP - If bottom section 2 trips - turn it off and continue running.  Expert/SPL will likely ask for a new run if CMP continues to hold.  I'm going back to my office.
