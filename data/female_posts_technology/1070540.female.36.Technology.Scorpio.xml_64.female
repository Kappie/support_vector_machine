But it really irks me that my husband tells me he cant feel our click anymore, but instead of spending time with me trying to get it back he talks to women on line.  Maybe I am wrong, but if you are trying to click with someone else. You wont get the other click back and I will be damed if we do not get ours back.  He is worth too much to me to let some horny bitch take him even if its just mentally.  He is mine and I love him and I wont let anybody mess with it. But neither should he.
