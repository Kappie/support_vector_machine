For example, on monrning on my way to work, I noticed a gentleman in a  urlLink red convertible  moving around his car as if struggling to get comfortable.  It turns out, he was reaching down to put on his socks.  Luckily this was at a rather llloooonnnnngggg stoplight on the northside, so he had plenty of time to finish his task.  This morning, at my favorite bagel shop,  urlLink Einstein Bros  I noticed that the driver in the parking spot next to me was painting her fingernails.  Luckily the car was parked, so no harm-no foul.   Wonder what I'll spot next???
