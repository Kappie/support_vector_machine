I've been compared to a butterfly just flitting from here to there without really landing anywhere and I guess that's about accurate. Its not just the apartment or the job or anything really. I think its a mixture of too much at one time. I just can't concentrate. ADD child at her worst right now. Normally I could deal with that but with all the changes and because of all the stuff I'm not sleeping well, hence the 4 am post. Its make me hypersensitive and I feel like I am on the verge of tears most the time. I hate feeling unfocused and ungrounded. I'm hitting a meeting on my lunch hour today.   I have a bunch of guys coming over Saturday morning to help me move, or rather move me. Friday there is no work which is a mixed blessing. I could have used the money and no work means no pay. At the same time I have so much to do its kind of a good thing. Not sure exactly when this phone number gets turned off only that the new one will be active today I hope. All the utilities go into my name today and cable gets installed Saturday. I pick the keys up for the apartment on my way home tonight from work. Tomorrow is the Race for the Hungry and then I think I am just going to bring stuff to the apartment and veg there afterwards with Freedom. I was invited to dinner at a friend's place and I might run over to eat but I really kind of just want to relish in being *home*.
