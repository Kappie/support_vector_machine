Anyway it was cool had lots of fun.  Drank absolute and cranberry....Note to self.  Bad hangovers the next day. :-P  John's birthday was Sun. (bass player) Old man. LOL Anyway If all goes well which I can't see why it wouldn't, I am doing the show on the 22 of May.  Woo hoo. Anyway had to take my archives down for a while cause someone read them who probably should not have and I think I may have gotten someone in a little trouble.  Anyway, if people were fucking honest this would not be an issue right now, but I am going to put them up again just have to let things settle down a bit.  I should find out about that house today also.  Keep your fingers crossed.  I have to go I am at work, but I will try and blog more later.
