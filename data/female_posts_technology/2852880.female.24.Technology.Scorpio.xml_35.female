Things are supposed to actually get more difficult as you get older and have more and more responsibility, but the song gives some hope and inspiration.  I'm not going through a particularly hard time right now, but I believe everyone can always use a little extra motivation.  I have swapped CDs with my friend Walter.  We found out that we each had "depressing" mixes.  Basically it's that mix you listen to when you just want to bask in the sadness of the world.  I had one that was made by Chris Sharp.  I believe it was his first mix, and he made me a copy.  It wasn't intended to be depressing as far as I know, but it just sort of turned out that way.  I think it's a fabulous mix.  I've just finished listening to Walter's mix and that one was a big downer too. :-)  Night Swimming was on it, among many other songs.  Counting Crows are always good for depressing songs.  What are your downer songs?
