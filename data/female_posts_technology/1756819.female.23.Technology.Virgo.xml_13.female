Now we just have to wait for our IP address to be set so we can redirect it to our app.  In the meantime I'm back doing my usual development which is wonderful.  Now I can finally address the issues that the clinics are having!  Feels good.  *sigh*    Now as the clock ticks forward I don't cringe at every second that goes by.  Five o' clock here I come!  Today I will actually make it home at a regular time and be able to just go home and not worry about this project.  How wonderful.
