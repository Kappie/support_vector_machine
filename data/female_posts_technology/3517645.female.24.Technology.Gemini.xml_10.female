Even when the kids were babies they would wake up early, but as soon as they ate we all went back to sleep. Usually around noon my mind will start to function properly. Two days to go then I can rest have hopefully finish my kitchen. God knows Duane will not finish like he is suppose to today. He said he was going to do it yesterday, but it seems he never gets around to doing anything cause he said he would do the kitchen on Tuesday and mow the lawn on Wednesday, but we all know the lawn will definitely not get done today and I will end up doing it tomorrow night when I get off work.   The kids were good last night. I think they had a hard day like me yesterday at the babysitters. I must get Duane to talk to the school today regarding the bus though, they keep forgetting to drop her off at the babysitters when she is suppose to go there. Duane sends a note to the school so they should be able to keep things straight. That god it is almost done for the summer. We all went to bed quite early after we had a good laugh at the bad singers on Canadian Idol. Go I can't believe some of those people think they are actually good singers. I think some just do it to get on TV.   well until later.....
