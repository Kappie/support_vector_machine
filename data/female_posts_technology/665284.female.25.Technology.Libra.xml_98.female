It will be starring Dave Corpin, Abby Yao, Racquel Villlavicencio and Ronnie Lazaro.  We are really excited about this movie, coz it is the first time we have produced anything ourselves together.  And it is our first step in conquering Philippine and world cinema (BWAHAHAHA!) manic laughter!  But seriously, we have finally come to realize, that the only way to produce better cinema is to create it ourselves.  So this is our first swing at it, and hope you all come to watch us bat.  BULONG SA KAWALAN, what is it about?  Well can’t really tell you coz we don’t want to spoil it, but basically it is a psycho-thriller, and I got scared.  But of course, I’m easily scared.  But even me being so scared of horror movies had the guts to produce this one coz Bobi is da man.  Anyway, hope you all come!  BULONG SA KAWALAN will be shown on November 14, 21, 22 and 28.  All screenings will be at 8 pm at the Brash Young Cinema, located at the basement of the S Building, Esteban corner Dela Rosa Street, Legaspi Village, Makati.  We’ll have more screenings if we make money. ;)  Tickets will be at 60 pesos.  Charged at the gate.  Thanks! -------------------------------------------------  I watched yesterday, November 14 and I tell you come and watch the movie.  Really good!
