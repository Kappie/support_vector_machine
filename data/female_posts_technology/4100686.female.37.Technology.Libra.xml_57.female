It is becoming apparent that Iraq is much more then simply a matter of geographic, or ethnographic, or even religiographic boundaries. While on the one hand Iraq's physical borders are transgressed, on the other hand Iraq begins to surpass the physical realm. Is this the road to enlightenment? Do we need a map?)
