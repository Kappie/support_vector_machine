The words, each time,      graced my lips like an impostor, only to fall away like some great blizzard         that was taken out to sea to rain it's fury on the dark ocean, alone,            unbeknwowsnt to any hearing...                And whether that day is tomorrow, or next week, or next year, or next           lifetime...I will finally get to tell you to your sweet face. The face I        will miss more than I could ever tell, that...I love You. And you'll smile wryly, close your eyes, say 'catch me baby,'...and fall."    --Eric Schaeffer, from the movie "Fall"
