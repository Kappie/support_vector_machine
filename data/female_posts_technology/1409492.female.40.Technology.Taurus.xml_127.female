I decided to TiVo it at a later hour so I could skip through the boring stuff. One thing I did catch was an appearance and song by  The Beastie Boys . My first thought was, "geez, they look kinda old!". Has it been that long since they declared that we had to fight for our right to par-tay?   Well, I ran across this site today: urlLink Retro Crush . It has a link to the aforementioned song. Or at least part of it. Damn them, now I have that stupid  Madness  song stuck in my head.
