She felt like a rock sometimes that keeps sinking further into the ground.  "Catherine, can you please look at these quickly for me before I go into my meeting?" Tom asked as he walked by to go into his office.  She sighed again. That wasn't her job. She was a programming analyst and yet she felt like a secretary. She couldn't quit because the bills had to be paid and her family to support.  Her husband watched their daughter during the day while she worked and he also went to school to finish his degree. She only hoped it was all worth the trouble that they were going through to become financially secure.  She wanted another baby but she didn't know how to have one and go to work at the same time. She would love to stay home for the first few months to get know the new one but if she was working she can only stay home for six weeks.  She looked quickly over the papers for Tom. She noticed he got many of the technical terms wrong not only in spelling but also in context. She rewrote the paper quickly before he came out to ask about it.  Tom came out in a rush, grab the paper before she could even explain the changes to him. She sighed. She didn't care if he messed up. He should slow enough to know that she wasn't his damn secretary to begin with.
