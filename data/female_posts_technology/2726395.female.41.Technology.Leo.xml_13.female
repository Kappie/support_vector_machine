He has made his newfound hatred of me apparent, finding fault in everything I say, finding something to get offended about in the most innocuous of statements, purposely withholding any friendliness whatsoever and keeping his mail strictly school related.  I stopped sending him anything at all about what I am up to, because he never acknowledges it, and never says anything at all about himself, even if I ask such top secret, highly invasive questions like, "So when do you get back from Istanbul?"  It is clear, his transformation is complete. He hates me because Nancy hates me, and it is so much easier to let her think for him than to have his own opinion that might be different from hers. And Nancy hates me for no reason at all.  These aren't nice people. I guess I have come to this conclusion. I feel a little sick to my stomach at the realization, because I still have such warm and pleasant memories of a sweet and loving friend, of good conversations, quiet sunsets, and quiet devotion.  And it all evaporated, and only the memories remain.  Now there is this really ugly person left--judgmental, hateful, spiteful..and tonight I have to welcome him into my house, into my HOME, when all I want to do is forget he ever existed, to wipe those memories of two years of happiness.  The sad thing is, I don't hate him back. I don't like him very much right now, and probably will never like him again, but...I love the man. That just doesn't turn off. It would be so much easier if I could loathe and despise him. But I just don't.  Now if I could just figure a way to get him out of my life forever. But that would mean leaving the German School, and leaving a lot of people high and dry. Thomas would not think twice about doing it; in Nancy's Machiavellian thinking, it doesn't matter how much you hurt other people as long as you get what you want. And that's Thomas' philosophy now, too, apparently.  But it isn't mine. I haven't changed a bit. I still hold to my principles, no matter how painful. I don't hate. I don't quit. And I believe that everyone gets what they deserve.  And I know what Thomas will get.  That would bring other people a delicious pleasure, knowing that his retribution is a life with a shrew he himself didn't want, forcibly cut off from having any close friends, bowing to her every will.  But it brings me only deep sadness and no pleasure at all. Schadenfreude is not in my character, I guess.
