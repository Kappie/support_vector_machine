Sure, most of that money is going to rent, but since I have almost paid off my ortho bills, I think it's time to treat myself to a pair of shoes (square toe black oxfords, to be exact). And maybe some pants and a warm sweater. One of the few good things about being 'petite' is that I can shop at Brass Plum for the rest of my life, so that's we're I'm going today during lunch (in 2 long hours). I'm dragging Kelly too. We have a tradition of fish tacos followed by 15 minutes at Nordy's. It's absolutely freezing in the office today, as my nipples clearly indicate, and it's aggravating my cough. I take swigs of Robitussin but it doesn't seem to be doing any good. Co-drones are getting annoyed with my cough but what am I supposed to do?  Ooh. Costco folks are here to do a presentation and they've brought breakfast. Gotta go.
