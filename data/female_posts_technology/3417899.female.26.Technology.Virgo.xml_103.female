This one, though, I had to share. It's free, it's legal, it's unlimited and it's actually a great productivity tool.  It's a search and indexing add-on, fully integrated with Outlook, just recently released by Microsoft after their acquisition of the company that developed this tool.  If you have  urlLink Gmail , you know how great an add-on like this can be...  urlLink Enjoy !
