More specifically, being just sick enough on Friday that I can still go to work but be miserable the whole time, have a fever of 102.5 by Saturday morning, and have to lay in bed all weekend and eat ice cream.  Okay, so the latter two things weren't bad, but getting dizzy every time I stood up too fast left something to be desired.  I still don't know what was wrong with me (or my health), but the number one suspect right now is a sinus infection.  Ugh.  The weekend would have been extremely boring and miserable if I didn't have my Nurse Wayne there to take care of me.  Have I told you guys I'm lucky?  Just checking.  I'm feeling much better now.  Just in time to not miss any work.  How fortunate.
