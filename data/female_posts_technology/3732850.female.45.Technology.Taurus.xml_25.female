During the winter months, when everything else is dead and dormant, the pine tree remains green and healthy looking. They provide shelter for the forest creatures under their strong branches.Summer brings their time for growth and even though their needles are sharp to the touch, their new growth is so soft and smooth. Their new needles are a pale green and vulnerable at first, but soon they blend into the rest of the tree adding more strength and size.   Pine trees do not allow much growth underneath them. They don't need any other growth to sustain them. They stand strong and independently in the woods. Just like the pinecones they create. They remain strong and whole once they drop from the trees.  The smell. I love the smell of pine trees. There is nothing better than the smell of fresh cut pine. It is a strong smell but a comforting smell.
