I’d come home rather late from a delightful evening of laying in the street and, because it was so late, decided to just park in the driveway. I figured I wasn’t going to be there that long, just to sleep, and I was tired. Plus, the last people that borrowed the truck parked it retarded when they returned it and I could barely get past it into the garage. I know they don’t read this but still, park better. Ok, so, the karma part. Just hours earlier I was scheming about how to steal the Angel billboard in Tucker. I figured the shows cancelled, the billboard is one of those single, giant sheets they just tie down  and  it would look fantasticleese on the roof of the house. It’s wicked cool too. Angel looks all dangerous and airbrushed. But come on, it was just big talk. I no longer have any minions (and this job would require several), at least none that would help in an 8th grade criminal activity. Also, I’m too old for that kind of shit. And if I know I’m too old, I’m too old. (Sometimes I still have lapses of judgment as to what constitutes “a good idea at the time”) I had no idea just  thinking  evil thoughts would get me punished. I mean, I have thoughts all the time about the deliciously perverted things I’d like to do to a select few of you. (You know who you are. And by that I mean you haven’t got a clue,  thank god , because if you did there’d be restraining orders and shunning and the rest of you would mock me for being such a bent up perv.) Yes, if the mere thinking of the evil gets me into trouble then I am  so  screwed without a kiss. So, they took my bolleramas. These are the best sunglasses on the planet. And the only pair of sunglasses I owned that cost more than a dollar. They were functional (kept the sun out of my eyes, even with the top down, so I wouldn’t have to wear a hat thus messing up my hair. Ha-Ha!) And they were retro cool. Ray Ban has been making them since the 50s and I liked to imagine that when I wore them I was super fine, hip 50s spy chick. Of course the reality was I looked like a tard but it’s good to have dreams. I’ve had those damn things for at least 15 years and they were $80.00 when I got them. On sale! They probably don’t even make them anymore, bastards. They also took my book of CDs. Who would give you crack money for CDs without the cases? This is what was in the book. Rod Stewart-Blondes have more fun The Backstreet boys Jet-get born The Osmonds-21 hits With the Beatles Buffy-Radio Sunnydale Hall and Oats-greatest hits The Beatles-Sgt. Pepper Collective soul-greatest hits Valerie’s big disc o’ cool cheese (homemade-duh) The Monkees greatest hits (my mix) Back to the 80s (homemade) The Breeders-Pod The Who-Who’s next Iggy Pop-Nude and Rude ELO-double disc greatest hits  Hmmm, maybe this is their karma. Crackhead moron ends up with CD collection of a clearly disturbed individual. I guess I’ll buy one a week until I replace them all. Or, maybe you might have some of these I could copy. I still have the set up for the big disc o’ cheese but the 80s CD? That was the 1st CD I ever made (and clearly the best if I’m still playing it). I do have the cover though so maybe I can work it out from that. Guess I won’t replace the sunglasses. It sucks but I imagine if I had $80.00 to spend all at once I’d buy something constructive like new climbing shoes, sports bras that breathe or tires. Things they didn’t take: Disco, rocket scientist flashlight ANY $1 sunglasses Baseball cap Garage door opener Key to the truck Key to Mc’s car Huge stack of directions to your houses (If I’ve ever been to your house and you live more than 2 blocks from me, there were directions.) Cheap ass CD player Gum and/or mints. I thought drug addicts liked sugar. Well, I have to throw them all away now. I have issues and couldn’t possibly eat them after they were fondled by who knows what.  I really, really hope it wasn’t the thinking of the bad thoughts that caused this. I hope it was because I did some brain-addled damage then promptly forgot all about it.
