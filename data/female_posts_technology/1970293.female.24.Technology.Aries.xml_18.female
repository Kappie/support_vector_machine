It's really sad to think that this could really happen and does happen to young people every day.  In this song the girl is asking for help with her silence from the teacher and the neighbors but everyone minded their own business and doesn't become involved even with someone in so much pain and suffereing.  The song evokes many images with it's soul-wrenching lyrics.    All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003
