We're trying to launch our e-mail preference program tomorrow and finalize the project plan for our content management system migration (so work can begin next week).  Not only can I not give my full attention to both today, I can't imagine how any of us will get the tasks completed for the CMS project in time.  According to the plan, Ben will have to work 176 hours one week in April...  And Microsoft Project's "resource leveling" feature makes absolutely NO sense.  Not to mention I couldn't sleep last night.  At all.  I could barely keep from yawning at 9:30, and by the time I was home, changed, and watching the news, I was wide-awake.  And stayed that way.  All night.  Until I fell asleep and was rudely awakened 10 minutes later by a car alarm.  Busiest day at work this year on top of no sleep whatsoever.  Perfect.
