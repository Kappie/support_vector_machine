My thoughts, dreams, opinions, and random ideas appearing in print and potentially available to the masses. Isn't technology wonderful.      Over the course of this blog you will likely learn more than you care to about me, my family (particulary my girls), my cat (Max) and my various life experiences. Don't you feel privileged? Naw....      Today I started the training updates for a new contract that I will be working on. So far the only thing new is that I'm freezing to death as the airconditioning is blasting the room with cold air. Perhaps if I was not freezing I would be able to concentrate on what's being said in the classroom and actually learn something. I suspect I would as the trainer is one I've had before and is usually a very good teacher.       I suppose I should confess that part of the problem may infact be my own fault. I didn't exactly get the best sleep last night so my ablity to cope with the chilly room and focus beyond that is diminished. Went to bed late and then the baby woke several times during the night.      So here's the first truth...I always go to bed late...I always say, "I'm going to go to bed early and get a good sleep." but I always go to bed late. Part of the reason is that I don't like going to bed. I think too much lying there before sleep the mind starts working and won't stop and I can't get to sleep for all of the thinking. So if I stay up until I am too tired to think than I get to sleep faster...mind you, by then it's past midnight often heading for 1 am and I am a bit grumpy getting up the next morning. Hmmm, so what does this tell me? I should go to bed earlier, right. I know. But it seems either way I'll be tired and by staying up late I avoid the lying in bed thinking about things part.    Thanks for reading my ramblings. I promise I'll try to do better next time.
