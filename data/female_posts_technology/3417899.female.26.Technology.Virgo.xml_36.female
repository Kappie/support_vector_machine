This time hundreds of pounds of explosives were used, the tank and the soldiers practically vaporzied. Nothing left. No bodies to bury.   (In the Jewish tradition - the human body is holy and all parts must be properly buried).   Hundreds of soldiers are now on their hands and knees, on the hot desert sand using small cloth fliters to sift through the sands and find tiny parts of flesh...  The little plastic bags hold a few measly flesh bits.  Nothing left - but dust.
