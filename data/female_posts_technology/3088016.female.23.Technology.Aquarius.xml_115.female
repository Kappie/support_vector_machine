I came out with an invitation to give guest speeches at  urlLink another club  that has about five members out in Tomball and is in a rebuilding stage.  The other person there from my club may join this as a second club, which would work out well because he and I both have a lot of speeches to give before June if we're going to help the club with reaching its goals.  I would have, but I've already got a second club and haven't got time for a third.   I got an email from  urlLink Nora  asking about Toastmasters.  It's interesting to hear that I've been able to share something that at least sparks someone else's curiosity.  If anyone wants to know more about it, there's some great information  urlLink here .  That doesn't mean that I don't like getting questions about it, because I really do.
