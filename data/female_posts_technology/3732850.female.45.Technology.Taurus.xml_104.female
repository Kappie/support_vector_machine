The drama I found was in his will not to fight back because this is how he was brought up. When confronted byanother black man of why he chose not to was something that he hadn't thought of. It hadn't entered his mind. The drama also was hitting the next guy in the stomach when he wouldn't leave him alone.  When translating this to reality, I find black race are not treated equal yet. I feel white people have more rights yet and the black race fights twice as hard as white people to prove themselves.  I have a friend who transferred to my shool during the teen years. Noone seemed to want to help her find the classrooms. I helped her and we are friends to this day. She is native american and actually helped my self-esteem improve.
