And did I mention I have to work this weekend? Luckily, the VP noticed, so hopefully there's a big fat bonus check in the mail. A big fat check I will spend on sushi.  In areas not work related, M is going to El Salvador for a month. This is good because I can figure things out while he's gone, like if I like him or not. We see each other every other day, which fucks with your mind when you're trying to decide on these types of things. So if I miss him when he's gone, I'll make him my boyfriend. Except that I don't want to be anyone's girlfriend yet. That word makes my stomach hurt. Either way, I don't have to make any decisions until January and by then, all kinds of things can happen.
