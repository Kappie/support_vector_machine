I think I've mentioned before that I'm an obsessive email checker, and the panic sets in when I haven't received an email after about five minutes during a normal workday.  Although, it's quite amazing how I can completely forget about email on the weekends.   However, the love of SMS is now taking over from the email thing. And again, I feel the novelty will never wear off.   Especially unprompted texts about stupid things. Gosh, I love them!  Sadly, though I'm becoming slightly obsessive about checking my phone and thinking that I can hear the message beep, when really it was just a bird chirping, or part of a song, or my mother speaking. Seriously.   And I can't express the disappointment when I realise that no, there is no text message and that really, I should just get on with my life.  Also, I'm wondering if anyone makes a mascara that doesn't make me look like Tammy Faye Baker.    It's kind of giving me the shits.  I feel that there is a conspiracy afoot among the cosmetic industry to encourage multiple purchases of mascara tubes.  They do this by making all their formulations change consistency at exactly the same moment, rendering all current mascaras in one's collection to become unusable unless you want to look as if you have spiders crawling over your eyes.  And I think you know how I feel about spiders.
