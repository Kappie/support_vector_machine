It didn't help that I was reading a 1200-page monstrosity that took until page 300 to get good when the Olympics started. I was never so grateful to close the cover of a book as I was when I finished  And Ladies of the Club . And, yes, once I begin reading a book, I must keep at it until it is completed. That doesn't mean that I'm not reading 3 or 4 other books at the same time.  This tends to drive my husband nuts. There are books all over our house either open with the spine up or with various types of bookmarks sticking out of them. Hey, at least I don't use napkins or tissues (sometimes used) like my mother does.
