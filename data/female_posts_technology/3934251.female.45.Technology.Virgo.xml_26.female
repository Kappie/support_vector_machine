Being a married mum of 2, at home I have to take other people's tastes into consideration, after all not everyone likes bolognaise sauce poured over lettuce. And grabbing a snack for lunch at work usually involves a sandwich with limited options for fillings.  I have just had my lunch at my desk, I attracted a few strange looks accompanied by the rolling of eyes and the word 'Atkins' before being left to get on with it.  Hurray.
