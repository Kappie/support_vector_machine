I got called in twice but I need the money so it's ok I guess.  Fri stayed in a chilled, Sat got called into the hospital came home cleaned and put up the shades and went out to Wrigleyville to hang w/ Jeremy.  I feel bad though cause I was so tired and I was really just blah. Sat got called into work again, went to lunch w/ an old friend, picked up Collen from Sean's, went to blockbuster to rent movies, went grocery shopping and was stuck in a horrible thunderstorm.  It was cool though I ran and played in it when I got home.  My son thought I was crazy! It was fun I had not done that in a long time.  I love the rain it just does something to me. I am waiting to hear from my sister right now.  My bro-in-law brought her to the hospital, possible appendicitis.  Man between her and I. I am supposed to go over their tomorrow to hang for the holiday. I am gonna watch my flicks I rented. Laterz
