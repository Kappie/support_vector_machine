So I added a Baffle Box Goose Down Featherbed for the full sleeping-inside-a-marshmallow experience. And it was Good.  Mark did not admit the goodness of all these goose feathers, but he was taking his time getting out of bed.    Friends added to our newfound fascination. Frank (the father of Jacob's best friend Franklin), an enormous, shaven-headed man with an infectious smile and a personality that fills a room from the doorway, looked me straight in the eye. "You gotta get 300 thread count sheets," he confided. "You gotta pay  attention  to thread count." He placed his emphasis on the word "attention."    "We're very into thread count," his wife Lori added, confidently. Oh, my God, they were right.  I was sleeping better, even through all this strife.  On Saturday, it was Mark who saw them first. Goose down pillows. I wasn't even going to say anything, after all we've spent on geese and thread counts. But there it was, right before my eyes: Mark was *testing* these pillows right in the middle of Costco.  He was literally  leaning over the bin  and putting his head on them.  They were the same maker as our featherbed, and they were $39 each, for the King-sized.  The same ones at Linens n' Things were $119, which were a few more Things than I wanted to spend on Linens.  You guessed it. They went in the cart.  I fell asleep last night trying to imagine how many goose feathers I was currently sleeping on. How many geese.  How do they get these goose feathers, do they pluck them and let the geese grow new ones?  Why geese instead of ducks, or, seagulls?  I drifted off into a marshmallow sleep, where I proceeded in my latest series of anxiety dreams about innocently doing something that makes my friend Thomas think I'm a raving lunatic.  All right, so goose feathers can't cure nightmares. But they're a dream to sleep on.
