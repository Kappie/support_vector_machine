Moving is a lot more complicated than I expected.  I have to deal with packing, movers, getting my car moved, changing car insurance, registration, and my license, lots of dr/dentist/etc appointments while I still have good health insurance, financial aid, loans, leases, finding a roommate, figuring out my classes, finding a part-time job, transitioning out of Microsoft, selling stock options, buying cheap software while I still can, cancelling my phone, electric, signing up for new cable, and so much more.  I feel like I'm going to explode with details.  How do normal people get all of this done?  I'm plagued by my attention to detail.  I'm taking a mini-vacation this weekend for 4th of July.  B will be here in less than 4 hours.  We're spending a few days in Seattle, hanging out with friends downtown tomorrow night, then off to Portland to meet B's extended family on Sunday/Monday.  It should be great.  Trinity got her oil changed today, so she's all ready for her trip to Portland.  They tried to trick me into paying an additional $240 at the Infiniti dealership today for a Power Steering Flush and an Ignitian Flush but I didn't fall for it.  Well, I cheated and called my dad who said it was completely unnecessary.  So they put this black mark on my record at the dealership.  In all caps on my bill it says how they recommended these services and I DECLINED.  That's right I did.  They even told me that they put it in the computer.  Ever since they swindled me for an engine flush at 15,000 miles I've learned to never trust them.  I'm not scared of their black marks.  I certainly won't miss that dealership.  Hopefully the one on Comm Ave in Boston is better.  Somehow I think it will be even more expensive.  I need new running shoes.  Ones with red trim.  Maybe I'll check out the sales this weekend when B and I go downtown to see the new library.  It's a very impressive structure.  I bet B will be thinking about the acoustics.  It is made of glass so maybe it will be echo-y.  B did this whole study on the acoustics of libaries, so this is kind of his specialty.  He even lectured about it to the Acoustical Society of America.  Pretty rad in a geeky kind of way.  Whatever.  I work for Microsoft and swear by my Tivo.  My friend Carrie once told me I should embrace my inner geek.  I just can't do it.  I like to think I could be that girl walking down the street.
