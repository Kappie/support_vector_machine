It was rescheduled for next Tuesday.  After the lady apologized for cancelling on me ....she said "you worked for Marcia and Kirk?"  and I was like "Yeah,  I'm actually watching  Justine and Carl(their kids) tomorrow night, you know them"?  and she was like "Yeah, they used used our services through U of M...and were featured in the New York Times about us"  and I interrupted and said "Ohh yeah,  last summer talking about academics raising children,etc...I remember that article...I didn't know they used your services"  and she said University of Michigan, Chrysler,and others use their backup childcare services as well.  Then she said "Barbara and Mike (not giving the last names) sound familar too!"  and I told her "I knew they used their services as backup when I couldn't work a couple times".  She was very excited and said she looked forward to meeting me.  I asked what I should bring,  and she said driver's license, etc...and that they would pay me for the time I am there next Tuesday setting things up.  CrazY!!!  I was  hired on the spot and I'm just going in to fill out all the paperwork.  See what networking does for ya!  Now.....my next plan is to let the parents of the children I will be caring for know that I am done with school after a week long course in summer(Flash),  and I  am searching for an internship/job.  We'll see how it all goes down.   I'm looking forward to starting this job......I love meeting new people.    Going to Starbucks with my housemate CHen.(Chen is so funny and sweet. She's from Taiwan and she loves coffee and style..but more about her later)   She and I are going to celebrate me getting a job.  We are also going because we are addicted to their drinks....especially that strawberry n'cream drink they have out right now.  MMmmmmmmm.....
