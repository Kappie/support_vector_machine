I mean time and again, i withness these "SUCKERS"at work. "Suckers" are people who practises SUCK UP. I mean they huddle around the boss. Say nice things to make him laugh and make him feel wise / important. This is a recurring exercise!Frequency: At least once a day!   And it doesnt help if these SUCKERS work in a team. You will withness a bunch of low life suckers grovelling at that one man's feet. "Ohhhh!! Not worthy. My great one."   *gasp*   bimbo SUCKER goes, " there is no right or wrong answer what...", batter eyelids and flings her hair backwards  boss goes, "of cos there is.. Need to see the way they think..blah blah blah..." beaming with glee that he has managed to "outwit" her yet another time. Both laughs.   *duh*    Save me...   ~cringe~
