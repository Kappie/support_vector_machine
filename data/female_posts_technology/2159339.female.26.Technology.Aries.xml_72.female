Sure, I was one of only two girls, the other one not so much a girl as a grandmother of one of the contestants, but good times were had by all. Greg's brother had a robot in the 10 pound category and also in the 'Royal Rumble'. As I type, I am drafting sketches in my head for my very own fighting 'bot, complete with red stripes down the sides and a flame thrower. And maybe some sort of contraption that blows bubbles.   Afterwards the fun came to a screeching halt as I had piles of work to turn in on Sunday morning, so M cooked dinner and I typed up dumb reports on his computer. We talked about the weirdness of watching your parents' marriage fall apart as an adult, years after it should have already happened. I doubt they will go through with the separation because they're so fucking codependant, but G  I have already decided whom to excommunicate in case they do.   On the bright side, finally saw the apartment and it's soooo raaaad!!!! Looks a lot like the one from Real World New York, complete with the industrial spiral staircase and tons of Space and Light...Batty and I ran around like we were on speed and I tested out the toilets. Moving is set for this Friday. I can't believe I'm doing this shit again..But I've never looked forward to anything more.  Ok. Tonight ice skating and packing. Batty, let's get Gordo's afterwards, ok?
