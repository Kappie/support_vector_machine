Blood, guts, bad story line, and lack of plot made Volume 1 into two hours of my life I can never have back.    It goes something like this:  I wake up from a coma.  Here's a list of people I want to kill.  I go around looking for them and kill each one in a blood-spurting disgusting scene with less plot than a kung fu video game and terrible special effects.  They play an annoying jingle of some guy whistling in the background throughout the entire movie.  Tune in next time, when I go for the second half of the list.  The end.    No thanks!
