Two things: Great music, intense blazing heat. In order to see every single band you love in the same place, you will suffer weekend damnation for it. We camped at the adjacent site, and it was torturous. 2-hour lines for the mobile showers and no place to brush your teeth/wash your hands. The desert sun would rise at 6:30am, turning our tent into a hellish sauna. The temperature reached 110 degrees, transforming my deodorant into the consistency of goopy soft ice cream. The heat will get to you. It will change everything. The things you brought with you will alter states and your body will turn into a sweat machine; you will contemplate whether you need to buy shorts though you haven't worn shorts since high school gym class. It will make you buy a $4 lemonade. Twice. We used protection--hot drippy sunscreen--but our mortal defenses could not save us from sunburn and the ugly and awkward "farmer's tan". Holes in the ozone layer aren't created by the greenhouse effect or aerosol cans, they're made when an ungodly number of amazing bands concentrate in one area. There was a big hole over Indio Valley that weekend and the scorching sun punished us for being so cool.    Abby:  We were only gone for 4 days but we came back changed people. Not only physically (unsexy 1st degree burns), but also mentally and emotionally. There were many times throughout the weekend when I looked at us and thought "We are smart, educated, middle class women - how did it come to this?" I'm referring to our time spent looking for shade like two impoverished hags. First we stealthily crawled over to the side of our camp neighbor's giant tent and lay motionless in the shade. Batty pointed out that it (shade) was getting smaller by the minute as the sun made its way directly overhead. When we were down to an inch, we realized we had to migrate. Lucky for us, there were some palm trees in the adjacent lot so we trudged over. Soon other coachellites, goth, punk and pop alike, joined in. Oh how delightful it was laying around in 95 rather than 110 degree heat, but it did not last long. Soon a gestapo man came out of nowhere and ordered us to immediately vacate his premises. We then walked around looking for the next refuge, which we found near another tent. Doing this for 3 hours and then waiting another 2 in the shower line left us exhausted, but we were determined to make the best of it. So we let the security ladies feel us up and entered the premises of the festival.   Batty:  Here are all the bands we saw and loved while we sweated like hounds in heat: The Sounds, Sahara Hotnights, The Stills, Black Keys, THE PIXIES!, Junior Senior, Desert Sessions w/ Josh Homme and Brody Dalle, Death Cab for Cutie, The Rapture, Radiohead, Mindless Self-Indulgence, Moving Units, Kraftwerk, and Phantom Planet. And that's just Saturday. On Sunday we mainly stayed cool in the removed tents and listened to and peered at Muse, Broken Social Scene, and !!! We watched Belle and Sebastian as the sun set and later caught bits of Dizzee Rascal and Air. We randomly spotted R-guy and W-gal leaving the Bright Eyes show and joined them for a beer in the beer garden. And at night in the cold we watched The Flaming Lips, Le Tigre, and The Cure. We talked about how awkward Robert Smith is and always will be and made up scenarios to put him in: Robert Smith at In N' Out carrying a tray with his hamburger, Robert Smith pumping gas, Robert Smith melting in the unbearable Coachella heat. We talked about our favorite show "The OC" and Abby wondered when they were going to do "a special Coachella episode." Little did we know that we weren't watching it, we were LIVING it...    Abby:  Because, just as we were walking over to Bright Eyes and talking about our best friends from The OC, who did we spot near the Outdoor Theater but  urlLink Seth and Summer !!! I pointed them out to Batty, who immediately knew what to do. "There's only one thing to do - watch  them  watch Bright Eyes". Brilliant! So we did. We giggled like twelve-year-olds behind our sunglasses and hats as we watched Seth and Summer try to blend in with the rest of the crowd. I reminded Batty of our age, but it was too late, we were on celebrity high. Because it wasn't just anyone, it was freakin SETH and SUMMER of THE OC! Snuggling! Anyway, that gave us the energy to make it through the rest of the shows. Well, that's about it. I think we covered it pretty well. On Monday we drove back, stopping at In 'N Out and Anderson's Pea Soup Compound. ...Any additions Batty?    Batty:  When Abby pointed out our friends, I whispered urgently,"We HAVE to stand behind them!" and scurried over and stood right behind  urlLink Adam Brody . She followed and stood behind  urlLink Rachel Bilson . Some people, y'know,  talk  to famous stars, and some people, y'know, stand behind them. They look exactly like they do on TV--clear skin, cute, young. We stood behind them watching them watch Bright Eyes and Abby turned to me and faux-whimpered in horror,"We're 26!" We giggled at the absurdity of us, but that's the way it goes in Hollywood: 26 year-olds playing 15 in the special Coachella episode of "The OC."  To add to the legion of mediocre celebrity gossip, I watched one woman approach them and mumble, "Are you on The OC?" Rachel/Summer said, "I'm sorry?" and the lady repeated her question. Summer was uncomfortable and embarrassed and didn't know what to say. She looked at Seth/Adam and he laughed if off and (referring to Summer) said, "I'm not, but SHE is."  So all in all, it was hotter than hell, my deodorant melted, we spent too much money on overpriced dinky food, saw some fantastic performances, got sunburned, hung out with R-guy and W-gal, stalked Summer and Seth, and never felt so icky and sticky in all our young lives. But besides the celebrity stalkage, we did see something once-in-a-lifetime: Wayne Coyne got inside a friggin gigantic plastic bubble and walked/rolled into the audience during The Flaming Lips show. Now, that's not something I see everyday. My administrative supervisor does not provide me with that sort of ingenious entertainment. So, to recap my recap: sun, bands, friends, and a man travelling in a bubble. That was the Coachella experience for two bad Apples.
