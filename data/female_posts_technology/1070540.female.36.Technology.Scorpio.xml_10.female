I got to install servers I even didnt mind helping the kids set up the trianing rooms.  Yes the kids did it and did it with out fussing I was am so Proud.   I even did small things like decide where to put the picutres/posters.  I need to finish his office tho.  Well maybe when I find me a place to hire me I will be able to do all of that tooo. I know Ken and Justin will go far with this business.  I am so proud of Ken for doing all he is doing and for him pushing Justin into doing Ken. Ken had/has the vision.  He will make sure that company will go far,.  I cant wait for him to finish his book,,,, I am so really Proud of my husband.  I know that this man I love is so smart.  I hope this proves it to him.  Well I need some sleep before for I head off to "User Land"
