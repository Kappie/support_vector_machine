I couldn't fall asleep and was watching late night commercials, knowing I had to get up way too early in the morning and  shower and blow dry my hair. Then a commercial came on... For " urlLink EasyStraight " hair straightening system. I am not dumb and I know these products are not worth a dime, and yet - I went online and bought it thinking - what's the worst that could happen? It won't work! But if it does, I'll have straight hair and won't have to blow dry it every morning...  Wrong. The worst that can happen is that the chemicals fry your hair - turning it into parched, unmanageable, straw-like strands  that can not be repaired.  I can not shave my head (believe it or not - been there, done that). So for now, I'll have to stick to deep dry conditioning and ponytails until  my hair grows back out.   The price we pay for vanity....  (On an optimistic note, nobody in the office seemed to notice today. Then again, they are all  men . They never notice).
