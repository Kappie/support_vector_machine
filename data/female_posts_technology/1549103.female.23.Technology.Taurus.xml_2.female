It seemed like a really good idea at first- he's really great, we get along fabulously, I'm interested in him, he seems at least kind of somewhat interested in me.  I mean, if that's not a textbook example of when to ask someone out, what is?  It wasn't until after all the arrangements were made that I remembered how very bad at the whole dating thing I am, and how nervous I get, and how I hate asking guys out because then there's this awkwardness like do I have to get the door for him? because that's just absurd, and how I try too hard to get them to like me and turn into this fake-laughing sycophant, and how I don't have anything to wear anyway, and OH MY GOD I AM TOO FAT TO LEAVE THE HOUSE.  So that was the state I was in when I went to pick him up.  
 Luckily one of us is not a mental case, and he kept the conversation rolling despite my ridiculous level of nervousness.  I did have a good time, and I just have to remind myself that no matter how much I dislike first dates, they are a necessary prerequisite to second and third dates.
