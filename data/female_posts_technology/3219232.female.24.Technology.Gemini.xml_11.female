I remember for about a month how many years back, August and Everything After was the only album playing in my car. For some reason, Counting Crows made me feel mellow. It relieved me of the stress from driving in this country-It helped me cuss less at the idiotic motorists that I would come across. I didn’t pay much attention to the lyrics of their songs, but since they sounded good, I sang them anyway.  But for some reason that Saturday afternoon, that song struck a nerve. The lyrics hit me in a way that never did before. It made me realize that I was in a situation that I was not ready to handle. I thought I could because this was not the first time I’ve ever been in one. I have developed a defense mechanism that prevented me from getting emotionally involved. I’ve always been a carefree person and it was always about having fun-no strings attached. Whenever I felt that things were getting intense, I would retreat and move on to other adventures. Things were easier that way. I’ve worried far too much and been disappointed over and over. So I’m sick of it and I’ve pretty much had enough. Never put your feelings on the line. It’s like gambling where the stakes are high-it’s either you’re a big winner or a sore loser and it’s hard to earn back whatever you’ve lost. And I’m not ready to take that risk-well at least, not yet.  I know that life involves a lot of risks and if you want to live and grow as a person, you’ve got to take them. I don’t know when I’ll be ready. I’m still trying to build a relationship with myself and this situation isn’t helping. Oh, and it’s scaring the shit out of me! I have to get myself out of this before it gets any deeper. But I’m sure that eventually, I’ll be brave enough to take them again-knowing very well that I’ll be strong enough to handle whatever pain those risks might entail. I find that it is essential that there are times that we should take risks and there are times that we should avoid them. It’s all about knowing yourself and allowing yourself to grow at your own pace.     urlLink http://www.songlyrics4u.com/counting-crows/anna-begins.html
