I had a few mis-starts (okay, more than a few!). I usually restart everything when I do something 'bad' - like not exercise for more than a week, or eat way too much for a few days in a row. I guess that might be sabotaging my progress but I'd like a really clean start. I've been doing great for the past few days though.  So now I'm at 165lbs, again. I was 155lbs about 6 months ago but because of a few dozen things which went wrong from July 2003, I've started piling on the pounds. I won't explain what those are because it really is for a whole different blog. Ideally I'd like to get to 135lbs, but I've not been that weight since I was 15. I'd be happy with 145lbs which was where I was about 5 years ago. You can actually chart my weight like that. It goes up and down between the periods but every 5 years I put on 5 more pounds, not a good sign I'm sure.   So what's my plan? Basically it's like this ..   Meal plan  Breakfast - Special K with milk, some fruit Snack - fruit or Power Bar/granola bar Lunch - as usual Snack - same as above Dinner - protein shake or Special K ** Special - one 'bad' item (ice cream, choc, cookies)   Workouts      - 45 min treadmill (with 10min warmup/cooldown) .. 4 - 6x per week    - toning (arms, legs) - 3 - 4x per week  Not a very good plan I'm sure. The main problem I'm having is that my mom is a spectacular cook and she loves to cook so there's always a huge quantity of food around. So that's why I have lunch (or dinner) where I can have what she cooks .. but only one meal. On top of that I have a really thin sister who just loves to buy and eat chocolates and junk food. I hang out with her a lot and as such .. I eat them too! I'm looking to lose 5lbs every 5 weeks, and to get to 155lbs by the end of 10 weeks .. although I think with some effort I can do that sooner.
