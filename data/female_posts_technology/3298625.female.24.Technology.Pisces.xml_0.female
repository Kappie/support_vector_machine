So anyway I'm in the states (incase you were wondering)I go to a college called waldorf in Forest city Iowa. Iowa nuff said, forest city is tiny, extremely tiny, however this is where they make the world famous winnebagos. yeah so atlest there something happening... lol.  I miss my family in Tanzania, so much but in two years I will have my degree and it had better be worth it otherwise I will tear it up.  So it is saturday today nothing planned, but on friday night I had some japanese food, okonomiyaki, it is a japanese pizza great stuff, some friends and I made it, ok, ok, so they made it and I watched.. had some green tea and a sort of saki that girls drink on 'girls day' in japan. Don't ask. anyway I lan to make them so pilau next weekend that should be fun. hopefully it will turn out ok.  anyway now I gotta go back to bed it 7:08 AM for heavens sake.
