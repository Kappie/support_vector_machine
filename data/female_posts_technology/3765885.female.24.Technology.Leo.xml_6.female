But definitely lots of fun!  Can still remember the 1st time i went to NTU. Ran into a group of graduates running around in their acadamic dress having their pictures taken... and there i was... all envy... and now! Before you know it! I am wearing my academic dress having my pix taken... running around school with excitment~ Weeee~~~ I'm finally out!!! But I am really sure, I will miss these schooling days! All the mugging, and most of all, all my friends, the fun we had and the loads of stuff we ate for all the countless suppers!  Ok... really tired... time to call it a day... zzzzzzzzz  Good luck to all those still mugging out there! Your day will come!!! Just like mine!
