So it all works out for the best. 10 things I learned this week.  1. Painting your fingernails in the morning meeting is just as unacceptable as banging you head on the table to signify “bored now”. 2. To calculate celsius degrees to fahrenheit degrees you double the celsius number then add 30. Example: Today in Edinburgh it’s 9 degrees celsius. 9x2+30=48 degrees fahrenheit. (It’s snowing there too by the way. Wacky Scotland) 3. Women are stupid. (Yeah, I already knew this but whoa to me every time I forget for 10 minutes.) And I’m beginning to suspect we’re all insane as well. 4. Little boy’s pajama bottoms make excellent winter leggings. And the pre teen patterns are so much more festive than anything you could find in the adult department. 5. Cats think bubble light reflections are bugs that need to be toyed with, killed and then eaten. 6. There’s an entire new season of AbFab out there! Saffy has a baby, Eddy has a tanning bed installed, Patsy baby-sits. Drunken British mayhem ensues.   7. Learn to appreciate hangovers. If it were all fun and games every jackass would be doing it. 8. Before she was on AMC Greenlee was in a workout video with Marky Mark and the funky bunch. Yo yo, Greenlee, feel the vibration. 9. The Smithsonian traveling display of metal lunchboxes will be at the Atlanta International museum of art and design starting January the 8th. The opening night reception begins at 6p.m. A cocktail party for lunchboxes. Cool. 10. A four-year-old princess  does not  need to know all the words to “loser” by Beck. Santa Claus is watching you  and  the princess and everybody’s getting a spanking if the princess gets kicked out of pre school for singing “soy un perdedor I’m a loser baby so why don’t you kill me” repeatedly.
