How wonderful it feels to have a palm-sized gadget in your hand which does everything from surfing the net and scheduling to making calls and now to behave as a stress buster!! Now thats something I have read recently about and was as surprised as you are right now.But its not something imaginary or just a concept.Ed hardy of Brighthand.com discusses the unusual uses of a handheld.In his words, a company called DreamFree is demonstrating at Comdex this week the Peeg, a peripheral that hooks up to a Pocket PC and is supposed to stimulate different types of brain waves ( according to News.com ) The device has settings that DreamFree says increase the wearer's concentration or memorization ability. It supposedly can also bring about feelings of relaxation or energy. Now that's something , that surprised me.If this is the rate at which technology is developing, it wont be long when we will see technology batting a thousand in our lives!
