Her plane got delayed in AZ because of weather and she was supposed to come in at 420 am then it was supposed to be at 230 so I got to OHare at 1230 to find out it was delayed till 419pm. I was not happy. In the mean time my birth mother called my phone to see if she was in yet. That was so awkward for me. I have not talked to the woman since I was 5 yrs old. I was kind of off the whole day. Dena is cool as hell. She is 18, tall and skinny, beautiful and has a lot of energy. Kind of like her older sister. LOL Was busy running around and doing stuff all day. This is the first chance I had to rest and I need to get my butt to bed cuz I have to work in the morning. I have more to say but not much time so I will fill yall in tomorrow. Good night!
