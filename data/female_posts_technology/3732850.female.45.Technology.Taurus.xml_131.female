The writer wrote in a tone that was relaxed and calm; I assumed by the title that they just all went their seperate ways in life. It was written in more of a story than an essay.  Instead of crazy I should actually say it was more Ironic. The people that came to help them out and save them, actually end up killing them, another thing I didn't expect. Everything happened so suddenly, I had to read it twice to see if what happened actually happened. Right away I didn't know what to think, I had some mixed emotions and thoughts. All around it was an okay essay.
