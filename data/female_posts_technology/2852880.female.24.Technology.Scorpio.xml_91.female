We went there because it wa s free but seriously my hair smelt so bad so i had to shower.  cj and jason and giorgi had a good time.  scott had fun until we left murphy's then he haeed to het out.  i mean jet out.  then giorgi displayed his hidden talent for origami and now i have a cool flower made from the label of a bud light bottle.  i won't say who was peeling their labels.  fun night.  maybe tomorrow i'll post pics from last night which was also lots of fun.  g'night.
