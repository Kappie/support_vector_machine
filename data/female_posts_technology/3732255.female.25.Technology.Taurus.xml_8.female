The sountrack to the game won't be out until the Fall, however, if you live in Cleveland, OH and listen to  92.3 Xtreme  you might have gotten a chance to hear the track once. As we get more details, we'll lt you know, but Asylum tells us to be excited, so we're doing as we're told.   Via  www.punknews.org
