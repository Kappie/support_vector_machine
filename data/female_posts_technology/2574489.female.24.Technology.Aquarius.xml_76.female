I was wet, cranky, and couldn't bring myself to make the extra drive to school.  I wanted to go home and change into dry clothes! So I did.    A pile of three-day old dishes waited for me at the sink.  My note of  Please wash the dishes , had been overwritten with,  I didn't have time to do them, I promise I'll do them later .    I admit I wen't a little psychotic.  I screamed with frustration unrelated to the dishes and called my husband at work.  I got his vm. I left him a psychotic message about never doing the dishes.  I may have shrieked at the end.  Needless to say, he never called me that night and stayed late working overtime, to avoid his hag wife.  I have since apologized.  Husband, I haven't gone crazy like that in a long time, right?  Most of the time I am sane and loving, right?   ***  What's my problem? Do I not care about work anymore?  I came in late today.  Supposed to have come in an hour early for training. Came in my regular time.  I was so embarrassed.  I told my sup that I was embarrassed and he said so was he...ouch!  I don't think he's impressed.
