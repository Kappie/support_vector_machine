Last time somebody broke my heart was 6 years ago. Yesterday was Day1 of my new single life, pushing the two heart pieces back together, and there were certain people and certain things that made the journey less lonely and a bit smoother:  *catching a free  urlLink Metric  show at Amoeba, then Ethiopian food with dear Abby *a brand new episode of The O.C. and tea and cookies with Abby and Seth Cohen. *The "2-tone box set" (70s ska) on loan from my excitable music geek co-worker *A cell phone with W-gal on the line telling me she's driving by my house and waving. I'd just taken a shower so I waved at her through the wall.  In my glumness it's heartwarming to see people still genuinely excited about things. It makes me want to feel that way soon. And even though I'm heartbroken, I'm glad I have friends who'll help me turn the sobs into laughter.
