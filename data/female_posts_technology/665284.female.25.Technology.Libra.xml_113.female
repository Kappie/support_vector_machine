Notice too that in Crying the name of the deceased is Washington while in Mano it is Antonio, but both are called Tony.  I was irritated at the couple beside me during Mano Po 2 because they were discussing the relationship of the characters to each other, the traditional Chinese funeral and what-not till the end of the movie!  Talk about rudeness.    Tama ba ang sinasabi nila? Are they speaking correctly?   Referring to the times when the characters speak in Chinese (subtitled).    Why did he do that?  What does the paper being thrown out of the funeral car mean?    Bad trip!  Hello!  Just watch the movie!  The parents of my sister's best friend gave my sister a puppy yesterday. We wanted to keep it, but we would not be able to take care of it properly since we live in an apartment so mom told my sister to return him.  Downloaded two Love Storm mp3s.  On Vanessa's question regarding Balzac, I bought it for about Php700 @ A Different Bookstore in Glorietta.  If you want, I can lend it to you. :)  It is interesting.
