It was pretty empty at Bottom of the Hill, which was unfortunate for the bands but fortunate for me, as I scored myself a stool and rocked out whilst sitting comfortably and sipping water. I also talked to Bart Davenport, babydaddy candidate #2 (after Adam Green). He shook my hand and hugged me, which caught me a bit off guard. I was hoping he would do the creepy soul-searching stare into my eyes like he does on stage, but that didn't happen. Anyway, I'm pregnant with his twins.
