Suspect that I won't be retained in this job, hence no point working so hard to proof myself.  3. It is not my interest. (Then what is?) 4. There's no motivation (in terms of wealth, fame, recognition, challenge, satisfaction).   Maybe I need a break? :)) hahaha.. which I already had many. I think it's just the mood I'm in today. Just don't feel like doing anything at all.   I've a colleague who's on the same contract as me. She is very motivated and hardworking. More hardworking then some of the seniors here. I wonder what is her motivation. To be retained by the company? I guess that should be my motivation as well huh? I remembered being motivated, and wanting to learn more. I seem to have lost that since last month. I think I'm complacent. I dont see a future in this company, let alone this department/team. My prediction (which is always inaccurate) is my team will be 'cut' in 2 yrs. This department will be gone in... 3 yrs, and the company will pull out of Singapore in 5yrs. Unless, the marketing people can do some magic and bring in more sales, or the economy picks up within the next 5 yrs.   I think it is just my character. My motivation burns out real fast. No matter where I go, it'll be the same story.
