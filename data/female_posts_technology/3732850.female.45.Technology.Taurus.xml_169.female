She tells us of her past through child like eyes but through an adult voice. She gave these examples through a paragraph like this: “Most nights my dad could finish the milking and catch up to us before we made it past the garden and carry the jug for us, teasing us all the way. By the time we got to the trailer and Dad had washed up, we would have supper on the table and a large, cool glass of milk setting at each place.”
