Crawling in my skin These wounds they will not heal Fear is how I fall Confusing what is real   Man, if I were 19 I would have thought that was sooooo deep. Still,  Linkin Park  has everything I love: lots of angst, lots of anger, a bunch of shouting all with a nice beat.  Actually my favorite band for the last 6 or 7 years has been  Front Line Assembly  if I go by a) number of albums bought and b) the amount of time I listen to them. They're loud, angry, and have a good beat, too. The best thing about their albums is to figure out which science fiction movies they sample from.
