But till date, I never actually thought about what I learnt from each of them.  Thats pretty, coz as a HR person I should have actually found a reason behind the attraction towards each case...  Today while sitting at work, I was pondering over my nightmares which I have been getting for over 2 weeks on and off, and I figured, there is obviously a lack of completion in each case.  But what is it that was missing..then I realised, a lesson from them!  I think I can talk about two major learnings I have had, from all the relationships I have been involved in to date...  1.  Ethics : Every relationship is governed by certain ethics and values which bind us to our daily lives.  We cannot assume we are above or below those standards, never try to break away from those ethical standards, it will only conjure up painful moments where one will stand caught in between Morals, ethics  values on one hand vs. emotional tie ups/ commitmetns!  2.  Silence : Sometimes silence has this amazing power which can heal a lot of problems. Words said in haste, can only but wreck even small chances of fixing a pace maker to the heart of the relationship!  My sessions at yoga have made me realise this to a very good extent!  To tell you the truth, actually had a chat with a close friend of mine, who is now rocking the products world in Hyd.  He kindof made me think about a few things in my relationships, why I have been confused, why I am trying to drive at peace and not being able to reach my destination!
