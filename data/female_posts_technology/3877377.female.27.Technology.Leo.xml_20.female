Every year you introduce a new class of freshmen to the wonder that is college basketball.  You teach us how to be a community, how to bring all majors together in support of one interest, how to be a  family .  You instill both students and team with an overwhelming amount of pride in our school.  You bring alumni together at least twice a year to watch Duke battle Carolina.  You have built a basketball program and a team that engenders such loyalty that alumni come back, year after year, even if it is just to see Duke play an exhibition game.  You have been there for some of the momentous memories of my life.  You were there when Duke defeated Carolina for the first time in my college career, sophomore year.  You were there (ok, maybe just on screen) when my heart broken for Trajan Langdon when Duke lost to UConn in 1999 and I watched in tears from your beloved Cameron Indoor Stadium.  You were there in 2000 at the Georgia Dome when Duke defeated Maryland for the third time that season.  You were even there for the highlight of last year's Christmas vacation - a trek to Cameron to watch Duke easily defeat Davidson.  I just can't imagine Duke basketball without you.  I feel sorry for the future basketball players that would be robbed of your tutelage and guidance.  You've kept many players in school even when they knew their careers would benefit from leaving school early for the NBA.  You're part of what makes college basketball so much more exciting than the NBA.    Please don't desert us.  We've always looked up to you and honored you.  It would break our hearts to see you go now.  Sincerely,  A Member of the Trinity Class of '99
