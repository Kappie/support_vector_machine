Of course I am always the bad person.  I'll just sit there and take his criticism and insults. I have been dealing w/ all of that for 12 yrs and we have been broken up for 5 yrs. Go figure. I wish he would just vanish, but we have a son together so I am stuck w/ him in my life forever! Man that is a really long time.  Need to look for jobs and houses so I need to get my ass in gear. Me, Charity Marie Benevelli vows from this time on not to let the little things get to me and focus on what is important.  My son and family,my friends, the band, my job and what ever else that may come along that will be important to me.
