Back to Iraq also has  urlLink more,  Iraq Hack has  urlLink published  and Iraqi Spirit follows a review of the Falluja incident with these observations;  ~   urlLink Ever since the creation of Iraq, it has been like a pressure cooker that is waiting to blow up.    ~   urlLink At the end of the day there are some underlying problems that have been there since before Saddam has come to power and they simply need to be fixed.   ~   urlLink Iraq and Iraqis need to have a long period of peace and tranquility, to heal them internally as they have never experienced this kind of life for any sustained period of time.   And from where i am? These two quotes extracted from a  urlLink paper  today;  1. An (un-named) senior pentagon official focusing on al-Sadr and his followers; "We are going to focus on dis-banding them, de-arming them and we'll do that deliberately and with a plan". (Aye? As opposed to without a plan? Accidentally?)  2. Abu Musab Zarqawi, quoted as an Al Qaeda operative, in an audio tape aired on an Islamic web site; "We will not let you off, you snakes of evil, until you lift your hands off our mosques and stop shedding the blood of Sunnis".  Well, what a swell party this is.  I can see things are going swimmingly and expect peace shall be restored in no time at all, with the efficiency, tact and diplomacy that we all know and trust so.
