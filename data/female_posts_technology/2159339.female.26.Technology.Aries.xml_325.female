Perhaps it's because it's "that time of the month", or maybe it's because work is banal, or maybe because I'm a half-orphan now. He kept saying, "Tell me what's wrong" but I couldn't pinpoint it to specific reasons. I just felt bogged down by an inchoate cloud of sadness. So we talked for a while and then I drove to Cala Foods to buy ingredients for a carrot cake.   I stayed up late baking birthday carrot cakes with hippie ingredients: whole wheat flour, unbleached all-purpose flour, turbinado (raw) sugar, and frosting with no "beet sugar". (Yes, I'm secretly a hippie.) I slept a little and woke up at the crack of dawn to frost them and arrange walnut pieces into "flowers". I piped onto one "Happy Birthday Green Marble" and onto the other, "Happy Birthday XX." Baking is fun! Baking dispels clouds of sadness! The smell of cinnamon and vanilla turns sad clouds into carrot cake clouds!  Unrelated: lately, I've been in love with pugs. Pug dogs and pug puppies. I saw one last week and I wanted to dognap it because it was so cute. Now, normally I'm an animal hater and think they should all be caged, but now I will make an exception for the pug. I proclaimed my love for the pug to XX and he said, "Your biological clock must be ticking because my ex wanted a pug, then she started talking about having kids." And I said sarcastically, "That's a great generalization to make based on one person." What an idiot. Who said anything about wanting kids? Human kids are stinky and have chocolate smeared all over their faces and grimy hands. I stated calmly, "I want a pug. On my own. I don't want the pug to have a stinkin father-figure. If I ever get this pug, I'm going to the pug bank and getting it by myself." I told him all this because it's true. I ain't sharin my pug with no one! Except maybe Abby... and Green Marble... and Jason... and my family... and all my friends... and the homeless guy on the street.   If I ever have a pug this is the name I will christen it: Sir Petrus Bartholomew Maximilliam, III.  I will call him PB Max for short. Or Barky.
