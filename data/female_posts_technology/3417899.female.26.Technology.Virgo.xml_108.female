I promise this won't happen very frequently.  Here we go:   1. Grab the book nearest to you, turn to page 18, find line 4. Write down what it says.  "I had spent my youth traveling with a band of itinerant goliards, given to them at a young age when my mother died."   2. Stretch your left arm out as far as you can. What do you touch first?  Other side of the couch.   3. What is the last thing you watched on TV?  Law and Order, Criminal Intent   4. WITHOUT LOOKING, guess what time it is. 9:15 AM   5. Now look at the clock, what is the actual time? 9:22 AM   6. With the exception of the computer, what can you hear? Birds in the tree outside our living door window   7. When did you last step outside? What were you doing? Yesterday. Came back from a movie.   8. Before you came to this website, what did you look at? Statistics of hits on my web site.   9. What are you wearing? PJ Tshirt, panties   10. Did you dream last night? Yes   11. When did you last laugh? Yesterday   12. What is on the walls of the room you are in? An oil painting painted on a canvas fan.   13. Seen anything weird lately? Nothing that comes to mind right now.   14. What do you think of this quiz? Egh.   15. What is the last film you saw? In a movie theater? I, Robot.   16. If you became a multi-millionaire overnight, what would you buy first? Pay off all my parents debts. An apartment in Israel. A house in the USA. An apartment for my brother. A university diploma :-)   17. Tell me something about you that I don't know.  I am more sinner than saint.   18. If you could change one thing about the world, regardless of guilt or politics, what would you do?  Cliche - but I would make peace. If that's too much - then at least peace in Israel. Still too much? Then peace amongst the different Jewish sects.   19. Do you like to dance? More than anything.   20. George Bush: Is he a power-crazy nutcase or someone who is finally doing something that needed to be done for years? I would say neither, but if I had to chose it would be closer to the latter.   21. Imagine your first child is a girl, what do you call her? Noy.   22. Imagine your first child is a boy, what do you call him? Ariel.   23. Would you ever consider living abroad? I am living abroad. And If I wasn't - yes. But only temporarily. I would always come back home.
