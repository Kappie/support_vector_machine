There's my mom and all my aunts and uncles... there's my grandma in the casket... all my cousins are here... here we all are, dressed in black again... there are the huge wreaths of roses again... here's the funeral director again... Hey there's Chi Tram's new baby... ohmygod that baby is enormous... that baby is the Sta-Puft Marshmallow Baby, goddamn!...   Here we are praying again... the priest is saying comforting things for the grieving, but I don't feel anything... I don't feel sad, I don't feel grief, I don't feel like crying at all... what's the deal with priests anyway? what kind of god gives man a sex drive but enforces celibacy? what is a priest who takes vows of celibacy, then has sex with altar boys? what is up with the catholic church!...   here we are tying the white cloths around our heads again... why do i feel like i'm ralph macchio in the karate kid?.. hey, i can feel my heart beating in my skull... throb, throb, throb... uh, better loosen this knot; it's a little tight.  here we are chanting again, the familiar drone of rote praying... there's the kind-faced priest from last time who starts the Hail Marys and Our Fathers in English... here we are again answering in Vietnamese... hey my aunt's responding to the Our Father with the Hail Mary ending... she's going on automatic!... here I am saying the prayers in Vietnamese... I know the phonetics, but what am I saying? Ugh I'm a total charlatan, what am I doing here... hey! she just did it again! She's chanting the wrong response! isn't she paying attention to the prayer?...   last time at grandpa's funeral i remember the candelabra swaying spookily... ops, there it goes swaying again... here we go walking up to light the incense and do the bows again... here I am looking at my grandma's body in the coffin... she really doesn't resemble herself... what did the mortician do to her mouth and jawline?... oh look, she has gloves on; I was wondering how they'd cover her purple hand... why is she flat-chested? she used to have a big chest... do boobies shrink in death? that is really weird... her hair's pretty cute... her dress is pretty...   here are my cousins sobbing again... why are they so sad? maybe they were closer to grandma because they were older and back then there were less cousins and thus she lavished them with more attention... wait, what is this? am i jealous? no, no, i just feel guilty for not feeling sad... I'm trying to justify my lack of emotion... why is it that women cry and men don't really?... why do they expect women to cry? I'm a woman and I'm not crying... for men it's forgivable because they're "strong" but if women don't cry it's almost wrong... jeez, i know that afterwards everyone will talk about who cried and who didn't... I better bring an onion tomorrow... I better bring one for Saturday too.
