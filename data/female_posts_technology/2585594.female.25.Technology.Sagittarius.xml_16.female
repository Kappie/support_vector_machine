I let go and leaped into the unknown, with eyes closed and arms open I decided to try and live the 'good' life, starting today.  One of these, I'm gonna try to make last, the other is good for 40 days as my Lent 'panata', and then God knows what will happen when that's done....  Eeni-meenie-mayni-mow. You figure it out. I'm too busy looking at the good side of things to dwell on these matters. But someday, I'm sure it'll creep up on me. But until then, I'm free and happy, and lovin' it hahaha.
