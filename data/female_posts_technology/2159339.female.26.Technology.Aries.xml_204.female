It's really not fair, but I'm ever so proud of the little bastard. After all, he did sacrifice at least 4 good years of partying in favor of classics and The Economist. Now he gets to move to NY as a reward. Maybe we can become a brother-sister badass journalism team. It's true, I don't have any training, but he can edit my articles. Or instead of articles maybe we can write a book about growing up in the eastern block. I've actually been approached about this by parents of some of my friends, but had refused to even consider it since I had forgotten so many details of my life in the motherland (and because my writing isn't good enough). However, since G  I had practically identical upbringings (down to being in the same grade and music conservatory), he can fill in the blanks and edit the book. And then I'll be able to quit this rat race. See, I'm trying to think of things I can do with my life that don't involve data entry. My boss mentioned a coordinator position opening up soon and told me to 'think about it' but I don't know what that means - she either wants me to apply for the position or wants me to feel bad that I'm so behind on my work that they have to hire someone else to do all of my fun projects so that I can concentrate on stupid data entry. If I apply and don't get it, I will be very bitter and I will quit.   Still sick from a few weeks ago. I was doing better last week until they told us at Sunday's kayaking class that we have to learn rescue and recovery techniques. An hour later I was in the freezing bay waters hoping my partner would rescue me quickly. It's a very strange feeling capsizing your own kayak for the sake of practice, but that had been my biggest fear as a novice and now that I know I can survive the ocean waters, I can get better at this sport/leisurely activity/whatever it's considered. M agreed to do the 'full moon' paddle with me in May.  In other news, Mom and I are getting along famously. This weekend, I randomly told her that she treats me shitty by burdeoning me with all of her unrealistic expectations. She said no, I do that to myself and use her as a scapegoat. I then started crying pathetically and told her that I'm sorry she got so unlucky in this lifetime with a horrible daughter like myself. I don't know what she said after that because I was running away to my car in dramatic slo mo. I felt bad the whole day and went over there again that night to see if she was mad. Of course she is  never   mad at me, which also drives me crazy. She met me at the door holding a fruit salad in her hands and proceeded to feed me all kinds of other goodies. The next day, while hanging out at the cemetery with my fam (me, G, parents, two grammas), I made a pact with myself to try to accept these nutty people as they are not as I want them to be (cultured  refined) because I know they're thinking the same thing about me. Going well so far.  Today going out for a run with Green Marble. So far exercise has been limited to Bollywood dancing and Tae Bo at the house, but I think I need a good run. There's no better day than today to start that kinda thing, right?  Called M a few minutes ago. He's in DC on some photo conference. Instead on talking about my day, he made me look stuff up on the internet for 15 minutes for his photos, that little jerk. Made me miss him a little less.   Shit. Work Bryan just came over and said really loud "WHAT IS BLOGGER??!!".."I don't know. What the hell are are you talking about you psycho?" I answered. So I better get back to 'work'.
