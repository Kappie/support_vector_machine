There dhoti’s compromise of a long thin white cloth that wraps around their waist. What’s unique about this type of dhoti is that it’s practically sheer and see-through ..so while your pandit is doing arti you get a full blown view of his tighty whities… the reason they wear see-though dhoti’s is because they are celibate and no one can have them …so to rub it in your face they decided that they can be a tease…shame on u..  2) Guju Garba Dhoti’s – Most of the men who wear these types of dhoti’s are young adults during the week of Navaratri. These dhoti’s come in various bright colors with exotic embroideries. What I luv the most about this style is when a young man jumps up to hit their partners dandia during raas…their dhoti fills up with air… resembling a balloon…and you get a tasteful glace at their gorgeous legs…  3) South Indian Fishing Dhoti’s – The men who usually were this style are fisherman by profession and wear their dhoti’s very high to prevent them from getting wet…almost resembling one of Paris Hilton’s micro-mini skirts…What amuses me the most about this style is the guts a man must have to wear his dhoti so short that when he bends over one can see his little chaddi…oh and might I add this type of dhoti fully exposes legs…yippie…  4) Bengali Devdas Dhoti’s – Now this dhoti is very complicated and long…so if your stingy with fabric this type of dhoti is not for you…This style tends to occupy your waist by holding up your dhoti..and your arm by holding the tail. So at all times a man has to drape his dhoti tail over his arm so that he will not trip over it…now here is a scenario.. a bengali devdas dhoti wearer wants to wash his hands in a public bathroom…does he hand over his dothi tail to his fellow neighbor to hold on to while he scrubs his hands clean…I wonder what happens to the dothi tail…ummm…  5) I Ran Out of Fabric Dhoti’s– Now these dhoti wearers are usually poor farmers that don’t have much money to spend on an extra foot of fabric…What’s unique about this style is that they are not fully exposed like the South Indian Fishing dhoti wearers ..these men only show their ankles ..so they leave much to the imagination.. those poor farm girls…now you know why farmers in India have so many kids ..once a farm chick sees those legs she just can’t get enough…naughty naughty…   If any of you guys come up with additional categories please feel free to comment below and let me in on your insight…   also..check out spiderman in a dhoti:   "CORRECTION"   : as per Mr. C-man...he stated that the spiderman in a dhoti link which was available here prior to 07/26/04.. impared his informative personal copyright law..so to all my viewer i'm sorry...
