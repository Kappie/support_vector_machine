You may or may not get over it by the next time you meet.  Hockey fans are more intelligent than football fans.  Hockey fans go home when the game is over.  "Seasoned fried potatoes" are french fries.  If you can't figure that out on your own, you don't deserve to eat.  If you are a hotel guest and you are talking to me and I do not respond to you in any manner, go away.  If I have to tell you to go away, please don't think I'll be offended if you call me a bitch.  If my brother happens to be here, watch out.  Although calling a bartender fat and slow may be truthful, it's really not nice.  Please say it behind his back...  He still manages to provide me with decent service and I'd like to keep it that way.  No matter how annoying the other guests (and employees) may get, this is still some of the best free entertainment one can find.  :)
