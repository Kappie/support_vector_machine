My dosage is 5x its normal amount and I will be entering guinea pig territory tomorrow...they will attempt to alleviate pressure in my head caused by a tumor that we can't seem to get control over.  I have no idea what shape all this medical crap will leave me in for my weekend adventure in NYC.  Will I have legs? I hope.  Will I be able to stand? I hope.  Will I be able to move? I hope.  Will the pain subside long enough for me to at least put on a good front so those that don't know me well will not see thru my facade...one where I am well and able.  Dream big dreams and hope for a bright tomorrow!  Blessed Be!
