I'd been told of this book whose writer did not use the letter "ey" (first letter in the letters-series) in the entire book - from beginning to end! Hundreds and hundres of words... with this fluent story... one wouldn't even notice!  I believe the book is in French (or something of the like).   So, somebody took this book (don't remember who - but I should! He/She deserves it!), then converted it to English. The entire book! While still keeping the rule throughout the book's entirety.   Wow. How inspiring...  Is is VERY difficult! Indeed, I could only JUST finish this short blog...
