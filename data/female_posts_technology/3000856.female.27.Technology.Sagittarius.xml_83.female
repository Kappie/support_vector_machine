It's weird when you have a sister and you have to catch her up to speed and catch up yourself. We have 18 yrs of making up to do. I can't believe she is leaving tomorrow. That time just flew by. My cousin Vickie had the baby yesterday. It was a boy. Baby Daniel was 7lbs 5oz and 21 inches long. Another baby to add to our gigantic family. LOL It was a good day in baseball yesterday. Cubs won and Sox lost. I actually watched the Sox game! I know can you believe it? I had my reasons for watching it. By the time I got home and cleaned a little and packed some more and hung w/ my sis, I once again did not go to bed till almost 1am! Oh and one other thing that happened is Mike sent me the instrumental of a song he wants to work on. I have been writing a lot lately so I had lyrics that fit perfectly and the melody is pretty much done and what I want to do w/ it. Damn that is probably the fastest I ever worked on a song. 5 hrs and I was done! Yeah me! LOL
