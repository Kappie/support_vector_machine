It was a grueling weekend, but fun too.  We learned that packing is a lot more fun with music.  Now I have 35 boxes all packed and ready to go.  Just a few more left.  A few things didn't make the cut, so I've been giving away lots of stuff.  Plants went to Jason.  Booze went to Dan.  The hoola-hoop went to Sharalee.  Some big t-shirts went to Ciesel, the homeless guy in front of my QFC.  He was hoping for men's jeans, but I couldn't really hook him up.  I have a big bucket of gesso, if anybody out there paints - I'll give it to you for free!  I bet most people don't know was gesso is - it's this white acrylic thick paint that you use as a basecoat for oil paints.  I love it!  It's thick and goopy.  I always wanted to stick my whole hand in the bucket but never actually have.
