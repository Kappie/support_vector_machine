It will be different at least. But hey, you need to experiment with these things.  The other night I made a new compilation tape for my car.  Every now and then I get the urge to put together songs based on a theme for listening in my car (I don't actually have a CD player in my car, just an old fashioned tape deck/radio).  It started off being an 80s nostalgia tape with a bit of Spandau Ballet to start off with, however, the choice of songs degenerated into a diva-festival with Dusty Springfield, Lena Horne and Shirley Bassey. Go figure.  Then, I felt the need to include a bit of Alanis Morrissette, Indigo Girls and The Smiths.  So, don't be alarmed if you see me driving, wearing my drag queen footy scarf, singing at the top of my lungs, and then five minutes later down the road, wiping the the tears from my eyes feeling slightly depressed after hearing 'How Soon is Now'. :)
