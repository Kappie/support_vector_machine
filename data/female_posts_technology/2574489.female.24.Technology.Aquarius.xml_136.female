He has no acting talent whatsoever, and the only redeeming quality of this movie was the laughs it gave hubby and me cause we were making fun of it the whole time.    Cheaper by the Dozen --I loved the kids! They were so cute. Hilary Duff was a tad annoying. Tom Welling was another eye candy but with actual talent. He should have been on the screen some more (wink, wink).  It was a light-hearted comedy that's good for the whole family. It also made me want to have kids. Hehehe...   The Family Guy  (various episodes)--This is the freaking funniest show I've seen in the longest time.  Very Simpsons-like in its dysfunctionality but it has its own brand of charm and hilarity. Go see it!  It was canceled in  season 3 but they're bringing it back because of high demand.  And last but not least....   Troy   What can I say about this movie? Except that Brad Pitt was hot. Really Hot.  Eric Bana was also hot. Really hot. Orlando Bloom was cute. Really cute.  (Pauses to wipe drool from mouth).  I echo what other women have mentioned. These good-looking guys were a bit of a distraction at times. How can I concentrate on Achilles' inner turmoil when his torso is so ripped?  All lusting aside, it was an enjoyable, well-acted, well-directed film. Peter O'Toole was stirring in his performance, and the ballet-style duel between Achilles and Hector was a sight to see. I give it a thumbs-up.   Other Highlights of my Weekend   Gave my brother his b-day gifts. He's now 11 years old! I chose a wooden samurai sword for him, and hubby got his a foam nanchuk.   We celebrated his b-day at Saltgrass and I had the yummiest cheesecake from there. It was soooooo good. And I don't even like cheesecake!  Man, can't wait for next weekend!
