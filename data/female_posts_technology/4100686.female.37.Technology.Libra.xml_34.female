Perhaps if there were more visitors or if anyone showed particular concern about the provision of a more committed comments facility, then Iraq Blog Count would look into other alternatives.  In fact, guess what, i think i'll hold a referendum about it.   Those in favour of better comments facilities please say Aye, those opposed, you can say Nay. Now send your vote to;  urlLink email Iraq Blog Count   (If there are no votes there will probably be no change).
