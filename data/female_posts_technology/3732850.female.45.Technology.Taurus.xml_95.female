We can see by the outside that there is graying, wrinkling, aging, sagging, crippling, and decaying and assume subconsciously that that defines the person as a whole. When in fact that that is not always the case, there may be the mind of a 30 year old in the body of a 84 year old.   This essay will relate to my reality in the way that I will be more sensitive and understanding of the elderly in my personal and professional life.
