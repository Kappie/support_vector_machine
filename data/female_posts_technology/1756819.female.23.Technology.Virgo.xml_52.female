Not each one at a time, but on a rotating schedule.  I worked on each one for about 10 minutes to half an hour, then switch!  We've been getting things in three of our projects all synched up and my bosses were testing so we could push up a release tonight.  So, boss 1 discovers an issue in project A, update, push up.  Boss 2 discovers an error in project B, fix, push up.  Boss 2 has a question about project C, take a moment to answer.  Have a meeting for project D, drive over to client, come back, boss 1 is waiting with another issue, boss 2 has a couple more questions.  Boss 1 finds some strange data in our database... And so on and so on, all day long.    *phew*  This nutty (though strangely satisfying) day is over and I can go home and not think about work till Monday.  Life is good.
