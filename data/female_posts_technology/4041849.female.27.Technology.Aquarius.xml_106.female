You are extremely focused and difficult to distract from your tasks. With luck, you have learned to channel your energies into improving your intellect, rather than destroying the weak and unsuspecting.Your friends may find you remote and a hard nut to crack. Few of your peers know you very well--even those you have known a long time--because you have expert control of the face you put forth to the world. You prefer to observe, calculate, discern and decide. Your decisions are final, and your desire to be right is impenetrable.You are not to be messed with. You may explode.      check out the test:   urlLink http://hokev.brinkster.net/quiz/default.asp?quiz=Better+Personalitypage=1    i'm not sure if this is right or not... i don't think it is... i'm totally easily distracted from the task at hand. for example, i haven't done shit at work all day. now i'm going to have to take it all home. heh. i don't think my friends find me remote and a hard nut to crack... or maybe they don't tell me that cuz i'm inaccessible :P i may need to take the test again. heh...
