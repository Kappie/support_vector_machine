Cattiness always makes me laugh because I'm always pleasantly surprised when I meet someone who can out-mean me. Example:  Me: Hey, look at Hapa-Hottstuff. He's carrying a tiny Pomeranian. Who does he think he is, Paris Hilton? And look at his girlfriend, she looks like J-Lo!  Catty (turning to get a better look): J-Lo?! More like J-NO.  Me: (laughing hysterically.)  Catty: Or more like J- HO !  I shouldn't brag about my meanness, but it's really because I'm envious. I want blown-out pumped-up hair, big beige lips, and a closeted boyfriend.  The best part about the picnic was that I sat next to this girl I work with who's pretty, slender, stylish, and makes me feel kind of mannish in comparison. It was a sight to see her totally chow down and eat two plates of food. People eating a lot always forges an immediate bond with me. I was fascinated. She ate very fast and had a very methodical way of eating her second plate, a huge hot dog:  She plopped down next to me and started digging out the innards of the lower-half of the bun. Her movements were fast and squirrel-like. Mr.Hottie asked, "Hey, what are you doing over there? Low-carbing your hot dog?" "No," she said curtly and continued digging. I turned to him, "Duh, Mr.Hottie, she's creating a BOAT for her HOT DOG!" She ripped off the corner of a mustard packet and squeezed thin lines of its contents into the ditch. Same with the ketchup packet, same with the relish. She placed the hot dog into the trench and proclaimed "Open-faced hot dog!" and bit into it with great zeal. It was amazing.   Other things I did this weekend: didn't convince XX to take me to see BartD, as he's totally broke too. Ate the consolation smores he made me on Saturday night. Had pig-out-all-you-can-eat dim sum with my family Sunday morning because one of my cousins just won big in La$ Vega$. Requested encore smores from XX on Sunday night. Watched "Easy Rider" for the first time. Have crush now on young Peter Fonda.
