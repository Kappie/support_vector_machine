She couldn't sit still for more than 2 minutes at a time.  Tiring just to watch her.    But despite that, the girls had fun.  We started out with a charades type game to illustrate the power of words.  They really liked that.  After the game I pulled out my candy jar.  You should have seen their eyes :)  When I said that they had to sit down before getting any candy, they quickly found their seats.  Candy works well on these girls.  As they were munching away, we managed to get through two lessons, which surprised me, cuz they were so loud.  But they did come up with good answers so they were listening too.  I think the girls are warming up to me now, they were sharing all kinds of stories with me about their friends and school.  I'm getting to know them better too.    I'm looking forward to next week, cuz I have a craft planned that ties into the lesson quite nicely.  I used to love doing crafts when I was a Calvinette, and I know the girls will love it too.  Next week's lesson also suggests a great game that the girls will love.  Planning lessons for my girls is a lot of fun cuz at this age they are so receptive.
