My aunt called me tonight at work and asked me for directions to my house cause they are going to come and visit tomorrow, which is great cause I haven't seen them in about two years. So I called Duane and asked him to clean up the house and told him they were coming. Well he got all pissed off cause he had to clean. Our house is a complete right off when I am working, I believe I have gone through this topic before. all I can say is thank god I got the kids rooms cleaned and our room cleaned on the weekend. at least I don't have to worry about them. I just need the living room and kitchen cleaned.   I also have one other worry. Our dog, harley, has never been around other dogs. The only time he sees them is when we are out on walks, and he freaks out at them, but his tail is always wagging. My aunt and uncle have the same kind of dog as us, rottweiler, which is their baby so I know they are going to bring her tomorrow as well. I am worried about how Harley is going to interact with her. I really hope he does not try anything. I will keep you all posted on how we make out.
