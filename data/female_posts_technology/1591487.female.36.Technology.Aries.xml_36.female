While at work during this alleged 'holiday' period (well, for some anyway), I was doing my usual obsessive blog reading and coming across a whole lot of new ones, where the writers were doing quite a lot of expressive swearing and making me laugh.  So, I thought I'd try on the 'swearing voice' and felt a diatribe about creepy creatures would be an appropriate forum for expletives.  It was fun, but really, I don't think I can sustain it. The swearing that is, not the diatribes.   Is it all over then? Is it done?  Is the eating, spending, gift-giving, celebrating, socialising, stressing, tiredness over?   Crikey, I hope so.     I really did have a lovely Christmas, and enjoyed the nice bits in between the madness, but I'm also glad, as usual, that all the palaver is kind of over and routine can be established again. (Clearly, displaying my tendency towards being Mrs Rainman with the whole 'need for routine' thing again).  Happy New Year, by the way, I was remiss to mention this last time because, clearly, I was too busy swearing.  May 2004 be tremendous and full of love, laughter, cups of tea, good coffee, time for friendships and kinships, peace and calm for all of us.
