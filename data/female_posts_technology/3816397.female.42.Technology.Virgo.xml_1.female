The treadmill is a NordicTrack C1800.  Not very top of the line, but not entry-level.  Including delivery it was around $900 when we bought it, but I digress. We bought it in March last year.  So it's out of warranty for labor, but parts are still covered.  First call to tech support I was pleased to learn they'd let me install the replacement part myself and save the labor charges.  The tech put me through the diagnostics and concluded that the problem was a bad motor controller board.  This seemed reasonable based on the symptoms I had observed.  He ordered one to be sent to me, which I duly received 3 business days later.  This was on the weekend of the fourth of July. I installed the part.  To my dismay the problem persisted.  I called again on July 6.  Next diagnosis was a failed power board.  One was ordered.  I received it within 3 business days.  Installed it.  And the problem persists.   I called again this afternoon.  At this point we have diagnosed the likely problem to be a failed motor, which may be feeding current back to the motor controller board and zorching something.  I am now awaiting the delivery of a motor and a motor controller board.  And today's tech had the courtesy to upgrade the shipping to UPS Air so I should have it in hand on Wednesday.  And then we shall see if the problem is fixed.
