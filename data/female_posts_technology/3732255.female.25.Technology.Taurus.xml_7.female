However, in the world of corporate record companies, the small "boutique" A records became part of  Interscope Records  who clearly could not embrace  MxPx  even though the band's continued to have a growing fan base and toured to sell out venues. After years of frustration,  MxPx  and  Interscope (A) Records  have parted ways...  The band is currently in the studio working on new material and weighing their options for future releases. Mike Herrera commented that "Anything can happen from here. We're really excited about what the future holds. We feel like schoolboys on the first day of summer."
