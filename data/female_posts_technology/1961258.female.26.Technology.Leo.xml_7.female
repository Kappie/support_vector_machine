Will do my workout in the evening, not such a good thing .. compared to a.m. workouts, but it's better than nothing. I'll try to do 60min treadmill + 15min bike + 15min bike .. plus some easy toning for arms  abs.   I have my eye on a digital scale with bodyfat calculator. The price is a little steep $350, so I will have to forgo my DVDs next month. Sacrifice for my health/weight :) Should be cool to track my weight, bodyfat .. although I bet it'll be discouraging at the moment. The last time I measured my bodyfat I was 33% (at 150lbs.) .. and then 44% (at 160 - 180lbs) .. so now I could possibly be 50% bodyfat .. WOWZA!!! Although through the HealthCentral tool (which uses your height, weight and body measurements) my bodyfat is only 23%. I wish!   I was reading my old posts from a diet forum, from 1998 - 1999, and boy .. wish I could go back and kick myself in the head/ass. Because I was 140 - 147lbs, 38-27-38 and I thought I needed to get down to 125lbs!!! Stupid, stupid, stupid! But there were lots  lots of external/environmental factors then that contributed to that really distorted body image.
