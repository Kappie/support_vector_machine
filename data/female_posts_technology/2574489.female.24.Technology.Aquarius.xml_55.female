I need to stop being a slave to rice. I need to stop being slave to carbs period.  I feel motivated, I really do, and hoping that the monthly fee I shell out to  urlLink 24 Hour Fitness  will motivate me even further, as well as the svelte bodies that abound in the location I'm going to enroll in.  Hubby has given me the thumbs-up...I'm all set to sign up.  However, he didn't give me a thumbs-up for their personal training sessions (18-week sessions, 2 times a  week for $900).  Ummm, maybe when my paycheck balloons a little bit.  My goals: Lose 10 lbs. and get down to 24% body fat.
