Today - I encountered another type of security measure - and quite a strange one at that:  As I was walking through the security line, the security-person asked me how my name is pronounced. I answer. Then he asked me how my last name was pronounced. I said it (it's quite a long name since I had, in my stupidity, decided to happened it when I got married). "Can you say that again?" he asked, and leaned in to listen careful to my pronunciation. I did. Then I asked him what he was doing - and he said he needed to see how I was pronouncing my name and what kind of accent I had...   ????  What kind of accent I had? Luckily, I have a near-American accent (or at least one that can pass off as American) so that my pronunciation didn't raise any doubt. But what kind of security measure is this? For starters, I have many American-born friends with foreign accents... Secondly - I thought profiling was illegal in the great US of A. And last but not least - if profiling is finally allowed, then is an  accent  the criteria to profile by?  And on that same note - I never did understand the deal with taking off your shoes. Sure, that terrorist-wannabe had explosives in his soles. But is that truly a reason for everyone to remove their shoes at the security gate? What if a terrorist is found carrying explosives in his/her underpants? Will we be asked to remove those too?  I'm  all for  security, heck, I spend most of my waking time on airplanes and need them to be safe - but there's gotta be some sense to it!
