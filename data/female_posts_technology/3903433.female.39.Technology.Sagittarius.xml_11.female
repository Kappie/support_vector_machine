When journalist Bob Woodward asked the president-select if he asked his father for any advice, the response was: "He is the wrong father to appeal to for advice... There's a higher Father that I appeal to." When Woodward asked: "Well, how is history likely to judge your Iraq war?”, Bush replied: "History, we don’t know. We’ll all be dead."       urlLink http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/04/15/60minutes/main612067.shtml      We have assaults on our environment that may be accelerating the process of global warming, leading to potential scenarios as depicted by movies like "Day After Tomorrow".  We're close to reaching the phenomenon in time known as "Peak Oil", with no true alternative energy solutions in sight.       urlLink http://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/RRiraqWar.html     is an interesting article.  We're deeply in debt, with no end in sight. Did you see the MoveOn.org TV ad "Child's Pay"?  We have war with Iraq (see the ratical article) and have, in a short time, lost the good will of a lot of countries who now rightfully view us as a rogue nation.  We have seen a precipitous slide in our rights and freedoms as Americans (Patriot Act), and the looming possibility for martial law.       urlLink http://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/cahML.html     We also have the Left Behind groups who feel after the disappearance of millions, those left behind will be forced to choose sides in a spiritual battle:       urlLink http://www.leftbehind.com/     Some thought the second coming of Christ would be in 1000. Then 2000. And now we live in a world burdened with an increasing human population and dwindling resources, and why hasn't the second coming occurred already? Is it because they have not yet accomplished all of God's will by ridding the world of evil?       urlLink http://www.counterpunch.org/cook02222003.html     Americans need to arm themselves by informing themselves. We need to register to vote, and hit the polls in November. And we need to ensure that the election results are not stolen again by companies like Diebold. Otherwise, we may be facing irreparable destruction.
