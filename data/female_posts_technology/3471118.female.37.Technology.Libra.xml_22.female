I have to keep reminding myself that I need to be there, that it'll be over soon, that there's only so much he can do to hurt me, and that Bobby will be there with me.  It doesn't really help, but at least it gets me in the door.  I'm taken back and have to sit in the chair, waiting and nervous.  The dentist comes in and seems to be understanding of my fears about being there.  He tells me he isn't going to do anything without letting me know first and he'll try to be as pain-free as possible.  He's obviously trying to calm me down and relax me.  It takes a while to get me to open my mouth, but he says he won't do anything, he just wants to look with his mirror.  He pokes around in there for a while and is being pretty good about letting me know what he's doing so I can stay relaxed.  He doesn't find anything wrong and says I just need a cleaning.  No cavities to fill or root canals to perform, nothing major.  I hate getting my teeth cleaned and start to get worked up again, but he's doing what he can to talk to me and keep me calm.  Bobby being there, talking to me, encouraging me, and telling me it's okay is helping.  I like knowing he's there and keeping an eye on things.  So I let him do the cleaning.  It's uncomfortable and it hurts to keep my mouth open that wide for that long, but he lets me rest my jaw when I need to.  The scraping makes me bleed and I hate that taste, but I can rinse and it goes away.  I hate the sound it makes too.  There's music playing so I try to concentrate on that instead.  His hand doesn't slip and he doesn't cut into my gums or anything so it isn't too bad.  When it's finally over I'm really relieved to be getting out of there.  I won't have to come back for a while, and at least I know I could get through it.
