However, one very cute older couple's daughter visited the small Church we attend nearby with them today.  This daughter had been one of my many friends I had at the prior Church; it was nice to be able to see each other again.  Although our reunion was dampered by the discussion of our beloved pianist at our old church dying recently of a sudden death.  The pianist's funeral is today and neither of us are able to attend.  She shared though with me the shocking events that took place recently:  the pianist's husband leaving her last Fall, her diabetes kicking in strong, some seizures, and rumors of some sort of cancer that was over taking her body.  One of the General Session members went to her house and found her dead.  Having found my own husband dead in our apartment nearly two years ago, I know the rush of emotions he must have felt and probably still feels even though the pianist wasn't his own wife; however, we are a close knit group.  As such, I am sure the rush of emotions were just as strong as if it were his own wife.  What then makes this day glorious?  I think today's sermon helped to make today glorious as serving as a reminder to be humbling.  The pianist was very humbling and never let it be known to the congregation that she had diabetes or other ailments, yet she served God in bringing music and joy to others. She never once complained and continued to serve God to the best of her ability.  Do I think that she was, perhaps, wrong in not letting others know of her ailments?  Yes, to a degree; she just didn't want to come off as a complainer; however, sometimes things need to be shared with others, and that in itself can be a very humbling experience to admit that one is not perfect.  One particular verse stood out among the others being read today --  Philippians 2:3 :  "Don't be selfish; don't live to make a good impression on others.  Be humble, thinking of others as better than yourself."  I really like that verse for some reason, in addition to my other favorite verse 2 Timothy 2:15.  I think I will add that to my creed.  My Grandma seemed to live in this accordance; she certainly didn't care what others thought of her impression upon others; she was simply herself and thrived on helping others out.  My life has been modeled after that; I hope any pray that I can live up to my Father's expectations, as nicely summarized in Philippians 2:12-17 . . .  "Dearest friends, you were always so careful to follow my instructions when I was with you.  And now that I am away you must be even more careful to put into action Gods' saving work in your lives, obeying God with deep reverence and fear.  For God is working in you, giving you the desire to obey him and the power to do what pleases him.  In everything you do, stay away from complaining and arguing, so that no one can speak a word of blame against you.  You are to live clean, innocent lives as children of God in a dark world full of crooked and perverse people.  Let your lives shine brightly before them.  Hold tightly to the word of life, so that when Christ returns, I will be proud that I did not lose the race and that my work was not useless.  But even if my life is to be poured out like a drink offering to complete the sacrifice of your faithful service (that is, if I am to die for you), I will rejoice, and I want to share my joy with all of you.  And you should be happy about this and rejoice with me."       A Prayer:   Thou who art over us, Thou who art one of us, Thou who art: Give me a pure heart, that I may see thee;      a humble heart, that I may hear thee;      a heart of love, that I may serve thee;      a heart of faith, that I may abide in thee.  Amen.  Dag Hammerskjold, Sweden, 20th century.      A Prayer:
