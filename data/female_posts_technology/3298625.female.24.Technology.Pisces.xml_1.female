Yeah I have quite a night a head of me. If and when I finish I will then go on to my business class homework, decision making and creativity. Dear reader I am not creative at all. Then I think I will do some laundry and clean up my room. That should be fun. Soemone tell me if a pro-choice stand contradicts feminism.. I am lost here...  Had dinner grilled cheese sandwiches made by Lindsay, on her new machine and cokes provided by me yee.. so later. Is there 'the one'? I wonder.. if there is, where is he?  Oh well one of those questions... nite nite...
