When he mentioned about the theater and how they did not take ticket orders over the phone for people with dissabilities. I think that the writer of this essay made it plain right there that the theater discriminated against disabled persons.The MAnager comes out wavimg a copy of a policy for disabled patrons like it was the bible. AFter humiliatin the author he then proceeds to show him to the door or the floor in his case.           Hockenberry uses this story to not only share how it felt to be a person with dassabilities, but also to show a side of people that is usually not ever shown to anyone.A persons fear can prevent someone from getting to know those that are different.THe author used very discriptive words in describing how he was treated.          Discrimination of people with special needs is not only moraly wrong but it is also a crime that many people commit on an every day basis and dont even know it. When people can accept everyone they will not have all of the problems that they would normally have.
