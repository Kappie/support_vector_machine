It just occurred to me that I might never live in NY again.  And I might never live in California either.  How crazy is that?  I wanted to live in Paris for at least a few months.  Will that ever happen?  And will there be time for me to become a famous painter?    I am contemplating starting a life plan.  There's a lot I want to do, but I'm going to have to prioritize it.  Like in software, you just can't do everything.  I sort of have a checklist in my head.  Teaching elementary school is on it.  And selling a painting.  And writing a book.  And having a baby.  I've always meant to be super fasionable for some stint of my life.  That sure won't happen without a lot of work.  I've got some planning to do.
