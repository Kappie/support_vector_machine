I wanted to share this with you as it is one of the most moving things I've ever read. This is taken from a speech that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave on April 4th 1967, exactly a year before his assassination. The speech was entitled "Beyond Vietnam", but its basic premise was more to do with the changing face of history and our part in its formation.    We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. In this unfolding conundrum of life and history, there is such a thing as being too late. Procrastination is still the thief of time. Life often leaves us bare, naked and dejected with a lost opportunity. The tide in the affairs of men does not flow, it ebbs.   We may cry out desperately for time to pause in her passage, but time is deaf to every plea and rushes on. Over the bleached bones and jumbled residue of numerous civilizations are written the pathetic words... "Too Late."
