Then while watching the game I had a few drinks of the alcoholic variety. Empty calories, I know. That was it until I went to bed I think.                   Saturday, started off with melba toast (I’m addicted) then probably a yogurt, um I can’t remember if I ate anything between then and dinner. If I did it was melba toast, guaranteed. Then I had salad, 6 chicken nuggets (baked but still terrible) and rice for dinner. I ended up snacking on more melba toast after dinner and maybe some mushrooms? I also had a coffee later on that night. Oh, and I think I had some orange sorbet that day.                   Sunday, more melba toast, some salad, a few mushrooms, and then I had a Mr. Sub turkey wrap for dinner. It was really good but I was hungry about half an hour later. I also had a yogurt after supper, some veggies, and melba toast I think, then some orange sorbet at bed time. Good grief, I’ve really god to kick the melba habit, don’t I? It’s a good thing I didn’t try to do low carb.                  I just weight myself before lunch, and I am proud to say that I actually HAVE lost some girth. To date, I have lost 6 pounds! I'm as surprised as anyone. Also, I've lost up to a half inch off my waist, (this one comes and goes depending on the time of day) ½ inch off each thigh, ½ inch from around my ribs, between ½ and a full inch from around my hips, and the same from around the tatas. (Damnit.) The only measurement that hasn’t moved is my upper arms, but I guess they can wait. I was almost certain I was imagining things getting smaller, but apparently not. Not too shabby.         G      uess what else? FOUR DAYS LEFT!!!
