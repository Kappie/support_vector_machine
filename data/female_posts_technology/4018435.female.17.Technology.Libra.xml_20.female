Yes...I AM hyper...and I'm in a slightly better mood today. We test drove the car and it was amazing! the turbo engine on it was great! Smoke all the lil civics in the neighbourhood. Now, I'm not a big fan of american cars, but the talon is still mitsubishi! Well...the turbo one is...the ESI version is just a neon engine put inside a nicer body.          We stopped off at a store to buy paintball equipment for my bro. I'm considering buying myself a paintball gun so that I can start going. The only problem is my breathing. i can't run cuz of my terrible health.            Today I learned more closing procedures at work and a few more keyholder responsibilities. I'm really liking it and I'm getting the hang of things. I'm gaining a bit more confidense in myself towards work. Once i get more hours and a better paycheck, I'll be able to buy off all the games in my hold bin!          I got to talk to Josh today online. I'm so happy! We're possibly meeting up on saturday to hang out. I'm most likely going to elements again to meet up with him this weekend. Kevin and I will probably head out there.         My neck is itchy...I wore Mike's necklace a few nights ago when i went dancing...and i forgot how allergic i was to it...i can't wear metal...ow! somebody stop the burn!          Well, I'll be home all day tomorrow until karate starts and then I'll be hanging out with Kevin to play games and binge on junk food once more. In the morning I'll be clearing out my room cuz I'll start painting it on thursday. YAY! My new room! I can't wait!                       Just keep smiling.      -The Lonewolf
