Although today I was able to get in my fifth workout (30 mins cardio and 20 mins abs and weights,) I also ate crap all weekend. Saturday I had a Wendy's salad for lunch, but I got the one that comes with the chicken strips. Then, I ate a whole lot of peanuts because for some dumb reason I bought a big bag of them bulk.  My dinner was healthy at least, salad, chicken, potato and corn, but then after dinner I think I ate a fruit to go, some sorbet, and then I went to see a movie and ended up eating some of Ryan's nibs. Not a great day overall. I was determined to make today better. I started off by eating melba toast, then umm...some more peanuts...then I had a few spudz sticks, which aren't that bad, but for dinner I had spaghetti. With salad, but still, carb nightmare. Then just now I ate about 1000 peanuts while watching this movie. I drank a lot of water with them too so I'm feeling incredibly, disgustingly bloated. Also, I have to take my inhaler. Peanuts always make me kinda wheezy...probably should stop eating them but they're soo good....lol.      Anyways, so yeah, totally blew the weekend, but what can you do. I am surprised I have gone this far without spaghetti. This week, I think I'm going back to the first week's plan of two shakes, three snacks, one meal. I seemed to snack less when I was eating breakfast, so I'll try that and see how it goes. Five workouts seems to be working for me, so I'm going to try and keep that up. Here is something interesting: The scale at the gym, the slidey one, says that I weigh at least 5 lbs less than mine does. It actually says I'm less than 170, which is shocking since I haven't seen that weight since I was like 16. It also says I've lost a pound this week, so I'm hoping that's consistent with mine ;) See you all tomorrow.
