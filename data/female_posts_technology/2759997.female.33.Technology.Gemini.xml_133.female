I found myself wishing it wouldn't come back, but in the almost 4 years I've been here, there have been multiple times I've spent hours waiting to see if the power would come back or if they would just go ahead and close the office.  And after 30 minutes, no power (read "no AC") can be horrible in Nashville.  I have to say, I'm glad to be back at work and comfortable, rather than sitting in the dark, surrounded by sweaty people.  :)
