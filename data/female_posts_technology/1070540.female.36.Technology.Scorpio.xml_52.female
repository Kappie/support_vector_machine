Phyliss and Big Rickey came up the week before and had taken Brian with them to mawmaws.  They came back with a camera and a toy.  The kids   (especially Austin) felt bad.  He said he never gets anything.  He asked mymommie if she got it for Brian and she looked at me and said no she would never do that to her Grandkids.    Well today, I asked MawMaw not to say what she said about the camera being to have proof Uncle Gary is bad.  I told her what the teacher said. But MawMaw got upset with me.  She said that she never bought Brian a camera.  I apologized to her.  But now I feel bad.  Oh well............
