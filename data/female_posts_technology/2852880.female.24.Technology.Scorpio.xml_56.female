I'm not what you call a natural bowler.  I certainly wasn't born to bowl.  There was only one round out of three where I wasn't in last place.  But who's counting?  CJ is in a league, which is kind of funny because the only people I know who participate in bowling leagues are Fred Flintstone, Al Bundy and Dan Conner from Roseanne.  Even ignoring the fact that none of those people actually exist outside of fiction, CJ doesn't exactly fit in with that crowd.  So I have to assume there's something about bowling that I just don't get.  Anyway, CJ taught me how to bowl.  I didn't even know there was a right way to bowl.  I mean all you do is roll a big heavy ball into some pins.  Anyway, it was pretty fun.  And definitely a cheap way to spend a Saturday night.  My beer was only $2.75.  After bowling we went to this karaoke place across the street called The Rickshaw.  It turned out to be a Chinese Restaurant.  I'm not a big fan of Chinese Restaurants because I really don't like the smell of the food.  So I wasn't very upset when we couldn't find good seats and had to leave.    Then on to the Lava Lounge in Belltown.  I sat between CJ and Jay Fleugal.  I don't know if I spelled his last name right, but he's a nice guy.  I wonder why I've never met him before.  He likes to call Shotgun before we're in sight of the car.  CJ and I had a strange conversation about two totally separate things which left us each thinking about our own issues.  I think that's what happened anyway.  Jason was there too.  He told me he always has an internal party going on.  I think he should show it more!  Giorgi was really intense about bowling, and at Lava Lounge he started to literally play with fire.  Nick was kind of preoccupied with his girlfriend.  And I'm not sure what Paul was thinking about on the other side of the table.  We stayed until they kicked us out around 2am.  Then we went to Nick and Paul's place.  I wanted to go to Giorgi's place to say hi to Walter but CJ and Jason wouldn't allow it.  They thought he might be already in bed.  So at Paul's place we played with the XBOX karaoke game.  It was actually pretty fun.  Singing badly in a group isn't so bad.  Then CJ drove me home at 4am.  Jay got Shotgun.  I slept in today.
