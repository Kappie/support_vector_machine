I told him he has a small penis. I told him that he is dull and boring. They are empty fighting words, but I hurt him. I want to hurt him the way he hurts me.   I got angry that he ogled my model-like friend at my family gathering, though he vehemently denied it. I got upset at how he points out things about my appearance that I'm already aware of and already insecure about ("Your hands are very wrinkly... Look how big your head is... It's weird how you have fangs.") I am tired of having to explain things to him, like why Vietnamese people do certain things or why I want to eat greasy meaty savory things in the morning instead of cereal or like, a pancake.   He thinks I'm a racist, but I think I'm just too tired to indoctrinate another whiteboy into my very personal, very cultural customs and idiosyncracies. He says he doesn't understand why I'm like this (i.e. VIETNAMESE) since I was "born here." I tell him that just because I was "born here" doesn't mean I didn't grow up in a microcosmic vacuum of Vietnam in my parents' house. I'm too old and too tired to train someone to love me for who I am and for how I am. I thought that dating someone older would guarantee wisdom and worldliness and understanding, but I was wrong. As the late Aaliyah put it so succinctly, "Age ain't nothin but a number."
