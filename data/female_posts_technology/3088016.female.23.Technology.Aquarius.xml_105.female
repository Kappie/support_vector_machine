I spent nearly an hour and a half last night blogging about the trip, and that was supposed to be the highlights.  When trying to check my links I lost everything and was too disenchanted to start over.  So, here is the super-condensed version.    Friday   Arrive in Chicago Lunch at O'Neil's Pub  urlLink MetroDucks  Tour Nap  Dinner at  urlLink Pizzeria Due    Saturday   Shopping on the Magnificent Mile (hey, it was cold there!)  Chicago Cubs Baseball Game   urlLink Bar Louie  by Wrigley Field Nap Evening and dinner at  urlLink Navy Pier   urlLink Hancock Observatory , just in time for fireworks show   Sunday    urlLink Field Museum   urlLink Shedd Aquarium   urlLink Adler Planetarium  Visited and promptly left  urlLink Kitty O'Shea's  Nap Bike Riding along Lake Michigan Dinner at  urlLink Trattoria Roma    Monday     urlLink Chicago Mercantile Exchange   urlLink Art Institute   We ended up doing everything that Ferris Beuller did on his day off except for be in a parade, but that had no influence on where we went or what we did.  I absolutely love this city and hated to come back.  I do have somehow make a living, so I returned to the 9-5 (actually 6-6) world today.   We did take pictures and I have lots of observations.  I will write about them all later.
