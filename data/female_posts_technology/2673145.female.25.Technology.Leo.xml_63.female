When we went to collect our luggage, a middle-age man took our luggage and showed us the way out. I thot, "hmm.. so nice of them." But when we were almost at the sliding door, he asked for tips. Disgusted by this behaviour, sis stopped him and insist to have our luggage back. We reluntantly gave him 5,000 rupiah (equiv. to S$2) and he gave me a displeased look. Maybe it's the way Singaporean are being brought up not to tip. However, we do give tips when necessary, esp when the service impress us.   We arrive at the hotel and were made to wait 1 hour for the room. Disappointed, so no tips for the porter. I believe they could have done better by showing us to a waiting suite they have. Esp when I told him that my sis is sick (and dozing off at the chair) they did nothing to make the wait more comfortable for us. Well, at least he apologised.   Nonetheless, the hotel is pretty alright. Nice environment, not too bad for a 4 star resort. Clean room thou the towels look yellow, but hey, there's enough towels for the head, face, body and feet.  We napped until 5 and set off to explore the shopping area - Kuta. We dropped by the beach on the way and the moment we step into the beach area (Kuta beach), we were 'welcomed' by the locals, selling us services like massage for S$4, braiding the hair, etc.   We went to a famous restuarant in Kuta - Warung Made. The food is yummy. No wonder there's a constant stream of people coming to the restaurant.  We shop until the shops close at 10pm and it started to rain heavily. We decided to catch a cab to go back to the hotel. After all, the 15min walk is not going to be very pleasant with limited street lights and muddy path.   We got up early the next day, had a small breakfast (what the hotel server was pathetic) before our diving operator came to pick us up. After about 30mins on the road, we arrive at the dive shop (that look like a house with courtyard). We filled in the forms, paid the money, arranged the gears and equipment and we are at the (Sanur) beach after a 5min ride. The boat ride was 30mins and we suit up and jumped into the calm water.   The coral formation was beautiful at Nusa Penida. Althou not vast or great, the colours were vibrant. Marine life isn't fantastic. We saw a couple of leather jacks, trigger fish, eels, nudibranch, pipe fish, garoupa, etc. We saw two huge titan trigger fish (at least 1/2m) at different time and our dive guide took out his knife incase this trigger fish decided to attack us. They are very protective of their environment and won't hesitate to nip off your finger or flesh if you come too close.  Towards the end of the first dive, the current started to pick up. We were being swept along. As I was facing to the side, I didn't notice that I was drifting towards a coral and I bang into it. That gave me some scratches on my right hand - the one that has no gloves. Lucky only my sis witness it or it'll be so embarressing.   The tides were moving up, you could see from the boat that the current were moving really fast even thou the surface is so calm. How can you tell? Just look at the fish in the sea, swimming so fast but not moving at all. Haha.  We went down to our 2nd dive after resting for an hour. This time was a drift diving. Just maintain your bouyancy and let the current carry you. Occasionally swim in the opposite direction of the current to slow down - which is quite tiring. The current is so fast that we can't observe much of the marine life. And most of the time I so worried that I'll lost my buddy and the dive guide that I'm not looking at the corals but at them. Haha. It was a good experience with the current even thou we didn't see much marine life.   We went back to the hotel to wash up before heading towards shopping again. Yesterday was more like checking out the prices and what they have. So this time, we made all the necessay (and not necessary) purchases. We were so tired even before the sun set but we held on to finish our intention - shopping!! We walked back to our hotel by 9 and relaxed at the italian restuarant at our hotel. Nice ambience and quite nice italian food. Finally, we went back to our room to pack our bags for tomorrow.   Bali is so packed with Aussies.. the wave's not as good as in Australia.. I don't know why they would make the trip to Bali to surf. It's so easy to tell that they are aussies. Even before your hear them speak.   Its a short trip, not fantastic but a good break. It'll prob be nice if we could stay a few days more in Bali to explore the mountains and other villages and learn about their art and culture. Having said that, I don't think I'll go back there again. Kinda boring for a city girl like me. ;P Haha.
