(He doesn't know how to drive.) It is such a treat to ride home with someone you like very much while seeing downtown SF from such a great view. It made me feel alive again to see the setting sun, the sparkling water below us, the ferry building with its clock, the pyramid, and all the marvelous skyscrapers downtown. These things aren't new to me, but somehow they seemed more beautiful -yet so familiar- that day. I'm accustomed to riding on BART by myself, sitting next to a stranger, and looking at and reflecting weary expressions. From the last East Bay stop to the first SF stop, I don't say a word during the long pitch black ride. That sole excursion with XX lingers in my mind because of the achingly beautiful scenery, the effortless conversation, his company, and all the smiling and laughing.
