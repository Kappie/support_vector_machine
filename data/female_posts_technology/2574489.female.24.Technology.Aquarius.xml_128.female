So why did this weekend feel so short? Maybe I was having too much fun? Hmmm.....  Weekend Summary:   Lost $5 on a bet with T on what time our favorite Asian coffee place, Bethany Cafe, closes.  I hate being wrong....Grrrrr.....   Had a great work-out Saturday morning!   Indulged my cravings for Japanese food...California rolls, shrimp and veggie tempura, tepanyaki, miso soup...yum!   Browsed at Barnes and Noble, debated between The last Juror and Angels and Demons....settled for Angels and Demons   Watched Cold Creek Manor...and snored throughout the movie.   failed to wake up Sunday morning to work out...bad me....did not go to church for Palm Sunday...double bad   Had a great visit with my family....Dad's barbecue is the best!   Bought a  mababaw  book, a Danielle Steele paperback....I dunno, the first few lines were interesting.   I also read two blogs complaining about plagiarism.  Some even copying entries as if it was their own life events.  How sad.  This prompted me to disable right-click on my blog so as not to be able to view source code. Although, I'm first to say that this is a template...if you like the look of it, you may find it at Maystar Designs under Credits.  Please, though, don't copy personal entries as your own!  That's just....really pathetic.
