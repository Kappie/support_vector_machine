I will be sharing these posts with you on the upcoming posts.  I hope that you will enjoy and share the excitement that I felt as I embarked upon this new journey! :))     O, God, we ask you not to lift us out of life, but to prove your power within it;  not for tasks more suited to our strength, but for strength more suited to our tasks . Give us the vision that moves, the strength that endures, the grace of Jesus Christ, who wore our flesh like a monarch's robe, and walked our earthly life like a conqueror in triumph; we ask it for his sake.  Amen.  -- William Edwin Orchard (1877-1955) Wow!!  I have a lot of tasks which often demonstrates my strength but perhaps my strength is actually that I have the ability to do so many tasks?  Very interesting.  I'm excited about the upcoming trip and look forward to the tasks ahead of me - both during the trip and afterwards.  I have lots of ideas and ambitions to do while I am there.  I wonder if my thoughts will drastically be forever changed during the trip... "Every oak tree started out as a couple of nuts who stood their ground.  - Anonymous  "A visionary is one who can find his way by moonlight, and see the dawn before the rest fo the world."  - Oscar Wilde I consider myself a visionary in many aspects with many hopes and dreams and ideas to achieve my goals I set forth.  Sometimes though it seems that "getting there" can be an upward battle with never ceasing hurdles  challenges to overcome, all the while knowing that God remains by my side.  I know too that my hardships will be greatly minimized in comparison to what the Guatemalans are dealing with on a day to day basis.  I am wondering what new visions will find there  what impact that will have on my life...I wonder...In the meantime, my cousin remains at the hospital in critical care.  I hope God is hearing our prayers.
