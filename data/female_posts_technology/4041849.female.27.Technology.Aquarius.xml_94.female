EVER. i think my dream job would be not to have to work at all. my dream job is to be a lady of leisure. hehehe. when i first got out of college and first started working, i thought that it would be SO weird if i didn't work and i thought that even if i didn't need the money, i would continue to work. i know i've only been working full-time for about 5 years now, but it feels like 10. i swear i age twice as fast now than i did when i was in school.... ahhh, so why don't you go back to school, you ask? i couldn't handle anymore homework or tests. hehe... basically, i'm lazy.       well, i think i would feel bad if i didn't work at all ever again cuz i wouldn't want steve to have the full burden of supporting me... and i'd feel guilty... maybe i could work part-time. hehe... i don't think i'd hate my job so much if i could just work part-time. like, show up for the first and last weeks of every month. or even if i just got every wednesday off or something. i'd even settle for that. i wish they'd give us an option to work 10 hour days, 4 days a week. that would be nice. and it's not my boss. i mean, he makes my job tolerable. i think it's just the thought of working for The Man.       i really should do something about that... but, what????
