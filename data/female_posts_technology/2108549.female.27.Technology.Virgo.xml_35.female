I have a lot of ideas and little money.  And for once, that's ok.  This gets to be an ongoing project and that sort of makes it fun.  My only real have to have item right now is curtains and blinds.  The rest will come together with time.  Ju and I went and looked at it again last night and I still love it.  It just has a warm feeling when I look at it.  I can't wait to move in. Only 3 more days before I have keys and less than a week from now, I'll be moved in.
