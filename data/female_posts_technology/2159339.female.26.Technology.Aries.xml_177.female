They should only come in the colors pink, sea green, and canary yellow. They should have sparkles and bedazzles to simulate sprinkles, and polka dots that evoke maraschino cherries. If everyone had shoes that transformed their feet into cupcakes then wars would end and world peace would begin. Neon colored jellies are back as are big floppy bows that are both ridiculous and ubiquitous. We are entering a shoe renaissance as they're becoming twee whimsical confections that come in all colors of the ice cream rainbow. People, we must wear these shoes while we can, before our children make fun of us for once having cupcake feet.
