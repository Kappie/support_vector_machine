It is perhaps that I told Linda my tiny secret that I am very tight these days. Well, I tot she could have sympathised me a bit and say something nice by comforting me...Instead, I got a "scolding" from her. I was rather upset by the fact.  I have overspent for the past months, and the fact that my company expenses have not been reimbursed to my bank account isn't that helpful. My pitiful plight just reveals how dependent I am on my current job to sustain my living. :(
