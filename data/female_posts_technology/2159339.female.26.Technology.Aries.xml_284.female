The first band  urlLink The Blood Arm  was lame. They sound very "now" but instead of influences like Television or Gang of Four, their influences are The Strokes' "Is This It" and The Strokes' "Room on Fire". The lead singer does a convincing impression of Julian Casablancas in vocal delivery, but he's no Julian because he definitely is not the offspring of a Nordic beauty queen and a modeling mogul: rather, he looks like a warthog. Like "Pumba" from The Lion King. R-guy was less scathingly mean: "He looks like Tattoo."  Another "now" element they incorporated that irked me was their basslessness. Where was their bass? Seeing a new band with no bass is no longer shocking, but annoying in its ubiquity. I don't care how long this band's been around. They sound like they were born yesterday and are hence, doubly derivative. They're derivative of derivatives. What's the pride in that? Where's the originality? The guitarist strapped his guitar high, a la Albert Hammond Jr. and they were uniformly clad in blazers over t-shirts and skinny pants. Blah. They're unoriginal Johnny-come-latelys.   The next band  urlLink Sons And Daughters  I really liked. They're from Glasgow, Scotland, but they make very American sounding music. Like edgy bluegrass. Like a plugged in Gillian Welch on strong coffee. Like a ramblin Lucinda Williams with optimism and an agenda. I enjoyed their set very much and I want to see them again. Compelling. Dynamic. Whereas The Blood Arm seemed like poseury hacks, Sons and Daughters played interesting thoughtful music and performed like they believed in it. 2 guys, 2 girls and cute, to boot. They're a class act.   Franz Ferdinand are the new Duran Duran. Dapper dudes who make rockin swanky dance music. There were so many baby-cheeked little high schoolers in the crowd. I felt like a chaperone at a school dance. I looked for a punchbowl to stand by. Franz Ferdinand played great and, except for the dazed bassist, have incredible energy. They demonstrate that it's possible to shake your booty and play guitar at the same time. We got as close to the stage as the excited teenage girls would let us, but towards the end the heat was exhaustive so we exited the pit and watched from the balcony. I highly recommend their album. It's punchy and full of danceable hooks. The show was terrific, but I'm too old for the audience frenzy and hyperactivity and muggy-school-dance-in-the-gym-sweaty-sold-outted-ness of Franz Ferdinand.
