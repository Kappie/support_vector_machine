Surely the axis is spinning faster, everyone says so.  My boss was recently on a jury for a murder trial, she said it was a life-changing experience for her, she said that she knew the jury had made the right decision because she slept very well on the night of the verdict.  I think so too.   However, while she was on the jury listening to evidence, it occurred to her that some people have no concept of time. She realised that the value of an hour, a minute, a day is different to different people.  She said that to us, meaning her and me, the value of an hour is very different than to, say, someone who is looking after a child, or someone who does not have the constraints of a structured day to deal with ie. a drug addict.  Or, indeed, a murderer.  And it made me think, so does the day go quicker or slower for them?  An hour used to be so long, but now, it seems an hour is the new five minutes. An hour late is an acceptable time to arrive at a party now, isn't it? An hour TV show isn't even an hour anymore, not even on SBS or the ABC! And who has a full hour for lunch during the day anymore?   Consequently I can't help feeling slightly resentful about the hour that has been taken from me by daylight saving. I know that I will get it back sometime in March next year, however, I could have used it today, if only for a bit more sleep. Would that be a waste though?   Which begs the question, if I had more hours, what would I do with them?   What would you do with the hours?
