All proceeds from the single will go to benefit the Red Sox Foundation. Here's a recap of the history behind the song: Dropkick Murphys and the Boston Red Sox have given a modern treatment to “Tessie.”   The song — originally a Broadway hit — became the anthem for a growing band of Boston diehards known as the Royal Rooters and helped spur the Red Sox (then known as the Boston Pilgrims) on to a dramatic come-from-behind victory in the first World Series in 1903.   The cover art can be found on Epitaph's website. You can now view a video for the song that the band recently shot at Fenway Park:   Low- http://www.epitaph.com/_lib/streamvideo.php?id=4835=lo    High-  http://www.epitaph.com/_lib/streamvideo.php?id=4835=hi     Via  punknews.org
