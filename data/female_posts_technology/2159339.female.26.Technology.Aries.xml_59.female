Sure there were a lot of mange-y stanky underage punks, but the music was real good. There was a band called the (No) Apologies Project that is that punchy NYC art-funk-punk that I like. They all dressed in black with matching white belts and shouted out lyrics like, "Hey you've got the look!/ But have you read a book?" I was creaming my pants. I bought their CD, and I glued it into my stereo. I will never listen to anything else ever again.  After the show, I invited XX into my room under the guise of watching a Radiohead video, but we never got around to that. We hung out by my heater and listened to CDs. Here's the soundtrack to our platonic hanging out: (No) Apologies Project, Edith Piaf, Ministry, and The Beatles White Album. We were both lying down, and I made my move: I snuggled in close to him. He put his arms around me. We lay like that for a long time, just talking and making jokes and keeping each other close and warm. Then he started looking at me in that way of I-want-to-kiss-you. I looked at the ceiling and avoided his gaze. I wasn't being coy, I just didn't want to be mistaken.   Then after a while he said, "I want to kiss you, but I don't want to be thrown out." And I said, "I want to kiss you, but I don't want you to punch me in the eye." We smiled at each other then started kissing. It was nice. It was very very nice. It was so nice in fact, that I had the hugest internal boner I have ever had. I rubbed my crotch against him in a grinding manner. I kissed him some more. He whispered, " I can't believe we're doing this. I've had the biggest crush on you for so long. But I'm sure you knew that. " We kissed some more. My boner was getting so fucking hard and big that I thought I was going to implode. I had to do something. So I paused from kissing, and asked him softly, "Do you want to have sex?" He said yes, so we went to my bed and took off each other's clothes and boned like bunnies.   Afterwards when he was holding me he said, "I can't believe what just happened. I didn't even think you liked me that way." And I looked at him and said, "XX, I think I'm in love with you." And he was really taken aback. He said, "Well, I think about you a lot." That was kind of anti-climactic, but hey, whatever, I'll take what I can get. I kissed him and kissed him while caressing and fondling his dick until it was hard again, then I fucked his brains out.   Now that I've had him and etched a mark into my bedpost, what will become of us? What will become of me? Will my fantasies cease and my libido diminish until I'm as dry as a desert? What happens when the object of your lust finally comes into your bed and makes love to you until you almost can't take it anymore? What happens when the man of your sexual desires steps out of your head and makes you come and come and come and makes you love your body and love his body and fucking love life and love being alive? What happens then? What happens after this?
