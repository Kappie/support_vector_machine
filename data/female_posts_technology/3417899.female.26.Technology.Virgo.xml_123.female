       
      Traveling on a weekend is like    Having to do your homework on your birthday   Having to go to to a family dinner on the same night you've been asked on a hot date   Having to wear a tight, sexy dress when you're having your period and all you want to wear is sweat pants    Having to be a grown up, when, deep inside - you wish you were still a kid.
