I've been spending an inordinate amount of time reading blogs lately and I've discovered that my fascination for minutiae is insatiable.   But I particularly love the detail about what people eat and when.  Being such a stickler for routine myself,  I think that basically I'm living vicariously when I read about people eating all sorts of things at all sorts of times.    Wacky young people living on the edge, eating chocolate and fried things at all hours,  keep it up! An old woman depends on you for entertainment, you know.  I know why I love reading about the small things, because the older you get the more you realise that's what life is.  It's the succession of small things, some good, some bad all come together to make the big picture.   Life - it's just like knitting, really.
