Here's the bad (and remember, this is only bad from my perspective at this point, so I'm not talking global 'bad', this is just 'bad right now, for me')   - I've stayed at the same weight for the past 11 weeks (okay, for me this is bad, as I'm attempting to persevere with losing weight, and this is beginning to become less of a plateau and more ofa giant fucking Mongolian steppe and frankly, it's giving me the shits. Don't even get me started with the whole weight loss 'tips and tricks' for getting off a plateau because if I read one more time that I have to 'vary my exercise routine' or 'persist with patience', I swear I'll get out anOuzi and open fire)   - All the nice people at work are leaving, which makes me very sad because soon, the only people who are going to be left are a bunch of freakish self-serving managers and clearly, unemployable, me and that frightens me quite a lot   - While we're on the subject, well, work - work is bad, I'm sick of it. I'm over it. I want to win a billion dollars in Lotto and go work in a shop for 2 hours a day selling things to people they actually want and like   - My sleep pattern is shot to shit and I keep waking up every half hour after consistently strange dreams involving trips to Spotlight wearing unusual sneakers   Right, that's enough of that, here's the good;   - Chocolate Le Rice  - my new MP3 player  - I have a job, don't I?  - I am healthy, aren't I?  - I'm not defined by my work, am I?   So quit complaining, right?   Right.  I'm going to have my fake white hot chocolate now.  Right.
