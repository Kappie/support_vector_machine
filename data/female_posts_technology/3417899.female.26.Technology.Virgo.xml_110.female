This latest "merged" show is  urlLink Studio 7 . A combination of a trivita type show (general knowledge questions, IQ tests, etc) and a big brother (contenstants live together, form alliances, etc). Not bad at all.  And here I was, thinking I was weaned off reality TV. It's hard to be a recovering Reality TV show addict in the USA.   P.S. And you probably thought this post would be about sexual temptations, right? Not this time :-)
