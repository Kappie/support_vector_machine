In the spirit of the season, my family is driving me crazy (actual quote from my grandmother: "well, your mother bought two pies, and I bought two pies, so we have an awful lot of pie, I'm going to have some pie, wouldn't you like some pie?"  ARGGH!! )  Of course, my irritability could be due to the cold I've come down with.  (hmm, ending with a preposition, that's bad..."the cold with which I've come down"?  nope, same problem..."the cold, down with which I've come"?  now that's just silly.  Oh well)  My symptoms are runny nose, sore throat, headache, and a unique emotional state that made me be simultaneously hugely annoyed and nearly moved to tears by the movie Elf.  
 Now I face the challenge of getting some homework done in a house with DSL, tons of reading material, and TV.  Later I'll be going out with a dear friend who's also in town for Thanksgiving and doing some post-family get together detox.
