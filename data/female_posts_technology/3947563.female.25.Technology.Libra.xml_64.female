Eat fairly well except for the new york fries that I HAD to have!  For dinner I had roast beef and veggies.  On Sunday I cleaned the house from top to bottom and went roller blading for two hours.  I did have a hot dog and ice cream though!   I'm thinking along the same lines as Heather...if I want to met my goals I need step it up a little bit.  I feel on average the way I have been eating has improved.  I'm really starting to eat a heathly diet.  Keep in mind I need to have icecream and hot dogs once and a while otherwise I will go insane!  I'd like to work out more than I do.  I got my four work outs in last week and I'll try for that again this week.
