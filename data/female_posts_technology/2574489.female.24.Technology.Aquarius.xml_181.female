My husband does a lot of his share: cutting up my food into manageable size (like I was a kid), kisses me before he leaves for work,leaves me love notes and checks on me throughout the day. Too many to count!   What's the nicest thing you've done for someone else? I've bought food for colleagues as a treat, I guess.   What one thing do you wish you had done?  I wish I had gone backpacking through Europe during my college days, like my aunt had suggested I do.   What is your biggest regret?   Regret is something I don't allow in myself. I look back and am pretty satisfied with my past decisions and actions and those minor things that didn't go so well, I believe they were opportunities for me to learn.   What is your greatest accomplishment?   Graduating from college magna cum laude!
