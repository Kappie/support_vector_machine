After all - a "smart girl like me" should finish her degree, right? Especially after having already invested 2 years fo hard work, right?  "This will be so easy for you", "you were such a good student", "you got the highest grades without even trying"...  Well, the cost was not just $680.  It was the tryig to focus on academic material at the end of a work day and the inadequacy of not being able to concetrate or understand the exercises. It was the disappointment in my husband's tone when he ended up doing the exercises for me.   I woke up in the morning with a leaden feeling and went to sleep with it at night - knowing the exercise is late (there's a word for it in Hebrew : מועקה that can't really be translated properly to English).   So to make a long stroy short. I QUJIT.  I dropped out. I failed. I gave up.   Do I feel bad?  I disappointed my parents, my sister, my brother, most of my friends, my husband...  I should feel like a failure.   But all I feel is.. relief. RELIEF!!!!!!!!!!
