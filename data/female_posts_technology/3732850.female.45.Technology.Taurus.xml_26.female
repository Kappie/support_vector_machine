I was raised by a single Mom who wanted nothing but the best for me but at times, let her own needs and emotions overshadow being a parent.   As a child, I remember my mother always being either really "up" or really "down". It seemed like there was no inbetween. My mother worked two jobs to support us and "wanted" everything to be perfect for us. I think that was maybe part of the problem. Her idea of perfect and my idea of perfect were not the same. What things looked like on the "outside" was very important to my mother and still is.I was dressed well,I lived in a good home in a good neighborhood andI went to good schools. I know that there were times when my mother could not afford to dress me in the best clothes or send me to summer camps, but she managed to do it anyway. The sad part about it was that it meant she was working all that much more. She was not at home withme. In the evenings when I needed her for homework, she was working. When I needed her just to listen to what was on my mind, she was working. When I just needed a hug, she was working.   I know now that this was probably her way of showing her love for me and that she was probably avoiding feeling lonely, but it was not until I became an adult and had a family of my own that I realizedit. I can remember getting so angry because I was tired of taking care of my brother and sister all the time. I would be in charge while my mom was away, which seemed like all the time, and then whenshe would get home, everything was turned upside down.I liked the house to be just so and mymom didn't care. I cooked meals at certain times and my mom would sometime forget about meals.  Throughout those years, I continued to make mental notes as to what I would and wouldn't do as a parent. Of course,being a parentis not as easy as I thought it was when I was a child. I have been so fortunate. I was able to stay at home with my childrenwhen they were young. I have been able to be there for them in the evenings tohelp them with their homework and have supper cooked so that we can sit down as a family almost every evening. I have been able to be there when my kids needed hug or just someone to talk to but most of all, Ihave realized that I could not have done it without my husband of 25 years.  I cannot imagine raising a family as a single parent. I now appreciate the sacrifices my mother made in order to provide us with what she thought we needed. Maybe she just couldn't be there emotionally for us then, but she did the best she could. I have since gotten over my resentment and anger for having to be the "mom" at home when I was young, but I realize now, that what my mom did was make me a better parent for my children. Thank you mom.
