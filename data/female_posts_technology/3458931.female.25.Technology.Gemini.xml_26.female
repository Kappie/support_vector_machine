Jerk.  I told him I don't really want to maintain contact after we've swapped these posessions, he didn't seem to like that idea. I'm sure he'd like to be able to be friends and hang out and have conversations like we used to, but that's not my bag.   This person that he suddenly wants to become has a lot to do with the people he's started to associate with at work; they've finally started to assimilate him. M works at a call center and most of the people in this peer group are young singles. So now he's giving up classical piano and starting to "run" in the mornings; can anyone say desperate grab at youth? I don't want anything to do with someone leading such a shallow lifestyle, and I don't want to be the one he turns to when he wants to have a meaninful and intelligent conversation. Sorry boy; you lay down with dogs, you get up with fleas.
