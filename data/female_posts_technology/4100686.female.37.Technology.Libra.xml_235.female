They come in all shapes and sizes And spawn like fish or more like rabbits.  What is a reader to do Oh no, oh no. Too many blogs to read Keep clicking toe and froe  Don’t worry, don’t worry I say For Iraq blog count is here to stay.  We will count them Analyze them Put them into perspective And humerize them.  Anyway, all the blogs say the same. Electricity, on and off Today and yesterday.  It is too hot in Baghdad Too hot in Basrah It is too hot in Mosul Even in Hathra  We will summarize Report on new updates Make you feel all good With pictures of fuzzies  Oh no, Oh no, you say I can’t catch up when the Jarrars start to play.  Don’t worry, don’t worry, I know it’s not funny ihath has kids And read Dr. Suess, one time too many
