Here are my findings:  Wednesday 01-28  Yellow Press/ Fiery Furnaces/ Ted Leo @ BOTH    YP : I wasn't paying attention.    Fiery Furnaces : I liked the basic song structures and the tinkly piano, but Eleanor's voice was weak. She was a poor man's Janis Joplin. She had the conviction, the lyrics, the melodies, and the phrasings, but lacked the howl and growl of a true blueswoman. There was also a  majorly annoying, cacophonous electronic keyboardist to the right of the stage who'd ruin the songs with his awful blasts of noisy crap. R-guy liked them though,  and bought their CD. Were we at the same show?   Ted Leo : Good songs, devoted fans. This guy can fucking sweat! He wore a black button-down shirt which was soaked through with the buckets of perspiration careening out of his pores. I would not want to have sex with him. To the right, was a cute bass-player. He was very young, maybe 20, and he looked like a mini-Stroke. Cool style, cool poufy hair, like a cleaner-cut Albert Hammond, Jr.... But was he so clean? R-guy's friend noted that he was tweaked out on cocaine. He looked fine to me. But then again, the only symptoms I can register of coke usage is incessant meaningless chatter, and one's inattention to one's own frizzed out messy hair, and/or inadvertently undone shoe straps while one is dancing in a swaying a-rhythmic non-style.   Thursday 01-29  BartD/ Duvall/ The Cuts @ Cafe du Nord    BartD.  -- see review from previous post.   Duvall  -- This is Josh from Smoking Popes. Now he's in a trio without his brothers. If you liked The S-Popes, then you will like this. The songs are the same, but less frenzied and frenetic. Less punk, more post-punk, if you understand that at all. Same lyrical content -- simple ditties about love and longing, same tuneful poppy melodies, and same careful slightly nasal Morrisey-like singing. Last time I saw Josh was at a Smoking Popes show a decade ago and I remember he was thin with a shaved head and upturned impish nose (like the Quentin Blake illustration of a witch in Roald Dahl's "The Witches"). Now he's older, a bit heavier, and with hair. Same nose, though.  The drummer was a big fat fuck. He was probably one of those twins on motorcycles in The Guinness Book of World Records. He was huge, and he had a full beard. He was a sight for sore eyes because indie shows are populated with wan skeletal boys. This drummer was a man. In fact, I think he was two men.   Friday 01-30  Mellodrone/ Metric/ South @ Slim's    Mellodrone  -- missed him because my disco nap took on a life of its own. ( I was late.)   Metric  -- Female-fronted poppy new wave band. She looks like Winona Ryder with a touch of Famke Janssen. Classically pretty, high cheekbones, but small and pixie-ish. Aesthetically, the band reminded me of No Doubt. Older funky guys with weird hair who need their share of attention, but they ain't gettin any! The focus is all on the girl. Musically, the singing and phrasing is like Catatonia -- girlish, pure, and cute, with but not in a cloying way like Letters to Cleo. The girl plays synth keyboards and dances around to songs such as "Dead Disco" and "Combat Baby", two particularly bouncy tunes. They're like The Sounds, but not as blatantly 80s, but also less anthemically addictive. Metric is a little bit The Sounds, a little bit Bis, a little Komeda, and a lot Catatonia.  Audience complaint: I counted four baseball caps (actual sports logos, not trucker caps), two of them backwards! It was a people stew of middle-of-the-road sensibilities. There was a lack of eye candy. It was the opposite. XX calls it "eye garlic."   I attribute my audience complaint to the headlining band,  South . They are middle-of-the-road blokes from England. Their songs are melodic and uplifting and pretty and they sound much like another melodic, uplifting, and pretty middle-of-the-road band from England: Coldplay. The lead singer of South even looks like Chris Martin in that shaggy unshaved college boy t-shirt-and-khakis way. There is nothing wrong with this. It's just not for me. If you adore Coldplay, you will adore South. I don't adore Coldplay, so I think South is just okay.   Saturday 1/31  Elio Estevez/ Dynasty Handbag/ Coachwhips/ Numbers    Elio  -- Is Elio the guy in The Evening with the diabolical kidnap-the-girl-then-tie-her-to-the-railroad-tracks moustache? Are they one and the same? They had the same cookie duster, that's for sure. Elio is electroclash. One artfuck performer and his computer. He was wearing leather bondage pants with crisscross ties all up the sides. He was entertaining in that artfuck performance art kind of way.   Dynasty Handbag  -- Another electroclash artfuck. I don't hate electroclash. I love Tracy  the Plastics, Peaches, and Chicks on Speed, but there are just some bandwagoneers who are mediocre. Musically, that is. Her performance was entertaining: it's one girl and her computer and she came on with big early-90s teased hair, Yoko Ono wraparound sunglasses, a black ill-fitting baggy tent dress, and sandal flats with gold links and beads as the thong part. Very "Ban de Soleil", very ironic. Also ironic was the purse she wore the entire time, as part of her ensemble: it was one of those 80s Chanel knockoffs -- a black quilted rectangle with a long gold chain as the strap which she wore diagonally, artillery style. She was alright, music not tight, so I said goodnight. A couple days later I saw a review of Dynasty Handbag's record in Venus magazine, and on the cover of the album were 3 girls. Where were the other two on Saturday? I want my $$'s worth!     Coachwhips  -- They were excellent, as always. They played on the floor in the audience, as they always do, which sucks now because as they gain popularity, there are more dumb boys recklessly crashing into each other than fancy ladies dancing hard. The show was sold out, so that added to the chaos -- the packed crowd and the non-space to non-dance. Their set was too short and I regret that they didn't have any CDs to sell at the merch table. They were tasty and satisfying!   Numbers  -- They're hot with the hipsters and it was their record release. I wanted very badly to like them, but I was falling asleep! The music was loud and blaring within the confines of the squished club, but they didn't move my body the way The Coachwhips did. I wanted to like them because they're influenced by Gang of Four, but just because a band likes Gang of Four doesn't guarantee booty-shaking funk-nastiness. After the first song, which was pretty good, the rest of their songs sounded the same, with the same rhythms and drum patterns so this created a lulling effect for sleepy Batty. Batty want to say "nightie." Batty broke her all-time record of show-going: 5 shows, 5 days. Batty will never do this again... not for a long while, anyway... ZZZzzzzzzzzz.
