However, now that my daughter is back home with me and she has a computer of her own, it is now necessary to consider the wireless option because  she will be starting school next week  (  urlLink Time Warner  was going to charge me double for adding another modem to the account, or only $15 more for getting a wireless router, not to mention that they couldn't install it for another 3 weeks with the back to schoolers already lined up )  and we live in an apartment  ( no need to have wires being strung throughout the house to get us hooked up unnecessarily !)....They have asked me to bring in my old modem (which I have only had for a couple of months) to exchange it for the wireless router and equipment; I am wondering why though, because one would still need a modem, unless they had a gateway (including the modem with the router).  Well, I'll see in a little bit....  If you don't see me back on line posting my daily postings, you can probably be assured that the wireless set up that they are giving me today is not working right.  They  say  that it is pretty much plug and play.... we'll see how accurate that is!!    Wish me luck . . . :)
