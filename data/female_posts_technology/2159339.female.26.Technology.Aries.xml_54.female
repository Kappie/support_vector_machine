           
       ***   WPC   You're so shy and unassuming and with every blink I want to die... the mere turn of your head syncopates my pulse... If I can't do mundane things with you, I don't know what I'll do at all.  My life, my death, my love, my fate... I recognize myself in the loping bass notes from your mouth like an inverse black hole everything I've ever wanted to know comes out like stars but slow and with time... and when I seal your mouth with mine,  I swallow down what you are, and Fireworks go off inside me, beautiful and contained.
