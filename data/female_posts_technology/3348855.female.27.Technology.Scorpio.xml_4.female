    
       With my back to the wall the wind in my hair I stand poised, about to take off into the open wide skies  Some exhilaration, a little trepidation my mind is made, a chance I'll take - just to find out what it will be like  It is his voice, barely a whisper, that calls my name - I stop to consider.  The view is nice, from this ledge on the twenty fourth floor of IDX tower, I'll step away for now - however.
