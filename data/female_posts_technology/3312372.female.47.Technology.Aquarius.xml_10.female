I hope my doctor feels the same way when I see him on the 24th. Well I don't want to be to boring just venting. I'm having a rather boring evening. My boyfriend of seven years and I are finally seem to be coming to and end. We don't have anything to say to each other anymore. So he left early and here I sit. I've tried to love him all these years in hopes he would love me back the same. But unfortunately that dosen't seem to be something that will ever happen. So I'm exhausted trying to make the realationship work. So I guess we're fading away. Oh well life goes on. Thank god I can take care of my self :)
