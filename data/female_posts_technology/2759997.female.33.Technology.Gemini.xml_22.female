       
      So I added comments and trackback yesterday and somehow lost all of my template edits from Friday.  Then I post this morning and lose the work I did yesterday.  I've added back the comments and changed the style sheet info and I'm waiting for the next thing to go wrong.  Or revert back to a previous state.    Good thing this doesn't happen in real life.  Or does it?
