There's a  Kokeshi Dolls  exhibit at the Grand Atrium Shangri-La Plaza Mall from March 05 to 26.  It's open to everyone so go visit.   Maid in Manhattan  starring Jennifer Lopez and Ralph Fiennes starts regular showing today.  Today is  Ash Wednesday    Page One , the bookstore in Rockwell is now called  Fully Booked .   7th Day  will have an exhibit at  Encomium Cafe  on March 8.  The cafe is located at FBR Arcade, Katipunan.  I'm back to being just me last February 25.
