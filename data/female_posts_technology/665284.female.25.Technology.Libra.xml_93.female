Ako ay isang Dukha until elevated to Maharlika status come payday.  Yeneway, ako ay napagod at nasiyahan.  Napagod dahil sa hagdan na inakyatan at binabaan sa cathedral, Lourdes Grotto, Bell Church etc, at sa paghahanap ng hairpin halos isang oras mula 8:30  ng gabi dahil na-lock ang pinto ng kwarto namin.  We went here and there just to find a hairpin at the suggestion of my friend S.  Baka daw God will bless us for attempting to pick the lock and thereby ensuring our entry in the Thieve's  Guild.  Si J naman ay sobrang worry kasi sya ang last touch sa doorknob.  Ako at si N ay sunod lang and trying to insert a calmness to the situation by asking how long will the hunt for the "one" hairpin that will end our troubles going to last. Finding no hairpin, we proceeded to buy toothbrush and mineral water at 7/11 and had dinner at Jollibee.  Natulog na lang kaming 3 babae sa kwarto ng aming bading na kasama while he went to Gimbals and Alfonso(ata) to drink  blessed beer with his friend S.  We were able to open the window of our bedroom at about 8 in the morning using the DSL brochure.  Yehey!  Nasiyahan because we were able to commune with nature sa Botanical Garden, Mine's View, Wright Park, Camp John Hay.  I was seriously expecting the traditional christmas tree pine tree pero wala akong nakita.  Dahil marami kaming pictures.  I have doubts about how I look in them though.  My hair is probably sticking out in different directions.  Dear, there goes my cute picture.  Ipo-post ko pa naman dito sa Friendster.  And syempre best of all I was able  to buy chocolate mallows, peanut brittle, chocolate and milk flakes, sundot kulangot, choco crinkles, legua de gato and ube jam for me and my  family!  Ube jam with coffee.  Makes sense to me.
