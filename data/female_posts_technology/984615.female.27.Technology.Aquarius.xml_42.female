Now I am scrambling to get all my Law school information in so that I can find an excuse to fuck around for the next several months.  But I'm still fucking out of work. I was supposed to be in portland today. I went a little apeshit at breakfast ranting about how this didn't feel right. I was up much too early and was pacing about the fact that I was not in portland. shit.   I suppose that after I've got all this other shit done I'll get started on looking for work. I think I'll be calling alot of my old clients...
