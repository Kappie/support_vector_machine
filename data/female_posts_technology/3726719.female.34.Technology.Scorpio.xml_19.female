It was awesome.   And a bit sad.  See, I love fireworks.  They are just so beautiful and amazing.  I absolutely adore the symphony.  The first cords I hear give me chills.   Combine the two, and it's heavenly.   The sad part of this evening was sitting in my car to watch and listen all by myself.  Of course, it's not as bad as sitting in the middle of a crowd all by myself.   My dream, hence my goal, is to be front and center next year.  Sitting on a cozy blanket, with a full picnic basket, a couple really good bottles of wine (or if in a public park and cooler jug full of some yummy adult beverage), and in the company of a man who adores me.....or at the very least in the company of some friends who enjoy fireworks as much as I do.  I love being an American.  I love living in the United States.  There is a church I pass everyday going to and from work.  The sign this week says "don't use your freedom as a rationale for sinning" and every time I see it, I want to change it to read "DO USE YOUR FREEDOM AS A RATIONALE FOR SINGING."   A much more appreciative sentiment in my opinion.  We Americans take so much for granted, and we have the freedom to do so.  We can say what we want, when we want to.  We can eat all the junk food we can stand.  A single woman can buy a house all by herself.  And we have so many occassions to celebrate - and we make up more every year!  Ya know, I think it would be cool to have a wedding on July 4th - I mean think about it, a pretty dress, cake, and fireworks....it's cool!  :O)  Anyway....I've had a basically uneventful weekend.  Missed the amusement of the roomie - he actually just got home early and I'm awaiting camping stories.  Rented a few movies - Paycheck, Cheaper By The Dozen, and Love Actually.  Love Actually rocks and I will be buying it for my personal collection!  Paycheck actually wasn't too bad.    I haven't done any stitching yet.  Worked on jigsaw puzzles.  Gonna get the stitching out tomorrow though.  I've got all week.  Have a great Monday tomorrow!  Hugs -  Mel
