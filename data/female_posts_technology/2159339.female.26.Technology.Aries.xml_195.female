But she worked her ass off, so she totally deserves this.   60% - Staring at the picture of Prince William in his water polo outfit. Goddammit he's hot. Too bad I already have a boyfriend. I'll be unattached in June, wait for me William!!  15% - Working on two proposals. My boss is out and by the time she finds out I've taken on responsibilities "outside of my job description", it will be too late to assign them to someone else. Ha! (I might really get fired for this, but I'm ok with that).  8% - Planning the "girls only" camping trip with some of the fabulously sassy ladies at my company/gossiping about the girls who are not invited because they're bitches.  2% - Coughing up some nasty shit. What is going on with my body? This is ridiculous. On Monday I'm getting a head scan at the Oakland Kaiser, maybe they'll figure out this freakin cough.
