All I can say is Peter, you're a dead-set legend.  I think it's fair to say also that I look so much better morphed into a creepy, cat-nosed person that I'm seriously considering surgery to make it a reality.  I've become more and more accepting of surgical enhancement lately and let's say I'm considering my options.  But I digress, well, actually I don't, because this is the point of a blog isn't it? Digression, discussion and narcissism - the blog is a forum for all these things, isn it?  And good heavens, I will certainly be taking advantage of it.
