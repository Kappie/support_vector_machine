Chatted with my family for a bit, saw the new kittens (only a week old) then went to bed.  Saturday was the Wilson picnic.  All my mom's aunts, uncles, and cousins get together every summer for a potluck picnic and games.  It was a beautiful day and a good turnout.  I even got a little sunburnt.  After the picnic we stopped by my grandparents house for a quick visit and so my grandma could give me my birthday present.  Then home again to relax.  On Sunday I went to my home or my parents' church, whichever you want to call it.  Some of my high school friends were there, but not too many since most are out on their own too.  After church we went over to my Opa's house for coffee and more visiting.  Then we piled in the car and drove to Belleville for one of my cousin's baby shower.  We had a BBQ and cake and all kinds of goodies.  I also got to catch up with more family.  After the shower we drove back to Bowmanville where we had left my car and I headed back to Grand Rapids, and my parents and Opa headed home.    From the Fifth Wheel truck stop, I set out on 6 hour drive home.  The drive was uneventful except for the usual traffic in Toronto and the major traffic at the border.  It took me about 45 minutes just to get across the bridge and up to the gate.  Needless to say, that set me back an hour, and I got home later than I expected.  But was I glad to be home.  I went almost immediately to bed, and had no troubles sleeping.
