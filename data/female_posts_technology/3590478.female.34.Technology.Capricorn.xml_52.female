Here’s a tip precious: If you’re wearing double layered sweat pants and have to cover yourself with a blanket just to watch TV, you’re  cold , not hot. The thermostat should be turned to the higher numbers, not the lower ones. And tip number two: Do not put me in complete charge of temperature control if what you really mean to do is put me in complete charge of temperature control until you are unsatisfied with the temperature. That is just cruel and it promotes a false sense of supervision.  Other than that though, I’m fine. I had a delightful weekend. Friday night I read a book and finally calmed down after my break in trauma. Saturday morning I had my best golf game to date. A 45 on the 9 hole crack course. 45 minutes of putting practice just might be the answer. Then I got to hear all about the exciting exploits of my, currently, favorite little monkey over lunch. In the evening I played drinking trivia where I learned many new and interesting facts. (Such as, in France a French kiss is called an English kiss. Ok, maybe what I meant to say was I learned many new and  drunken  facts.) I was supposed to watch the only episode of Buffy I’ve never seen but the power was out. Then I went to a Davy Jones concert. Poor Davy, more singing of the oldies please and less comedy stylings. Axel Rose totally stole his moves from Davy Jones. On Sunday I played golf again and didn’t do nearly as well as I did on Saturday but I didn’t care because it was so fun. Then, because it was raining (and, despite my firm statements of, “it’ll blow over any time now”, did not let up at all) I spent all afternoon and evening drinking beer and watching replay TV. I saw 3 Joan of Arcadias, an old Angel episode with Buffy and Faith (must’ve been sweeps), 3 rocked with Gina Gershon, a really bad Lebanese movie (and by really bad I mean Canadian), a worlds apart I’d never seen and the Whos Tommy.  Ann Margaret writhing around in baked beans still cracks me up. Ah Tommy, can you hear me indeed. One more thing, If any of you are offended that I use your real names when I post this crap, let me know and I will assign you a fake name. But don’t be all acting like you get to pick the fake name cause you don’t. (“hmmm, Maybe I should just let her use my real name, that seems less ominous.”)
