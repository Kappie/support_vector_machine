You laugh and you cry - just like them. But you know, you are different.  You know you feel things at a different level, can express yourself in a different way.  You know you can do this better, and that better, and this faster, and that clearer.  You think you have done more with less.  You think you could be what they never would be able to.  And you wonder - does everybody else feel the same way about themselves? Or is it really... REALLY... just you.
