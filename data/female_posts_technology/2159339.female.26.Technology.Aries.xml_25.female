You know what this means, right? Wedding bells. Ding dong, ding dong. I'll even invite my boyfriend. He can be my maid of honor.  On Sunday was my friend Alli G.'s birthday and she hosted a shrine-making party. Scattered throughout the floor of her living room were organized messes of beads, baubles, tchotchkes, trinkets, glitter, gems, trim, paints, brushes, and glues and adhesives. Of course, our favorite cancer-causing glue was present: the E6000. I was in heaven. Whether it was the toxic fumes in an enclosed area, or whether I was feeling a more organic euphoria, I do not care.   She gave each of us a mini plywood armoire to decorate, and it was fun. She is very much into Mexican folk-art, so all of our shrines had a Dia de los Muertos feel to them. I glued on the card of "El Corazon" to my door but inside I put up a picture of a pin-up girl. I painted the inside of my box to look like her girly boudoir of pink seduction. I was pleased because ever since I lost my nudie pen I've been kind of bereft. I didn't know what else I could bring in to work to combat the general blahness of working in a grey cube and doing grey work. My new lady will do just fine. But something was missing: she wasn't saucy enough for me. I opened and closed the door. She was not turning me on. As a final touch I decided to squeeze some red glitter glue onto her faint nipples. There! It was perfect. Titallatingly scandalous, pun intended.
