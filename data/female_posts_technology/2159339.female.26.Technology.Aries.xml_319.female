The room was freeezing, which made me shiver like a retard  made my nipples poke out, but I managed to articulate my unhappiness about the job and especially about the boss. It looks like I may be switching groups within the next few months. Yipee!! Still have to decide what sort of work I want to make into a career, but have some time for that. In addition, bonded with another unhappy camper in my group about our boss and feel much better knowing that it's not just me.  Lessons Learned Today: 1)Ignore mom and her peasant, appeasing ways and go for the gold. 2)Be nice to mom at the same time in case I get canned over causing drama and need a place to live. 3)Take only express busses in the morning.
