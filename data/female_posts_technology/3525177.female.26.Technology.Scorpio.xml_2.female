Sweet tea is a very personal thing for a southern person.  And so, it is for me as well.  The Yankee part of me still likes my tea good and strong.  It should be a strong brown color.  Like, you know... Tea.  As a southerner, I like it sweet - but not too sweet.    Now, all good southerners know you brew your tea hot and strong (condensed), put in a full cup of sugar.  Mix it in until it dissolves and then mix it with cold water and ice.  Some then set the tea in the sun.  Some add lemon.  Some add verbena.  Some mint.  It's a personal preference.   But I like a half cup of sugar instead of a full.  Which, in most southern eyes is a travesty - but hey - I'm still a Yankee in my bones.  And sometimes I go a little weird - I leave out the sugar all together and add rose water.  It's delicious and will settle an upset tummy. :)  Now - some restaurants do an excellent job of brewing tea.  It's brown, and sweet - but not colored sugar water.  And I'll usually order half sweet, half un-sweet at restaurants where the servers are extra nice - or if it is slow.  However, here, in the South - the capital of Sweet tea - there are those idiotic restaurants who will bring you - yellow tea.  Yellow tea is not tea- it doesn't look like tea - it doesn't taste like tea - it's colored water.  You might as well be serving water.  It's a travesty.    Then, there were the extra "special" (Special BUS!) servers in the Backyard burger drive-thru on Saturday.  They have good strong tea.  I get my tea - and I take a good swig and I thought I was going to hurl - it tasted alllllllllllll wrong.  I looked - the concoction was yellow!  Grrr....  Then, I realized: It's half tea - half lemonade.  WTF?     But at least then, It was palatable.    As everybody knows, when you take a swig of something and you realize it's not what you expected- it's really nasty - like drinking a coke only to realize it's your friend's Dr. Pepper.     Where am I going with this?  Nowhere - I'm rambling - I told you this would happen. (wink)  You  were  warned.   Arivederci, cutesox
