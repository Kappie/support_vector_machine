But as I am waiting to find out if Thomas is about to go into a real estate deal he doesn't want, or if he's just been swindled out of $10K by a crooked real estate agent, i just discovered something quite by accident (well, the search wasn't by accident, but actually finding something was) that absolutely floored me.  Nancy--Thomas' fiancee, who has told him she has three engagement rings prior--was divorced in Connecticutt in 2001. She was already involved with Thomas at the time.  Back in the days when Thomas used to talk to me, he only spoke of her previous engagements, and his reticence to become a fourth. He never mentioned a previous marraige, even when I asked him. That means he was lying to me back then (for what purpose?) or...he doesn't know.  More likely he does know and didn't want to tell a married woman that he had been involved with a married woman.  Perhaps he even caused the divorce.  That sure answers a lot of questions, doesn't it?  Total openness one day and the angry secrecy the next. Or even now within minutes.  I haven't seen Thomas now for three weeks. In two weeks, I may never see him again. He won't meet with me. And I cannot be president under those circumstances.  And he won't discuss it.  Of course, he is involved in what is sounding more and more like a shady real estate deal right now, which is a lot of pressure, I know, plus his car broke down earlier in the week and he's relying on Nancy for transportation, and he's been positively ghastly to deal with, so now is not the time to bring it up, so I stay silent. But now I know why he is buying the house (if he bought it) under his own name. Because he knows he is marrying a woman who cheated on her husband. Probably separated, though. Because he knows that the relationship is bad to begin with. Because he knows that 90% of all second marraiges fail. My heart aches for him.  It hurts, to lose this friend. It's an ache that won't go away. And now to know the truth--and to keep it silent--but still not know what any of it has to do with me, is agonizing. I know he is no saint. I know what he's done now. But I love him all the same. He rejects my offers of help on one hand and then turns to me for it with the other.   I really love this man, even though he has been nothing but horrible to me for almost six months now. He was wonderful. He earned my love.  Then inexplicably turned against me. With no feeling. With no mercy. Why should I love someone like that?  And worse--now I have to be president of the German School. and work closely with Thomas, which will be quite a trick for someone who won't even speak to me, who is someone who once pretended to love me for reasons that are also unknown to me.  Good God, Thomas. Talk to me. Have some mercy. I am not owed an explanation, but I am worthy of one. I have been a good friend to you. Why are you doing this to me?
