But they choose that, this time it isnt chosen.  It just happen to be that noone is here. But Brian and I had fun.  We even made cupcakes.  He is so sweet.  We snuzzled night before last, but now that I cant get my tv to turn on he wont snuzzle,  its pretty bad when the tv wins out over mommy  HA.     With my husband being gone, its hard to believe how much I love and miss him.  Its not that I did not know that I love him, but him being gone just makes me realize how much.  I never want to be without him.  I am doing as he made me promise and am not sleeping on the couch, but I take everyone of his pillows and surround me, they smell so much like him.  Damn I love that man so much.
