It's just that I have written some blah blah blah in here that I'm not sure I just want any Joe or Josephina to read. Or maybe it's not the Joe's or Josephina's I'm worried about. I guess maybe I need to take it semi public and make some online friends. Or is this just cheap therapy for me? Ionno...  Anywho, a lot had gone on since I last wrote. But like, it's all in my brain and I'm not sure how it will pour out on this "page." But here goes.  My eyes are green because I eat a lot of vegetables (and true Badu fans out there?) My coworker was talking about her impending marriage and her big ole townhouse and her big ole SUV that she is getting and her big ole profit off her condo and her big ole clean bill slate and her man that caters to her every whim and has a big ole...I'm taking it too far. But am I wrong to not really want to hear that shit. Like Vivica said in Two Can Play, you can't really truly be happy for the next bitch when your shit isn't correct...or something like that. It's not that I'm really even ready for all that. I enjoy hanging out at the bar getting drunk grooving to old school r with my gfs. Or downing a whole pitcher of magaritas with another gf and not have to worry about some pouting ass nigga wondering when I'm coming home. Can you enjoy your singleness and still want the security of a relationship? Ionno.  Okay, let's take it a step further. Then there's Koritha. Her ass was practically fucking random niggas bucked nekked and she gets to live rent free with what I'm assuming it a good ass niggra. Sigh. I kind feel like a class A biyotch for even saying this stuff. But heh, its my friggin blog. But uh...WHY?   Honestly, I go back and forth on whether I want a man right now anyway. I feel so jaded. I feel like I can't trust. I feel like I will be so suspecting of any suitor's motives that I will surely drive him away. I feel like why would he love me. Why wouldn't he? I'm a lot to put up with. Why should he? Why shouldn't he? Although my sex drive is pretty much at an all time low, I just today felt a tiny smidgon of really missing the touch and company of a man. Not so much the entrance of the schlong into my womb. But the conversation, the company...the excitement of knowing that it will happen. I miss dating. It's only been about 4 months, but I'm starting to feel it a bit.  On to this homebuying thing. I totally tripped on my new realtor, but she hung in there. I guess she really wants a sale. So I'm still in it for a minute.  I guess I'm enjoying my summer so far. I have a lot planned. I would like to go on a mini vacation. But honestly, I don't have the money...not until this homebuyig thing is settled. I can carely afford to do little things around here without scrimping for change at month's end. You know it's sad when you make like $10K more than some people but they always seem to have way more money than you. It's the American way. LOL!  Kay...gotta cut this short.
