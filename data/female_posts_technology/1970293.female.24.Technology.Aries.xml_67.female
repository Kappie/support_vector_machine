YOu should make friends and get out more."  Her mother had just started her tirade.  It was now safe to roam with her mind somewhere else where she can be alone in her own little world.  Everyone was eating happily as this was a daily occurence.  Her father was ignoring everything and her brother was imagining a war with his food.  Her mother is usually the only who speaks and only to remark on other's shortcomings.  Her father of course was a physist and her mother a genetist.  A completely normal family except for that fact that we lived on a space station.  It was considered the best place for experiments and raising families says the magazines of Earth.    Shari shook her brown hair back behind her ears again.  It was awful here.  There was never enough to do to keep her busy hence her interest in books.  Of course they expected her to become a doctor of some sorts hopefully of one of their professions.  She sighed again and moved her food around her plate.  She expected her brother had it the easist.  He had friends and after chores and classes they roamed throughout the space station on missions with their toy guns.  All she got was a robot to mind her and books.  At least the later kept her somewhat busy.    After dinner she crept back to her room to pick up her book before her parents found something for her to do.    "Shari."  Her mother called from the living room.  Shari changed her mind and ducked out of the family unit into one of the walkways on the space station.  She would just take a walk around just to see if anyone painted anything green or if there is a field of trees and birds.  Maybe even a castle from the days of old could pop up in the distance.
