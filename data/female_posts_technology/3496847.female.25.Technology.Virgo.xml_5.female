Soon the government of Canada will have a new make up - all the new and returning MPs will head to Parliament, to pick on each other. I don't like the Canadian government.  I don't like the provincial government (Ontario or Nova Scotia.)  But I do vote.  There is no way that I'm not going to have my say.  I won't let others speak for me.  **I can't let Stephen Harper be our next PM.  If he got in and I didn't vote, I'd have to emigrate.  I couldn't complain about him and admit that I didn't do my part to try and keep him out of power.**   Issues that are important to me:   Health care  - free national health care is great.  Taxing the crap out of us for it sucks (Dalton McGuinty - I'm talking to you.  How dare you take $25 dollars a month more from me - I just get by as it is.  Don't you make enough off the interest I pay on student loans?)  Our health care is part of what makes Canada great.  It's lacking dental care.  Teeth are an important part of overall health.  I've never understood why it's not subsidized like other health services.  And we need more rural doctors.  I lived most of my life in NS without a primary care physician.   Education  - tuition in Canada is too high, and financial aid is not the answer.  I have a degree, and poor parents, therefore I have $30 000 in student loans to pay back.  Education makes our country better, but debt is making me consider (seriously) leaving the country.  If I'm going to be broke, why not be broke in an interesting setting?  Taxes  - we have some of the highest taxes in the G7.  Is it really necessary?  Are our taxes going where they are needed and promised to be going?  See the sponsorship scandal.  Drive on the highways and pay for gas. ****** I've voted - now it's time to watch the returns (and bake cookies.)
