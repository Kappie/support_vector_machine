"Over halfway done!"  Unfortunately, this close to the end the rows just keep getting longer and longer and looooonnnnnggggeeeeeeeerrrrr.  I haven't figured out how many stitches will be in the last row, but I know it's a lot.  There's a lot on the needle now.  I think the 29" circ I'm using will be long enough for all the stitches though.  I'm going to change the color order a bit, so I can have more of that pretty pink/yellow mix that I mistakenly cast on with when my intention was to use it last.  See if I cast on another Charlotte when I'm overtired again.
