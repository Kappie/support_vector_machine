Guess it must have been the going home late, thus delaying sleeping times... Oh man! Really need to try to sleep by 11pm at least 3 times a week! Otherwise the energy level does dips straight down! This week is almost a spending week. Terrible! Spending too much money. A Mango denim skirt, a zara blouse, skirt from Esprit, lotsa little snacks and chocolates and expensive meals. Need to curb spending next week! I really need to get my tuition money this week! To top up for all I have spent on my shopping and food!  Gonna be heading down to the pool later! Its just gonna be a wonderful day! Nice tan! Swim!      SPLISH SPLASH!
