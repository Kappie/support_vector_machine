It would be interesting to see if it actually went for anything.  Wouldn't it be neat to have a real tardis to travel through space and time.  T.A.R.D.I.S stands for Time and Relative Dimensions in Space.  If I had one just like the Doctor's I would have to redecorate it.  Of course I would probably get lost in the many chambers it has.  Isn't it neat to daydream?
