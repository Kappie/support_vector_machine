It's a girl thing, right - we are socialized to look friendly and non-threatening. My April resolution is to stop doing it. We'll see how that goes.  In other news, I'm putting my shopping freeze on freeze as I've decided to get my very own IPod (with my tax return money). The toughest part is figuring out what to engrave on it.  Talked to grammy a few seconds ago. She's having her annual Passover dinner next week and wanted to make sure I can make it. I asked how she was feeling. She said she was getting ready for death, but now that my brother got into a good school, she's collected strength and has made a decision to live a bit longer. She asked me if I have a boyfriend and if he treats me well. The last thing she said was that I should trade time spent with friends for some ambition and drive. Oh, granny granny, how much I love you and how you drive me crazy.  Tonight Batty and I are checking out Nellie McKay at the Independent. She seems cooky and original. Should be an interesting show.
