Charles came over like 10 minutes after I got home without calling, empty handed except for the Sonic cup he was drinking (where the hell is mine). Aside from a hug and kiss when he came in (initiated by me of course), no other affection was shown and I really didn't know what the hell he was doing there.  He asked what I was doing and I said I had just got home and was watchingGreen Acres.Duh, I'mstill in a suit and the TV is on. He didn't say anything else so I went back to the couch and he followed, sitting a few feet away.  No hand holding, no kissing, nada. He would just ask every few minutes what I was doing. (Duh!!)  I finally asked why he was there and he said I had a bad day so he came over. (And???? Did he offer a massage, going out to dinner, anything????).  I was bored. I definitely wasn't going to entertain him. Apparetnly that's what's expected.  He fell asleep. I got up and did laundry and the dishes. him snoring the whole time.  I finally went over, kicked him awake and told him he needed to go.   Haven't heard anything. definitely not calling him. Will he contact me? Do I care?  Let the wagering begin!
