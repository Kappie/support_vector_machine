You inflate the top ring then fill 'er up.  It barely fits on our paved patio and gets sun for most of the day to heat up the water, and then it is shaded in the evenings.  The filter system is quite simplistic, but I honestly didn't expect much for $78.  It took us about an hour to set it up, and then about three hours to fill it with water from the hose.  I let it sit out in the open sun today and already the top of it has a layer of ickyness.  I guess we'll have to cover it up and keep it cold from now on.  We've been thinking about getting a jacuzzi/hot tub for our back yard.  Andrew and I went out to Paddock Pools to take at look at their Sundance spas yesterday.  They look nice, but if you actually climb into them you'll see that they are just not deep enough.  They also do not have enough room, or they have built-in seating that just doesn't feel comfortable.  Andrew is too tall, and I am too wide, to sit comfortably in any of the built-ins.  Also if you sit in the open circular spas, only one person's knees and feet will fit in the center.  How could it possibly seat 3-4 people?  Those marketing folks are seriously disturbed if they think these things seat 6-7 'comfortably'.  That's a crock if I ever did hear one.  I think we'll be passing on a spa for now.  They just don't seem to make sense.  Now if I could just get Andrew to install a ceiling fan in the kitchen, that would make things much more comfortable in the front of the house...  I'll work on it...
