If you are unaware of exact what it is the five nerves that run from your shoulder down to your fingers that do not function properly because of different problems. My daughter's nerves (3 of them) were severed and two were stretched when she was born. She was 11lbs and her shoulders ended up getting stuck. She stopped breathing so the doctor just pulled her out as it was either this or she would not be alive. She had surgery when she was 6 months old to repair the damaged nerves, but all of her motor function has not and will not return. She is doing great though. We use to go every year to see her doctor in Toronto, but two years ago he decided he was not going to do anymore surgery unless a new technology or something came about. So we are going every two years for assessments. He is a great doctor.   We are leaving on June 26 and returning on July4th, maybe earlier if we run out of money. The kids are excited and what to do everything well we are there. Go to Canada's Wonderland, the zoo, stop at Niagara falls, and go to maybe a water park or something. I just find everything so expensive there. Here it is free to do most things or it cost very little.   17 days.
