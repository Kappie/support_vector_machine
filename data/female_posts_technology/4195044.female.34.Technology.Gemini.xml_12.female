It was freaking 2AM when I drift off to bed. Dutchman didn't even noticed me!    At Work....      I am close to snapping at this  Fat Bitch  in the office, who can't seem to handle a decent conversation, even with my boss, her boss. Why does she have to scream her tonsils out into her brains in order to get a point across? Talk about harrassment! Nothing is ever good enough with her ONLY IF you first consult her timeless wisdom and discernment. Perhaps she is seething with boiling animosity that we now get to report to the same person!      Then the new toy, my  HP Pavilion ze551ea  is doing ' Fijn '.       By the way, ' Kut weer ' is back - rainshowers and a 19C temperature, supposedly for a nice summer day today.... BUT yesterday was 31C?  Wat is er aan de hand?  What did the Dutch do to deserve this kind of earthly punishment?
