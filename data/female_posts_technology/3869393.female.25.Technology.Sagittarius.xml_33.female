Happiness is something you design. The greatest source of unhappiness comes from inside.  Happiness is the art of learning how to get joy from your substance.   Lets take for example our relationships -   If your relationship doesn't have adestination, how will you know when and where you reach ?   Good relationships are no accident. Tough times can strike any relationship - family, professional or friendship. But deciding to be responsible and 'happy' in practical ways can result in relationships that are tougher than tough times.  Think about this. We see around many couples want to"fix" problems, but don't know how to reach it.  The most common and most fundamental thing these couples are lacking is the knowledge that - happy relationships is a decision. If you look at it from this perspective, you'd agree that love is not a feeling of a particular moment but it's a decision.  Love is waking up every day committed to honoring yourpartner for being with you. If you want to have a great relationship, it's up to you. If you want to be happy, it's up to you!
