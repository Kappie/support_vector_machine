Instead of parking my car, running in to grab a burrito, and speeding home to scarf it down (on my bed, of course), I satparked in front of Gordo's for 45 minutes listening to NPRcomentary and finally Barack Obama's speech, parts of which I literally cried through. The way I see it is this- if Bush wins for another four terrifying years, this will have been our closest moment to victory, so I better enjoy it while it lasts.
