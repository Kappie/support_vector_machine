I tryed other sports but this was my favorite and the one I enjoyed. One time I remember being the only one with a perfect serving record. My couch showed me the stats when were playing Adults against the eighth grade team. This sport is to be taken seriously with a couch or another way to see it is just to have fun out on the beach with friends in the warm sun. So this sport is an either/or situation. To have fun with it or to take it seriously. Whichever one to pick or choose, it is always a fun sport to me.
