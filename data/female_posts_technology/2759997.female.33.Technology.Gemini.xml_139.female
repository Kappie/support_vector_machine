Of course, most of you who have had this conversation with me know MY take...  I go for the traditional "number of words in the slogan" theory.  As opposed to the "year prohibition ended" theory.  And since this year I AM Rolling Rock (33).  I figure it's going to be a good year.  Some time soon.  :)
