In this neck of the woods, I wonder how many of us there are.  I think there are only a few people with money in this area and I wish I were one of them.   Someday, I hope to take a trip myself. This won't happen for a while because my youngest is three years old and i want to enjoy myself with hopefully someone special in my life by that time. Someday I hope to go to Hawaii. Someday could go on forever but I hope someday I will also win the lottery or go to the black hills.  That may be a goal i could start now. Someday, I would like to go on an airplane or the amtrak to montana where my niece lives. Someday, I hope they find a cure for cancer and other illnesses.  Sooner than later. Someday.
