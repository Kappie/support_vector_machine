Although I nearly slipped several times on my mat from sweating so damned much that I was dripping all over the place. But the best part was at the end when I got to literally sleep on the floor for another few minutes.   It finally came to a head - I HAD to go back to the gym...When I couldn't fit comfortably into my jeans and the flabby flop of flesh (say that fast ten times) had turned into folds of other unmentionable dimensions it was sad. Basically I'd put on about 20lbs since I had started work approximately 6 months ago at Morrison  Foerster in Palo Alto. drivng to and fro from san francisco and then stuffing my face with random junk foods because I didn't have enough time to cook or even spill a bowl of cereal down my shirt...well it added up. (especially around my waist)  regardless - it needed to be done. My knees were starting to seriously hurt from the pain of that extra 20lbs.
