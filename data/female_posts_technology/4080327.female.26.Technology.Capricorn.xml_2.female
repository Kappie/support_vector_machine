Walked to the dining room half-awake and finished my dinner. Came online and look at other bloggers' blog. And found that the name of my Blog - My Thoughts is kinda common. I mean, not that it is extremely special but I don't expect to see that many people using it.  Should I just change the name of my blog? Hrmmn ... was thinking of My Evil Thoughts. But I have nothing evil to write ... not that I am going to anyway. It will just spoil my image. hehe...  What about 'Thought of the Stone' or Stone's Thoughts? Since zirconia is a type of stone. There is link to me that way. Maybe, 'My Thoughts & Feelings' or 'My Space' . Gee, this is harder than I thought!  Any ideas?
