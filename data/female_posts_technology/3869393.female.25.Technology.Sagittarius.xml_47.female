Actually, most of this started off on Friday evening, when I kindof went into this lull and complete depression.  The birthday party brought back a whole lot of memories for me and that absolutely ripped thro' my soul, I could feel this agonizing pain run thro' my heart.  Friday evening, I needed a change desperately after the gloomy time I had at office, and headed to the beach for a walk.   Man, one weird thing, but somehow usually the beach tends to calm my nerves down and it did a good job, but the effects were only temporary.  I walked at the beach, one solid brisk walk for 30 minutes and then picked up my aunt and headed home.  Rest of the day was most uninteresting to say the least!  Saturday start was a touch dull and boring, but towards the afternoon the spice began.  No idea really what happend to me, all I do know ws that I was hit by a hurricane.  All the medicines which I had been consuming, with god only knows what else began to takes its toll on me.  It all started off with a headache, nagging one.  I thought okay, must be one of those pshyco things, picked up a few DVDs and headed back home.  Watched this movie called HUM TUM, hindi movie, which if literally translated means, We U...!  The movie was one really good one, and personally enjoyed it, due to two reasons, It gave me some relief from my thinking mode and two, It re instilled by faith that our life is a long one, one never knows when and where their paths with cross and with whom, the uncertainity is really what makes life interesting and not driven by pain.  As I was completing up with this movie,  my little cousin called me and informed me that a group of us were heading to Spidey 2 and tickets had been purchased for me too.  So it was spidey time, the movie was pretty well made, good and worthy sequel.  But then towards the end of the movie, my headache got really bad and from absolutely no where this feeling of naseua took over me.  I headed back home at 7pm, and hit the sack.  Think I slept for 15 mnutes, and the nxt thing I knew was tht I was feeling so absolutely queezy in life  was running between the loo and my bedroom, poppin medicines.  This was a horrible feeling for me, and the pain of being stuck in such a situation was miserable to say the least.  Then as though my probs were not bad enough, my body decided to play a nasty game with me, and I developed severe muscle cramps at about 9pm.     With no medicine having any effect on me, courtesy of throwing up stuff over and over, I headed to my grandpa, to seek some emotional strength.  The pain simply began to take over my senses completely and there was hardly a minute I could stay without thinking of my soulmate, he was always this person who wanted to be with me when I was sick and in pain...haha, when I needed him the most, he just couldnt be there for me.  So ironic....after all that has happend in my life off late, all the nasty stuff said, all the pain caused for people around, all the sadness which still fills my heart, and all the so called anger which I am to have towards him, I still couldnt stop thinking about him thro' every second of those 7 hours of pain!  7 hours of pain which ripped thro' me completely, so bad that the doctors at home are quite baffled with my body.    Anyway, this pain continued on and on, medicines were having no effect at all me.  Even my uncle who is a doctor came in at 3:30am in the morning to give me relief, but all went in vain. Finally with no choice left at all, I was given an injection, and that knocked me out at 4:30am.  All the pain seriously got to me and I couldnt even hold myself.  Couldnt tell my parents even that I had a blackout the previous day, coz then they would get seriously worried.   Should be heading to the hospital this evening to do a complete checkup, since I totally scared everyone out of their skins today.  God...why the hell am I being put thro this emotional and physical torture....its killing me....I've stopped asking questions, so why stil this emotional and physical turmoil for me!!!
