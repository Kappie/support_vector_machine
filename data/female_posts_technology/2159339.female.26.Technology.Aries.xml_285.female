Instead I'm on a burning frenzy. Tomorrow we set off for Winemucca, NV, first of several stops on our way to midwest, and I need my iPod ready. I'm simultaneously making M a 'goodbye' CD full of cheezy love songs I wouldn't normally put on anyone's mix exept that he's spending his last night at his mom's and I'm feeling sad and lonely and a little pathetic. Hmm..just looked at my playlist for the mix and one of every three songs is by a Stephin Merritt band. This is definitely a result of current pathetic mood. But I can't help it! I know I wouldn't feel so sentimental about us if there wasn't an expiration date attached to this relationship.  The past week has been a big haze, everything in soft focus and dreamlike (this state has led to several almost-car-collissions). I'd like to pretend that it's because I'm in love, but I know that it's really due to serious lack of sleep combined with having to work overtime. I have also taken to napping in the afternoon but when I wake up, I'm usually even more confused and tired than beforehand.  In preparation for the trip, I also got a brand new Cannon Powershot 4 megapixel digicamera. I shot a short movie, but I'm not sure if I can upload it onto blogger...will try when I get back..  It's 1:15..better try to catch the last 5 hours of some sleep. Tomorrow is going to be hell at work..and then lots and lots of driving.
