He has overnight outing with his friends starting Saturday that is why he wants a trade.  I said yes, okay.  I get the feeling again.  Nothing against N.  I am feeling left behind, that I've got nothing to do so I might as well work.  Why can't I ask for a leave just like that?  Because there is nothing to take a leave for.  I don't even have much time to binge on movies.  Maybe I should make a list like Justine in "Tough Love".  Ten things that I've never done before and dare myself to do?
