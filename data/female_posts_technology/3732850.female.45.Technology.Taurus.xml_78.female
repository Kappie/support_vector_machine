She was cooped up in a twelve by four foot kennel without ever having the opportunity to be let out to get some well needed exercise. I always felt bad playing with my dog Skippy out in the yard with Chelsey looking on, knowing that she could not come out and have some fun and exercise with us.  I asked on many occasions if I could let her out, or take her for a walk, but her owners wouldn't let me. Those people didn't deserve to have such a beautiful animal. I remember how she would look at me, her big brown eyes gazing for some attention, her ears perked up and head cocked to one side, as if to say, please save me. When I would go to visit with her I would always bring a little something special, a juicy bone, or some leftovers from dinner. I didn't care about her getting fat. She had to enjoy something in life.  That winter I let my dog outside, I could hear Skippy barking from over at Chelsey's kennel. I went to investigate, and found Chelsey breathing very heavily, she had about two inches of snow covering her and she couldn't get up. I picked her up, carried her across the yard trying to go as quickly as possible without making her anymore uncomfortable, I then placed her in my pickup and drove her to the veterinary clinic. I had the doctor look at her, he said that her lungs had filled with fluid due to the lack of shelter in the cold. She was suffering from sever pneumonia.  I notified my neighbors about bringing Chelsey to the veterinarian and about her condition. They thanked me in not so much emotion and went to visit her. I returned to the veterinarians office and checked on Chelsey again before the owners got there, she had not improved. I said my goodbyes, nowing full well that this would be the end of her misery. She was put to sleep.
