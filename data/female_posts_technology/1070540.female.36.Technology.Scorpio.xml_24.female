But because, I have never felt such love and tenderness in all my life.   It was the most amazing time I have ever had.   He made love to every inch of my body. The feeling of his hands running gently across me as he made me shut my eyes and not open them as he caressed me not knowing where he would touch next.  His sweet, tender Kisses.  The  words that he was saying to me.  Hearing the love in his voice when he  told me he loved me over and over again. We of course had made love a lot, had sex a lot, fucked a lot.  but last night was just amazing. The true  feeling of love.     This was truely one of the best nights of making love that we have ever had.  The other one I would put above this and I cried that night too, was the night we made love that it was so wonderful that he set the date for the wedding.  I never knew I could love someone like this and to be honest, sometimes its scary.  I want to protect my heart.  But I know deep down I dont need to protect it from him.  One of these days I will let me guard 100% down and he will realize that I love him as much as I say I do.  I thank God every morning and every night that he gave me such a wonderful family.  He gave me kimberly and austin and terry..knowing I would gather strength, and wisdom and give my love to and grow with.  He gave me Brian and ken to also share my love with, I have so much to give all of them. I think he gave me Brian to grow with as well, and to love with a special love. But Ken, I think he gave me him for a special reason.  God knew that I had love to give, but he also knew that I needed love and I did not know (dont) how to accept it.  I think he put us 2 together, because he knew we both needed true love and he knew Ken would teach me, not only to accept love but to teach me how to be love and how to give love to a man.  I know this sounds sappy.  But I really KNOW not think...that Ken is my  soul mate.
