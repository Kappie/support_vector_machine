Breakfast - banana/raspberry smoothey Lunch - some almonds Dinner - 2 wee little skewers of pork souvlaki, 1 roasted red pepper Snack - blueberries, watermelon  Exercise - well, in keeping with our whole "two weeks in, time to put the pressure on!" attitude, I did 30 minutes of elliptical AND 20 minutes of stretching AND 30 minutes of weight lifting AND crunches. I figure, if I'm going to watch The House Doctor, That 70's Show, Friends, Fear Factor, Body Work, AND CSI Miami, I should at least make it worthwhile. :D
