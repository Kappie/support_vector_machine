But she's now dating Mark? Fine, if love blossom, great! But she's letting Mark to go to Paris with her and Sivet when it's suppose to be Sivet's "prize" for winning the game?! That's outrageous. What does she expect Sivet to do when two of them will be pretty much stuck to each other? According to Sivet, they were not suppose to contact each other until they go on the Paris trip. But Mark jumped the gun and has now started seeing Rachel. Mark really turns me off. Can't she tell that he's so fake and dating her is just to prove that he's still the winner? Man! Good on Sivet for not wanting to pursue Rach anymore. No good man would after what she has done. Well, I hope Rach is also playing the field like Mark, or I hope I'm wrong about Mark. Either way, it's one irritating couple, from the way they speak.
