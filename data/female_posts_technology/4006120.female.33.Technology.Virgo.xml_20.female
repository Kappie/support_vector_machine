Let me see, what have I been up to for the last week...   Sunday . Not much going on, just drove around town hoping for good garage sales but no luck again. We have come to a conclusion that summer '04 is not a garage sale scorin' year. Anyway, we got to check out a couple of open houses along the way instead.   urlLink    This one had quite a view of the town. But not much to see on the house though.   urlLink    Beautiful view of Santa Rosa but for a million dollars? Crazy.  We killed time and just spent the rest of the day lazin' around...   urlLink    You see? Idle feet.  I had to get up early for an online meeting this morning anyways (charity organizatin on the works), so I didn't mind kicking back at all...watched  urlLink LXG  with Budz and took a quick nap.   urlLink     We smooched this anarchist baby all night!  Saturday.  Nice morning to run, overcast and cool. Did a quick 30-minute run in  urlLink Spring Lake . Played with the kids in the afternoon. Babysat Lilly for a little bit tonight - she spent the night with us.   urlLink     Here's Andy with his swing!    Friday . the 13th, easy day and always happy. posted a quick  urlLink entry .   Thursday.  Another employee wast terminated from work. This kind of news always makes everybody sad, worried, uncomforatable...for the rest of the day. sigh. Oh well.   Wednesday.  We tried to catch up on  urlLink Six Feet Under  and watched two episodes. We seriously need to do a marathon, we've been missing a lot. This is a really great show. We're sooo lucky we have  urlLink TiVo . You can almost play God with this thing, really.   Tuesday.  I could not find  urlLink this  cd. I don't like it when I can't find my stuff. It makes me feel old. I keep forgetting that I'm forgetting and forgetful. We also had bbq dinner with Barb's new friend Steve today. Good company, good food.   Monday.  We got a call from Carol 730ish tonight to let us know that Lily has been throwing a fit for the last hour or so because she wanted to see Goob and Kaiyen.  Goob aka Budz . Lilly has been sayin' "goob and kaiyen, that way" the minute after she picked her up from granny's after work. Went straight home and Lilly just won't stop cryin... "no papa…no paco…goob and kaiyen…that way…". Paco is the fam chihuahua... Yeah, Carol was right, she thought we'd appreciate that bit of information…it was sooo sad, poor baybee - she melted our hearts.   Saturday.  We saw  urlLink Collateral  . I enjoyed the movie a lot. I thought it was a good role for Tom Cruise. He's good at playing a villain - heartless and evil. I like how the movie was made, the shot, the angle and the use of music. It was violent but not graphic nor gory. It had substance. It was an intelligent and a very good adult thriller I think.   Friday .We grabbed a copy of  urlLink The Utimate Kauai Guidebook  at  urlLink B . Budz's nose has been stuck to this book for the last couple of days. We're trying to do this trip as cheap as possible but we have to spend a few bucks for must-do activities like the ATV waterfalls tour, the raft tour to Na Pali and the Luau. The rest is just going to be hiking, exploring the little towns, sightseeing, snorkelling and vegging out on the beach, stuff you can do with little or no cost at all. Aah, the best things in life aren't things after all. 5 more weeks and counting, oh the adventures!
