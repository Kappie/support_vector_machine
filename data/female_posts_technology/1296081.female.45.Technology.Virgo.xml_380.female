Thank goodness I went and got my hair fixed on Saturday! It was buggin' the bejesus out of me as you all know. As you can see it's a lot better than I had described on Friday. I took myself down to the  urlLink salon  and had a very nice young woman named Pam work on it. She was very good at not mocking my attempts to blend the gray. This was greatly appreciated. Truly. I explained to her that I was  urlLink going back to gray  but I couldn't deal with the blonde stuff I had in there. She was not judgemental and she determined that I needed some  urlLink lowlighting   in to offset the oncoming gray and the blonde.  She did a weave of my natural medium brown into what was ruined.  She also conditioned the hell out of it.  Then she gave me a nice cut with more layers so as not to get the "pyramid effect" of bushiness.  (NO BUSH!)  I am very happy with it and it was well worth the $85 and $10 tip that it set me back.  The money was worth not going through life with bad hair.
