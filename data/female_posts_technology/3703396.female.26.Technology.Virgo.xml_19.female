We learned the second step in creating roses, plus how to decorate with shells and drop flowers, as well as figure piping. I made clowns! My neighbor Trudy decided she does not want to go any longer, so I took my mother-in-law with me. I think she got a kick out of seeing us all try to make beautiful things out of decorator icing. My first rose came out pretty well, I must say! The shells are one of the easiest things I have learned, but I couldn't get the hearts down with tip 12. Practice makes perfect, I suppose.   Tonight I am heading to training at 5pm, then to another craft class to make a wreath for my mother-in-law. She seemed to like the birdhouse that I made for her last week in a different class. These one-day sessions are held through the  urlLink Gilbert Parks and Recreation Department .   Coming up this week: Wednesday at our house is a 5pm meeting for the Newsletter and Website Committee of San Tan Ranch. On Thursday I have training at 5pm, and Friday it's off to Las Vegas for the weekend! Hooray!
