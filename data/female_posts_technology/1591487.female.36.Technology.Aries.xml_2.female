Clearly, there has been a miraculous revolution in yarn technology which has created a whole new genre of funky knitting fun.  And goodness me, haven't I jumped on that bandwagon.  I also feel that I  now need to say sorry to those people to whom I have turned down social engagements in the past few weeks with some flimsy excuse, but in reality it's because I'm knitting.  There, I've said it. I prefer knitting to socialising.    What's happened to me?  I know what's happened to me, I've fallen into the 'craft sphere'.  Me? Doing craft? Can you believe it? How guilty do I now feel about the scoffing at the 'craft people' and making a face at the ones who said 'I made it myself'.  When now, that person is me.  Me, who spent all of yesterday wishing and hoping that someone would complement me on my scarf which, after wearing it all morning, even though I didn't feel cold, then after sweating it out, nonchalantly leaving it 'draped' over the back of my chair and making sure that I kept swivelling around so that people could see it in its full glory.  When finally someone did say something I didn't even let them finish before saying, a little too shrilly  'I made it myself!'.  But don't think I failed to notice when one of the hapless bystanders gave me the 'craft' face.  The face that I used to make, the face that says, 'Help yourself to having enough spare time on your hands to make shit'.  Why don't you get a life'.   But I didn't care.  I'm a craft person now. I can stinkin' knit a life if I want.
