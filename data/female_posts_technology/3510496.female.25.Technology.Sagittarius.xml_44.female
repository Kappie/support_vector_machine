Makan sepinggan, ye Baiyaa?  I knew too well, he was feeling a bit lazy to handle the dishwashing  . Well, it's one of Our House rules. One cooks, the other washes.  Butcha know, it's belly-belly roarrrr-man-tick to share a bowl of noodle together-gether  . Best-er, if your partner feeds you. But I chose to be the one feeding. My hubby tends to pourrrrr-get to feed me one. Poor, poor wife, right?
