My first attempt ever at a 3-needle bindoff.  A little awkward, but a heck of a lot better than seaming!    Ignore the messiness behind the scarf.  This thing is long!  It's as long as my bed (6 1/2 feet?)  Now I want one of my own, but I'll make an Azkaban style for myself.  I still need to trim the fringe so it's even, but otherwise it's done!  No more stockinette for me for a while :-)  I've been working on Charlotte too.  Joyous, one row taking 20 minutes...and they're still going to get longer!  It's cold in the lab...I wish I had her done now.
