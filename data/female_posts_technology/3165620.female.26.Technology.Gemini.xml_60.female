I suppose it was rather shocking to my system to have a pint of blood drawn just when my body was finally adapting to the altitude.  I think I'll have a hamburger or some other meat for supper tonight to make up for the lost iron and stuff. I also think I'd better not try to make any major design decisions on my code today, since I'm not exactly working at full capacity right now.  Time to get another drink of water and go back to work.
