Hmm...they're pretty freakin emo, I know. That's because this is what I listen to regularly, when I'm not getting down with a boy (which is 99% of my time despite my recent tendency to write about sex). I don't think I can go the Marvin/Barry route, either.          Pulp is quiet sexy indeed, but also extremely cheesy, like you know Jarvis wrote it hoping it would inspire people to bone. Also there's that one song about old people and you'd probably have to make a decision at a rather inopportune time - do I look for the remote so I could skip this one so we're not reminded of old incontinent people (whom I normally love) which will inevitably ruin our boners, or should I just ignore it and keep going? Hmm...
