I'll make a pie chart and attach a spinner in the middle to flick at languidly. The arrow will point to a pie piece that says "nose" or "zits" or "ladies choice." It's entirely coincidental that tomorrow is St.Patrick's Day because I don't celebrate that holiday. What do the Irish have to do with the Vietnamese? But since I have the day off and I'll be lounging about with unlimited stores of energy, I'm going to wear green and make some corned beef and cabbage. So, Irish, I'm celebrating your holiday. What are you going to do for me? That's right. You better eat that baby duck fetus! You best  gobble  that cake of pork blood! You better  dance  with that streamer and fan, if you know what's good for you... BEEYOTCH!
