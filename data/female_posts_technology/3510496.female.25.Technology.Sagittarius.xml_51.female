But only the baby ones, because they are small and crunchy. In this recipe, we make use of 2 types of cheese; Parmesan  goat cheese. Cheese-freaks, aren't we? The goat cheese actually replaces the traditional mozzarella which gives this classic Italian sandwich a more 'grown-up' twist.  4 slices of wholemeal bread (Gardenia brand) 3 baby eggplants, sliced halved 3 tsp of olive oil, for brushing 1/2 tsp of salt 3 tbsp of tomato sauce 1/3 cup of fresh Goat Cheese 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan  Heat skillet (preferably grill stove) to medium hot. Brush both sides of eggplant slices with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Place eggplant on skillet/grill. Cook until browned and softened, around 4 minutes per side.  Spread one slice of bread with tomato sauce. And then spread another with goat cheese. Top it up with the grilled eggplant slices, and cover it with the earlier slice with tomato sauce-sidedown. Brush the top-outside of the sandwich with olive oil, and pat 1 tbsp of grated Parmesan on it (The cheese should stick on the oil).  Heat on large non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Add remaining olive oil to the skillet. Place the sandwiches in the skillet. Let cook uuntil Parmesan has browned, 4 minutes per side. Serve hot. The result would be something like the Croque Monsieur you might see in Delifrance. Go and check it out.     Summer Sandwich with Egg        total time: 30 minutes  makes 6 sandwiches  Egg is another 'love' food product of hubby. I learnt that before we got married, he 'dunked' minimum one egg every day (MIL's pampering). But that is so unhealthy. Now that we are married, and in-stay our own home, I tremenduously manage to cut down on the egg-y thing. 10 eggs, could last both of us almost 2 weeks. We have it hard-boiled, half-boiled or sunny-side up on non-stick pan with very little *olive* oil. No-no deep fry 'mata lembu'.  If you notice, most of my sandwich recipes been on favoritism of hubby's. Well, I am not such a wonderful chef-tress wife, with very little time to whip up meals. But I always try my very best to serve something simple, pleasant and MOST IMPORTANT of all something he loves.  The way to win a man's heart, is through his stomach  (but that doesn't mean FATTENING him up, right). So enjoy my last recipe for this Sharing-Sandwich-Recipes Edition.  6 pieces of ciabatta bread, sliced half horizontally 6 hard-boiled eggs, sliced in half lengthwise 1/4 cup of extra-virgin olive oil 4 tsp of capers 1/4 cup of parsley leaves 2 cloves of garlic 1/2 tsp of ground black pepper 1/4 tsp of salt (or you use 3 anchovies to extract the natural saltiness) 1/2 medium orange bell pepper, thinly sliced 1/2 pint of cherry tomatoes, halved 2/3 cup of black olives, pitted and quartered  Place olive oil, capers, parsley, garlic, black pepper and salt (or anchovies) on a food processor (blender). Blend until the garlic is finely chopped for around 2 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl. Add the bell pepper, tomatoes and olives, and toss to combine. Layer the mixture on bottom half of the ciabatta, top with the 2 halves of hard-boiled eggs. Top it again with the mixture and replace the top of the loaf. Wrap the filled loaf with plastic wrap. Now, it's portable for any meal out of your home.
