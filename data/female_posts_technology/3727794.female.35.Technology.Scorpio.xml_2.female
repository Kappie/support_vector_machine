I do miss the days of big hair, drinking all night and "making some friends..."   HOLY crap my face was thin back then, but so were other things as well. Life goes on.  Picture from my college days, with Lisa, Lampy, Jildo myself and Monica before a night out on the town.  I'm now addicted to knitting and the amazing yarns...I could spend hours in the shops just petting the damn hanks of yarn. Of course, I couldn't learn to knit on the lion brand cheap stuff, NO I have to get the good stuff. Ah well, do it right or not at all.  I've survived my first 20 minute lesson on how to knit from the shop in Olathe I'm off and running. I got my Stich 'N Bitch book, good rosewood needles and can't seem to go anywhere without my bag of whatever scarf I'm working on at the time. My digital camera is on the blink, so I'm stuck scanning for now. I'll update with pics as I'd like to have a record of my accomplishments and disasters.  My first scarf:    Currently I'm making my best friend Jildo a keyhole scarf as she had an unfortunate accident with a scarf that ended up with her scraping her nose on the pavement, so even though I laughed at her (what best friend wouldn't laugh at that??? I thought this would be the solution as it should stay put when put on. I've scraped my nose many a time but usually after falling off a barstool LONG LONG ago).  Us girls at the wedding I pretend didn't happen--speed bump in my life--I prefer to think of it as the day I wore the pretty off-white dress and had fabulous hair and got lots of presents. Sounds much better than the OOOPPSS day, doesn't it?    Jildo's scarf in progress:    I've got to break away from scarves, scarves, scarves. Here's my not-yet-felted party purse in progress. I've got to go buy double pointed needles to make my first icords to do the straps. I'm not doing any of the fluff from the design, thought it would look good with the natural rainbow colors as is. Can't WAIT to felt it.    I'm not letting myself buy any new yarn at the shop until I finish Jildo's my scarf. When I'm done, here's the next project:    I think this "knitting instead of eating" thing plus my hours (ok minutes) of working out and sweating and pumping weights will allow me to be hot and skinny enough to wear the damn thing in public once I create it. Of course, I can't start with a "beginner" level pattern, but at least it's just tagged as "intermediate". I'll go till I get stuck and go to the Olathe shop for help. I love the new shop in OP, but there never is anyone that can help there. Everyone seems to be making SCARVES freaking SCARVES.
