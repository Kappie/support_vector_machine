The upscale $100-a-head circus named "Teatro Zinzanni." I'll apply, they'll muse over my application, then they will not call me. But I am making the effort! It's their loss if they don't want my freaky self working for them. My new year's resolution is to find a job in the city. Certain things are going great: new year, new apartment, new boytoy. Now, for an occupational change. Any suggestions?
