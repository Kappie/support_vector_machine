If I ever post anything that flashes or dances around on this site, I encourage you to send me all kinds of hate mail reminding me what a terrible thing I have done.    The poll came from  urlLink Bravenet , which seems to be a good service offering lots of free web services.  Of course, they have to feed their families and pets so there are ads, but I don't mind them too much.
