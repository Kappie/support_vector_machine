So the Managers go out to the flagpole with ladder and tape measures.They're falling off the ladders, dropping the tapemeasures the whole thing is just a mess.An Engineer comes along and sees what they're trying to do, walks over, pulls the flagpole out of the ground,lays it flat, measures it from end to end, gives the measurement to one of the managers and walks away.After the Engineer has gone, one manager turns to another and laughs. "Isn't that just like an engineer! We're looking for height and he gives the Length"  Moral: No matter what good you do, Managers can always find faultin Engineers.
