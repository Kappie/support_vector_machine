The Honey Dew Melon tasted like vanilla shake with a hint of honey dew, while the Thai tasted like a sweet iced tea.       Of course, pictured here are the melted versions after sitting in the car for a while.  Originally they are more like a Slurpee or a Slushie instead of a liquid.  Andrew said it best when asked about the flavor of the bobas (the balls at the bottom):  "They taste like ass."  (Not that he's ever tried "ass", to the best of my knowledge...)  The little boba balls are extremely squishy and chewy and I would not recommend trying them, unless you are very adventurous!  These were purchased at Yen Mi Restaurant inside Lee Lee's Supermarket at the corner of Dobson and Warner Roads in Chandler, Arizona.  They are $2.99 each.  Lee Lee's also sells the Boba in both natural and tapioca flavors to make at home yourself.  They are $2.29 for a 2.2 pound package.
