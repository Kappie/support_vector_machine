It's right below the Ramada Inn on Granville St. As you immediately walk in you know that you just entered the land of beautiful people. The wait staff was gorgeous and there was plenty of eye candy walking around. The music was fabulous and everyone looked like they were having an awesome time! We were here for a "holiday" called Irf Day. Silly Brandon and friends get together once a year, at a different location, to celebrate and party for a friend of their's named Irfaan. Irfaan is an interesting fellow who doesn't smoke, drink, or do anything that is against his religion. So, what a better excuse for his friends to do all that for him? :)   urlLink    Cecilia, Surbhi (our new friend), and Brandon at Gingers in Vancouver, BC. Very cool place, lots of cute people and yummy drinks.
