I didn't know cita has bcome ITU, what does that stand for?  Updates updates? Gossips gossips?  So who's married? Who's having 2nd or 3rd child? Who's attached? Who's learning to walk/run/sit?  I recently knew an accquintance (a NUS SoC undergrad who went on a yr technoprenuer internship with Sybase, US and came to Sg branch to complete his work) and think that he has potential of being a golden tortise.. but, look wise.. eer.. ok lar but switch of the lights first. Haha. I'm mean. But people attach liao loh, and I too lazy to try to keep in contact or "detach" him.. so I'm still enjoying my singlehood.. next wk KL, then Bali, Penang, Tioman, Europe one day? =*o*=  How time flies, I've left Sydney for 1 year, and cita for 3 yrs and I'm turning 26! *gosh*
