Compared to the average second grader, I type at lightning speed!  As I was leaving, a small, blonde, freckled girl complimented me on my little pink purse.  There's nothing like a trip to the second grade to give you a little confidence boost.  The girls give me lots of compliments on my clothing and accessories.  Some people even ask where I got certain things.  I try and return the favors.  One time I noticed that a girl got her ears pierced and she was so excited.  The teacher hadn't even noticed.  At school today, I also got to hear a little more of the BFG story.  The parts I've heard are all broken up but I think it has something to do with storing dreams in jars.  Some of my dreams I certainly wouldn't want to put in a jar and keep forever.  I think I'd rather keep real-life moments.  I'm going to see Harry Potter 3 tonight with Jason.  It was sold out when I tried to see it with Chris Dicken's Movie Nights.  I actually know  the  Chris Dickens, so you'd think I would have been able to get in, but I didn't try that hard.
