Unfortunately, our greatest challenge seems to be finding a general contractor who isn't too busy to build our home! Tampa has been exploding in terms of development, and I suspect the construction industry is the one industry, in this region, that has never known what "recession" really means.        urlLink http://www.domega.org/     Scroll down to the Jan 5, 2004 entry, and click on the "Read More" link to see a computer mock-up of what the place will look like.  Yesterday we visited the property because it turns out we have some banana trees and they were making bananas! I'd never owned a fruiting banana tree before. When we got there, Frank said: hey, look! And Finally, for the first time, we got to see the little bugger tenant we need to treat carefully when we start construction - a gopher tortoise. There he was, in broad daylight, hiking across the lawn. I knew where his burrow was, so I quickly jumped out and ran over, and stopped him. I was surprised at how quickly he can move, I'm sure he saw me, but I got him anyway. He's quite heavy, a good 4-5 pounds. Cute little fellow! No, we didn't have a camera. Gopher tortoises are protected in Florida, and we have to capture any tortoises in live burrows on our property and relocate them elsewhere on our property before we can start construction. So after we all got a good look at him, we let him go and off he went, back in his burrow. I'm amazed the burrow is Exactly the right size for him, I don't think there was 3 millimeters to spare on either side of his shell when he scurried back in.  All in all, part of a great day that included "fishing". I say "fishing" because we're great at feeding the fish, not catching them. I don't ever remember having so much trouble catching anything in NJ when we were growing up. In fact, I have one childhood picture of my sister and I angelically smiling for the camera, along with a monstrous carp sitting in front of us. Yep, it was as big as my little sister, and she was the one who hooked it. It nearly had her for lunch. But down here, I guess it's such a tourist state and you have so many naive tourists coming in trying to fish that the fish have learned how to steal bait without getting hooked. We tried to catch mullet with bread, and kept the bait near the surface so we could see. Almost immediately when the bait goes in, you see it buffeted around wildly as the fish munch away. Within seconds it's gone, and you don't even have an opportunity to set the hook! Must be using the wrong hook... No crabs either.
