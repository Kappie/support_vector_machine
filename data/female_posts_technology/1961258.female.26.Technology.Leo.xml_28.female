The first workout is always the hardest .. to get you right off you a**.   Eating is still horrible! Dinner plan didn't work for yesterday but we'll see about tomorrow.  I am so disheartened about my weight. I'm SEVENTY SEVEN kilograms. I look in the newspapers and I see these ads for these slimming salons and their great results .. and the biggest woman on there is 67 kgs and she looks pretty hefty. So what do I REALLY look like? Not what I think in my mind, eyes .. most definitely. Just made me .. feel horrible, because I am horribly big. No more excuses .. no more 'I carry it well' or 'it looks better on me' or 'i have a big frame'
