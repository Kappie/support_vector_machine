Because in 2 years, the "kinda perfect" house will be obsolete, and you will want more more more! GRRRRRRRRRRRRR what were we thinking? Now, we REALLY did find the perfect house... and it could slip through out clammy, stressed out fingers! Some people I tell ya.... Stupid important people to the process get to take week long vacations in MEXICO while we sit here and piss ourselves thinking it won't get done in time. GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. That's about all I have to say about that.  Thank GOD its almost Friday... now that Wednesday is almost over, I can say that. LOL Maybe, just MAYBE if we are lucky, Mr. Meanie will not be here tomorrow or Friday.... YEAH wishful thinking! Atleast he seems to have lightened up a bit.  Ok, its time to go home and play with the munchkin.... The 1 thing that makes the crappy days worth while!
