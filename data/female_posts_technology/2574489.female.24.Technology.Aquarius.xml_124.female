I made Pesto Pasta again for our potluck at work today and people loved it. I had 2 asking for the recipe!   But what a good potluck...bbq and sausages, beans, potato salad, lasagna, bread (can you say carbs galore?), my pesto pasta, meatballs and rice, and my absolute favorite, curry w/ pork over white rice (had 3 servings)!  Yum!  And co-worker K, one of our older co-workers, brought home-baked desert, called Better Than Sex....that's right, it was called Better Than Sex...boss referred to it as 'BTS' to be PG.   Funny story: P, another co-worker who brough the curry and white rice, asked me to go to the kitchen with him before the potluck started.  He then proceeded to show me how to cook rice.  I thought he has some unique way of cooking rice, or had something interesting to show me, but it became apparent he, this tall, red-haired guy, was showing me, the Asian, how to cook rice!  I interrupted him.    I told him, "Uh, I've been cookiing rice since I was ten years old!"  I now have officially 1 hr and 40 min. till freedom.  We did NOT close early.
