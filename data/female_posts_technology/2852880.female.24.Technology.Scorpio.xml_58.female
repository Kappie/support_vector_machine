The biggest thing it's lacking is some sort of IMAP or POP service so I can use it with Outlook or Outlook Express.  United recently announced that they're bringing back the ice cream sundae to their Premier First Class service.  I wonder if they read my blog...  Had a good time at the W Saturday night.  Yanda came back to visit.  He thinks I should go to Prague with B.  I think that's a great idea.  Karen was wearing some great heels, and she introduced me to her friend, Mark, who has horrible taste in cocktails.  I took some pics but I can't get them off my camera phone.  Sopranos night was uneventful.  I brought cupcakes with the rainbow chip frosting.  That stuff should be regulated.  You should have seen the Pfau sisters devour the frosting off their cupcakes!  It's so good.  I prefer yellow cake with white icing.  None of that lemon stuff though.  Best way to ruin a cupcake.    Bought tickets for Nepal this morning for Tommy and me.  I used my magic to get us some sweet seats.  I can't wait.  Only 7 1/2 months.   Seven and a half cents, doesn't mean a helluva lot Seven and a half cents, doesn't mean a thing But give it to me every hour Forty hours every week That's enough for me to be  Living like a king!  --The Pajama Game
