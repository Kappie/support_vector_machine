My excellent, co worker , Brad, is cute, funny, just turned 21. Anyway he looked in one of the boxes and showed me two little fruit flies flying around in one of them! I set that pie aside, and labeled it so no one would give it away. I named our two new pets "Sammy" and "Bud." And I watched them throughout the day.  Everyone there knows that while I'm working, I always like to go to the Sam's Club cafe and order a frozen coke, or the red, minute-maid equivalent. They act worried if they see me without my drink! Except for the distraction of my little pets, the rest of the day went as usual. Just 3 of us worked the membership desk today, taking everyone's picture for their new membership card, giving them their money back for stuff they don't want or that broke. Ho hum.
