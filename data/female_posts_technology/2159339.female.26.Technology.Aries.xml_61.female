On an otherwise cheerless block, the MAXX family had strung up colorful sparkly lights around their house, decorated their front window, and even had a big glowing snowman on their roof. I knew right away it was theirs.  Mrs. Maxx made the most wonderful Christmas feast. It was straight out of a Christmas cartoon: there was glazed ham, soft juicy turkey, tart sweet cranberry sauce with real cranberries, a bowl of tiny roasted potatoes, stuffed mushrooms, walnut and pomegranate salad and a cheese and cracker platter. We drank wine and champagne and for dessert there were homemade apple pies, cheesecake, ice cream, and Christmas cookies. I was in heaven. Thank god for Jesus being born! Happy Birthday Jesus!! Hallelujah, Amen, and Mm-mm-MM!  Afterwards Abby and I went home and TJ tagged along. He bombed her car with a foul wretched stanky fart, then he came into our home and bombed my room! I was like, "Damn you, TJ, poo already! I command you to release thy noxious fecal obstruction because Abby and I will perish in these ignominious fumes!" Oh, it was awful. After his punitive display of gaseous emissions was over, we got stoned and watched my favorite Xmas movie, Home Alone. We rarely smoke, but we were bored and all the bars were closed. I looked at us --the three of us so usually averse to smoking pot-- passing around a crushed Diet Coke can and torching the booger-esque herb perched atop it, and started laughing. I made choke-y sobby sounds and declared: "Look at us! We Are On Drugs!!"  And we all laughed together that stupid inhaling stoner laugh: Uhhhhh... uhhhhhhh... uhhhhhhhhhh.
