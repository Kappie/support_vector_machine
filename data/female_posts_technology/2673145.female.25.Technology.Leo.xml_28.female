Once again, the destiny of Jesus Christ has touched me and I cried again. :~(   This movie narrated the chapter of John from the New Testament. It also explained the things that had been said and done, according to the Bible. It takes you through the final journey of Jesus; the miracles he performed, the teachings (which are really hard to understand), the final hour, the crucifixion, and his rising.   This movie takes on a different angle compare to "Passion of Christ". Same story, but "Passion" focused on the agony and tortures that Jesus had gone thru. It had a greater impact on mankind while "Gospel" gave a better explanation which I think will benefit only the believers. Although "Passion" followed closely to the Bible, it had the director's own additions that may be interpreted differently by different people. "Gospel" is almost the Bible brought to screen, except there's variations to what I've read. I guess the Bible had been reproduced so much that there's deviations or variations from the original. Who knows the original then?   A picture tells a thousand words. Watching the movie allows me to understand the Bible better and it certainly left a deeper impression in me. I'm a "graphic" person. I remember pictures better then words. ;)
