It is cool her and I talk really easily and we totally feel comfortable around each other. She wants to be an RN, the only problem I have is she is thinking of dropping her fall classes and joining the Navy and getting licensed through the military. I really don't want her to enlist, but she is 18 and can make her own decisions. I will be supportive what ever she may decide. She is going to the museum w/ grammy today. I don't think she really wants to go. Just does not want to upset grammy ya know? LOL I am bringing her out Sat night and Marcella is probably going to meet us out. I am glad I have not seen nor talked to her in a couple of weeks. I miss her too. Ok enough for now talk soon.
