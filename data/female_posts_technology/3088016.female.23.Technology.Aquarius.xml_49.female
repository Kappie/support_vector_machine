People like me.  It occurred to me today when a co-worker told me that she liked something I had written (and I liked hearing it) that I wanted to do so more often; and that there's easy way to let friends know that even if I haven't called them, I'm not dead.      Suggestions are welcome for things you would - or wouldn't - like to see here.
