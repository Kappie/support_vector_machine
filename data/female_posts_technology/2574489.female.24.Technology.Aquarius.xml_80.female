This has different sects, just like Christianity has many different sects i.e. Catholicism, Baptism, Protestanism.  Sports' different sects include Baseball, Basketball, and Football.  For Football, just like in Catholicism, there is one major night where everyone, regardless of how lax they have been in their worship the whole year, will pay their respects to their religion and worship--everybody expects it of them.  For us it's Easter Sunday.  For them, it is Super Bowl.   Tonight was Super Bowl for the Football religion, and somehow I got an invitation to repent for all my years of sinning by attending a Super Bowl party.  I asked if there would be communion.  My hostess said there would be chips and dip instead.  I asked would I have to drink wine?  She replied it would be better than that.  Aside from wine, they would also have beer, and other types of alcohol.  I said sure.  So my husband and I attended the worship, and was inspired by their fervent enthusiasm.  I mean, being a Catholic, I'm used to a pretty sedate Mass.  Everyone was jumping and hollering, and laughing, and being merry.  One girl in particular inspired me.  C was gesturing with enthusiasm, screaming louder than everybody else, dancing, gyrating, gesturing things I did not understand...it looked like the holy spirit had taken a hold of her.  She had the rest of us laughing our asses off (this religion seemed very lax on profanity).    At the end of the game, when the New England Patriots won by 1 point from a winning field goal, I was jumping up and down as loud as her.  She turned to us with triumphant eyes.  "Thank you, Jesus!"  she exclaimed (it turned out she was a believer of both Christianity and Sports).  She then revealed that she had bet $1000 on the Patriots and had just won $3000.  The next minute was a blur as the mass ended and we went on our way.  We did not genuflect before we left the altar.  I'm sticking to Catholicism, but discovering other religion is truly refreshing...I wonder if C will have to thite a part of her winnings?  ***  This Week's  Bedroom Fortune :   A new opportunity will soon come your way  in bed .  (Not that funny, but the Japanese buffet we went to did not give out fortune cookies.  When we went to a mall nearby, their Panda Express in their food court was closed.  So I settled for this one, which my husband's jacket pocket coughed up mysteriously.)
