It's like they're all on speed! they talk so fast you can't understand them, and they never even finish a thought anyway, so most of the time, there's really no point in listening. they would spin in circles for hours if you let them. 30 seconds into the bus ride, they jokingly (at least i hope it was jokingly) asked if we were there yet. i just laughed it off and daydreamed out the window. i had 6 in my group, my niece, three other girls and two boys. two of the girls, unfortunately, seemed to be the class rejects. nobody wanted to pair up with them, and they didn't even want to pair up with each other. they were pushy and bossy, but not really much more than most of the kids i grew up with. i believe one of the boys was the class gigolo, and i found out he has a crush on my niece. he's a cutie, though. polite, a "gentleman" as he coined himself. the other boy was just strange. like the kid who used to talk to himself in the back of the room and shout out weird sounds from time to time. that kind of strange. he would raise his hand to either ask or answer a question, but not have anything to actually say when he was called on. do all kids do this? kinda freaked me out. the last girl was a friend of my niece's. she was a cute little girl but kinda copped an attitude with me near the end. i don't deal well with prima donnas.   but all in all, the kids had a good time, and i think i did a pretty good job. would i do it again? depends on where we're going.
