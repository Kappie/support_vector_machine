'specially here in LA.      i resent this article... to think it came from my own people!!!! i think i'm going to vomit:     What is it about Korean Women that Western Men Like?  We know that Korean-American Alice Kim (Korean name: Kim Yong-gyeong) willmarry Hollywood star Nicolas Cage in June. Kim’s uncle, an executive at acredit agency, said in an interview with a Korean daily paper that, “I understand that Alice Kim and Nicolas Cage will marry in June.” This marriage may be postponed, however; Cage is leaving for Africa in July toshoot his new film, “Lord of War.”  Why are American film stars into Korean women? Kenny, an executive at a LAKoreatown broadcasting company, said in an interview with a Koreanbroadcaster that, “Korean women are submissive and kind. They are known to make breakfast, lunch and dinner for their husbands, help their husbandswell, and raise children well." There are also those who feel that in the eyes of Western men, East Asian women possess a sort of mysteriousness about them. They say that one can grow fond of the unknown “Orient."  24-year-old James Cecil, an American living in Korea, said, “Even Koreanwomen who are not though of as pretty by Korean men can give a sense of mystery to Western men.” 29-year-old English teacher Mike Conforty said,“Korean women are gentle, feminine and quiet. I think Korean women are theprettiest of all East Asian women.”  Western men also seem to find the purity and conservativeness of Koreanwomen attractive. 25-year-old USFK soldier Blake Selesnew said, “Americanwomen are too materialistic, but Korean women aren’t. They seem less snobby.” Korea University English instructor Zane Ivy said, “Korean women are conservative. They are conscience of what people around them think,depend on their families and parents and are submissive.”  Before Alice Kim and Nicolas Cage, other Hollywood couples with Koreanwomen included Wesley Snipes and Nikki Park and Woody Allen and Soon-Yi Previn. Less well known was “About Schmidt” director Alexander Payne’smarriage last year to Korean-Canadian actress Sandra Oh. Meanwhile, WoodyAllen attended a literature event last October in Frankfurt, Germany andsaid he would write an autobiography containing the story of how he splitfrom long-time lover Mia Farrow and fell in love and married Farrow’s adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn.
