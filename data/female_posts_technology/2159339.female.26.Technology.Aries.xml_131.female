           
       Full of Air  During my mom's birthday dinner, I sat at the table and chatted with my brother's gf, while we waited for him to arrive.  I was complaining about how I'm trying to single-handedly finish this half-gallon of milk that expires in two days. I was like, "Oy, I put it in my cereal, I drink it with some coffee for flavor, but oof, all that milk just makes me so BLOATED!" Then this woman at a nearby table turns abruptly and shoots a disapproving glare in my general direction. She wasn't ballsy enough to look me directly in the eye, but shoots her pissy pussface look at the somewhat area of maybe my table. Apparently, she was an old crone-hag whose meal was soured by my indigestion.  I know I was in a restaurant. But who wants to make boring genteel talk, when there are more urgent matters to address, namely lactose intolerance? What is so wrong with the word BLOATED? I didn't use gasssy, I didn't use fartarded, I didn't use monster poot. I was just trying to make some pre-dinner conversation before our appetizers. Is that so wrong?    And, if she wants to get all Miss Manners-y, she herself should ascribe to the #1 adage of politeness: "Mind one's own beeswax!"
