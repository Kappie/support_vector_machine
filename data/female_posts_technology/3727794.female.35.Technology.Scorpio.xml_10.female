For if God is truly as I've been taught,    an uptight old white man, I will be caught.    And tho' I'm a good mother and a kind friend,    My dating old guys will take me down in the end.        Down to Dante's Inferno, Nine levels of hell.    I took the quiz, didn't fare too well.    Scored high on two levels of the nine    Gonna hang with the lustful and gluttonous for all time.        But if God's a gay guy or a chic just like me,    There might still be hope, in a happy place I could be.    Floating above the clouds, shining down beams of joy    Instead of suffering the hurricane of unquenchable desire    with Cleopatra and Helen of Troy.        --prayer by TreasureGoddessChic       OK, I'm definitely cutting down on the flirting with old guys thing. Takes me to icky places like lunch today with an old old-guy friend. Mark told me I can ride in his  Russell's handbasket to hell, so at least I'll have company on the trip down. While eating and deciding to mend my ways, I came up with this little poem....ok, realize I like OTHER people's quotes and wordsbecause I am not gifted in the writing department.  Update on the biting/hitting incident. Joey's friend Mya was trying to kiss him, he "wrestled her" to make her stop, she bit him, he "whomped" on her. Apparently "whomp" is 4 yr old for hit/scratch. He's still got little bruised teeth marks, so the little chica knows how to look out for herself pretty well. I had the talk that "little boys can't go around whomping on girls" and felt like a sexist pig. Oh well, he seemed to get the point. I told him he probably shouldn't be whomping on anyone unless he's already told a teacher and the kid won't stop bothering him. It's a thin line you walk when you try to keep your kid tough without making him a bully. I feel like whomping on someone myself.
