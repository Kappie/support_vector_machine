It was small, dark, and somewhat damp but it was a refuge in which to rest safely for a little while.  "I thought maybe we could go to another village and start a new life but I really haven't thought that far."  Aidan admiited as he ran his fingers through his black hair, his dark eyes glowed in the gloom of the cave.  The sun outside warmed up the air a little and lit the inside of the cave but it was still chilly and full of shadows.    "Maybe we can move around a little before settling down in another village.  Besides I still think you should go home.  You're not a witch and your family is there."  Morrigan picked up Aidan's hand and squeezed it tightly.    "Morrigan."  Aidan sighed.  "Haven't you figured it out yet?"  "Figured what out?"  Morrigan asked completely at a loss, not understanding the message Aidan was trying to impart to her.  "That I want to be with you.  I want to protect you and take care of you.  I want to love you and have children with you."  Aidan squeezed her hand back and looked into her green eyes.  Morrigan sat for a moment is shocked silence before really taking a look at Aidan and remembering all the times he stood up for her while growing up in the village.  He always seemed to be there in the background when she did get into trouble.  She remembered this one boy throwing rocks at her and screaming witch when she won a children's game.  Aidan was there to stop the boy from throwing rocks and to take her home safely.  Another time she had gotten so angry that she caused trees and bushes within five feet of her to shake like a terrible wind storm.  Aidan was quick to grab her and carry her off into the forest until she calmed down.  There certainly wasn't anything wrong with his looks either, she thought with a smile and a glance.  His dark hair, pale face, dark eyes and a full mouth created a dream face that every girl dreamed of marrying.  He stood at least six feet with stocky arms and a solid build with strong muscles from working in the fields all day.    She smiled at him, loosened her hand from his and stepped outside in the bright sun.  She turned around to find that he had followed her outside.  "Aidan, are you sure that I am the one you want?  I am a witch and one of our daughters will be a witch and so forth as it has always been.  We will be persecuted just like my mother."  Morrigan paused and listened to the specters that clung to this world.  She whispered questions about her Mother and her worries to them in hopes that they could help.  Suddenly one appeared in front of Morrigan and Aidan.  Morrigan pushed Aidan behind her as she faced the dark specter.  "Child of the land, your Mother is dead by the hands of the ignorant.  You must go from here for they are looking for you and spreading word through the closest villages who pass it on to other villages.  You must go north into the old land of the fair folk for only then will you be safe from harm."  The specter ended by pointing a ghastly bony finger to the north and slowly disappeared back into his world.  Morrigan sighed.  She would grieve later for her mother and give her last rites.  She looked at Aidan's pale face before glancing North.    "What was that, Morrigan?"  Aidan finally asked after a few minutes of waiting to see if it was really gone.  "That was a ghost from the other world.  I heard voices so I asked a few questions though usually they don't appear like that unless it's important.  It appears we have champions to our cause.  We must head north for I have no doubt that the villagers are right behind us."  Morrigan grabbed her sack from the cave and grabbed Aidan's pack that he had packed before he had come to warn her last night.  Aidan took his pack, squeezing Morrigan's hand before placing his pack on his back.  "So we go to the North, the land of the fair folk.  I had always thought those were just stories.  I do have to say that life with you won't ever be boring, my morri."  He smiled at her before taking the lead through the forest slowly threading their way between rocks and trees.  "But you must be careful of the fair folk for like the stories say they are tricksters and pranksters.  They love to make the human kind mad with their fun and games.  It definitely shall be different from living a dull life in the village."  Morrigan laughed at that thought, hurried to catch up with Aidan, and took his hand in hers.   To my husband who hasn't read these stories yet
