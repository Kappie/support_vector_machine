WE NEED MORE OIL!!! THEY ARE GOING TO STICK!!! CAREFUL!!! CAREFUL!!! TURN THEM!!! TURN THEM!!! HURRY UP!!! ARE YOU CRAZY!!!! THE OIL IS GOING TO SPILL!!! USE MORE SALT!!! THE SALT!!!!"  The wife was very upset, "What is wrong with you? Why are you yelling like this? Do you think I don't know how to fry an egg?"  The husband calmly replied, "This is to show you what it feels like for me when I am driving and you sit next to me..."
