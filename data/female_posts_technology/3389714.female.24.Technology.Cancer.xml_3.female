I managed to get in a WHY? in between all her senseless babble… She managed to calm herself down to tell me that I needed to take my dad to the hospital…I was baffled ..i mean dad and hospital in the same sentence..my dad’s like superman..he can withstand any kind of pain…I was shocked..mom told me he didn’t sleep all night..and he was feeling awful today…basically what happened was Sunday afternoon…my dad and bro…decided to be macho and install a built in A/C unit all by themselves…mom and I did not take much concern to their project due to the fact that they always do stuff around the house..and with dad being an architect…mom and I assumed that he must now a thing or two…so we decided to go to PA and hit the mall…We came home around 7ish to find a stretch band-aid around dad’s right foot…dad said it was a minor sprain and we ignored it and gave the man two aspirins…Anyways, mom decided that now she will take dad to hospital and that I should go to pick him up…when he calls…so dad called and I went to pick him up..he stated that he had a fracture in his leg..i didn’t know what to say ..other then ok what next..he stated we need to go to the out patient ward to pick up x-rays and then head to an orthopedic surgeon’s office…we went to Dr. Tan’s…to find out that he will be in at 1..we got an appointment at 1:30 and headed home…dad called up his work and told them that he will not be in today..i called up my work and told them I’d be in before 4..it odd how ppls at my work are so considerate about dad’s condition ..while dad’s boss and co-workers started stressing..i guess he had many solo projects he was working on… I ended up watching TV for about and hour and a half then had lunch..took dad to the orthopedic surgeons office..to got a plaster cast put on his leg…it was odd having a another person give dad instructions on how he should go about living life for the next few weeks..Dad never listens to anyone…anyways dropped dad at home and I rushed to work..didn’t break the record of 3 min..i hit 2 traffic lights..damn..oh well…got to work everyone was like how’s dad?..i stated fine ..and went on my business…I had to do stat analysis on last weeks activities however wrong reports were given to me..gotta go back and tell sister company to run stats again… I’m not having a bright day…oh well…gotta get back to work..hopefully this is how bad it get..can’t picture any more chaos in my life…lets c it’s only 4:21 pm.    New Development: Saw a new guy that must have been just hired at our sister company…and let me tell u he is damn yummy…mmm' mmmm' good!
