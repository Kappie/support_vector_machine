Today is 2:25 p.m., Saturday.  Last week I bought four books.  Clive Barker's "Weaveworld", John Sandford's "Fool's Run", Robotech #2 and a romance book by a female author whose name I forgot.   Thank you for the tuition fee for Arianne and Kat.  Kat just finished her exams.  Mom complains to me that she does not see Kat study hard, that Kat does not give her reviews enough time.  I tell her that maybe Kat understands her lessons well enough that she does not need to take the time to memorize.  Arianne will take her exams this week.   Dad, since the money you sent is for tuition, you will still send us the second half of the allowance right?  Mom used almost all of it to pay for the girl's tuition.   The family is watching Magandan Tanghali Bayan.  The grand finals of the Feeling F4 contest is being held today.  On September, two of the members and Barbie Xu will have a concert.  The concert tickets are steep, but the fans will surely go ahead and buy.   How and where did you spend your birthday? Next month ako naman.     Kathreen is out practicing for the sabayang bigkas.  She said that she is also one of the hosts of the event.   Mom keeps on mentioning to me the past two days that maybe Arianne and her boyfriend broke up because we don't see Gian as often as before and we don't see them talking on the phone anymore.  Maybe it's her way of telling me to ask my sister about it.   While I'm waiting for the page to load, I scan the amazon website w/c currently lists Clive Barker's books.  An acquaintance of mine mentioned the author as his favorite maybe two years ago and it's just now that I gave Clive a chance to get a response out of me.  "After three, the multitude."   Sometimes there are books that call out to me so that everytime I get into a bookstore I always go to the section where the book is and look at it to see if it may be worth my money.  Other times I remember conversations where an author or a title of a book was mentioned and I start to check it out.   Here comes the 5th group contestant of the Feeling F4 contest.  I wonder if the real F4 are also watching.  Okay di ba? I mean, Meteor Garden, the soap which catapulted them to fame was released about 2 years ago pa sa Taiwan, HK, Singapore, Thailand and other kapitbahays pati na sa US tapos ngayon lang sumikat sa Pilipinas so hanggang ngayon kumikita pa rin sila.  Phenomenon sila ulit.   Anong balita dyan? From the news iniimbistigahan pa rin ang mga officials na kumikita ng maliit pero maraming bahay at kotse.  Nabalitaan mo ba na may 3 bold stars na kinuha ang pangalan sa failed coup? Glorietta Magadalo, Tanya Trillanes and Angelika Rebella.     Re:Books, remittance, F4   Mahal kong anak,     Thank you for asking. I'm slowly going back to my old exercise routine. It's getting better.I hope I don't reinjure it. About Arianne and her BF, it could simply be a little spat that both of them could patch up. If they can't make it they should move on, continue with their studies. It might be better that way--excel in their school work.   As for Kathreen, I hope she's not letting up on her studies. Alam mo naman, pag mediocre ang marka sa escuelahan mahirap makakuha ng trabaho. Kathreen and Arianne should keep that in mind. Nobody else will help them--not their boyfriends.  Anak, what or who is F4? Sorry, snob si Dad mo. Wala akong Filipino Channel. I'd like to but most Filipino shows aired here by ABS-CBN are lousy. The acting is terrible, dialogue is dull, and stage set lacks creativity. These kind of programming insults a person's intellect. Akala nila tanga ang kanilang viewers. That's what happens when you don't have any competition.  In the meantime, in the US, rumors of additional coups abound, reports of the first gentleman's supposed assets gloss our publication. Have you heard about absentee voting and dual citizenship? Well, presidentiables are here campaigning--Roco, Macapagal, and Lacson.  Before I forget, anak, I'll have the last third of July's remittance soon the other half of August a bit later. And, I have your CD's (Michael Buble and Norah Jones). They'll be in the BBox with some of the DVD's  I burned for you. Talk to you later, mahal kong anak. Please extend my love to John and your two sisters. Again, ingat lagi.   Dad
