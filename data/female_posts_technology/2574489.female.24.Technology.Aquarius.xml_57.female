October...I remember I wanted to go to the dentist before my wedding!   3. ...filled your gas tank?  Last Monday, before going to work.   4. ...got enough sleep?  Last Saturday. I slept in until 12:00 pm, woke up for an hour, went back to sleep until 3:30 pm...the shame!   5. ...backed up your computer?   We just reinstalled the OS on our PC about six months ago.  And even if we wanted to backup our files we have no CD-R drive on it, not even a zip drive.  Maybe a tape backup? On floppy disks?  I hate our PC...someone buy me a new one already!
