This new  urlLink article  from WebMD Health asserts that there are toxins in our cars that may cause adverse cardiovascular "events," presumably heart attacks.    The narrowly based study was performed on nine (why not ninety?) healthy state troopers who worked in their cars.  The funny part comes in when they described how officers may spend up to 35% of a shift away from their cars, among other activities, eating dinner.  Is no one examining the chicken fried steak and cigarettes they had when they stopped for grub?  I wonder if my boss will let me work from home because of these astounding new findings.  I'm betting not.
