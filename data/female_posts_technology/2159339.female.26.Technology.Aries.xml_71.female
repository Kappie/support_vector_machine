Never have I seen so many Hot Topic suburban kids in my life. Not since, erm, summer's Live 105's BFD have I seen such a sea of white teen angst. It was pouring rain, but all the acne-ridden girlies with cakey make-up were wearing spaghetti-strap tank tops and denim cutoffs. They posed and stared around dully at all the other alterna-teens while puffing coolly on their cigarettes. Ugh. Effin suburbanites! I don't care how cool you want to be! If you want to smoke a cigarette, fine, but you have to step outside. If you want to be a smoker, then you have to go out in the rain. Those are the rules. This is why I do not like all ages shows: the complete anarchy!!!   W-gal and I downed tiny $7 cups of beer and scarfed down some $5 pizza. We got pretty close for the talented and amazing BRMC. What was less talented and not amazing at all was the testosterone-soaked mosh pit and the 1993-style slam dancing aka "pass-the-dude". Who wants to pass a rain-drenched damp teenage guy? That is like getting the smell of wet dog on your hands. You would need some quick Purel action to sanitize that funk.   We stayed and watched Rancid, Iggy and the Stooges, and W-gal's favorite, The Offspring. Yes, it is a tragedy to see a grown woman know all the words to The Offspring, but as I told her that night, "W-gal, I forgive your nostalgia. Now go in peace."   The funniest thing that happened that night was when 3 teensy weensy girls wearing the exact same outfit -flimsy black tanks, jeans, and studded belts- ran in front of us, and in their excitement at hearing The Offspring, squealed, quickly grabbed each other's hands and jumped up and down in glee. It was like a baby-punk Ring-Around-the-Rosy. W-gal and I looked at each other. We knew what each other was thinking. We quickly grabbed ahold of each other's hands and jumped up and down and up and down. We jumped up and down because there were punk munchkins in front of us jumping up and down to The Offspring.
