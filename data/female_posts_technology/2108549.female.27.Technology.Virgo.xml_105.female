And then I met a new guy.  I like him, quite a bit actually.  Lately I have been missing the relationship I had.  Not the man I had it with per se, but the relationship itself. I miss loving someone in that *awe inspiring, tummy flutters, light up my life* kinda way.  Not to mention I miss being loved that way.  aside from all the BS and deciet, that relationship was great in that area. If only for that reason alone I cannot regret that relaitonship.  It taught me a lot about being loved and loving someone else.  I don't know what's gonna happen or even anything will happen with this guy.  I'm just glad that I finally feel ready to move on from the last one.
