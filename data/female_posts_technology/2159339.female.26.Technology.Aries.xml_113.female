But in actuality, I'm a snail with a lightning bolt spray painted on its shell. Prepping a chicken to be roasted does not take 5 minutes, apparantly. Ultimately, when the chicken was done it was crisp, tender, and juicy -- well worth the wait, but it made me miss the first band, Communique,  one of my favorite local acts. We got there right as they were taking down the drums and carrying their equipment off stage. I was a little bummed, but I'd seen them twice before.   Low Flying Owls  -- the bassist has the exact same style as Kings of Leon: longish 70s hair with thick bangs and moustache. They were pretty good and I liked some of their songs, but there was nothing distinctive about them. They could play their instruments fine, but they weren't pushing any envelopes. Their sound is very "now" (Cure influenced, Gang-of-Four influenced, new wavish) but they didn't have that special something that makes me look up from my drink. They're ambitious with the sound they want to achieve, but I think they need some time to grow into it and own it.   Dead Science  -- This is what I came for. This is what Noisepop is about. Exposing me to new bands that will make me drool from my ears. When they were setting up I had no idea what they'd sound like because their individual aesthetics were so different. The drummer looked like an everyman: he had on a polo shirt and khakis (or something to that Gap extent), the bassist looked like Pee-Wee Herman's indie cousin: floppy asymmetric Flock of Seagulls hair, velvet blazer ruffly foppish shirt- I think there were polka dots or rainbow colors, and the singer-guitarist had a perfect pompadour, cowboy shirt, and denim jeans. XX said he looked just like Carl Perkin. Would they be Rockabilly? Electro? Hootie  the Rockabilly Electro? I was anxious with curiosity.      It was noisy and cacophonous. They were experimental: the drummer made screechy scratchy noises by scraping his drumstick in circles on the riding cymbal and he'd sometimes drum with the stick end of a maraca. The bassist played classical bass with a bow and when he'd switch off with electric, he played a fretless. But over all this avant garde ART sound, the singer crooned in a weirdly high, angelic voice. I loved it! I love shit like that.. experimental art school shit that's serious and frankly, NEW. Well, new to me. I don't come from an art school background, and I don't listen to John Cage, so I don't know what's what. But I can tell you what I like, and Dead Science, I LIKE! Thank you Kevin Arnold.    Wrens  -- Thank you Kevin Arnold. The Wrens were unbelievable. They're four guys that must be in their 40s, so I was skeptical if I'd like them. When I think of old rockers, I think of Fleetwood Mac or Bruce Springsteen, neither of whom I care for. The only 40s-ish band I like is The Cure, and they're established. They've been putting out records since the late 1970s. The Wrens rocked it like The Replacements. Great tunes, great post-punk fast, crazy guitar playing, great harmonies, and the best part: the moves!   The main guy had a lot of moves like pointing, and jumping, and he even flung his bass guitar over the audience but it jerked back to him because he'd hung onto the guitar strap. I gasped, I laughed, I clapped. What a great live show! And even though it was so energetic and dynamic, they did a lot of somber unmic'd singing too. The audience was enraptured and perfectly quiet so we could hear everything.  So intimate. And so risky too. I remember through Azure Ray's set a couple months ago, the audience talked the entire time. There was an annoying  chattery din throughout their set. Not so with The Wrens. I didn't want their show to end. I couldn't get enough.   Another highlight was this exchange: Singer: We've all been living in the same house since '91...  Audience: (Dead silence.) Singer: C'mon, I know. (Motions for the inevitable heckling.) It's sad, huh? Audience dude #1: That's Sad! Singer: You're probably wondering why we're not better. Guitarist: (walks up to his mic) I just had a date last year. Audience dude #2: God bless the internet!  All in all, Noisepop was a wonderful week in music. New bands to be excited about, new CDs to listen to, a bright new future on the rock horizon {shimmer, shimmer}. The best part was having people to share it with and be just as jazzed as me: W-gal  R-dude who showed on 3 nights and my cousins-in-law P-diddy  Big Bob at The Stills. No, the absolute best part of Noisepop were the turkey tacos that W-gal made before The Stills. I think that's what made the music so good: fuckin homemade turkey tacos. RAWK!
