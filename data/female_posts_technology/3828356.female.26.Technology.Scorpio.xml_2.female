She was orange, white, black, and tabby, all in one, with this loud, whining mewl. And cute!!  Well, my  urlLink cousin , Janine, is going to be moving into our old house that we've been renting. And, she has a cat, Salut (I think that's how you spell it?). She has been pondering finding company for her, as she is sometimes gone on weekends, and it can be a long, lonely time for a cat.   When this little one came bounding out of the grass towards me, with no tag or owner, I immediately gave her a call. After 2 minutes of hemming and hawwing, she said she'd take her, if we didn't mind babysitting for a couple of weeks, until she moved up to Saskatoon at the end of the month.  Let me say this. It has been an interesting week with a new kitty in the house. Our two cats, ZoomZoom and Ruby, have NOT been keen on this at all. There has been much growling, hissing, and gnashing of teeth, so to speak. Callie, as Janine has named her, seems pretty much oblivious. She just goes about her business, exploring her new home to be, eating, sleeping, and tormenting her babysitters. Wait...did I say tormenting her babysitters???   Yes, she likes to crawl up on our bed at, oh, say 4 in the morning, and lick. Lick, lick, lick. Lick the face, lick the nose, lick the lips (YUCK!!), lick the fingers! I try to push her away...she comes back...I swear, she could be a door-to-door salesperson with the persistence that she displays!   Tonight, I had to give her a bath. She was outside (we have a cat run attached to this house), and I kind of sprayed her a bit with the sprinkler. She was muddy, so I put her in the bath tub. Surprisingly, she did pretty good with it! No hissing or scratching. Now, I'm not saying she LOVED it, but she did pretty darn good.  As much as I love this little kitty, though, I'm going to be happy when Janine comes up here and takes ownership. I think her ears and nose need a good licking instead of mine. =)  -J.
