Old order is bound to change giving place to new. The human society needs a new meaning to life and a new system. Incarnations like Rama and Krishna had brought about such transitions through wars. War is the culmination of a divine drama where the heroes of truthfulness are ultimately victorious. This macro role of the spiritual powers is going to be enacted in a more perceptible manner in the days to come. All of us understand the meaning of a war. Let us then pray to Him to have mercy. Let us pray to Him to bring about a better order where human beings and other species can live happily together.
