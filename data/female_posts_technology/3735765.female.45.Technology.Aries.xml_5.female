I will be sharing these posts with you on the upcoming posts.  I hope that you will enjoy and share the excitement that I felt as I embarked upon this new journey! :))      HOROSCOPE, Thursday, May 22:   Your style may be a alittle fast and loos for timid bystanders.  The Stars let you move easily through the world without regrets or restrictions.   Your views of the moment could be totally different tomorrow.  This is what I am expecting from the trip in a sense.  Actually, I have no real expectations; therefore, I leave a lot of room for excitement  very little for disappointment!  I am so very looking forward to this trip!! There is a glimmer of hope for my cousin  - she is beginning to respond to the sound of her husband's voice last night!! I'm thinking that this [following] prayer might be nice to use if asked:   O God of love, we pray thee to give us love:  love in our thinking, love in the hidden places of our souls;  love of our neighbors, near and far ; love of our friends, old and new; love of those whom we find it hard to bear, and love of those who find it hard to bear with us; love of those with whom we work, and love of those with whom we take our ease; love in joy, love in sorrow; love in life and love in death; that so at length we may be worthy to dwell with thee, who art eternal.  Love, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, for ever and ever.  Amen.  -- William Temple (1881-1944) The following is just a great imagery:  "Imagine life as a game in which you are juggling five balls in the air.  You name them - work, family, health, friends, and spirit are made of glass.  If you drop one of these, they will be irrevocably scuffed, marked, nicked, damaged, or even shattered.  They will never be the same.  You must understand that and strive for balance in your life."  -- Brian Dysonn, CEO of Coca Cola Enterprises from 1959-1994
