(Does the name MOORE sound familiar.) 3.)For the events that happened that day to be used as political and manipulative device for retaining or obtaining power.   Response to #2: If Michael Moore was ANY kind of man, he would be donating every single penny of is his lying movie to charities for the victims of 9/11 and their descendants.   Response to #3: Did anyone notice how 9/11 is THE BASIS for the Kerry campaign thus far? That Michael Moore associates himself the same party seems me to be a negative association for Kerry at this point. If I were him, I would distance myself from him as much as possible.   With these points in mind, it is my opinion (not that you asked) that Kerry is not what is defined as a "Good Man".
