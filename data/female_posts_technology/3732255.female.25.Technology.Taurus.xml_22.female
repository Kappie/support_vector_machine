Fred's courage and hard work has been an inspiration to everyone, but he's just not physically up to the challenge of touring. There are no hard feelings on the part of anyone, we're all just thankful for the last three years of playing together and the fact that Fred's alive. Best of luck to Fred in his continued recovery and pursuit of musical excellence, he will always be part of the Tiger Army family." Mike Fasano, who drummed on the band's latest album III: Ghost Tigers Rise has graciously agreed to step in for the shows on this summer's Warped Tour, which begin this week.
