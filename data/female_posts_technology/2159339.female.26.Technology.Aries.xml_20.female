Dee-OW) show, Abby said that she looked online at the lyrics and that there were some that were a bit odd. What was odder was the unofficial "Who Wants to be Abby's Husband Contest" at the show. During M-Diao's set there was this one smashed fellow in a brown leather jacket who jumped right in front of Abby ("the husband arena") and did some wild uncontrollable dancing. He did this move I dubbed "The Geyser" where he would crouch down low low during the verse and when the chorus kicked in, he would jump up to full height, fist shooting up in the air.   Once he danced out of the space in front of Abby, a second contestant entered. This one was a young geeky jock, all peach fuzz and XXL tee. I think there was a baseball cap involved too. He grinned ridiculously and flailed his lanky limbs. Abby couldn't decide which to choose so I chose for her: Bachelor #1 for "The Geyser" because everytime she says "Yeah!" or "Alright!" he will do "The Geyser" to punctuate her enthusiasm. In fact, they can do it together. In fact, I may even join them every once in a while. Yeah!
