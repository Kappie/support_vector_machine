Thank God I'm jewish. I think that if I were to do something horrible during the set-up when it comes time for the trial that I could claim instanity because of Zionism. I only mention it because I remember a few years back there was an incident of a man who had stabbed his daughter to death over the decoration of their christmas tree. lord knows I've felt that way especially when mom has wanted to shove a freakin tree into my car when I had a perfectly fine roof rack to put the F*ckin tree on.  Other than that days have been rolling on - alcohol soaked as ever. Especially when eurotrash is involved. After this is all passed on I don't know if I'm going to remember what happened or has been happening these past few month.   - There is a new bar in my flat now. Its looking more and more like a bordello every day. Either that or a speakeasy. I've been considering becoming a madam. I mean...hell! why the fuck not. I got a house of men, all of them eligible and very good looking, and I know a growing pool of girlfriends who are always complaining about how it seems like there are no good men "left."   Actually that idea is probably not something I should honestly be considering with any seriousness. Although I won't lie, the idea is enticing. If only to keep the upper-hand on all my "mens"    *Quietly giggling to herself*
