"Regulator is to come from left or from right again? "  "PPppppsssss... What is that? Is my tank leaking? "*panic* "Hello!!! I think my tank is leaking!"   "Oh man.. Why is it the tube to my BCD doesnt fix in nicely? "*tries again and again* "Hello!! I think there is something wrong with my BCD.. the tube doesnt fix into it..."   My mask looks like it is goin to snap, got a replacement with an attached snorkel. Gosh!! There was algae all over. I refused to get into the water until i scrubbed it clean.. I went over to the common wash areain attempt to clean it.Eekks!! i think the algae has sunken its roots to the core of the silicon. *sigh* Have to make do with it. *gulp*"WHY ME??!!"   Sat 24/7/2004 1230hrs : Finally all rigged up. Wentto the shore for my entry.  Goodness!! IT WAS sooooDIRTY!! It was as if i was walking into the bowl of seaweed soup! Only that is was green and murky. There were floatingseaweed everywhere. Man!! i am DISGUSTED! G.R.O.S.S.   Sat 24/7/2004 1240hrs : Everyone struggled into the water. We commenced class.   Revised mask clearing and emergency air sharing. Hmm.. noticed that my buddy has improved somewhat.   Man.. Saw fishes!! It was as if I was in a HUGE fish tank. Where the jetty was, there was this huge shoal of kuning. *gasp* There must have been at least a thousand little fishes. I was exhilarated!   Sat 24/7/2004 1400hrs : Class ended. Clumsily walked out of the water and unrigged.   Sat 24/7/2004 1405hrs : Had a pretty good lunch. Gosh. The sambal sotong was solid!   Sat 24/7/2004 1410hrs : Hmtan persuaded me we should try some local fare after he caught a glimpse of the most delicious looking goreng pisang.   Sat 24/7/2004 1411 hrs : Decided not to, cos thosewere unwanted carbs   Sat 24/7/2004 1412 hrs : Lost to my evil self. What the heck! Let's jus eat!! :)   Sat 24/7/2004 1415 hrs : Bought and ate the most gorgeous goreng pisang. Note --> it was G.O.R.G.E.O.U.S.   Sat 24/7/2004 1445 hrs : Was sitting around Fishermen and was observing the divers.   And my attention was drawn to the common washing area. People simply huddle around the area. And to my HORROR, I saw someone stuck his feet into the water for a quick wash. *puke* All of us clean our equipment there, like our regulator, snorkel, etc. I MUST HAVE INDIRECTLY kissed a thousand feet *VOMIT* i felt the pisang turned in my stomach.   Sat 24/7/2004 1500 hrs: Couldnt get over the disgust. But it was time for my Second dive. Went further out the sea. Saw a lot of dead corals. Felt a little sad. Not to mention disgusted with thedirty-feet-contaminated regulator in my mouth.   Sat 24/7/2004 1545 hrs: They taughttowing. 2 types. Pull / Push.  Pull involves the tow-er to fin on the back and drag the tow-ee on his/ her back.  Push involves the towee to put his/her fins on the shoulders of tow-er and the tower simply kicks on the front.   Oh man!!  Push tow was so awkard for me.No explanations needed for this.It is juserm*duh*   Anyway,buddy was too weak. He feels tired after every 10 kicks. I ended towing him 3/4 of the way."Think it was a blow to hisego."   We went out further. Dive to abt 6-7 m deep. Saw almost nothing. Only white coarse sand. The coralswe saw were dark grey. And very few small fishes. Disappointed.   Sat 24/7/2004 1630 hrs: Class ended. We struggled back on shore. I asked Matt (Dive Master) if the corals we are going to see are all going to be like that. His reply was that there is no sun. Essentially the corals will need the sun to reflect its colours.    *really??!!*       Sat 24/7/2004 1700 hrs: Shower.  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!! Awful tan line. I was wearing a short suit and now i have 1. arm line 2. shorts line 3. bootie line. Nooooooooooooooo.. Not 1 awful tan line, but 3!!   Sat 24/7/2004 1900hrs: Met the rest up for dinner. Went to this Chinese restuarant for pretty good Chinese food. :) Saved stomach space for Ramly burger.   Sat 24/7/20042000hrs: Ramly was closed. Darn. They went for coffee and ice cream. My evil twin stole 2 spoonsful of ice cream and pancake from HMTAN and OKW.   Sat 24/7/2004 2100hrs: Met at Fishermen for test. It was an open book test. But guess what, they left all of us in the room unattended. We did what university taught us best. COPY! *hahahah*   Sat 24/7/2004 2145hrs:  Had 50/50 ! cool! hahah so much for studying huh??! Was told to meet at 7 am for our open water dive tomorrow. *SHOCKED*   Sat 24/7/2004 2200hrs: Washed up and zzzzzzzzz   Sun 25/7/2004 0645hrs: Saudi woke us up. Washed up andquickly left. (Saudi was one of my roommate. Stout funky gungho gal, attending the course with a girly chick, Yvonne. Saudi had a tatoo on her back. *ouch*mmmmm....)   Sun 25/7/2004 0705hrs: On the boat, human-chained the bags AND the TANKS on board.  oh man the TANKS!!   Sun 25/7/2004 0715hrs: Off to Rengis!   Sun 25/7/2004 0730hrs: Giant stride entry. WWWHHhhhhheeeee..  Dive to 9 m depth.. Man!!   Sea Urchin colony. Couldnt land. Kept finning. Followed the Matt everywhere. Kept hitting everyone. Everyone was doing the same. Everyone was slamming into each other and trying to stay afloat so as not to end up as a sea urchin needle pillow! It was hilarious.   Highlight of this dive: I saw Nemo's cousins! They were hiding in some wavy corals. Matt kinda poked at some corals and I saw 2 heads popped out.. They were so cute. *clap clap clap*  Idare not touch them thinking i might end up hurting them.   Saw plenty of small colourful fishes. Some which i can recall off hand were neon blue, some geen, some neon pink, and some zebra stripped fish.   Sun 25/7/2004 0820hrs: Out from the waters. Climbed on board. Cool stuff!!   Sun 25/7/2004 0830hrs: Breakfast was disappointing. Some fusion Malaysian-Tioman-US pancake with Honey. *puke* But i was hungry, so it will do for now.   Sun 25/7/2004 0910hrs: Second dive site. Soyak! Depth of 10.5 m. Cool stuff. I swam in a school of fish. Not sure what its name was. And i was told after i came out of the water that i had a sucker fish nibbling at my bootie all the time. *hahaha* I was a swimming happy meal. At least i knew between the 2 of us that one of us is fat/fed and satisfied.   Well, the corals still appeared mostly dull grey. SoMatt's theory dun hold.So much for the sunlight reflecting the corals huh?! *duh*   Sun 25/7/2004 1030hrs:Surface from my lastdive. Climbed out from the sea.We unrigged and was busily packing whenMatt told us togather upstairs.   Sun 25/7/2004 1035hrs:GRADUATION JUMP.   Mattwanted us to dive from level 2 of the boat into the open sea as to celebrate our graduation!! heheheh.I was contemplating to do abackward front flipdive to impress the entire cohort. But oh well, humility took over. I did a simple plunge and won a round of applause!  :o)   Sun 25/7/2004 1220hrs:Packed my bags and gathered onboard.  We are taking the dive boat all the way to Mersing. *GOSH* As it is a huge boat, itcouldnt go as fast as the speed boat. It will be traveling slow and steady. Estimated number hours of travel --> 4 hrs! My jaw dropped.   Sun 25/7/2004 1235hrs:Lunch. Some packed fried rice with egg. Not fantastic but edible.   Sun 25/7/2004 1305hrs: Logging our dive in the dive log..   I hear Matt's voice in the backgrd..  Remember what i said abt moving vehiclealmost 100% equates to sleep. It happened again. I totally dozed off.Not surehow long, but i felt someonesnug at my dive log.OKW took the dive log and helped me fill in the details. *thankie you*  Iwas in la la land. I was swimming admist sucker fishes nibbling away from my regulator as they like the feet contaminated taste. *gulp* *puke*   Sun 25/7/2004 1505hrs: Brother 2.   I was awakened by laughter. hmtan, okw, ckaren and one of her friends were in a game of Brother 2!! I joined in. Man. I think Feng-shui for me was terok! I lost 7/12 games. The odds were against me. I decided to open the door to change the wind(feng). And guess what. I still lost!! hahaha so it has nothing to do with Feng-shui!   Sun 25/7/2004 1610hrs: Arrived in Mersing.  Think they found their conscience. They actually said, "Ladies can stand aside while the men helped with the bags" I think they have lost their marbles in the Tioman. But what the heck! Oh rapture! No heavy diving equipment mesh bag for me.. WHooohooo!!   Sun 25/7/2004 1620hrs: Horror! One of our buses had a broken air con. They have decided to drop us of at sme Chinese resturant for an early dinner while they attempt to change a new big bus for us.   That was their story. But i was thinking that the bus company must have been paid commission to bring tourists to the resturant. Cos i heard that they have been encountering problems everytime they go back. "First to arrive in Mersing and last in Singapore." *duh* Change the bus company??!!   But lunch wasnt all too bad. Had a seafood feast for 10 pax for only RM 180! It was almost FREE!! hahaha.. not to mention, my EVIL twin returned. I had no part in the raveneous gorging! * sheepish look *   Sun 25/7/2004 1710hrs: The bus convieniently arrivedto drop another cohort of tourists to pick us up. (Man!! dun these people seeit?)It was a luxurious bus! Plenty of leg room.   Sun 25/7/2004 1720hrs: Brother 2 continues. We figured an ingenius way to form a table. We turned a back pack the other way where the back faces the sky and hooked the shoulder strap to the arm rest to form a table. 4 of us OKW, HMTAN, CKAREN and myself played the trip away!!   Sun 25/7/2004 2100hrs: Arrived in JB.   Heading towards the checkpoint. All the pushing and hussling. Cleared the Malaysian immigration. Was walking with my buddy amidst the crazy weekend JB crowd to look for our bus.  Spotted the bus. Was impossible to cut thru the crowd...Hmm.. Saw a little opening from the bus platform. And i suggested to my buddy why dun we quickly cut across from the bus platform. And we did.  Next,we heard a series of honks!! And saw plenty of angry bus drivers raising their hand, questioning what the hell we are doing...?   Man, we could have been killed. I mean what a shame it would be to tell pple u died on the way back from JB to Singapore from a diving trip to Tioman. I took off and buddy followed. We dashed to our bus! HONK !! HONK!!"  Sun 25/7/2004 2130hrs: Had to carry the dive bag cross the Singapore immigration! *huff puff* Man!! My arms are breaking!!!   Sun 25/7/2004 2140hrs: Byes everyone, not a bad trip at all!! See yaa!!!    I made it there and back alive!   :o)
