I've never had this much time before!  Ju had a little mini birthday party/ movie night for me.  I got HUGE a print of Matisse's   urlLink Icarus  (my favorite of the  Jazz  series) and beautiful planted purple flowers and my chip came from Je, it was originally her 3 year chip.  Dad sent me flowers this morning and they came with a little teddy bear and a box of chocolate.   Needless to say, I am feeling quite the spoiled princess tonight and am off to sleep as a very happy girl.  A year ago, I never though I would have the people in my life that I do now, and I never thought the people that wouldn't be in my life would leave.  Through the seemingly good and the seemingly bad, change always happens and its up to me whether I fight it or accept it.
