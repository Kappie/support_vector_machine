I saw 2 not 1 but 2 Budweiser trucks… they were huge.. I mean I live in a pretty small town where buses, taxis, and trucks are not very common… so now I’m thinking where could these 2 trucks made their dump.. then it hit me ..hello my office building it's right accross the street.. it’s huge.. thousands and thousands of people work there… and we have a huge café with a wall of reach in freezers ready to dispense soda, bottled water, and thirst quenchers…I wonder if they started carrying beer…how awesome would that be… I’d be in heaven… well soon enough the light turned green and reality hit.. “I DON’T DRINK DOMESTIC BEER” (sorry Budweiser) …   Question of the Day:  What your favorite type of beer?   I prefer an ice cold Heineken or a Corona with a lemon..(that’s lemon…not lime..i want the yellow stuff)…. and if I’m in a real feisty mood I can even do Killians.
