It impressed me that he chose to connect with people by using familiar terms.  I'm also equally impressed that he balanced the idea of working towards this freedom with caution regarding the path that is taken to reach that freedom.  Some groups will use any means to achieve their goal, which at times defeats the purpose and makes them like those they oppose.
