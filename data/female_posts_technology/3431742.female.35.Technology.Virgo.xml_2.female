I really recommend it for everyone!  Next season (sept '04 - may '05) is going to be really cool.  It will open with The Hunchback of Notre Dame and end with The Flute.  Either way the costumes and dancing will just make me gush with great pride that we have such a terrific ballet.  I'd like to see a show in NYC one day.  I also love dressing up for such events.  Sometimes it's a drag but I mostly enjoy it.  Memorial weekend coming and I get tomorrow night and Sunday to myself.  I get to be with the babies the whole time.  I kinda can't wait.  I don't know what it is but I just can't wait to be home and have them around me.  I love it most when they chase each other and to calm down they come by me for some lovin'.  They then crash on me but I love it all.  Love having them purr and holding their head or paws in my hand as they fall asleep.  It's so awesome!  I think I'm having trouble with the word awesome tonight.  I haven't even had any booze either!!    Summer is coming and so are alot of events.  I'm a bit excited about that too.   Ok this is getting lengthy.  Ponder this batman:  If there was one event you could take back, what would it be and why?
