If I check my statistics vs. theirs I almost always seem to be doing twice as many tickets in the same time frame. Granted, phone support takes longer than email and everyone has thier own pace...*shrug*.  Jasmin had ANOTHER fiasco at day camp today. That's two incidents in two days, not a good sign. I know she doesn't take change well but I'm also really not sure if her meds are working. If this continues I'll have to ask my parents to watch her during the week or something. I think having to spend four hours at work with me was punishment enough for today.   When Jasmin and I got home Jeff just happened to be driving by as we were getting out of the car. He pulled over and invited us for ice cream! Ok, so he more invited Jasmin than me, is that weird? My friend D tells me he might like me but I think he likes Jasmin more. I dunno, but it doesn't feel like a phony "be nice to the kid to get with the mom" thing, so I'm content.
