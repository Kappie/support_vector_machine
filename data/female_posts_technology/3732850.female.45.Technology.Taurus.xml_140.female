If you're not aware what time period Mary Cassatt lived in, quotes from the first paragraph help you to define the period. "I would rather see you dead", her father said of her decision to become a painter. Even painter Degas said, "I am not willing to admit that a woman can draw that well".      The author continues she talks about the "paradoxes of the woman artist",what Mary would have to overcome and the things she had going for her.The time period is mentioned when Mary's mother dies and you understand even more the issues that Mary faced. Even after 28 years abroad as a "renowned Impressionist painter" a Philadelphia newspaper said, "She has been studying painting in France and owns the smalles Pekingese dog in the world."      They down played her renown, nothing was mentioned about all the famous painters who esteemed their female colleague.
