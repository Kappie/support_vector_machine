When I wake up  weigh myself it's about 170 - 173lbs .. and then later in the day it'll be 175. How does a person put on 10lbs. in a week .. or in like 3 days?! What is going on?  I need to get a new scale but this scale is accurate (my sis is consistently 110 - 115lbs so I use her to test it). I wish I could be closer to that .... 120lbs - 125lbs. is THE perfect weight for my height but I'm trying to be realistic here.  This is what I ate today .. wasn't much, I'd think Breakfast - pancakes, small (3/4) with maple syrup (little), ice cream (1/4 cup) Lunch - protein shake Tea - stir fry Chinese noodles (1 cup, max) Dinner - chicken sandwich (using white bread  sandwich meat), some mayo  lettuce (1 sandwich) Snacks - Viennese butter cookies (3 x 40cals), raisins (1 tiny/small box), satay fish (3/4 pkt)  No workouts but did make a little hike at the building site of the house. I'll probably do some weight training (arms) in awhile. My legs still ache from the workout I did 2 days ago.   I need to improve on my diet. Absolutely NO cookies anymore! And drink more protein shakes .. like replace both lunch  dinner. I really don't need all those calories.
