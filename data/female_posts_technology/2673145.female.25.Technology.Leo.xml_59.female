Sis came home from her US biz trip and I bought a Victoria's Secret top from her. It's funky enough to be my CNY clothes.   The old home computer is not working again. (sigh) I hope it'll be fix after playing around with the CMOS setup: its not booting from the HDD. I can't wait to retire it. It has been almost 5 years and had gone through a few replacements and upgrade. It's time is coming...  With CNY (Chinese New Yr) round the corner, weekends were spent cleaning, frying, making snacks and tibits. I am so looking forward to Wed where I'll have reunion dinner with family, doing the usual ritual of drinking and stuffing ourselves with the steamboat dinner. Followed by manicure and pedicure in our pjs and receiving "ang pao" (red packet) from my lovely parents. $_$ I've missed this ritual for 2 years. This year, the whole family is driving to Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur and the nearby Mountain resort - Genting Hillands (for casino) during the coming long wkend. Hope it'll be fun.  I've just decided! My CNY resolution is to get rid my extra fats before the next CNY! Muahhaa!! (^o^)
