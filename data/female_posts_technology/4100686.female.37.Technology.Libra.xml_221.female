Have you read about Hitler and the rise of Facism ? Well this is American-style facism, there is no other word for it. Things have been building like this for many years. After getting defeated in Vietnam the U.S. facists climbed into a hole and hid for a while, but now they are back and more organized. They are much more organized then the left is willing to admit. It is frightening.  The main thing about American facism is that violence and murder is projected to other countries, like Iraq right now. They can't do it here YET.. but Bush and his gang want to. They despise democracy, freedom... what they worship is money. It's that simple - money.  Americans have protested this war and occupation in hundreds of ways.  But the major media won't cover it, or if they do they label us as "extremists", or call us "anarchists and terrorists". Bush and Kerry ignore the anti-occupation movement..  If a tree falls in a forrest and no one hears it, does it make a sound ?  Peaceful protest is ignored, and so what do people turn to ? Well , it seems many in Iraq have chosen violent resistance - who I am to argue with them ?  I hope you mom feels better, and do what you have to do to protect yourself.
