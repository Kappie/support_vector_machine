New neighbors upstairs.  Not liking them all too much as I don't enjoy listening to them hang pictures above my bedroom at 10 at night.  We'll have to see how it goes.  The apartment has been a disappointment in so many ways.  I love the feel it has, I love the inside however we are going on almost 3 weeks with no cable and no sign of it.  I am tired of the landlords excuse and honestly the whole thing is taking on the appearance of a joke.  *sigh*
