I believe I'll just up and post a chapter a day at a new fanfiction blog that I'm making, while at the same time putting up one at fictionpress.net. Most of these are all fanfiction ones, but they don't have anything to do with Star Fox in some of them, it just takes place in that universe. So I consider much of it original fiction. Ha! So there!    Other random thoughts:    It's actually warm outside, now that it's July! I bet we won't get rain for a good two months, like it was last year. Damn drought.
