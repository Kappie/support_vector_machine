    
       Knowing how to fight to the very end, yet having the wisdom  to give up on a spent cause  Flowing quickly like a stream, yet having the ability to slow down and pause  Expanding - growing like a cloud, yet knowing boundaries of where to stop  Loving caring and forgiving yet knowing when to give in no more.
