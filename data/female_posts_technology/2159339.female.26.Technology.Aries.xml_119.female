I'm usually up by then anyway (sometimes as early as 6), but it's a whole different ballgame having to drive all the way to Hunters Point and be creative for 5 hours while trying not to poke myself with pins. Luckily, Derek the instructor know all this, so we watch a runway show for 20 minutes to get 'warmed up'. Then it's back to dress forms, pleats, flares and my personal favorite, apexes. When he talks about mannequin boobs, he makes little circles around the nipples of his dress form as Katherine and I try to contain our laughter.  That's because we're in love with him. No, it's not a seam ripper in my pants, I'm happy to see you, my sexy fashion deity. He knows that to be truly creative, one needs inspiring music in the background. So he puts on Madonna's Like a Virgin Tour video and I don't need caffeine anymore (last week it was Janet Jackson, another excellent choice).    After my class, I stop by my parents' house. Mumsy is terrified that I will die on my trip to the Grand Canyon this weekend. I quote Dr. Phil and tell her she's only scared because she doesn't know anything about backpacking or the GC. Let's go online and I'll show you. Bad idea. Mom doesn't bother to read the small print so, instead, she looks at the photo of a man dying of dehydration and the words "Don't Let This Happen To You" written above the photograph. She gasps and starts beating Alex (my dad) with a newspaper, screaming "It's all your fault!! She got this stupid idea from you!!" (in russian it sounds much more dramatic). Alex and I laugh because the only time we bond is when we conspire to torture my poor mother. "Maybe it'll be icy enough that I can just slide all the way down", I say. My mom's eyes sadden as she looks at us, her tormentors. "If you freeze, you won't have to hike up" he says. We laugh some more. "Oh, for fuck's sake, get over it. It'll be fine. Millions of people go every year. And thousands come back. What's the worst thing that could possibly happen?" That's another cue for us to laugh...and for me to leave because I can feel an onset of a panic attack, being at my folks' place for over 30 minutes now. I sqeeze my mom tight and thank her for the food. "I'll be okay. I promise. I think."  So yes, the trip. I'm excited. Mostly because I spent $250 on gear this weekend. M  I put up my brand new tent in the living room when we got home and I made him hang out inside with me as I worked on the rubik's cube. We argued only 3 times this weekend, our record. One of those fights occurred because I revealed to him the very unflattering name I've been calling him to all my friends for the past 2 years. He got angry and I felt guilty, so I offered to drive him to Chinatown to take photos for his assignment. I hung out with homeless people near the playground as he took photos from the top floor of the Holiday Inn. I looked up every once in a while to see his flash go off in the sky.   Ok. I better go. The hair dye needs to be washed off and I have another ten hour workday tomorrow.
