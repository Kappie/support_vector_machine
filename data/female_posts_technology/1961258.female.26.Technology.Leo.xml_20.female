The lowest of lows. I need more weeks like that, just so I can get down to a lower weight. But it's progress and at least now I know I can do it. I'm hovering about 163 - 165lbs right now. On the digital scale it's reading about 76kg and 39% BF. Lovely.   But .. the past two days, I have been horrible. Eating 'right' again meaning 3 meals a day and an ice cream cone, chocs as treats. Gotta stop.   I was looking through MY old pictures. From my trips and such .. and I was struck with  how stupid  I completely was. There was this one time we took a trip to Bali, I can't recall the year but I did write at the back of the picture - 137lbs. and in all the pictures I fuzzed out my face with a pen, totally blacked it out. And also did these huge circles over my breasts, stomach and thighs and labelling them  fat, sausage thighs  or  huge thick stomach roll, gross!  and such things. I had such animosity for my body, it was unbelievable and when I look at that picture now .. I look so healthy and small. Although I think even though I am older, my face does look better now for some reason. Maybe I AM more comfortable with myself right now overall compared to then and it comes out.   But yes, I  want  to get back down to that weight and be able to fit into those short shorts. I need to wake up. I've been fat (above 150lbs) for the past 4 years. Coming up to 5 years. My highest weight was 175 (this January) and the lowest was 155 (early 2003), not counting the 145 that I started from back in late 2000. So yeah I don't want to be the fat girl any longer.   Time to take absolute drastic action. I think if I really hit it I CAN hit 150lbs (my goal for my challenge with my mom) by the end of July. And to definitely continue on after that until I get down to 145lbs, where I was before. Wish me luck.
