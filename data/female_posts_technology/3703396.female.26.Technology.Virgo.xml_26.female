I won't go into details as it is inappropriate, but I sure am glad it's passing gracefully.  I've been working on my husband's side of the genealogy recently, and have scanned in some  urlLink postcards  for people to enjoy.  They are mostly from Indiana and Ohio, postmarked between 1907-1919.  They are beautiful notes with original handwriting, family events, birthday wishes, and encouragements.  Quite a nice find for our family history!  Yesterday I took a little time to help a fellow genealogist in need of a gravesite photo.  She lives in Tennessee and needed some information from a cemetery here in Phoenix.  I took some pictures and got copies of the plot info and sent it to her.  It feels good to help a stranger when possible!  Then I had my very first Wilton I Course I cake decorating class at  urlLink JoAnn ETC  up at Desert Ridge.  It seems like it will be very fun!  I'm taking it with my neighbor Trudy, and I'm very glad she suggested it.  My friends Katie and Mike Peterson just left a few minutes ago, on their way back to Chicago.  They stayed with us overnight last night on the last evening of their trip to visit and catch up.  We chatted and reminisced, and played a really fun card game called Guillotine.  It was so much fun to play!  We haven't seen them in a few years and are very happy that they were able to squeeze us into their busy trip!  Thanks KT and Mike!!
