By incident, I mean a car wreck, a slip on the ice, moving something very heavy, etc.  Sometimes she'd need medical treatment but most of the time she would "tough" it out.    Well, in my over over-zealousness to workout and get in better shape, I've aggrivated my Sciatic nerve.  During a cool down after a tough 1 hour class, I was doing a  urlLink Cobra Yoga Pose .  It's a very simple move, and as you follow the link above, you'll see that it clearly states " Yoga exercise has no competition element".  Of course, during class, I was thinking....Wow.. I am so much more flexible than everyone else.  Woo Hoo.. I ROCK!    It has now been a couple days since the class, and my lower back is very sore.  I'm icing my back, elevating my legs, and taking ibuprofen.  The next time I'm in class, I'm not going to look around and see if I can stretch further than the others.  I need to listen to Monica (follow the workouts she's given me, and keep my food journal) and I'll succeed at losing the last 30lbs that I'm aiming to loose by year end.  Trying to "out-do" others isn't the way....
