Freedom is still doing good and life is just in general well, boringly wonderful. I have settled back into the corporate world without issue.   My latest review reads:   Shannon,  What can I say? Awesome performance! Your AHT  (average handle time)  is really low, which would normally worry me because it might mean that you're not giving the customer enough service to be thorough. However, I see that your ACW  (after call work)  time is also REALLY low (it's included in AHT), which means that you're talking and typing and this contributes to your low AHT. Also, in call monitoring, I haven't noticed you giving customers poor, or rushed service. Just be sure not to over-focus on indicators, so that you don't burn yourself out.  I'm so glad you're on the team!    Hope everyone is well!
