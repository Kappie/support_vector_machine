Unfortunately, the rest of the weekend weather wasn't conducive to two cute girls picking up guys in a convertible, but there's always the rest of the summer.  :)  Preds struggled Saturday, but Detroit came to town Sunday looking for a fight, and an actual  urlLink hockey game  broke out.    I thought I had managed to avoid the uncomfortable family holiday scene, but Mom decided to show up to meet me for church Saturday night with her (soon to be ex) husband.  I decided to make a quick visit to see her Sunday after her guests left Easter dinner and before he got home from the game, to confirm nothing like that would happen again (and scored some homemade raisin bread and a bottle of wine in the process!).  I was incredibly spoiled yesterday morning, with coffee, the Sunday paper, breakfast, mimosas and a bag of Easter presents.  Peach went all out to celebrate her free day!  And all I did was show up.  Next time, we need the sun to come out so we can sit on the deck.  Monday morning, back at work (although I don't feel like I had much of a break) after fighting the rain and the three accidents I had to avoid to get here.  Five more days 'til the weekend...
