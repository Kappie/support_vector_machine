Following is an actual apology note that was mailed to the bartenders at E after a particularily rowdy performance a couple of weeks ago by a girl who at one time was a regular.    Please note:  Her behavior was obviously uncalled for, but culminated in her throwing a beer bottle across the bar which hit the rail, bounced, then came to a smashing finish on the floor.   She was asked to leave immediately.   It wasn't me (I wasn't even there that night).   I've omitted her name, but she signed the note card.   "Wanted to write a note to apologize for my behavior at the bar on Friday. I do not know what came over me and I am not only sorry but embarrassed. I hope that we can forgive and forget and know that it was just a bad moment. Thanks." I think it's safe to say the guys may forgive her, but I doubt anyone is going to forget this any time soon...
