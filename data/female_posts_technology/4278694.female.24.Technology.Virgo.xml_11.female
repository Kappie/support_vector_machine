I've asked him to help me find out about writing groups, grants, putting a show together and performance opportunities.  I think with him helping, I might indeed be able to put together a show for next year.  Now if only I could figure out a way to get my picture up on my blog--they all would be good.      Here's today's Irish feature of the day from The Kerryman:       urlLink Rain Fails to Dampen Puckish Spirit       If you choose not to create an account in order to read the story, it's the top feature article of the day about a goat named Elivs that was chosen for the annual "Puck" festival.  But legend has it that if an all-white goat is chosen, it will rain.  Elvis was all white, and rain it did.  Next year, they're going to look for a goat of a different color.
