So I didnt get up at 2 I slept til 6 , then cleaned my ass off til 645 got dressed and was at work by 730.   I guess its not meant for me to get sleep. I am trying to sleep now cause when the kids start school I will not get any.   I will finish it today. Instead of going home and snuzzlling :-( I will have to clean. I have to get the refrigerator out of the house today!!!!!
