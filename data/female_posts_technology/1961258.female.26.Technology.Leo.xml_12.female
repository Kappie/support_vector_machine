I'm 165lbs now .. it's stagnating thank god. I guess this will always be my weight whenever I never really watch what I eat or exercise. It's my natural weight.   I went to Dorothy Perkins today (it's a British clothing store) and decided to try on some clothes. I took a pair of pants in Size 14, then a pair of jeans in Size 16 because I thought I'd be that big ...  Was I surprised to discover, that I'm really not that big. The Size 16 jeans were hanging way too loose, and they were hip huggers. Very good news for someone who has an hourglass figure - boobs, hips in proportion .. relatively smaller waist. Hip huggers are never good IF you have hips.   The Size 14 fit just right. I'm probably at the mid to high end range of Size 14, so within the month or two would like to get down to the low-end of Size 14 (155lbs?)  Then finally .. get down to a Size 12, my perfect size at about 145 - 148lbs.   Btw US sizes are either 2 or 4 down from UK sizes, depending on who you talk to. So .. a Size 14 UK is a Size 12 or 10 US.
