Disclaimer: I really do like men - provided they don't smoke, have a mullet - or kids by 3 different women.  But Boys have a huge capacity for losing all their intelligence when put in front of women.  It never fails to amaze my friends and I.     Rule #1 :  If I look at you and smile - you can come over.  I think you're cute and want to find out if you're charming.  Rule #2 :  If I look at you and don't smile - please don't come over.  I may be making fun of you.  Rule #3 :  If you offer to buy a girl a drink and she says, "no, thank you" - that is your cue to  go away .    Rule #4 :  If a girl smiles at you, leans in and asks, "So, what are you doing this weekend."  That translates to, "You are cute, so far haven't annoyed me too much - Ask me out".  Rule #5 :  Text messaging is  DUMB .  Pick up the damn phone.  Of course if you are lacking verbally, and will make a complete ass of yourself - don't call - go find a dumb girl.  Rule #6 :  If you are at a bar, and there are girls within ear- or even eye-shot, don't be a pig.  We can detect foul behavior at a distance, we don't need to hear it.  Rule #7 :  If you are on a date with a girl, and you are driving.  Don't order a drink unless she does.  Otherwise she'll label you as an inconsiderate moron.  Rule #8 :  While we are on the topic of inconsiderate morons: If there are girls standing at the bar, while you are sitting - ALWAYS offer up your seat to a standing lady.  This also correlates to opening doors, helping out of cars, not blowing your nose at the dinner table and not using your fingers to push your peas onto your fork before you put them into your mouth.  How old are you? - Three!?  Rule #9 :  Do Not - Do  NOT  wear white socks with black dress shoes.  Don't wear knee high socks (even pushed down) with shorts.  Don't wear socks with sandals in the summer (preferably never - but we can forgive you in the fall) - and do have more than white and/or black socks in your sock drawer.  Let's see some patterns, Gentleman.  Argyle socks are the classic choice.  Rule #10 :  Don't touch a girl unless she touches you first.  Nothing is creepier than a guy who assumes he can get inside your personal space without a direct invitation.  Okay - that's all :) I'll now step down off my soap-box.  I'm sure my friends would have more rules -  but these will do for now.  Ta-Ta, cutesox
