Stupid song, stuck in my head for the whole day. It was hot, but thankfully, for everyone concerned, no-one took their clothes off.  I'm not sure I'm ready for this immediate transition to summer, why I've still got the quilt on and am wearing the flannellette pyjamas! No wonder I keep waking up in a sweat.  This is why you have seasons, isn't it? Autumn to get you ready for winter and spring to get you ready for summer.  People underestimate the mental energy involved in a seasonal transition.  It's about the clothes, the food, the hair, the hair removal.  It's complex, that's why it's supposed to take three months!  As someone put it to me recently, the penguins clearly have stolen spring and are using it for their evil penguin ways somewhere in the Antarctic, or perhaps, on Granite Island.  Anyway, when the weather is the only thing you have to complain about, then life is pretty good.  And it is generally, except for the ridiculously huge crush I have on a boy at work.  Is it still a crush when you're 35?  Oh no! Maybe it's not! Maybe, technically, when you're 35, it's not a crush anymore, perhaps it's some weird obsessive, stalking neurotic turn by a bitter, unmarried woman?  Nah. It's a crush. I keep sighing a lot and moping about thinking up witty text messages to send..   ..and maybe driving past his house.  ...Or turning up unexpectedly with a cake - or a lasagne...or just phoning and then hanging up when he picks up the phone....    Does anyone know how much those night vision goggle things cost? Are they expensive?....
