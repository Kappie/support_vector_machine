He slowed and crouched for a moment, his feline green eyes glancing behind him as his pointed ears listened closely to the sounds.  A stick broke and the birds took off from the treetops overhead.  His slender form rose quickly as he raced perpendicular from the way he just came.  His graceful moves clearly showing he wasn't human in any sense of the word.  An elf is the only possible solution to his heritage.  The birds continued to chirp as he passed silently and quickly only to be quieted as the hunters continued to trail him.  In no possible terms did he regret his mission and yet it has been filled with conflict and strife.  He only wanted to find the remaining elves for he could not believe he is the last of his kind.  But if the elves had been hunted like he is being hunted then he had few doubts that many survived.   All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003
