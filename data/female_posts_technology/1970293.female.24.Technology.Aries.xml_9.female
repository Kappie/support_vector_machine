Sometimes yelling, sometimes fighting, keep a calm mind, keep a calm discussion  Sometimes you do things that hurt me terribly, I lash out to make you see, what you did to me.  Only love can hurt, don't you see, what you did to me, crying my heart out.  You grab me, scaring me, with your violence only to prove,  you love me  Never lie to me. Never betray me. For I will find out, Don't you see. Don't you see.  All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003
