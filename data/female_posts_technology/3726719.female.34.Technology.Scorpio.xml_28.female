A lot like dread, which can make a harmless thing seem like a miserably insermountable obstacle.  I definitely had some anticipation building up to my date with J.   The whole circumstance of how we met and started talking.  I never got nervous about it.  I definitely had high hopes for our evening.  And let me tell you...the evening did not disappoint!  First let me describe J.  He's 35, about 5'8", very short dark hair, deep brown eyes, and a flat out incredible physique.  It's obvious he pumps iron.  He's got a chest, shoulders, and arms that are just yummy!  :o)  And yes ladies, I did take the opportunity to check out his tush.....well yummy just seems to be the right word....and maybe the phrase "squeezably soft" cause it definitely looked it!  Oh, and don't let me forget to mention he's got the cutest dimples - when he smiles they are just adorable!  J arrived promptly at 6 in his burgundy colored Toyota Tundra king cab.  He came in for a minute to meet the cats, then walked me to the truck, opened the door for me, and made sure I was seated comfortably before shutting the door and walking around to get in the truck.  Fellas take note - it's very cool to open the door for a lady.  The chatting started instantly.   And took us all the way to the restaurant.   Here's another note for the fellas - if you think she looks nice, tell her....it will result in an even bigger smile.  We went to Blackstones in downtown Nashville for dinner.  The food was fabulous.  The drinks were excellent - I definitely recommend the chocolate martini!!   The best part was the company.  J is a funny and intelligent conversationalist.  I definitely didn't have to entertain myself - he did that for me.  It was a lot of fun getting to know him.  We both expressed how much we were enjoying each others company.  And J thoroughly enjoyed the fact that I have a sense of humor and am not afraid to use it!  I actually got him a couple times and evidently he's not used to that.  The coolest thing was J holding my hand.  I don't know what it is about hands with me.  I can still think back to the first time I noticed how moving, intimate, erotic, and loving hand holding could be.  When we were done eating dinner and still sitting and talking, J took my hand in his and it was just so comfortable.  We also had our fist kiss sitting there at the table.  :)   It was very sweet.  I know that word seems trite...it's just the only thing I can think of at the moment.  Needless to say J and I were very comfortable with each other.  Me being me I asked a bunch of nosey questions trying to find out his psycho factor.  He didn't mind a bit and I haven't yet found a psycho indicator.  So it's all good.  We ended up going back to my house to watch a movie (I had borrowed a few from the library and evidently The Score with Robert DeNiro is a manly kind of movie).   We did stop by the liquor store to pick up a bottle of vodka - J was willing to try a martini and I was willing to try the new French vodka.   That may have been a mistake, because my head still hurts this morning.  :)  I can tell you I don't remember any of the movie.  Turns out that not only does J like holding hands and cuddling, he's an excellent kisser!  So pretty much all  I remember from the rest of the evening is the kissing and the cuddling.  We fell asleep that way (fell asleep, passed out, whichever).  It was very cozy.  My apologies to J's dogs - they were probably not very happy this morning when he got home to let them out!!   Poor puppies.  I hope they don't hold it against me.  :o)  I am glad that J didn't drive after the vodka though.  Granted Mt. Juliet isn't far....just not worth the risk though.  Oh, as for when I will see J again?  Well, he wanted to come by this afternoon before this evenings date - yes he wants to mess with my mind and get an advantage over the next guy!  And there is potential for dinner at his house one night next week.
