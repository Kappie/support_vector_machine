I was introduced to one of the new biologists and as I went in to shake his hand, my thumb somehow ended up on the same side as my palm and it was a COMPLETE AND UTTER DISASTER. He even said 'Oh. I guess I'll shake your hand this way." In addition, my hands are cold  clammy, which always makes meeting new people an absolutely mortifying task because they  know   that my hands are clammy and as they're shaking, they're probably thinking "It's definitely NOT a pleasure to meet you'. I want to crawl under my desk and stay here until lunch and then crawl back afterwards with my new shoes. And here I had high hopes for today. I guess I'll have to get Ethiopian food and eat it on my bed while watching Dr. Phil to make me feel better.
