The "It" that will save you also, is wisdom.  (From a few lines above the start of this passage.)  While the learning Bible explains this in a much more literal way, the adulteress and wayward wife being unfaithful, immoral women who ignore their marriage vows or are prostitutes, the "land" being Israel, promised by God to descendents of Abraham, I can't relate things that way to my life.  So it makes more sense to me to view these passages in a more figurative way...  Don't let anyone draw you away from God with "seductive" words, things they say to make sinful things seem attractive and worth doing.  Have the wisdom to know what is right and to follow what God wants you to do.  Going down that path (of sin) leads to death, and no one who does that is going to have the eternal life promised by God.  Do what he wants you to do, be a good person, stick to the right path, and you'll have everything promised by God, including an eternal life with him in Heaven.  Don't do that, and you're basically screwed.
