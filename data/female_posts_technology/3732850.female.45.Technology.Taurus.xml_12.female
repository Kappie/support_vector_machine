I feel good when I help in my daughter's class room and just seeing her big smile and her being proud that I'm there to help. She is so proud to have me be there with her and the kids enjoy me being there.   I feel good when my kid's friends come over and are happy to see me and tell me that I'm one of the best parents they ever meet. They have fun being themselves, they laugh and do things over here that they can't do at home like have water fights in the house or outside, and yes I did say inside. There is one girl that loves being here. She lost her mom two years ago to cancer and she told me that she loves me as if I was her mom and that she feels that she can talk to me and that makes me feel good.   A couple days before Mother's Day, she asked me if she could get something for me on Mother's Day. I didn't know what to say and I did say that yes. There are no words how to descibe how proud that child felt. She's grounded for quite awhile and she calls and tells me she misses me and that no one understands her at home like I do. I'm glad that I can make a difference in a teenager's life.
