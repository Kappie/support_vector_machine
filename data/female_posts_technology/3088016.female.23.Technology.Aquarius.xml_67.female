Most kids can probably understand that for every action, notwithstanding whether it's a dare, there are consequences.  One high school Junior from my own state of Texas drank chemicals from his school's chemistry lab when his buddies dared him to.  Was there a thought process here?  How do you get to this kind of decision point and say "Yeah, I think that I should drink that unidentified chemical?"   urlLink The story  reports that he was found in the hallway, bleeding from the nose and mouth.  The kid is in stable condition now and will probably recover.  He can even talk again.  I wonder if it at least scored him the points with his friends that he was going for.   I don't know if I ever did anything in school to make my parents all that proud.  I do know that I never did anything like this.
