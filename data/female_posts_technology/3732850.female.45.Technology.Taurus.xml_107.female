She goes on talking of how she thought of him when ironing one night and how she'd like a wife for herself, meaning for someone to take care of her and run errands, keeep track of dental and doctor appointments, mend clothes, feed kids, arrange school events, take them to the park and so on.  While reading this essay, I found her repetition in wanting a wife mentioned over and over again. Things such as, "I want a wife to take careof my children," or "I want a wife who takes care of the children when they are sick," or "I want a wife who will take careof the babysitting arrangements or wanting a wife who is faithful, honest, entertains, and is a good cook.  This essay sounds like the woman is the jack of all trades and does more than a man has to. In the world today, this essay leaves the reader with false accusations. In the way wives nurture others, I find this si habit in being brought up. Today, roles have changes with the mother working and the father watching and raising kids. Today, it is whatever works out.  Some people are single parents, such as myself, doing the "Mr. Mom." Every household is different so this essay I find distracting.  It sounds like she is unhappy in her role of motherhood. I think, by nature, mothers are nurturers at heart. Most of us are. I believe some of it comes natural.  As a single parent, it is oberbearing at times but I love my kids. They have responsibility with helping when I haven't a spouse to rely on. Sometimes that would be nice. I've adjusted to the single parent role. I may not always like it but I do what I can.
