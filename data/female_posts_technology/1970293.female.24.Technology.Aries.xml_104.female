Morrigan snuggled close to Aidan and ate a piece of bread.  It was the last of the bread so they would have to scrouge tomorrow for something to eat.    Deep in her thoughts, she kept going over the lore in her mind to keep her craft strong within her.  Tomorrow she could feel that things were going to get rough for them either because they would have to find their food or the fact that they are finally entering the forest proper.  Suddenly she felt Aidan sit up quickly.  She blinked coming back to herself in a flash to find that someone had joined them in their makeshift camp.  She couldn't see in this darkness so she clicked her fingers and produced a small globe of light that floated in the middle.  "That's a neat and helpful trick, child."  The voice said quietly about the globe of light.  Morrigan took a close look at their guest.  She noticed the way the stranger sat on the ground with his legs crossed in a relaxed manner.  She glanced at the long silvery blond hair and the pointed ears poking through the strands and the feline eyes that stared at her.  "My lord."  She nodded her head to show her respect.  "My name is Morrigan and this is Aidan.  Please forgive us for traveling through your forest without your permission."  The elf nodded in reply.  "Under the present circumstances, one can understand why you had to flee to this forest.  I also know that you are a child of the forest so I know you understand many of our ways even if you do not have the power or connection like we have.  Please continue through the forest though remember to be careful.  I will warn the pranksters to leave you alone of course that doesn't mean they won't come out and talk to you continuously until you wish for death just to have silence once more.  We will speak later when you have reached your destination.  If you continue through the forest, you will find a small cabin that you may use for now.  Fare thee well until then."  Morrigan blinked and elf disappeared from view.  She clicked her fingers again and distinquished the small globe.  "That was an elf, right?"  Aidan asked quietly in her ear.  "Oh yes, that was an elf.  It appears we have been given shelter for now though I have no idea why."  Morrigan snuggled closer to Aidan.  He squeezed her tight as he whispered, "At least we can feel somewhat safe now and sleep sound if we like."  Morrigan didn't make a sound for she had already fell into a deep sleep.  Aidan soon followed her into dreamland.    Eyes appeared in the brush and quiet rustlings ruffled the bush.  "Shhh, don't wake them."  A quiet voice said as a form took shape from the tree beside the sleeping couple.  "Sorry."  Whispered a small gnome who was moving into a better position to keep watch for the night.   Maybe I should point it out to him
