I,ROBOT ROCKS!!!!!! So far definitely the best movie of the summer.  It's a cross between Matrix, Lord of the Rings, and a Roller Coaster ride. All with Will Smith. And can I just say thank you for the butt shot!!! :o)  The movie was just excellent. Early on it seemed the story line was going to follow a predictable path...nope. Okay, Casandra probably would have seen it coming.....but the rest of us "normal" people would and did get a pleasant little twist at the end. Nothing major - definitely some added entertainment though.  I will definitely be seeing this movie again. And it's a must have for the DVD collection.  Oh, and for those of you looking for Oscar caliber performances and story lines to challenge even Tolkien.....lighten up...it's a summer action movie and it exceeds those expectations! ;)
