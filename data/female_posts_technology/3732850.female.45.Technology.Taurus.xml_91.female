Reading this story is like other's I've read and it make me cringe to think that someday I may need this type of attention. I am glad that my mother, because of alzheimer's, didn't know where she was when we put her in a home. I'm also thankful that I never had to do that with my father. This story definately makes me think of my future and how I would like it to be shaped and what I will do about that while I can.
