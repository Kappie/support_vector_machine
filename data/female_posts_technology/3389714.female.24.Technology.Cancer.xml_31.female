I’ve had many friends swear on the “Wicked Witch of the West’s Grave” that they did speak to me around 2:00am EST…however I can’t seem to remember them calling or what we talked about…usually they say that I told them I’ll call them back tomorrow…or I’ll answer their questions…then hang up…this is a freighting issue cuz what if someone calls starts asking me about my deepest darkest secrete's…which I don’t think I have but maybe I do sub-consciously and I suppress them cuz their so horrid…I mean the human psyche is a complicated thing… I never talk in my sleep unless someone talks to me and starts asking me stuff.. I never voluntarily talk ..i need to voice record what I say…what if it not me talking what if it a spirit that takes over my body in the evening…so the person talking to you on the phone is not me but some dead person that was murdered by their concubine. and now he’s out for revenge and he’s using my body at night ..ahhh…way to creepy…anyways ..for all u guys out there that I’ve accused for not calling and I’m greatly sorry…but hey u have to admit I do sound cute when I’m ½ asleep….    Question of the Day….   Do you do unusual things in your sleep (ex: walk, talk, eat, or clean)..?
