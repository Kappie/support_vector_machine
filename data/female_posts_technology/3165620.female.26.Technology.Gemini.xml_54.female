Today is shaping up to be just as slow. Here it is after noon and my biggest accomplishment is that I've showered and washed my hair. I'm living the high life now!  I'm thinking of going out to a plant nursery and picking up some herbs that I could grow in containers on my patio. The sunlight out here should be great for plants, provided I remember to water them enough.  I still need to come up with a gift for my sister. I'll be flying over a few days early, so I might put it off until I get there so I don't have to wrangle a package on the plane.
