Although it sounds more as if it's the nervous laugh of someone who might be under quite a bit of stress. Is that me laughing? No, I'm not laughing.  I know what the sounds are, those of collaboration. That's also a nice sound.  People always say that 'nice' is an insipid word, but I like it. It's 'nice'.  I like my world to be 'nice'. What's the opposite of nice? I think it's 'nasty'.   I think I was nasty today though, when I threw a box of teabags at one of my colleauges.  The tea in the teabags is always nice.
