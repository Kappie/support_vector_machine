My own sense of worthlessness is boring holes into my Swiss cheese brain. It's only self-imposed guilt, because my mother is an angel. I like visiting her because she is my rock on which I sharpen my comedy tongue. She's the straightmom to all my inside jokes to myself. But there are some things that make me hesitate and reconsider a visit when I'm tired and grumpy. I was going to stop by today, but my hair is dirty and she'd immediately eye my bangs, cluck disapprovingly, and tell me how gross my habits are. This is a difference of opinion. What she thinks is "gross" and "repellant", I think is "cool". She'd say to me in Vietnamese, "Your hair is dirty. You go out of the house looking like that? Shameful!" and I'd say in English: "That's the style... it's cool!" And she'd say in English, "'Cool'? What does that mean?"  Another reason I can't visit today, is that I'm full. With a language and cultural barrier, the only thing we share and enjoy doing together is eating. She likes to make food, I like to eat it: it's the perfect relationship. Once dinner is over though, she starts into family gossip which I don't enjoy. She comes from a close-knit family of 7 siblings divided over a complex and sticky situation that involves my invalid grandma and money matters. I don't like to hear about this because she wants sympathy and for me to vilify certain relatives and lionize others. This won't work because I don't like to be a partial judge. I don't know the other side of the story so I just shrug and flip through a magazine, nodding on occasion. Flaccid family gossip without the reward of stuffing my face first? Until I built up my appetite, my visit will have to be postponed.  And Abby, your siesta idea is genius. Fuck company policy. We'll stage a mini-revolution with the simple closure of our eyelids and the sideways drool that'll spill from our lips. You and me. It's gotta start somewhere. Viva la revolucion! Office admins unite in snoozitude!  And No-bra Wednesdays should be called Boobless Wednesdays because au naturel, my pert padded boobs become unspectacular pancakes. Actually come to think of it, the best name for this midweek liberation would be "Boobless Hump Days." We will be heroes and the president will sign this into holiday with 20 pens. It has a nice ring to it, Boobless Hump Days.
