Today my brother and I went out to look for car accessories and he ended up buying a new 200$ navigational watch...i want one...*drools* it can even recieve msn messages...*i want it more* LMAO! Actually I saw a wide screen lap top for really cheap so I think I'm gonna save up for that!                    I can't wait for my new room....I'm still emptying it out...yes I'm slow...I'm a lot weaker than I useta be...I wonder how much harder my slap would have been 2 years ago in comparison to when i hit mike recently... I probably woulda knocked him out with my old strength! but gosh...I'm as weak as a kitten now. I'll be going to karate tomorrow...I've misse the last few spots...arg... i need to train more.                    Yay! i talked to josh today and it's for sure I'm meeting him on saturday for a movie and possibly mini golf. I'm so excited :) Kevin took over my computer while I was talking to him online and well...ah! i hate when people touch my computer lol! Ack, I feel bad. I was boring when he was hanging out here today so he left early. Arg! Damn me and my boy crazy night.                    I'm still questioning where mike is...As much as everyone is telling me to forget him because of so many different reasons....i still wonder if he's thinking of me at all...I wonder if he cares abotu what his parents said to me and to my mom that night...
