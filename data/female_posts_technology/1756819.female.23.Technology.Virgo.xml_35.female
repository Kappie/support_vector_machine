In the morning while waiting for the guys at the Nissan dealer to change my oil, I read through the lesson and mapped out my plan of action.  The lesson was about the importance of language, and using positive language (along the theme of building others up).  However as I was driving home after work to pick up my stuff, I got a call from one of the other counselors.  She was going to have her girls do stamping.  They were going to make Christmas cards and use them for the stamping badge.  She asked if my girls would like to join them.  I agreed, so there went my lesson for the evening :)  Stamping was interesting.  Each girl responded very differently.  One of the girls had the slap it on and be done attitude.  She did three cards in the first 15 minutes and was bored for the rest of the evening.  Another girl had a sample that she wanted to mimic, and even though we didn't have all the necessary supplies, she persisted until she had a card that roughly matched the sample.    We also had fun with glitter.  Little girls love glitter.  A couple of the girls had minor (and quite amusing) accidents with the glitter.  One girl spilled glitter all over her black pants...she was covered.  She had to come over and show me her new glittery pants, and then proceeded to dance around the room, leaving a cloud of glitter behind her.  When another girl did the same thing, she sort of froze and stared down at her pants.  Then she sort of cried out that she had gotten glitter on herself.  Such different responses.  It was a very active and tiring evening but the girls are a lot of fun.  But I was missing one of my girls, which is sad, cuz I think she would have really enjoyed the stamping.
