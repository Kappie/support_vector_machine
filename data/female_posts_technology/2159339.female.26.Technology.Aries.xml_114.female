The music was very exciting, like hearing The Strokes for the first time. But unlike The Strokes, they don't look bored and jaded. W-gal and I tried to get their CD, but they're between labels right now and it's floating in limbo. I'm looking forward to seeing them again opening for the walrusman aka Sleepy Jackson.   Stratford 4  -- Snooze. BORRING! They need some vocal harmonies and a more enthusiastic drummer. She looked like she did not want to be there. She looked like she'd rather be at home watching Ray Romano on CBS. Heck, gimme those sticks woman! I may not know shit about rhythm, but lemme show you how it's DONE.   The Stills  -- I was in heaven. I love their songs. The basslines are fantastic and the guitar tones are so pretty. The melodies and guitar sounds remind me of "To the Sky" my favorite Cure song. I'd seen The Stills a couple months ago at Popscene, and they were only alright then. I thought they were overhyped and also, Popscene is the worst place to see a show: low stage, obstructive pillars... But on Friday, they'd grown into and exceeded their potential with flying sonic colors. It was solid. {applause}
