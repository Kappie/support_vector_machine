Printer problems and nosey people can be entertaining on a Friday.  So Thursday was definitely better than Wednesday evening.  Work was basically uneventful.  I made good progress on the menu I'm testing for my website.  Joined some work folks for a drink after work - Rachel, one of our way cool consultants, is moving on to bigger and better things, so we took the opportunity to get together.  Congrats Rachel!    And big congratulations go out to roomie Doug!  He finally got to see his score from the final Chiropractic Boards test he to take.  Phew!  That's done, the score was awesome, now onwards and upwards.  As for me and this rainy Friday....looks like we have an all morning meeting.  And I've got a margarita outing with some of the girls.  Other than that, not much is going on.   It's the Annual Stitch Along for Storyteller (Teresa Wentzler cross stitch), so I am planning to get that colorful draggie out for some stitches this weekend.  Nothing else is planned, so there's no telling what will happen.  Happy Friday everybody.  :o)
