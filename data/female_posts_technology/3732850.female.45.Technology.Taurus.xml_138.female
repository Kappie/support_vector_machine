I do get sick of all the pre-canned phrases and conversation starters though. In this essay the author certainly gave a lot of examples. Almost too many in my opinion. Each one made sense and opened my eyes more to the growing clutter in our language, but I almost got sick of this essay. Just my opinion. It's one of those essays I'm not sure if I like or not. I just read it, so give me a moment.... I can see his point. In some ways we're losing ourselves in all the expected phrases and socially acceptable conversations.  I thought it was funny how this author certainly wasn't shy with "big" words and long sentences. It was almost...cluttered.
