Is Pierce Brosnan too old to play 007? After the actor griped that the Bond flicks were getting too "formulaic" -- and began stumping for more plot-centric and less special-effects-laden material -- Bond producers are said to have come around to his way of thinking. But word is they're also thinking Bond, younger Bond, and may replace the 51-year-old Brosnan with Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Colin Firth, Clive Owen, Jude Law, Ewan McGregor, Gerard Butler or Cuba Gooding Jr.        mmm, yeah. they can't possibly be serious about cuba, could they? lord, i hope not.        speaking of jude law, i saw him at comic-con 2004. good lord, he's dreamy. he was with giovanni ribisi... mmmm.... mmmm... mmmm... okay. i'm all right now. at any rate, they were there stumping for their new flick "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow." i love them more than i hate gwyneth paltrow (female lead), so i'll go see it... also, angelina jolie is in it... and she's in an eyepatch. how cool is that???? heh...        comic-con was pretty effin' amazing this year. i got to see a couple of my fave artists... craig thompson (blankets - absolutely amazing graphic novel), chynna clugston-major (blue monday), and tom beland (true story: swear to god)... tom beland was really nice and down to earth... i got all tongue-tied, so i figure he thinks i'm a stuck up bitch. oh well. his book made me cry, it was so darn cute... i'm sure he hears that all the time, though. he drew me a sketch in my book i bought.... he inked it and everything. it was pretty nice... i still feel like abig ol' dumbass... i was just such a moron... yes, i'm a self-flagellator. but, i just feel so dumb still :( damn.i hate when i don't know what to say... :(        uhm, who else... who else... frank miller, robert rodriguez and some of the lovely ladies of "Sin City" were there to promote their flick. that looks like it's going to be hot! jaime king, rosario dawson, and jessica alba are gonna be in it... it looks like it's going to be kept really close to the source material... if you've not read frank miller's sin city stories, you absolutely have to. just classic.        matt stone/trey parker promoting their new marionette movie - team america: world police. that looks like it's just going to be comedy. i can't wait to watch it... the bad guy in the movie is kim jong il... i nearly pissed myself laughing so hard during the clips they were showing us... so, lessee... what else???        miles and miles of exhibitors, tons of free stuff... more geeks than you ever imagined you'd ever see... the first year i went, i was overwhelmed... but, every year it gets bigger and bigger...        it's funny, the first time i went (3 years ago) i was pretty scared. i mean, there were people there that i've never actually seen in public! guys that actually looked like the simpsons' comic book guy. and guys that look like they've never seen sun ... seems most people were very overweight or very skinny... and they're all in their element... so if you were a girl there, they tried to hit on you. i'm not trying to be mean or rude or anything, but boy... it was pretty sad... my husband (boyfriend at the time) let me get a drink of water by myself... by the time i got to the water fountain, there were 3 boys following me and another crowd just staring at me... i actually hadn't noticed until i bent over to take a drink from the fountain and my eye caught the 3 boys leaning over trying to catch a glimpse of cleavage or something... i was a little freaked out.        now, i don't care anymore. this last time i wore a school girl skirt that was cut so short, i actually thought it was a belt when i was in the store... har! Forever 21 rawks!
