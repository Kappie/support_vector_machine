I just love 'em. But!!! All this is gonna change. Never can decide whether change has a flattering or a hostile effect on life. If i wish that life comes to a stanstill, that takes away from me the opportunity to experience different versions of existence. On the other hand the lego pieces are  scattered and rearranged in a totally different structure, unknown to me.  It all comes to, "Enjoy life while u can, who knows where it takes u next".
