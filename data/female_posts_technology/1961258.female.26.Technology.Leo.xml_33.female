My mom wants me to lose lots of weight. She's always giving me these diet teas, every single day .. and when there's an infomercial on, she'll ask me to get the stuff no matter how crap it looks. Today she got me this slimming belt, this thing you wear around your waist that supposedly trims your tummy. I know it's crap but I'm wearing it to appease her. She also gives me this 'look' that she thinks I don't notice .. looking at my body (thighs, stomach, whatever) and saying to herself how fat I look - it comes out in a minimal way like .. drink this, or buy that, or use this .. and not YOU ARE FAT, DO SOMETHING! which she so wants to say.   It's unimaginable .. how I've always been fat, to her and everyone else in my life. Ever since I was 12 when I grew into my hips  breasts  my full height .. everyone has told me that I'm big-boned i.e. fat. I'm not blaming them .. but no matter what it's just not thin enough. I was 130 lbs and swimming miles a day, I'd always get the "Are you gaining weight? oh .. you should watch what you eat. you don't want to get fat". On to 145 lbs, and all the pushing me to go to the gym and workout and the same comments - your butt is widening etc. I remember once, we went out to lunch for my sister's birthday .. and she was all .. oh your buttons are gaping at the chest, you shouldn't eat so much and gesturing to me to not flash the waiter who was serving me. Then my dad went 'Oh did you gain weight?' and that was the last straw. My breasts got bigger, so sue me. One such incident out of zillions, and that was just from them. On to 165 lbs, it gets worse. On to 175 lbs. it gets worse. So what is it? If I'm NOT 120 lbs and flat chested and flat stomached and have stick thin thighs where they're as big as my calves and you have a canyon in between the thighs so they don't touch .. then I'm NOT THIN ENOUGH?! Not just to my mom but to everyone out there?!   I don't want to be super thin, but I don't want to feel like this all the time. To feel so inadequate just because I happen to weigh a certain number .. and have my mom basically badger me all the time about how big I am. I know she worries all the time that I will 'never find a guy' to love me .. because it's such a known 'fact' that fat girls NEVER get guys as much as their thin counterparts (right!). It's annoying the living crap out of me .. and yes, in a way she is true .. I don't have that many chances as a thin girl my age. Being thin is SUCH a commodity in the world today.   So ahh .. I want to lose 50 lbs. Not 30 lbs to get down to where I'm safe  happy .. but no, 50lbs. I'm so absolutely going to do this! By December! 5 months to lose 50 lbs! It can be done! Just eat .. freakin' watermelons all the time then. I need to give up chocolates .. my hugest vice. Ack! I'm ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY POUNDS, my sister iS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY POUNDS, same height .. there's something SO wrong there don't you think?!   MONTH(End)-  5 August    - 160, 165, 175  September - 150, 160, 180  October   - 140, 155, 185 November  - 130, 150, 190 December  - 120, 145, 195  So do you want to lose .. 10 lbs per month or 5 lbs per month (which is more realistic, I admit) OR do you want to gain more weight and just go past the point of no return?!   I don't even feel like wearing my lovely swimsuit .. I got 3 for good measure. One I got because it was cheap  held me in, another I got today because it was a nice racing suit and the final one was a lovely red halter, more for lounging than anything. But it's too bad .. because I can't bloody wear any of them. I won't go out in public with them .. or do things I so absolutely want to do .. like swim, or sail, or kayak, or anything. Because i'm FAT and don't want to 'impose' it on people.   I'm ashamed of myself, honestly .. 100% I am ashamed of my body .. of myself.  I was watching the Laureus Sports Awards and there was this 40-year-old man who still surfs these humongous waves every single day and a 67-year-old guy who climbs mountains and a woman who lost her leg but still swims competitively and here I am a 26-year-old girl .. not being able to do barely anything, because my fear holds me back. It's not technically my weight that holds me back .. but my fear of that weight, for the most part. How shameful.
