Got 4 free tickets so don't want to waste it.  Cool experience....We(me, Poh Wai, Kong and Foong Ling)went about 5 sumting, arriving at Bukit Kiara around 6pm and surprisingly many people are already there. Parking is a big disadvantage as we need to walk VERY FAR to reach the entrance to the cinema. But what the heck, the experience is worth it. We saw that cute guy from 8TV Quickie, whom I do not know the name. Anyway, Mai and Imran suppose to meet us there later but it was so crowded that they can't walk to our spot. Well, there are still a lot of room for improvement. 1) Parking- should open up more parking in the club itself and not all around it. 2) Entrance- should be more organised 3) Toilets- hmmmm.....as usual-Malaysian public toilets but 10x worst 4) Designate walkways to let people go in and out instead of having to step on people's mattresses 5) More food stalls!!!! 6) Ban people with smelly feet and shoes from taking off their shoes....uhhhh....the smell in horrible....  We are very luck that it did not rain and the weather is so cooling. We only stay for the first movie (they are showing LOTR trilogy, BTW). I wouldn't mnd staying till 7am in the morning because I LOVE LOTR!!!! Anyway, it was a well worth experience minus the smelly feet and smoking from some people who doesn't know what NO SMOKING means. So, a second time if I have the chance? COUNT ME IN!!!
