I told him I didn't want to go on the kayaking trip next weekend if it's just going to be just the two of us and that I didn’t appreciate him coming around just so he can sit on the couch and do his homework all day. What should we do, he asked. I couldn’t think of anything. Last night he brought over some porn for me to watch, but it got boring quickly, so I read my chemistry book instead (to make up for the fact that I left my lecture 5 minutes into it even though I had gotten to class 45 minutes early)..I got through 3 chapters, pretending to concentrate on oxidation-reduction reactions and electron exchanges, just so that he wouldn’t bother me. Some of it actually sunk in. But eventually we had to talk things out and in the end nothing got resolved. I rolled my eyes at his ignorant comments about why people get together, which he couldn’t see in the dark. I told him that he’s making me depressed. He said it was probably Tindersticks playing on repeat. Yes, that too. So I’m back to thinking that this is not such a good idea. But on the bright side, my mums is taking me out to lunch today. Oh, and Tom is going to be a the show tonight.
