She said, "Well, think about how he's fat and hairy." Check and check. He is fat. He is indeed hairy. She told me to think about how hairy guys smell because the hair traps in the stink and I agreed with her apt assessment, because it is true. But the difference between me and my cousin is that I don't care about looks. I once dated the ugliest guy I'd ever laid eyes upon. My rose-colored lenses are of a real strong prescription...  His name was Doofus Duck and he had the most jacked-up set of choppers I'd ever seen in my entire life. There was no order to the alignment of his teeth. If his teeth were a government, they would be anarchy; if his teeth were a Greek god, they would be Chaos; if his teeth were one of the seven endless, they would be Despair. They were disgusting and disturbing because not only were they beyond crooked, there was a hardened layer of green that lined his gums from his chain-smoking and non-teeth brushing. The balls of his feet were so bulbous and meaty that his toes didn't touch the ground. They couldn't. They were curled up and nestled in their high nook above the floor.  In retrospect, I shudder, but at the time I loved this freak and I would still be with him if he wasn't a liar, a thief, and no darn good. And, he didn't know how to shut the fuck up.   I thought that someone of this ugly calibre could only be wonderful and wholesome and like fresh-baked bread, but he was ugly, inside and out. He was a stale moldy heel. And I was with him for two years.
