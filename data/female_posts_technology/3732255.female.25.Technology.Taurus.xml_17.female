Shai Hulud, who have been breaking up for longer than they've been together (or so it seems these days), posted the following in regards to their supposed "last show" at Hellfest (which wraps up today):Good grief. So much hubbub. Listen, Hulud is only alotted a 25 minute set at Hell Fest. My friends, you may disagree, but we Huluds - even the ones not continuing on with the band - feel Hulud's "last show" is worth more than 25 minutes. What does this mean? Cripes, does it have to be spelled out for you? We ain't quitting just yet. Fact: Yes, Hell Fest will most likely be Geert's last show with the band. Ree-guard-less, the music you'll be hearing and the words we'll be singing aren't getting a burial. Not this Sunday; not even next. Business as usual over here. Onward and upward. Think you got the vocal chops? Send Mad Matt Fletcher an email:  urlLink fletcher@hulud.com .  Via  urlLink punknews.org
