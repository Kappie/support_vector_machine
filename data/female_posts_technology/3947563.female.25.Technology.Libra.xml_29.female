Chicken breast baked in a tomato-vegetable sauce, a potato (basically boiled) and canned green beans, because I have an unholy obsession with canned green beans.  Snack- Several pickled onions...unfortunately they made my tummy hurt because I ate them right before bed  Here is the best part, I made enough chicken to last the whole week (although Ryan ate Friday on me...) so that I don't have to cook. I rock, I tell you. I also got in the 8 glasses of water yesterday, AND the multivitamin.  I shirked out on working out because by the time I ate it was almost 9, and then I was full of food and sleepy. But I still have 6 more days to work in those 5 workouts. I think it's apparent what could hold me back, eh?
