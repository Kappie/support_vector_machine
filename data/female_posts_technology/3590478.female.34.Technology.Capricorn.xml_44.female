It seems I don't have any and can't free base it. Scientists know about chemistry but I don't know any. Well, except my dad. But he's a rocket scientist and I don't think he knows any chemis....oh, wait, never mind. The Internet, on the other hand, is my friend.)   urlLink http://blacktable.com/fara1040428.htm  Excellent site that helps me obtain my goal of becoming an anal retentive drunky drunk  while, hopefully, keeping my liver from falling out.  urlLink http://www.amiannoying.com/(vbp33bnanitzlfqfb5fsij45)/Default.aspx  This is an outstanding waste of (company) time! Bonus, take the annoying test. (I did and, surprisingly, I'm extremely annoying.)  urlLink http://www.friendster.com/login.jsp?next=%2Fhome.jsp  Please join this now. Being the epitome of annoying, I need all the friends I can get.     urlLink http://www.marshmallowfluff.com/htm/welcome.shtml  The most demanding sanitary conditions? Oh god.  Once I gave my nephew a super sized  jar of marshmallow fluff as a Christmas gift. I had to explain to him how it was whipped sugar (being 3 and all, he couldn't read but he instantly grasp the concept of whipped sugar.  Whipped. Sugar.)  and for the rest of the day he was unwilling to release the jar. I was being supervised just a little too closely to actually open the jar for him but his parents had to pry it from his fingers at the expense of a foot stomping, head banging, arm waving hissy fit so it all turned out well in the end. Check out the enclosed photo. It's Buffy and Heather Duke, holding hands! Or, you could say it's Kendall and Brenda holding hands, whatever. It's all good.  And one more small thing. As you all are well aware, Buffy season six is being released a week from today onto DVD. Now, I'm sure a whole pack of you have pre ordered and will have the vampirey goodness in your hot little hands before the 25th. To that lot I want to say: You are my very best friends in the  whole wide world . Please call me ASAP so that we can plan our viewing fest and to let me know exactly how much liquor I need to bring.      Greenlee: "I'm not here to bail you out, Simone - I'm here to fire you!"  Kendall: " Hello , partner - you can't just fire Simone!"  Greenlee: " Hello , moron - this is her third arrest in a month!" -All My Children
