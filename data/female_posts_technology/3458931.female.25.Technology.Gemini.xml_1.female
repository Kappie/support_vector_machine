We would usually just sit in bed for hours talking, we never got tired of each other and we had the best conversations. I'm not angry today, I'm not making up crazy scenarios in my head, I'm just so damn lonely and sad.   It's so hard to see why he thinks this is the right thing to do. He said we'd be better of, he said we never really needed him anyway. He really doesn't know how deeply in love I was, still am. He doesn't know how much J looked up to him.  Who could abandon thier best friend and lover and think that it's the right thing to do?
