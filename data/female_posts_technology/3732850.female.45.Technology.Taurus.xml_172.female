She displays her sarcastic tone and honesty in describing how she herself shows off. “And then there was us, complaining about how tired we are today because we went to work, rushed back to see our son’s school play, shopped at the market and hurried home in order to cook gourmet, and then needlepointed another dining-room chair. And what we are doing is showing off”.  Viorst is also uses humor in her writing. She displays this by titling the different categories of showoffs as competitive showoffs (CSO), narcissistic showoffs (NSO), and insecure showoffs (ISO).  I think that we all know at least one person who could fit in one or more of these categories. More importantly, it makes me wonder which one I would fit into.
