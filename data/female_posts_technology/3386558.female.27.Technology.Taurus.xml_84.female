Strong Stuff     i built a bridge   out of my flesh   to get to you   -over the ocean   of swelling emotions   we carried on our backs.   bone by bone,   i picked myself apart   and bound it all together   with the veins of my heart,   knowing it would be safe   to cross.   i am made of strong stuff,   and i can hold my own.      -A
