And I'm writing this, sitting in the office on a public holiday..bored to tears..working from 7am to 1pm malaysian time.  *yawn*  I'm going back to my hometown this coming weekend :) gosh...really looking forward to it man!!! I haven't gone back so long...my mum must have forgotten how i look like already :P hmm...kinda hungry rite now. luckily my housemate Kaancana brought some food for me. She's also my office colleague. Well, back to work people.. till later!
