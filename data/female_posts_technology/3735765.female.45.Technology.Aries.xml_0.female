Hershey Kisses on lamplights in Hershey PA (and the chocolate factory), Amish cooking in PA, Bush Gardens in VA, Graduation Ceremonies in Annapolis MD, Royal Gorge in CO, Ghost Towns in AZ, Knotts Berry Farm in CA, Disney Land in CA and Disney World in FL, Bear Lake in CO, Redlands in CA, MoRanch in TX, Camp Mystic in TX, James Avery in Kerrville TX,  YMCA of the Rockies in Estes Park CO,  all the memorials in Washington DC, lights and sounds of New York City NY, Natural Bridge Caverns in New Braunfels TX, Cascade Caverns in NM, etc -- among many adventures along various roadways and highways across the United States.   This doesn't include all the adventures we had in Acapulco Mexico, West Germany (before the fall of the wall) and the Rhine River, Switzerland, Austria, and Lichenstein.  Bringing up my daughter, I shared some of the excitement of the adventures by taking her to MoRanch in TX, Talledega in Birmingham AL, Dinansour Tracks Safari in Grand Prairie TX, Noah's Ark Safari in Bastrop TX, and as much as I could afford (and as time off from work would allow).   Times were tough, but we had additional adventures in our move to and from South Carolina, as well as during the time we lived there, including the sights and sounds of Charleston, Sommerville, Beaufort, Myrtle Beach SC and Savannah GA.  Hwy 95 offered us additional adventures driving up and down the east coast to and from CT, and one time we took a side adventure down the Skyline Parkway of the Blue Ridge Mountains.  Recently, I couldn't standed it any longer and added a mission trip last summer to the beautiful country of Guatemala (See my blog on  urlLink Bluebonnet Missions  for additional information about that trip) to my adventures.  I plan to add additional mission trips in the future, as well as opportunities to explore Canada, other Latin American countries, and much more...  Hopefully, through this site, you will be able to join my adventure.   With respect to Roy Rogers, "Happy Trails" to us all!! :)
