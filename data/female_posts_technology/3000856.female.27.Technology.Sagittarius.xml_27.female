I am paying to fly them both out here.  I am very excited about meeting them for the first time, but I am gonna be so broke.  Between my vacation and flying them both out here and paying off a bunch of shit, man I am gonna be one poor mother fucker! I know I am gonna need a new car by the fall. That is why I am paying off everything I can now.  I am thinking about getting another part time job making cash for the time being.  I found out today I am secure w/ my job at least until the end of summer.  I am still looking, but at least I don't have to be in such a panic right now.  With all of this shit I need I have no idea how I am gonna pull this off.  Its not like I can get rid of anything cause I need everything that I have.  I payed off all my credit cards and my student loans so at least those are taken care of. Now I am just paying off stupid hospital bills and other bills that Sean left me w/ and I am still dealing with.  I should be fine by the end of summer.  Broke but fine. 3 more weeks till we leave for FL! Yeah I can't wait and Collen is so excited also. I have to figure out what I will do w/ Dena and Kelly when they fly in from Cali. They have never been to Chicago before.  I want to make it really cool for them.  Probably hit downtown, the zoo visit family and all that fun stuff.  I will figure it out, I have a little time left.  Time for me to relax and veg out tonight w/ a movie! Holy cow I can't believe I am actually gonna veg.  Now if I can have the opportunity to do it for a whole day now that will be a treat!
