It's 3 miles of paved trail (circular) with some nice hills and sharp turns (that I nearly bit it on quite a few times)  I did 15 quick miles (45 minutes to an hour of hard riding).   Last night's food: spinach  carrots tomotoes  So, today marks my one week anniversary of choosing to eat mostly raw foods.  I'm not 100% raw yet, and I hope to be within the next few coming months. I refuse to let myself give up or wimp out. This is a life style change for me. I do anticipate my making mistakes from time to time, but I'm not going to allow those to become excuses to continue making bad choices. I put my scale away so I'd stop standing on it every morning (and night), but now I'm just looking in the mirror instead. I think I like the results from the mirror better than I'd like what the scale might have to say. For one week, I'm pretty impressed.  I'm looking forward to my one month raw!
