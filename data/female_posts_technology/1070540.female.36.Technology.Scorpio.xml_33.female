I swore I would never write on this again.  but I since I am pretty much sure noone ever reads this.....But......I truely crave to have his baby.  I want a part of him to grow inside me. to nuture.  and to know that when the baby is born that the baby will have a dad who loves her/him intensly.  And have grandparents around too.   I know he does not want a child (which I do but dont understand) I try real hard to cover my feelings about this..but sometimes it makes me ill.  (which I dont understand at all either)  I do not know how to explain this but love....I love him so much...I want something of his...something we can share...something that we can both love and grow with.  also,  noone could ever take this child away from us.     OK...I am about to cry again...but I had to write this out ...so I can STOP thinking about it.You know, when someone asks you....what do you reallly want????????  all I can think of is to have my Kens baby.............................I pray that I can stop this feeling....its hurts my heart so.... to know I cant give him and he does not want...the one thing that I want to give him.........Please lord take this feeling away..........
