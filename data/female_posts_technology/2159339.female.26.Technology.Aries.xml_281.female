They're both playing this weekend, but I've run out of money. Image: Me turning out my trouser pockets to show sad emptiness. Maybe I can convince XX to take me to BartD tomorrow night.   In semi-related hilarity, I'd like to congratulate myself on the awful pixelation of BartD's pic above. It's truly horrendous/hilarious and takes this blog to new lows/highs. Sorry Abby, left alone, I've dragged our blog through mud. Pixelated mud.
