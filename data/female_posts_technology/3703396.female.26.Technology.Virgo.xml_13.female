We cannot reach any destination without encountering construction of roads, buildings, schools, freeways, hospitals, stores, or homes.  The growth explosion in Gilbert is of course, why we moved here; but I don't think either of us were prepared for the extreme amount of construction we are faced with.    Andrew has to commute through this crap every single day to get to work and back.  It should  not  take 30-40 minutes to go 7 miles to US60, but it does.  No matter which road you take, north-south or east-west, every single one is torn to bits.  The accident numbers are climbing every day.  We've had five motor fatalities in Gilbert so far this year, up from three all of last year, and zero the year before that.  We built our house just under 2 miles south of where a brand new freeway is going in called the San Tan Freeway.  It is supposed to be done in late 2005, and most freeways here (unbelievably) are done ahead of schedule.  I'm just hoping all the waiting around is worth it, and that all the new traffic it brings won't cause us more headaches than the construction is today.
