But, then he gets his Girlfriend pregnant and he is thrilled.  And to beat all..he is going through the clothes I saved that my kids had when they were little, and is going to let his new baby wear then.. GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.....  You know what I dont understand why do guys want babies by other people and not by me?  I wish Ken was the dad of my children he is a wonderful father.  I love to watch him with Brian, and with the older kids!    He plays with them, loves on them, scolds them.  He is so perfect!   I found the most perfect man.
