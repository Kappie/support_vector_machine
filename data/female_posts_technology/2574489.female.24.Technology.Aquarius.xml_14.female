I did my morning ritual and then walked out of the bedroom and saw breakfast on the table....SPAM fried in eggs!  I didn't know whether to be touched or annoyed...I chose to be touched.  But I have a sneaking suspicion he was rubbing it in my face that he had done what I had proclaimed I would do but never did....Hmmph!  Anyway, today's Friday Five is interesting:  You have just won one million dollars:   1. Who do you call first?   My husband!   2. What is the first thing you buy for yourself?   A BMW X5 in silver   3. What is the first thing you buy for someone else?   Pay off my mother's house so they own it.   4. Do you give any away? If yes, to whom?   Yes. I would give to charity   5. Do you invest any? If so, how?   Definitely invest.  I have been thinking about this a lot.  After setting aside maybe 30% of it in the bank. For the rest, I would put about 60% in stocks (large cap and small cap), including stocks for Walmart, Paycheck, Johnson and Johnson, some QQQs, Index funds and others.  I would put 15% in REIT Funds (Real Estate Funds), and 10% in bond funds, and another 10% in government bonds.  I would also purchase apartment complexes.....Okay, tin, calm down, its a theoretical question.  Have a good weekend everyone!
