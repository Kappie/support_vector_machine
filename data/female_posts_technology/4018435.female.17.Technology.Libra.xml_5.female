Her mother is such a sweetheart and Heather, although our schedules clash, is a wonderful friend and is there if I need to talk to her. Her mom made an awesome mango and chicken dinner with a side of rice and mixed vegetables. Ooo! best part- they had Nestea! That's the one drink I can't resist or get sick of! A house with Nestea is a happy house! LMAO! Heather and I got to play cards, watch Versus and she showed me a few things on photoshop that I need to remember in order to create my pretty pictures. She's leaving for algonquin tomorrow...*cries*!!! I wont be able to see her for a month or more but she said she'd try and call me.  This morning I hada good time with my mom at the Farmers Market. We hadn't been in a while but we had a blast. I bought a couple of leather cuffs to wear on my wrists and i got a Beenie Baby Dragon for my older brother cuz I know he love's dragons. We brought our puppy along and man is he hard to pull along.  After when we were driving home my mom and I spotted a few nice cars and one was this kinda crappy chevy thing, but it was in good condition and kinda rare to see. I thought "oh kool" untill i saw the liscence plate "MIKESSS". I just cracked! I jsut went, "AAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!" and my mom told me to calm down and to take a deep breath the way she does when she knows I feel like I wanna punch something. Of course it was kinda funny the way we both reacted to it.  I'm not quite sure what else to write. Hopefully I can get a holf of my bro and visit him at his friend's/my managers party. I was supposed to go earlier, but I couldn't pass up on a chance to see heather. Saying no to seeing heather is like missing a solar eclipse!  I'll be starting to take apart my room just to clean up my walls with posters and taking down things that remind me of things I don't want to cry over. Maybe I'll be able to cover up the new hole I made when I kicked it... (-.-)'   How much longer do I have to wait in order to see or hear from the one who claims to love me?  -Still holdin together,  Lonewolf
