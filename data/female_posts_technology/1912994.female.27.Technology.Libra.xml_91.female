(we hope he is still alive - we have not heard anything about his condition)...Realize she has had him for 5 years, that is only about 5% of his life expendency, so 5 years in turtle time is nothing - and i want him back!  let the legal games begin... after all, she has admitted it was orginally mine (in writting, emails, etc) which is all the proof I need in a florida civil case.  interesting part is she will have to fly down here to attend the case, that should be fun.
