We'll be chasing this stuff down right down to the very last second before school starts! the guys are working their tails off, but right now for every work order they sign off, there are two new ones! what has been a pleasant surprise so far is how nice people who have been calling have been, both in person and in voice mail...even the people who indicate that they have a kinda emergency (real or imagined) are very nice and have been asking for help just "as soon as you can; i know you guys are really busy"...hope we can service everyone well and can keep this feelgood thing rolling....with this kind of attitude, there is no limit to what we can get done!  exciting work continues toward our goal of a managed network...soon we will be training and practicing with all the new tools, so we can start implementation (slowly and in selective locations at first, them fully throughout the district) our department will get lots more done....we are excited about all the tools and hardware, in typical geek fashion.  better get to setting up some more email accounts and then catch a couple Zzzzz's... on to tomorrow, when we'll do it all again! talk to ya! ;-)
