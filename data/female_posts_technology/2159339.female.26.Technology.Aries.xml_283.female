Margaret Cho is one of his clients. I'm totally excited, but I'll have to set the timer on my VCR as I'm hanging out with a friend who doesn't want to watch this with me. Sometimes I question my friends. ("Why are you talking over Seth Cohen? Shht! No-talking-over-Seth-Cohen!")   *  urlLink PJ Harvey 's new CD, Uh Huh Her, comes out today. I own almost all of her albums and I adore Ms. Harvey. My favorite album?     * Over the weekend I went to the Art Deco exhibit at the  urlLink Legion of Honor . I highly recommend this exhibit. It's thoughtful and incorporates diverse aspects that comprise the movement such as fashion, furniture, and entertainment, as well as standard art like sculpture and painting. The one thing that was missing from the exhibit was a piece on SF's own Palace of Fine Arts! Our very own Art Deco monument in the city, missing from the exhibit! Fer chrissakes!! World scope is great, but allow us a little regional pride! For those who went to the exhibit and want some local learnin, here's some  urlLink hizzistry  for some KQED-style schoolin! Whoop-whoop, y'all!     * David Sedaris's new  urlLink book  is out! I love his essays, his books, his readings, his everything. He has such keen observations and his writing is so witty and succinct. I'm almost jealous of his literary-superhero qualities, but only almost. At his readings he always ends with a book recommendation that allows him to address the audience directly. He talks spontaneously and conversationally and when he does this, he can be inarticulate and--dare-I-type-- dithering . This makes him all the more awesome! Long live brainiac social retards!  * Lastly, I'd like to wish Abby Apple a safe road trip towards the wilds of Wisconsin. This week there'll only be one bad apple musing randomly from her boring office job. I will do my best.
