If you think you'll lose, You're lost; For out in the world we find Success begins with a fellow's will, It's all in the state of mind.  If you think you're outclassed, You are; You've got to think high, To rise. You've got to be sure of yourself Before you 'll ever win the prize.  Life's battles don't always go To the stronger or faster man, But sooner or later, The man who wins Is the person who thinks he can!
