I have chocolate milk every day, and usually have a milk-based shake or cream cheese at least once, too. I try to make it 1% or lite whenever possible, though.   Kate: Creamcheese Pinwheels are simply : 1 tortilla, spread some creamcheese on it (I like lite smoked salmon), then another tortilla, then another thin layer of creamcheese (I usually have just plain lite for the second layer), then roll it up, using the creamcheese kind of like glue, and slice it into little circles. Its kind of fun and snacky, but reasonably low fat, and tortillas are fat free.
