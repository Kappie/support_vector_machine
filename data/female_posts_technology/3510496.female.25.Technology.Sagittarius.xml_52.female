I am guaranteed it will continue to linger until end of this week. Thats the thing I like about the everlasting- setanggi . We've been scrooge-ingly burning it for the cause we bought it from Medina. But of course we can always pick up it in those stores here.  I was half-geared for work when I passed by my living room. I could see the sunray despite through my tinted balcony door. I slided it open, and drew up one of the woven blinds.   How I wish we could 'waste' more time to have our morning meal on the balcony seat. I miss having that. But work had the better of me, and I had to fall in earlier due to some training I had to conduct.  Walking into the office space took a thoroughly different turn from my earlier hours. Albeit no mood, training has to go on. No mood, but I never fail to do it well. This is hypocrisy. Don't you think so? My idiosyncracy has lead me to be a hypocrite. Why can't I simply be like heck-care-I-couldn't-care-less attitude in here?  Suddenly, I terribly miss someone. Who had left me(us) for 3 long years. She was more like a 'Mother' to me. After she'd gone, and everytime I squabbled with Mama, I would always think of her. With initial anger, follows by sadness, I would childishly said this to myself, "Kalau Busu ade lagi kat sini, mesti Mama tak bole marah kan."     Unconditional Love   She treated all her nieces and nephews well, being her unmarried. When we teased her into marriage, she would 'lament' for a  Datuk  to betroth to. Hihihi ... but of course she never gets her  Datuk , because she devoted herself in taking care of our  Datuk , her father.   Generosity   In most of my elder cousins' wedding, you will definitely see her as the most-toiling one, even than the parents-of-the-bride/groom. She gave her 'sponsors' on some wedding stuffs. That's why we cousins were pestering her to get hitch, so we could pay for her wedding. But of course, there is no wedding of her, and she left me too early before I could repay her anything.   Birthday Planner   She met her demise the eve of my brother's 19th. Birthdays have become 'blue' to us every since then. She never fail to shower us with small parties, cakes and presents.   Open+Stubborness   When she says it, she means it, and she does it. I guess that explains where I inherit those genes from.   Hygiene-Freak   Having her in any home, would guarantee an extremely shiny, spick and span condition. A clean, damp towel would be her 'precious item'.   Cat Lover   Everytime, my parents and I called her for a holiday, she would be utterly concern of her 2 'children' (reads: Pet cats). She only obliged to one June 2001 aussie trip. But of course the trip never come. She departed on April 2001.     I know no matter how much I cry for her now, I understand, that Allah loves her more.
