I met so many wonderful people, discovered so many things about my hubby as a child, was warmly introduced to his wonderful family.   I have to say one thing that struck me the most about Moroccans were how physicaly beautiful they were. They had such ranges of beauty as well. From fair-skinned to dark-skinned, from Latin looking, caucasian looking. The only thing missing were Asian looking ones!  Filipinos are beautiful too, of course. But everyone from the Philippines must have the experience of being in a "palenke" (wet market) or a particularly poor area, and seeing the weather-beaten, haggard, faces of our working/poor class, their hardships etched on their faces.    When I went to the wet market in the Northern area of Morocco (close to the Spanish territory), their vendors, their poor, were so gorgeous.  Gorgeous faces, with great skin, brown, even blue and green eyes. They were the equivalent of our mestizas, I suppose, their blood comingled with Spanish ones.    Here are some of the beautiful children I came across in Morocco: Unsa and Wafa, niece and daughter of my sis-in-law's housekeeper.   Miriam,mom-in-law's best friend's grand-daughter   My nephew, Ali
