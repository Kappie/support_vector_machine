Mayor Seng and Governor Johanns keep telling people not to go, to chase out the Nazis and show them that this is not a "state of hate". There's to be some protesting in the streets against it. I wish I could go but my parents are busy.  We're hoping that no one shows up at the rally so that the Nazis will get embarrassed after all this press attention. Ha! They'll never come back again, I hope. I believe the reason they are bothering to show up here at all is that our minority population is considerably low, both racially and religiously. Religiously, we have a few Jewish synagouges in Lincoln and Omaha, but that's about it. Racially, the percent of people that are white is like, 90 something (I can't find the stupid almanac right now.) So the Nazis figured, "Hey it's all good if we go there, since there aren't going to be hordes of diverse people around there." WRONG. We'll kick their sorry asses right out of the state. ^^      ~Valkyrie Juno signing off~
