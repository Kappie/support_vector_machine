I guess I can see what she is talking about, how the garbage itself is lonely. I can only imagine that she herself must be lonely. Although I do believe that she may require some psychiatric help, she does have a way with garbage and how it relates to her life, first coming and then going. I do believe that we all should take the resposibility for our waste. But I don't believe that one should thrive in it.
