He was dressed in loose pants that seemed to flow with his body and a light shirt for the summer days. He carried a pack on his shoulder and his hair seemed a little long and touched his shoulders with each sway of his body. He seemd unnaturally pale or possibly a different skin color altogether for it seemd that the sun had never touched his face nor his arms. His eyes had a foreign touch almost as if he was a cat with satisfied slanted eyes.
