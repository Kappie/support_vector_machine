I didn't know what to do with myself this weekend.  ...ok, so maybe I did...  I left work at 2:00 Friday afternoon, went to E and got drunk in the middle of the afternoon with some of the team members.  I was lucky enough to have a safe ride home, and got my car Saturday afternoon, once I woke up.  Not sure how much of the sleep was caused by the past week's work schedule and how much was caused by the celebration, but it was  wonderful  (although anyone who knows me is well aware that staying in bed past 8:00 on a weekend is unheard of for me, not to mention the intense guilt I feel having lost half a day...).  This week is going to be mostly touch-ups and tweaks (and rest) for most of the team - I'm headed to that  urlLink shindig  in D.C.  We'll call it DblU meets Dubya.  :)
