Frederic Gozlan, head of technical services at the airport, said efforts were under way to clear the crickets who are believed to have flown in from Italy or North Africa.  "The crickets look for and love the sun, but we have to hunt them down before they eat all the grass by the runways," he said, adding that the grass was needed to hold dust and gravel in place when planes land and take off.  "If the insects are not a real danger for the jet engines, what is more serious is that they attract birds who are very dangerous for air traffic."  Airport workers were trying to pulverize the crickets and destroy them with chemicals that would not damage the environment.
