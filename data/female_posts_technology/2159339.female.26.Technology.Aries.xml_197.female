I heard them from far away and knew that Kelly is taking her the 'marketing route' so that I can meet her. In preparation, I rubbed my right hand vigorously on the chair. Shit, I thought to myself, not again. But I'm happy to report, it wasn't as bad as the meeting yesterday. Yes, my hand was still clammy (gross) but my thumb stayed on its appropriate side and I managed to smile. I thought about telling her that I'm sick (which I still am) to avoid the handshake part of the meeting, but things were happening so fast that before I knew it, her hand was right in front of me and I couldn't do anything but shake it. Luckily, she was holding a baby with her other hand, so the conversation quickly switched to the its cuteness and preciousness. Phew. Another major disaster averted. They should teach a class on hand shaking. Really.
