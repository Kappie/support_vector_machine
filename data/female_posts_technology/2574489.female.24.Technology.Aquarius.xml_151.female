I need to do so many things like get my eyebrows done, buy some additional clothes, maybe get my toenails done. I have to set my mind at ease by tidying up the house and doing other chores, plus leaving instructions with hubby before I leave.   Since San Diego has a large Filipino population I am looking forward to visiting the Filipino bakeries and shops there. I may also visit Jollibee! Yup, they have a Jollibee branch in SD.   Funny thing hubby pointed out. Whenever I mention visiting Philippines, San Diego or any other place, I always mention all the food I want to taste there. Hubby asked me if I am visiting for the food! I say its part of the experience, right?  Or maybe I am a bit food crazy. Just a bit though.
