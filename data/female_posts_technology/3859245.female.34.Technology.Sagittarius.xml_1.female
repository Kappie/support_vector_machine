It was also nice to wear a swimsuit by the pool and not be totally mortified!   We are in convention season now, and I was really amazed at Bill Clinton last night. He is such an amazing speaker. I am certain that if he ran today he would get elected. Jimmy Carter was great too. It was fun to see such a mild mannered guy go after the Reps. like he did.   As I get back into the swing of things I am going to have to get caught up on the political comings and goings. It was nice to have an a-political week however.   Adios for now.  J
