Then I come home and this evening, the 'normal' scale hits 170 (okay) but the digital scale reads .. SEVENTY NINE point SEVEN! Can you believe that? And my body fat is almost 43% and my body water is 39%! How can that be?!   I know I ate .. consistently, I would have to say. A big breakfast, not with every single thing I can gorge myself but portions here and there AND I was watching what I ate. No lunch, because of big breakfast. Then dinner later on - seafood, no cream sauces or fattening stuff. And I walked miles every single day and swam and kayaked. So what gives? Argh .. I'm EIGHTY freaking kilograms! OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I mean it's so not possible that just because I ate for the day and was on the plane, that I'm bloated and dehydrated. It was hours ago. So what gives? If the scale reads 80 kg or 90 kg or 100 kg .. I am that weight. So freakin gross.   If I'm 80 kg that means I'm 80 x 2.2 = 176 lbs. Back to 175 lbs AGAIN?! Geez .. no wonder I looked so horrible in everything. I thought the pictures I took turned out okay, but argh .. apparently NOT!!!!   I feel like hiding out in my house and never going out .. honestly. I sometimes look in the mirror and really think that what I see doesn't correspond with what I really look like i.e. what people really see.    It's disappointing to go by the pool and see these healthy women wearing bikinis .. I say healthy because they're not skinny but nicely shaped, womanly (true ones, not me .. I'm just fat but womanly sounds nicer eh? instead of obese) .. and they look amazing. Why couldn't I have thought I was okay when I was that weight? Or more importantly why didn't anyone think I was OKAY at that weight?   I am so screwed .. in life .. in everything.
