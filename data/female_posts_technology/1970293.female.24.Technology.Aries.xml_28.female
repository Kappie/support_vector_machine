With a small smile resting upon her lips as she remembered the first time she ever had a infatuation with a man.  It was so long ago.  A man who was more a boy pretending to be a man.  She wondered if he still thought of her fondly as she thought of him.  It was only a few years later that she met the love of her life.  Her finely wrought features brightened as she thought of her lover.  He is so wonderful and fulfilling.  Her smile grew sensually as her thoughts moved to the night.  He would come and make windfall sweet blissful love to her tonight.  She would love him with her hands, mouth, and body until he would never want to leave.  She loved his wild hair and how it would never straighten and his big shoulders and arms that hold her, oh, so tight.  His thick lips drove her to erotic dreams of him tasting her, delving deeply inside her, so hot and insistent.  She could feel herself slowly getting wet as her thoughts grew more imaginative of his lovingness.  She grew restless with anticipation, wondering how much longer he would be until she could enjoy his charms.  She turned her hazel eyes toward the door hoping the noise she heard was him coming up the stairs.  A knock sounded at the door.  "Come."  A servant girl appeared, curtsying before delivering her message.  "A soldier below stairs has said Master Wil is dead, milady."  The servant girl left quickly after that bit of news.  She dropped her brush until the floor as she stood up in shock.  How could this be?  He was just here last night in her bed.  She felt her heart pound and slowly break into a thousand pieces.  She could not believe this news.  It could not be possible.  She heard a wagon in the court yard below her tower room.  She hurried over and looked down.  There he was wrapped in his cape and colors lying still in the wagon.  No thoughts ran through her mind as she stepped onto the window ledge.  With no thoughts of herself as she slowly left herself slipped from the tower ledge to fall into the courtyard below to be with her love.  Her heart would stop hurting and she would be at peace to be with him for eternity.    Her body crashed on top of the wagon beside his.  She died on contact.  The servants buried them together in the same grave, knowing that they would never part in life or in death forevermore.  All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003
