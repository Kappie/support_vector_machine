If you scroll all the way down the bottom of the sidebar ( all  the way down the very bottom, past the babble fish and the very quiet shoutbox) you will see the new blogrolling-powered-links, which are essentially all the blogs that have been linked here so far. The ones that have been published in the last 48 hours will have a small orange piece of text saying  new post  beneath them.  Objective; to help read through every single blog all the time to see if there are any new posts/more new Iraq blogs.  Update: well the "new post" text worked in orange when i tested it, but now it seems to be showing up in black (which isn't so readable against dark blue, damnit, does that mean the colour scheme has to change all over again? and just when the decore was looking so optimistic)  Later update: after blogrolling links have been visited they turn orange and indigo, groovy hey (go on, click one, u know u want to try it) yalla, stop fiddling now (that is, i must stop fiddling now).
