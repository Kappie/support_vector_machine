I dont think I have mentioned two people that are going to be joining me here at the end of my phase one. They are two friends that are more dear to me than either one will ever know. They have agreed to be my support. At the end of my two weeks I am adding them and they will be allowed to read this and add posts.   The first one is Dave. I met him online in an online game about 6 years ago. It seems like a lifetime. Over the years we have shared and talked about just about everything. Two years ago I even traveled to Vermont (clear across the country) to his wedding. I trust him. I also trust him to tell me the truth. If I am screwing up he will tell me. If I am doing well he will tell me that too.   The second is Debbee. I met her online also. I met Debbee about 3 years ago. We became good friends. This last January, we took a trip together to Thailand and had a great time. Support works both ways. Friendship works both ways. She too will tell me if she thinks I am doing good or bad and I cant wait till she can move here and live with my family and I.  My plan for the day is to drink lots of water, have salads and some chicken and perhaps a steak and some low carb icecream.
