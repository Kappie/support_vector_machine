Everwood is one of the less cheesy of the WB shows (7th Heaven would be the most cheesy.)  I say "less" cheesy because it definitely still is cheesy, but it's just REAL too sometimes.  It's real in a way that the Brady's and Cosby's were not.  Everwood does have some great music.  Last night's show was kind of sad, so I bet some of the songs could go into the next great depressing mix cd.  Although you can't force it.  It just has to happen.  Another song I'd suggest is "Time and Time Again" by Counting Crows.  Although the entire album  August and Everything After  could probably beat out any depressing mix cd.  Back to the topic of Everwood, I really hope that Ephram and Amy get together.  I know it's too soon since they're both on the rebound, but I think they'd be great together.  Hopefully it won't take 10 years like it has for Ross and Rachel on Friends!
