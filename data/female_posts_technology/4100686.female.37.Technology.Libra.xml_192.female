Still, I don't like that the show drips with liberalism, though I've come to expect that, what with all the necessary assumptions of the average Western/secular mindset, trumpeted day in and day out and taught day in and day out.  For example: If you're against the way we're fighting the War on Terrorism, you must therefore be pro-abortion, pro-gay marriage, etc. On the other hand, if you favor helping the environment, spending money not on silly foreign adventures but on healthcare, public works, education, etc., and so on, then you must be a brand of Communist. Marxist, Leninist, Stalinist, Maoist, Socialist. Who knew the Red Menace could offer as many choices as a supermarket aisle?   I guess i'm not the only one tired of all the "lefties" versus "righties" gawd-have-we-not-got-tired-of-this-yet baiting. I wonder at the web, it's almost as if it is full of navelgazers with the propensity for going to war on the basis of bellybutton shape. "Innies United" against the "Outies Front". But then again, perhaps  urlLink Edna  has a better idea of what it is really full off.  Hmm now moderation, that has a certain timeless fashion appeal, like a pair of good shoes, might cost more in the short term, but in the long term keeps your feet dry, is enduringly elegant, and goes with almost any outfit.   Update;    urlLink Avari-Nameh  also has an interesting blogroll, worth clicking around, i'm going back to have another look...
