He groaned, pulling her closer to his body, holding her closely.  She moaned quietly in the back of her throat as she tightened her arms around his neck, wanting him, wanting more.  She loved the taste of his mouth on hers, the feel of his hands roaming her body, the feel of his body pressed tightly into hers.  She never wanted this night to stop.  She wanted to stay right here in his arms forever and a day.  She thanked the goddesses everyday for the love of her life.  She knew he was her soulmate traveling through the years always finding each other each generation.  He thrust his tongue into her mouth, claiming her heart and soul.  She yearned for his touch, his kiss.    All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003
