So we went to T.O. to see Pennywise and to watch fireworks...well we sort of saw Pennywise and really didn't see any fireworks.  Al, Jamie, Ben, Keith and I spent the day in T.O. and that was awesome but then it came time to watch the fireworks thinking that, as the ticket said, Pennywise started at 10:30pm.  So we are waiting for the 10pm fireworks to start and they didn't so the closer to 10:30 it came the more antsy we all got.  So we left there and walked to the Kool Haus to find out that Pennywise started at 10.  SO after getting a little pissed off we went in and enjoyed the rest of the show.  They totally covered a Nirvana song and dedicated it to Kurt Cobain...that was awesome! So to make the day a little worse Fletcher(one of the guys in the band) couldn't get across the border so he wasn't there...but to make the day a little better, we really didn't miss any of the songs we wanted to see.  So I guess all and all everything was pretty cool!   I still missed my fireworks though and had to settle with July 4th fireworks on TV :(
