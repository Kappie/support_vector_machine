Although I usually use it as a tablet, detached from the keyboard, I've been having to utilize the keyboard more often in the past couple of days, as I'm sort of under the weather right now.  And the function key is in the control key's place.  And I'm a big control key person.    Please, no comments about me being a control person...  I'm sick, remember?  Anyway, to better illustrate my problem, instead of typing in "amazon" and hitting control and enter, I'm hitting function and enter.  And it  just doesn't work.  So if anyone can reprogram this keyboard to switch those two buttons, I'd appreciate it.  OK, gonna see what TiVo has recorded for me.  Either that or break out the  urlLink Coupling  DVDs.
