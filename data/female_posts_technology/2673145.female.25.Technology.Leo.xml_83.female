Work: A new testing cycle started and that means I've stuff to do again. Actually, it's irresponsible of me to say that I've nothing to do cos it is my job to find things to do. I needed something to start my engine running, and while it is running, I'll be motivated enough to find things to do. I cannot tolerate "off-peak" seasons when I wonder each morning what's there to accomplish. I think I should set deadlines for the tasks on hand, cos deadlines give me pressure, and that's what I need to keep moving. In 3 1/2 weeks I'll know my future in the company. It is their deadline and mine to decide if my contract with them terminates in July or in another 2 yrs. I am not hoping for the best or preparing for the worst. I'll take it as it come. God has plans for me. I will handle whatever situation he put me in. So exciting! ^o^  Money: Well, I have to tighten my belt, hold my purse strings tight cos what I have now will have to last me longer then usual. Being a spend thrift, I can't help pampering myself once a while. Just a couple of days ago, I spent about $5 more for lunch (which is usually $2-3). That will probably be the last time until I get another pay check or strike the lottery.   Health: I'm recovering! Yippee. My teeth and gum were aching because of my sinus. I was told that I was having virus infectious, rather then flu since it has been more then 2 weeks. So I'm on antibiotics now and that helped cleared my throat and nose. My left cheek (the sinus) still aches sometimes but I'm just glad that I'm not coughing like I'm choking. My list of cravings is expanding and I need to recover soon!  Love: I've written everything abt this topic. My opinions are still unchanged. No new developments as yet. =) Mum is still as concern why I'm not meeting more friends, finding a boyfriend. Should have told her that my friends are mostly guys and there's only 1 or 2 gals. A colleague told me to change myself to appeal to more guys (or that one guy of interest). Firstly, it is certainly not my character to do that. I can't pretend and changing takes a helluva time. Secondly, what are the things that most guys look for in a gal? Aren't they boobs and butts? Haha.  Family: "The crisis" is still going on. I don't know if there's any improvement but we've got some external help to assist. My dad is getting impatient and frustrated. My mum got hints of it and she's very cooperating. As for the siblings, worried, impatient, and wondering when will it come to a conclusion. We are all praying very hard. (Which reminds me to go to church tmr, to fulfil the deal i struck with God.)  I just got an idea for blog. =D Until then, take care, good luck, love one another (including ur enemy) and I love you.
