The theme this time around is "The Gardens of Camelot". I wasn't as impressed as the last time but they still put up a good show I thought.   urlLink    I took a few shots of some english garden landscape but some didn't turn out very well. Just love the blue hydrangeas on this one!   urlLink    Budz scopin'...   urlLink    ...there were some cool rock gardens...    urlLink    ...and some interesting looking plants.
