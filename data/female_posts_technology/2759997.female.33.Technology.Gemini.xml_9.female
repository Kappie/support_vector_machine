So I tried it.  And, I tried to stump it (because I'm the type of person who enjoys  breaking things  a challenge).  Here's what Google told me:  If there were additional members of the Beatles, one of them would be named  urlLink "Volkswagen" .   It recognized that Purdue, Indiana, Ball State, and Notre Dame were universities in the state of Indiana and provided me with a list of other Indiana-based universities.   Chianti, Sauvignon Blanc, and Merlot stumped the "small set" search, and the "large set" contained several countries.  I'd hate to drink a bottle of Greece.   I really need to get a life...
