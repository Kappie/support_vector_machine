I am sure the main course didn't reach my viscerals, anyhow I didn't bother raiding the fridge when I got home! I need the NEEDED diet. Nonetheless, my time with my friend Pat was marvelous.  We talked randomly. Her family holiday in Spain, mine in Greece.... her sister from Florida visited.... our work and the omniprescence of these assumably control-freak bitches, who can't seem to get a life outside their fantasy workplace.... our DutchMEN and I won't further comment because my Dutchman knows this site and he might hack it down! * Tremble *... our un-never-finished houses (her daughter called that the sink again dripped!)... and of course what we want as  wimin .  I think flying to  New York  with her is an exciting idea, in fact she would be the best person to travel with since she lived and worked there for more than half of her life's existence on this planet earth! She did want us to go visit  London  but helaas, I am not so feverish about it. Golly, I was just there 2 months ago, but next year would be a different scoop. I can just imagine: " Girl's Night Out ". To top it all, it's just an hour flight from Amsterdam ;-).  Maybe I will bring Dutchman to this DJANGO restaurant.
