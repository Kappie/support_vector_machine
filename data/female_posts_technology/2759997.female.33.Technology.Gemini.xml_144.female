So I was pretty proud of myself when I figured out how to work around the biggest "flaw" (imho) with Gmail: not being able to save a draft.  The main reason I want to save a draft is because I start to reply to a message and end up being interrupted, or know I need to reply, but I'm not ready to reply... and sometimes it might take me several hours before I have completed my response.   I'm rambling.  Anyway...  If I have the reply open for 3 hours, I can't see when I have received new mail.    My solution:  press shift as you click "reply" and open it in a new window.  Pretty clever, huh?  I think I'm far too easily entertained.  ;)
