I skimmed it that day and took some really good ideas from it. There are a lot of things I've been doing, or thinking of doing, that really only serve to sabotage my healing process. I'm quite guilty of constantly checking up on M, even just to drive by his house to see if his car is parked there. I contimplated calling one of his friends to dig for information, I'm glad I didn't.  So then Saturday I threw a party to celebrate my 25th birthday. I surrounded myself with friends, family, and coworkers and drank way too much. It was a blast and I feel so much better about myself, not that I usually have a problem feeling good about myself.   Sunday was mostly spent recovering from Saturday. I drove a friend home and on my way back, driving through the countryside, I wept for the four great years that are now at an end. I sobbed and wailed remembering how M used to read to me in the park. It's hard to describe how I felt, I don't think it was sadness or despair, it was just release.
