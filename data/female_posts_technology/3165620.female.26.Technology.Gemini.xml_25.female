I'll need to give some sort of documentation showing that I have been inoculated against rubella. I know I had to show that I was before I went to college, but it wasn't quite clear what would be acceptable, so I may have to get a blood test to convince the state that I won't be catching German measles and bearing deformed children.  It wasn't clear what identification we would need to present to get a marriage license. I know that Kirstin had to update her driver's license before she could get one, but I don't know if that was because she had an old name on it or if they are picky about the address given. I'll need to find out so we can make a trip to the MVD and officially become New Mexican drivers if we need to.  What county should we get the license from, since we don't live in Indiana ourselves? Does it matter?  Next time I chat with Mom, I'll ask her to look into any of this stuff that I can find out with some more in-depth searching from here.
