Yeah we have 2 shows coming up and no drummer! I am so aggravated w/ this it's not even funny. We practiced last night to do the show acoustically, but I am really torn right now.  To the point that I got very little sleep. I really don't want to do this show under these circumstances, but I don't want to abandon the guys cause this has nothing to do w/ them. WELCOME TO RAWK AND ROLL baby! Jake said if we need a drummer, he could fit in a few practices to do the 22 show, but the 14 is a no go. John is doing everything in his power to fix this, but it's not him that needs to fix this.... JEFF? Yeah, I have already decided that I can't and won't work w/ him. What to do? I need to sit and make a decision about a couple of things pertaining to this band.  I just need some sleep.
