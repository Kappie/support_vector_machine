"Very embarrassing. I am not a happy camper over this"   "based on the data we had within the report, there was a suggestion that the number of incidents had dropped and it was the lowest since 1969," he added. "That turns out not to have been correct. We were wrong. We will correct it"   How very convenient;   When the annual report was issued April 29, senior administration officials used it as evidence the war was being won under Bush.    Surely, if the war is being so well won then it might be time to send some of those poor tired troopers home. But no, the soldiers must stay put because now the report is to be corrected to show that the world needs them in action!   "We weren't saying terrorism has gone away. The report clearly says terrorism is a main problem facing the world today. We've got to continue going after terrorists," Powell said.    Apparently the CIA helped to compile the data.    "There's a new terrorist threat information center that compiles this data under the CIA. And we are still trying to determine what went wrong with the data and why we didn't catch it in the State Department," Powell said Sunday.    Perhaps the CIA need to read their newspaper clippings more carefully.   urlLink Abbas  noticed  urlLink first.
