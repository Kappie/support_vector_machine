Ihave not yet cheated onmy diet.... on my home scale I weigh 4 lbs less I am feeling great !!!!!!  I was talking to andrew yday he said if i have lost weight by this stupid diet than I should continue rather than stop and start and confuse my body I came home and told my hubby and brother surprisingly they agreed to that they said continue for couple more weeks until you feel you cant take it any more so by popular demand ladies you will see me cating Cabbage soup for next couple of weeks(hope not) or if I get tired I will skip the soup and continue rest of diet!!!(fruits ,veggies and banan,,,,,,,,, NO RICE AND FRIED FOOD AND POTATOES) No exercise today but I was doing laundry up and down to basement I dunno how many times , went shopping for about 3 hrs I hope I had some exercise there
