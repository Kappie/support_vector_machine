They didn't expect anything from the dwarves since their only concern is mining. But still they had to try.   "Do I have to be the one who has to tell them?" Bardric said as he slipped down from the dragon's back.  "Yes." Trellian smiled as he watched Bardric suffer.  "Why can't you do it? I talked to everyone else." Bardric said defensively.  "Because I can't fit inside the small cave entrance as well as their hallways." Trellian replied as he pushed the wizard toward the entrance with a talon.  Bardric sighed. "It's a good thing I like you a little bit." Bardric straightened up and marched toward the entrance. It's always good to make a good impression with the dwarves.  As he approached, two of the rocks shifted and moved. Bardric looked closer. Dwarves camouflaged as rocks. He couldn't even see them until they moved. How ingenious.   "Well, what do ya want?" The black-bearded dwarf on the right asked.  Bardric had to strain his ears and filter the accent just to make the words out clearly. "I must tell the King that the Drakken are back in the lands causing mischief." Bardric puffed out his chest with all the importance he could muster.  "The King already knows this so ya may not enter." The red-bearded dwarf on the left answered waving his battle ax.  "If the King already knows then I will not bother you further. Please send the regards of Bardric, the wizard to his Kingship, Thain." Bardric turned and walked away.
