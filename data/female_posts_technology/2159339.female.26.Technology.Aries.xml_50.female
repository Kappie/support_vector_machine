I don't like taking out the trash either. These tasks are unrewarding and do not end in orgasms, brain or vaginal. Yesterday night I again tackled the insurmountable duty of doing dishes because earlier in the day Dizzy D faux-casually asked, "So when are you going to finish doing the dishes?" (I've been chipping away at the mountain for a few weeks now.) I glared at him and declared it was a work-in-progress. I don't eat at home, so they're all his dirty diddies anyway. And they keep piling on! They don't stop accumulating!! I am going postal, but worse: I'm going "kitchen-al"!!!   After one load, I was impatient and frustrated at how little I'd actually finished compared to the remaining dishes that I decided that it was time to start taking shots. I drank two shots of vermouth, turned up the music, and tried to boogie away my woes. I finished another load and sighed at the sight of the Sisyphean task ahead of me. The vermouth wasn't enough. I took off the rubber gloves and lay down, defeated. I could not finish. And the sad thing is that the next time I muster up the courage to tackle the dishes again, there will be so many added that it'll be like I didn't even do any at all.   Also, one complaint. One domestic squabble. One glimpse into my private life. When Dizzy D cooks, he likes to eat -as he calls it- "Chinese style" in that he will serve and present all dinner items in separate bowls and dishes. Even when he eats alone. There will be a small bowl for the kimchee, and a tiny bowl for the soy sauce, and a bowl for the vegetables, and a bowl for the rice, and a bowl for the meat. And the bowl from which he eats. That's six bowls! For one person! Why doesn't he just get all his food straight from the pot/jar and put it into his bowl? Why the middlemen? Why the bowls in-between?* This, THIS, is the source of my angst river, ladies and gentlemen. And I can take it no more.   *(I have asked him these questions and he gave some answer along the lines of, "But, it's Chinese-style!" Ugh. One day I will convert him to the highly efficient way of "Batty Trough Style.")
