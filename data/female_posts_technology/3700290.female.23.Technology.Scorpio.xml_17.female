Okie...not master...but at least pick the language up as fast as possible.  Linda was passing the remark that I am very skinny. Indeed I know that I am but I think I have grown used and tired of my own skinniness that I did not do much abt it. I was walking home when I started to measure my left wrist with my right fingers...I have grown thinnier indeed! Damn...I wld have to eat carefully these days and make myself grow fatter. This wld be a difficult task...bearing in mind that I AM saving up for my UK trip next year! Haizzz...  Went to Chinatown and shopped for clothings for next yr's trip (a bit ks lah) but then we realised there were not much discounts and so we din buy ANYTHING... We came to a conclusion that we have to buy: a pair of gloves,thermal wear, jacket and cap...
