Her mom will be so mad that she will be grounded for at least a week.    She ran up the steps to the back porch.  She hoped she could sneak into the bathroom and wash off before getting caught.  She looked up at the screen door and reached her hand out to the handle when she noticed the shadowy figure.  "Oh hi Mom,"  Alecka said lamely as she took a step back from the door.  "What happened this time?  Why are you so covered with mud?"  Her Mom came out onto the porch for a better look at her muddy daughter.  "Nothing Mom,"  Alecka looked down at her shoes as she replied.  She couldn't face her mom with the truth that the kids at school pushed her down into the mud.  After she got up, they threw mud balls at her making things even worse.   "Well start taking off your shoes and socks and anything else you can spare.  I'll grab a towel for you hide behind so you can take the rest off.  I will not have you come into the house with all of that mud.  You will then wash off and come down to eat.  It's a good thing I was a little late in starting supper so it won't be cold by the time you are finished."  Alecka hurried and took off her shoes and socks.  She took off her jacket which took the most damage.  Her shirt for the most part still looked blue instead of muddy brown.  Her Mom came back silently and held the towel up so she could take off her shorts.  Alecka ran into the house and up the stairs without looking back.  She hurried into her bedroom and grabbed some clothes before heading for the shower.  The shower seemed to wash much of the bad feelings away as well as the mud.  She felt cleansed again in a way that made her happy to be home.  Unfortunately she had to jump out and make her way downstairs for a very uncomfortably silent meal with her Mom.    "Well sit down and start eating." Her Mom said as Alecka appeared in the kitchen doorway.    Alecka sat down quickly looking at the menu of corn, chicken, mashed potatoes, and gravy.  Her favorite food.  Mom sat down across from her and sat their drinks in front of their plates.  "Dig in before it gets cold.  Eat as much as you like.  You know how much I hate left overs.  I don't know why I made so much tonight.  You would think I was expecting company or something."  Her Mom shook her head as she spooned some corn onto her plate.  "The last time you did this, Mom, Grandma came to stay for a while." Alecka commented as she forked a piece of chicken onto her plate with the mashed potatoes and gravy.  At that precise moment the doorbell rang loudly through the house.  Mom sighed and placed her utensils on the table.  "That would be your Grandmother.  Wait here and I'll bring her back.  Can you grab another plate?"
