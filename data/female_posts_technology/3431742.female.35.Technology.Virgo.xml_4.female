Not sure why. I have two cats and they are awesome.  I mean I really like coming home to them very similar to those that like going home to their kids.  Mostly because these are my kids. Since work normally has me sooooo busy I go online about every two days or so.  Mostly to check my email and that's about it.  If someone starts chatting with me then I'll be on a bit longer.  As long as I can chat and check stuff out then I'll be online.  Otherwise; I'd get offline. A little later on I'll be heading over to the grandfolks place and help dad get his van from stinking and loading up fishing gear.  I guess he'll go fishing sometime this week with some folks or something.  At least he can still do that.
