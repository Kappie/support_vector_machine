(to our smallest parts)  I came across this after looking at Air America Radio page, and it is the type of thing that drives me mad. We know about a man, well before his election to the position, and yet the bureacracy that is supposed to help us has kept our hands tied, rather than to ensure that we are being "watched out for"  I am spitting mad about or urlLink Our new CIA cheif.  But I'm left feeling like "What can I do?"
