These are direct quotes from people in the courtroom.  You probably received this list by e-mail. Still, I laugh each time I read it. And, that's the purpose of being in my break room.       Q: What is your date of birth?       A: July 15th.       Q: What year?       A: Every year.        Q: What gear were you in at the moment of the impact?       A: Gucci sweats and Reeboks.        Q: This myasthenia gravis, does it affect your memory at all?       A: Yes.       Q: And in what ways does it affect your memory?       A: I forget.       Q: You forget. Can you give us an example of something that you've forgotten?        Q: How old is your son, the one living with you?       A: Thirty-eight or thirty-five, I can't remember which.

Q: And why did that upset you?       A: My name is Susan.        Q: Now doctor, isn't it true that when a person dies in his sleep, he doesn't know about it until the next morning?         Q: The youngest son, the twenty-year-old, how old is he?        Q: Were you present when your picture was taken?        Q: So the date of conception (of the baby) was August 8th?       A: Yes.

A: He was about medium height and had a beard.       Q: Was this a male, or a female?        Q: Is your appearance here this morning pursuant to a deposition notice which I sent to your attorney?       A: No, this is how I dress when I go to work.        Q: Doctor, how many autopsies have you performed on dead people?       A: All my autopsies are performed on dead people.         Q: All your responses must be oral, OK? What school did you go to?       A: Oral.        Q: Do you recall the time that you examined the body?       A: The autopsy started around 8:30 p.m.       Q: And Mr. Dennington was dead at the time?       A: No, he was sitting on the table wondering why I was doing an autopsy.        Q: Doctor, before you performed the autopsy, did you check for a pulse?       A: No.       Q: Did you check for blood pressure?       A: No.       Q: Did you check for breathing?       A: No.       Q: So, then it is possible that the patient was alive when you began the autopsy?       A: No.       Q: How can you be so sure, Doctor?       A: Because his brain was sitting on my desk in a jar.       Q: But could the patient have still been alive, nevertheless?       A: Yes, it is possible that he could have been alive and practicing law somewhere.     The last two are my favorites.
