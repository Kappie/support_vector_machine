The website encourages  people to  Read ,  Register , and then  Release   their books "into the wild" and then track where they go and the  lives they touch. Great concept... share your books and follow  their progress forever. Best of all, it's  FREE .   Help spread the word by forwarding this to your friends, and  of course be sure to visit     www.BookCrossing.com  !    Personal message from Brooke:  After recently picking up a lot of material for $2/bag at the big library booksale, I've decided I should start using my bookcrossing account again. Many of these books will be appreciated much more by letting other people have them than by just sitting in a box or on a shelf in my apartment.
