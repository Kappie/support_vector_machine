GK, is a lying liar who tells lies, and that his dictatorship, like so many others, is corrupt and full of injustice of all the freedoms granted to users of a message board. The unfortunate Hell from which he practices his power is called COWD, short for the Crazy Old Wizard's Domain. This board had---and still has---it's promises, and I have nothing against the board itself, nor does Proxima himself or the rest of his other staff members. It's just unfortunate that others still are under GK's harrassment.   What is fortunate, though, is that so far the Star Trek Community board (Proxima's board, which I am a mod at) has not been directly attacked recently. That is to say, GK's minions haven't stormed in and stuck their unwelcome noses in our business. Notice I said "recently". I know that Proxima is still getting crap from GK and his favorite DoctorSyn lately, ever since I checked his blog.   GK was even daring enough to bring up his own Star Trek board just to rival us. AdmiralMudd has decided to give GK a kick-in-the-crotch type of revenge by starting up his own board to make the compitition even worse. Luckily the good Admiral is one of us, and he will make an EzRing and a living hell even bigger for GK. All proceeds are welcome to the fund. ^_^  GK is most notorious for his dictator-like habits. He is known to ban people associated with other people he greatly dislikes (i.e. Proxima). He bullies members, sends out his staff to bully them further, and all at the same time making these people kiss his ass. If you so much as disagree with GK for something, he'll have his family bash you. This---and other sad examples---are the reason that many of his members have left him, and even a few members of his staff have begun to question their loyalty to him, since he is such an asshole to go as far as to beat down on them, too.   I know Proxima has more to say on GK and his evil regime, but that's another story and another blog.    ~Juno~ Current Mood: ANNOYED BUT...HAPPY    Some Good Clean Fun   The latest Newsweek made a chart refering to some bad, bad villians in our movie history, and here is their list of a few. I found it interesting, so I'll list and maybe give some thoughts. I put a few things that they said in the summary; the rest is mine.    Dr. No:  Yep, Agent 007's nemesis and starter. Tries to mess up the U.S. space program with missles. Very cold war. You'd think he'd learn his lesson with explosives. Naughty.    Ernst Stavro Blofeld:  Another Bond movie baddie. Couldn't get enough shiny things. Uses a killer laser satillite, which could totally happen today.    Scaramanga:  Yet another 007 nemesis. Love this guy since he's an assassin with a passion. Has a gun that can kill with one shot. Guess what color it is. His evil plan? Obtaining the Solex Agitator, which sounds like a fancy watch but is actually a device that turns the sun's radiation deadly. Well, when was it not?    Lex Luthor:  Perhaps the most notorious of all the megavillians and is also the dumpiest, if possible. He didn't care about taking over the world, he just wanted to kill Superman, which takes lots of kryptonite. Now he could just go on Ebay.    Max Zorin:  A loony French tycoon (Zorin is French?) with yellow hair and a supermodel chick. He's greedy 80's style: wants to detonate Silicon Valley, cause an earthquake, corner microchip market. Yeah, that'll work. Sure thing.    The Joker:  A criminal psychopath who falls into a vat of acid and comes out of it exactly the same way, only happier. His idea? Selling a line of cosmetics that's actually a lethal gas called Smilex. No animal testing! It causes cancer in rats.    The Penguin:  Abandoned by his parents because he was a really, really ugly baby. His only friends were penguins. Nice. He aims to hijack the mayoral election and install a crook. When that fails, he goes Biblical and tries to kidnap every firstborn son in Gotham. Time to get out the penguin's blood.    Dr. Evil:  Possibly the most comical of the group (beats the Joker), he is a cryogenically unfrozen villian who plots world domination with his cat, Mr. Bigglesworth, and his number two, Number Two. He's an oldie but a goodie: He steals a nuclear weapon (from Kreplakistan) and holds the world ransom for...ONE MEEL-LLION DOLLARS!    Magneto:  He's a mutant who's egar to wage war with nonmutants. His body is a magnet. O. The evil plan is...*drum roll*...to create a device to turn normal folks into mutants, and plans to use it on the world leaders at Ellis Island. Moral: racism=very, very bad.    The Green-Goblin:  The mad scientist that flies around on a stupid glider. When his super soldier project goes sour, he goes mad, starts talking to himself, puts on the suit and attacks Spidey. Tool.   I've added some that I've experienced in games and other such things. My own additions include:    Andross (from the Star Fox games):  Dr. Andross was a brilliant Cornerian scientist who went insane when his weaponry projects were turned down by the government due to the times of peace. So he unleashes his "weapons" among the citizens of Corneria, gets exiled to this hell planet called Venom, and strikes up an army (don't ask how) and attacks the Lylat System, planet by planet. So Star Fox has to stop him. What a bad, bad monkey.    Wolf O'Donnell (from the Star Fox games):  The least wimpy of the Star Wolf team and the Star Fox team's nemesis, Wolf is a cold...well, wolf...with an eyepatch and an attitude. Plans to take out Fox McCloud and his comrades before they get to Andross and destroy the plan. What a smart thing to do.    Lord Voldemort (from the Harry Potter series):  Now this guy's bad-to-tha-bone. Rises again and tries to kill off all the Muggles and non-pure bloods. Goody, and when he's done, let's have him take a census.    Darth Vader (from the Star Wars series):  I'm surprised this dude didn't make the list. He was as bad as bad comes. Okay, c'mon, he's a good-guy-gone-bad-guy-gone-good-guy again. Who doesn't love that? *wheezing*    Ganondorf (from the Legend of Zelda series) : This guy is a dark, dark guy...with red hair and pale-like skin. And yellow eyes. Has the Triforce of Power and has to share it with Link, who has the Triforce of Courage, and Princess Zelda, who has the Triforce of Wisdom. What happens when they clash? *rubs hands* A lotta chaos.   There are others, of course. Who can't resist an evil guy with an insane evil plan and crazy hair?    The Cold Front   Why is it so frickin' cold outside? It's suppost to be June and 80 something, not 50 something! Jeez laweez! I've never experienced anything like this. It's never been so chilly before, and the only time it was actually hot outside was the other day. But like everyone says, "There's no place like Nebraska." Damn right. >_   ~Valkyrie Juno signing off~
