       
      This week has seemed longer than usual, and I know it's not just work (although, my last true day off was when I went to the Preds game on April 3rd).  The weekend won't be any different.  Big bowling plans this evening (let's see if I can break 100), go to work tomorrow AM, get to E in time to get a seat for the game, meet up with friends afterwards, go home and crash, try to enjoy Sunday (that reminds me - stop on the way home Saturday PM for some orange juice...  I think I'm still ok with champagne), and maybe find some time to take care of myself...
