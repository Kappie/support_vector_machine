But if you see the one for  Skydive Las Vegas  up there; let me tell you this: they suck. Why?  urlLink Because of this policy . They are what we call a Tandem Factory. If you feel like doing a tandem, go to a drop zone that does not ban experienced jumpers. Tandems in my opinion do not give you the real experience of skydiving - it's even worse if all you do is go to a drop zone and meet no one but other tandem passengers. At least at a normal drop zone you might pick up what a little more of what skydiving is about.  SLV's owner has every right to run his dz the way he see fits. I just think it sucks. EOM.
