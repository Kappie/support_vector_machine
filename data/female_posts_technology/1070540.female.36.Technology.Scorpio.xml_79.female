We will have 1 in high school. 1 in middle school and 2 in Elementary. I know I use to say I want a baby. Now dont get me wrong, I wish I did have kens baby. But our kids are growing up, so we dont really need one, and with what we both have gone through to get where we are, has been hetic. We are a perfect family (ok...so nothing is perfect) like we are now! MY gosh my baby is in the 1st grade!  They are getting too big
