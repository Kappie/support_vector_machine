This went from signing up on a lark in the middle of the week to suddenly having a full party of at least 15 people; we've got some work to do to reconfigure the place to fit that many people but I guess the 84" diagonal screen on our projection system did it...  The previous weekend we participated in a MoveOn.org call-a-thon in an attempt to register as many new voters as possible. Our little group registered six new voters (including the pizza guy who delivered our dinner :) - hey, you get them any way you can!) and it seems overall nationwide we registered 10,000 new voters. And that doesn't include the tons of messages we left on peoples' answering machines; I wonder what kind of effect that has? Hope they have more call-a-thons like this!  I also did most of the shopping necessary to start my new business. Found a small desk, bookcase/storage unit, filing cabinet, etc. that will all fit comfortably into a 12' x 12 1/2' room. I prefer starting off small, and I wouldn't mind staying like this for quite awhile since the executive suites I picked already have a shared reception/waiting area. The initial overhead in running a business like this (successfully) is not trivial. I also have to work on getting an establishment license and occupational license.
