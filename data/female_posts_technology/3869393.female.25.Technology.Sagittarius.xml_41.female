If you do good, people will accuse you of selfish ulterior motives. Do good ANYWAY.  If you are successful, you will win false friends and the enemies. Succeed ANYWAY.  Honesty and frankness make you vulnerable. Be honest and frank ANYWAY.  The good you do today will be forgotten tomorrow. Be good ANYWAY.  The biggest people with the biggest ideas can be shot down by the smallest people with the smallest minds. Think big ANYWAY.  People favour underdogs but follow only top dogs. Fight for some under dogs ANYWAY.  What you spend years building may be destroyed overnight. Build ANYWAY.  Give the world the best you have and you’ll get kicked in the teeth. Give the world the best you’ve got...ANYWAY.
