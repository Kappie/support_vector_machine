He's been working overtime and then on the weekends, we've had plans with people. So, friday night was just us, and then all saturday.  Nice.  We spent the time watching some flicks:   Bourne Supremacy ...Not as good as the first one. I felt misled by a lot critics praising it and hailing it as the best action-thriller they've seen in years.  I usually tune into  urlLink Rotten Tomatoes  and it got very good reviews. Not that it was bad, just not as good as the first one. And I got a headache from some of the camera work. Why are critics often times off the mark from the general public viewer's views?    Moulin Rouge ...Loved it! This is not for every musical fan. But I really loved it. I thought Nicole Kidman was a bit of an odd choice for the role of Satine, in an "against type" kinda way, but it worked. Its a very odd ball kind of movie, but I really enjoyed it.   Girl with a Pearl Earring ...Slow, not a lot of moving and shaking goin on, but I love Scarlett Johannesen (sp?) and Colin Firth. I've loved Mr. Firth since I saw him in Bridget Jone's diary and then after that on BBC's mini-series production of  Pride and Prejucide .     Sweethest Thing ...I think the  idea  behind it was cool. That of showing women on the hunt for a mate instead of the usual men. But it was missing a lot of things. I love Ms. Diaz, but I hate to admit it, she can't carry a movie without a male lead or othe strong female actresses (I'm thinking of Drew Barrymore and the kickass Lucy Liu in the 1st Charlie's Angels).    Aside from being a movie-phile this weekend, I also visited my family on Sunday. We had a Karaoke session to the max! I got to sing Desperado....i sounded better without the  mike  mic.
