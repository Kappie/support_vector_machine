George Lorimer 1867-1937, Editor of "Saturday Evening Post"   Volunteerism, a act of committing time towards a project benefitting others who need assistance -- making ends meet, feeding a family, fighting for their own rights, etc.  God mentions throughout the Bible to "work hard"; however, does that necessarily mean working hard only if you get paid for it?  I don't think so.  I believe that while money is a necessary evil to get exist in this world (ensuring a roof over the head, food on the table, etc.), it isn't meant to be everything.  "Working hard" to me also includes looking out for one's neighbors and community.  It surprises to me how many people you ask to help in a particular situation ask if they will get compensated in some way for helping and/or ask what will they benefit from it.  To me, it is not a matter of what I will benefit from it; but, rather, how can I best benefit others.  The greatest pleasure can be obtained from helping others -- and no money can ever buy that.  I guess that I just can't comprehend such a response since I have volunteered many, many hours to political campaigns; being an advocate and voice for abused, neglected and abandoned children (as a  urlLink CASA  and Guardian ad Litem volunteer); being an advocate and voice for the elderly (as a  urlLink Family Eldercare  volunteer); being an advocate and voice for the abused, neglected and abandoned women and children (as a Crisis Center volunteer); being a delegate to another country for assistance with their programs to those trying to improve their quality of lives (through the Presbyterian Missionary Program); and so many other opportunities.  If you haven't ever volunteered, I would suggest you contacting your Church, local  urlLink Red Cross , and other non-profit organizations to see where your best fit might be.  If you still have not a clue, you can also go online and sites, such as  urlLink Volunteer Match  or  urlLink Taking It Global  (for a more universal approach) will aid in matching you up with a best fit scenario before you lose out in not realzing during your lifetime the things that money can't buy in a million years!! :)
