As I read one post that was posted by one of them, I was saddened and "jealous" of the fact that the closest pal that I had in my nus days was still a firm friend with her. They still managed to keep a sms-rally when she don't even bother to sms me once unless she faced some problems...I guess I just have to face the fact that friends do come and go...    ***    Initially, I had the feeling that Linda was putting me down when she told me that I should not pushed myself so hard to complete the task given by Bill. However, I guess what she said was rather true as all I had in return was the compliment "Good work done." Maybe I should not have so much expectations at first... high expectations usually result in higher disappointment....    ***    On a brighter note, I saw a shop in my neighbourhood selling 6230 at $398! That is soooo much cheaper than the usual retail price. From what I saw from the signboard, the conditions are about the same as the conditions posted by the usual retail shops. I will keep my fingers crossed. Hopefully it is such the case and I shall buy the phone at a cheaper price then!    My enterprising spirit rose as my financial situation got worse. As I finally got the hang of using yahoo auction (I bought an outdated calculator from there), I decided to auction some of my unused objects off... I took some photos of my clothes with my bro's digital camera and will post them in net later on. ; )
