We spent New Year's Eve at my aunt's house. Good food, good champagne, good margaritas.  Slept over at my mom's and chatted with her a little in the morning.  She worked last night.  At midnight I started calling all people to greet them New Year.  Friends included Tony, and sis-in-law H.  H was working too.  Sad.  We were supposed to go party hopping. I wanted to visit S's party but she lived about 1 1/2 hr away from my aunt's house.  Also wanted to visit Tony's little get-together at his house.  Ended up watching a marathon of Friends season 1 on DVD and Finding Nemo.  It ended up being an okay nite, especially with husband, dad and bros with me. Once again, Happy New Year everybody.  Challenge up ahead: Cleaning the old apartment  Topics coming soon: New Year's resolution.
