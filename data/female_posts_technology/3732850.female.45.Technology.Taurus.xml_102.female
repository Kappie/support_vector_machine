Because they want to have you side with them. Which I think is wrong because how can we as a society make a fair judgement when we are only hearing half of the story. Even on talk shows people like to argue I think somethings they do this just to get attention. Why would you want to argue just to argue. It is a waste of time and of energy. And after a while no one wants to listen to you because all you want to do to them is have a fight and this is not right to the other person or people involved. We all argue. But arguing all the time is not good for your selfesteam and it make make people around you negative also. It can lead to anxity, depression, spouse abuse, child abuse and much more. I think this is one of the main problems in are society to day is that we can't talk problems out without someone yelling at the other person and this hurts everyone involved not just the people who are disagreing with each other.
