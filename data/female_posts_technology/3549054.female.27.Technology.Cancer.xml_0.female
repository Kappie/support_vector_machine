Having spent my childhood amongst my Grandparents, Great Grandmother, Uncles and Aunts, he word YAATRA was heard very frequently. The elders used to speak of their journies to the places of spiritual importance. India is having many such places. And as far as I remember, many of our elders made tripsto Kasi and Rameswaram. I remember my Granny, a 86 year old lady now, saying about her mothers journies to Hialayas when that lady was in 70's.   Well, I always used to think that making a Yaatra means travelling to places of spiritual importance.I used to dream of goign to sch places and explore those places which were written as invisble to Human's eye.  As I grew up, I realiaed that different meanings of the word. I realised that the way we lead our life is itself a big journey. We start somewhere and end up somewhere. We meet many people, some influence us, we hate some, and in the process, our own self goes a change. It gets moulded slowly into a shape. And here, we are not moulding, but letting ourselves moulded through some xternal force, the force that is unseen normally. But, when we try to discover it, we find this force in the form of our parents, our friends, our colleagues, our wellwishers, and all our loved ones.  Religious Scripts say that God Creates Man. But, I believe that he just creates a Half Moulded shape and fills it with life. Its up to that person to gain a shape, to attach soul to his life, and make that soul grow along wth his body. And this is what I call as Yaatra for a Human. It starts with Birth and ends with Death. And in the mean time, we thread along different paths, meet different people, and gain a lot of knowledge and wisdom.  While this is the bakground for the title, I happened to observe many lives, and whenever I observe anything, a thought arises in me. I am planning to put in my observations here, about myself as well as human race in general. Comments and suggestions and most important critical reviews are welcome. Cos, I am still travelling and not yet a soul of fine shape.
