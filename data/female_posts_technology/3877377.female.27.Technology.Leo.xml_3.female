This doesn't mean that you aren't funny; it just means that people may not be in the mood to laugh. Ridiculous as it may seem, today is simply a better day to cry. Let all your pent up emotions out on the table. Talk it out with the people around you. Your heart is communicating well through you today.   This just be wrong.  Pirates don't cry.   EVER.   Well, maybe at the occasional Hallmark Commercial.
