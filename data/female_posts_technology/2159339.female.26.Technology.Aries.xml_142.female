Also from XX, The Cure b-sides box set!  From other beloved friends: earrings, lace gloves, a red hat, hazelnut chocolate, absolut citron, wine, 1 ticket to  urlLink Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , a clock, socks, bath products, brownies, and everyone's presence at my bday party saturday night. (ho ho, pun intended!) The best gift of all came after all the guests had gone home: 1 comforter and 1 carpet, barf-free.
