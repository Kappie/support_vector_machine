I am 42 years old, and would love to meet someone special. It’s hard enough for me not to get discouraged about dating without everyone asking me about it, as if there is some deep, dark secret to my plight. From my parents, to my co-workers, to my hairstylist, to my dentist, I am constantly asked this question. How can I answer without sounding annoyed, defensive, or depressed? (All of which I am actually feeling, by the way!)  — Bridget in New Hampshire  Dear Bridget, Ah, the eternally annoying question! It should be illegal in 50 states to ask that question, don’t you think? It ranks up there with asking a woman “When is the baby due?” when she’s not actually pregnant.   First of all, don’t assume that someone is asking “Why are you single?” because he or she is looking for your faults, but rather always tell yourself that the question is really meant to imply, “You’re so fantastic! I can’t believe a great guy hasn’t snapped you up yet!” Edit your perception of the question first.   Then you need to answer the question directly with this single sentence: “I just haven’t met the right person yet.” This is a complete sentence. There is no “because…” that trails off the end here. This is not the time to divulge all your issues, quirks, and broken romances.   No matter who asks you, and how annoyed you really are inside, remember to always make lemonade out of lemons. Instead of acting irritated, use this opportunity to probe whether the questioner has someone wonderful to introduce to you. You are speaking to someone who is likely to have a single brother, cousin, neighbor, college roommate, or co-worker, so you need to convey an upbeat, lovely impression of yourself. Who knows what may ensue during the course of a conversation about you being single?    This is my take on the whole thing.  I think you shouldn't "make lemonade out of lemons".  I think you should be real.  People who have no business asking that question ask it.  I've been asked at family gatherings in front of several people.  I agree you shouldn't have a fit because people ask you this, but it is a good idea to let them know that the questioning makes you feel bad.  Be nice, but be real.    What's your take?
