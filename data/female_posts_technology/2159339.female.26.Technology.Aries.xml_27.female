I don't know what to do about rent and feeding the kids, but to take my mind off things, I will focus on the aberration that is Luke of The Sleepy Jackson. He is the strangest, oddest looking fellow I have ever chanced to see. Boyfriend 2 was the ugliest, Luke was the strangest and oddest...  When he took the stage, the first name that popped into my head was "Porky Von Baron". He had a porcine quality because of his dark beady eyes, his piggish nose, and his sausage-like limbs. The more Abby and I tried to compare him to someone or something, more animals than humans came up: pig, lion, seal, walrus, otter. He had a jet-black blown-out lion's mane that recalled early Prince or present-day Michael Jackson: sleek, yet dry and crispy; straight, yet strangely curled at the ends. I imagine that this effect is achieved nightly by a curling iron he drags through each lock to straighten, then rolls in slightly at the end to curl. He holds this iron with his gigantic hands. He also has an enormous head that seems inhumanly gargantuan by his necklessness. Abby pointed out this trait several times, and it was true: he had no neck. It was head, torso. Head... torso. "No pedastal needed, the head will rest just fine on top of the torso, thank you."  His inky hair starkly contrasted with his chalk-white skin. On this ghostly face were black black eyebrows and a black moustache that I presume he buys special dyes for. But not only was he physically bizarre looking, he was strangely styled too. Hence the David Gest comparisons. He wore a huge blazer that only accentuated his huge, broad shoulders and drew attention to his necklessness. Around where his neck would be he tied a delicate lacy scarf in a Euro-male fashion.   Some reactions from Abby  myself: - Is that Meat Loaf? - Is that David Gest? - He looks like Prince's strange-looking cousin. - He looks like Jennifer Tilly crossed with a walrus. - He looks like a lion. - He looks like a pig crossed with Michael Jackson. - Is he Maori? Who are the aboriginal peoples of Australia? - I've already gone out with the ugliest person ever, might as well ask  this  guy out.
