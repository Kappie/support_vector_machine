Sometimes I raise my voice to correct my older daughter if she is doing something wrong, but on the bad days it seems I yell just for the sake of yelling. It’s like an out of body experience where you look down at yourself in total disbelief. I always told myself I wouldn’t repeat what my mother did to me and thankfully I don’t yell like she did. I gain more tolerance and yell less as each day goes by.   Surprisingly, playing with my children comes naturally to me. I don’t feel uncomfortable tickling them or playing games with my older daughter. I am able to give my daughters lots of kisses and hugs. When my husband throws my two year old into the air and she squeals with delight, I exhale knowing she is happy. I don’t take any of this for granted because when I was little I had very few healthy interactions with my mom.  The first memory I have of my mom is when I was about three or four years old. These memories are fleeting glances of her walking by me in the living room. She seemed to be in complete denial of my existence. My Grandmother was my Mom for the first seven years of my life. She was the nurturing one. I slept in a crib in Grandma’s bedroom for the first few years instead of upstairs with my mom. Grandma was rather elderly for her age and sat in a big rocking chair all day singing old songs and reading books to me. She loved to sing and sometimes I would sit on the arm of her chair for hours looking out of our big picture window listening to her sing. Sometimes she would watch me color and tell me stories about my Grandpa who was the Chief of Police in the Village of North Syracuse before he died in 1963. I would look at his pictures and try to imagine what he was like.   I really looked up to my Grandma. I was interested in everything she did and everything she had to say. She volunteered her time to the District Assemblyman, who was a close friend of the family, by cutting articles out of the newspaper and gluing them into a scrapbook. I’m not sure exactly why she did this but all that matters was that he was extremely grateful for what she did and I admired her for that.   Another reason I admired her was because even though she was such a calm person by nature, she passionately defended me when my mom was arguing and being unreasonable. In fact the only time I ever heard her raise her voice was during arguments between her and my mother. For instance one time, when I was in first grade, Mom started a fight with Grandma because she didn’t want to take me to ballet class. I don’t remember the specifics but my mom had come home from work and started yelling out of nowhere. I was scared and started to run up the stairs. Half way up I turned around because my mom began shrieking. I saw her banging her head on the wall as hard as she could. My Grandma could only stand and watch in horror. Even at such a young age I thought she would collapse from head trauma but to my surprise nothing happened. This was the first clear memory I have of my mom losing it. From that moment on I was afraid and clung even closer to my Grandma.  Even though I was so young I had a lot of insight as to what kind of a person my mother was. She seemed obsessed with anything remotely sexual and in my very young eyes this perversion controlled who she was. She hadn’t dated anyone since my father left – four months before I was born. Over the years she had gained about sixty pounds. Her thirty-year-old face had already produced lines, which depicted a constant scowl. On the rare occasions when she did smile it seemed like her face was straining to keep its form.  We lived in a two-story house in Upstate New York. My Grandma stayed on the first floor because she couldn’t climb stairs anymore.  My mom lived on the second floor which consisted of two bedrooms; one of which she had converted into a living room. This was where she spent all of her time in the evenings, watching the movie channels on cable.   I was wary of my mom but it wasn’t like I never tried to spend time with her. On the contrary, I starved for her attention. Sometimes in the evenings I would go upstairs and sit with her in silence while she watched her movies. She always watched movies that had nudity in them and refused to change the channel when I sat with her. She would say, “All right, close your eyes, a dirty part is coming on.”  I would sit with my hand over my closed eyes and wait patiently for the scene to pass. One night instead of covering my eyes with my hands I covered them with the book I was reading. Out of nowhere I felt her hand slap across my face. “I told you not to watch this part, I saw you peeking!”  Frustrated, I got up and went downstairs to be with my Grandma. I didn’t cry, and I didn’t bring up what had just happened because I knew I did nothing wrong. I knew my mother wasn’t right so I tried to file that memory away with the other strange things my mom used to do. Soon after my mom came downstairs and told my Grandma about what had taken place. When I walked into the room my mom was pretending she had a book in front of her face and was lowering it so she could blatantly peek over. I was outraged. What was going on?  I lost track of how many times she made me cover her eyes while watching one of her “dirty movies” on HBO. In her perverted mind she thought I wanted to watch these scenes while all I wanted was for her to turn the station to something else so we could spend quality time together. I looked at my Grandma and yelled, “I did not!”  I had never raised my voice at her before but I desperately needed to get my point across. I stood there looking into her eyes wondering if she believed me or not. I needed her to believe me because she was the one who loved me. I didn’t want her to hate me like my mom did. I never did find out if she believed me.   For the first time since I was born my Grandma decided to take a vacation. She and my Aunt decided to go down to Myrtle Beach for an entire week. This was the first time I was alone with my mom. The vacation came a year after the ballet class argument and I had no idea what to expect. Luckily I was able to go to school during the day so the week past by quickly. When my mom returned home from work every night I remember a lot of random yelling but I have no memories of being with her except for when she got me dressed for school. She scared me and I stayed away from her as much as possible.   One day that week I had a day off from school and reluctantly my mother decided to leave me at home. While watching her put on her daily dose of green eyeshadow she turned to me and said, “Now don’t go inside the bathroom closet while I’m gone. Your Uncle left some dirty books in there and I don’t know what I would do if your Grandma found out about them.”  I said okay and left. I couldn’t believe what I had just heard. Why would any mother tell a six year old something of that nature?  Besides I had been in that closet many times since my Uncle moved out. The only things in there was an old 1950’s floor waxer and some other items that belonged to my Grandma, so I was pretty sure she was lying about whose books they were.  As soon as she left the house I went straight to the closet. I was intrigued. How could someone put a “dirty” movie into a book?  After some digging I found the secret stash of books. There were about ten all together. Almost all of them had some sort of picture on the cover. One had a woman sitting up on the bed naked with a dog licking her crotch. Another had a dog sniffing a girl’s panties. Yet another showed a gay male couple having sex. I nervously put everything back the way it was and closed the closet door. I knew my Uncle had a way with the ladies, so to speak, so when I saw the men on the cover of that book I knew they couldn’t possibly be his. I felt disgusted and I had an uneasy feeling in my stomach because I sensed my mom had maliciously led me in there. I had no idea how graphic they would be. She must have known I would have gone into the closet after she left. I was a curious little girl and got into everything anyway. Why would she want me to see such a thing?  I was scared and I couldn’t wait for my Grandma to return.  When my Grandma returned home I sensed that something was different. I couldn’t put my finger on it but as she walked into the house time stopped. I was dancing around the dining room when light came in from the doorway and blinded me. When I spun back around I started to notice how different everything looked. The lighting was different, the mood was different and small items seemed out of place. I felt like a stranger in my own home.   One night, about a week after my Grandma’s return, my mom and I awoke to the sounds of moaning coming from my Grandma’s bedroom. I went back to sleep while my mom rushed down to see what was going on. As it turned out, she had been having small heart attacks for weeks and had refused to see a doctor. The next thing I remember was hearing the wail of an ambulance coming down the road.    Our road was a dead end with only fourteen houses.  We were like one big extended family. My Grandma and our neighbors were the original inhabitants of their houses and almost all of them were in their sixties and older. Whenever an ambulance came to one of these houses the person who was taken away never returned, however, while I stood at the top of the stairway I was oblivious to this fact.  I was in a daze and couldn’t comprehend what was going on.   When I went downstairs I saw paramedics everywhere. My Great Aunt and Uncle were also there to take me to their house before I got to see my Grandma leave and say goodbye. I was in shock. I had no real idea what was going on. All I knew is that I wanted to go back home. My Aunt and Uncle were in their late 60’s and my Aunt seemed cold and unloving. I guess she just couldn’t show her feelings well.   A day or two later one of my cousins brought mom home from the hospital. When the car pulled up I thought, “Maybe my Grandma is home!”  As I ran outside I noticed my mom walking up to the house crying. She bent down and told me my Grandma had died. I started crying in disbelief. She couldn’t be gone because she was the only one I had. She seemed so vibrant when she returned from her vacation. My mom hugged me and told me that her last words were to tell me she loved me very much. She was gone. She was only 62.   My family held an open-casket ceremony and I was torn between going up to the casket or staying in my seat. I finally made the decision to go up. I remember looking into the casket and being immensely grateful that she looked exactly the way she always had. I knelt down and said The Lord’s Prayer half-heartedly to myself. I bent over and kissed her on the cheek. I’m pretty sure my mom was standing there and told me to do so. I was scared. I remember how soft her cheeks were – just like they had always been. I stood there and took in the moment. It finally came to me. This would be the last time I would ever see her.  The first few weeks after my Grandma died were a whirlwind. My mom was worrying about carrying out her will and I was in the last few weeks of the second grade. When my Grandma was alive she essentially ran the household. She took my mom’s paycheck and paid my mother’s bills each payday. She also paid for the mortgage with her own money each month. Now my mom had to learn how to budget her own money, take on a new mortgage and pay attention to a child she never spent time with before. Things really started to tense up but luckily members of our family came around to help us with our grief and to help out around the house.  Eventually we stopped receiving as many visitors. My mom had two brothers who occasionally stopped by. The older one was my Uncle Don. He was the one and only father figure in my life. He was a loving and funny man who was well respected and loved throughout our community. Her younger brother was sort of the black sheep of the family. Someone once told me that he was in and out of juvenile hall as a child and now that he was older he ran from woman to woman, job to job and state to state. Don’t get me wrong I enjoyed his visits. He was a typical truck driver. Crude, sometimes, but pretty funny and I think he genuinely cared for me. I just couldn’t trust him because he had an overtly shady side that I couldn’t get past. He and my Mom used to fight like cats and dogs. During one of those fights she even blamed him for my Grandma’s death. She said that Grandma was always worried about him getting into trouble and he was the one who caused her fatal heart attack. My Uncle left the house that day vowing that he would never speak to her again, and rightfully so. I saw him from time to time at family gatherings. My mom certainly had a way with driving family and friends away from her.
