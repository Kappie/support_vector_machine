Guernica is one of his favorite Picasso's, in fact he even had a poster of it on his barracks room wall back in Fort Lewis. I guess CBFTW had to leave the poster back in Fort Lewis, otherwise he'd probably have to  urlLink conceal it,  that's if he wasn't court marshaled first for blogging William Sherman;   "I am sick and tired of war. It's glory is all moonshine. It is only those who have neither fired a shot nor heard the shrieks and groans of the wounded who cry aloud for blood, for vengeance, for desolation. War is hell." -William Tecumseh Sherman   I'm amazed he hasn't lost web access yet. His site has the most comprehensive disclaimer i've ever seen. Seeing is believing, as they say. (Pffft, would you believe it, the moment I typed "lost web access yet" my line actually dropped out. I'll be posting this later).  And one in Arabic;  urlLink Iraq Forever  by Fadhil. Noticed this blog a wee while ago but for some reason haven't linked it yet (perhaps i wondered about authenticity, although that hasn't stopped me from linking before.) Anyway, Zeyad gives his  urlLink opinion here.  Fadhil also blogs  urlLink The Great Iraq  in English, which is a collection of links and articles complementary to Iraq Forever.
