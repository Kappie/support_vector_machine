I feel like I'm moving forward. Careerwise, I'm making some good contacts. Joining BDPA, a black professional org for techies. Going to take a web content class and start getting some practical experience by volunteering. I'm going to hold off on seeing a career counselor just yet. My current job is still just...okay. I'm bored most of the time, but I've got a plan on how to make the most of my remaining time there. So that's good.  Socially, things are picking up again. I've joined some new groups and I have lots of fun things planned. I believe a lot of March is already booked up! I'm more excited about the sorority and I'm beginning to get involved more there.   Mentally, I'm planning to start seeing a psychologist to help me work on some of my issues. My insurance totally pays for it---so why not? Surprisingly, a lot of young women see one. I need to move toward wholeness. I need to work out my issues from the past and work on my weight. Taking care of those two things are what's really going to improve my overall self esteem...and generally my quality of life.  Romantically...well, there's still Derreck. We've seen each other about three times over the past month, which is a lot for us. He was in LA for Vday. He could have called...but didn't. Which is how I know we are FAR from there. But he actually called me up one Wednesday and asked me out on a date for that Friday....sort of! I stayed over and he left me in his house while he went to work the next morning!!! I thought that said a lot. You just don't leave any ole body up in your house. But we are far from getting anywhere. He has a lot of issues that he needs to work on. And so do I. He's not ready and I just have to accept that. I really would like to be dating someone else where it just feels easier to call them up and say let's check out a movie. Let's go hear some music. I could probably do that with Derreck. We just need to have a talk. And we haven't had a chance to do that yet. So right now, I just need to continue working on me.  Well, that's all for now. The cup is definitely half full right now and I feel excited about the possibilities.
