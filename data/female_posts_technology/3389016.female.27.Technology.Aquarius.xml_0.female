(And the sheep call him Bhaaaby!, it is still funny.)When I woke up it was 8:30am (I got a whopping 4hrs of sleep) and I had to be in a meeting at 9am. I was lucky to wake up. I got ready and went to the conference room and I felt very tired. During the meeting JP shows up apparently he and Bruce and Robert (Bobby) were out till about 8am they went to three sisters and then got lost on the way back since there was such thick fog. Did I say these guys could party? I watch JP do training after the meeting from 9-12:30. Man what a trooper. He is really good and funny too. I drink a lot of coffee and orange juice. urlLink
