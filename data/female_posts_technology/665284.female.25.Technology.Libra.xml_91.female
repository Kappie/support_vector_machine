I listened to it inside the fx on the way to the office.  He said that he does not remember doing business with LTA regarding a property in '98?  I am not sure since the radio transmission is jumpy.  Matagal na daw yun at hindi nya maalala.  They mentioned Mission St. and I remembered na dating address nyo yun.  They talked about visits by Rosebud and Victor Corpuz and the help that Mike Arroyo provided for them.  The people there were also discussing if they have the authority to subpoena the bank accounts of Arroyo and Pidal.  Someone asked about the Tuazon and Arroyo family, it's members, whether there's a will left etc.  It just seemed nice to hear the news on the radio this morning while it's raining outside.  The rain was hard enough that for about three hours, we could not go out of the house because of the flood
