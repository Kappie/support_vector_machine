I think Jesus is supposed to be the Light that came into the world, and represents goodness.  But people, having human nature and the inclination to sin, love darkness (sin) instead.  People like the sinful things they do, usually because it brings them some kind of physical pleasure or comfort, or lets them be selfish with their needs and wants.  But if you live this way and love your sins, you are rejecting God and Jesus and you'll never "come into the light" (the realization of the truth?) because then you'd have to face up to your sins and change how you live your life.  If you live your life by God's word, knowing the truth, you'll come into the light (be plain and obvious to everyone?) and it will be clear to others that the things you do are because of God.  I think this is how Bobby is and has been.  He's lived his life as a Christian, and because of that he shines in a way that very few people I've ever known have.  You can see there's something special in him, and when you ask him about it, he tells you -- it's because of God.  I think that's an example of what living your life by and through God will do.  It is so plain and obvious, and he's been such a good example of Christianity.  No, he's not perfect, no one is, and I don't expect him to be.  The point is that he tries to be, and you can see him from the inside out.  It's so plain and so clear that there's something special going on inside of him.  That's the kind of example I want to be.  Maybe someday I'll get there.
