I think it was masterfully written and if I wasn’t already so strongly decided on this issue, I most likely would have tilted towards Cousin’s viewpoint. I am 100 percent against assisted suicide. I believe it is completely and totally not up to us to decide when our lives should be over. I think it is up to God, who has an infinitely vaster and greater perspective on what is going on in this nutty world. *Blushes and steps off her soapbox.*  I can recognize how people would disagree with me and this essay certainly points them out. Mentioning a prominent couple who chose to murder themselves, the author brought us to the reality that it’s an issue we all have to face.  Again, had I not been clearly decided on suicide, I might have been swayed by the author’s persuasive and almost inescapable examples. I cannot and will not agree with him though.
