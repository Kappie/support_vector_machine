I wonder if I should change my mind, seeing these two stories.  This  urlLink one  talks about woman who had colon surgery in Sydney and they left the scissors in!  It almost reads like an urban legend or a hoax, but at least they went through the trouble of doctoring up x-ray photos if that's the case.  Things like this are the reason I'm nervous about my wisdom tooth extraction next week.  Four teeth, all impacted = lots of room for error.    Australian leaders could also be in trouble, according to this Reuters  urlLink story .  It appears that the Prime Minister has a kangaroo bone pointed at him by an Aboriginal woman, a curse that could be as severe as death.  Imagine having to give a serious answer to the press about that one.  "Well, yes, I am very concerned about this bone pointing matter and will be sure to negotiate with these folks right away.  Just kidding - had you fooled!"  The user  urlLink comments  on the Yahoo site about pointing the bone are more hilarious than the story itself.
