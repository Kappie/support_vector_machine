       I've just got to let you know 'Cause I wonder where you are and I wonder what you do Are you somewhere feeling lonely or is someone loving you? Tell me how to win your heart for I haven't got a clue...  ~ Lionel Richie in "Hello"  it rained last night.. woke up today morning and even before i stretched myself, thought of him.. coz he loves this heavenly earthy smell that pervades the air when it rains after long too.. its 3 in the afternoon now, the weather is as nice and as mushy as it was in the morning.. and i know i will moon about him the rest of the day too..   isnt it funny how we (i?!) sometimes emotionally attach ourselves to a person who doesnt care about us.. at least, not in the way that we would like him/her to?? you keep thinking about him, wondering what he would be doing at this instant, if he is out with friends, if he is playing his favorite game, if he is online chatting up friends, if he is playing one of his numerous pranks and "booting" people out of yahoo,if he is out on a long drive like he likes to do so much, if he is also in office..trying to work, but ending up staring out the window.. and if (dare i hope this?) .. if he has ever thought about me once in all this while.. if he ever thought about how i may be doing.. what i may be doing at that same instant.. wishful thinking, i suppose..   why do i remember each word he said, each gesture of his, the way he smiled or ran his hand through his hair, each prank he played, each funny mail he sent, each time i was one-up on him (few and far between, anyways) in a verbal match of wits online or otherwise, the feel of his skin when we shook hands, the intoxicating mix of the scent of his aftershave and him whenever i used to sit next to him, his likes and dislikes, his favorite color, his favorite song, his home address, his car color, his brother's name, his first project, his yahoo nicks, his school, his class, his section, his first crush.. oh someone take me to the nearest loony-house please!  feel like calling him up.. listening to his voice.. it has been a month-and-a-half since i did.. i know he wont be keeping a count like i do.. i know he wont be thinking about me every day like i do.. i try to convince myself to "move on".. not that i would be leaving much behind.. sometimes i succeed in shutting him off.. heck, he didnt _EVER_ care about me, what am i doing wasting my life and my emotions on someone who has made it abundantly clear that all he wants to do is sleep with me, and "thats got nothing to do who i am, just a simple function of the fact that he is a guy, and im not.'  come to think of it.. why am i even wasting precious blog space on him??!! umm i know why.. now that i have "bared my soul" here, i will probably go back to being happy again..  ah yes, i have started suffering from this peculiar fear of stairs since the past couple of weeks.. not heights, stairs! like while going down the stairs, i fear that i will trip or skip a step and go tumbling down all the way.. sometimes it takes me as many as 5 whole minutes to go down the three flights of stairs.. and this when i think that i have mastered the art of clutching the support railing tightly by one hand, balancing my purse/book/cell in the other, and taking one step at the time all through my way down.. i guess the saving grace is that noone has been around to actually see me negotiating my way down those stairs like i had tied my shoelaces up the wrong way! 
     
      wrong!!.. i didnt put up a new post for so long NOT coz i have been thinkin of a suitable title... well i have been.. but the absence of one wasnt reason enough.. and i figured noones gonna mind.. and anyways.. life hasnt been even remotely interesting these past few days.. not that its goin places now..    yeah right.. well, i _STILL_ entertain those thoughts of immortalising myself online!  have been wondering for the past few days what is it i actually want out of my life.. and where is it headed.. the scary bit is that i havent been able to come up with an answer to either!.. i havent been doing that great at work.. and then im not too bothered about it anyhow.. all i want is a good raise and a comfy life.. no longer do i want to "achieve" something.. nah, not something very grand.. but something as simple as goin on to the next level and leading a team (as opposed to mere coding, which i do now).. dont know when and how i stopped having those ambitions of doing whatever it takes to reach the top.. guess they died somewhere along the way, with a little bit of me.. and as to where my life is goin otherwise.. thats even more of a mess.. so how does a day in my life go?? wake up,go to work,pretend to look busy and harried throughout the day(not that difficult anyways), bitch bigtime in the usual crib sessions in the cafe over lunch or coffee.. about the sorry state of the project, my bank account, the peanuts i get as salary.. fancily called pay cheque, the brain-deadening shitloads of work (or even the lack of it!).. blah.. blah.. blah.. (yep, i do get carried away sometimes!).. anyways, so crib, crib and then crib some more.. come back home, read/chat/talk on the phone.. go to sleep.. repeat while true..  definitely not thriller material.. more like my maths textbook at school.. monotonous and difficult-to-get-through.. cant do much about it either.. yeah right i know its my life and all that, and its up to me to "make it better".. would have been easier had i known what i want out of it in the first place..  talked over the phone with this friend of mine whos back in India after looooong.. he is doing fantastically well in his job.. playing a PM's role.. leading a team.. client interaction.. facilitating workshops and what not.. felt so good for him.. but _DID NOT_ feel even a twinge of envy.. at not being in the same happy position myself.. considering that we started out together.. this lack of jealousy scared me to shit.. only for some time though.. i was back at my comfortably-numb-and-dont-care-anymore state of mind again after a while.. which is a cause for concern and bigtime too..  another friend read this blog and now "claims to know me much better than he did before".. the sweetheart that he is.. sent me "mini-blogs" as comments on mail, but didnt want to "make his presence felt" online.. wanted to know if he had "crossed the line" somewhere in his comments.. i decided to make him sweat by answering in the affirmative.. :P.. but decided not to at the last minute.. dunno why.. :)  and hey pramila.. (btw, folks, this is the  urlLink lady  whose writings are as addictive and as chocolates/your daily cuppa tea/coffee /grass/booze/all good things in this world .. once hooked, you just cant get enough of your daily fix.. shit.. i bungled it again! im not even goin to _TRY_ to say anything more about it .. time to click the link and get to see what my indequate words couldnt capture!) .. umm..what i was i sayin.. yeah.. i got my money back!!! YAY!!!!!! :)   btw, this colleague of mine wants to marry me.. umm, no not just out of the blue.. he has been saying it for like many months now.. but today he seemed like real hell-bent on getting an answer.. why havent i given one already? well, i hem and haw and ask him not to pursue the topic further.. but he doesnt desist.. he is a good friend.. an eligible bachelor in many respects, i suppose.. but i dont see him as someone i would want to spend my life with.. and i dont want to lose him as a friend.. hope he gets someone special soon.. the reason why i mentioned him today and not in earlier posts was.. we were chatting today evening... i asked him why he wants to marry me..and he goes like.. see, i like you.. so i ask whether there arent other females you like.. and he says well, there are others too, but some dont like me, some are taller, some are fatter etc etc.. so there.. :).. well, i suppose he is being honest about it all.. but doesnt do too much for my ego,does it? :)    "Guys are like stars, so many to choose from, but only one who can make all your dreams come true..."    
     
      no no noooo... this isnt a stinker about men, nor is this about singing paeans in their praise (hell, they dont deserve it anyways!) .. just an attempt to transfer the clutter in my mind here in the hope that it may help me figure what do i do or more pertinently, NOT do with these strange, presumptous species from Mars.. (phew!, i didnt know coming up with a title at last is gonna lead to so much explaining! :P)  two men.. i have known both for more than two years now.. one is an ex-colleague who doesnt tell who he is, only that he is "a long-time admirer" and that he "loves" me!.. yeah, i also screamed "psycho!!" the first i heard of it, but he is a determined loony for sure, hasnt strayed from this "i-honestly-cant-think-of-a-suitable-adjective-here" sales pitch in more than a year, and my curiosity to know who he really is, keeps me from ignoring him.. (though i would be less that honest if i say that i dont have a sneaking suspicion already, moi not _THAT_ dumb, you see! :P)  .. the second guy is also an ex-colleague (from a different organization).. and i was really.. and i mean _REALLY_ surprised to hear him talking like this.. he is definitely no saint.. and we have had 'such kinda' talks earlier.. but well, i think he crossed the line this time.. and i somehow didnt expect and like what happened..   enough background, eh? ;).. moving right along.. well, happened to chat with each of them over the weekend.. separately.. though you wouldnt guess it from the chat transcript snippets that follow..   Dude#1 : hi sweetie Dude#1 : how r u? Dude#1 : remember me? Moi : yes i do Moi : im ok Moi : hows u? Dude#1 : thank god Dude#1 : i am fine Dude#1 : how is ur work going? Moi : :)) Moi : work is shitty Moi : as usual Dude#1 : havent seen u here for long, what happened? Moi : ummm.. nothing.. just didnt log on for quite some time Dude#1 : yeah, yeah, work is shitty, but then he get paid for handling this shit, dont we? Moi : not enough buddy! Dude#1 : well, its been a long, how abut some erotic chat?:) Dude#1 : lol Moi : yeah.. i was wondering when you would come to that! Dude#1 : i didnt waste the time, u see Dude#1 : ready for it?:-P Dude#1 : a naked bathing scene Dude#1 : lol Moi : why are you so screwed up in your mind?  doesnt reply thereafter.. end of conversation.. the next one goes something like this..  Dude#2 : hi Moi : hey :) Moi : whatcha you doin at work on a weekend? Dude#2 : not at work.. Dude#2 : at home Dude#2 : what u doing ? Dude#2 : so whats new ? … … Dude#2 : will go and catch some.. sexy drew for now Dude#2 : 50 first dates Moi : :)) Moi : sure Moi : nice movie it is Dude#2 : ok Dude#2 : and she is nice too right ;) Dude#2 : u like her ? Moi : depends.. :P Dude#2 : hey com'n she has got a nice body for sure Moi : well, unlike you, im straight! :D Dude#2 : so u cant appreciate a sexy women Dude#2 : she is yummy :P Moi : well, i cant appreciate a sexy woman without any brains Dude#2 : one of the few hollywood women who has big assets ;) … … Dude#2 : she sure has a nice fig right Dude#2 : and big breasts too... hey com'n dont tell me.. girls dont notice Moi : mmm.. well.. go and see the movie :) Dude#2 : u evaded my question Moi : yes i did Moi : and for good reason Dude#2 : anyways Dude#2 : bye Moi : i dont like the direction this convo is taking Moi : bbye Dude#2 : :)) Dude#2 : so now..speaks up the brave girl Dude#2 : thats typical mentality.. nothing worng with u Dude#2 : bbye Moi : bye  to be fair to Dude # 2, i guess(and hope) he realized that something went wrong somewhere, and he buzzed me a while ago to say how he has been in a bad mood etc over the last couple of days.. and will talk to me when he is any better.. tentative apology?  dont know.. it didnt leave any scars i guess, apart from embarassment and me determined to be more prudish while online from now on.. come to think of it, it wasnt the poor guy's fault completely.. i should have kept my trap shut (and asked him to do the same) at a couple of points earlier.. he probably didnt know when he crossed the line from 'harmless fun' to 'sensitive territory'.. nah.. he _SHOULD_ have.. even an asshole would know that!  umm.. no.. not trying to set the record for the longest post ever.. though one of these days.. i know im gonna beat it one of these days.. and without much sweat either.. :P !  oh btw, i owe an apology to David Baldacci.. i can no longer put down that book without being cussed at.. :">.. must have had an inkling for whats coming though.. coz i bought two other books by him the day before! :D    'why do my monday morning blues stretch till friday evening?'  
     
      so why am i feeling a little outta sorts today? i have had almost the perfect day possible.. spent a bomb on clothes and other stuff i didnt need.. pigged out at my fave Chinese joint (prolly put on a few pounds in as many minutes).. met up with a very good friend of mine and his wife.. that too, after a long long time.. so why do i _STILL_ want to crib,crib and crib my way to glory (besides the old-habits-die-hard thingie) ??? read on.. (yeah.. insolence is way up there when i ask ppl what do they find so adorable about me!)  i think im angry at myself for letting me be taken for a fool.. and not just once or twice either.. there is this friend/neighbor of mine who keeps "borrowing" money from me now and then.. and then conveniently "forgets" to return it.. to think that i paid up for her entire shopping spree today.. (actually it serves me right for flaunting my new card, when i should have kept my purse and trap shut) ..even while _KNOWING_ all the time that she doesn't have any intentions for paying up.. (im a firm believer in precedents, you know).. it may sound holier-than-thou, but i dont mind the money as much as the sickening feeling of being taken for granted.. dont get me wrong.. im as miserly and as tight-fisted as one can be.. but what gets my goat is.. that i _KNOW_ ive been a fool.. and i _CANNOT_ do a single thing about it.. the fact that she is a good friend and basically a nice soul in all other respects may also have something to do with my forced lack of reaction to this crap im being handed out on a plate..  a new paragraph.. and i can just about hear your audible sigh of relief.. o hapless reader.. at your suddenly-revived hopes of this blog going back to being "happy".. but alas! by and by you will get to know that my propensity of wallowing in self-pity never ceases to amaze everyone but myself..it doesnt help that im ashamed at myself.. ashamed for feeling jealous of this friend i talked about earlier, and his wife.. and their togetherness.. the way they were enjoying each other's company so much.. those naughty and sometimes risque inside jokes that all newly-married couples seem to enjoy.. theirs was a love marriage btw.. straight-outta-movies (oh okay.. straight-outta-Bollywood-movies) stuff.. families who were friends/neighbors-turned-foes.. intense opposition to even mingling around with ppl "on the other side of the fence".. let alone marriage.. and despite it all, a fairy-tale turn of events and conjugal bliss thereafter.. (Amen!)  And here i was, meeting them for the first time after their marriage.. and feeling myself _ACTUALLY_ turning green with envy... :(   why?? WHYYYY?? WHYYYYYY , you ask?????  coz i want to hold hands with someone too and walk into the sunset.. (yes, im hopelessly and grossly over-the-hill when it comes to mush)  i want him to lean over and whisper in my ear how much he loves me..  i want to hug him back and tell him i always knew that..  i want him to hold me tightly and kiss me like he will never let me go..  more than anything, i want him to look me in the eye and say..  WHAT THE FUCK??? "There was never an us and there never will be, and im really sorry about that, but _NOTHING_ is ever going to change that, so it would be best for you to move on and find someone who cares for you as much as you care for him."  WHAT THE FUCK!!!   
     
      yeah right.. i didn't expect to come back so soon myself.. :"> ..many reasons for me blogging merrily away at this unearthly hour.. i guess i dont have anything else to do on this wonderful Friday night.. except perhaps dream of the good times beckoning in the two days ahead.. i can afford to sleep till noon tomorrow.. no work and all play.. YAY!! :) (now you (whoever you may be :P) know what i meant by freaking out :P) ..   but i just _HAD_ to come back to link this _FANTABULOUS_ blog of an equally amazing lady from mine.. :).. check out the indequately titled first link on the wannabe sidebar on the right.. (and to think they told me that all "user-friendly" sites should either have the main nav bar on the left or the top! MORONS! :P) .. oh,but i digress.. i just dont have words to describe how beautifully well this lady writes.. and with such ease and apparent lack of effort.. i couldn't even _DREAM_ to pen(oh okay TYPE!) my thoughts on-the-fly so that they make such interesting reading that one cant just get enough of them.. nah.. scratch that.. that doesn't even _BEGIN_ to describe her way with words.. back to square one.. duh.. didn't i say before?? best thing to do.. hop across and get bowled over yourself.. :)  ummm.. what else.. am waiting for this friend of mine to come online.. he promised me he would.. at a given time.. but the asshole that he is.. HE HASNT :(( !! you know what, you will PAY for this! (devilish grin!)  guess i should go back to reading the "new" book by david baldacci.. have to admit it isn't as compulsive a page-turner than his earlier two books i read.. the name of the offending book is "the simple truth".. and it _IS_ a bit of a letdown coz i havent been able to bring myself to finish more than 20 pages in two complete days!! good lord!!! i guess its all the legal stuff more than anything else that put me off..  which reminds me.. the previous book i read was a tad.. no rather.. much better.. "memoirs of a geisha"... about the unusual species of "women entertainers" in pre-and-post-world-war-II japan.. their quaint little ways and traditions.. like it was really strange to know that it was a practice to bid for a geisha's "mizuage".. basically to get to sleep with the girl for the first time in exchange for money/gifts!! GAWD!!  no i didnt mean this post to sound(look,feel,taste,smell?? :D) like a tedious book review.. :">.. but things hardly, if ever, turn out to be the way i want them to.. :)  ummm.. after the wannabe intellectual review thingie, i guess its only befitting that i end this post with the thought of the day/night/whatever.. WHY DO I END UP WAITING FOR/HOOKING UP WITH ALL THE WRONG GUYS??!! :(( . yep, thats more of a crib than anything else.. but hey, i guess all newbies suffer from the WTHIMBIT??!! syndrome.. (what-the-hell-its-my-blog-isnt-it??!!) .. yeah i guess i forgot to mention my horrible.. or rather non-existent sense of punctuation and capitals! (more horrors yet to come!) :P  and hey thanks everyone who has been nice enough to visit my blog and/or comment on it :) .. a whole new woorrlllddd :D!  
     
      :).. i guess its only appropriate that my first attempt at this sort of thing (or shall i be pompous, and say chronicling my stay and my misadventures on this planet :D) should start with a smiley.. coz i hope it will be a happy blog.. amen! :)  so, why am i here? hey, i DONT KNOW.. prolly its a vain attempt at immortalizing my mundane day-to-day experiences.. prolly its out of sheer boredom (and the desire to equally bore some unfortunate others :D).. but i guess most of all, this is MY SPACE.. i can afford to just write whatever i want, whatever i feel like, without caring for typos, atrocious spelling or grammar.. and i can just go on and on.. wasn't the title clue enough? :p  i guess the first post is meant as a forerunner of things to come.. as i had intended it to be  .. but now that im here, i can't really think of what to write (blog fright?? ;) ).. except that the weekend is here and i intend to _FREAK OUT_! :)  Until the next time then..  :)  ciao  
     
      im worried about  urlLink pramila  .. her mom is in the hospital and she is all alone with her.. and understandably in a blue funk.. poor soul.. :(.. and it seems no friends are forthcoming in this hour of need.. :( .. i hope her mum gets well real soon..  the only 'interesting' (depending on which way you look at it) incident that happened today was.. i had only one ear-ring on at work today for a couple of hours.. :).. no.. not like its some new-fangled fashion trend or something.. just that i didnt realise when the nice lil contraption at the end of it fell off.. leaving behind just the hook (or whatever its called).. and oblivious to this, i was merrily roaming around.. thankfully, caught sight of myself in the mirror inside the.. ahem.. loo.. and it took me a moment to realise that my face is looking rather lopsided.. :).. nobody else thankfully seemed to notice.. or if they did, they were too polite to give me weird sideways glances or even raised eyebrows.. i had NO CLUE i had lost the earring until i happened to glance at myself (mmm make that when i was strutting around in front of the mirror :) ).. all said and done, no harm done to my reputation of.. being perfectly turned out always?? nooo.. of being a sensible sorts, not trying out weird things just for the heck of it.. speaking of which, there are so many masterpieces in my office i can blog on and on about.. some other day.. :)  someone at work asked me 'what was the secret behind my ever-increasing beauty?'.. sic.. did he really think i would believe such an unbelievably untrue remark, and think the better of him for it?? the corny nature of the compliment (what im assuming here is that the poor sod wanted to tell me that i was looking good) put me off.. did he pick it up from  urlLink here ?  and this rather corny remark was all the more surprising coming from whom it did.. coz this guy is toooo gooood at flirting.. he is suave, confident, articulate, and makes a woman feel really special when talking to him.. he is attentive, and looks at you straight in the eye while talking, with such an expression as at that moment there is noone else in the world whos more interesting than you.. he makes you feel wanted and desirable.. and he is ever ready with a witty repartee.. and he is fun to talk to.. in some ways, he reminds me of him... and prolly that is why i find myself buzzing him whenever im bored.. why do i do this when i know that whatever he says is shallow?? and why do i get inordinately pleased when he flatters me?? why do i WANT to believe all the outrageous things he says sometimes??.. i dont know..  doesnt my going on and on about a couple of stupid things (and calling one of them the only interesting happening in my life recently) tell ya tons about the state of my life???  he just got online.. and hey, as im writing this, he got offline.. now the sucker that im, i will keep wondering for the next couple of hours why he did that.. was it because 'she' wasnt online? .. had they set up a date online in advance? do 'they' normally do that?? had i not been invisible, would he have stayed online , prolly waiting for me to buzz him? (infinitely crazy, you say?? i agree).. has he had his dinner?? what time will he go to sleep??.. how are things at work with him?? hows he doing otherwise?? has he grown back that french beard??.. does he think of me now and then?? shall or shant i mail him on his bday??..   whatever...  
     
         i have started jotting down an account of my day-to-day expenses.. in the hope that it would prevent me from spending obscene amounts of money (obscene to me, that is, considering that my paycheque has hit a plateau for the last year or so; it may be a perfectly reasonable amount to almost everyone else) on things that i could do without.. but i cant seem to stop the outflow of cash.. i just CANT stop myself from buying something if i like it.. be it a book, a dress, an accessory.. doesnt matter if i actually/immediately need it or not.. but the sight of something desirable on the shelf is too tempting to resist.. i guess its got something to do with being insecure.. acquire a good thing even if i dont need it.. so that someone else doesnt pick it up for themselves?? so my attempt at being thrifty doesnt meet its mission.. the only thing it accomplishes is make me even more helpless and guilty about the cash i end up spending..   ma and pa are looking for a match for me, and each guy and family who we think is 'good enough' and try to initiate talks with (god, i make it sound like a business!) first wants to know an approximate figure which pa can 'invest' (i was right, it really is a business).. god, they dont even care how i look, how i talk, whether im compatible enough, these things are relegated to the background.. apparently unimportant enough to be talked over AFTER the most crucial thing has been decided upon.. it makes me want to throw up at times.. and at others, i feel so damn depressed at wondering if at this rate, i would ever be able to settle down (desperate? no.. more like, disillusioned).. i lose all respect for the guy and his family the moment they utter the D word.. and i cant bring myself to like and care for a guy who wants his marriage to provide for his financial backbone.. then why the hell are you earning in the first place, asshole?? why don't you instead put on your best dandy clothes and strut around and try to make out with a girl whos father is stinking rich??!!!!! .. is money all marriage is to you???? what if i bring a shitload of money and then dont respect your parents, pick fights with your family, and give everyone a hard time in general?? must be, coz you dont even bother to meet the girl if the 'estimate' doesnt match your bloated hopes.. sic..  tried getting tickets for 'Yuva' yesterday.. but seems it was the most awaited movie for Delhiites and Gurgaon-ites.. every damn show was running houseful.. :( .. will try my luck again next weekend..   have gotten into this habit of bullet-pointing even my informal mails.. trying to fit in to the PM's shoes? prolly.. since they seem to be the most vela species around.. ;)   breaking news : i just went and pigged out at Tandoori Express at the M mall.. and this when i couldn't differentiate whether the gravy had oil or vice versa ..my trousers already seem tighter at the waist.. :((
     
      you cannot will someone to love you back.. unfortunately, the saying 'where theres a will, theres a way' doesnt hold true in this most important of situations.. why is it then that i cant seem to forget:  - his smile? - his voice? - his face? - each and every bit of small talk between us? - every mail he sent, verbatim, even though i deleted all of them just so that i wouldnt remember and try to find non-existent hidden meanings behind his words? - the few times we had lunch together? - the few times that we sat together at meetings, bumped into each other in the corridors? - the few times that his hand brushed against mine? - exactly how many days it has been since i last talked to him, saw him or met him? - what he was wearing the last time i saw him? - why do i remember his reaction(or the lack of it) to each new dress i wore to work? - why do i like his favorite colors? - why have i started liking his favorite band, his favorite songs, his favorite movies, everything that he likes? - why do i remember each time i caught him staring at me, and why do i want to read anything more than physical attraction in it? - why do i keep running his words over and over in my mind, until i manage to twist the meaning into what i like? - why do i want to forget our tiffs, and only want to remember the few-and-far-between good times? - why would i happily forget his drinking, sleeping with other women, as long as he promises to be loyal to me hereafter, when these are things i would hate in any other guy? - why do i over-glorify him sometimes in my mind? - why do i see everything about him with rose-tinted glasses? - why do i keep fantasizing about "us" over and over again, until i lull myself into a pleasant dreams of "happily ever after", only to find tears stinging my eyes when my brain starts functioning again and jolts me back to the 'real world'? - why do i want to believe that everything about him is perfect, when i know it isnt? - why do i hang on to the false hope that he hasnt forgotten me, that he still remembers me now and then? - why do i want to hear his voice? - why do i want to see him, talk to him, sit next to him and chat about anything under the sun? - why do i want to know everything about him, each small facet of his life, starting from his childhood, and thereafter? - why do i check his sun sign's horoscope every time i check mine? (Thanks Invictus) - why do i involutarily crane my neck to see if its he whos driving every time i see a car of the same make on the road? - why do i think that it may be his call, each time my phone rings and i cant figure out the number? - why do i want to use his bday as an excuse to call him up/mail him? - why did i wait for his call on my bday? - why do i wonder umpteen times a day what he might be doing at that particular instant in time? - why is he the first person i look for when i get online, even though i know i wont talk to him? - why can't i bear the thought of him even touching another woman? - why is he the first person with whom i want to share every little thing that happened with me each day? - why is he the first person who comes to mind when i want to share anything that matters to me? - why is he the first person i think about when i want a shoulder to cry on? - why do i instantly wonder why he isnt around when someone tells me im looking good? - why do i get irritated when someone tells me he likes/loves/cares about me.. oh, well i know the answer to this one, coz just as i know that there is no "us" however much i may like them as friends, and my feelings towards them wont ever change, i dont being on the receiving end when it comes to him and me? - why do i refuse to believe that he is going steady with someone, preferring rather to convince myself that he only said that to get rid of my unwanted attentions.. and why is that better than his being in love with someone else.. why does THAT hurt? why am i selfish enough to feel happy thinking that he hasnt found love yet? - why do i compare every guy i meet with him, and why the heck does he always end up winning? - why the hell can't i bring myself to feel that way about any other guy? - why is he still my first waking thought? - why do i always think about him as i drift off to sleep at night? - why do i keep hoping against hope? - why the hell do i still want to believe that he cares about me, when i KNOW he doesnt, and when he has done everything he could do to make me feel otherwise? - why do i know that its not just my ego thats hurting at his rejection, and its not only a matter of wanting something/someone you cant have all the more, but something else too i cant define? -why do i still hurt inside?
     
       urlLink YOUR  Song  It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside I'm not one of those, who can easily confide I don't have much money, but boy if I did I'd buy a trendy laptop for you, and hope it would make you glad.  If I was a sculptor, but then again no, Or someone who makes potions in a travelling show I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do My gift is my song and this one's for you.  And you can tell everybody, this is your song It may be quite simple but now that it's done, I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind That I put down in words How wonderful life is while you're in the world.  I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss Well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song, It's for people like you, that keep it turned on.  So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do You see I've forgotten, if they're green or they're blue Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen.  And you can tell everybody, this is your song It may be quite simple but now that it's done, I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind That I put down in words How wonderful life is while you're in the world.  I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind That I put down in words How wonderful life is while you're in the world.  (with apologies to Elton John for fiddling with the  urlLink original lyrics  here and there!)  this is for all those times when you make me feel like you are sitting inside my head, reading my thoughts merrily away, with your posts.. though i would be crazy to even think that i could express them so beautifully and touchingly.. 
     
      elections are such a strange phenomenon.. the entire country seems to be in the grip of netas,votes,exit polls and what not.. first the smug pundits predict whos gonna win, and then after the results are out, proving them all wrong, these same guys start falling all over themselves tryin to twist their original utterances beyond recognition.. without having the good grace of going red in the face at least _once_! we even had ma prem usha reading tarots on 'aaj tak' predicting that mr.vajpayee has all the good things in store for him and would definitely retain his office.. talk about raising false hopes!! bet she is busy eating her hat (er, sari pallu/dupatta/scarf) right now!!  talking abt mr.vajpayee, i would have thought our tv channels would accord him a more generous farewell than the current crop of obits they are churning out, more quickly than you can say 'vote for me'.. a couple of the channels ran clippings of how he came to an abrupt stop in the middle of a speech (not to be confused with one of his innumerable and irritating pauses), coz he forgot what he was about to say, and had to be prodded by the one of the aides standing by before he could continue! and a couple of other faux pas.. hell, the guy is over 80, i dont know whether i would even be able to stand up by myself when/if i manage to live those many years!! and why rake up all this now, i wonder how it feels like resigning from the PM's office.. suddenly you are a mere mortal all over again, and after what those exit polls said about nda holding on, and not a chance of the congress returning to power!!!! i mean i have had colleagues in the office doing mental somersaults after hearing that bjp has been mercilessly routed out.. and here we are talking about this guy whos in the center of the storm.. give him a break guys!  and somehow i dont like the idea of sonia gandhi getting to be our PM.. i mean the last time i saw her on the telly, she _still_ had trouble giving a speech in hindi without reading up from her notes! call it pop patriotism/jingoism or what, it just doesnt seem right when a 'citizen of foreign origin' (oh, alright, alright, i guess im just feelin a lil soft towards the bjp for being so unceremoniously chucked out, its another matter that i didnt vote myself!) gets to be the prime minister!! why cant we choose from the rest of the gang?? they will be as bad or as good as her, and besides, they would not speak hindi as a curious mix of italian and english! priyanka gandhi is cute though.. a colleague of mine just cant wait to see SG become the queen bee, coz it would mean that he would get to see and hear more of the cute priyanka !! :)  i also am kinda sad that smriti irani lost.. the lady has got spunk. she can take on more experienced players in the political arena, she is articulate, and speaks her mind.. of course all this doesnt mean that she would have proven worthy if she got elected.. but well, i STILL like her! :)  OMG.. i didnt intend to be all worked up about politics and politicians.. guess i can attribute it to my habit of going on and on once i start on a topic.. i can see it in the length of my sentences too.. wonder if i _ever_ will be able to get my point across succinctly, charmingly and without spending an aeon to do it too!  brevity is not something i have ever learnt.. i started off this post meaning to talk about 'main hoon na' and other stuff.. i guess the shift happened coz for the past week, election news has been practically pouring out of my ears, what with pa trying his best to watch all the news on each channel at the same time..   leavin the tales and implausibilities of 'main hoon na' and other assorted topics for a better day (night? evening?)...    
     
      nah.. not because the blog has a new (better and improved??) look.. nor because the new post will be a _RELATIVELY_ short one.. so?? why?? GENERALLY.. folks!!! :)  thought would write up a new post, but the new look took up all of my attention, time and sweat, and its past curfew time already.. so me thinks i will end here (i did promise a _RELATIVELY_ short post after all!) and go off to sleep.. (YAWNNN!)  as for the new look, bouquets as well as brickbats are welcome.. but please direct the brickbats to the new comments section offered by blogger.. coz i put it there just to experiment and will take it off sooner than later.. :P .. (oops, i wasnt supposed to tell you that, now, was i?? :D)  P.S. : Thanks Invictus, for figuring out what happened to the non-appearing comments link.. and making me feel like im still a techie.. inspite of all the goof-ups! :)
     
      this line of the famous dialogue in "When Harry Met Sally" made me think.. if it really is true.. if my male friends(who happen(ed) to achieve the crazy feat of finding me desirable at some point in life or other.. ah, vain moi!) aren't really friends.. and if they too have the one thing on their minds when we talk/meet up/chat.. and most unsettling of all, if I dont mind that, if i too want them to keep on thinking that way, to satisfy my ego/vanity whatever, even though im not romantically inclined towards any of them...  i still havent been able to figure this one out..  anyways.. downloaded the new yahoo messenger BETA version.. and is it COOOOL??? you bet it is!!!! the look is disconcertingly msn-ish.. but the features are AWESOME!! you can create a new avatar, kind of expressing yourself online through an image..(though they could have given the option of black hair, and they could have an additional XL version of the svelte pencil-thin lass on offer right now, and most definitely, more accessories and more hairdos to choose from :P ) .. (sometimes i wonder why i cant even praise something properly!!) so anyhow, create your very own avatar share it with friends while chatting.. then you can listen to online radio.. new emoticons.. new audibles.. the works! i reallllly like it!!  committed a faux pas AGAIN this friday.. i was out with friends for my bday treat.. now we have this unwritten rule that if the bill is more than a certain amount.. we pool in for the rest.. and well, the amount came out to be higher than it usually does.. so it was suggested that we go dutch.. and.. i refused.. i insisted on paying the entire amount by myself.. i dont know.. dont get me wrong.. im NOT rolling in moolah.. in fact, i have trouble remembering the last time i managed to save up some.. but i guess i didnt want anyone else to be paying for my bday treat.. but in the process i must have managed to look air-headed, too proud, arrogant and what-not to the others :(.. i could see that they were surprised.. and when they insisted to pay up their share.. i must have refused more forcefully than was called for.. im such a pighead! i dont even know how to tell them that i wasnt tryin to show-off or whatever.. God.. i dont think i could do that even if i wanted to.. for the very simple reason that i cant lay claim to ANYTHING i can show off!!! but all the same, it must have seemed weird.. another case of foot-in-the-mouth i suppose.. now i dont know what will happen the next time we go out and face a similiar situation!!  started taking driving lessons since the last week or so.. i havent still progressed beyond the basics of clutch, brakes and gear.. and i cant EVEN keep the damn car in a straight line.. somehow or the other it seems to go to the right or the left out of its own volition.. the hapless instructor has stopped even bothering to tell me to take corrective action when i goof up (coz thats almost always) and begin careening dangerously close to another vehicle on the road.. he just gets hold of the wheel himself and manevuers the car back where it can cause no damage to itself and the others, with an exasperated frown on his face.. :"> .. and its so infuriating to look at other drivers passing me by with a condescending glance, as they look at the logo of the driving school, and realise that im a novice at this.. and some of them even smirk if i am having trouble with the controls.. at such moments i feel like ramming the car straight into theirs.. and well i guess thats bound to happen one day or the other, if i keep paying more attention to what other ppl on the road are doing.. rather than worrying about myself.. :D.. but all said and done, its _SUCH_ a thrill to be in the driver's seat.. literally.. and i cant wait for the time when i would have the requisite skill and courage to zip around on the roads.. rather than crawl along on them.. add to that the comfort when it comes to being mobile on your own, rather than scrounge lifts from family/friends.. or be at the mercy of the fleecing autowallahs!! yep.. JUST CANT WAIT! :) 
     
      thought i would start my nu post with a witty, smart-ass line.. but cant think of any right now, in fact, have been tryin to think up one since the afternoon .. :"> .. so figured i would do the honors WITHOUT it.. :)  umm.. had an okay types weekend.. saturday was spent in shoppin and pigging out at various places.. yep, pigging out at various places too! no wonder i look the way i do.. ah yes, something unusual happened in my usually monotonous day-to-day existence.. i ACTUALLY started writing a story!! thanks pramila for goading me into doin that.. :).. though the end result wasn't anything to write about (yep, i 'expected' it to at least be _SOMEWHAT_ interesting.. have too big an ego not to.. ) but ended up churning out a pile of mush :).. big enough to bury big fat moi under it..   sunday was when i completed a quarter-century on this planet.. nope wasnt on Pluto before that.. just a hopefully-smart way of putting across the fact that i turned 25 that day.. :P.. so it felt _REALLY_ nice to get calls/mails/visits from friends/relatives/acquaintances.. there were a couple of surprises.. a bunch of neighborhood kids came over to wish me a happy birthday.. with an _IMPOSSIBLY CUTE_ card.. and i was like WOW! :).. touched beyond words and very, very pleasantly surprised... they promised to remember my bday the next year too.. double WOW! :).. then late at night, a friend of mine called up.. now we were together at school for a coupla years.. and he is like the _MOST ADORABLE PRANKSTER_ i have ever come across.. but i had lost touch with him since long.. and hence wasnt expecting his call or any surprises.. now this guy calls up and pretends to be the dad of a common friend of ours(umm, who kinda likes me and whom im still in touch with).. and this first guy can mimic just as well too.. so imagine my surprise when he calls up and asks about me, my parents, life in general.. i was amazed as anything.. since never before had his dad called me up ever (and why would he?).. it was only when he got to the part about how X(the guy who likes me) keeps on talking about me, and all good things too, did i smell a rat! and then i realised who it must be.. :).. but hey, it felt good to be on the receiving end of his sweeeeet pranks after a long long time.. :) made me feel ancient too, when i thought about the passage of time since i left school..   monday was goood and baaaad.. good coz when i came in to work, i found that all our systems have been attacked by some kinda virus and we couldnt even log in.. so the day(well, most of it anyways) was spent in the cafe.. (cribbing and pigging out, what else?) , readin this new epic i have started on .. 'the pillars of the earth' by ken follett.. (and btw, i have only good things to say about it, its REALLY nice .. and come to think of it, i can never ace the GRE.. i cant think of any adjectives beyond 'good' and 'nice' to describe a thing i like! ).. , taking long walks downstairs (did i mention that the weather has been nicer (shit, there i go again!) over the last couple of days), having the luxury of time on my hands and NOT knowing what to do with it.. the luxury of enjoying a looong lunch without worrying about going back to my desk to complete what i had left off before it.. the luxury of being able to just stare back at my comp.. the luxury of just roaming around the office without any purpose, chatting up other people just for the heck of it etc etc.. if you are wondering why dont i quit my job and do all these things otherwise, well, the obvious reason is i need the moolah.. and also the fact that i wouldnt know what else to do! anyhow.. so everywent fine until just around 5 when things started to fall back into place.. and then we had to go back to work again..    this brings me to today.. hasnt been any better either.. with work, work and only work all the way through.. doesnt help that i am supposed to be working on two different pieces of work at the same time.. people coming over to me from all over the place.. asking if i have done anything of note since the past few days.. it isnt a particularly happy feeling to admit that you havent.. both for me and them.. lunch (the only event i look forward to at office btw :D) was horrible too.. they served mushrooms.. and i had to summon every ounce of my will-power NOT to look at them.. well, i did look at them. (sheepish smile.. in fact, stare like hell would be more like it, smacking my lips when i remembered their heavenly taste.. ).. but they seemed to be made in oil rather than gravy.. and i closed my eyes and tried to remind myself how i had looked in a full-length mirror the last time i had the courage to do that.. and voila! i found that i could actually avert my eyes from the serving and look at the watery dal instead.. had dal and roti and MACARONI (YUMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!) for lunch.. now dont ask me what was i doing having macaroni.. hell, i cant pass up _TWO_ yummy delicacies at a time!!! btw, while i was shamelessly loading my plate with a HUGE helping of macaroni, i tried my best not to remember my mirror image.. :P  umm.. he didnt call up on my bday.. an absolutely irrational, optimistic, and crazy part of me had thought he would.. but i guess the thought WAS crazy after all!! heck, i am ashamed to admit how that single wish, a two-minute call/msg/buzz/whatever, had it happened, would have meant more to me than _ALL_ the other wishes combined..   its as Drew BarryMore said in 'Charlie's Angels' ...  "Its just my luck, I finally find the perfect guy, but he already has the perfect girl" .. but come to think of it, had he been perfect, he would have cared for me, no?? doesnt make me _WANT_ him (in all possible ways one can imagine) _ANY_ less though..
     
      So I took another  urlLink test  to find out what kind of a blogger I am, and apparently I am quite an avid one!  here's what the results say:   I took the  urlLink Blogging Personality Quiz  at  urlLink About Web logs  and I am...    The Daily Grinder    I love blogging because it's like therapy. I can write about anything and everything that happens to me - from the food I ate to what I was doing when I heard the latest 'breaking news'. Being able to communicate with my friends (online and/or real life) through my blog is important to me.    So shall I take a bow or did you just say, "honey, you needn't have gone to so much trouble to find that out. The title and the description say it all!"  There's this another, more comprehensive test, which claims to tell you your  urlLink bloginality  and a pretty decent claim it is too! The questions are about as many as the previous test, but it boasts of a much more detailed and in-depth analysis of the results. I feel that this test has got to do more about YOU than what's your blogging style though! I am an  urlLink ISFJ  btw!  oh, and  urlLink Denuone Latine loquebar? Me ineptum.

AND theres a  urlLink Hima  across the Atlantic too! i will be damned!!! okay peeps, the next time you run into me, you need to bow, twice (one for the name of each place named AFTER me, you silly geese!), curtsey, and address me as Her Royal Highness or else i will be "off with your head"!  and the next one is an offshoot i suppose:  #2 :  urlLink  Welcome to the Hima News !   : move over Mr. Prannoy Roy, the new order cometh! and get a load of this : "Hima is a tiny community near Manchester(Kentucky), in Clay County, US"! er, wow. and the "Hima" news has been in existence since 1954! i will be damned! i hadn't even been hatched then! er, i guess this means that they didnt name it such in my honor then after all? duh! ?(okay you riff-raff, you can get away with bowing once now!) check out the babe on the homepage though! ;)  #3 :  urlLink  Adventure Hima Trek of Nepal - VisitNepal.com - Trekking in Nepal    : A definite step down the ladder, but i am not complaining! i somehow like Nepal a LOT better now! me thinks i will forego my annual trip to Paris for trekking in Nepal next summer! ;)  #4 :  urlLink Hima's blog!!!    : one of the many jappu blogs around (hima seems to be quite popular a name there, though i dont know why, esp coz i have been told that it means "free time" in japanese!) all of the blogs are obviously and unfortunately(for me) in nihongo(japanese) though, and hence quite unfathomable for a poor bilingual like me! also, a first, finding someone who shares my name AND whos a male AND  urlLink who's a prof at Oxford!!!  its always nice to come across namesakes. :)  here are the critics' choices btw (i sooo wish mom and dad had had occasion to read these before christening me):  #1 :  urlLink  oh?!   #2 :  urlLink  well..   #3 :  urlLink  er...well.. uh.. this is gettin a bit too jiggy for me!   : so nice, its made of ice, eh?! :))  my bubble bursteth!!!  !!!  btw,  urlLink interesting read  for poor souls like me who have desi friends who insist on talking in the Queen's English Circa 2004.

      Thats how i would describe my adventures on the net last night. I guess "adventures" would be putting it a little too, well, adventurously i suppose. But I did last night what I haven't done for a long long time, too long in fact. Er, no I didn't watch porn or chatted up horny males/females. What other earth-shaking activity(no puns intended!) did i indulge in then?   well, i logged on for the express purpose of checking out other people's blogs. I have been doing it off and on lately, but last nite, it was the raison-d'etre of my online presence.  Started off with going through the profiles of bloggers on our very own Blogger, basically looking for anything or anyone interesting and funny 'out there', hopped across to  urlLink Blogarama , where searches for the most popular and most cool and mostly highly rated led only to sex blogs.   Disillusioned, took to google and searched for any blogs by  urlLink Sapient  (my previous organization) people, probably because i was feeling nostalgic, and because i hoped that i may run into some people I knew in what now seems to be another life.  after an hour and half of searching, i had found just one blog by a sapient india person (don't ask me why i was specifically looking for a fellow indian),  urlLink this one , though I came across quite a few blogs by some of the (erstwhile) sape expats, some whom i don't know, like  urlLink Ken , and some whom i did, people like  urlLink Angie  and  urlLink someone who has a knack of taking divine pics .  on the whole, made a nice change from just logging on to check mails, chat and surf aimlessly.

      and had i been wearing a hat, i would have had to eat it! i didnt have any great expectations from the movie, did not want to spend the time and money to go to a theatre to watch it and it was only the boredom of a humid Saturday afternoon that made me go and get the VCD, and boy, am I glad I did!  its yet another classy effort by Farhan Akhtar, with slick direction, a tight storyline, and decent music, and its beeeeeeeeeeautifully shot. I was rather skeptical when people associated with the movie used to say in their interviews that Kargil is only a backdrop to the story of a confused young guy in the movie, and I thought that this was going to be yet another "LOC", full of pop-patriotism, what with grown-up and supposedly-disciplined people foolishly jumping in front of a hail of army bullets to take impossible revenge on the enemy, because a close friend/mate of theirs has just been shot down in the previous scene!   what do films which show such scenes want to prove? agreed that the pain of losing a loved one is blinding and all-consuming, but do professionally trained and disciplined people really lose reason?? should i believe that our soldiers are immature enough to waste their lives like these, when they would have done better to think things through, strategise and THEN go after the enemy fully prepared and grind the bastards to dust??!! wonder if it really happens like this when the heat is on. but I am digressing!  back to better things, the story never wavered from its main plot, which was the maturing of Hrithik from a spoilt brat who wants to join the army only because of peer pressure/an act of rebellion against his parents into a brave officer, ready to take on the enemy and lay down his life for the country. no lengthy,weepy flashbacks of the other actors' lives, no sleep-inducing tirades against the Pakis, none of the jingoistic attitude that all post-Kargil movies display. In fact, in one of the scenes in the beginning, I was surprised to hear the Big B mouth the outdated words "humaara padosi mulk" rather than blatantly say "Pakistan", as is the norm since Sarfarosh (another favorite of mine), but thankfully none of this politically correct everyone-knows-who-they-are-but-dont-say-it-out-loud-so-as-not-to-offend-sensibilities attitude elsewhere in the movie!   scenes that i choked on  - How Karan(Hrithik) starts off explaining to Romi(Preity) that he has eventually found a 'lakshya', that of recapturing a peak crucial to the outcome of the battle, and midway, is overcome by emotion and sorrow at the martyrdom/injuries of many of his regiment mates in the initial attack.  - When Karan and Romi meet before he is going on the perilous final mission, both of them try to tell each other of their love, end up not even being able to hug each other in the rather incongrous surroundings.  - When Karan calls up his father(Boman Irani), and theirs has never been a comfortable relationship mind you, on the night before the mission, and tells him he loves and respects him for all he has done for him. And when Irani breaks down and confesses how he boasts about his son who is risking his life at the front, to his entire business circle of friends, and how proud he is of Karan.   twists and turns that didnt go down very well with me  - the abruptness with with Romi announces that she is done with Karan when he tells her he has come back from the IMA without completing his training. Agreed that it wasnt the best thing to do in the world, and that Romi is a modern,non-nonsense woman who knows her mind and whos very clear about her own goals and ambitions, but wouldn't someone want to think longer before they walk away from a person who they have been in a serious relationship for a considerable time?  - the rather tame surrender of the Pakis in the end, especially after the build-up to the final attack, with the Paki major in charge shown to be quite shrewd,bloodthirsty and ambitious, and certainly not someone who is afraid of death?   scenes that gave me goosebumps  - when all the cadets throw their hats in the air at the completion of the graduation ceremony at the IMA. - when a small party of our soldiers scale the 8000-ft high and steep peak in a bid to take the Pakis at the top by surprise. this breathtaking and gut-wrenching sequence alone is enough to go see the movie on the 70mm (you didnt watch LOTR/Harry Potter/Spiderman on your TV now, did you?) amazing, amazing footage. - when Karan plants the tricolor on the top of the peak (which incidentally is the sensible and powerful end of the movie and which earns it 100 extra brownie points from me)  looking forward to seeing  urlLink Lakshya  again, this time on the big screen!

       Say that again?  :  urlLink what emotion dominates you?    How do I find out?  :  urlLink Quizilla     Oh?! :   Loneliness dominates you. You can hide it well, but its there, and your friends can see it. You constantly feel alone, and need to do things to fill your time. You are afraid to tell people this, but sooner or later it gets out in a bad way, and you think you screwed up everything. And when you are in love is when you are sad the most.     Really??  :    Loneliness dominates you.   : Rewrite that with Bold, Impact, 36 and it would still be an understatement.   You can hide it well.   : Oh but I cant, what wouldnt I give NOT to hear it from even casual acquaintances : "Hey, everything okay? you look a bit washed out today.."   but its there.   : yeah, yeah, in plenty   and your friends can see it.   : Even my neighbor's dog can. Someone(a homo sapient btw) just IMed me : "what happened to you? you were looking max frustrated yesterday." and this when i thought i had carried off the unenviable task of putting on a happy face and indulge in inane conversation quite well, when that was the last thing i wanted to do!   You constantly feel alone.   : Are you surprised? And is it that bad to feel alone?   and need to do things to fill your time.   : well, doesn't everyone? i at least dont do drugs/sleep around/booze to glory. And my panacea seems to have shifted from reading to blogging!   You're afraid to tell people this   : I am NOT!!!! I can go on and on and on about it, till I drive them away. I deserve a sort of self-deprecating pleasure in talking about my troubles.   but sooner or later it gets out in a bad way   : Gotcha! It cant get worse than this, and im not one for bottling up emotions. I prefer to get things off my chest, till the time my woes start pouring out of other people's ears. why else do you think this this blog exists?   and you think you screwed up everything.   : nothing new for me.   And when you are in love is when you are sad the most.   : Huh? What kinda crap is this? ah, is this supposed to mean that im a loser in love, so that I either love someone I know I can't get or who doesnt care about me, or who wants only to sleep with me, or who is already going around, or who "has always seen me as a friend or a colleague" (sic!), or I can't gather enough courage to tell him how I feel until its too late, or I fail in winning him over, or I behave clumsily around him like a stupid teeny-bopper, or all said and done, i always end up loving someone who doesnt love me back.

      "guess life had an arch like X.. all the connections are messed up." -- Someone,sometime,somewhere,somehow  (X being the bungling architect (popular and critics choice both) on a project we were on at my prev workplace.. but thats a separate story altogether)  my life (if i can boast of having any) is a mess because :  #1 : i cant stand rejection  #2 : my ego hurts that he found someone "better" to love her enough to spend the rest of his life with her, to come home to her every night, to wake up besides her every morning, have kids with her, comfort her when she cries, find solace in her when he is upset, talk to her through the night, tell her jokes, always be ready with a witty repartee to pull her leg, laugh at her eccentricities, tell her how lovely she looks, pick dresses for her, let her pick clothes for him, insist her to wear his fave color, worry about her if she gets late in getting back from work, make love to her, spring up little romantic surprises on her, take her out to candlelight dinners, whisper sweet nothings in her ear, try to hold her hand while driving, talk to her every few hours just to hear her voice, to celebrate festivals with her, to have her fast for him, to feel proud of her, to want to make her happy, to have pillow fights with her, to lust for her at times, to make her feel wanted in his special way etc etc etc.. ad nauseum..  #3 : i wanted him for myself, hence i cant digest the fact that someone else got what i wanted, nay, what i craved for for the past two years..  #4 : With almost nothing else going right for me these days, it was like "please God, let him love me back and i wont ever ask you for anything else" .. crappy/mushy/life doesnt work that way? i know, doesnt stop me from wishing it did though..  #5 : havent been able to find out a way to induce selective amnesia in myself, seem to still remember every lil bit about him, his voice, face, smile.. (see another weepy post in the May archives for details; if you have been able to stand reading up till here, chances are you would most probably survive that post too.. but probability is a funny thing!).. and now theres "her" to contend with too.. everytime i see a pretty woman on the road, i wonder if she is her.. everytime i close my eyes and try to sleep, i start thinking about the two of them together.. yes i am a selfish bitch.. i am not noble or great enough to feel happy for him.. rather im jealous as hell..   #6 : we never had a relationship, he didnt love me at all, and he was honest enough to tell me first off that he just thought of me as a "desirable woman who i would want to sleep with".. i have always run after him.. always tried to find hidden meaning behind his words and actions, he never reciprocated.. i kept persisting.. even when he told me that "there was never an us and there never will be, and im really sorry about that, but nothings gonna change that" .. i didnt pay any heed.. he told me in march he was going to get married later this year.. i thought that he had invented "her" to get rid of me and my ravings and rantings.. self-denial mode, or some such crap, they call it.. thats why this was such a big shock for me.. i guess i have always thought of him as a footloose and fancy-free guy.. not really keen to get into a long-term relationship or marriage.. guess that tells that i really didnt know him well.. prolly didnt love him too.. yeah prolly i just lusted for him.. prolly i just wanted to sleep with him.. i dont fucking now.. all i know is that i have always had this weird and irrational hope that he would "come back" to me someday somehow.. (friggin bollywood movies!).. and so the news was almost physically painful.. whereas i should be feeling happy for the sweetest possible guy on earth.. he could have fooled me.. slept with me.. and dumped me.. but he always was polite and indifferent and chivalrously discouraging everytime i started off on touchy topics.. oh how i envy her.. gosh.. i hope i get rid of this utterly empty feeling inside me soon.. or else it would drive me crazy..  #7 : since the last year when i switched jobs, i have had more than enough time on my hands than i know what to do with, and since i am "blessed" with an over-active imagination, i always end up fantasizing about him and me.. and i have always wondered if he is the marrying kind.. guess now i know.. but i dont yet know how to control my way-too-fertile imagination from building castles in the air..  #8 : i cant seem to like any other guy.. comparison with him is the bane of my life.. and no prizes for guessing who wins hands down.. since the last couple of days, i have given quite a bit of thought to my life ahead, and i have found myself flinching from the idea of any other guy touching me, feel repulsed at the thought, dont think i can ever love anyone else again.. i know these feelings will fade away with the passage of time (or at least i hope they will) but if theres one thing im sure about.. it is that i will never be able to forget him.. (and please dont think i havent tried, honestly i have, since i have got to know of his marriage).. and if and when i get married, everytime something goes wrong, my knee-jerk reaction would be to think that i would have been happier had it been Him.. gosh.. this scares me no end.. believe me.. this scares me no bloody end.. i dont fucking want to spend the rest of my life thinking about what-might-have-been.. God i DONT!!!! and it doesnt help that im filled with a bitterness against the world that i cant put in words, i have been getting into regular spats at home, i literally snap at everyone who talks to me, i cant concentrate on my work.. whatever little bit there is, my self-esteem is at an all-time low.. outrageous compliments and flirting by male colleagues/friends makes me happy these days..coz true or not, it acts as a balm to my bruised ego..  oh fuck it all.. why am i going on and on about someone who never loved me in the first place and made it so transparently clear??!!!!! i dont fucking know!!!! thats what makes it all the more irritating.. probably what a friend of mine told me is right after all.. that i am obsessed about him.. i think so too.. but the q is what do i do now?? do i go and have a fling with someone just for the heck of it?? i guess part of the problem is that i have never been in a relationship with someone.. so i tend to look at such things with rose-tinted glasses, prolly if had gone around with him for some time, i would have realised that though being in love is beautiful, its not always as glorious and hunky-dory as i have made it out to be in my juvenile imagination.. and he may be perfect for me only in my imagination too.. after all there must be something to the old adage 'familiarity breeds contempt'??  but now that any chance whatsoever to do that has been snatched away from me, i cant seem to see the harsh realities.. all i keep mooning about is what-might-have-been!  hope.. rather sincererly and fervently hope that in a year or so from now, i would be laughing my insides out/turning beetroot red with embarassment at the fucking asshole im being right now..  
     
      in the past couple of days.. colleagues (the hi-hows-work-ciao types) have been coming up and saying things like :  #1 : Happy-go-lucky-and-amazingly-witty dude : "Hey, is everything okay? You seem to have lost 7-8 kilos of weight, if not more.I hope everything is alright" and just yesterday, "whoever told you to keep losing weight was crazy.this is perfectly okay.lady, what have you done to yourself?you look like a shadow of yourself'. Me : "Shadows are black,not tanned". (Yeah, I almost always try to come up with a smartass remark, even if the other person means well)  #2 : Cool-Bbay-Technowhiz-ardent-reader-and-quizzer dude : a concise and correct "You look different".Keeps looking at me to see what exactly it is that prompted him to say that.I interrupt his musings with "For better or for worse?". He refuses to be impolite and gives me a grin as he walks away.  #3: Sweet-Honest-Propah-Easily-Shocked-By-My-Eccentricities-Helpful dude : calls me up (though he sits just a couple of bays away) and says "you havent been looking happy since you came back from vacation. Is anything wrong? I may not be able to help, but its..." (gropes for a politically-correct thing to say prolly).. i butt in with a helpful "always good to get things off your chest?".. agrees with me and signs off with a "take care and keep smiling" after i assure him that no catastrophe has interrupted my mundane existence. (im not always nasty, now am i?)  #4 :  New-hire-I-happened-to-interview-and-since-then-in-unnecessary-awe-of-me-dude : "hey, i am sorry i didnt recognize you when you came down to 2nd floor yesterday, you looked so (yes, you guessed it!) different" (im beginning to think of the word as a euphemism these days) "so im sorry if i sounded funny initially"  #5 : : Cute-giggly-pretty-if-slightly-overpossessive dudette : to a friend of mine "whats happened to her? she looks so down these days" .. truth to tell, i felt rather pleasantly surprised by her concern coz she and i have a blow-hot-blow-cold kinda relationship.. but the suspicious side of me raises its ugly head and says "what if she was on a fishing trip?"  touched that some people who i didnt think did actually cared enough to ask.. and wondering why some others who i thought were closer friends of mine or knew me better didnt even notice the change? Or probably they did, and just didnt want to comment, considering my volatile temper and the propensity to bawl given the slightest reason and opportunity.. anyways..
     
      he got married.
     
      is that i wont be posting for a while.. a week to be precise..  why?? need to give my can-be-counted-on-fingertips (actually, thats an exaggeration!) readers a much well-deserved break or some such noble thought?? naaahhh.. im not that generous.. not planning to accompany the olympic torch to its next destination either (come to think of it, have no hangups doing it if samsung sponsor my trip and 'other expenses', read shopping, shopping and more shopping till i drop.. and then some.. i can crawl and shop too :P)...  moi goin on a week-long vacation, starting tomorrow.. to my assorted collection of relatives spread over the chaotic towns and bylanes of Uttar Pradesh.. think i will enjoy meeting up with mamis, mausis, uncles, aunts and cousins of all sizes, shapes, ages and hues i havent met since ages.. :)  heres hoping that the blog world doesnt come to a standstill without my extremely valuable contributions to it.. :P
     
      nah.. im not in any of my cry-baby/sulking/cribbing/bitching/wallowing-in-self-pity moods.. but got this beautiful poem as one of the  urlLink PravsJ  mails, and it sooooo _aptly_ captures my feelings since.... awww.. there i go again :)  so here goes..  I saw your face today, in the face of a stranger But when I looked again, you were not there anymore  I heard your voice today, in the middle of a crowd I turned around to listen, but did not hear a sound  I felt your touch today, in the blowing wind I clung to that moment, held it to the end  I cried over you today, drowned in my own sorrow Then I came to realize There is always a tomorrow    Amen!  
     
      little did i know when i installed this intellectual-sounding-and-heavy-duty phrase (arent all latin phrases so btw?) as my just-for-the-heck-of-it yahoo status message, that it would lead to soooo many folks buzzing me left,right and center, demanding to know what exactly i mean by the tongue-twister in front of my name....  the reactions ranged from "what the hell is that in front of your name?", to 'yeh kya bhaasha hai bhai?" (this coming from someone who normally doesnt talk in hindi at all, guess he wanted to get back at me by talking in an "alien" language too :P) to the polite "translate that for me please" to the eloquent "what the f**k????!!!"..  all in all, a good way to catch up with people you have lost in touch with.. coz believe you me, a catchy status message makes people want to come up with a witty q or a remark, and in the process you catch up with friends, colleagues and acquaintances who have drifted away over time..   wondering why do i sound almost cocky about the whole deal?? coz since the latin one-liner, everytime i want to feel 'wanted and needed and talked to and talked about' and all that crap..basically whenever i want attention, i just put on a flashy yahoo message.. :">  some of my current "attention-grabbers" :  -  "Do you mind if I talk while you interrupt?"  - most popular with me coz it makes people real crazy.. :) ..usually like to do it when im in the middle of a conversation with a bunch of people in separate windows.. lets people im talking with into rare bouts of self-introspection, whether it was something that said that prompted the change in status.. sometimes get a diffident "hey, was it something i said?" and then pretend to be generous and say "oh no cmon YOU are too much of a sweetheart to say anything which can provoke such a reaction" :D  -  "Can I sue life for being a bitch?"  - most of the responses are pf the type "lets sue jointly" and "wow, why didnt i think of it before?"  -  "like WHAT????!!!!!"  - this utterly nonsensical bit of text as my status message results in numerous instances of windows popping all over my screen (and slowing further my already-could-give-competition-to-a-486 P3 .. but thats another story) echoing the same profundity.. like WHAT????!!!!!  -  "Which umbrella drink are you?"  - this was prompted by a test i took at  urlLink colorgenics .. and it gets even self-proclaimed teetotalers to respond :)  -  "If I am not back in ten minutes... wait longer"  - my all-time fave "away" message.. serves to irritate and annoy people like no other message i have ever encountered.. :D..psst.. in case you can lay claim to a message which can tick people off even more, please do enlighten me too :D  - and finally,  "Si hoc legere scis, nimis eruditionis habes."  - and to any curious what/why/hows, i say : "Si tu dixero, necesse erit ut tu interficiam." :P 
     
      - a digicam - a long flared pristine white skirt - a sequinned bag - Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat - a slimmer waist (so that i can fit into that elegant blue skirt i bought last week at SN, even though i _KNEW_ for a fact beforehand that theres no way i can fit into it even if i fold myself into half!) - a leather handbag, preferably black - yahoo messenger at work - tickets for Hum Tum and Harry Potter 3 - a new music system for the car - an A/C for the car - a laptop - a face without acne  and though its superficial to add, to get most of this and lots more, a paycheque in pounds rather than INRs..  nothing wrong in dreaming, eh?
     
        Don't jump the gun. I may be a lazy bum, and I may be suffering from more than my fair share of monotony lately; does NOT mean that I will c hoary PJs here. Instead, I will do something equally insipid : recount a couple of my adventures in YIM land. (YIM = Yahoo Messenger in geekspeak, doesnt show that I am a geek, rather the fact that I am surrounded by them most of my waking hours.)   Yahoo Messenger, just like those Ekta Kapoor serials, has been a constant source of ecstasy, tears, mischief, hope, embarassment and inspiration for me since I was introduced to it five years ago. I have come a long way, from the time when I used to get absolutely thrilled as the instant response appeared on my screen minutes after I sent a friend a message, to now, when a time lag of more than a few seconds between messages makes me write back all kinds of unmentionable adjectives to friends, acquaintances and foes alike.   Some of my notable YIM achievements include pinging my Project Manager by mistake to ask him how soon I should let the 'leadership' know about my intended job switch (I still get ragged about that), getting proposed to, and getting caught while chatting with a false nick to size up the latest Greek God at the workplace.   Here I reproduce (as best my memory allows me to) a couple of   urlLink  ROFLMAO   ing conversations. Folks screaming blue murder at the duplication of what essentially were private conversations, please don't read further!   This is how convo #1 went:   Moi : hey  Dude#1 : hai  Moi : Can you send me those jars please? I need to start cracking on the rest of the code.  Dude#1 : will be sending today afternoon.  Moi : come again??!! i thought those files were taken care of a couple of days ago?  Dude#1 : i cannot come to your seat right now. I am working.  Moi : er.... okie.. so will you send them across by 2 today?  Dude#1 : ok  Moi : cool  Dude#1 : but I am not angry!  Moi : :)   I love these smileys; more often than not, they save me from getting into further trouble. I dont know what that guy would have written back had I hurled a ROTFL or a LMAO at him. Anyhow, he is working with Accenture these days, guess the guys over there too employ a different version of Queen's English than mine!   Convo#2 happened quite recently :   Dude#2 : hi hows life?  Moi : hey.. same old same old, you say?  Dude#2 : nothing much, whatcha upto right now?  Moi : going for breakfast, wanna come along?  Dude#2 : no you go ahead, i will cum later on.   Er, either I am hopelessly out-of-sync with the latest lingo in use, or I have a dirtier mind than most.   Well, I guess my office isn't always as uninteresting a place as I make it out to be!
