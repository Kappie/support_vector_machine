Actually gonna be pretty good.  Very busy at work today. Got a little short w/ John cause of this whole July 10 show thing. I feel really bad about the situation, and was still willing to do it.  I knew I would be dead after that weekend though.  Then through all of the emailing back and forth John started taking things I was saying out of context.  It can be fun to email back and forth, but at the same time it can be bad because you can't read sarcasm and sometimes you may write something one way and someone will read it another way.  Anyway, I think it is resolved but I am just stressed out and I want to book more shows but I don't see that happening any time soon.  Exhausted need to rest.
