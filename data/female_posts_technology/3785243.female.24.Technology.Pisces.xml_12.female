I like this part:  "Hulk saw movie about bug-man and it was good but needed more smashing.  AND HULK DID NOT GET SNIFFLY DURING ROMANTIC SCENES SO IF YOU HEAR IRON MAN OR THOR TALKING ABOUT IT THEY ARE LIARS."  I wonder how long it will be before Corporate America starts suing the pants off of these people?  :(  Too bad, because this is way better than anything coming out of the Hollywood scene.  -- Aeryth
