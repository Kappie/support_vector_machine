By the description on their web site, BlogShares is "a simulated, fantasy stock market for weblogs where players invest fictional money to buy stocks and bonds in an artificial economy where attention is the commodity and weblogs are the companies."  My trading price as of this writing is $47.80.  The way that it seems to work is just like the stock market, except that it's fake.  I currently only own about 10 shares of my own blog, because that's all I could afford with the requisite $500 of fake money they gave me.  If nothing else, BlogShares could be a good lesson in trading on the stock market.    This reminds me of the movie that Wayne had me watch this weekend called  urlLink Trading Places  (1983) with Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd.  It was about what happens when two brokerage firm owners make a bet that they can take their best trader and make him "trade places" with a bum off the street just by changing the environment they're given.  Despite all of the bad eighties clothes and pop culture references, it wasn't a bad movie.  There is a part where they are on the trading floor, and it reminded me of when Wayne and I went to Chicago last month and visited the  urlLink Chicago Mercantile Exchange .  There were all sorts of people running around in different colored jackets, waving hand signals at each other and frantically filling out order slips.  Those bunch of goofy looking people were probably littered with millionaires, though.  It was organized chaos.
