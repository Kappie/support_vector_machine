I know how much of a pain it is to find that stuff when you have the source code; it's got to be impossible when you don't.  I made the switch to the  urlLink Netscape  browser, and at the risk of sounding like one of those anti-Microsoft super geeks, I like it a lot better.   I still don't run Linux on my home machine, so that is my exemption card.
