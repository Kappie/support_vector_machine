Walter and I went to see the Broadway musical  Movin' Out  at the Paramount.  It was amazing!!  Exactly my kind of show.  Music by Billy Joel (they play lots of his greatest hits) and Choreography by Twyla Tharp.  The dancers are amazing and it tells a good story too.  There's this great scene where a girl in a red dress gets proposed to.  It's cool to see that done through dance.  There's another really cool dance where a couple is having a fight and they are kind of pushing each other around while still dancing.  A few times the guy lifts the girl and looks like he's going to drop her.  It does a fabulous job of getting across the emotional struggle between them.  The *lights* were amazing too.  I think my best part of the whole show was the very beginning.  The music, and lighting were perfect.  It left you with this exhilaration for the rest of the first act.  I LOVED it and if anyone has tickets and wants to see it again before it leaves Seattle on the 20th, I'm in.  urlLink www.movinoutonbroadway.com
