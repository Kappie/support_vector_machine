James, best known for his 1981 hit "Super Freak," had received a recent surge of popularity due to Dave Chappelle's lampooning of him on the Chappelle Show. While James struggled for much of his life with drug addiction, authorities say there appeared to be no drugs involved with his death; in the coming weeks, an autopsy will confirm or deny that thought.
