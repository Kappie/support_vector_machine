Hopefully, ten of them will be before my anniversary trip with Wayne to the San Francisco bay area.    In order to keep me on track, I am using the  urlLink Slim-Fast  program as a guide, though I typically eat one of their convenience meals and two other healthful meals during the day.  I like it because it's convenient and easy, but I have recieved criticism.  Yes, I'm also exercising, and yes, I know that just cutting calories isn't the answer.  Trying to eat balanced meals and exercise more is my goal, and I lost about 13 pounds before using this same method.  I can't go without a little bread and pasta, so the low-carb thing is out of the question.       One week in, I'm down 3 pounds.
