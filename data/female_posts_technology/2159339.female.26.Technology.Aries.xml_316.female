The answer to this chilling depression is to (as Balki Bartakamous would say): "Get out of the city!" So far this summer, I've attended nine BBQs, 5 of them in hot sunny places a short drive from SF. Exotic, foreign, tropical locations such as Walnut Creek, Oakland, Milpitas, and Stinson Beach. These places have warm weather and clear blue skies. The heat is terrific. (So terrific in fact that I often retreat to milder conditions indoors.)   Two days ago, I hitched a ride with Jason and Green Marble to Stinson Beach for our friend Alden's 30th-bday BBQ. The best part about this fete was the whole roasted pig that was transported to the beach for our consumption. Oh my god, it was so good. Crisp crackly skin, juicy melt-in-your-mouth flesh, and a sweet peppery liver sauce that's drizzled on top of your portion.  Sigh.  Despite my valley girl accent, I'm a Vietnamese girl at heart, and I appreciate the rare occasions that call for a whole roasted pig. In my family there are only two occasions that guarantee one: the festive engagement ceremony and a ceremony celebrating the birth of a new baby. Everytime a Vietnamese baby is born, a pig dies. Such is the circle of life. The delicious mouth-watering circle of life... I love my Filipino friends because they commemorate special occasions with pigs too. And they're into chafing dishes! That is so so awesome. Portable units that keep food warm are so so awesome.  Also awesome about this particular BBQ were the group shots. There were rounds of Jack Daniels and rounds of Absolut Citron among other rounds that I had to sit out on. Sometimes when I'm at a staid BBQ, I think "God, everyone here should just get together and take a shot." But instead of shots, I'm just assaulted with more awkward silence and flaccid questions like what do I do and how do I know the host. This is what I endure to get cheeseburgers and grilled tri-tip. But this BBQ was all food, no work: cheeseburgers, grilled tri-tip, spicy papaya salad, mini lumpia, sausage-laden spaghetti, hot dogs, fresh oysters, roasted chickens, rice, creamed chicken breast... and of course, the pig. The lovely pig that oinked, "Screw your BMI worries, Batty. Eat me!"
