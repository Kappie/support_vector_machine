There was also the incident on Sunday night/Monday morning of yelling at the parking attendant at SFO for taking too long with a car three cars in front of me. Having read the sign that said “$1 for every 12 minutes”, I asked him whether “I can get a dollar off for having waited in the fucking line for at least 12 minutes”...He didn’t say anything.   Last night, while submerged underwater in my bathtub, where I do all my best thinking, I realized that I’m doing these foolish things because M is pissing me off so bad I want to rip his balls off, but instead I have completely shut down. It was after my bath that I drank the absinthe in one big gulp and while back in the bathroom staring at the inside of my toilet, I realized that I would rather have my sanity than M.   So I finally told him everything. About how happy I was when he called me from DC to tell me that he misses me and how much I looked forward to seeing him and how I thought that we had finally gotten over our growing pains and that things could now be great, even if only for three weeks. And then I told him how he shattered my fantasies in less than a minute when he came out of the plane hugging some girl from his conference and then came up to me and asked me for his cigarettes without as much as a hello. I said I didn’t want to go camping this weekend with him and his friends and that I want space until our road trip. He said that if I didn’t go he didn't want to go either. We went back and forth for a while (while simultaneously reading subtitles of  Shoalin Soccer ) until I agreed to think about it. So I'm thinking (about what a fucking dickhead he can be).
