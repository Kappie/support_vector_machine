I have to bust ass if I want to do these shows coming up which I do.  In the next couple of weeks any free time I have I am going to have to work on these songs. He gave me a DVD to watch of them w/ Anne.  Don't imitate her he says as he was leaving.  Imitate her? Man I don't imitate anyone, I am myself and always will be. LOL That could not necessarily be a good thing.  Ha ha ha Talked to Mr Mike on the way home, the group misses me. I don't go out much anymore.  I have like no time these days, and they wanted me to go out but they have to understand that if I have the opportunity to practice that will be first priority. They all should, they are all musicians. I just checked my email and he emailed me a simple note saying "love u" How should I take that? You never know w/ him. Not going to even ask him about it cause he will get all bent out of shape. Although I do remember emailing something to all my friends months ago about love and he replied telling me love was non existent! He really hurt my feelings, but it won't be the first or last time I'm sure.  We have such a bizarre friendship, but I love him anyway. Anyhow hopefully I will be practicing again this Sat night. We will see what happens! Laterz
