I felt pretty good this weekend, after soaking in the hot tub on Friday and getting my nails done on Thursday. Pampering can do a world of good for me, let me tell ya. Hmm, the house honeydo's are soooo coming along and it looks so nice and homy. I love it. I think hubby does too.  Baby Boy is off the grounding and he is ok, however I think something dramatic is up in his world. Baby Girl comes home tomorrow and the three of us begin the last week before school week/weekend/birthday extravaganza.  That's right, it is my 36th year and Baby Girl's 7th. WOWOW. I can't believe it, yet I can. :)  I want of course to make this birthday symbolic of something for me, not sure what yet. Blogging has helped a great deal. So has written blogging.  The drama with our families has slowed down mostly due to us just saying no. My Baby Boy stood up to one of them via telephone and it was very dramatic, yet empowering for him, yet, sad, because he shouldn't have to deal with it.  Ok, enough for now, make this week matter, make a difference, be happy and be good to you.
