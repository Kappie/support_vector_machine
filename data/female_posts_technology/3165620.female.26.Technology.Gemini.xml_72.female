(Not that I ever would, mind you. *grin*) Welcome and enjoy, Mom.   My blog also has a poetic comment from a total stranger. Cool! I guess it has been up long enough to be noticed. I'll have to take a closer look at her blog sometime, too. I'll save that for at-home websurfing, though. It's too easy to be sucked into reading extensive webpages so I must avoid such activity at work.
