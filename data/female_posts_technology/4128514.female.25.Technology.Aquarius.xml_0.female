I had to take pictures going inside this morning, in typical "mommy" style.  Now if he'd only had a perfect day, it would've been complete.  But nooo, he has to go and play in the water and soak his shirt, because "all my friends were playing too".  So he ended up in minor trouble.  But it could've been way worse.  And he made my day when we got home.  Sometimes kids do little things that let you know that as much as you fuss at them, they really are listening.  We stopped at the grocery store to pick up a few things.  Normally, I take everything in the house when we get home, but I let the boy carry one bag...you know, give him just a lil responsibility.  But of course he complains...every single time.  Today, though, I didn't give him anything to carry, I just sent him towards the door... he asked me "Mommy, you don't want me to carry anything?"  I was so happy..he actually does know he's supposed to help out!!!  Yea!!!...I am a good mommy...LOL  Sometimes its the little things that give you pleasure.
