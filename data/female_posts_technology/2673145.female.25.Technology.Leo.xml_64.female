To make time pass real fast, my life is packed with travel plans. Always looking forward to the NEXT trip when I'm on a trip. I'm always reminded of fun activities that's coming up. But I think I should make everyday as exciting, as worth while, as possible. Like "they" said, live life to the fullest. That seem to be the toughest thing to do on Earth.   I often draw out plans in my head when I'm day dreaming, stoning, staring blindly at the road infront. Plans like, taking art classes, go to more aerobics classes, fix the computer, call a friend out, etc.. I wish I could change my lazy bones. I wish I could seize the day. The mind is willing, the flesh is weak. What can be worst? I'm denying myself, I'm in my own illusion, I'm being complacent.. like everyone else.   I know what I need. Motivation!   I think I have to stop writting my thoughts down. They seem unpleasant, boring, draggy, naggy, pessimistic, to read. The next posting should be something happier. :) Haaha
