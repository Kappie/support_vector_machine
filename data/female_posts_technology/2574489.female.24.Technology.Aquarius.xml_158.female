My mom's reign as Reyna Elena was a direct result of her win as  urlLink Miss Valentines  last February. My Dad could have been escorting her but he was gone for a wedding in Chicago. My brother took his place!      The Reyna Elena and her escort, my brother (Man in Black)    The cute kids     The little angel    I asked her to pose for me. Such bright colors! I love our flag!    I call this picture "windblown".     And here's the empanada my dad brought back!    And here is my family taking over my dining room.  Click for more pics  urlLink here .
