Here's her take on the night:  urlLink skirts, seesound  sweating . I love stripes! We quickly moved to Bada where it was much cooler (literally). Karen brought herfine gentlemen again. Matt introduced me to Grey Goose Gimlets. Those things are good! Mark was his usual funny guy self. Fil was there too. Karen's supposed to bring him shopping. I can't wait to see what he wears next weekend! I feel kind of bad because James bought me a drink and then I kind of disappeared. I can't remember why. Lindsey and I had fun dancing as Vaughn watched from afar. Boys are funny. I didn't really break out too much of the hip hop moves. Maybe after this week's class...   Here'sKaren and mein our fun skirts:   urlLink     urlLink More Pics    Saturday night I saw iRobot with CJ, Chris, Jason, Walter,  Julie. I didn't go out afterwards because I wanted to get up early and do errands. Didn't exactly work out for me. I woke up at 1pm. My timing is really strange.   Sunday night I went to an AWESOME CONCERT with Chris. We saw Barenaked Ladies and Alanis Morissette. I got a sticker that says "I love the Ladies". I would have gotten a shirt but they were $30 and I'm trying to cut back. Only bought 2 purses this weekend. Oops! FTR, they were both on sale. Anyway, the concert was SO COOL. Chris is a member of the BNL fan club so we were literally in the 7th row right in front of the stage. I could see the color of Ed's beautiful eyes. I was mainly going to hear BNL, but it turned out that Alanis put on a fabulous show. It was inspiring in a girl power sort of way. I'm going to buy one of her CDs. Well I would if I hadn't cut myself off from shopping.   Today I did 500 million errands, but I still have many to go. B is at the beach with his family. I'm kind of bummed I didn't get to go this year, but there's too much going on in Seattle with my move. Plus I want to spend as much time here as I can. I'm getting kind of sad about leaving, especially all the fun people. I don't even want to think about it.
