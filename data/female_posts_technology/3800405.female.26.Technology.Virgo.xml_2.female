I didn't buy any nice furniture or decorations because it didn't make sense to spend $$ on furniture meant for an apartment I wouldn't be in for long. Ha ha, the joke's on me, I've been living like a college student all this time for it.    Those days are done- a few months ago I decided to bite the bullet and start looking for a house. A permanent, all-mine, no-shared-walls house. I eventually got an agent and started looking at houses and this past week I found it. Split entry, with finished daylight basement, deck, 3BR, and more than twice the square footage than my dinky little apartment. I put an offer on it and it was accepted that night! So, come the end of August (which, coincidentally is my birthday) I close on my first house!        I now have a packed schedule of things I need to do to make sure I'm not screwing myself - deadlines for contingencies, applying for loans and insurance, review paperwork on the house... Having only been through the process of simply offering to buy the house, I'm already dumbfounded at the amount of paperwork it takes to do this. Saying "can I buy your house" took 25 pages alone!  Stay tuned for more on my adventures in moving...
