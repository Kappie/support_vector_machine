Not much happened, except the brilliant idea to take a bottle of champagne and go to the top of a mall - to see the holiday fireworks.   and incidentally - whoever says that he weather people don't have it down is full of it. They "predicted" that it would start to rain at midnight, and on the dot - 12 am precisely it began to come down. It wasn't torrential or anything like that, but I'd like to think that it was earth's way of cleansing itself for the new year....Starting fresh maybe. Or some bullshit like that.   oh well...Me waxing philosophical at the turn of the new year already. Have fun nursing your hangovers today kiddies! (incidentally the BEST hangover cure? - Bloody Mary with McDonalds!! And maybe a bromo on the side)  Kisses to make up for the ones I missed last night!
