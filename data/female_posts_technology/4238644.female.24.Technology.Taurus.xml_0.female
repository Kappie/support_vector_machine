I live for Fridays and am not enjoying my job anywhere near as much as I used to. It's alright, but I guess the saving grace of my sanity is the people I have the pleasure of working with. I've made some good friends at work and we all get to bitch about how much our jobs suck. I never used to do that a year or so ago.... I need that footy tipping prize, get away from it all at the company's expense. ;)      9 weeks and 2 days to go (but who's counting?)
