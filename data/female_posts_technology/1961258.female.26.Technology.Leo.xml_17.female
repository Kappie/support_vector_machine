They're supposed to be one-size fits all but according to the measurements, I'm either at the higher end of it or I won't fit into it! So yes, I DO have to lose weight and at least get back to 155 which was where I was about 8 months ago, then we'll work it out as we go along.   My weight fluctuates between 77.1 to 77.5kg, but yesterday it was a little over 78kg after lunch. So about 170 - 173lbs. Way too much! I'm always like this .. I gain 15 - 20lbs in like nothing, then I go .. wow, where did it come from? It's so unimaginable sometimes.    My diet has improved. I read an article in Oxygen magazine, which has way too buff women .. but it is right the way they eat. They eat every couple of hours - 9 am, 12 pm, 3 pm, 6 pm, 9 pm. Small meals and snacks. I'm trying that .. and hopefully will stick to drinking protein shakes for my snacks. So far so good, they fill me up.   I'll focus on the diet first and then incorporate a little exercise. So far nothing actually .. wow, I haven't exercised in a while. I do some toning for my arms and legs once in awhile, but it's really not enough. I need to do more cardio and interval training, I see great results with that.
