Elves are known to speak in riddles just to drive us completely crazy so they can smirk behind our backs.  It truly is all harmless but I agree.  Even though we are given safe passage, this forest still gives me the creeps."  Morrigan inched closer to Aidan for comfort.  She looked around the forest though she couldn't see much.  Darkness had fallen and only shadows of bushes and trees could be seen.  Not even the moon or stars could reach through the thick blanket of leaves.  An owl hooted in the distance mostly likely chasing after a mouse.    "It's too quiet isn't it?"  She whispered to Aidan.  "Yes, it is, but I like it.  It was always so noisy in the village at least the part I lived in.  You probably didn't notice the noise living on the edge like you did."  Morrigan felt his arm reach around her and pulled her tightly against him.  "You know, you can both go to sleep now."  A small voice spoke on Morrigan's left close to a bush.  Morrigan sat up and looked closely at the bush until she saw the small outline of a gnome.  She smiled.  "Hello there.  Did you keep watch over us last night?"  "Yes I did and so did the wood nymph."  The gnome said gruffly.  "Thank you so much.  May I ask your name?"  Morrigan asked quietly.  She felt Aidan shift his weight so he could see who was speaking.  "No, you may not.  I wish to be unknown at least until after everything is cleared up."  "We will turn in now so you can keep watch."  She squeezed Aidan's arm and pushed herself off the log to lay down on the ground.  She felt Aidan lay down beside her and pull her close.  She leaned close to his ear and whispered. "That's a gnome."  She felt Aidan squeeze her waist in answer.    All too soon the sounds of the forest acted as a lullaby and Morrigan fell into a deep sleep though filled with restless scenes.  Over and over she kept seeing a red-hair woman who wasn't her mother.  Morrigan could tell she was evil but she couldn't do anything to be released from the grasp of the dream.  Finally after it seemed like years, Morrigan woke enough to return to sleep without dreams.  In the darkness, the gnome smiled as he watch Morrigan fall asleep once more.
