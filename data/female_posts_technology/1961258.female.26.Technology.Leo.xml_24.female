I have that vacation coming up where I have to be in a swimsuit .. because what else are you supposed to do at a seaside resort? No swimsuit yet but I am dreading shopping for it totally. I know I'm huge and plus size by any standard, and here .. pfft .. it's worse since the sizes run so small anyways. My hips are at the very least 40 - 41" which is HUGE .. and let's not mention my thighs or my waist or whatever. I mean no matter how proportionate I am, it doesn't matter .. I'm big. Look at how shopping for undies went .. I just couldn't find something that would fit me right and hopefully the stuff I got off eBay would work better (and cheaper too). So what chances would I have with a swimsuit? I want to swim and windsurf and kayak and parasail and all that fun stuff you do half naked (which I LOVE to do, am such a water baby) but .. I'll keep on thinking about my gross thighs exposed and stuff like that! Argh! I think I'd look amazing in one of those classic suits like 50s style, Marilyn Monroe style .. don't you think? :)   I was reading a magazine earlier today and there was these stats of how Australian women changed over the years - an Aussie mag. And of course, there was one about their weights and stats and such. So the 'average' Aussie woman is 68kg and has so  so centimetres for their waist or hips. But, I'm 10 kgs over average .. does that NOT tell me something? Also the US has this the average American woman is 5'4" and 145lbs. I'm like 20 lbs over that! Ouch! So ... is there ever proof that I'm overweight, then all that is it. I WAS average but now I'm not anymore.   But .. it's wonderful that I've heard of these girls who lose 50 lbs. and look AMAZING. One major case in point was this girl who lost 50 lbs. and in the end won the latest America's Next Top Model II. And you know I'm not past that point where I can't do anything about it or change it. The body is a wonderful thing and it CAN bounce back. So yup, will try to get down 50 lbs, as these people have done. A year will do for that, don't you think?
