Whoever is publishing this blog is  urlLink working for an international NGO in Baghdad  and is  urlLink blogging to give a view of what is happening on the ground in Baghdad and elsewhere in Iraq that you might not find in other forums.  Posts signed mysteriously "The View". Good pic's.  Update; (well, I suppose it's a compliment when the Blogeoisie start requesting  urlLink acknowledgments ).
