I didn't wake up till 11:00 though...i had another late night last night but thank god it wasn't as late as other times.  After work, Amanda came over and we picked up my lil cousin Amanda lol. She's gonna stay at my place for a few days while my aunt prepares for a hair styling exam. *tired...* i dunno what to write. I've been really exhausted lately. But then again...that's the way i wanted my summer to be once in a while.  We had every intention of playing man hunt tonight but kevin's thing in hamilton today took way to fucking long. He didn't meet up with me and amanda till 10:45. Amanda and I met up with Tony (guy she's seeing) and his friend uh...I think it's Mickham...amanda things it's Beckham. Oh well. Either or. We went out for a drink at Williams and then went to Sportsworld for a couple games. Afterwards we went to the park for a walk. I REALLY wish we played manhunt cuz the weather was PERFECT! Nice and dark out, a little fog, a bit cool out. Damn it. We BETTER play it next weekend. Supposably Kevin knows of a party he wants me to go along with him to. Hmm. We'll see about that.  Manda and I are talkin online now about being sexually frustrated and shit like that. Good conversation to be honest. No we're NOT weird. I wanted to bring around my video cam today but I forgot it!! *cries* There were so many good moments to film...Wish i didn't miss it.  I'm most likely gonna sleep in tomorrow. maybe sumone can help me find boxes. I REALLY want my new bed before mom and opa go to the phillippines. If not, looks like I'm stuck without furniture. SOMEONE GIVE ME BOXES!!!  My lil cuz amanda and I are playing MArio party right now but I'm getting tired. I should go to bed. Wow. Everyone I'm talking to online is going to bed at this very moment...How wierd...  I'm off to sleep now.   And the day goes on the way you planned.  -The Lonewolf
