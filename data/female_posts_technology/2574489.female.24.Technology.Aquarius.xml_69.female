I went to school last night and joy of all joy, finally finished everything and got to take my first mastery exam.  I mastered it with only 3 questions wrong.  I got home at about 10:30 and hadn't eaten.  I waited for husband and we ate chicken  noodle soup and sandwich.  Then we turned to each other afterwards and knew we were both thinking the same thing: Ice Cream!  One pint, two spoons, eating out of the package. Yum!
