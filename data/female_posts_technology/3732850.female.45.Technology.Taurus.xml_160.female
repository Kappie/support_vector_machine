I think this is  because she sees it as her place of sanity and finds peace and feels free being in her garden.      The story continues with her raking up leaves and then talk of thinking of nurture of animals, humans, and plants in her garden.  She goes into detail of how people tell her that her husand and herself would make great parents and then how they can't have children.  They have thought of adoption but that gets nowhere and the years continue to slip away.      Deb Sullivan then has a focus of her nephews, Ben and Jake.  They are fifteen years old and identical twins.  She loved them from the start with a deep passion.  Probably because this is where she felt closest to someone when not being able to have any children of her own.  They created good memories going camping, boating, and more.      Tragedy strikes with the parents of these boys getting divorced and everything changes.  From Deb Sullivans' point, these boys now have a shattered life.  They have been forced prematurely into adulthood.  She finds she has tears on her face from a cool breeze drifting by and wipes her face.     Her attention turns back to the garden when she wipes dirt from her face from the tears.  She talks of planting Jake and Ben in her Garden wanting nothing more than to keep them safe and nurture them tenderly and to keep them safe from the harsh elements of life.     She realizes she has helped these boys by spending time with them and so refers to it as planting a seed in their lives.  She will continue to pray for them and in hope that the seeds of love she has sown will flourish in their lives.  She has helped to weed out the negatives in their life and also has helped them to make right choices.  She now stands back to watch them grow and turns to her garden, to her peaceful and quite place that gives her comfort where she can be free from the worries of life.     This was a great story and in my own life, with being divorced with two girls, I watched the pain on their face also.  In the end, it now worked out better all the way around.  I never say anything bad of their dad and I tell them it is not their fault.  They are enjoying time with him now.  I know they love me also and I do feel he does the same.  Letting them know I love them and it is not their fault.  I spent time in my own garden when I was married so this story is great.  I wouldn't change any of it.  I think she did the perfect job writing this essay and she just kept grabbing my attention with everything that I've written.  She makes great points of her garden and the divorce.
