I always saw him as this geek kind of person.  He always wore cargo pants and never jeans, and either game, anime or rock tshirts.    Anyway, we've been talking and joking around about things and he's a nice guy.  He actually has a sense of humor.  From first glance he looks very serious.  One shouldn't judge by looks alone, but everyone says he appears to be that type. Upon getting a better look at the guy, he's not bad looking at all.  In fact clean him up a little and he'd be hot!  In the past 3 days I've been thinking about him a lot.  A lot more than one should; him being someone that I have just become friends with.
