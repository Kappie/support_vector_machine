Nobody cares about the characters in the play, its limited to what they do. Actions that inform us about the innumerable possibilities we can indulge into. Its such a great thing! an understanding that produces the best learning curve.  We all do it. Some teach and learn within closed doors and some out in the field. Whatever the location might be, make sure that there aren't any glass houses and no stones around.
