Collen and I really need this and to be able to spend time w/ Jen will be cool too.  It will be Collen, me, Jen, Jim, Jens dad and her little brother Mike.  Her dad already volunteered to watch the kids at night so Jim, her and I can hang. Talk about a perfect vacation.  I am glad we will get to hit all the Disney parks and water parks and we are going to Universal for 1 day.  We have a full schedule. Can't wait. I am gonna relax and have a good time and not worry about my disease, work, fucked up people in my life that I give way to much credit to or any other stupid shit! I need a new digital camera though.  The one I had got stolen.  I will go crazy w/ out being able to check my email that week.  OMG My day won't be complete not being able to email stupid crap back and forth all day to John and Paul. Having those 2 in my life is really a blessing. I feel that finding that add and actually replying to it has changed my life in a way. Those 2 are becoming very good friends of mine and I am grateful for them both. EVEN WHEN THEY GIVE ME SHIT! Enough for now, need to continue job searching.
