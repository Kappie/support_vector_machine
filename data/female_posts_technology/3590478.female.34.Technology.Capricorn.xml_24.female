The middle lane is for turning left, the far right lane is for turning right, leaving the other lane for those of us who are not  crack smoking, geriatric, narcoleptics. (For those of you in Scotland, please disregard the traffic question and enjoy a 20 year old photo of Jackie and I.) I've recently given up on the interstate as a viable option for driving to work as it's become a parking lot. And it isn't as if I'm stressed about being late to work (If I'm on time for anything it's either that someone else is in charge, there was a wacky mix up in the daylight savings time thing or it's a lucky break), it's just that I like to drive places faster than  14 miles per hour !  What part of fast lane equals sleepy time in this country?! It's supposed to get cold again tonight. 44 degrees cold. ew! It's almost May, what is going on? I thought I was done with the putting on of the pants until winter. Stupid cold.   I recently read an article in a British magazine that said both Charisma Carpenter (Cordelia) and Sarah Gellar (Buffy) were up for the role of wonder woman in the movie. What was funny was at the end the writer suggested the way to decide who got the role was to have them partake in nude lime jello wrestling. (teehee, the Brits rock!)   I don't have enough tee shirts for all the great one liners. Guess I'll have to start putting them across the back of my underwear. (and by start I'm implying I haven't been doing this already.) 10 more.  10) It’s all fun and games until someone loses a tooth. Then it’s hockey. 09) The only normal people are the ones you don't know very well. 08) We have enough youth- How about a fountain of smart? 07) Organized people are just too lazy to look for things. 06) Age and treachery will triumph over youth and skill. 05) Not now. I’m working the room. 04) Am I getting smart with you? How would you know? 03) Prepare to bow before my invincible irony and sarcasm. 02) The meaning of life? You’re looking at it.  01) I appeal to a small, select group of confused people.   Somebody told me they enjoyed last weeks' movie reviews but they were disappointed because the specific movie(s) weren't mentioned. This week, personal attacks! Different reviewer, same level of surly and surlier. Piffle, Valerie Krustyburger manager: "We need more secret sauce. Put this mayonnaise in the sun."  Marge: "Homer, is this how you pictured married life?"  Homer: "Yeah, pretty much, except we drove around in a van solving mysteries."  -The Simpsons
