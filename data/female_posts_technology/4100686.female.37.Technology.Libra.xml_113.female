Why are we so easily persuaded that deadlines are tight and that change can proceed only when accompanied by weapons or mindless slogan repetition?   Time is never short and we have all the hindsight we need, centuries of it. Change can proceed without weapons and without mindless slogan shouting. Change can proceed with careful consideration, and will be stronger and more stable for it. There is usually an approximate ten year period that follows political upheaval. This is the formative period. What forms during this time can be changed also, but is less likely to.
