I thought I would have to leave because I just couldn't get the hang of how to adjust the bike for my short frame.  I sat either too high, or the handle bars were too far away.  Too complex for my simple mind.  Anyway, this girl next to me took pity and helped me adjust my bike. I sat front row and center. I am a good student--actually I just forgot to wear my contacts.  Pam was our instructor.  She had tight everything.  Tight butt, tight muscles, toned everywhere.  She's about 30 years my senior.  How impressive.  The girl who helped me adjust my bike turned to me before it all started and noticed I didn't have a bottle of water.    "It's about an hour long, you're gonna need a bottle."  Me: "I didn't know that.  It's my first time."  Helpful girl: "Oh. Well, if you get tired you can always leave."   I lasted the whole hour .  And by the end of it, I was praying Pam would stop.  She definitely took me past the leisurely bike ride I'm used to.  Now my butt cheeks hurt.  Ouch.  My quads as well....I'm coming back for more torture/fun next Saturday.
