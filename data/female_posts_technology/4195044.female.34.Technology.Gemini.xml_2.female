He’s eccentric; he is fond of altering defined subjects that he fancies on.  The   urlLink Consumentenbond   (Consumer organization) have rated them as the #1 supermarket with the cheapest prices in the whole of NL. The low-cost German   urlLink ALDI   and   urlLink LIDL   ranked next.  Its just 10 minutes bike ride from where we live, which makes it very convenient for us. I kind of liked it since it gives my legs the needed exercise for the weekend. I have a  fiets tas  (bike bag) that hangs at the back of my bike. Sister in law gave this to me, very useful when we go shopping.       WAIT...... did I just say we shop with our bikes?  WHY  the heck are you shocked? Hehe - I myself still can't get over the idea. It's kind of kiddy-stuff. Well that was how I see it before, I thought biking is akin to playing.... but not here in NL!         If you don't have a bike ,  then you don’t live in NL  . That simple! Later I will edit this entry and post a foto of a Dutch going shopping with this ubiquitous bike.      Studies here show that a Dutch person has on average 2 bikes.  The 1st bike is a “ beat down bike ”, for practical reasons against bike-napping, the country’s # 1 crime. These bikes are the ones you artfully evade when crossing the streets in the Centrum. The nice thing is... you actually hear the rickety subjects from a distance. They make their arrival known so that gives you ample time to jump to the gutter!  The 2nd bike, a “ nice good priced bike ”, for personal enjoyment… and must by all means never be detached from the owner. Alright I am exaggerating! If you choose to let’s say leave it somewhere, then do NOT, I repeat do NOT forget to padlock the poor thing twice, some in fact do it thrice! Talk about being SIGURISTA! And a reminder, you are stupid if you leave it in a non-paid  fietsen stallen  (bike parking)! Consider yourself warned.  Great, I have finished my bike rant and now I will go shopping :-)   HP/Microsoft Update : The Laptop is again working  OK  but in a recuperating mode. I simply am puzzled in limbo, why a "Brand New Laptop" is doing pantomime acts on me. Dutchman says it will just get worse. I trust his judgment, he is the Techie. I am already sold out to just re-install everything, start fresh, start new…. even if Dutchman is gnawed. Yes, he is totally over-harassed with this freaking machine, and it’s him who will do the dirty and tedious job of re-installation, not me. Oh well…  vervelend .
