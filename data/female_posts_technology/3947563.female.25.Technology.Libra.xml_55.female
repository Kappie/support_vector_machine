My upper body is killing me as well, but I don't walk on my arms....but maybe I'll start considering it. It's a good feeling though, knowing that I'm sore from my lunch time work outs. I took a break today. Decided to treat myself to some sushi and miso soup. I'll be back at the gym during lunch tomorrow though. They are really working for me. It gives me an excuse to leave the office and gives me more energy for the rest of the day.  So food for today:  Breakfast: Multigrain bagel Lunch: Sushi, and miso soup Dinner: Small pizza with wild mushrooms and tomatoes, but had to have the choloate cake for dessert.  Went to Wolf Gang Puck's accross the street.  Not bad - but a little expensive.  Excersise: NONE!
