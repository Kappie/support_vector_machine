I used to hear about the name manas as a child , when granny used to refer to Grandpa's statements that he would go to manas and stay there.  Then, I later read that it is a lake situated high in Himalayas and going there is a great thing.  Well, legend has it that Lord Shiva and Parvati descend there from Kailash, whose peak is reflected in the waters of Manas, and that lord dances to his pleasure there. It i also said that all the divine people come there for their bath and the bottom of the lake leads to another world. For some reason, the sand that is besidethe lake is in grey color, giving an evidence to the saying that Lord Shiva dances there. There is also a popular belief that if items or snaps of people who reached the abode of Almighty are left in the lake and if they travel towards Kailash, then, they have gained a place at his feet.  My Aunt, Dad's youngest Sister made a trip to Manas in 1997. It was then tht I came to know about the place. I waited for her return and Learnt a lot about that place.  Now after 7 years, its turn of Dad's second ounger brother to visit the place.  I am planning to present a series of blogs here with urls to snaps of Kailash and Manassarovar. Many things to share....
