My feet seem to be itching to walk untravelled streets, with foreign street signs, and it taps taps taps impatiently when settling idly under the work desk, the computer desk at home.  My feet want to travel.  I want to travel.  I'm looking at my favorite site for travel deals  urlLink OffPeakTraveler.com  and looking lustily at the deals they're tempting me with. The best thing is that of the 3 countries I want to visit, Spain, England, France, we have relatives we can stay with to offset the cost of hotel rooms. Although I have been thinking it would be nice to have our own hotel room, the relatives with open rooms make the travel more feasible.  Sigh. I really have the wander lust.
