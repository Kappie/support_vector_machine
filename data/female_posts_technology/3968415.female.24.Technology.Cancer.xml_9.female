Fri  23/7/20041900hrs: Rushed off from work to meet the rest at Kranji MRT at 745 pm.   23/7/2004 1915hrs: On the train. Got an SMS that the buswill be late. Will arrive at 2045hrs! Oh man!! What am i going to do for 1 hr!?!   23/7/2004 1945hrs: Arrived at Kranji. Called Keng Wah. He was sitting on some stairway, reading the manual for the test. The test! Sudden realization that i havent read the manual or watched the VCD. Okay, so i am going to fail the theory test.  And hmtan forgot his divelog/ card and all. Turned back from Bishan MRT to home. Lucky bugger. Spared from the long wait.   23/7/2004 2045hrs: Finally! Bus came. Hmtan nowhere in sight. Went onto the bus, waited.   23/7/2004 2050hrs: Arrival of Mr HMTAN. Off to the Check point.   23/7/2004 2120hrs: Cleared immigration. On our way to "pitstop" Projet !?? Question: What / Where is Projet?   23/7/2004 2200hrs: Answer: An upclass kiosk, selling all sorts of tidbits, munch, hot food, drinks and all in the middle of some highway to Mersing. Had the most sumptous dry cupa-noodle~ Maggie Mee Goreng. Havent had something like that ina long time!! Happy food.   23/7/2004 2215hrs: Fat/Fed and Satisfied. Driver sped on, to Mersing.   SAT  24/7/2004 0020hrs: Woke up to find out i was in Mersing and a sharp pain of the right side of my head. Think the rocking motion of the bus + digestion of the 30g of carbs and fats put me off to sound sleep. Headache must have been from the constant knocking against the window. Lugged all our bags up to our room. Washed up and more zzzzzzzzzzzzz..   24/7/2004 0645hrs: Wakey wakey. And makan! the hotel breakfast was not too bad.. YUMMOS.   24/7/2004 0715hrs:Onto the hotel bus to Mersing jetty.   24/7/2004 0717hrs: Got off the bus. Lugged the bags. Oh! The heavy diving equipment!!To the jetty.   24/7/2004 0718hrs: WHERE IS MY HANDBAG?! MY PASSPORT!! MY WALLET!! MY IDENTIFICATION! Must have left it on the HOTEL BUS!! OH NO!! ARGH!! Must missed that bag out in all the the hussle!!   24/7/2004 0725hrs: Hotel bus returns with my handbag. *sheepish grin* Hanging on to my handbagwith my DEAR LIFE!   24/7/2004 0745hrs: Right in front of the queue. BUT! Boat came. Boat left. It is never our turn."What??!! Not again?! This is the 3rd boat that is not OURS?!"   24/7/2004 0800hrs: Finally. On the speed boat. "Human-chained" the bags onto the boat! OH THE HEAVY BAGS!!   24/7/2004 0805hrs: The speed boat took off. "HFRRrrrrmmmm.....HHHHRRRRMmmm!" Realised that most of the windows are closed. Thought it will be nice to have some wind in my hair. Opened the window. Indeed, the wind was refreshing! And so was the splash that came along with it! Ok.. maybe that was why they closed the window. Followed likewise. Stuffy enclosure.   24/7/2004 0810hrs: Took my text, Attempted to read.   24/7/2004 0815hrs: Closed the text. It was impossible. Getting DROWSY. I am beginning to thinkmoving vehicle will almost 100% equate to sleep   24/7/2004 0915hrs: Engine ceased. The silence was deafening! And the boat was rocking!  Have we arrived..?! Doesnt seem like it. MyDive Master was sitting still.Some villagers were trying to get off. Our boat was parked alongside another boat that was along the the jetty.   Another boat came next to us. An Ang Moh familywere trying to get on. It is hilarious to see these Ang Mohs wrapped up in black trash bags to keep themselves dry. THE TRASH BAG FAMILY! *hahah*   Heard some commotion. Apparently, the villagers threw their bags on board the boat next to the jetty to get on. However, that boat hadpulled off and were leaving with them. Oh man! For the next 15-20 mins, the boat men were simply screaming at each other to figure out how to park their boats so as to 1. retrieve the bags 2. to let the villagers onto the jetty 3. to let the RUBBISH BAG family on 4. to let the boat with the bags out. Note that the sea was really choppy and our speedboat rocked in crazy manner. I was turning GREEN. I felt my stomach churned.   24/7/2004 0930hrs: We managed to get out of it. The engine started and sped off. *STOMACH churning*   24/7/2004 0940hrs: Another jetty. Is it our turn yet? Nah.. *STOMACH churning harder*   24/7/2004 0950hrs: Yet another jetty. Is it our turn yet? Nah... *STOMACH churning. Think concrete mixer*   24/7/2004 1000hrs: YES!! we are at SALANG!! HUMAN CHAINED the bags off the boat. Stepped foot onto SALANG. Breathe hard. Caught a glimpse of the village. It was not the resort i imagined. But what the heck! the only thought right now is to "RELEASE"!!   Dashed to the toilet!  *AAaaaaaaahhhhhh* Relief from the release.    I MADE IT TO TIOMANALIVE!
