I've got tonnes of NEW happenings around me since i last updated this site! To summarize, here's a list of the NEW, wonderful, most memorable things that happened in such a short time frame up till today:-  1.  4 days trip to Salang, Tioman with Nabilah - a whole NEW adventure by itself! 2.  Road Tax  Insurance renewal - got myself a NEW Insurance Company. 3.  Primary school reunion at DU!! My goshh... 14 years we haven't seen each other!! 4.  My brother's wedding...Got a NEW member in the family - a lovely sister in-law! 5.  My Project Implementation Track 2A went LIVE - New SAP system for the live companies! 6.  A Go-Live celebration at A'Famosa, Melaka for the project team!! 7.  13 days trip to Sabah for system support - Unbelievably FUNTASTIC! 8.  A NEW project implementation Track 2 - same system but a new team, new users. 9.  My Car temperature rose!! New important stuff to take note of, ALWAYS! 10. My grandma admitted to hospital for 5 days...   Seriously, looking at this list, i'm surprised i can even find time to digest everything in one go!   Trip to Tioman left me with bitter sweet memories... I managed to do my Intro Scuba Dive, got to catch up with Nabilah, got to a new theory "that one must differentiate between LUST and "CASE" and that a person who talks bad about others might NEVER realize that he himself is the WORST being itself"... and the existing theory: "If you are a wonderful person, you will bound to meet and attract more wonderful people" is SO TRUE!  Road Tax  Insurance renewal... doing it all by myself wihtout troubling my dad has added more boost to my sense of independence. Many thanx to my aunt  uncle for guiding me on handling this yearly chore. Now i'm left to properly organize my important documents, piling up fast on my study desk in the room...  Primary School Reunion... was just AWESOME!! It was just exciting and overwhelming to meet up with old classmates that i havent seen in YEARS!! Turns out the gurls are looking more and more babelicious compared to the men....why am i not surprised..hahaha! Met my first ever ex-best friend, Zanne... cant believe some things never change. I had the courage to chat up with an old crush, finally...tho he dont seem that impressive no more...must have been out of my mind to have had a crush on him 14 years ago...kids!!  Brother's Wedding day!  A memorable day indeed... i hope they live hapily ever after.  Hahh.. this is tiring.. i'll just summ up everything else lah since there's just too much to write with so little time and patience on my side. As my project went live on 12th April, everything was fun fun fun for a month! The celebration in Melaka was outtathisworld, stayed in bungalow with the AJKs, cowboy line dancing, paintball combat and karaoke, wic i never knew i had the guts to do..with my ED too!! Then the trip to Sabah... sighh.. i'll dedicate a column just for Sabah tomorrow...one word, AMAZING.  So right up to now, i'm a concentrating on my new project Track 2 and so far it's just time consuming. Not that i mind, it's even greater after the wonderful changes that came after the Sabah trip...i've got myself a NEW distraction... :)  And here's to the NEW ME: as of today, I QUIT SMOKING...looking forward to healthier lifestyle... CHEERS!
