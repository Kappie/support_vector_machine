Last night, instead of reading all of the prep materials my co-workers generously lent me, I did yoga with Green Marble. Poise, people, POISE! said the creepy man on the TV as I fell out of balance over and over again. Despite not getting the yoga thing right, my posture feels strangely better today. Although it does not increase my knowledge of the California planning process. Attempts to read about it on the bus this morning led to a nice nap. Hopefully the director will take notice of the fact that I brushed my hair this morning and removed lint from my sweater. I hope the interview happens today - I don't think I can keep this up.
