Clutter is like fighting weeds, a person has to weed out the ones that don't fit or look good.   I really liked how in his essay he gave numerous examples. It didn't really keep my attention the whole time; in the beginning I was really interested, but towards the end I lost that intrest. I think he was throwing a lot of information into this essay, it was almost overwhelming how he jumped around so much. But all together it was a pretty good essay that pointed out different aspects of cluttering.
