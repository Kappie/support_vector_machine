We're not planning on jumping into having a baby soon but it's been on my mind, and it will happen eventually.  Last night, after work, I managed to drag myself to Walmart, eyes droopy, cranky from the long day.  It was 8:30 pm by the time I got out, and I could hardly muster a smile for the cashier.  When I got home, I put away the groceries and plopped down on the couch, tired. I was tired and I hadn't done anything too taxing.  I had gone to work, did groceries, and I was tired.  If I had children, I would have had to pick them from daycare most likely, feed them, give them baths, entertain them, put them to sleep. I asked myself, how would I have the energy to do all that?  I pushed the disturbing thoughts away, and turned on the computer and spent the next hour and a half scanning pictures and printing them out by trial and error.  While the pictures printed I finished a book.     My husband came home.  We went to bed shortly.  Then in the dark I told him about my fears.    All my life I have never had to take care of anybody.  I've been taken care of by my parents, and now all my husband and I think about is us.  Our desires, our dreams, our plans, our trips.  I cook when I feel like it.  Woody, cooks when he feels like it.  We're not weighed down by demands.  I've no concerns but me. And my husband.  But he's an adult, and in many ways more mature than me.  He takes care of me.  I feel too selfish to be a mother. How would I have time to workout, and mess with the computer, read my books, take trips, have alone time with my husband?    Woody's response was: "let's not have kids"  I groaned.  That is NOT a solution!  But I have nothing but admiration for mothers.  For mine, for every mother who puts their children first.
