My original intention was to record the *new* blogs of people just beginning to exercise their opinions internationally.    Not quite sure what my decision is on this yet. Maybe, if i find more journalists blogs i will begin another heading for them ~ as with  Some Soldiers Blogs .  At the moment i'm only tallying the blogs in the  Iraq Blogs  links.
