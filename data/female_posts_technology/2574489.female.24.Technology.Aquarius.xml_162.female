Maybe its because I hate labels, maybe its because for some reason, I associate "feminists" with negative connotations or with bra-burning, picket lining, butches...no offense to anyone.  Recently however I was speaking with a colleague about how much I loved Hermione's character from the Harry Potter books, and how she is the true hero of the books as opposed to Harry Potter. We went back and forth, me pointing out that she is the one who always comes up with answers and tactics in resolving their gang's problems. Finally, not seeing eye to eye, I ended it by saying, "Well, I still favor Hermione." To which my friend replied, "well that's because you're a feminist."  I paused and reflected. Is this true? i asked myself. And after some recollections, the evidenced piled up. I guess I am!  First, in my marriage, I am no cooking, ironing, cleaning, Martha Stewart home-maker.  Much as I admire those wives who are, I scoff when hubby even hints that these are things I "should be doing". I don't think so. I'll cook my turn, you cook yours. I usually clean because hubby has allergies that flare up when dusting, spraying cleaners etc., but I don't care about house decorations. I iron only when really needed. In fact, hubby cooks better than me, so I usually "let him" cook more often. Ha!  Second, I hate girly-girls. Girls who are always "pa-cute", or can't live without men, always agonizing about their next boyfriends. I prefer girls with personality and attitude. For example, I gag over Lana Lang's always-smiling (simpering) character in Smallville and prefer Chloe who has more substance.  I love, love, love Buffy and any girl who can kick ass!  I am overly sensitive and cynical towards our patriarchal society and bristle at hints of subservience from women or sexism and biases against women.  I guess I was lucky to be raised around and by a group of strong women. Both grandmothers, my mom, and aunts. They all possess(ed) strong personalities and most of the time, were the bosses of their household. :)  But I still don't know if I can really be called a feminist.
