So here I sit, Sunday afternoon at UM, sipping my mocha and catching up on my blog reading.    Went to a Griffins game last night.  That was interesting, certainly different than watching on TV.  I can understand why people like to go and see the games in person, its a different experience.  Personally I found the crowd as entertaining as the game.  Oh, and we won, 2-1 in overtime.  Yesterday afternoon I went with a couple of friends to the Mud Room.  I painted a platter and small bowl (for dip or something).  That was fun, we hadn't been there in awhile.  Now I want to go again :)
