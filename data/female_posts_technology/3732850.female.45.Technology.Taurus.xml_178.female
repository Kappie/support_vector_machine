I want to plant them in my world and tenderly care for them, helping them to grow healthy and strong. I want to build a fence around them and protect them from the harsh elements of life." Having three children of my own, I understand how Deb Sullivan wants to protect her twin nephews. This is what I want for my children, to protect them. Deb Sullivan quotes, "Their parents, my brother and his wife of fourteen years, divorced. Certainly not a new phenomenon, but I had no idea the change and tremendous pain that divorce can bring." Myself, having been married ten years with two beautiful girls found I had not prepared for this terrible feeling of being depressed. I fell into a deep slump and could not understand how my soon-to-be exhusband did not even put up a fight for these two children. Little did I know there was someone else involved or I was in denial with him being involved with someone twelve years younger than him. I was divorced within two months! Talk about a fast divorce. I wrapped alot of myself worth in my husband so my depression was deep, to the point of suicidal thoughts. I had an onion on the counter when the girls would walk in and see my cry. I would tell them it is the onion making tears in my eyes. This was in my apartment that I moved into that I could not stand living in. I joined a B.E. group. This is Beginning Experience for divorced, widowed and separated. This group helped me tremendously. I had no sense of direction when I got divorced. Where do I go now? What direction is my life heading in? What a Change! I no longer could work due to my depression. I had a hard time socializing and tryed various medications that did not work. I ended up in the hospital for taking Prozac that totally went against me. My thyroid was off and my blood pressure went up. I was seeing snakes and just was not a good thing. I moved out of the apartment and bought a trailer house that made me feel better because I actually got more rest and was able to do part-time work with hallmark cards in the Ben Franklin and Pamida store in Roseau, Mn. Later, I added another part-time job doing jewelry. This was in the fall and I started going to Al-Anon meetings that helped me a lot. After one year, I decided to move back close to my hometown which is Gonvick, Mn. I live four miles from there in a town called, Clearbrook, MN. Little did I know, I would be adding a new member to my family. A little boy, born in May of two-thousand one. What a surprise to my life he was. I love him dearly and he is now three years old. My house is small for the four of us but we manage to make it work for us. I have done a lot of painting and rearranging to make for a cozy home. This is where I feel I am doing something for my family. I am back in school and not isolating myself from society. I am once again trying to venture out into this world to make something of myself, not just for me but for my children. This is where all my hard work lies. Within my kids. They are my reason for life, for living, for being here. At one time in my life, for quite a while I did not know that this is what held me together. They're my pride and joy and I would do anything to give them the world. I do the best to give them what I can and that is the best I can do. Deb Sullivan, in her essay connects this with planting in the garden and relating it to life with nurturing and caring for her garden in the way she does the same for her twin nephews by praying for the seeds of love to flourish in their life. I hope this works for my children too. I pray everynight for God to watch over them and keep them safe, especially when they are not in my care when they go with their Dad's and I have no control but to put them in Gods' tender loving care. I don't like being apart from my children but with divorce, there is no choice. What is going to happen will and I hope that they always come home safe.
