I actually saw them a while ago at a show I never posted for. They opened for Stellastarr*. Here's a nutshell post, because I feel guilty:  The Evening/The Killers/Stellastarr* @ GAMH 04-29-04   The Evening: local band. rilly good.   The Killers: they stink. they have a great song on the radio now, something about girlfriends and boyfriends. that song, stellar, the rest, stinky. i almost fell asleep even though i was up at the front. i had to leave to buy myself a coke. You will like The Killers if you like anything that sounds like The Strokes. I don't. I'm too old and ornery to be entertained by lifeless knockoffs.  Stellastarr*: good. great album. good show. singer: gorgeous. drummer: had a big asterisk taped over his nipple. something that irked me though (as I'm easily irked) is the girl-harmonies. she never sings any words, she just goes "ohhhhhhhh" or "uh-ohhhh" or "ahhhhh". R-guy joked that she must be foreign.
