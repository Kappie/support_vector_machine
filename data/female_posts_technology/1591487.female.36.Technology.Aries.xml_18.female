I think I'm getting the 'old woman' syndrome of becoming Mrs Tactless, of thinking that honesty is the best policy, when, of course, I'm old enough and stupid enough to know better.  Again, another blog about work, so tedious, but sorry, I feel the need to be slightly cathartic, if only to make myself feel better.  Today I was told that I would be 'seconded' to another department for approximately six to eight weeks,  'secondment' is another word for being unceremoniously shifted around like a pawn to satisfy some ridiculous concept of 'sfaff management'.    After initially feeling freaked out by the idea - being Mrs Routine, any implication of change sends me round the bend - I eventually felt slightly better after chatting with one of the nice people I will be working with.  As she has gone through a similar process, we both laughed and agreed that yes, we were our respective departments sacrificial lambs being sent to slaughter in order to save the status quo of others in our departments. Anyhoo, dull, dull, dull.  However, after revealing the change to my immediate monkey-boy colleagues it was mentioned as to the reasons why I might have been nominated for the change, and that the reasons were of noble intent to help me out career-wise etc etc, however, I blurted out that I thought I was being used as a pawn, that I can't help but being cynical, that this shift was to save someone else's arse etc etc.  Remember when I said 'brain>mouth editor' needed to be engaged? Well, apparently that didn't seem to be working about half an hour ago.   I really should have just stayed quiet and nodded demurely like a lady.    Why wasn't I sent to finishing school in Switzerland?  It would have saved me a lot of grief.
