It'll be good to see my little cousins who aren't so little anymore.  We're doing an egg hunt tomorrow.  And B is coming down tomorrow too.  I got him an Easter card.  Is that strange?  I know he doesn't read this so I don't think I'm giving away any surprises.  B's not really up with the online world.  He's hardly ever on IM.  Quel dommage!  Here's another quote that I like: "Anyone can become angry - that is easy.  But to be angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, and in the right way - this is not easy." -Aristotle, The Nicomachean Ethics
