People are scaring me with their hollowed cheeks and crazed stares and incessant mindless chatter about carb-counting. Yesterday I bought a bag of Atkins-brand bagels because the zombies are getting to me. I made a bagel sandwich this morning and it was like eating air. It was a fucking SANDWICH at 7am and now it's 10 and I'm fuckin looking wildly around for something else to eat. (Chris Farley whine:) I'm STARVING! Diets/Food restriction suck(s) because you're hungry all the time! That's why fat people are interesting to talk to--their stomachs are full and thus energy circulates in their craniums instead of wallowing in their deprived empty stomachs. (Caveman grunt:) Thinking, GOOD; Starving, BAD.  What do carbs taste like? How does their absence affect my eating pleasure? For instance low-sodium=bland, lowfat=dry, and "diet"=weird chemically-sweet aspartame/ nutrasweet taste and aftertaste. For now, my assessment is that carbs=substance and so, cutting carbs is like wasteful eating. There's no point since you're still going to be hungry!!! And hungry=angry!!!
