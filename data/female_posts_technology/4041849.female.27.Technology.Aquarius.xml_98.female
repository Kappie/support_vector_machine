"we wants it! and the nasty little hobbitses took the precious!"      but, i have some beef with the movie... i know it's just a movie and all but...    1. if her family and matt's family live next door to each other in new jersey all their lives... WHERE'S the NJ accent???    2. (this is actually a funny comment from steve) what white taxi driver is not gonna know rick springfield from springsteen?   3. and my comment was: what guy from    NJ    is going to confuse rick springfield with THE BOSS? good god! jersey LOVES springsteen! hehe...   4. so, in order for a woman to be completely happy, she shouldn't be a successful mag editor.. instead, she should get married to her childhood sweetheart and move into a friggin' pink barbie dreamhouse? what, she couldn't have it both ways? sheesh... in order to be nice, you have to be conventional? in order to be happy you can't be a high-powered executive? (although, in my company, you can't be woman and nice and powerful... but that's a whole other rant... i don't know how it is in other corps...)   5. if matt's an artsy photographer living in the village, he is NOT moving into the damn 'burbs into a friggin' pink barbie dreamhouse... if he marries her and they're all nice and happy together, he wouldn't turn into the quirky artist type he became... he's going to wake up and ask, is this my beautiful house? is this my beautiful wife? and he'll realized that he missed out on life.    6. and finally, you know part of the reason why she decided on getting together with matt in the end was cuz he ended up being a sensitive hottie, as opposed to the blond idiotboy she WAS seeing.      who knew i would get so heated about a movie geared to 13 year olds????    okay, but despite my cynicysm, it really was pretty enjoyable. a lot better than i thought it would be. also, when i first saw mark ruffalo, i didn't think he was that cute, but he sure got a lot better looking as the movie went on...
