Weather bug, you promised me a mild weather, you putz.   -I started a food diary...only a 1 day entry and it is glaringly obvious that I have some changes to make.  I went to school last night even though it was pouring, and then went to work out afterward. Hubby is so proud of me.    -I love that it's hump day. I am itching to get my hands on some Beyonce, Missy Elliott and Tamia tickets.  Concert's at American Airlines Center on March 15 and Rhy is treating me.   -I also checked our bank account and still no refund. What's up with that? I think I'm just being impatient.  They did say 10 days, and that doesn't come until Friday/next Monday, depending on what day my accountant starts/ends counting.
