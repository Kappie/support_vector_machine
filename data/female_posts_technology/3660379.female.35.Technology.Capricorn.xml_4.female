Last year I was to participate in this event, but if you remember, just a couple weeks before the event I severely injured my ankle.  Well, my ankle is all healed, and I've been training like crazy.  I'm so excited.. I just can't wait!    If you're interested in the event, you can learn more at the  urlLink Tuxedo Brothers  Website.    The event consists of a 500 Meter Swim, 10 Mile Bike, 3 Mile Run.
