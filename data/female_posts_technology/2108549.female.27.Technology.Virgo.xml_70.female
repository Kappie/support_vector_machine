There is only one blood relative in this family, all the rest have been adopted by me or have adopted me themselves.  And I say adopted not in the legal term but in the term of the heart.    It took me 27 years but I now have a Dad. Oh my biological one is somewhere out there.  Actually last I knew he lives about 30 minutes from me.  But neither he nor I have the desire to be a part of each others lives.  He chose not to be in my life as a dad for the first 16 or 17 years and I have chosen not to be in his life on his terms the last 11.  And that's ok.  I don't think he is a bad person, nor even neccessarily a bad father to my half brother, honestly, I don't know the man.  There are no hard feelings on this end and I wish him the best, however he and I both do better I think out of each other's lives.  I have a new dad though.  One that I met some time ago and he has adopted me into his heart as I have adopted him.  Any comments left by Dad are from him.    I appreciate the concern and care especially from someone I have never met, however, please let me assure you, nothing inappropriate has or will happen on that front.  Thank you for the concern.
