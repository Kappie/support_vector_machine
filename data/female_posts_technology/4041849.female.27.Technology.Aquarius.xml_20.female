(for the record, i don't think stan's beating her or anything. i just think he's very manipulative, controlling, and possessive.)      he should embrace her for who she is and if she wants to change for herself for the better, she should do it. not change into a mindless girl without an opinion for him. he should accept her for who she is. not expect her to change. can you believe she said: i have so many things to change now i can't keep track???? how effed up is that? you know something's wrong with the relationship if someone says that...      iwish her luck. i'm sorry i had to end our 12 year friendship, but he was going to end it anyway... but i guess it doesn't really matter anyway... i don't know her anymore... and it's a shame.       anyway, whatever. steve's taking me to seattle and vancouver the weekend of her wedding. hehe... maybe i'm just lucky to have found a unique and great guy. maybe most boys out there are like stan. scary. maybe i've forgotten since i've been out of the dating loop for a few years now... maybe i'm used to being spoiled by steve? i dunno.      and forthosejudging mewho think that she was there for me while i was with psycho, so i should be there for her at her wedding, i only have this to say: she was there for me before psycho and after psycho. not during. and yes, part of that's my fault because i pushed people away, but that's also because she was always judging me, not understanding why i couldn't get out of that relationship. it's so much more complex than that. i hopeshe's realizing that now... but, i doubt it. i gave her too much credit. she's not that understanding or bright and i'm realizing that now... (so, what does that say about me???)       well, good luck to my friends who are stuck being in that wedding. i'm justrelieved i got out :)
