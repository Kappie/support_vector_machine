Its too bad i can't swim and i live in a landlocked city    am lazy until i set my mind upon doing something. Once I do, I'm usually very focussed    can be a kid at times, and this extremely no-nonsense mature adult when i need to be.    really love being ppl's agony aunt, dishing out philosophy to ppl in general.     and finally.....     have to get back to work now! :)
