He is more tolerable and charming this way and I am my best self. I still find him handsome and sexy but I no longer inquire or care about his feelings towards me and I'm no longer annoyed nor elated by him. I'm redistributing my eggs and I'm deciding whether his one egg will be poached or rotten. I have more though. Here are the baskets that each carry one or more eggs:   Playing music  at Lennon Studios with SJ and J-Wo. The familiar ache and hardening of my fingertips is a great feeling.   Fiddling around in the kitchen.  Yesterday while Green Marble and Scooter ran laps and laps around a track and I watched them from the bleachers, I had a revelation: White Sauce Lasagna. Like an Alfredo Lasagna. I am thinking chicken and ricotta and roasted garlic and sun-dried tomatoes and chestnuts. I told GM  S my great idea and they, being gourmands, said white sauce lasagna has been done and were skeptical of the chestnut idea. They will see. I'm not a genius when it comes to making up recipes, but I am very creative and have great ideas. Though my risk-taking is hit-or-miss. Once when I was a very little kid, I wanted to "be punished" like how kids are on family TV so I announced that I would make dinner for everyone. No one knew what I was talking about cuz I was a little kid and how could I possibly make dinner. My aunt was preparing food in the kitchen so I took a big cup and filled it with scoops of rice, thit kho (salted pork), and vegetables. Then I poured orange juice to the top. When my parents and my brother came home, I said look! I made dinner, then demonstrated how to consume it by taking in mouthfuls of meat, rice, and OJ simultaneously. I thought it was delicious. My brother begged for an alternative. My parents laughed. My family sat down to their conventional dinner while I continued gulping down OJ and pork.   The Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie. This is the novel of novels in my book, er, world. The notoriety, the dense prose, the volume. I am completely intimidated by its formidable reputation. Thus I've convinced LingL and XX to read it with me. They rip through books, so I have a healthy dose of competition to keep my mind on the text at hand. We've formed a book club and it's called " The Kool Kids Book Klub ." There are no perks or rewards but there ARE membership cards which I crafted yesterday. I've made slots for six books to be read together by Kool Kids. Any joiners? The only thing you have to do to join is start reading The Satanic Verses and try to finish it within a reasonable amount of time. Oh, and you have to be kool.   I'm also trying to  exercise  more, but I'm not sporty or outdoorsy at all. When I tagged along with Green Marble and Scooter to the Kezar track, they ran at least 7 laps, and me? I pooped out after 3/4 of one. 3/4 of a lap and totally winded. Plus, I only have my sleepytime sweatpants that lost its drawstring years ago. My pants couldn't stay up! I had to choose between exercise and modesty. It wasn't my total surrender to fatassy-ness and sloth that made me take a seat and dream up white lasagna. It's because I'm a modest Christian. Butt cleavage is the devil's tools, doncha know.
