Of course my competitiveness has kicked in full bore and I want to be the best on the team. ;o)  While the chances are slim of that happening this week, maybe someday it will!  The new apartment is still wonderful, Freedom and I are adjusting pretty well I think to all the new noises.   Life is just well, life right now.  Some good days, some bad days and a whole lot of ok days.
