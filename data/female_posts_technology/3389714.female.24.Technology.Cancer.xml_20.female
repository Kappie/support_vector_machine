G masi woke me up and told me every one was ready..i was dumbfounded ..she knew I had to shower and stuff..that I simply brushed ma teeth and jumped into the car in the morning..this 25th wedding anniversary for my mamma and mammi was starting to become a huge drag…I rushed into the guest bath to shower and stuff …my hair was soaked and the blow-dryer was weak..it was not really doing it’s job…I could hear D kaka screaming downstairs .. I hated it … I didn’t want to go and I was obligated to represent my family..mom and dad totally set me up.. I couldn’t’ take it any more and I started cryin in the bathroom..ma sis was there and she was really something she quickly calmed me down and helped me get dressed..we were out the door..i was totally pissed and felt like crap…I loaded the kids into ma car..and waited in the driveway for someone to pull out so I can follow them..i didn’t want to talk to anyone..i hated the world.. I didn’t want anyone to feel sorry for me but hey cut me some slack…I got 2 hours of sleep the night before ..cuz the coughin wouldn’t stop..and the fever decided to come back…I was drippin wet when we got to the party but I didn’t give a damn…I just wanted it to be over..the party was decent ..but I felt like crap..the speeches were cute..but I kept tunin in and out… I luv ma family but just not that day.. they were being so difficult…y couldn’t they leave me the hell alone..i was so tired..and hurting… was scared to eat anything so I didn’t… g masi got mad at me cuz I wouldn’t eat..i told her I was afraid of throwing up..she said fine…do whatever you want...I hate it when she does that.. decided to slip away to ma car..and called up Doctor P…I was able to get some rest from the loud music and the family..it was good…I hung up after a brief convo with the doctor and headed back to the party just in time to see mama dancing like a total mad man…it was great…soon the party was over and I was back at g masi’s .. drugged myself out with nitequil and fell fast asleep…Sunday..was a mess…b and k masis were over and they were soo damn annoying..got dressed and headed to mama’s and mammi’s I wanted to leave VA by 1:00 but now it was 3:30 and we still at mama’s I was beyond pissed..we finally got out at 4:00 and I made my way to jerzy… once we passed the Delaware Memorial Bridge ..it was over..i never seen traffic so think..this was bloddy insane..and ma bro didn’t help he was so damn annoying during the drive back and ba snoring in the back seat didn’t help…I attempted to tune everyone out and made it home by 9:20 mom and dad were missing in action so I dropped ba off at ma place and went out for pizza…S masi was with us and we ended up at her house watching matchstick men..good movie…came home went to bed… woke up and now I’m at work…now bloody leave me alone…ahhhh….  Question of the Day:  Why won’t anyone make out with me?….I mean it’s just a stupid cold…please someone join me….in my misery?..Please …I hate being lonely….
