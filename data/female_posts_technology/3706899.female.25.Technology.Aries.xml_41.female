This may seem like a long list, but when it comes to knitting projects I'm very ADD. And I never know what I'm going to feel like working on, so even when I head to campus I pack two or three different projects. So this list may change between now and the 24th. Especially if I manage to scam some yarn from my mom tomorrow ;-)
