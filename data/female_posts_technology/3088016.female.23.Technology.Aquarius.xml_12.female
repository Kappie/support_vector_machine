The caption says that their Sunday Afternoon Lunch Bunch met at Pizza Hut and was given slabs of paper and four Crayons.  The parachuting cows and ketchup explosions are the results of what they came up with, and they're now published on the internet.   Wayne and I can personally relate to this one.  We often dine at the Macaroni Grill near his house, where the server writes his/her name in Crayon on butcher paper on the table and leaves the rest for us to play with.  We have drawn pictures of ourselves on our bikes, trees, clouds, the usual.  Once we drew an amusing picture of the guys at the table next to us.  I guess that seeing these published on the net is proof that we're not the only ones who haven't grown up yet.
