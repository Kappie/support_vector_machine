That and I was having indigestion from all that crap I shoved in my tummy. I felt really cooped up because of the weather and I spent the entire weekend inside. I did get free preview passes for the new movie " urlLink Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets " - not bad but LOOOOONNNNGGGG! clockin in at nearly 3 hours. My ass started to hurt at the 2 hour mark. But then I've read the book - not bad for a kids book. quick easy afternoon/beach read. it [the movie] does some justice to the text, but the book was relatively detailed to begin with - a little short of character development since that was for the most part covered in the first book. All the same it does make me want to read the next book in the series...if only because I'm going to be airborne myself today.   That was one of those dreams that I had when I was a kid - to be a witch or have majical powers and have the ability to make others do my willing - or rather have the natural world under my control....hmmm  Shazam!!
