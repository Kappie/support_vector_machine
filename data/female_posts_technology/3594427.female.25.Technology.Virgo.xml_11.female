It's one of those days when I ask myself, "Dear Lord, why did you make so ambitious, that I actually took this job?"  When people found out I was going to work for this guy, they were all amazed at my courage. It could also be that they thought I was that stupid to get out of my comfort zone and risk everything for someone who has a really bad reputation. Anyway, despite all the warnings I got, I went ahead with this decision.   I have absolutely nothing in common with this guy. He's a hard-core sales man who thinks only in terms of numbers while I am a practical person who has interests outside of my job. I read books, watch movies, appreciate art, etc. This guy claims he is a Buddhist, but he can't even read about the teachings of Buddha unless it's in comic book format! So when we have conference calls or see each other, we just discuss work. Other than that, there is nothing else to talk about.  God knows how much I have changed for my job. I have turned a blind eye to a lot of things that go against my principles. I have learned how to be creative about the truth, gone to a not-so-wholesome KTV, completely turned away from whatever Philosophy taught me about how to treat fellow human beings and given up a normal life with my immediate family. Still, it is not enough. That is what I hate about my life right now. True, I have never been more financially stable, but there is much more to life than money.  I'm going to start saving every single cent I can, so I can get out of this shitty hellhole sooner.  On the bright side, since I have no business trip for next week, then this means I can actually watch Linkin Park here in Singapore. It's confirmed.:) Buying my ticket tonight.
