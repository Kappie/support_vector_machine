How it was storming when we got there, how the rain and snow never completely let up, how our muscles ached by first evening. I was going to describe how amazing food tastes when you're that hungry and physically exhausted, because working in an office I never feel quiet that desperate. How walking six hours a day up and down hiking trails releases chemicals in your brain that make you feel blissful despite of the fact that your clothes are soaked through with rainwater. I was going to say something about how being a part of such a monumental scene makes you feel humble and human. And happy. I was going to tell you that thereâ€™s a bar (!) at the bottom of the canyon and that a Tecate there costs only $3. I was going to tell you how fun it was hanging out with these boys. How I carried my weight and kept up and was probably the only person in the whole canyon wearing lipstick (I do things on my own terms). And how I cooked scrambled eggs and tortilla soup and quesadillas even though I hardly make anything at home. And how we saw mountain goats and California condors and very few other hikers. And that I learned to put up a tent in under a minute. But that would take me the remainder of the day and I have to get back to my piles of work. But I think you get the idea.
