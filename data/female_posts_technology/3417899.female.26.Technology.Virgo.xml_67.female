Now, I am not a native English speaker, and yet, even I know the phrase is "must  have " (not "must of"). I find it deplorable that a magazine will publish an article with such an obvious grammatical error - in the TITLE, no less.  How ironic that the article discusses intelligence, too.  Grammar errors in published media - my pet peeve.
