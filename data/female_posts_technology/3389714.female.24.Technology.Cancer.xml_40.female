I knew I was about to see a fist fight between 2 wrinkled men in an elevator that was no bigger then 5feet by 5 feet… I was in no mood for a battle between the best parcel services… I knew I had to make it up to the 11th floor… then I was in safe haven…the doors slowly opened on the 10th floor and the Fed-Ex guy lifted up his size 36 waist cotton/nylon blend navy blue trouser shorts… to prove to the US Postal Service guy that he wore the pants in that elevator during the ride… I nearly pissed all over myself when the US Postal serviced guy pulled out a pen from his rear left side pocket.. I knew that was going to be the murder weapon used to kill the Fed-Ex guy ..i prayed the elevator door would close… soon enough my prayers were answered by no other then “Hare Krishna”…so now it was just me and the US Postal Service guy ..he smirked at me ..as if he was a vampire waiting upon his last meal before the sun rose.. I wanted to blurt out “you know my mom works for you guys too, luv your uniforms” ..and jet out of the door when they opened…I tried to keep focus on the dial on the top of the elevator doors.. impatiently waiting for the number 11 to appear…soon enough they did and I shot out like a bullet from a semiautomatic AK 47… and made my way through the doors…when a hand grabbed my shoulder ..i nearly screamed with fright… I turned around to see the bright blue eyes of the US Postal service guy…he was raising his hand ..i knew he was going to stab me in the eye with his .25 cent Parker pen… soon enough his hand came into focus and he was holding …yah u got it ..my god damn “SWIPE CARD”…I dropped it on the floor when I was placing my keys in my backpack….. I know I’m such a DUMB*SS…   Here’s a recipe of how to make a kRiS Cocktail that I got from  urlLink http://www.go-quiz.com/cocktail/cocktail.php :    How to make a kRiS:   Ingredients:  5 parts mercy  5 parts silliness  5 parts energy  Method:  Add to a cocktail shaker and mix vigorously.
