Somehow just being told why I shouldn’t do something was not enough for me. I always had an unmanageable desire to stick my fingers in holes. Little holes, big holes, it didn’t matter. One day, all the neighborhood kids were playing tag in our yard. I was hiding on the side of the house behind some bushes and as I sat there waiting to be found, I saw a big pipe laying there. I couldn’t just leave it alone. I had to see if my finger would fit into the end of that pipe. Even though I had been told many times not to stick my fingers in holes, I stuck my finger in the pipe. When I tried to remove my finger from the pipe, it would not budge. I panicked, thinking, “Oh no, my mom is going to kill me for doing something like this again.” I had no choice but to come out from hiding and see if the neighborhood kids could help me out. We tried everything we could think of. From having a few kids grab on and pull, to trying to grease my finger up with cooking oil so that it would slip out of the pipe. Nothing worked. I knew I was going to have to call my mom at work and give her the bad news. I dragged the pipe up the stairs to our second floor apartment and made the dreaded phone call. Somehow, my mom was not surprised. She told me to fill the sink up with water and put a bunch of ice cubes in it so that I could soak my finger, hoping to reduce the swelling so the pipe would come off. I told her, “Mom, you don’t understand. The pipe is about 6 feet long.” She said she would be right there. Before I knew it, there was a police man at our door. Little did I know he was a friend of my mothers? I thought I was in bigger trouble than I had originally imagined. He explained that my mother had called and asked him to see what he could do for me. His only solution was to take a hack saw and cut the pipe shorter so it was more manageable. Still the pipe would not come off. After a trip to the fire department during which there were two fire calls and my finger left on hold in a vice to have the pipe cut off, I still had not learned my lesson.  If I had only been able to just learn about things because someone said so. Life would have been so much easier. I would never have gotten my finger stuck in my Grandfathers hospital bed, or the antique glass bottle that had been in our family for years. Once I was visiting my grandfather in the hospital. As I was standing by his bed, I noticed a little round hole on the corner of the footboard. I stood there playing with the cover that slid over it. The other family members in the room warned me not to stick my finger in that hole. I just had to do it. I just had to see if it would fit. Again, I was stuck. On the way home from visiting my grandfather in the hospital, we stopped at a restaurant to eat dinner. There was a long row of wooden posts that separated the dining area from the entrance of the restaurant. I casually stood by the posts with my family waiting for a table. I stood there and wondered, “I wonder if my head will fit between two of those posts?” I was warned by my mother not to even think about doing something so foolish because I was going to get stuck. I just had to do it. I just had to see if my head would fit between two of those posts. I couldn’t listen to someone who knew what they were talking about. I had to try it out for myself. There I was, in the middle of a busy restaurant, stuck between those two posts. I was left there, all alone, to figure out how I was going to get myself out of this one. My family looked on in amazement unable to understand how I could do something so dumb. Learning from others would certainly have been easier but life certainly wouldn’t have been as exciting. I would never have gotten my name in the paper explaining the whole pipe incident and at the end of the article they wrote, “And JoAnne was free!” If I could only have learned by example!  Looking back on my obsession with sticking my fingers in holes that they didn’t belong in, I realize that maybe I could have learned by example and experience. Maybe after getting my finger stuck in a hole once or twice, which is certainly learning by experience, I should have listened to the advice I got from others that told me, “Don’t do it again!” After years of experience, I have finally learned to suppress the urge not to stick my body parts into holes even though life isn’t nearly as exciting.
