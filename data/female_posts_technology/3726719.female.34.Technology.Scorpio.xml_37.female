I received the following message in reply to one of my blog posts last week:    "Keep your faith in yourself and in humanity. It's not as bad as you think it is. You are the eternal optimist and others reflect and look up to you for this wonderful attribute. Expect big things from yourself and keep on blogging! "    I have called myself a "Pollyanna" for several years now.   With some of the life experiences I have been through, I cannot help appreciating life and all it's wonderful possibilities.  No matter what my situation, there is always something worse.  I have so much to be grateful about.     Reading this message was like getting a great big hug just for being myself!  I couldn't ask for anything better.  So thank you to my anonymous comment poster.  You were my angel last week!
