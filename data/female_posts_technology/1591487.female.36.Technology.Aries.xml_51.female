No, that's not the same.  It's like, totally funnier.  It started with the wearing of two different shoes.   Yes, for a whole day I was wearing two different shoes.  I don't quite know how this happened, well, yes I do.  An early, dark, wintry morning, usual morning rush, lack of  wardrobe organisational skills, three pairs of shoes almost identical in shape and colour.  Gradual onset of dementia.  You do the maths.  What I find most incredible was that this particular day included a visit to the chiropractor, a longish conversation with the guy fixing my car, walking home to pick up alternative car, normal workday dealings with people, not actually noticing differing of shoes until approximately 3pm.  Which says a lot of things really, from 'how excellent that no-one noticed', to 'hang on, why didn't' anyone notice?, to 'Girlfriend, I really need to get some new shoes'.  Although I am glad that I entertained a number of colleagues, including Upstairs Dave who, after being told via Instant Messaging about the differing shoes, instantly descended the stairs to appear by my desk in approximately two seconds to verify the fact.  On the one hand, I'm happy that I'm surrounded by people who don't actually care about matching shoes, but on the other hand makes me feel a little sad about the variety in my wardrobe.  And it's nice to know that people are positive about these things, as another coworker pointed out, 'Well, you don't work with any gay men and they definitely would have noticed'.  Also, I forgot about three people's birthdays. For which I have no excuse, really. It's not as if they're not written down in my diary in big silver letters, or that these people have these birthdays on the same day every year. Well, I do have an excuse, mainly the self-pity thing alluded to earlier.  But I've realised that, ultimately, I'm too busy for self-pity and in fact, apart from ruining my day, really fucks up my timetable.
