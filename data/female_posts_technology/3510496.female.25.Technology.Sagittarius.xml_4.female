The last time I checked on this account of mine, was weeks back before my flight. I was already thinking of abandoning it, as my Yahoo! email account, is the most 'sleeping' one.   Thanks Ad for informing me. And yes, for the record I had 457 emails in my Bulk folder, and 90 in my Inbox. My account would have been jammed if not for the generous, extra space.  Ever since I came back, I've been trying to catch up on my very longtime, and favorite pastime; READING  urlLink   . Ever since I got married, or worse, ever since I shifted in the new abode, I haven't been able to finish a single, decent book. I dropped by WRL, and left that place with more magazines than books.  urlLink     I guess, I have to jumpstart with more light-readings  urlLink   ; flipping and browsing mags helps. I am on my way to finish up the one by Hanif Kureishi, which I had a year back. Something I fancy, I usual repeat-read it.   Apart from reading, I told Ad, I want to be in touch back with poetry too. The fellow chuckled and said, 'The married one, can skip poetry.' Who says only single, unmarried ones pen poems? And what make he thinks I only do lovey-dovey poems. In fact, the one and only poem of mine, that get to be printed in an anthology of poems in US, smells of religion.  Well, all these ramblings about getting back to all hobbies, are simply efforts to distract me from being too addictive in blogging. I admit its downright addict-licious. Well, I only have myself to blame for the inability of self-control.  I should get all these down on a list (as usual) on what I want to do after half of the year 2004 gone:  1. Read (highlight: do not forget those books on my shelves that are totally unread)  2. Write poems, revisit those columns and contribute them  3. Exercise  urlLink   (MUST tell myself every inch input counts, and housework doesn't exactly make you shed a pound)  4. Don't merely compile recipes, MUST try out  5. Take up something terribly NEW, like sewing? Not doing buttons, not mending alterations. I mean serious sewing, like curtains, pants etc.  urlLink     6. Work harder (like we haven't) to give birth to a grandchild for my parents and in-laws  Hmmmmm ... I guess all these will be getting me away from over-blogging. Do you think so? We shall see.  Hurray! Tonight grocery shopping  urlLink   . Time to replenish the almost- empty fridge and cabinet. As expected hubby declined Sheng Siong, and Giant would be it.
