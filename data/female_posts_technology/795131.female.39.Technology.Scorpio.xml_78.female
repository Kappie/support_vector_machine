The big news here in our office today is that the 'activities committee' set up two large book shelves in our break room, to serve as the company lending-library. Today both shelves are STOCKED FULL...of paperback crime novels! Every last one of them is a crime novel. Well apparently at 2:00 we're having an ice-cream social for it anyway, so I'm going.  My boss forwarded my friend's resume to another manager in the company who is also looking for someone, so I still have some hope for that, but he'll have to interview again, and even if he gets it he won't be in my department. Grrrr.
