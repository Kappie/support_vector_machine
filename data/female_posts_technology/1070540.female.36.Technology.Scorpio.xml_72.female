My little one doesnt want to call me mom any more. I cant tell you how that feels, I cant explain to you how crushed my heart feels. I truley feel alone.  There was always a time that when I felt like nobody loves me, BriKellen seemed to always know and show me how much he loves me. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up, the night mare never ends.   I want a baby so bad, one to have that is mine, that her dad wouldnt say bad things about me and I could be the mom and love the baby and play with the baby like I had wanted to do with the others,  Life just sucks.
