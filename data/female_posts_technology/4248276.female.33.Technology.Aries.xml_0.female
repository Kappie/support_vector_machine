Been cutting back on Zofran. Causing serious constipation. Yuck and ouch! I seem to be doing ok with it so maybe m/s is easing up a bit. I sure hope so. Doc. appt. on Friday. Looking forward to that. I got doppler in the mail. No luck finding heartbeat yet. I know it's still early but I hope to be able to find it someday soon.
