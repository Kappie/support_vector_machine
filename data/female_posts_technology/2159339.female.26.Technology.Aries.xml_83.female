As I wrote down my number on an autumn-hued post-it I hoped that he didn't notice my shaking hands. I also was aware of the heat in my cheeks and my inability to form coherent sentences.   Friday, I emailed him demanding his number so I'd know when it was him calling. I also asked what kind of stereo system he had in his truck so maybe I could bring the cool-to-the-earth's-hot-core Kill Bill soundtrack (Um, Abby, can I borrow please?) and he replies with his number and the statement that his vehicle sports an 8-track and to bring my ELO and ABBA. He came down later to say he was kidding and that he has a CD system. My secret plan is to bring my ELO and ABBA cds. This will make him fall in love with me, undoubtedly.   Then my undercover spy friend within the company came down to tell me that XX has a girlfriend. My robot heart sank. But what is weird and bizarre is that whenever I begin to feel downcast and doubtful about my robot love for XX, he does something to dispel the grumpy pangs. He offered me a ride home. And it was wonderful. And he doesn't have a gf. And he's still going to drive me. And we will listen to the Kill Bill soundtrack and live happily ever after. The end.
