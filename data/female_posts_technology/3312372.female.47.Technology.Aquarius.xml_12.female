I named my Blog Simpler Times because sometimes I long for the days before computers,cellphones,video games etc. In the old days it seemed you had so much time to just be. Well these are my thoughts for today. I would love any tips or information in regards to the purpose of Blogs since I'm new to this site. Have a great evening everyone !!!
