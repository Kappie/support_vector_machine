He says that I have been leaving the room when he is in there. I hadn't noticed but I guess I am. He has been study after he gets home every night until he goes to bed. Literally. I think I am trying to let him concentrate. Because I am wiggly all the time. So I must be paranoid. OOPS Emotional, too.
