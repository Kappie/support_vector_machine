But I believe that my son is better off with both his Mom  Dad in the home .... soooo, here we are.  The name of my blog, "I'm Not Here to Do What You Please", is from the title of a song written by  urlLink Teresa Russell , who's CD you need to  urlLink buy .  She is the most awesome female rock guitarist ..... EVER!  If you can't afford it, I will send you one.  Yes, you need it that badly!  I am into golfing and just bought a new set of  urlLink Lady Callaway Gems  .... I love them!  The things I love about golf are being close to nature, the mental challenge, and the workout.  It's not just about chasing the ball around, ladies!  Golf with me and you will also have fun!! Not only that, I will tell you the story about the day I golfed with three drunk guys .....  I also love cats.  I have two and, no, I am not a  urlLink crazy cat lady . When I figure out how to post pictures, you'll see them both.  They are gorgeous and quite finicky.  Seems like the beautiful cats are always a little hoity-toity, and the short-haired strays are real lap kitties.  I like mountain biking and have a nice  urlLink Cannondale . Unfortunately I don't get to do it enough.  Must make more time for that!  I also love motorcycles and will be getting one as soon as my son is off to college.  Sorry all you Harley lovers, but I think that they are TOO LOUD!!!!  YES, I AM SCREAMING OVER YOUR HARLEY ENGINE EVEN AS WE SPEAK!!! PLEASE GET A MUFFLER, OR BETTER YET, A  urlLink HONDA VTX1300S . THANK YOU EVER SO MUCH!!!!!!!!  How can I commune with nature at 500 decibals?  It can't be done.  No Harley for me, thank you :)  I am a  urlLink Network Engineer  and so, of course, I love computers.  After all, I make them behave, for a living :)  More blogging fun to come!!! Stay tuned.
