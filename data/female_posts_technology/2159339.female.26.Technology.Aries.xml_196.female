I want him to be riddled with disease and heartache like I could be and am. How is it so easy for one person to forget and move on so carelessly while the other person is completely devastated?   I still have a photo album of pictures on Ofoto entitled "I love XX." They're all pictures he took of himself to send to me and keep me company while on the road. There was a time when looking at pictures of his face made me feel so happy but now I look at them and want to cry. The solution? I deleted him from my Friendsters. Sure, I operate in utmost passive aggression, but it's the only way I know how. I know it will hurt him because he's superficial. He cares about how many Friendsters he has. And the photos he sent me I thought were private and just for me, but then he put two of them on his profile for everyone to see. What the hell is that?  I know what the hell it is. Him checking out other girls in front of me. Him never changing his profile to say something other than "Interested in Dating (Women)" even though I asked him to, and finally, him saying that he didn't want to be my boyfriend and was not interested in making any commitments. I know that I'm better off without him -even my mother knew this after only meeting him once- but I can't help but feel sad. Really really sad.
