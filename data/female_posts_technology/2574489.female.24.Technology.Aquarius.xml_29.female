The biggest bump was Woody, who did not want to spend the money.  Since it was my refund money I told him he could stay in the car while Rhy and I picked it up.  He was pouting like a big baby, and I kept teasing him for being Mr. Cheapo.  Finally, we got to Fry's.  They did not have the models I was looking for.  But I went with an  urlLink HP PSC 1350 all-in-one printer  that was reasonably priced.   I went over budget because it didn't come with the photo print ink cartridge that was the reason I bought it in the first place, and it didn't come with a USB cable.....(sigh)I was so mad at myself for not reading the box.  But I have it now, and it came with sample photo paper.  I trekked back to the store at 9 pm last night to see if I could return the incompatible glossy photo paper I bought for it (which I've already opened) but they were already closed.  I cussed like a sailor because I was so mad at myself.  Damn me for being so impatient!  I made all the other purchases in a hurry.  But that was Sunday.  Let's rewind:  Saturday Rhy slept over and we tried to shake things up by not going to the same places again.  So we tried a new Asian restaurant called Lava Grill.  It was excellent.  Most excellent was discovering Rhy's acquaintance from work, AJ, worked there and made a free order of pot stickers available.  Woody and I shared chicken pad thai, which was also very good.  It was all capped off by fried banana ice-cream, with 3 different ice cream flavors: green tea, red bean and mango.  We're definitely going back.    Afterwards we went to play!  I wanted to go bowling but the lanes at Main Event were booked up and wait was 1 hr and 45 min long.  So we headed to their arcade area and played some DDR, basketball and air hockey.  Much better for burning off calories. ;-)    We also watched the Medallion.  Ebert gave it two-thumbs up.  Ebert is stupid.  We also watched Ringu, the Japanese movie that inspired the Ring.  The Ring was better.  We had fun watching the second one because  we're trying to learn Japanese.  Rhy brough over his Pimsleur CDs that teaches you Japanese simply by listening.  It's great.   Wakarimas ka? (do you understand)?  The best part about the weekend is that its stll not over...for me anyway.  I have the day off...Mwahahahaha!
