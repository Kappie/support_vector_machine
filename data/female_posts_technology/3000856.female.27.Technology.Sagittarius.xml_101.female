Worked on the song again yesterday for quite a bit. It is pretty much done, but now I keep going over and over trying to figure out what part does not sit well w/ me. Hmmmmmmm I will go over it w/ my sister tonight she will be brutely honest w/ me so hopefully it will be totally finished by Sun. I watched Ethan for Mikee last night. He is a good kid although he would not go to sleep unless he was laying directly on top of me! So I could not do anything until after he was asleep and then Collen got sick sooooo.......my night was not too productive. Didn't even have a chance to go to the gym. Jim stopped over for a few min last night to pick up some pictures from Fl. He was laughing his ass off at some of them. I am so ready to go to Boston. It's not fair, they are  (Mike and Steve) mixing and goofing around and having fun and I am on the other line of the phone well over 800 miles away! :(  Mike (boston) I know there are way too many of them! LOL Anyway, he was mentioning a possibility of going back to Fl in Sept sometime. That would be great although I would only be able to fly down for a couple of days. His place in Fl is huge and he says he can never fill it. Don't worry I'll fill it for ya! LOL Ok gotta go work it's Fri and I don't want to be here late for any reason. Everyone have a great Fourth of July weekend!
