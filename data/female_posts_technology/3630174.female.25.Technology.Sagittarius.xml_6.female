Imagine rules like 1) HAVEto at least repeat the caller's name twice 2)CAN'T say 'bye' to the caller, even though they say 'bye' to you (the most stupid rule I think) 3) HAVE to close the call with 'Thank you for calling XXXXX (company name)" 4) CAN'T even have a single 'umm' or 'err'or 'uh-huh' in the whole conversation  So damn tedious I think, and make me sound mechanical.. a few days ago, a caller thought she was speaking to a machine instead of a human being... huh!  And ya know what? every week, they sit down with ya, listen to the voice recordings of your conversations (picked randomly) and fill up this checklist. then they give u a score, and that score bloody goes into your appraisal.. which determines your bonus.... SUCKS!!!
