I ordered the 10" one and left four slices for the people at home.  An ambulance trailed behind the jeep I was in on the way home.  It went weeoo, weeoo, weeoo.  I'm sure that when we hear an ambulance's cry, we wonder what happened to the person inside.  We wonder at the drama unfolding inside.  We wonder if maybe the driver is simply just in a hurry.  Just like in the movies?  The middle window on the right side of the ambulance was open about 4 inches wide.  The vehicle wasn't trailing behind now, but coming along side our jeep.  I observe my fellow passengers' actions when the opening comes within eye level.  Amusing to see heads turn, eyes peer.  It's like seeing a sexy woman and watching how the male species react to her.
