I think it's for Monday night at the Ridge around 7 or 730.  I also have one extra Asian Moon tix for someone if there is an interested party.  I'm going on Sunday the 13th w/ Jen.  Again,if someone is interested, cool.  Received an email about my airline confirmation for Fiji.  I almost cried.  I'm so filled with excitement that I wish it to be the beginning of October now but then I would miss a few of my favorite things like the music at Summerfest, Irishfest, a week with the niece and nephew, and the start of fall here.  The later is close to my ultimate fav.  Thanks to those that are posting some responses to my questions.  I do apprec!  Also thanks to those folks reading.  I don't have a count of how many visit (yet!) but I know there is more than myself and one other reading this blog.  Thanks!!  OK what is the big hubbub about a now dead president?  Does the fucking world stop cause he's dead?  Hell no.  We are still fighting for every damn dollar earned.  I agree with some that he was a good pres but good gravy so were some that are still living.  Do we need to spend more tax dollars on a 21 canon salute for the man?  Wouldn't that money be spent better on research on stem cells, on cancer, on AIDs for christ's sake!  TV stations are going to interrupt current programming to cover the parade of the coffin and military pomp.  Is that really necessary?  Is this really generating enough revenue to help the deficit or just the DC area?  Another big question, will another president, currently living, get this kind of fanfare when they die?  I doubt it.  News even mentioned that we haven't done this since Lyndon Johnson.  Why is that?!  Does a president have to have some building or room named after them to get this kind of recognition when dead?  Fuck that!  Maybe they should honor Reagan by not having political commercials for the entire week or so until he's buried.  I could live with that.  On for more fun news and other good stuff.  This is a bit self titled cause I can. hehe  Here's another rampage, you are now warned.  What is with self titled music albums?  Are they supposed to be incites into the person?  Incites on what is going on with them about 6 to 9 months ago?  I'm curious but then again if you've gotten this far, you would have gathered that by now. :)  Should also have gathered that I question just about everything too.  Sometimes I also notice the little stuff and question that too.  I feel questions give incite into the person asking and answering.  Some ask questions just to have those same questions asked back.  OK I am guilty of that as well.  Eh, I'm human, deal with it.   Now for the tough question:  On your list of resolutions, how many, if any, have you started, finished or completed by now? (check the comments for my answer ;)  )
