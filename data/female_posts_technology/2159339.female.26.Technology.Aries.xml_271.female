I'm in the grey area which equals "medium-risk for potential health problems." My pants have been getting snug, but I've blamed it on shrinking pants. I assume when one pair shrinks, they're all in on it, so they all shrink together. When I stood on the scale and the nurse kept tapping the square thingy further up til I weighed 17 lbs more than I normally weigh, I assumed it was my wallet and my shoes. When I was at my mother's house and she suggested we try her scale and it read the same weight, I immediately assumed I had a 17-lb ulcer or a massive goiter hidden somewhere (most likely my huge gut).   So anyway, I'm going to try to lose some weight, but not without resistance and plenty of whining. Yesterday I left my mom's house at 8:30 citing "tiredness" and she goes, "What? You're so young! Why are you tired?" and I said jokingly, "I'm FAT mom! Fat people get TIRED easily!"
