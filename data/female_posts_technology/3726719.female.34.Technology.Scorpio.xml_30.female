And this one looked like it had been well played with.   The thing I'm wondering is, if the cat door was open and they could only get to the patio....was the mouse really dumb enough to run onto a patio with three cats on it!?!?!?   Or, did the mouse somehow make it's way into the house and then died of fright when it saw the 3 cats????  We may never know what really happened....the dead mouse has been disposed of and all seems well.  Of course the cats are eating a WHOLE bunch more food all of a sudden.  I'm thinking of putting them back on the cheap stuff!!  :o)
