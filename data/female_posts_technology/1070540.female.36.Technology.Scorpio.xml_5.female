It is not that anything is wrong...But I tend to worry more than anyone knows... and there maybe times that I need to express it, but dont want to bother you with it.   This is a good way for me to ponder, I can write it down...come back to it when I am in a better frame of mind.  I just want you to know...if you ever worry or wonder whats going through my mind..just come here and look K....ok..cause I do love you with all my heart and soul.....I am so  Happy that I have you and our bri bri in my life.  I couldnt imagine life with out the both of you.  I love you BABY!!
