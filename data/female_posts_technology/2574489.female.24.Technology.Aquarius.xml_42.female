I am continously having to put people on mute why I sneeze and blow my nose or cough.  And they're like "hey are you there?"  while I'm having to pause my nose-blowing, take them off mute, and say "yes, Ib he, blease holb" (nose congested getting in the way of normal professional tone).  Yesterday my coworker B turned to me in a conspiratorial way.  b: let's call in sick tomorrow me: yeah, okay.  Its a pact!  A few hours later he comes up to me again  b: well, what would we do if we call in sick? me: stay home and get some rest! b: its no use staying home.  if we're calling in sick it should be for something that's worth it.  lets go to work. me: you little %#%$%$%$%$!  Okay, so pact broken and I'm at work today.  I would list a funny anecdote but I'm not feeling it.  Let me try again......nope, can' feel it.  Oh, but hi to my tito dandy!  Hi tito, you're dabomb.  He always keeps in touch and sends my mom pirated DVDs and crap like that.  He's cool.
