That place has changed so much, it is not what it used to be. Then I went and got my eyebrow repierced and brought my sister out to the bar. She got wasted it was actually kind of funny! Sun we went to Navy Pier all day. Spent lots of money. By the time we got home we were so tired. Had to do some shopping and get some stuff done before we could relax. She leaves Thurs, I can't believe it. I feel like she just got here and she is already leaving! I am having issues w/ someone else right now. I love him to death, but I think he is being very selfish and I don't like some of the comments he has been making lately. You know me though I don't deal w/ bull shit. Yes I miss him but there are certain things that are out of my control right now and if people can't understand that.....well as bitchy as it may seem I don't need them to bring me down. Enough of that a very good thing is that I am leaving for Boston in 4 days! I catch my plane directly after work on Fri! Busy busy day. That's all for now. Until next time.
