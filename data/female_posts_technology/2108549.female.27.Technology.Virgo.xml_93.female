I proved them wrong and I proved myself wrong.  One foot in front of the other, I have managed to survve this last year and not only grow from it, but stay mostly sane as well.  This weekend will be a big weekend of reflection for me.... a year ago I thought I couldn't stand to live even one more.  Now, I made it and lived to tell about it.
