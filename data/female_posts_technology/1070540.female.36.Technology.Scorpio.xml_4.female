We are looking into getting him a new vehicle.  I was wanting one myself.  But I have changed my mind.  I dont really care what people think ya know.  Screw them is my attitude.  If you dont like my mercedes....then stick it up your rear.   I really want to loose weight but I find it impossible not to eat at least something.  So I am going to try to eat a little at lunch time...and then that be my last meal.  I think I can do that.  I want to stay sexy for my baby....  See how my mind goes...I keep thinking and thinking....I want to clear my head.......well gotta go..am going to go help my mother n law move.
