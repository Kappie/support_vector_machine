You can be fired for any reason, you can be fired if you're pregnant (against the law in Israel for regular employees, but always the case at these banks - if you're temporary), you get no insurance.  You can't be a temporary worker for more than 18 months. At the end of this period, you either become a permanent employee (which brings security, higher pay, better terms) or get fired.   My sister wants to have a second baby, but without a second income (hers, in addition to her husbands) she can't afford another child. (The average cost of a child in Israel is 3000 NIS per month).   So my sister waits until the 18 months pass, to become a permanent employee. So she can get pregnant without being fired. So she can count on an income.  Today - 16 months have gone by and my sister had her Review. My sister will not become a permanent employee.  This means she will be fired within 2 months.  This means she can't have a baby.     My little brother likes to keep his life private, and hates it when we worry about him. After all, he is not so little anymore.  He calls us, his "four mothers" (As in the Four Mothers from the bible) - My grandmother (who lives with my folks), My mom, My sister, and I.  He discovered a mole on his thigh that was growing large and dark.  He secretly went to see a dermatologist yesterday.  The dermatologist said the mole looks dangerous and should be removed immediately. He scheduled surgery for the following day (today).  My brother went to the procedure alone. He didn't tell anyone. He had the mole removed, 3 stitches placed, and the mole was sent for a biopsy. The dermatologist told him it didn't look "friendly".  We wouldn't have found out at all, had my grandmother not noticed the bandage on his leg when he returned.  Results will come in a week.     My uncle is a sick man. He is overweight, is manic depressive and on medication, and is very diabetic.  He lost his mind and his soul many many years ago and leads a miserable life.  Today he found out he also has skin cancer. He probably won't live much longer.     I got my first P.O. (Purchase Order) today. $140,000. The first deal I closed on my own.  I have waited for this for months. Thought I'd be happy.  Instead - I've spent my day in gloom.
