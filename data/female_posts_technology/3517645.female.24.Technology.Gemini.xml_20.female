I took Harley for a walk last night, well half jog and well we were on our adventure a dog came running and barking at us from one of the homes along the road. Harley and him sniffed each other for a moment, than the little dog turn a bit at him. I was like holy jus Harley please don't do anything and he didn't I was so happy. I managed to get him moving again down the road. There was also another dog across the street, an older german shepard, that was watching the whole thing. He must of thought the little dog was crazy.  Duane was off all day yesterday and didn't accomplish much but spend money as usual. He was suppose to get up early and go and get a part to fix the lawn mower so the lawn could be done. It has been like two weeks since it was done, but he didn't. We finally went to Canadian tire at like 9 to get the part and it was fixed by 9:30, but it was to late to mow the lawn. Now he is back to work today, which means I will have to do it when I get home. well it will be a good workout for me anyways. It just takes so bloody long, 2hours, to mow it.  well that is all for today. I might post later if I get bored at work.
