Lack of exercise is an easy fix…I joined a gym and go there about 3 times a week… as for over eating ..being from a traditional guju family it hard not to over eat.. and living in the states doesn’t help.. here every fast food place has a super size option…and u feel guilty if u say no for a mare .99 cent option… so in turn when while enjoying an over sized Veggie Whopper and super size fries and ice tea.. at bite number 4… I’m obviously full and I still have ¾ of my burger left and all of my fries… however I slowly proceed to eat everything just cuz I feel bad throwing it out.. it weird.. I feel like crap the minute I get up… I do this at home too.. mom’s have ways of stuffing their kids till they blow.. they pour fresh ghee on kitchadi not knowing that they are killing u softly with cholesterol… and they pile up roti’s in your plate thinking that u just got out of the Somalian desert.. and my stupid dumb*ss eats it all cuz I will have to avoid another lecture on how children in Calcutta are starving.. what does that have to do with me…I seriously need to understand that there is no need to over eat.. and it not my problem that in the US they serve huge portions of food… I just have to learn that it ok to throw it out or big home a doggie bag… whatever it takes but not to take another bite after my tummy yells out .. "THAT’S ENOUGH LADY!”   Question of the Day…  What do u find yourself doin that you should avoid..?
