Dick Lee (guessed it!), Douglas Olivero (cool! think he need stock up on his foundation liao.), Florence Lian (she's still around?! :O) and some Hype Record director-talent scout who discovered Jeanette Aw, Phyillis Quek and Michelle Saram. (does he know music? director so free one ah?)  Of the lot, Florence Lian looked questionable. Can a former DJ know much about being a singer? I wonder how will SI turn out. The host already turns me off but I'll be curious to find out who are the people competing and are they any good.   One thing for sure, I won't have the courage to audition when I know my own standard. Hahaha. :P
