I probably should send a card but I need to get his mailing address first.   Next week is another long weekend for me. It is Labour/May Day on 1 May. Although it is a Saturday and I do not have to work on Sat, I get 'compensated' for the lost holiday on the following Monday. Hence on Friday night, I'm taking a 10hr coach ride up to Penang, a state in the north of Malaysia. It's not a bustling city like the country's capital, Kuala Lumpur but it's known for lotsa yummy local food.   I'm pretty broke with the strings of short trips. First it was to Kuala Lumpur and Genting Highlands in Feburary. Next was Bali in Feb/Mar. Followed by Pulau Tioman in April and now, Penang in May. Wow, almost every mth one trip.   I hope next trip will be a diving trip. The monsoon has shifted to the west coast so the popular dive sites in the east are really busy now until end Sept/Oct.   I want to accumulate my wealth, and I want to enjoy life as well. So, maybe just one more trip for diving and that's it for the year. =D I hope I can squeeze in a trip to Sydney next year. My ideal plan would be to drop by Sydney for probably a weekend and move on to Perth or Melbourne. I think, if I can, I will drop by Sydney each time I go to Australia. There's just these people that I want to see so much in Sydney. Sound as if I have all the money I want to. Yeah right! Haha. That's why I said, ideal.. which rarely can be that perfect.   Guess all I need is either a rich husband/boyfriend, a well paid job, or an active, properous investment. ;)
