White wrote an essay called The Family Which Dwelt Apart, it was about a family that lived on a island far from people. They would go off the island when they needed something from the town. One winter they were stuck on this island because of the bad whether. Someone in town heard that one of the kids of the Pruitt had appendicitis and sent people to help them. Some of the people died and they tried to help the boy but he ended up dying anyway. The house burned to the ground and the last boy found a town to live in.   The tone of the story was up bet. The story showed the start with the best place and time to put the reader in the right mindset to absorb details when it starts on an island and the boy appendicitis ruptured. It showed a family on a small island living the way they wanted to live. Then the storm broke out and they were trapped on the island with no resource. Finally the boy died and the brother moved away.   I like this essay because it showed a happy beginning and a sad ending. I liked the part where the whole town tried to help them off the island. It showed how people help each other.
