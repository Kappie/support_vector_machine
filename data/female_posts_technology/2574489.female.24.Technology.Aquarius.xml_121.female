I was really psyched because I've wanted to get Photoshop CS and it is freaking expensive.  Well, its freaking $150 more expensive there than on Amazon.com! What kind of educational discount is that?    !!( Growl grumble snarl snap foam-at-mouth )!!  I just really want Photoshop, but it's mostly geared to graphics designers.  That's why it ranges anywhere from high $400 to as much as $800.  Does anyone have any suggestion on a design software that won't quite burn a hole in my pocket?    *this is a mild Filipino cussword
