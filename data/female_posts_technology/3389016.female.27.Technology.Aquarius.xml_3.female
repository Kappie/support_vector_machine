When we finally find a phone (we figure we are going to need to call a cab since we are late from the luggage incident) and are reading it to see if we can use it to call the ship (it is not in English, but come on we are both System's Engineers. How hard can it be to figure out how to use a phone right?), just then a guy walks up and asks us if we are going to Royal (he is wearing a RCCL jacket). He saw us wandering tired with our luggage and figured that we were the ones he was looking for. Thank God! urlLink
