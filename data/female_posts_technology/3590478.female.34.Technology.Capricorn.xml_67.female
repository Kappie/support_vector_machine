(apparently she had a lot of questions about correct colors and styles and stuff. All of which Heather didn’t know the answers to. And by “didn’t know” I mean, “didn’t care”. Heather didn’t have the time or patience to talk to a former cheerleader 5 times a day.) So finally she made me in charge of fielding the calls. Yay me! I love to talk to cheerleaders, they’re so perky. I can’t pull off perky. On me it just looks mentally challenged or drunk. (Hey, I just realized, I do have radar of sorts. I can spot former cheerleaders!)  Ok, this is off the topic of uniforms but still falls under the heading of cheerleader. When I went to that Seth Green movie there was a local high school squad waiting to greet him. Rhoda finally had to smack me in the back of the head I was staring so hard. “Can we please go inside the nice, air conditioned building now?” Rhoda said. “But we’ll miss all the jumping and squealing!” I replied. “Wipe the drool off your shirt or Seth Green is going to think you’re mentally challenged” she said.  Um, I really don’t have any more about the uniforms except we will look great and all the geeky nerds, storm troopers and various and sundered super heroes at Dragon Con will desire us. One more, tiny, sad really, thing. Once I used “were you a cheerleader back in high school?” as a pick up line and it worked. (Honestly, I doubt that was what did it but that’s my story and I’m sticking to it.)
