I love to take photos or snapshots of anything and everything.  Sometimes, I wonder how I will ever get all the pictures organized that I already have.    I did start a Creative Memories class but shortly  after beginning that I moved back to my hometown and now I haven't had time to get around to it because creating a special kind of photo is very time-consuming.  I also have a three year old, Riley, who would like to just tear into all my stickers and markers and different jagged scissors I use when working with my pictures so I need to wait until his Dad takes him. By then I'm too tired and  I take time to relax and watch a movie instead. I also have two girls that also keep me very busy.
