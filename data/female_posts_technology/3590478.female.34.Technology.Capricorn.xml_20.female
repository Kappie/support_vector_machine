You really won’t enjoy it though because, after all, no one’s as good as you.  Taurus: Yes, after much whining and begging. Then you’ll decide you’re in love. Let the stalking begin.  Gemini: You’d really like to but it isn’t going to happen for you. Too bad, if you weren’t so fickle you’d see action, it’s standing right next to you. Twit.  Cancer: Yes, you’ll get laid. After weeks of manipulation and pouting you’ll manage to pull off some mighty fine guilt sex.  Leo: Multiple times with various people. They won’t enjoy it but that’s really not an issue is it? You’ll have a great time.   Virgo: Nope, none for you. You almost will but then, what with all the exact directions you’re giving, your partner gives up. Who cares though? If they can’t follow a few simple instructions, why bother?  Libra: You will but you’re really not interested. It just seems easier that way. You’ll be wracked with guilt over the whole experience.  Scorpio: Yes. Get naked. Lie down. Get busy. Get done. Do not repeat.  Sagittarius: Almost. But then you have to go and point out that unattractive thing on your partner and that pretty much kills the mood.  Capricorn: “Valentine’s day is a contrived holiday foisted onto the unsuspecting public to sell goods and services during a slow shopping season.” So saith the Capricorn.  Aquarius: Yes, quickly and bizarrely. Then you’ll publish a dissertation on the oddities of your partner and the whole experience in general.          Pisces: Oh, you bet. By humans residing in this dimension, plane or planet? Well, that’s anybody’s guess.
