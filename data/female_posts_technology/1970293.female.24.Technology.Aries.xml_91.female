The sooner she finished the sooner she can go home, get ready, and go out on the town tonight.  Her mind kept drifting to her clothes and the activities she would delve into when the sun goes down.    She planned to wear this little black spaghetti straps number showing off her shoulders and most of her back with the length reaching the floor.  With her hair up in ringlett curls enhancing her neck and her face to perfection.    Her fingers moved rapidly across the keyboard most likely making as many mistakes as not.  She just couldn't sit still long enough to finish this work.  She started to think of ways around this mound of work without anyone noticing.    Kate stopped for a second and glared at the folders sitting in her in basket.  She pushed her brown hair behind her ears as she quickly tapped her fingernails on the desk.  Her frustration starting to show through her features.    She glanced around the office quickly though there wasn't very much to see inside this small cubicle.  An in and out box as well as a small struggling dehydrated plant yearning for sunlight sitting on the corner of her desk.  The shelves above her desk filled with office supplies as well as old completed work.  A few pictures taped to walls of her animals and a few friends.  Anything to cheer up this small depressing space of ill-managed small space called an office.    She jumped as the phone rang.  She hated that phone.  It was always so quiet inside her cubicle even though noise filtered through the walls from the other cubicles enough to sound like a riot.  "Hello.  This is Kate.  How can I help you?"  She quickly answered.  "Kate, this is Mr. James. Can you please come into my office for a moment."  A male voice sounded into her ear.  That of course was her employer.  He never spoke to her unless it was extremely important.  This is not good.  She sighed.  She stood up from her chair and quickly placed her jacket on before straightening her hair and clothing.  Quickly she moved down the hallway smiling to those few co-workers that she have talked with before.  His door of course was located at the other end of the cubicle maze so she had to weave through the little hallways.  All too soon the brown oak door stood in front of her.  She smiled at the secretary and told her name and that he was expecting her.  The secretary beeped him to let him know she was here and she was given the go-ahead to continue through the door.  Mr. James sat at his desk with a folder open full of paper.  It looked he was studying the information with a fierce determination.  "Yes, Kate, please sit down."  He waved her to the chair in front of his desk.  "You wished to see me, sir."  Kate asked tentively as she sat down.  "Yes, I have been going over these papers for a while now.  I don't understand exactly the information shown here.  Now this is the folder that you worked on and I believe that you made a mistake.  Why don't you look at the papers and tell me what you think?"  He slowly scooted the folder to the other side of the desk.    Kate took the folder and slowly flipped through all the papers.  He was right.  It didn't make sense but yet she could remember filling the papers out.  She also remembered filling the paperwork out correctly and not like this.  She shook her head.  "Sir, you are correct.  The paperwork here is wrong.  I don't remember doing the paperwork in this manner but since it is right here in front of me, there is no excuse for this work that I can offer you."  Kate said quietly, thinking quickly.  She didn't understand the condition of the paperwork.  "You've been with us for a while now and so I will let this go.  Next time though I will have to take a more direct action.  Please redo this and give it to my secretary as soon as you finish.  That will be all."  "Thank you, sir."  Kate left quickly with the folder.  She thanked whichever providence was looking over her at that moment.  She smiled at the secretary on her way out and scurried quickly to her cubicle.  Quickly she opened the folder up and glanced at the date.  Unlike most employees, she actually kept a backup of all completed work on a cd organized by date.  She grabbed her keys and opened up her locked filing cabinet crammed in behind her.  She grabbed the cd marked with the same date as the paperwork inside the folder.  She pulled up the work and noticed something strange.  It was the same and yet it wasn't the same as the papers.  The original was different.  She glanced through the work quickly and reprinted it out.  She placed the work into the folder and quickly dropped the folder off at the secretary's desk before going back to her desk.  Who could have done that to her?  Someone was out to get her for some reason or another.  She shook off those thoughts and quickly turned to her other work.
