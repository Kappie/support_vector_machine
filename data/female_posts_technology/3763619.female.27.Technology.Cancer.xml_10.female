I am now 27 years old, still younger than most of the people I hang out with, but at the same time, it's hard for me to believe that's how old I am.  I started working full-time while most of my friends were still in college; and therefore, I was always the youngest one in the office.  Now the people that are coming in are younger than me.  Not that age is a big deal; it's just an interesting transition.  I saw my niece yesterday, who just turned 15.  Watching her and listening to some of the things she was saying made me happy to not be 15 and kind of wishing I was that age again all at the same time.  With age comes wisdom, as they say, so I think I'd only want to go back to that if I knew now what I didn't then.  Anyway, driving home from the gym today, I started thinking about my life, the people in it, my personality, and how it all fits together.  I thought about how I've really changed over the past few years and how independent I am.  I've always been independent, but I've become even more so in more recent years.  I thought about how maybe my independence is alienating some of my friends and that I may be shutting some of them out of my life without even realizing it.  Then I thought about my family, and I realized the only person I can ever truly count on 100% of the time is my mom.  My Mom and I have always been close, but there was a time when I thought it was the worst thing in the world to be home with her on a weekend.  Now I ask her to do things with me on the weekend.  Again, I guess that's where the age thing comes in.  I'm finally realizing all of the sacrifices she's made for me and how she has always been there when others weren't.  I know none of this is earth-shattering.  It's just that a lot of times transitions just happen; whereas, I noticed it and am watching it happen.  It's a strange place to be in.
