I will be sharing these posts with you on the upcoming posts.  I hope that you will enjoy and share the excitement that I felt as I embarked upon this new journey! :))    I checked my emails as soon as I woke up  my mother sent me an email that was quite disconcerting -- my cousin was having brain surgery this morning.  I prayed hard this morning and struggled between going to San Antonio and missing my ordination or going to my ordination.  I turned to God  asked Him.  What I heard from Him was that [my cousin] was in his hands and He was watching over her; I should go to my ordination  installation as a Deacon.  I also had the t.v. on at the same time and Joel Olsteen from  urlLink Lakewood Church  was speaking.  One thing that stood out was:  "I have the favor of God."  I took that as a confirmation of my decision to stay today.  I'm glad I went becuase I really got the opportunity to know some of the people so much better.  It was so comforting to be surrounded by so many friends while inside I was praying feverishly for the success of the surgery.  What a blessing it is to have the Church to turn to in the times of praises  of needs.   "The fruit of the Spirt is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.  If we live by the Spirit, let us also be guided by the Spirit.  Let us worship God."  -- excerpts from the  urlLink Woodlands Community Presbyterian Church .   In the call to Worship, this really spoke to me and a reminder of what may have well been the motto and inspiration behind my Grandma - my life role model - and probably should be adopted by myself as well as everything I do in life is to live by the Spirit and affect others with my catagious love for Christ.   BRANCHES OF THE VINE .  What a perfect sermon to have on this day of all days.   We are the branches supported by the life line of our God.  I had never quite thought about it quite that way, but it makes perfect sense.  In the children's sermon, the lady made an analogy between the fruit  flowers of the plant being equated with our talents.  I liked that analogy very much. . . .  "The church is founded on Jesus Christ.  We acknowledge that Christ chooses to be known in the world  through this community of ordinary people .  Christ is the foundation of the church, therefore it will not fall.  The church is marked by the Holy Spirit. Across the centuries since the church was founded, the Spirit has formed and identified it.  We recognize the true church of Jesus Christ whereever the work of the Spirit is evident :  in preaching and sacraments, in the new life and continuous growth of believers, in the sharing of spiritual gifts and material things, in mission and service to the world." I loved reading this Statement of Faith today -- especially, in light of the upcoming trip to Guatemala.  I am hoping that I will be able to see the work of the Spirit being evident in Guatemala in spite of their strifes they have had during the past decades.  I am so interested in seeing the workings of God in the rest of the world beyond the comforts and confines of my own home.  Seeing the world as it is and not as a tourist fantasy is important to me. This song [following]is sung to the tune "Morning Has Broken"...a beautiful song:   God The Creator   God the Creator, you in love made me, who once was nothing, but now have grown.  I bring the best of all my life offers, for you I share whatever I own. O Christ the Savior, you in love called me, who once was noone, lost and alone.  I pledge to go wherever you summon, making your will and purpose my own. O God the Spirit, you inlove move me, who oce was noshere and felt unknown.  I know my need of you for companion, all things can change when not on my own. And with the people summoned together to be the Churhc in which faith is sown.  I make my promise to live for Jesus and let the world know all are his own. This [the following song], in a sense, is the signature song of our Church as a result our committment to our sister Church in Africa.  It brings back such good memories from their visit to our Church last fall during our stewardship campaign.  It is very moving (in every sense of the word).  We Are Marching -- author unknown, sung by members of sister Church in Africa   We are marching in the light of God, we are marching in the light of God. We are marching in the light of God, we are marching in the light of God. We are marching, ooh! We are marching in the light of God. We are marching, ooh! We are marching in the light of God.  We are singing in the light of God ...   We are praying in the light of God ...   We are dancing in the light of God ...  We are marching in the light of God ...  Perhaps, I will be able to bring back with me some songs from the Guatemalan culture as wel.  This trip is the most exciting thing I have done in such a very long time.  How will God demonstrate His blessings on this trip?  Only time will tell.  We will be leaving inless than 3 weeks away. I checked in with my parents and my cousin survived the brain surgery.  She is in ICU now but not completely out of the woods just yet.  I continue my prayers for her. Dear God:  Please place your warm hands upon her and let her know that you are with her and assure her that her work on this Earth is not quite done.  Please also place your everloving arms around her entire family and comfort everyone as [my cousin] continues through her recovery process.  In your name, I pray.  Amen.   Another coincidence? Horoscope for Sunday, May 18th:   "A movie or an overheard conversation makes unusual sense although it's in a foreign language.   A global society grows from common human experiences.  Everyone recognizes a good opportunity."
