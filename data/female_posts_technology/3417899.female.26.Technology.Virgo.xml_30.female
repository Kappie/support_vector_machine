I am in town for business.  I ask them what their plans were in Guatemala, expecting to hear they were going hiking or backpacking or some other exciting reason to travel to this exotic country.  The response (in a deep Southern accent) catches me off guard: "We are going to adopt a baby".  They have a baby girl waiting for them in Guatemala. Sydney is 5 months old. They have already met her in March and spent a couple of weeks with her. It broke their heart to leave her there to come back to the US and complete the paperwork.  Now they were on their way to finally pick her up and take her home.  This delay - albeit being just a 24 hour delay - is devastating to them. You can tell in her voice. In his sigh.  One day shouldn't matter in the larger scheme of things... they will have her for the rest of their lives... she is worth the wait. I spurt so many cliches.   Puts my life in perspective - missing my sales meeting due to a late connection doesn't seem like the end of the world anymore.   P.S.  I like talking to random strangers on my travels. It may be interesting to include these strangers' stories in my blog. Defocus it from myself. I think I will just do that.
