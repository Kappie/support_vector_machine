I said to Paul, "Call me so I can record the number." The coworker it belongs to spent the AM talking on the office phone on the left ear while holding his cell phone to the right ear. It's annoying enough dealing with pagers and blackberries going off all the time but do I need to share my workbench with 'Mr. Two Phones' aka Yves?!   So I suggested to Paul that he place Yves cell phone in his pocket and walk around our area as I called the number. As we expected Yves hears the rings and pats his body down, checks his pockets and looks all around himself. The phone stops and I dial again. This time he looks around himself and asks, "Do you hear that?"! Of course I'm laughing as he beings to search his laptop bag and jacket pockets. Paul is standing near Yves talking to a user when I dial a third time! This time Paul, obviously distracted tells the user that he's holding Yves' phone in his pocket. She laughs, Paul laughs and I'm nearly out of my chair laughing when FINALLY Yves catches on!  Yes, we're that childish and find this to be one of the funniest jokes EVER. I know, we need to upgrade our lives or maybe we really are computer geeks after all..............
