I had his sister put down a few months ago.  I just feel guilty, what if I am making the wrong decision?  Or what if I already have because I've waited too long?  I don't think he's in pain.  He's not meowing any more than normal.  But he's not eating.  I bought him stinky ocean fish flavored soft cat food.  He ate a little bit of that.  And he has a lump on his chest, I guess you would say in his armpit?  It moves.    I don't want to take him to the vet for tests. He's so old I don't think I'd have him treated and prolong suffering.  I guess I'll just give it a day or so more, see if he eats any better, and then take him in.  Actually I'll have my boyfriend do it, so I don't wreck on the way home from sobbing so hard. He's not very attached to him.  (Actually I know he'll be relieved when it's finally done. His not a big fan of cats, but he's being nice and not saying that to me right now.)  I don't know. Maybe something will have changed by the time I get home....
