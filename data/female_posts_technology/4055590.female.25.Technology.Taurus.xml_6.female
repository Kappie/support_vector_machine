Sending flowers to a guy yes or no?    3rd date rule still apply ;) ?    How long before double dates?    IF you spend the night at his or her house, what to bring?    Okay everyone need a debate from both genders on this one. Dating do's and dont's. I have a few questions to ask, since as most of you know I am back in the hetro dating world! People I need your help. I want to hear from the girls and the boys on this one!
