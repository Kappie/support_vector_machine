I was contacted by these girls that are looking for a third roommate.  They said something like "You said you like to socialize and are easy to get along with, and that's what were looking for."  It made me realize how silly and generic my profile sounded.  Well I suppose it worked.  I scheduled a time and went to meet the girls and see the apartment.  It's a really nice place.  I was totally nervous to meet them.  I'm not sure why.  It felt like Tower bicker all over again.  Make a good impression in only a few minutes so that you can be one of the chosen ones.  But you also want to be yourself so that it actually is a good match.  If you're going to be a psycho roommate, I'd say you should just lay your cards down up front.  Anyway, I think it went well.  They were friendly and it seemed like a good match to me.  I needed a big hug after it since the whole meeting had been kind of stressful.  Maybe it's because girls are harder to impress than boys.  I'm a little nervous to find out if they picked me.  B said that I shouldn't take it as a negative mark on me if they don't want to live with me.  He says not every item on the grocery store belongs on every shelf.  He's a good boyfriend.
