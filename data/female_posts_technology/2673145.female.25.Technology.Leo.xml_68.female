"Voice call at 4:10am 12 April... Hey Rachel! Guess where I am?!..."  It was Charbel transisting at Changi Airport. I'm always glad he calls as he never fails to put a smile on my face.   Charbs, if you are reading this, Thank you. I was really touched that you bothered to scribble down my number just so you can ring me from the airport. If you had called me on my mobile, I would have chatted with you until you board your next plane. Yes, even thou it's 4 in the morning. The thought of you on the same piece of land excites me. I wish I could go to the transist lounge to meet you. Unfortunately, I can't just buy any air ticket like you suggested to meet you in the airport. Haha. Absence make hearts grow fonder. That makes me realise, I really do miss you a lot.
