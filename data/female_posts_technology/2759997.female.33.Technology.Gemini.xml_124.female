These guys are really cute - and most are extremely extroverted.  They come running when they realize you were suckered into buying a bag of peanuts (50 cents a scoop), and grab one right out of your hand.  Although, I did run across one picky little fellow, who waited patiently as I shelled his peanut and handed him one at a time.   urlLink     urlLink    The concerned look on my face reflects the thought process of "chipmunk bite, ER visit, rabies shot...".   urlLink     urlLink    This guy must have heard someone tapping a peanut on the ground - he's definitely interested in  something .   urlLink     urlLink    Joe feeding one of his furry friends.   urlLink     urlLink    Kind of cute for a rodent, huh?
