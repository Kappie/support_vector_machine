I spent some time tidying up a couple of files while waiting for the bugfix.  Now it looks like the bug isn't completely gone. Maybe I should just go home. I stayed a bit late yesterday, so I could probably justify leaving work a little on the early side today, especially since I can't do much on that project until the problem is fixed. I know it is probably a problem with the bugfix, because I hadn't changed my part of the code there. Knowing it is "somebody else's problem" is occasionally good, as long as the "somebody else" does something about it in a timely fashion.
