I will be sharing these posts with you on the upcoming posts.  I hope that you will enjoy and share the excitement that I felt as I embarked upon this new journey! :))    How much more on cue could this prayer be on the trip we are about to embark upon?  More than 40 yrs after Mr. Parson's death, we are still praying for peace among the nations.  No telling when the prayer was actually written.   Almighty God our heavenly Father, guide the nations of the world into the way of justice and truth, and establish among them that peace which is the fruit of righteousness, that they may become the kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.  Amen.  -- Edward Lambe Parsons (1868-1960)
