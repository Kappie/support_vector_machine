I never really spend time reading his whole blog but it is really unusual to see someone who is in prison, still have the 'mood' to write. He will be out this November if I am not mistaken. I wonder whether the first thing he is going to do is to sit in front of a PC and start blogging on his own. I wasn't sure what he did that he ended up in prison for I am too tired to read. I am exhausted but I do not want to go to bed yet. From my experience, for I am very good in putting clues together - I will say he hack into some bank account or something that has got to do with computers. Why do I say that? Because he works with computers before he went to prison. What an analyzer I am! haha!
