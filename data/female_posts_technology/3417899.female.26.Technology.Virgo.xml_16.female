       
      I am 26 years old and married. I have a career, a husband and self-confidence. I am good-looking enough to like what I see in the mirror - depsite the extra pounds. I am smart enough to be part of an intelligent conversation or even lead one. I am successful in many people's eyes and I lead a life one could envy.   And yet I still indulge in acts of shameless immaturity - swaying my hips when I walk out to lunch - just because he is looking. Biting my lips and looking into his eyes when we talk shop. Carelessly leaning my knees against his on the flight back form a business trip together. Feeling angrily deceived if he acts like he does not notice me (or maybe it's not an act).   What is it about me and authority figures? I had had an forbidden affair in the past with a manager. Dated a course instructor in the army. Why do I need to conquer them?   I love my husband. But I like to indulge in these forbidden acts of immaturity for a little flirty boost. And then I go back home. Never taking the flirtation any further.He never showing any signs of surrender.   I wonder what would happen if he did.
