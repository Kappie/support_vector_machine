Last week a close friend at work informed me that the government is calling troops back to duty, some having been inactive for 10 years or so.  Yep, you know what I'm going to say next.  My friend used to serve in the army and could possibly be called back to active duty.  When he mentioned this to me last week, I was scared for a minute but then figured nothing would come of it.  Today I asked if he'd heard anything, and he said his name is on that list of possible people to be called.  Only time will tell if he will have to leave his wife and three children behind.  I realize there are thousands of troops and families that have been going through this for the past two years, and while I feel for all of them, I don't know any of them.  I just don't know how you can make it mandatory to call people back when they haven't served for years, and they obviously left for a reason.  It just doesn't seem right to me, but then again, not everything in this world is right.  For the sake of his three children especially, I really  hope he gets bypassed.
