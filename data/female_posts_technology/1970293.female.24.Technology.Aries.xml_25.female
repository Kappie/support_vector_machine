The loud noise, the colorful clothing, all made a wonderful distraction for his profession as a thief.  His lips curled up into a grin as he saw his favorite target out buying supplies.  The cook for the kitchens of the castle was out buying the weekly supplies to feed the king.  He slipped through the crowds pretending to be another shopper on this day of errands.  He worked his way around the cook until he was right behind her and her entourage.  He waited for something to distract her attention from her actions.  He glanced behind and spotted the distraction.  A horse pulling a wagon through the market which is unheard of for the most part because of the crowds blocking the street.  He glanced back at the cook and waited until the rattle and the clip clop caught her attention making her look at the wagon.  There.  She looked.  He ran out from behind her, bumping her, grabbing her money, and running down a crowded alley.  He heard the entourage try to follow but soon there was too many people blocking his escape.  He laughed from the exhiliration of his heist as he continued onto his little hidey-hole which was located so far into the back alleys of the city that only the street waifs could find it.   He rounded the corner of an alley to the entrance of his hidey hole only to find someone already waiting for him.    He could see the stranger wearing a dark cloak that covered both head and body.  He stopped ready to turn around and pretend to be lost when the stranger suddenly turned toward him.    "Truan."  The stranger said quietly in a smooth voice that didn't give away anything about his character.  "Sorry that's not me."  Truan said quickly while back away from the stranger.  He didn't understand how he knew his name but he wasn't going to stay and find out.   All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003
