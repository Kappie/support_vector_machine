The author certainly demonstrated how one misunderstanding can lead to another misunderstanding and so on. What confused me the most was, who ever led anyone to believe that anyone had appendicitis? The author mentioned it at the beginning of the story for what seemed like a random statement and before you knew it, the whole thing got blown out of proportion.    I like the authors statement, "The winter would have passed quietly enough had not someone on the mainland remembered that the Pruitts were out there in the frozen bay." This statement kind of summed up the whole story. The Pruitts were very happy and content until someone assumed that they were not. I found the setting of a "remote island" to very appropriate for the story. The Pruitts found the isolation they desired, but by doing so, they actually made more problems for themselves. The lack of contact with society created more chaos than had they checked in on a regular basis and not let people wonder what was happening.
