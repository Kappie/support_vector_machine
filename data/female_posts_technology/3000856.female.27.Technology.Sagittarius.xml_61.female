I have practice tomorrow night and I am gonna be a zombie by the time that is over. Damn I should just give up sleep for the rest of the week. LOL I have to get my motorcycle permit and my address change on my license, pay some bills, clean, pack, get Collen a hair cut, go to the bank to w/ draw money for the trip, and pay that frigin ticket I got parking by Jeremy's in Wrigleyville! I am still pissed about that, but it was my own damn fault. Speaking of Jeremy, talked to him earlier and he is having a really loooooong bad day. All my friends want me to go out w/ them Thurs night before I leave but I know that is not happening! I need to drop off some clothes to good will. They have been sitting by my door for the past month and 1/2. Ok enough babble. I need sleep.
