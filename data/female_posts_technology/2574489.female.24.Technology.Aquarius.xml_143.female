Things on my mind right now:  Who won the Philippines Presidential election? The suspense is killing me!   Will Grissom and Sara actually start a romance? Aaaarghh!!!..no one answer this. I don't want to know yet.   Okay, those two are actually the only questions burning in my mind right now.    ***  Weekend update:  Hubby and I were supposed to go clubbing again with some friends of ours. On their way to our house they got into a wreck with a huge F150 truck, jacked up on suspension and gigantic tires. They were driving a small Mitsubishi Galant.  Guess whose car sustained more damage?    For those of you that need to compare, the truck was like one of thos Monster Truck Rally trucks.   I felt very bad for my friends. Hope they sort it all out.  But as a result of that, we didn't want to go out anymore. So we actually made our first visit to Blockbuster in months!  We rented a Kung Fu movie for hubby and, believe it or not, CSI Season 2 Disc 5. I couldn't wait anymore. I really thought they would develop the relationship between Grissom and Sara further, but no go.  On Sunday I treated Mom out to a  Mother's Day late lunch. Next weekend, we are going for a massage. It would have been this weekend but she had work.  Our lunch was at a cafe  bakery in a nice mall, and my, there were so many well-dressed families out that day! I saw a lot of mothers having a great time, mine included!  Sunday night, I played some Sim flash games from  urlLink ebaum's world  and did not get to bed until 2 am.  I am now contemplating buying the actual Sims game. However, there is a good possibility, hubby would disown me. He's already upset with the amount of time I spend on the computer. Adding Sims to the repertoire would be too tempting for me.  So maybe not.
