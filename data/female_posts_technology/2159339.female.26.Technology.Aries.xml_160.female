Everyone is wearing it. It lay on my desk awhile, and though I was reluctant to put it on because of its drab color, the emblazoned company logo, and the fact that it fits me like a sleeping bag, yesterday I wore it home because I forgot to bring a coat. I felt... like a soccer mom. I felt like... a frumpy American hausfrau. Boy is it soft and fuzzy, but man, is it shapeless and the opposite of sexy. I felt like I was in high school again, hiding myself in oversized baggy clothes. I've long outgrown these inhibitions because honestly, how can tourists marvel at my porcine pot belly if I'm wearing ill-fitting clothes? How can I flaunt my babyless bump in company fleece? It may be cozy and comfy like a blanket, but if I wear it, I might as well pin some mittens to my sleeves because it makes me look like a little kid: "Oh, she'll grow into it!" And you know what little kids are... snot-nosed perverts who have no fashion sense. I cannot be confused with them!  Comfort may also be the driving reason for  urlLink UGG boots . They're UGG-ly, and rank #2 for "Ugliest shoes in the world" (#1 being the irrefutable winner, Birkinstocks). People wear these monstrosities because Cameron Diaz wears them. People, come to your senses and shake off your sheeplike behavior! Uggs are unequivocally evil in their power to transform the smoothest sexiest legs into polska sausages. The length of the leg, the curve of a calf, and the comeliness of an ankle are wrongly obscured by these hideous beasts. Shame on you Cameron Diaz! You should be setting an example. You should be using your celebrity for good, not ruin.   On a final note, I'd like to salute the death of the ironic trucker hat. Death to irony and parody! Cheers to DIY, deconstruction, construction, and moving fashion forward! And a toast to the black zip hoodie, the classic staple of cool kids everywhere. I'm Batty Apple, and this is your Friday Fashion News.
