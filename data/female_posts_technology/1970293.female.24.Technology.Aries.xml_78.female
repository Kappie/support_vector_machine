He also took care of the library and all of the books and scrolls.   "Mandel, do you have a minute?" Bardric asked politely.  "Bardric, yes I always have a moment for you. How may I help you?" Mandel put his scroll on top of the table and waved Bardric to a chair opposite him.  "I need some information about a wizard who was here about a month ago. His name is Thandair. The book said that he was seeking knowledge of the Drakken." Bardric sat down quickly and spoke quietly.  "Oh yes, I remember. He looked through the books and the scrolls first and then he had to come to me for the information. I told him that he would find nothing written about the Drakken but that I could tell him what he needed to know since I was one of the wizards who created the barrier." Mandel spoke slowly as he remembered. His white hair grew unruly and long from inattention. It was shoulder length and his beard was just as long.  "There is a small problem now, learned one. It appears as if this Thandair has released the barrier and the Drakken are once more in the lands." Bardric clasped his hands on top of the table as he stated the bad news.  "It can not be. How could he have released the barrier? It took five of us to create it. The Drakken can not be loose upon the races. I thought he was just seeking knowledge not a way to undo our work." Mandel appeared to be in shock that a fellow wizard would abuse his knowledge to do something so evil.   "It is why I came to you. I knew that if anyone would know it would be you. We need your help. Can you tell me how you created the barrier and possibly any information you have on Thandair. I don't think I ever had the pleasure of making his acquaintance." Bardric allowed the man to digest the information.  "Well Thandair never went to the academy. Actually no one knows where he learned the art. He just suddenly appeared around ten years ago asking questions." Mandel sighed. "Asking questions about the Drakken. I should have realized."   Mandel continued to describe Thandair to Bardric. Some of the information wasn't very pretty but Bardric had to hear it all in order to understand his opponent. Mandel also told the story of the Drakken beginning with their creation, their acts of aggression, and finally their banishment. Bardric grew more concerned as he heard everything. It was time to get Trellian and look for this wizard and to figure out a way to return the Drakken to their lands.
