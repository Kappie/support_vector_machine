Almost done: Windy City Scarf (weave in ends) Blue/white Kitschy Kerchief (sew ties on, weave in ends) Booga bag (finish felting, block/dry, attach straps)  On the needles: Coney Island Fireworks Scarf (which I'm ignoring b/c I'm bored with garter stitch) Official Kittyville Hat (in some really scary cheap-ass Red Heart yarn...looks fairly cool, but needs some mega-softening--this one should end up being finished tonight)  Next up: Homespun hooded sweater Princess Snowball Cat Bed (from SnB) And maybe, if I feel really daring...socks. I'm scared of double point needles, but I want to learn to make socks, b/c, I mean, look at all the really cool self-striping sock yarn out there.
