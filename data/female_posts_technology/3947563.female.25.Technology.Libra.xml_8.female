Breakfast was a granola bar, lunch was a shake and an apple, I didn’t have a snack (bad bad,) dinner was more fish in veggie sauce with some “Chinese Vegetables” Then I tried to make a smoothie with a hand mixer instead of a blender. DISASTER. I still ate the mush I created (raspberries, strawberries, milk and some sweetener,) but it really wasn’t the same. Later on I had (1%) cottage cheese and melba toast for a snack. Also, NO COFFEE yesterday, I had tea instead.         I had to clean all the bunny and rat cages, so by the time I ate and digested it was raining, and I didn’t know what to do for a workout. I hadn’t done any cardio since Saturday, so I really had to get moving. I ended up going for an hour long run/walk in the rain. I’ll probably catch my death of cold, but it was actually kind of fun. I was able to run a lot further than I thought. The burning in my calves would cause me to stop, but hopefully that will improve as I build some muscle there. This is a big step for me; I have had asthma since I was a kid, so running is the one activity I have grown up REALLY hating, and avoiding at all costs. Maybe someday I’ll be able to go for a jog and not have to walk at all.                  Just so you guys know, I want to keep this up until I have lost all the weight – at least 20 lbs. I would like to achieve that by Christmas, and I think that’s possible. That would mean losing 4lbs a month for 5 months, and I really think I can do that. I will keep using this blog, and hopefully I will have some company. Ryan has been informed that if I am successful, he will be getting me a string bikini for Christmas which I will be wearing everywhere we go. “Hey mom and dad…”        A little bit of motivation – 99% of successful dieters claim the first two weeks are the hardest part – nd we’re more than halfway through them!
