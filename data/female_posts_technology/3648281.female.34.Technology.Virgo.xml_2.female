I can't get this code to thru and it is making crazy.   Date with Greg last night. We had Thai for dinner and he took me by his place to watch Sea Biscuit. Cute movie. Cute little horse. Greg scored big points with me last night. He is into art and has his work up around his house. Normally that might bother me but his stuff is tasteful. He also has a collection of photos that his grandfather has taken from around the world up in one room. Stunning. That's really all I can say. Greg has his shit together. He has a black cat. The last guy that I was crazy about had a black cat.  Tonight I am going out with the girls. We are having Sushi for dinner and then will make plans for the rest of the night. It's time for some girl time!! I haven't been out with the girls in a few weeks now and I am ready to go and get lit.  Archie is coming tomorrow to get some work done on this side project. It's wet today so I will be early working the lawn before he gets here.  Always too much to do.... I am going back to bed.
