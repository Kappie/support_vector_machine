Kearney, Florida is allowed to uphold the 1977 law  that prohibits gay people from adopting children.    In a statement released by the Family Pride Coalition  (www.familypride.org), Executive Director Aimee Gelnaw  said, "This decision is a crushing blow...The judges  in this case didn't just rule against gay dads and  lesbian moms...They ruled against thousands and  thousands of Florida children who need stable and  loving homes. It is appalling, unconscionable and  even negligent to turn their backs on the thousands  children in Florida who need loving homes such as  the ones provided for years by these plaintiff families."   The site www.lethimstay.com was created by ACLU to  educate the public about the adoption ban and the  background on Lofton v. Kearney.  Since last week's  ruling, the only addition to the website has been  the brief statement that the ACLU is "very  disappointed" and "carefully considering what steps  to take next."
