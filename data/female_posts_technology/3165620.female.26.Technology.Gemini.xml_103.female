Unfortunately, I bought the bottle at my local Rudy's and mailed it to him, so it cost a lot more than it would have if we'd ordered off the website. Any future BBQ sauce needs he has will have to be taken care of that way. Ooh, they have the spice rubs there too!  Dang it, I shouldn't websurf like this when I'm hungry. I'm not always much of a fan of the "piles of meat" restaurant, but occasionally it is good.
