Ever since I installed the software for my new HP printer it just hasn't worked right.  It's eating up my memory, and now when I check CPU usage its 100%!!!!!!!  I can't do anything!  I created another admin account, but it's just not the same! (yeah, i know, start playing the violins).    I'm trying to find a way to turn this into an opportunity to buy a new computer.  Our monitor is 5 yrs. old and the system is 3 yrs. old.  Its a freaking Micron PC with 433 Mghz  Celeron  processor, and about 198 MB of RAM.  It's just...not cutting it, you guys know what I mean....but guess why we haven't upgraded to a new system?  Even though I get a company discount on Dell systems.  Even though we have had to reload the OS on our system  twice  in the last year.    You got it. My husband.  He doesn't like to spend anything on our credit card, and he doesn't want to touch our savings...and he doesn't want to spend. Period.  Think I can crash this PC guys?  LOL!
