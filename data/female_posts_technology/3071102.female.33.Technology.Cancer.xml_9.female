    
       It is Sunday morning and I am contemplating paying bills and doing laundry after a nice, big, fat breakfast including just about every bfast food that one can eat in one sitting... Eggs, bacon, grits, toast, fruit!  Coffee with half and half even, I felt like I was at a hotel (with the exception that I made it AND cleaned it up). I am trying to track down a friend that is supposed to be in town, but I haven't heard from her yet. And her daughter isn't answering her phone, oh well... The kittens are on the porch, trying to bait birds to land on the railing... and it's starting out to be a nice lazy Sunday with no plans in front of me at all... except for the bill paying. I am so excited about my vacation that is up and coming! I get to see my cousin, step-sister, godson, grandma!  It hopefully, will be a nice break from everything that is or isn't happening fast enough in my life. Is it June yet?
