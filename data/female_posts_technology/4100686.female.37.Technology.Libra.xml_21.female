This blog is mostly a reference point, a sort of directory, but every once and a while i may have a thought and post it. If you ever see one of these stray thoughts be prepared for it to later disappear... think of these posts as fleeting moments of consciousness passing across the monitor.  If there is ever a link involved in these types of post i will always leave the link.
