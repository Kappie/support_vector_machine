As I wash clothes one day it appeared in my mind of my good friend who got married a couple years ago and now him and his wife are expecting there first child. Why does this strike me so well is because I see things that I want in a husband.  I want a husband who will support me with money. I want a husband that understands when I say things should be split 50/50. I want a husband that will cook for me when I am not up to it, he will massage my feet when I come home after a hard days work. I want a husband who will make sure the dishes are done when I have no time to do them and he will do this for me without me asking. I want a husband that will clean up after himself, this is hard to find but all men are trainable. I want a husband that does not need to be told to put the toilet seat down. I want a husband that will make time for me without making excuses because he is to busy.   I want a husband that will take care of my children when I need a break from life. I want a husband that with take care of my physical needs. I want a husband that will not complain when he feels that he is doing more then me. I want a husband that will take care of me when I am ill, he will bring me to my doctorâ€™s appointments and he will miss work if I want him to be home to take care of my ailing body. I want a husband that will not be jealous of my male friends. I want a husband who will listen to my problems and try to help me solve them without getting frustrated. I want a husband that will make sure there is food on the table, and to make sure the children are fed and in bed on time.    I want a husband that will take care of the arrangements when we go out on the town. I want a husband who is sensitive to my sexual needs, a husband that will make love to me passionately and eagerly and be worried about my needs and not his. And, of course I want a husband that will understand and not pout when I am not in the mood for him. I want a husband that will just give me the love and support he knows he wants in return.   Who woundn'twant a husband who can give her all these things?
