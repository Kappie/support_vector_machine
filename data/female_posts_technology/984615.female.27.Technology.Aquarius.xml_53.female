For those of you who care, and I doubt that there are many of you out there; I got word back from the law school that I applied to. I didn't get in. That and last night the beach bonfire I helped to host, well I had to leave BEFORE the freggin DJ's showed up unexpectedly. DAMN!!!  DAMN my god damned knees. I fucking wonder why god has it out for me sometimes. It is as if I am some real life sissiphus. I have ever only gotten so far...only to be crushed by some crap circumstance. Or maybe it could be the simple fact that I'm lazy... oh who cares. I'm bored. I think I'll go watch some TV.
