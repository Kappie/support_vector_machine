I'm going to hold off on talking about reunions until later tonight when I can post my pictures.    B and I went to see Oklahoma! on Monday and I loved it.  My favorite song is the subject of this blog entry.  Maybe I'll buy a shirt that says "I'm just a girl who can't say no."  Such a happy musical!  I'm a big fan of those super happy shows.  I don't like shows with sad endings.  That's why I like the WB and chick flicks.  The set of Oklahoma! was really cool.  It was on a rotating stage with lots of other pieces that rotated.  Sometimes I miss building sets for theater.  My favorite musical is A Chorus Line. I think it's because it's about dancing!  Oh yeah, I almost forgot.  When we were just sitting in our seats waiting for the show to begin, this woman sat down next to me and she had the most horrible really strong perfume.  It was HORRIBLE.  That's one of my biggest pet peeves. It's SO RUDE to wear so much perfume when you're going to be in an enclosed space with other people that can't move to different seats.  B was more forgiving of this woman, but he didn't have to sit next to her.  He said that she probably didn't realize she had too much perfume on.  I said I thought her husband should tell her these things, and he didn't agree.  I hope when I have a husband he'll let me know if I'm stinking up the place.
