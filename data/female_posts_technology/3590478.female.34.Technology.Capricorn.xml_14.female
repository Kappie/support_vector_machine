The sign of the ram. As in, “I’m going to ram my brilliant idea down your throat.”  Celebrity Aires: Shannon Doherty     Taurus-April 19-May 19 Stubborn and plodding. Sappy sentimentalists prone to hissy fits. Conservative dolts. You’ve not seen anything until you’ve seen a Taurus pitch one. Celebrity Taurus: Tori Spelling    Gemini-May 20-June 19 Fickle and restless, the Gemini never shuts up. Scatterbrained twits filled with unemotional logic. The sign of the twins. As in, “This single space occupied by two. Oh yeah, and I’m bi-polar. Go figure.” Celebrity Gemini: Jewel  Cancer-June 20-July 21 Sensitive pouty butts. Fond of emotional manipulation and vindictiveness.  “You’ve gone and hurt my widdle feelings and now my lip is stuck so far out it will take you 3 days of total ass kissing to fix it you hateful prate you.” Celebrity Cancer: Courtney Love    Leo-July 22-August 21 “Hi, I’m a Leo. Look at my breasts. They are truly magnificent. See how the world revolves around me in all my glory? Of course you do. You have my permission to start worshipping me now. Do it. I rock.”  Celebrity Leo: Delta Burke  Virgo-August 22-September 21 Picky and critical. Slapping that sensible smirk off of their repressed faces would be pointless as the Virgo would only take this as a sign that they are, as always, justifiably correct.  Their asses are so tight the jewelry manufacturers might want to consider the Virgo a quick source of turning coal into diamonds. Celebrity Virgo: Shelly Long      Libra-September 22-October 21 “Hi, I’m a Libra. Can’t we all just get along?” Big loads of fickle and indecisive hand wringing with this lot of tree hugging peaceniks. Celebrity Libra: Sharon Osborne   Scorpio-October 22-November 20 Dead serious pack of emotionally repressed buggers. Everything’s either black or white for the Scorpio. Subtle manipulation is a favorite method of operation.  Celebrity Scorpio: Hillary Clinton  Sagittarius November 21-December 20 The saviors of the zodiac.  Oh, not your savior, just a Jesus complex in general. They flit, they float, they suffer from a severe case of foot in mouth disease.  Celebrity Sagittarius: Sinead O’Connor  Capricorn-December 21-January 19 Capricorn came out of the womb as domineering, egotistical 45-year-olds.  “Hi, I’m a Capricorn and I’m stubborn and pragmatic. Pragmatic, that means I have the social skills of a chew toy. And, as an added bonus, I have all the emotions of a robot.” Celebrity Capricorn: Susan Lucci     Aquarius-January 20-February 18 Impatient and temperamental, the Aquarius is wacky in an eccentric way that borders on insane. The mad scientists of the Zodiac. Celebrity Aquarius: Yoko Ono   Pisces-February 19-March 18 Remember that movie about that girl that had, like, 12 different personalities? Sybil? Yeah, consider Pisces the Sybil of the zodiac. All the fine attributes of the other 11 signs rolled into one psycho head case.  Celebrity Pisces: Liza Minelli
