(Ahh, do you see what I did there?: I used the word "trying" as a verb, and then pretended that someone else implied that it was used as an adjective.  Ahhhh!)  Anyway, so when I went out, I said to myself, "Self, why not just run until you really feel like you have to stop, instead of adhering rigidly to this schedule?"  So I did.  And I ran for 6 minutes.  Now, I wasn't really all that tired after 6 minutes (compared to the last 6 minutes I did, anyway).  It's not my legs that complain, and I don't get cramps in my sides or anything.  The main problem that makes me have to stop is my chest/lungs aching.  I've always been this way and thought it was normal, but  urlLink this page says it's not .  Hmmm.  So I had to walk for 2 minutes until my lungs stopped aching, then I did 4 minutes running again, then 2 minutes walking, then the final 6 minutes running.  If you're thinking that a full 20 minutes of running shouldn't be that hard to achieve, remember that I've been totally,  totally  inactive for a year.
