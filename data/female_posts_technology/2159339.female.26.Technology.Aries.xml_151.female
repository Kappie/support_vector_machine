One I liked to do was "freshening up on a date." I'd never been on a date before, but I imagined it involved dinner. To me then, dinner equalled breath putrefaction which could not be conducive to the "I had a really nice time" kiss, which was the point of the date, in my young perverted mind. After me and my suitor would eat dinner of 9-spice roast chicken at my mom's restaurant, I'd excuse myself to use the bathroom. Conveniently tucked in my purse would be a travel-size toothbrush, mini toothpaste, some floss and mini Scope mouthwash. I'd brush my teeth with lightning speed, floss, and freshen my breath in the same amount of time it takes to pee.   I'd emerge from the restroom with fragrant breath, which would floor my suitor. "What wonderful breath, we must kiss!" he'd think. We'd kiss and live happily ever after.   Flash forward 15 years later: Batty Apple has complete disregard for the condition of her breath. She ignores sound advice and regularly chomps down on onions, garlic, scallions and other yummy but vicious delights. She eschews gum and minty candies to keep boys at bay. Sadly, she's learned that they're crusty-lipped mouth-breathers who will not sweep you off your feet but devour your cooking while hurling insults, then demand more food. They're no good for watching movies with, or gluing magnets with, or sometimes, even talking to. The only thing they're good for, it seems, is sex and footrubs, neither of which require wonderful breath.  What will be the fate of our young heroine? Tune in next week when she exclaims,"It's just such a waste that I don't like to eat snatch!"
