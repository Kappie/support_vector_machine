I think the thing I forgot to mention to my chiropractor(s) is the fact that the hip pain is constant. It doesn't go away completely. It's worse during walking or when I have to use the left leg as the load bearing leg.  Last night after eating a carb rich dinner of micro meal and chips and salsa, I decided to hit the greenway for a walk. I didn't get there until about 8pm. Temperature was perfect. Good tunes on the radio. I tried a little bit of stretching before I started on the trail. The hip still hurt of course. My thinking was that the walking would work it out. Then I thought, well if the jogging started it, maybe I just needed to jog a little bit to work it out. I mean it's a slightly different muscle use than the walking. Again I barely made it about 1/4 of a mile. The pain didn't stop. It got worse. And of course the opposite leg ended up with a shin issue.   I couldn't even make it through 1/2 of the greenway before turning around and heading back to the car. It was definitely getting darker at this point, and I had serious concerns about my being able to make it back to my car. I was walking very slowly, limping is more like it, and trying to nurse myself through the pain. When I finally did get back to the car, I cried because actually getting into the driver's seat was excruciating. I drove home crying and cursing my chiropractor.  Now keep in mind that the roomie is sick. He's lost his voice, has a sore throat, and is basically miserable. Has been for a few days now. When I got home he was still sitting on the couch. Me being in pain, I didn't care and wanted to lash out. So I told him that he and the other chiropractor dude could both kiss my ass! Well duh my hip still hurts!!  Just goes to show you that fear can make people do mean things. I went upstairs and tried to do more stretching and soaked in the tub. At this point I'm pretty sure that if it's not a hip joint issue, it's a torn ligament/muscle issue. It's not a good tight muscle pain. It's a bad something wrong pain. I'm scared. I can't afford for anything for anything to be wrong. And of course I'm kicking myself for not taking better care of myself.  I did apologize to my roomie for being such a bitch. I felt bad about that. He waved it off.   The thing I'm frustrated with, is it seems I'm being rushed through the office too much. I go in, Doc spends maybe 30 seconds talking/listening to my pain issues, doesn't ask more questions, adjusts me, and sends me on my way. There's no time for a better dialog to get to the heart of what's going on. I feel like I'm a waste of time because they can't make enough money on me. It doesn't feel like they care about me as a patient. I've seriously thought about going somewhere else. If my financial situation was different, I would have already.  So instead, I've done some self diagnosing. My first chiropractor (back in Charlotte) had put me in some heel lifts due toa leg length discrepency. I saw him maybe once a quarter after the initial treatment phase. I felt great. I went online last night and ordered me some heel lifts, they are actually a little more affordable than I thought they would be. Check out the site if you're interested.....  urlLink http://www.gwheellift.com . Hopefully I'll have them next week.   It doesn't make the pain go away now. It's something though. I'm about action. I want to participate in the fixing of me. Missy can attest to that! :o) I'll be taking it easy over the next several days.This means I'm probably going to put back on the 5 lbs. I lost. Of course it may also mean that I get some cross stitching done, so Melissa will be glad of that.  You know what hurts worse? Knowing there is no one to comfort me. No one to rub my back or give me a hug just because. No one to ask if I need anything from the store. I've heard the idea that men don't like women who are too independent. What choice have I had? I'm the only one around to take care of me. It couldn't be avoided. Isn't life ironic that way?  Oh yeah....I finished the Five People book last night. Powerful. Beautiful. Gives me something to look forward to.
