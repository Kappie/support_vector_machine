But Blogger has wooed me back, with one simple feature:  urlLink posting via email .  I can't even begin to tell you how helpful it is to be able to disguise a purely time-wasting activity as something potentially work-related.

Updates:  I have a job now.  Things I like about it:  I work on interesting and challenging problems, the people I work with are great, they just gave me a kick-ass computer, I now live 7.5 hours closer to my boyfriend, and last but not least they are giving me money, which honestly I was getting so  urlLink desperate  for that I really was not in the mood to turn down  urlLink another  job offer.  Things I'm not crazy about:  I still feel pretty unsure about how things work socially around here, I'm left on my own most of the time (which will be good eventually when I get more settled, but I feel a little lost sometimes), and I'm not crazy about the location.  Overall it's a really good situation, and I am happy here.
