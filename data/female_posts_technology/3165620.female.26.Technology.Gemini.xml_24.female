The dress ship date is approximately July 30, and it usually takes about 5 business days from shipping for it to arrive.  I can get the dress fitted as soon as it comes in, provided I have shoes and undergarments ready. This dress is nice in that I could wear a normal bra if I wanted to, although I think I still will probably go out and buy something new for the special day. I'm thinking maybe a slip to keep me from being paranoid that the dress is too sheer. (I don't think it actually is, but white undies under white dress do generally show through.)  Last time I was in the dress shop I had Buck take a picture of me with the dress pinned on, so pester me if I don't get around to posting that sometime soon.  On a side note,  thank you to Mom  for sending me a list of family addresses.  Thank you to Mom, Dad, and Kirstin  for emailing ideas and information. I'm sure Buck and I will be pestering you further soon.
