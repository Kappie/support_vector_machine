Still she felt this small glimmer of excitement inside which made her tingle all over.  She watched the sun move slowly below horizon as she ate her supper meal.  It was a quiet meal with her mother filled with comfort and peace.  Early to bed they both went in high hopes of having a good day tomorrow.    The door crashed open scaring Morrigan awake from a sound sleep.  She jumped out of bed and rushed into the kitchen.  There stood Aidan framed in the dark doorway for it was past midnight at the very least.  He looked frightened and pale in the darkness.  "What is it, Aidan?" Morrigan asked quickly as her mother came into the kitchen behind her.  "The villagers are crazed.  Someone blamed you and your mother placing a hex on their family.  They said they have proof for no matter the action they took they couldn't rid of the boils on their feet."  Aidan said quickly without pause for breath.  "The McKay family?"  Mother asked quietly.  "Yes.  How did you know?"  Aidan asked as he looked behind him before shutting the door.  "They came to me for a cure and I of course told them to soak their feet in warm water and the boils will disappear in ten to fourteen days."  She answered as she quietly moved through the kitchen.  "I guess they didn't follow your directions for they still have the boils.  You need to run from here for they plan to come and hurt the both of you.  They are screaming witch without just cause."  Aidan moved to their bedroom and started to put my clothes into a sack he found in a corner.  "You take Morrigan and run from the village.  I will stay here and hold them off."  My mother said quietly as she laid out a few things on the table along with a bowl.    "But, mother, why not come with us?"  Morrigan rushed around getting dressed and putting a few things she couldn't leave behind into the sack.    "I'm too old to keep running.  Besides I did my duty by raising you and teaching the craft.  It's time you struck out on your own anyways.  I don't know why you kept putting it off.  You are sixteen and old enough to be on your own."  Her mother wrapped a bunch of herbs together and placed them inside of Morrigan's sack.    Morrigan hurried to her mother and looked her in the eye only to find that she was taller.  When did that happen?  "What will you do, Mother?"  "I will face them with courage.  Now I want you to go.  I love you, daughter.  Blessed be and may all the gods keep watch over you."  Morrigan hugged her mother tight before grabbing her sack.  Aidan stood by the door keeping an eye on the village while Morrigan packed her things and said goodbye.  "I love you, Mother.  Blessed be."  Morrigan grabbed Aidan's hand and rushed out the door heading into the deep forest.  She stopped suddenly as soon as she was out of sight of the village.  She looked back to make sure they weren't followed before looking at Aidan.  "Aidan, you should return to the village now before they find out that you warned us."  "I can't.  You need to be protected and I am the one who can do that."  Aidan showed his determination on his face.   Morrigan sighed as she saw his forehead creased and his lips tight.  He could be so stubborn sometimes.  "I can protect myself.  I have the craft to help me."  "The craft is what gets you into trouble all the time.  What do you think just got you into trouble back in the village?  It certainly wasn't making candles or washing clothes.   Now we better hurry to find a place to sleep the rest of the night before they realize that you aren't in the house with your Mother."    Morrigan left Aidan drag her deeper in the forest.  She would go along with him for the time being until she could talk sense into his stubborn mind.   To my husband who hasn't noticed yet
