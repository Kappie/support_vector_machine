But not of fashion. So here’s a little court reporting, Valerie style. Bianca is finally looking fake/real pregnant. And who else but an anorexic, pregnant lesbian with a neurotic mother could pull off sideways, giant polka dots? Goldy Hawn circa 1968, maybe. Kendall is finally looking fake/fake pregnant. Her court wear was classic though.  Very Patty McCormick, 1956, bad seed. Greenlee, Mia and Simone wanted to feel Kendall up in the back room of the courthouse.  Sweet.   What’s with the judge? I’m scared. Why does Reggie get to come to court in his rap master clothes? Put that child in a suit, how cute would that be? Boyd has a new haircut and a new shade of lipstick. Both very feminine. I wonder if he is secretly wearing a Fusion color.  Mouth breather, Juan Poopie and Tad all have new haircuts. All very bad. But ok, bonus: Tad spent his holiday in the tanning bed. Babe’s channeling Brittany Spears and Krystal is channeling Daisy Duke. But not the Daisy from the ‘79/’80 series. The Daisy from the ’97 reunion show. Ew. What’s a cubra Libra? Apparently Lena fell down. She got a little rip in her sweater.   Maggie! Root touch up sweetie, trust me. Six weeks growth equal depth. Any longer and hello white trash. I’m not really interested in seeing Michael Cambais without his blue, icicle dripping, meat hook dragging makeup. Climbing out of the dump like a really sterile version of Carrie was a nice touch though. Ok, now Tad seems way  too  tan. He’s looking like Ross in a particularly wacky episode of friends.   What floor is the courtroom on? If it’s above the 3rd maybe Greenlee could shove Mia out the window. Simone could help. It would sure liven things up a bit.  Hi Mia? Yeah, you’re no Brooke Shields. Get your eyebrows waxed.   Long, detailed speech by Kendall’s lawyer about Michael being frozen, then unfrozen, then frozen, on a meat hook. In a meat packing plant. Yeah!   Sadly, Krystal saw the parent trap. She’s no Haley Mills. And Tad? Also not Haley Mills. Hell, together they couldn’t even be Maureen O’Hara. Ladies, ladies, stop acting as if mouth breather is a winner and or the savior. He’s a creepy loser. Notice how I couldn’t be bothered to mention Maria, her bodacious ta-tas and the whole Huey Lewis is in a coma story line? Uh huh,  exactly.
