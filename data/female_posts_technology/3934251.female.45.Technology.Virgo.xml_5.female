My daughter said we had a kite at home (how come I have no idea about the contents of my house?) so we decided we would go fly a kite when we got back.    It took my old man about 4 attempts to assemble the kite (which was un-opened on the living room floor and apparently had been for a very long time) and eventually he read the instructions and manged to put it together properly.     It was a pretty cheap one made of plastic and bits of wood that wouldn't stay where they were supposed to, so I had to reassemble it by the time we'd walked the short distance to the playing field.    Our attempts were pathertic, it kept falling apart. If I wasn't shouting at her, she was shouting at me, but I really enjoyed it. And the other couple on the field that had a proper kite, that actually went in the air, seemed to be having a good time without yelling at each other.    Now I am glued to eBay and hoping my bid of Â£1.25 will get me that easy-to-fly kite, only an hour to go. I'm also watching some more impressive ones and might indulge in one of those too - or maybe not.    You see, I'm well aware that if I do buy a kite then our windy valley will become the calmest place on earth. A bit like when I eventually bought the kids a sledge 7 years ago, instead of dragging them round in a plastic storage crate with the greasy old tow-rope tied round it, and since then we haven't had enough snow to stop a sledge grating on the paths.    Global warming? Nope, it's the items I buy that are changing the climate.
