On Saturday I was told by the landlord and the contractors that it would be done Sunday.  After not seeing any workmen Sunday, I called the contractor and he told me to call the landlord because some guy named Steve needed to be contacted about it.  So I called the landlord and after acting like he's all put out about it, he agrees to call him.  K, hi, not the property manager, this is your shit not mine buddy. I explained to him that if its not going to get done, I need to know so I can cancel the cable provider appointment.   I didn't hear anything back from him, nothing yesterday and nothing this morning.  So Comcast shows up and they aren't happy.  This is their third time coming to this place only to find out nothing is in place.  Twice for me, once for the third floor. So I call the landlord and he tells me that maybe I should wait until the cable is physically installed before making the appointment.  Gee, I'm sorry, I made the mistake of thinking if you said it was taken care of, it was actually taken care of. And then he has the nerve to tell me he is just as frustrated as I am about the situation.  No buddy, you couldn't possibly be.  You have a television that gets more than 2 staticy black and white channels.  The 3 bedroom windows, still painted shut, his remedy:  I  should scrape the panes to fix it.  Ummmm yeah, no.  Not unless we are talking about deducting more from the rent.  I took 10 days for him to get someone out to fix the telephone and the leaking sink and dishwasher, god only knows how long before the horrid patch job in the bedrooms on the ceiling gets fixed and yet I am supposed to fix windows too?  And pay top dollar for this place?  Oh I so don't think so!  So still no cable.  And no idea when.    Then B called and said they are talking about me and my position at my homegroup because I didn't show up to the business meeting this past Sunday.  Well, I didn't go because I didn't know about it.  Had I known I definitely would have been there but no one contacted me via phone, email or any other way to tell me.  Including B, who came by the new apartment this past Wednesday.    So I give up.  It is apparently one of those days.
