I prefer watching crime stories like “CSI” and “Law and Order”. However, when you are really, really bored, you learn to be content with whatever is available on TV.  Over the last few weeks, I have been watching “The OC” and I have to admit it’s growing on me. Maybe I like the show because there is nothing better on at that time. Not unless I wanted to watch some sappy Hong Kong drama. It could be that I enjoy watching it because I think one of the lead characters is really cute. In the end, I will have to admit it’s the love stories that keep me glued to my seat. There’s the misunderstood kid who is in love with the most popular figure in school. Then you have the smart girl who falls in love with her best friend, while he pines away for the sexier but dumber classmate. I thought it was really silly that I was watching a show about teenagers until later on I realized that most of the things they talk about are the same issues we face as adults. Maybe we may live under more complex situations, but if you think about it, I don’t think our problems with relationships change much as we grow older.  I have been talking to my friends in the last few days and mostly the conversation has been about past loves, past heartbreaks, issues with current boyfriends or worries about not having a boyfriend in the first place. One thing that I observed is that a lot of people seem to be dissatisfied with the current state of their love lives. I’m not immune to that feeling. Sometimes, I wonder how come I have not been lucky enough to meet a nice normal guy whom I can hang out with. But then, when I hear the stories of my married friends who have to ask permission from their husbands or wives before being able to go out with their friends or even before going on a business trip, it completely turns me off from the idea of ever ending up with someone for good.  It’s essentially a Catch-22 situation for me. I don’t like the feeling of being trapped in a relationship, but at the same time, I know I would never be able to handle the concept of having a fling.  So I go on and watch shows like “The OC” or watch the sappy romantic comedies that star Hugh Grant or Adam Sandler. It’s nice to daydream that one day I could finally be swept off my feet. But then I think the sort of guy I want to have doesn’t really exist.
