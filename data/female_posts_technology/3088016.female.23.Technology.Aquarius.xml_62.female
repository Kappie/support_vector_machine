If you haven't been on one before, the basic concept behind a pub crawl is to meet in one place (a bar or pub, most likely) and then rotate to the next designated place after an hour or so.  The Saint Arnold pub crawls are always announced with email messages that won't tell you the name of the pub, but give you descriptive enough information to get you where you need to go.    Last night's crawl went to: McElroy's Irish Pub McGonigel's Mucky Duck LZ Pub and Stag's Head  At the Mucky Duck, I played Wayne at Cricket (darts) and actually won!  It got down to each of us having to make one more, and I happened to hit mine first.  This is significant because I suck at darts.  Normally a game with my could last hours and most wouldn't even hit the board, but I was on last night.    We ended up going to 59 diner to sober up and to eat.  I somehow got into a conversation with the manager about their bread pudding and a to-go box of it ended up at our table.  I also remember trying to talk seriously about my new invention of the Beer Charm and how to patent this particular design, and we agreed to go in with a large beer company (like Miller, for example) and have little advertising charms on them.  We had the business plan all figured out.  I mumbled something about how our brains put together would make a great business.  I don't remember much else, though.  Wayne and I had the same number of drinks, but they hit me harder than they do him.  Some people get silly or excited when they're drunk.  I get serious.    This morning, I looked on the US Patent and Trademark Office  urlLink web site  and noticed that beverage charms are patented, but only for the kind that attach to something with a closed handle or a stem.  Mine are not of that type.  I have visions of this being like  urlLink that movie  where the guy invents a dog-poo disappearing spray and becomes filthy rich.  It got terrible reviews.
