He commented on feeling left out due to being the only one without a significant other and using his camera as a distraction.   Wayne and I were invited to a friend's crawfish boil, which always get a little wild and at which we have historically had a really good time.  We were, however, a little out of place this time, being the only non-Vietnamese people there (other than the hostess) out of about fifty people strewn all over the house and backyard.  We ended up sitting and watching Finding Nemo with the kids in the living room and realized how anti-social we were being.  The fun part was when we decided to mingle and the guys talked Wayne into taking several shots of Cognac with them.  Needless to say, I drove home.         I don't even like crawfish.  Some combination of the spices being too hot and seeing the little critters crawl around in a tub about an hour before they're on the table is un-appetizing to me.  Thank God they had great barbecue.
