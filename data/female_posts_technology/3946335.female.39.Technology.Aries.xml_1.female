The reasons are:     Having that info out there in the world is scary    Writing about it brings back memories that I do not want to revisit    No one is reading this anyway     Now, if I find out #3 is not true and someone out there wants me to post it, maybe I will.(But, you have to ask nicely.)    My niece is here, so I have to get going for now. I'll post more later...
