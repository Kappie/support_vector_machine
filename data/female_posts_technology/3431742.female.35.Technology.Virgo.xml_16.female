Here are some of the answers you have been looking for. I started cause I had to have an id to make comments on a friends site.  Since I was creating an ID and et al, might as well start something.  I wasn't digging the livejournal stuff. I don't have time right now to learn php or research all that to just start something.  I'm all about finding the free stuff and not re-inventing the wheel.  So there it is.  For those that actually read this, Waiken is going on a road trip adventure and ending in the city of sin.  Wish you good travels friend and hope for some great pics of everywhere you go.  Too much political BS and stupid people at work.  I've already told you about my great boss, right?  Well he's up to the same shit, different day crap.  He very much lives up to his nickname of "The Blackhole".  Getting tired of folks coming up to me asking if Scott told me or fwded the email to me about this or that thing.  I guess I have to take time out from actually doing my work to bitching about my boss and the overload of work. I have this part-time dude and he's been really great.  Introduced me to Knoppix and a few other new toys.  Some of the hardware toys I actually got approved and have now, like a 4 port usb hub.  That is so tiny it's really smaller than my phone. Still working to get some imaging tool since he really doesn't want it to be ghost.  Found  urlLink Epirium Pro   made by some  urlLink german company .  All I know is this shit is a bomb and would so help in a ton of areas at work.  Of course I was told to have the pick of software yesterday but I guess getting yesterday is not really an option. :(  Ok now for the Question you've all been waiting for. hehe If you had the power to fire those that you feel are incompetent for any reason, would you really fire your boss?
