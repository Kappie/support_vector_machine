Thro' my schooling years, I had been travelling a lot, so never got to really check out my school mates well enoughor make friends who has lasted beyond those years in that particular school. I had seen all my friends running around with their boyfriends, passing comments on the guys as they stood over 100m away, etc, but never could figure out what really makes a person attain a new height of a "special" friend.  After very many years of pondering, keenly watching women and men go crazy over each other, I think I have come to a point where I can atleast contribute to this topic now..  So here are the 10 reasons I beleive justify elevating a person to a "special" person category:  1. Trust : This is not something which drops out of the heavens, and is a value which needs to be truely earned at each and every level.  2. Selflessness : Putting "you" infront of "i", this makes a world of difference!  3. Dependability: When the entire world has shut it's doors on your face, you there's one person whom you can always turn you.  4. Advicer : This probably be the one and only person whom one will be able to digest any comment, whether nasty, sarcastic or developmental. This person is always a constructive critic!  5. Emotional Support : Irrespective of the nature of the problem, however personal it is, this is the one person with whom you should feel that you at letting down your burden from your heart.  6. Meaning of Time : Time will not stand in the way of anything. Whatever the time, time period, this is the one person whom you can count on to be there around you.  7. Respect : Irrespective of whether the entire world shuns you, this person still holds you with all the respect, mainly because they trust you to no end at all!  8. Determination: The power being able to focus ones' engry to hold things in a particular manner, and the ability to strive from there on towards the goal post with you, is what defines determination!  9. Smile : As trivial as it sounds, a smile is something which is necessary to keep any relationship happy! The power of positive vibes is more than enough to scare away all those fears and stupidity from your heart!  10.Commitment : The ability to stand against all odd and support you in the worst of adversities, provides just that rounded touch to any relationship!
