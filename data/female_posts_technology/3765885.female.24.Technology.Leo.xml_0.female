Even a super hero has to make tough decisions. Even a super hero can be at a lost of what he wants and what he wants to do. Even a super hero needs to learn to trust and believe in himself. So do all of us! There is a hero in everyone. I truly agree with what Aunt May said. In life, you need to believe in yourself and in the things that you do. Decisions may be tough, but as long as you believe that you can do what you have to, and do it to your best ability, it doesn't really matter what other people think. The life is yours! And yours alone! And most importantly, do not forget your family and loved ones. For they are the ones who will always be there for you when you are down. For without them, life will never be complete! I still believe in this!
