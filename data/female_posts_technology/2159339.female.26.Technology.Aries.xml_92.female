(chkchkchk). This year, I didn't want to be so fucked-up-retarded about going to shows, but I'm on Day3 of a 5-day binge. Is it my fault that all these good shows line themselves up so neatly for me to knock down? It started Tuesday night with Beam/ Rogue Wave/ Kelley Stoltz at Thee Parkside, then yesterday night's Fiery Furnaces/ Ted Leo, both with my fellow enthusiast, W-gal. She's almost as crazy as me. Almost. I considered taking a break tonight, staying home, and skipping seeing Bart Davenport open for The Cuts, but I clicked on the Cafe du Nord website to read about the 2nd band, Duvall. They would determine whether should I stay or should I go. Duvall is made up of ex-members of The Smoking Popes! Jesus, I'm a dead woman. I am so dead. I'm going to this show, and I will be dead. Dead ecstasy.    For the curious and lonely, I'm going to South/Metric at Slim's tomorrow night and Coachwhips/Numbers on Saturday. Friday night I'll be skulking around alone, wondering what to do with myself inbetween bands, and on Saturday night I will guiding XX into the indie-punk pseudo-underground. You are welcome to join me. Come one, come all.
