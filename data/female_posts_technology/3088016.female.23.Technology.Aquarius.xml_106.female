Cicada Snack Sickens Man   POSTED: 9:15 a.m. EDT May 18, 2004 UPDATED: 9:20 a.m. EDT May 18, 2004  BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -- An Indiana man is learning the hard way that eating bugs can be dangerous.   Dr. Al Ripani said the man showed up at his Bloomington clinic after eating nearly 30 cicadas. The man, who wasn't named, suffered a strong allergic reaction to the sauteed insects.   Individuals with allergies to shellfish are especially at risk.    He had read a newspaper article about cooking the bugs and tried them with butter, crushed garlic and basil. But the article didn't warn that people with food allergies can also be allergic to cooked insects.   The cicadas are causing quite a stir across much of the eastern United States, where they emerge once every 17 years.
