I was like, "It's next to kale and collared greens." And the line got longer and longer and people were silently cursing my pink produce. Then after paging 2 people who didn't know either, he goes, "I guess I just punch in celery, cuz it look like celery." Then he spazzes out a little then goes, "No, I just ring you up for kale then. No one will know. Just don't tell anybody!"
