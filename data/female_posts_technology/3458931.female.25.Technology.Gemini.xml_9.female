I guess that means I'm back at work tomorrow, then off again on a four-day weekend!   I'm watching the Henry VIII movie on CBC and wondering if all people did back then was lurk around corners, waiting to overhear something they can use to further thier own ambitions. It's so much more treaterous than today; now we have cameras and instant-replay.
