Been wondering about some stuff in my professional side, and kindof getting some answers on that quarter now.  Its' kindof like a point where you understand where you are heading to and what you really want in your career.  I think I have finally got some sense of direction on this now,guess I need to now let a few things roll out and then I guess I might be in a better position to access my progress in my plans.  Had a very interesting chat with an old school friend of mine, he had kindof run away from the US after a breakup and come to India recently.  He said this really interesting thing about breakups and healing, in the story oliver twist, after the breakup, an old and wise man said to Jenny, "time will heal you", Later in the story Jenny says, "yes, he said so, but never told me how long it would take!"  Well, as true as it may be to the "T", thats the way love goes!  It's an addiction which can never be snapped out of, unless and until another addition overrides it!
