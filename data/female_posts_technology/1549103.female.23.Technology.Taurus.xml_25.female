I've also discovered that it sucks being a procrastinator AND a perfectionist, because then you end up trying to write a paper the day before it's due, but still taking the time to try to do it well, and ending up disappointed in the finished product and yourself.  Kant, the man whose daily walks were punctual enough for neighbors to set their clocks by, probably never had such problems.
