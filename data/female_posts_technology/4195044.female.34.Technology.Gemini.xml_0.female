(The laptop is doing GREAT *so far* by the way, no more of those scary symptoms!  Uiteindelijk !) Ohh, that reminds me too, to ask Dutchman a favor to scan our other holiday fotos...      Anyways, I got so hyped up seeing our Paris trip 2 years ago, Dutchman's gift to me for visiting him in NL. I knew we will be staying there for a week... but when I asked him how much my share was for the trip, he grinned and said, "  Its my gift to you baby!  ". I guess that was kind of romantic at that time since I didn't get any flowers!!! You know Dutch-MEN, they fall behind the romance department but this was indeed plus points! Doncha agree?          Crimee Metro Station          A candid shot! Didn't expect Dutchman will flash away!   I love the bright yellow color of the underground channel, kind of warm but sexy.         Cafe in Montmartre          Located on the same hill where Sacre Coeur church is sitting. Dutchman and I were kind of arguing if we would like to have a foto in this cafe. I insisted, hehe. So when we got the bill, we asked the waiter to do it!   I think he did a fantastic job!           Eiffel Tower in the Evening!        See the lighted Tower on top of my head. The lights go blinking for several minutes every hour. Beautiful, it looks like an inverted Christmas tree at night! Haha! Best place to view it from afar would be in Montparnasse building.         At the  Train Cabin restaurant.        That place was actually charming but heck, it was too small, even for me!        Sacre Coeur        Stairs going down to the street from the church... w/   Paris view in the background. Can you imagine going up and down with my heels!? March weather wasn't that great too, hence my umbrella!            Montmartre Square  with the Painters.    I tell you, the painters in this square should be sent to court for harrassment! They behave in fact like glorified beggars begging to paint or make a sketch of you for a fee. I had to hide behind Dutchman's butt! ---But, I couldn't pass the opportunity not posing in the square with these talented species and their art as my backdrop!
