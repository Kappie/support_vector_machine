My roomie had borrowed it from the library, so I was reading it on the way to and from Chicago.  This book is about a set of six medieval tapestries that are now housed in the Cluny musuem in Paris.  We got to see them when we visited the musuem at Cluny, so reading about them was very interesting.  I really like how Chevalier takes what we know about a piece of art and then weaves a story around it.  For anyone who liked Girl with a Pearl Earring, I would recommend this book.
