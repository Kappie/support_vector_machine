AYS from Iraq at a glance is threatening to  urlLink melt  away. Riverbend tells us that she can't blog because she is preoccupied with  urlLink observing  the shape, color and movement of the heat. Ladybird posts pictures of  urlLink Iraqis taking their clothes off.   urlLink Iraq the model  people tell us that the heat makes them curse at themselves but they are still optimistic.  Ok, ok, ok, we got it. It is very very hot in Iraq.  Here is my advice for overheating body situation. Take a sheet or a sarong and dip it in water. I suppose an abaya would do as well. Let the water drip, don't squeeze it out. Wrap yourself with the wet cloth from head to toe. After a while you will feel that you are walking around with your own private air conditioner. Keep it on all day long. You won't look pretty but you will feel cool.
