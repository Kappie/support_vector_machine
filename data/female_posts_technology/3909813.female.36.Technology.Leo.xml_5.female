Was my family so oblivious to the fact that I was a child and should have been taken care of? 2.  Do men think it is ok to stare at women's breasts, or do they just not think. 3.  Do I really look 36 years old? 4.  What do people really think of me? 5.  Am I a good mother? 6.  Am I a good wife? 7.  Will I get in shape? 8.  What will I do the next 30 years? 9.  Will I go to Italy? 10.  Why do people pick and flick? 11.  Why do men blow there noses in the shower? 12.  Am I loved by my friends? 13.  Will I find a career that suits me? 14.  Will I do photography for that career? 15.  Will my children love me forever? 16.  What does yada mean?
