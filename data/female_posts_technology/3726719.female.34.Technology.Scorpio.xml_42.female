Everyone should have a big deal made about them on their birthday.  Everybody should have a cake too!  There were some challenging times over the past couple of weeks.  Bad days, busy weekends.  Still, life is good.  In IMing Mr. D on Friday, he revealed that between work and play his weekend was absolute chaos.  Okay.  No big.  When would you like your cake?  Monday.  Monday would be good - I've got the day off.  Welcome to Monday.  I heard nothing from him all day.  I finally IM'd a message to his phone this afternoon asking about the cake.  Got no message.  Fast forward to a few hours later.  Hey D, how's your day going?  No big deal, day off, almost to my dad's for my birthday dinner.  Wha???????????  Okay, so when do you want your cake!?!?!?  WHY DO I BOTHER!!!!!!!!   I feel like a pathetic, naive, idiot.  I really thought I was doing something nice for someone.  And it doesn't even register.  Guys, if you ever wonder why women treat you so bad, this is an example of why.  Because on occassions when we've done something nice for a man, we were dissed.  I actually invited a friend over to help me eat the ice cream cake.  She's doing really well on her diet and declined.  Yes, I've sliced into.  It tastes terrible.  It's freezer-burnt.   FYI - when you order an ice cream cake, make sure it's going to be eaten the day you pick it up.  Between this incident, and constant reminders from my roomie that men are shallow creatures only interested in the few, the gorgeous, the skinny big boobed babes, it's a wonder any man gets the time of day from any woman.  Times of loneliness are preferred to being this disrespected and appreciated.   I just don't get it.  Why do we treat badly those who treat us kindest?????????    What human mechanism started that bull!?!?!?!?  If you sensed anger, you're right.  If you sensed disappointment, you're right.  If you sensed broken hearted hurt feelings, bingo.  All of the above.  Sigh....
