When I was at school and elsewhere, I felt like a bit of an outsider because it seemed I was in a place few could help me, except for the instructors. Finally, I walked into a room and for the first time, I felt like the baby in the group. It's been exhilarating, the combined energy just catapulted everyone up several levels. I suspect we're weeks to even months ahead of where we would be had we been working alone. I've also, finally, hooked into an awesome network of craniosacral therapists so hopefully, from now on, I'll be able to get more regular work done.  Prior to class, I quit most other forms of healthcare maintenance I was doing, except acupuncture. No chiropractic for three months, no rolfing for over a month, no other craniosacral work for two months; needless to say I was a wreck by the time I walked in that classroom. (The things I do in the name of research!) I'd mixed so many different modalities that when my health improved it was impossible to tell which modality or modalities were responsible for the improvement. I knew enough to know the chiropractic alone wasn't successful; moving the bones without working on the soft tissue meant I was forever going in for adjustments, with small improvements coming over the course of months with no end in sight. But I honestly didn't know if craniosacral therapy alone was sufficient, and I wanted to find that out this weekend.  Prior to class I knew enough to start practicing on myself. I tried and tried and tried to palpate my own cranial rhythms. I did get to a point where I noticed this weird undulation, but wasn't sure what it was and certainly didn't know enough to tell what direction it was going and what it was doing. I know  some people think it's a sham, and I was open enough to that being a possibility; another possible option was that I didn't have the sensitivity to palpate this. I'd seen articles rebutting the idea of craniosacral rhythms because when they did tests, practitioners couldn't seem to agree on the rhythms objectively.  First day we got in there, and luckily with the background work I did, I could at least admit I felt something. And surprisingly, about 75% of the class felt something. We have a remarkably eclectic group. Mostly LMTs, a small group still in school, two (including me) who had just passed the nationals recently, a microbiologist/violinist, computer science/pianist veteran (me), a woman who was an airline mechanic with a reputation as The go-to person for air conditioning and fuel systems, a critical care nurse, PTs, occupational therapists, etc etc.  Luckily I bring my laptop to class and take notes in real time (I've used UNIX since the mid-70's when I was in 7th grade, so I've been using vi or a pre-variant of vi since then, and between that and the piano skills I can type fast enough to keep up with conversations, certainly a lot faster than I can write). Most of my classmates are, at this point, suffering from information overload. Also, if the instructor starts spewing, the only thing they can do is put their pens down, listen, and hope they retain some of the info. I'm able to keep up. I've picked up a lot, but I've also been a lot less stressed out because if I forget anything, I know I can simply go back and read the transcripts again. But I admit I'm probably driving the instructor batty. :P She most likely thinks I'm not listening to her while she talks, but I am. And, I can look at her the entire time while I type; I never have to look at the keyboard except for occasionally to do a sanity check to make sure my hands didn't shift one key. Reading the notes is challenging enough; having to solve a cryptogram before reading the notes - no way.  My first day was a challenge; at our school we got a good foundation in the basics of massage, but nothing out there like energy work. My partner was a student at Bahkti, a school in Safety Harbor where they apparently teach you a little of everything. So her main strength was energy, but not really massage, so she didn't have good body mechanics. As soon as she leaned over me and started working on my throat area, I felt claustrophobic and had an immediate, full blown emotional reaction. It sent me back in time two years; I was mortified, after so much work, what was I doing back here?! I left class that evening, bumped around at home for awhile and slept.  When I woke up the next morning I laughed, because I realize why this had happened. Even though I haven't had any energy training I've always been aware that it's around. And since I'm not trained I've noticed things like the fact I'm a sponge who seems to pick up stuff; I'd never really learned how to protect myself and the few tips I heard I thought... uh... OK... At one point when I was asking my acupuncturist for another craniosacral referral (because the first is very busy, plus she had a heart attack in Feb), my acupuncturist made some strange comments. Two other therapists work at the same office as the therapist originally recommended, but they're not as experienced. She said of one: in a pinch you could try her. But don't try the other person; your hypersensitive energy-wise, and she doesn't have very good energy; she's very chaotic and negative. I remember leaving my acupuncturist's office scratching my head because I had no clue what she was talking about. It wasn't until I woke up the morning of the second day of class that I understood, at a visceral level, what that statement meant. It meant this stuff exists, it's powerful, and along with that power comes responsibility. Tread lightly with respect. It gives me more motivation to keep working on myself (which I have been for the last three years), now that I know how sensitive some patients can be and what it feels like to be steamrolled on an energetic level. I don't want to give them anything inadvertently, nor do I want to pick anything up inadvertently. I need to learn to be just a conduit.  The second day we covered a lot - part of a 10-step protocol that Dr. Upledger came up with to help new craniosacral therapists learn and refine their skills, while also ensuring they don't hurt patients, and actually help heal patients even if the techniques aren't done quite right. It was a bit rocky but a necessary part of the learning experience. I'd already gotten a jump start - I had my rocky experience at the end of the first day. I'm sure other students were curious to see me leave crying. The second day, half the class ended up with headaches, nausea, dizziness, several emotional responses, and the instructors ended up doing a lot of grounding and showing us how to deal with these issues. I say this is a necessary part of the learning process for students because if they don't know how powerful these techniques are, they may take too aggressive an approach with clients initially.  The payoff was more than worth it. By the end of today, we'd been working on each other, and the instructor and assistants had been working on students with particularly challenging problems. The end result was by the end of the day, EVERYONE could feel the craniosacral rhythms because they were so strong. I realized the reason I couldn't feel my rhythms for a months is because my neck and occiput was so badly jammed. The instructor fixed me by using me as a demo, and after that I could feel my own rhythms. In fact, it got to be a challenge in the end - hearing my partner's rhythms and my own at the same time, and learning to distinguish the two. We heard plenty of stories like: my eyesight got sharper! My hearing improved. Wow, you look a lot better - your skin, you're more symmetric, your eyes seem more focused. Headaches, backaches, and pain disappeared. A chronic bruise at the site of an installed steel plate disappeared practically overnight.  And the icing on the cake for me was the afternoon, when my palpation input began to jive with my partners'. We learned how to push clients into a stillpoint, then wait for their systems to start up again. When my last partner worked on me, we both felt the rhythms and felt when it started up again. The same happened when I worked on her.  Granted, this is because we've all had significant work at this point so our rhythms are strong. But someone who walks off the street probably doesn't have a good one, and after only three days I doubt any of us are good enough to detect that. I've learned I definitely have a sensitivity threshold below which I can't perceive much. And that's what we'll all be striving to improve from this point forward. Fascinating stuff!
