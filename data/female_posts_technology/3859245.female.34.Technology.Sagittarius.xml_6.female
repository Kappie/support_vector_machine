We found these two sites that track the deaths of famous people.  It is weird to see what some people are known for once they pass. I always thought of Gordon Jump as the guy in WKRP, but no he is known more for being the Maytag Repair Man. Go figure.  So we are figuring that we are beginning a new threesome. We had Reagan, Ray Charles and Marlon Brando. Who will be next and why do we want to know? I actually have this funny little saying for Saturday mornings.  I get up, get my coffee and whatever breakfast I am going to have, I grab the remote and say, usually out loud, "Let's see who died last night".  Then I click on CNN Headline News.  Seems like a weird thing but frequently I will turn that on and find out some famous person died the night before or that morning. Do they wait for Friday night/Saturday morning to give the weekend news more to talk about than a week in review?  I am just as fascinated with the famous as a lot of people are. I know some people who are a bit overboard on it however. I don't find People Magazine to be any more reliable than the National Enquirer. People is the National Enquirer for those who can read. I will catch an episode of Inside The Actors Studio or Biography, even Headliners and Legends if it is someone interesting. I will even sit still for an E True Hollywood Story now and again. I don't know why.  It is theorized that we enjoy the lives of celebs because the seem so much better than ours. I don't think so. I have rarely had a problem that throwing some paparazzi, a disguise or a bad review at could have made it better. Is it the money? If you make a lot of money just to spend it on putting a fence around your house, hiring a body guard and renting out a restaurant just so you can have a peaceful meal then it is not worth it in my book.  Don't get me wrong. If I were famous and actually felt like I contributed either great art or great works to society than great, whoopeeeee. But I don't want to be famous for making a movie about fart jokes. (I will watch it, believe me I will watch it and laugh my ass off).  When you are an Audrey Hepburn and you die, your obituary says wonderful things. What will Courtney Love's obit say? There it is, the great art vs. the fart joke.
