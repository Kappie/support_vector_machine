I so wanted to talk to him..=( anyway, it’s still quite early and I hope I’ll be able to speak to him before the day ends..that is before 12AM..sigh..  Busy day today..we had a meeting at Daiwa Seiko Corp. in Laguna from 1 to 4 but we left early to get some tax return forms from BIR. My hon and I enjoyed our lunch at Jollibee Shell SLEX station because they had some leather couches..like the ones found in coffee houses..and it’s so comfortable, we even took some pics..hehe..we’re so mababaw talga.  At Daiwa Seiko, we checked the Biometric Timekeeping kiosk, trained the users on how to log for attendance, and discussed the revisions for the HR Dynamics software and the scope of the Payroll software coz sir eric already gave us the GO signal to start the project..yay! tess (the payroll staff) is so nice..we were delighted with her coz she learns the software fast, and she’s so kind and easy to talk to. She even shared with us the company’s problems with their employees when we were having our snack.
