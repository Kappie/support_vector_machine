Random Thoughts: 1. Shredded paper smells a little bad [nothing to do with SATC] 2. I need to taste a Cosmopolitan 3. How can women wear stiletto heels? 4. For that matter, how can women  dance  in stiletto heels? 5. Mr. Big is not that great looking per se, but he has this very strong appeal for me 6. For that matter, Carrie is not that pretty, but same goes for her with the appeal thing. 7. Do all men really fantasize about threesomes? I know my hubby has. 8. How many normal women out there [meaning not kinky, nymphomaniacs, etc.] have done threesomes? And for what reasons? 9. Why did I have to eat that last oatmeal cookie so late at night? 10. Is it really possible to lose 10 lbs.  Seems so hard!   That's it...G'night....
