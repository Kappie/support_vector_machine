Apart from the regular every two weeks change in shift, daily problems of users at work, answering calls, e-mails, checking up on tickets that are not yet solved while listening to mp3s, reading Ximen  Xiao You  the rest of the gang fanfics and wathing a movie or series on my pc, there is nothing going on with my life.  So, what I'm doing now is trying to see whether I can still write. If I can still express myself well enough in writing in the English language.  If I can still make a passable composition about someone else's life.  Mine.  How interesting is that?  And now here I am, rice corned beef and ampalaya with egg and shrimp for dinner in front of me and thinking how I sometimes mentally berate myself for cursing in my mind when I should be like San Cai except that I won't be shouting "Dao Ming Si!"  I'd be yelling "What the FUCK!" at the top of my lungs from the rooftop of Petron Mega Plaza.  After a few minutes of dinner concentration, I wondered how a boyfriend of one year will take it if his girlfriend farted while in the same room with him.  Nice dinner topic huh?  Is it even possible that there's no chance at all of the girl, or boy for that matter, farting while together with his/her loved one within a year?
