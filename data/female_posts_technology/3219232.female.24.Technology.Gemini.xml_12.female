So instead of a good morning, it feels like we woke up on the wrong side of the bed. The thoughts that are buried deep in the recesses of our subconscious, more often than not, come out whenever we dream. We try so hard to keep them out of our minds through distractions but when we dream, these thoughts somehow escape the cages where we lock them in. Dreams provide us with a reflection of the truth about ourselves, our conscience, what we desire and long for.  Sometimes we use sleepto escape ourselves, our state and to pass the time when we are going through something difficult and when we are depressed with our lives. But it’s actually dreaming that forces us to face our own realities-at least it tries to. These dreams are either the opposite of what we are going through, which make them good, or they are nightmares. I only find the good dreams, which are the opposite of what our reality is, far worse than a nightmare. These good dreams do not inflict terror, but rather, they inflict pain and sometimes unbearable sadness. In our dreams, we get what we want, butwhen we're awake,we don't.So how can we escape when our dreams won’t even allow us to?  A dreamless sleep can only be possible through sedatives-well, at least in my case. The seemingly countless days and nights pass by steadily. It feels like being on a raft riding the soft waves of an ocean, drifting towards nowhere. The ocean feels like an infinite body of water. It’s a nice ride but it can’t last forever.  I guess no matter what we do, we cannot escape the reality where we find ourselves in-no matter how hard we try to deny it. Our life is what it is and we are who we are. We can always find numerous distractions and make countless excuses but where does that really take us? We have really no other choice but to acknowledge and deal with it. Once we do, then our good dreamscan in fact be true and leave us smiling when we wake up.
