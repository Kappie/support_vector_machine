Sure, he jokes about Bush, as well, but there seems to be something behind the Kerry jokes. Next time he has a political guest on his show, listen to his questions. Last night while interviewing Tommy Franks, his questions seemed to lean to the right. I always thought Letterman was an intelligent man...could I have been wrong?  Before Jay Leno took over the Tonight Show, I was a fan. Not anymore. As much as Letterman has been disappointing me lately, I won't change the channel. Leno's whole schtick consists of  taking cheap shots. I don't call that comedy.  Talk to you tomorrow...
