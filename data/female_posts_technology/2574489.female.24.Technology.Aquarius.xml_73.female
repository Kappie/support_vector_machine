Yesterday I asked my coworker B about his opinion regarding the fact that I was not able to get my car to start last Saturday but that a mechanic had checked my battery and did a diagnostic check on my car and said it was okay.  B is a car mechanic enthusiast and I was made to sit through explanations of spark plugs and what part they played in getting my car started, and how it sparks the oil, which turns the pistons, blah blah blah.  I sat clueless, but managed to retain the fact that I shouldn't have to worry about my car not starting unless it happens again, that it was probably vapors.  Thank, B.  On our walk to our cars after worked, he asked me how my day was, and from there I told him I was unsatisfied at work, I wasn't learning anything new, I was unchallenged, etc., etc.  He told me that there may be a position opening up in our testing lab, away from the phones and if I "shone" maybe I'd get it.  Thanks, B, but I know for a fact that M and T have been vying for that kind of position and they've been there longer than me.  B is pretty influential but M is his closest friend at work.  I want to get off the phones! But like I told B, I need to earn my stripes.  He did it for 3 yrs. before coming to his current position.
