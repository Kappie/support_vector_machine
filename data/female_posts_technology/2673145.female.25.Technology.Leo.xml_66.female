Since last friday, I slept at 4am over the last weekend to try to accomplish as much work as possible. And being a lazy pig, I'm surprise that I could still wake up early in the morning (well, not that early.. say 9-10.. hehe) to do work again. Actually, the driving force was to finish the work and go out to have some fun. But in the end, I got stuck with work anyhow.   I did accomplish a lot last weekend and went to work on Monday to debug the problematic cases. It was draining, I realise. Looking at logs, scripts and codes, understanding how it work, and where it has gone wrong, I was so tired by Tuesday and I can't help dozing at work. Hahaha.   However, I was glad that I was busy. Firstly, it shows there's still work to do, I'm not redundant yet. Secondly, there's some personal issues that I was trying to figure out, or deal with at work and being busy gave me the excuse to be with myself.  This world can be quite tiring. Having to deal with work stress, family pressure, peer pressure, society pressure. I should think about what is my passion so that my stress and pressure are good ones.
