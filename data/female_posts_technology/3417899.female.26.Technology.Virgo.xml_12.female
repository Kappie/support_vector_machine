To those who don't know me, I am sure I am the epitomy of depth and sophistication. After all, I am well-read, well-versed, well-dressed.  But to those who know me, I am just ME.   The books on my shelves include Freud, Tolstoy, Geoffrey A. Moore, and Bush. But if you look closely you'll see that "Confession of a shopaholic" and "1st to Die" and the most worn...   The conversations I have with fellow business executives over lunch cover topics such as world politics, the flailing economy and the outsourcing of jobs - but I am only really enthusiastic when I discuss "American Idol" or "The Apprentice" with friends.      Mom was telling me about a Brith she attended. She met our neighrbors and old friends from the neighborhood (Old saps who judge people by the money in their bank accounts and the make of their car). I haven't seen any of them (or their sons/daughter of my age) in at least 6-7 years.  I have nothing to do with them.  And yet - I wanted to make sure they knew that I had MADE IT. It was important to me that they know I have become a somebody (have I?)   "Did you tell them - I got married?  I live in the US?  I am a Director at my company?  I make lots of money?..."  "I hope you didn't tell them -  I never completed my University degree I gained so much weight I don't have an apartment yet..."  Why do I care?   SHALLOW.
