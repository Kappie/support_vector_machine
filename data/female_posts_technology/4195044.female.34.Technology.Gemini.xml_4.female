The couple is in their late 50’s and have lived together for quite some time… that when they announced the wedding, everyone in the family was surprised!  The Netherlands is… how I describe as “A  Matured Liberal  but  Socialist Country ”. Partnership relationships have become a trend in the 20th century offering the same semblance and privileges as any marriage bonded. In fact if you ask a Dutch if he/she would like to marry? The answer would be: ”  MARRY? Why?   * eyebrows raised *   That’s just expenses  ”! For a Dutch, there is plainly NO distinction between being married and living together.  We arrived at   St. Nikolas Kerk   (St. Nicholas Church) in   Jutphaas  ,   Nieuwegein   slightly before 2PM and a sizable crowd was already gathered outside. The usual 3 kisses went flying in the air and embarrassing enough, some I have no clue who I kissed! What to do? Dutchman has so many relatives!  The whole church wedding came as a  Seal  of  Revelation  to me.  There was NO wedding march song. NO red carpet in the isle. NO flowers. The beautiful antiquated church stood there void of any embellishment, of any hint of marital binding. The bride was dressed in an untraditional garb, NO wedding dress but a white pant suit! NO entourage and if I may explain that… that means literally as NO bridesmaids, NO groomsmen, NO maid of honor, NO ring bearer, NO flower girls. Yes NO flashy train following the couple around!  The groom was NOT waiting in the altar but instead the couple together with the priest went down the isle to the altar. Interesting huh?  The homily went on to focus of their past lives, both having met in a support group for having lost a loved one. One can only imagine from afar how  loss  can metamorphose into  gain . In their case, it did.  Cocktails followed in an English Pub in   Vreeswijk   – a striking town in the south of Nieuwegein full of these undersized charismatic draw-up Dutch bridges. Dutchman and I have been here in the past, bicycling through. I had white wine, peanuts and some sort of Italian biscuits with herbs and cheese. And that was it!  The dinner, which in other cultures is fondly called as  Reception  – this is actually your chance to feed your guests, was  helaas  only for a selected group. The bad news, we are not part of that group,  jammer  hahaha! The invited elite are only the direct family members, and since Dutchman is a nephew - 2nd generation, so is he disqualified. I would even bet my € 100 if there was a wedding cake that evening!  How is that for a Dutch wedding? Quite practical (!), isn’t it?! Yes, Dutch culture at it’s finest!
