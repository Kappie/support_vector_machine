It also allows us to see what people in nursing home are thinking day to day. Seaver exposes the idea that nursing homes are very lonely, not very dignifying, and very boring.    All of these ideas go through my very own head at work everyday. I work in a nursing home and often wonder how boring it must be. Everything seems to be revolved around breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner, and finally another snack. Seaver’s expresses this when she describes her day of getting up early, waiting for breakfast and then pondering waiting in the dining room for lunch. Obviously she feels that there is not much to look forward to during the day other then the meals that are served.    Seaver expresses the idea that aides in a nursing home don’t take time to listen. I know that this is a fact. Many times, I find that we are very short on help and even though we would like to take time to chat, we just don’t have that luxury. I feel it a tragedy that we are forced to run around like chickens with our heads cut off when all these people want most of the time is someone to listen. I also think that people are encouraged not to get too close to the resident by spending a lot of time with them. I have had experiences where I was taking the extra few minutes that I had to visit with a certain resident who was telling me all about his kids. When I was spotted doing this by a co worker, I was told that I shouldn’t get so close. I didn’t look at this as getting close; I looked at it as caring.    Overall the feelings that are expressed in this essay are very much valid. I can not imagine having to live in an environment like a nursing home especially if I had my mind about me as Seaver does in this essay.
