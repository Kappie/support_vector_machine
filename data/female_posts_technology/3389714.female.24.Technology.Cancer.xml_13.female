There are 2 reasons that lead me to drink: 1) to wake me up in the morning 2) cuz it’s cold in my building.  I decided that drinking on an average 4 to 5 cups of coffee is well not all that healthy, and wanted to do something about it.  Tea was my solution…I went and bought all sorts of decaf tea…  It was not bad… I’d have numerous cups of tea though out the day and never felt guilty… until today…  I was up all night talking to my S mama (uncle),  I adore him and he’s really awesome for a 30 year old …I haven’t been a good niece lately cuz I don’t really make an effort keeping in touch…but yesterday we talked for an hour and a half…till 3:30 in the morning… keep in mind that I needed to wake up at 6 to get to work… The alarm rang at 6:00am precisely and I proceeded on fulfilling my daily morning ritual of cleaning one self and getting one dressed…before long I found myself sitting at my desk in intense pain… my head was killing me…. It felt as if I partied hard and had a bit too many everclear jello shots…was I hung over from having a conversation with my favorite uncle…it obviously is not a good reason to have this massive headache…so I decided to drink a cup of tea …nothing happened…took a pill …still nothing…then proceeded to go to the café and get a cup of coffee … took one sip and I was cured… the headache was gone ..and so was the nausea … I believe it’s all mental… but hey… I tried and I broke… I luv coffee and I’ll find a way of getting it into my system by all sorts of means including: a) oral application b) anal submission c) snorting though the nose and d) injecting though needles …nah I’m just kidding…I tend to eat these coffee by-products….1) coffee flavored ice cream 2) coffee flavored chocolates 3) coffee cake 4) coffee milkshakes, ect….what can I say I LUV COFFEE!!!!  Question of the Day:  If you were dared or promised a huge lump sum of money would you ever kiss a person of the same sex?  I think I would.. it’s just a kiss…however I would mind if the person being kissed was not straight…then I would not…cuz then it would just be full blown creepy…ewww
