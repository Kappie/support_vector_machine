Blue, it's calm and cool and mixes well with just about anything. 3) What season best represents you?    Autumn I think, even though summer is my favorite season. Autumn is more solemn and focused, where summer is more laid back.  4) What emotion best represents you?    Contentment. 5) What flower/tree/plant best represents you?     Not sure but it would thrive best in warm sunny climates, would probably be just plain foliage with no flashy overwhelming flowers, and have a mild but pleasant scent.
