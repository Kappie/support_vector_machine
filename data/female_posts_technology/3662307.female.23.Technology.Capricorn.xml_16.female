Told me to broadcast a mail to all asking who lost it....I found it amusing....I mean, it's just RM 7!!! Honestly, if I found it, sudah masuk pocket loh.....Anyway, i said he found it so it's better he handle it. In the end, it ends up in HR and a mail was sent out. I wonder if anybody claims it....Hmmm...must go sibuk sibuk in HR today....Wat would you do if you found it?
