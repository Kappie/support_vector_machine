Life is always greener on the other side, ne? I wish I was living in Mainland Japan. It's is absolutly beautiful. I've been to Fukuoka and got to take the train to Sasebo. I only spent three days there about a year ago and I want to go back!!!  Election time (Japanese senate I think) has come and gone. Thank god! No more noisy vans driving by with cute young Japanese women waiving white-gloved hands. No more Helicpoters circling around shopping plazas telling you to vote for so-and-so. No more pictures of old Japanese men on light posts holding fruit bowls. LAME!  Next rant:  American men who marry Japanese women. A cautionary tale.
