We don't have an itinerary, not even any real concept of how long it will take us to drive there. We have to rent a car, find hotels along the way that take dogs, make reservations, make sure we can get to these places in a reasonable time frame. We have to find a hotel to stay in while we're there, make those reservations. Bobby needs his tux, I need my dress. Then there's all the crap you have to do when you go on a trip - cancel mail and newspapers, turn off the water, get someone to keep an eye on the place, rotate lights, etc., make sure no food will spoil while we're gone, make sure bills are paid, shows are recorded, computers are powered down. Pack. For me, for Bobby, for the dog, for a two week trip, so much stuff to pack. Medicines, phone numbers, the laptop. So so so so so much to do.  And then my fears about what could happen while we're gone. The dog getting hurt, Bobby getting sick, being a thousand miles or more from home, from our doctors, from anyone who can help. Something happening back here, an emergency, someone breaking into the house, a fire, a flood. I don't know how to manage any of that from Minnesota. I need a list of hospitals, vets, emergency clinics out there, phone numbers of neighbors here. If something goes wrong... I don't even want to think about it. My anxiety is building just writing this.
