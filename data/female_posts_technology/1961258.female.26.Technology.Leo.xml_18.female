I NEED to get to 165lbs in 2 weeks at the most, not too far off .. about 3 - 4 lbs.   No workouts though .. horrible! Trouble sleeping lately but then I guess I should workout at night when I can't sleep, like I used to before?  Eating is so-so .. still have some junk food but reaching for healthier alternatives most of the time. Snack on pistachios, pumpkin seeds, almonds (never more than a half a handful), a smidgen of chocolate, granola bars .. what not.   My goal body .. is oddly a video game character. I play it a lot .. SSX Tricky, snowboarding .. and there's a character Zoe who's 5'5" and 135lbs and nicely muscled. That's the image I have in my mind as my goal body because it is acceptable, same height and all ... and that was a weight when I felt 'my best'.
