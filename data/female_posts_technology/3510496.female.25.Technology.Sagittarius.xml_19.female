Ever since then, I barely need my 5-fingers to count the number of sleep-overs (but hey, have to give us some credit because we shifted in barely 5 months). Well, its either:   - We are enjoying too much the comfort of having own home, privacy and all.  - We push major house chores to weekend, so we are VERY occupied.  - We are filled with Sunday activities like weddings and all.   I actually kind of miss sleeping-over there. Even though hubby and I had to 'seek refuge' in the living room (my PIL's a 3-roomy), we don't mind at all. A weekend there means filled with visiting his next-door aunt and playtime with his lil' nieces. There were occasional after-midnight-hunting of mangoes around Tampines (police Alert-NOT, please) neighbourhood with hubby, PIL and PIL's fun-loving neighbors. At times, in the wee of night, when hunger suddenly pang on us, we will just hop on and drive for suppers at Changi Village or Simpang Bedok. And not forgetting the  'makan angin'  session usually after supper, either @ Changi Beach or @ outside runways of Changi Airport, tocatch the thrills ofplanes take-off with bags of  kuah-chee .     During sleep-overs there too, means, after Sunday morning wake-ups  , usually it's fun-marketing between MIL  DIL at Tampines's  pasar bulat (near Al-Ameen). I will be pampered with my favorite  tauhui/chinchau  drink and  kuih keria . And normally we ta-pao breakfasts like prata/thosai. Unless the guys are 'hardworking' enough, then we will  brekkie  down there itself.   We do invite PIL to sleep-over @ ours. So far they only did twice. But we sense very well, they will miss their Tampinesian gang. Basically, in Woodlands the mood seems only reserve for eat, watch TV/DVD/VCD, chit-chatand sleep. Perhaps the mood will be better if we have 'little ones' running around. Hahahhh!   Anyway, this coming Saturday, most probably we are sleeping-over @ PIL's, not merely normal-visiting, sleep-over, ok! After such a long-hiatus-of-sleep-over, since before we went off for umrah. Aren't I such a dear DIL? Hihihih ...
