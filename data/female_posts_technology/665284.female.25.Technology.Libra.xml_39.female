What if I just hide under my bed, all scared and helpless? Or what if I just become pathetic? Hanging out at the old Slayer's home, talking people's ears off about my glory days, showing them Mr. Pointy, the stake I had bronzed.     ANGEL:   Buffy, you could never be helpless or boring, not even if you tried.    BUFFY:  Don't be so sure. Before I was the Slayer, I was... Well, I, I don't wanna say shallow, but... Let's say a certain person, who will remain nameless, we'll just call her Spordelia, looked like a classical philosopher next to me. Angel, if I'm not the Slayer, what do I do? What do I have to offer? Why would you like me?     ANGEL:   (quietly) I saw you before you became the Slayer.    BUFFY:  (confused) What?     ANGEL:   I watched you, and I saw you called. It was a bright afternoon out in front of your school. You walked down the steps... and... and I loved you.    BUFFY:  Why?     ANGEL:   'Cause I could see your heart. You held it before you for everyone to see. And I worried that it would be bruised or torn. And more than anything in my life I wanted to keep it safe... to warm it with my own.    BUFFY:  That's beautiful. Or taken literally, incredibly gross.     ANGEL:   (grimacing) I was just thinking that, too.
