To right the unrightable wrong,  to love pure and chaste from afar,  to try when your arms are too weary  to reach the unreachable star   Some days are filled with hope and courage. You suddenly have the strength to run faster, aim higher, think bigger.  Those days are few and far between.  Sometimes I think such days are preemptively given to us to recharge and revitalize. It's as if G-d (or fate) gives us the "glasses of naivete" and the bliss of ignorance for one day and allow us to believe that  we can .   Today has been one of such days.
