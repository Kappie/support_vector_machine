Why not put in a ramp at the theatre?  This is a question I thought of when reading this. The part with the bottle of urine I found to be unusual.  I also find I think the reason for this is because the public restrooms make no room and doesn't seem like they try to hard to accomplish a restroom for people who are handicapped, in wheelchairs or otherwise. The author grabs me from the getgo.  The high price of pay for handicapped people in wheelchairs, the usher being very rude.  This really was getting me upset and angry.  I can just imagine how he must of felt. I think people in wheelchairs are still human and need even more respect because, to no fault of their own, noone asks to be in a wheelchair or otherwise.  If possible, people need to be kind and generous and treat them with utter respect.  Can you tell. This story got my blood boiling because of the way in him being unfairly from my point of view. The part of the two attendants throwing him out of his wheelchair really is out of  proportion.  It isn't right that he was going to dump his urine here.  He could have went home but maybe he needed to so he could use it again. All in all, the story just got me upset with the handicapped being treated unfairly, in every respect.
