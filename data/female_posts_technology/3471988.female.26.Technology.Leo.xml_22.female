We don't realize it because its so normal for us. But in Indian Hindi movies or television shows they don't show very much affection between the opposite sex. If they do, its quick kisses on the lips and there is no emphasis on the action. American films just look so pornographic here. Those type of scenes really stick out. And it makes me feel like I am watching embarrassing scenes with parents.
