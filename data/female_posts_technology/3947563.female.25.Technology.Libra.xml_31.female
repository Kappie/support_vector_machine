My measurements, in inches:     Chest - 46 (Lucky Rick!)     Waist - 42     Hips - 51 (oh god)     Thigh - 30     Arm - 14     Ribcage - 39      I THINK my weight is somewhere around 245, but without a scale, I don't really know. I'll wander back to the Development area sometime today and get a firm number... well, its more of a flabby number, I suppose. :P     My Goals  - Lose 6-8 lbs and get at least one double in a game this year. This would require me to either hit the ball a lot further than I've been doing (which means I have to work on strength) or run about 30% faster (which means I have to work on running and losing some mass).     My Plan  - generally eat smaller portions (I'm a big eater, no pun intended), drink slimfast for breakfast instead of eating bagels, take a multivitamin each day, and avoid post-baseball game binges (Wings and Smirnoff, oh, how I'll miss you!).    In terms of exercise, I'm going to hit the diamond for some base running and fielding practice at least twice a week, go to the batting cage at least once a week, throw the ball around and walk around the neighborhood with Rick on my off days, and get back into weights. I'll also stretch every day for at least 10 minutes, hoping to be able to do the splits again by my birthday.   Along with my playing baseball once a week. I think that's a pretty moderate exercise scheme. I've got the advantage, too, that Rick is joining me on this little adventure. I find I have no motivation to workout unless I'm doing something fun, so the majority of my exercise will be in the form of baseball practice or maybe volleyball. Speaking of : I would like to see us get a HeppStaw Volleyball Night or two going this month as well!
