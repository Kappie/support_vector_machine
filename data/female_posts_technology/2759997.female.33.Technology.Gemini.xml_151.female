Been meaning to post this for a while (days/weeks - not really sure... it's all been a blur lately, anyway). Just thought it was a really cool picture and was reminded of it when I saw something about the blue moon on the news.    urlLink     This photo is from the  urlLink Apollo Image Gallery . If you go to "11-pg2", you can see all of the photos in the Earthrise sequence.
