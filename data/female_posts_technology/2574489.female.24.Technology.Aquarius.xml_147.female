This weekend I found friends on Friendster from years back.  Way back from my grade school years! I found  urlLink Melissa Ann , although she still has not added me as her friend :b (just kidding MeAnn)! I considered her my best friend in those days.  I found Joely, and Mary and a score of other people, even my 2nd grade and 3rd grade teacher!  I joined Friendster a couple of months ago but never did anything with it.  This is exactly what I wanted to do! Find my OBMC friends!  How cool.   Mine and hubby's weekend was very nice. Except for Saturday. I turned into an evil witch monster again. We went clubbing and everything seemed to rub me the wrong way and I blamed hubby for it all.  I don't know how he puts up with me. Sunday, we visited my family.  Dad, Woody and Jedd watched the Punisher, while Rhy, Mom and I watched Mean Girls.    I have to say that Mean Girls was funny, well-written and a very superior teen movie. I love Lindsay Lohan. I've loved that girl since she was in the Parent Trap. Although she isn't a little girl by any means, as evidenced by her ample, ahem, assets. I wish kids wouldn't grow up so fast.  My little brother is up to my shoulders now. Not so little anymore.  ***   Gotta love Coach   And despite losing only a pound since I started working out, hubby has rewarded me with the promised and long-awaited Coach purse!  I didn't get either the buckle demi or the tote.  I got the slim pouch instead.  The buckle demi was just too small!
