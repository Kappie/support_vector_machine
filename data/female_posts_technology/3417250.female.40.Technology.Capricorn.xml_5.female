This article is about the best breakup letters.  I think that the author was doing this as a sort of catharsis.  The following was my personal favorite.  You go girl!  (Please note, this letter is rated PG-13 for language.  Please do not read further if words commonly considered curse words offend you, or if anger makes you uncomfortable).  It is said that you write the first draft with your heart, and edit with your head.  I think that this must be the (very angry) heart part...  You chicken-shit loser.  I have loved you absolutely for such an incredibly long time, with every cell in my body.  Even my fingertips have loved you.  I would have (and did) put your health and happiness before mine you selfish fuck.  You egocentric twit.  But now I wonder if I really ever loved you at all because, quite frankly, right now I hate you.  I mean the burning, pit of the stomach, head exploding, shake your fist in anger at God and the universe sort of hate.  I'm talking about the stuff that taints your vision and makes the bile rise in your throat.  I would almost call it all-consumining.  Fortunately, I am able to use the word "almost" in the previous sentence.  You fucked up and luckily didn't consume all of me.  The part that you didn't get is the part that will lead me out of this prison of a valley and into the sun.  And the bad part is, that you are so afraid of life, that it is a criminal shame to waste such a powerful emotion as hate on you.  I can't even conceive of wasting the greatest of emotions, love, on you at all.  Where was my head?  For that matter, was I paying attention to my heart?  Was I just so sunk in to a low self-esteem abyss while with you that I wouldn't see the sum of all of your parts (or lack thereof?).    As you know, I am fairly agnostic.  It isn't as if I don't wish that there was a great benevolent being looking over all of us; watching our backs.  That concept is so compelling that I think if there was no God that we the human race would have to invent it.  It is so compelling to me that I pray that there is a god looking out for us.  These days, I pray not only for benevolent, omnicient god (note: neither works without the other), but for a release of your memory.  As much wonderful, beautiful time as we have spent together, I would willingly trade it today to be free of all vestiges of your memory.  If you were to finally come back around, even tonight, I would al last have to say that it is just too late.  You can't expect me to wait for you forever.  I stole "Hell Hath No Fury" (and I have to say that I FINALLY understand that one) and will wrap this up with more stolen words.  "Frankly, [insert name of choice], I don't give a damn".
