Lemme tell you some things about my Jazzy:      She prefers to be in sock feet, even when outdoors.     She likes fart jokes and Sponge Bob Squarepants.      I think she's a dog person, but gets along fine with cats too.  She will actually go to bed when she's tired of her own accord, something I'm not certain a lot of kids do.     She doesn't like strawberries, but likes my strawberry jam.   She got some treats today for being good at Gramma's this week. One of the things I got her was a pair of costume fairy wings; I snagged them at a yard sale for $1. She choose those wings over candy, clothes, and a comic book. She's been wearing them all afternoon; to the store, out for a bike ride. She wore them while we watched Peter Pan (great movie) and pretended she was Tinkerbell. LOL, she's definately my girl.       "what chu lookin' at?"
