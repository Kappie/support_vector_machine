Very impressed with The Vue. XX said they sound like The Stones circa 1960-something to 1970-something. I don't like the stones so who cares about dates. He probably named some albums too but instead of feigning interest, I tuned him out.  The Von Bondies were great. I liked their set a lot, though Jason Stollsteimer didn't talk much--I like a little in-between song banter. Marcy Bolen (redhead guitarist) is my new fashion icon. More about her later on in the week. Their set was about an hour, and XX kept marvelling at all the fashionable types in the audience. I said, "Honey, this ain't nothin. Wait til you go to the Arrow Bar." And he said, "When can we go?" and I immediately sputtered, "Ew! NEVER!!"
