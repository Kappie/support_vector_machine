I must say though, it feels dang good to have the laundry done, work clothes ironed, the floors mopped and vacuumed, Christmas lights hung and boxes thrown away and the dishwasher running.  Especially when its all by 8 PM.  All the essentials are pretty much unpacked.  I still need to hang the curtains in my bedroom but its not too big of a deal.  I feel quite accomplished although very tired.  Its time to go snuggle up with the mutt and watch a movie before bed.
