It was a beautiful service, candle lighting at the end and it really brought home the true meaning of Christmas.  We went to dinner at  urlLink Mikuni's , a wonderful Japanese restaurant that opened not too long ago. Oh man was the food good!  Came home and watched   urlLink Evelyn  , a total tearjerker, very, very good though.  I fell asleep during the second movie,   urlLink A Christmas Carol   .  Such a difference from last year's Christmas Eve.  I expected last year to be this big wonderful event and ended up being disappointed.  I expected this year to be uneventful and lonely and it turned out to be absolutely wonderful.  Today I slept in lately, went and saw a friend, her husband and their twins. Then my mom came over, we ate, I played with my  urlLink new video camera .  WOW!  This thing has SO many functions.  I can't wait to start recording stuff! Thank you again Dad.  You have spoiled me rotten!   This evening has been mellow and I am getting ready to head to bed.  Working the opening shift tomorrow and being there at 6:30 AM bites in a big way.  It's ok though, one early day and then a sleep in day.    I hope everyone had as wonderful a Christmas as I did.  Merry Christmas everyone.
