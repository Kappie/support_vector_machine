Well it looks like I temporarily forgot the plan as well. I had the usual for breakfast and lunch, but then for dinner I was like, you know what, I really want a sub. So I ended up having a sub. (Guess what kind, haha.) Large turkey on brown with mustard and veggies, no cheese. Of course, I got the chips for Ryan, but he didn’t want them so…I ate them. Sunchips, but still. If Mr. Sub’s nutrition information is accurate, my meal (including the yogurt I had after) was at least 800 calories last night. Yikes. Oh well, it was damn tasty. I went to the gym as well for 30 minutes on the treadmill, but I walked most of the time so I doubt I really did much good. Tonight I’m going to the doctor after work, so I won’t be able to go to the gym. Looks like I’ll have to actually get outside tonight and enjoy this beautiful summer day, haha. Remember when August used to be HOT?
