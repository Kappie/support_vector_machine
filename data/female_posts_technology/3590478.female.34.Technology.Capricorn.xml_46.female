No, that didn't look right to me either. We'll stick with my posse.) Why is that smart? Because with the unknown element you're never guaranteed refreshing entertainment. But with the known element amusement is assured. So, they kept breaking us down into interest related groups. There was the favorite food group (I went with Mexican and chose well as that was basically a discussion of tequila). There was the favorite activities group (I went with golf and scared all the sporty spices with my tales of gang fights and peeing in the bushes at the crack course).  And there was a "likes to get up early" vs "likes to stay up late" group breakdown which was lame. What about the "functions slightly above comatose between the hours of 2 and 9 pm" group? After group happy time they let us (or made us, depending) talk to individuals. One person came armed with a list of questions like some sensitive version of the dating game with Jim Lange. I should have done that instead of just opening my mouth and having the most brain damaged stuff fall out. ("Wow, you have really big hair. It takes a lot of nerve to sport hair that big. I like it." Yeah,  I'm sure  she's gonna call.) But while the sensitive dating game contestants' questions were deep and thought provoking (No, I don't remember anything specific  because,  hello ? Her questions, not  mine .) I think I would have gone with perky mayhem. Or surly and rhetorical. "What do you think is going through the minds of people who stop at signs that say keep moving?"  "Remember when Faith and Buffy switched bodies? What did you think about that?" And back to my favorite subject, "Did you notice  my  tube socks match  my  shirt perfectly? It's not easy finding-insert tacky color not found in nature here-colored socks you know!"    On second thought, dear god I should never, ever be allowed a pencil and time to prepare. (powers for evil, not good) The whole sorted affair, while amusing, was somewhat vague. I had to base my final choices on things like biggest hair, best rack, who drank the most beer, that sort of thing. And I forced my friends to write my number down on their sheets wasting a whole line for my evil purposes. In conclusion speed dating is just like that old rockabilly song that goes, "I got 99 chicks but they won't do what I want em to do!"  Piffle kiddies, Valerie          Faith (as Buffy): You're a vampire.  Spike:  Was. And as soon as I get this chip out of my head, I'll be a vampire again. But until then, I'm just as helpless as a kitten up a tree. So why don't you sod off?  Faith (as Buffy): Okay.  Spike:  Oh, fine! Throw it in my face! Spike's not a threat anymore, I'll turn my back! He can't hurt me.  Faith (as Buffy): Spike?  Spike. William the Bloody with a chip in his head. I kind of love this town.  Spike:  You know why I really hate you, Summers? Faith (as Buffy): (cheerfully) 'Cause I'm a stuck-up tight-ass with no sense of fun?  Spike:  Well . . . Yeah, that covers a lot of it.  Faith (as Buffy):  'Cause I could do anything I want, and instead I choose to pout and whine and feel the burden of Slayerness? I mean, I could be rich. I could be famous. I could have anything. Anyone. Even you, Spike. I could ride you at a gallop until your legs buckled and your eyes rolled up. I've got muscles you've never even dreamed of. I could squeeze you until you pop like warm champagne and you'd beg me to hurt you just a little bit more. And you know why I don't?  Because it's wrong.
