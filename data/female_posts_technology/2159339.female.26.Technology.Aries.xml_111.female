"Oh," I said, "So when's the funeral?" I accepted it matter-of-factly because he had been in a vegetative state for a long time and it had been a waiting game -- he had been dying for years. Before his vegetable state, about 3 years ago, he was completely senile, asking who everyone was. My aunts would ask him his age and he would say in all seriousness, "37".  Slowly he spoke less and less until he was eventually bedridden, eyes closed, and hooked up to feeding tubes.  Occasionally the hired help would turn him, change his diapers, and wipe him down. He mostly slept, and when his eyes were open, there was no trace of recognition: I didn't recognize him, and he didn't recognize -let alone register- me. So in my heart, though he's passed on, it's a great relief because I'm a proponent of quality-of-life, not quantity.   I really wanted to go to the show, but my date for the night was my narcoleptic cousin-in-law, P-diddy, who is goofy and lovable, but not trained in the subtleties of Vietnamese family dynamics aka keeping-your-mouth-shut. I didn't want news to trickle upwards to my aunts and uncles that I'd gone out the night grandpa died. In the game of family politics, this would be a disgrace to my mother. I didn't want to shame her so I stayed home with Abby and my roommate/cousin Green Marble and we watched a Chris Rock DVD together on the couch, each of us with a blanket over our legs like old men. We laughed out loud and sipped cheap wine.   I anticipate the funeral, because it'll be nice to see all my family in one place. Every single member. Though it's for my grandfather's funeral, I love being with them. I love the togetherness because, though sometimes nosy and sometimes bossy, I fucking love my family.
