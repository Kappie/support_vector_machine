[OK - I may be a tad too melodramatic here....]   I lost a deal. THE deal.  The big one I had been working on for the past God-know-how-many months. $350K.  Finally establishing myself as a sales person in this company, not just a youg wannabe.  Being the only salesperson to hit their quota.  All down the drain.  I don't quite understand why, yet. Don't know where the mistake was made or by whom.  And yet - there it was - my boss knocking on my door saying: The deal is lost. It's not going to happen.  (They didn't even call me. Instead they called my boss).   "You win some, you lose some", my father always says.   Today I chalked a loss.    Success is the ability to go from one failure to another with no loss of enthusiasm.  Sir Winston Churchill (1874 - 1965)    Win as if you were used to it, lose as if you enjoyed it for a change.  Ralph Waldo Emerson
