These are some of the more colorful things that were said to me.   You look exactly like an ex girlfriend of mine  You look very creative (this I heard 5 times)  Are you really a lesbian?  You're probably bi, right?  You know that part in gone with the wind where the daughter falls off the horse and breaks her neck? That is the best part of that movie.  You don't look like you even know what a golf club is.  You don't look like someone who would play golf.  Do you have any pets?  Do you like other peoples' pets?  Do you have any children?  Do you like other people's children?  Are you a top or a bottom?  I see you are hurry drinking to go along with the hurry dating.  What toner do you use?  You like star trek? Are you a geek?  Your underwear is showing.  Does the carpet match the drapes?  My last girlfriend was 20 years older than me. How old are you?     Whew! I mean, I know I have some social skills issues but jeez!  Actually, I am easily amused so all of these statements and questions were met with mirth.
