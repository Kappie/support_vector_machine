Like hearing that.  I know they would have trouble w/o me so far.  Read some rumors that the Batchelor party wasn't too bad; but then again, "What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas".  I still want to know the "dirt" cause I'm just so damn nosy.  The Grid was great.  It's very fast paced but worth telling so much in so little time.  It is pretty disturbing like it warns.  Julianne is so damn pretty in there and plays her character well.  Dylan well.... he's just hot and not good at this puppy role they gave him.  He should be commanding people or someone around.  He was pretty good at that on The Practice the few times I watched snippets.  Like when he's doing a strong character.  So the museum's special feature: The Quest for Immortality will be ending soon.  I went once already, near the time it opened.  I will be going again hopefully this sat morning.  I should be going one more time after that; if not, ah well.  There is a lot to see, you get all the time you want, BUT remember there are children there too AND inconsiderate people.  I hear that Mornings are better, not Free Mondays tho.  Next big exhibit should be "Pearls".  Don't know the details of that one yet since the Wings mag has yet to mention it.  Pearls might not run as long as Quest tho.  Well it's late/early.  I had a great question all lined up for you folks but it seems to have left this taxed brain.  For another day then.  I might just do a mini-time line of events from Summerfest til end o'vacation as not to bore you all at once. heh
