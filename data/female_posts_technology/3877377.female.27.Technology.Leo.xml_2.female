"Look, all I want to do is spend some time playing with my owner.  She finally comes home at 10 pm last night, throws some food in the bowl to appease us, and takes off again.  I mean, we didn't even get a hello/goodbye pat on the head!  She deserved what she got," claimed Gandalf.  Strategies employed by the two cats included playing with toys in close proximity to owner's head, toe biting, and hair pulling.  But the true work of art for the night took planning on the part of both cats.  Gandalf explained, "Well, Phoebe coughed up this monster hairball in the bathroom.  I knew that if I lured our owner in there at 5 am there was no way she'd be awake enough to clean it up.  And that she might even step in it!"  Their plan worked brilliantly.  While Gandalf was being carried to the bathroom for 5 - 7 am lockup, her owner nearly stepped in the hairball.  Since she couldn't determine what it was on only 1 hour of sleep, the owner decided against locking Gandalf in with the gross blob and instead suffered through two more hours of biting and hair pulling.  The night of revenge ended at approximately 7 am when the owner's alarm went off.  Gandalf took that as a sign to curl up on her owner's neck and act cute so that the owner could not sleep, reach the snooze button, or get out of bed.  Plans to prosecute the kit-kits are on hold pending a hearing at tonight's feeding.
