He hurried out of town before anyone took a special interest in his activities and followed. He called for the dragon as he entered the meadow.   Trellian landed a few minutes later. "So did you find what you were looking for here?"  "I am not sure. The barkeeper I spoke to told me about some rumors of Drakken and some guards from Zorlock and something about the elves and dwarves raising arms but he didn't specify against whom. There are a lot of empty houses in town but where have the people gone?" Bardric scratched his chin.  "Drakken?" The dragon said suddenly.  "Yes that is what he said."  "The Drakken are hideous creatures that the gods should never have made. There is no reason for them to live here. They cause chaos and bloodshed. They should definitely not be here because they were banished from these lands." Trellian hissed as smoke streamed out of his nostrils.  "I see you know some history of these Drakken." Bardric cautiously walked closer to the dragon.  "Yes I do. I helped banished them the first time and now it looks like I am still around to do it again. We must make sure that they are here first before being hasty." The dragon moved into position for the wizard to climb on. "We will search the area thoroughly."
