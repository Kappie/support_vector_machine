After setting this thing up I realized two things.......first,  that I messed up the name in my address....my original idea was "squareroundbox" ....but I quickly wrote it and typed "circle" in place of round. Both being the same thing.....but one sounded a tad bit "cooler". And we all know thats what matters the most now now don't we?  Secondly,  I typed the address so darn fast that I mispelled the word "square".  I'll bet you never noticed that until I told you though.  I didn't either until it was pointed out to me. *Sigh*    ~phone break~    *pretend jeopardy music is playing here*  Funny how quick the phone conversation looks to you the reader.  In reality it was about 10 minutes.   So pretend that was 10 minutes instead of the second it took for your eyes to jump down to the beginning of this paragraph.    Yesterday I skipped out on writing and since I am trying to be consistent with this I find it important that I rewind until I hit yesterday and play it through...skipping the everyday routine of...first I woke up...then I brushed my teeth...etc.  The sad part is....I do have a tendency to get into that much boring ass detail.   I'll try to refrain for the most part.  Yesterday my day started out with my 10:00 AM Negotiation Communication class. I have it four days a week and honestly find it rather tedious.  I'm not sure if it is the fact that it is in the morning or if it is the whole having to be social part that bugs me.  I think its a mixture of the two.  Then you throw in the fact that you have to "negotiate",  that just makes for some sweaty armpits lemme tell ya.  Four of us had to be union workers yesterday and three were management.....put the two together trying to negotiate wages, subcontracting, and union dues jargon and you have yourself some loud voices trying to talk over one another.  Today was better and we finally came to an agreement.  Next......I pumped myself up for a phone interview (internship opportunity) I had planned at 3:00 PM.  Got all my thoughts together....listened to some "Boards of Canada" mellowed out.  Its 3:00 PM phone rings....its Zane...yeah... kinda a cool name isn't it? Not cool enough for me to even consider it for one of my future kids though. Anyway, Zane tells me about the company....Zane tells me about the position....and finally Zane interviews me.  Everything went well in the opening and close....its just the bulk of it in the middle that I am a little worried about.  For those of you who have never had a phone interview....I suggest you have a computer in front of you in case you need to look anything up such as accounting lingo, especially if it is for a company that makes and sells tax and accounting software of which you will have to understand etc...that you should remember if you took a basic accounting class....but don't because it was years ago.  Also....make sure you don't ramble on about something only to get sidetracked and forget where it is you were going as well as what the question was...but become too embarrassed to ask instead just stoppping in your tracks and leaving a moment of uncomfortable silence and in this case....longwinded run-on sentences.   Not that it happened to me or anything.   Its just stuff that happens to other people I hear.  Just giving you a heads up is all. *hesitant laugh*  My mother and I went to dinner at the Grizzly Peak later in the night.  She finally wanted to use the gift certificate I gave her at Christmas.  Who better to share it with than the person who gave it to her in the first place.  The dinner was good.  But the dessert was spectacular.  Chocolate truffle cake with expresso ice cream.  Its gonna be at my wedding someday so come on out and have yourself a good time.  If you are not there to see me cry (gonna be the highlight)..then at least come for the orgasmic cake experience.  Thas right....thas what I said.    Or as herbal essences says it..."organic" experience.  But they have it all wrong you see.  Its the chocolate truffle cake that gives you that sensation....not the herbal essences.  Believe me....I tried it and it is false advertising!  BOYCOTT Herbal essences now!!!!     Went to Barnes and Noble after dinner  to browse and read a little.  My mom is on this Van Gogh kick....so she went straight for everything about Van Gogh.  I knew he cut off his ear....but I didn't know he did it for some prostitute he was seeing regularly.  Learn something new everday now don't we.   I can't believe that prostitute wanted him to pay up by giving his ear to her.  How desperate for food was she?  Diego Rivera ring any bells people?   That just about does it for yesterday.  Today was a lot less interesting since I fell asleep for a couple hours after my morning class, had to do some lab reports for my electricity class.....and then go to that from 5:30 till 8:30. *yawn* so not much to say about today.  Went by fast. like a current shooting through a circuit and me ending this post.   sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
