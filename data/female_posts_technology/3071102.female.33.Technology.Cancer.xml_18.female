Ok, so maybe I am going overboard, but you never know when it pays off to be too paranoid.  However, now I know that no one is really "watching" this spot will simply be whatever pops into my head... so be careful...don't be offended, or I will simply refer you to this post. It's the "as I am thinking it"... not necessarily, "I'm thinking this applies FOREVER!" You've all been warned, not that you cared, but this is my notice of my rambling mind!
