I realize now that all that smack i talked about her getting paid more than me was mask. i was really hating on her being anywhere close to me. she's locust, leech.  anyhoo, back to the stuff that counts in life... my friends and I went to the bar after work. i was only able to take down half of my margarita. i had an empty stomach and that made things bad. Then i totally forgot there was a birthday party i had to go to. Just got back a few minutes ago. damn eye contacts still bugging me. must be the wind. its so dry.  Got Paypal?
