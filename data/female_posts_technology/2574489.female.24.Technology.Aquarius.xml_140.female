I am saddened, disappointed and feel helpless over this turn of events. We Filipinos knew it would be a close call, but I thought GMA would pull through in the end.  I want to declare that this country is going to the dogs....but I don't want to lose hope yet. As staunch Catholics, the Filipinos surely know of the saying, God's will be done.  I am going to believe that this is God's will.  I am going to believe the HE has something planned for the Philippines, for the Filipinos, under the umbrella of an FPJ presidency.  Maybe FPJ will prove all our fears, doubts, criticisms, unfounded....We can only hope.  While on this subject, I would just like to say, to those Filipinos that could vote but didn't register, or were registered but didn't vote at all, shame on you. I wish I could have voted, but I'm no longer a ciziten of the Philippines.   For those who vehemently opposed FPJ, but didn't vote for GMA but for another candidate instead, you must have realized that a vote for anyone else lessened the vote for GMA, the only one who could have beaten FPJ.  That's all. Maybe some miracle will happen soon with our country.
