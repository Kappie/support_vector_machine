We're talking the heart of "that time of the month" and the cramps to go with it.  If a man, or a woman who has never experienced cramps, wants to know what it feels like, I can sum it up - cramps feel like abdominal surgery pain right after you've been wheeled out of the operating room!  And they don't go away.  They are all day constant - on average for 2 whole days.  So that was a bummer start to my week.  Let me tell you....it didn't take long to get a lot better.  You may have read a previous post...or two or three...where I mentioned the hip pain I've been having.  Well last week I worked with the roomie and Doc to get an MRI scheduled so we can see what's going on.  The MRI got scheduled for Tuesday morning at 7:15.  Keep in mind that I am NOT a morning person, so the fact that I volunteered to get up early and do this was a major step.  Tuesday arrived and I got ready.  I did my basic getting ready routine with the exception of make-up and clothing with metal objects.  I wore my cotton work out shorts with my a blue shirt and wore a camisole instead of a bra.  Perfect for a metal free zone like an MRI.  So off I went.  Ever notice how there isn't a lot of traffic on the road at 6:50 in the morning?  Me neither cause I'm usually in the bed or the shower!!  :0)  I walked into the imaging center, and of course was the only person there.  As it turns out the tech was solo as well.  When I got to the window he said "you must be here for an MRI?" and I told him he was psychic.  We got off to a good chuckle for so early in the morning, which was cool cause he was kinda cute too.  So I checked in, hit the potty, did the copy of the insurance card, reviewed some questions (I was concerned about there potentially being some internal metal with the tubal clips), and was all ready to go.     As we headed back to the MRI room, being the girly new home owner that I am, I of course had to comment on some furniture pieces.  Cute techie dude said all the women do.  We got back to the little changing room and I let the techie dude that I was wearing metal free clothing so I didn't have to put on the gown.  Thankfully the MRI machine was one of the new "open" ones so it wasn't too bad.  The only bad part about the MRI was the pain in my lower back (we didn't get enough pillows under my knees) and my arms falling asleep.  Note of advice - if you ever go for an MRI, just leave your arms down by your sides.  It took about 30 minutes.  I was uncomfortable because the back arm stuff.  Overall the process wasn't bad.  The techie dude checked in between MRI rounds and it all went smoothly.  So when the MRI was done, the techie dude came in to lower the table and send me on my way.  We were chatting about jobs and roommates and generic kind of stuff.   As I stood up to get ready to walk out, the techie dude told me that he would have the films ready for me to take with me.  Then he asked if I was married?   I of course said no.  He said he wanted to tell me how attractive he thought I was!   I said thanks and joked with him about how he could have told me that even if I was married.   Here's the part where he really made my day - he asked me if he could call me sometime!!!  I'VE NEVER HAD THAT HAPPEN.  I was so surprised that this cute guy would want to ask me out at just having met me.  He thought my surprised hesitation was going to be a no.  I told him absolutely not that it he was more than welcome to give me a call.  I asked his name, we'll call him Mr. J, and shook his hand.   J walked me back out to the lobby so I could wait for my MRI films.   Fellas, if you even think it, tell her!!!   And if you want to call her, ask her for her number!!!  You might be surprised and so might she!!  So I waited for a few minutes in the lobby (must have been the work out shorts cause I got checked out by a guy coming in for his own MRI).  J came out with MRI films in hand and walked me out of the office.  He again asked if it was okay for him to call.  I told him absolutely and that I didn't have plans on Friday.  :)  Gang I was walking on air for the rest of the day.  It couldn't have gone bad.  And J did call.   That night.  And the next night.  And the next night.   Welcome to Friday.  He's picking me up at 6.  I can't wait!!  Oh, and did I tell you he thinks I'm a hot babe!?!?!?
