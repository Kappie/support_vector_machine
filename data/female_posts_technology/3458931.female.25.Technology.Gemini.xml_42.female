I used to walk by this house when I lived on Needham and there were always cats in the front sunporch. I got to meet those cats, and the owners. The owners were super nice and talked a lot about all the work they've put into the house. It really shows, the pictures don't do it justice at all. This house is VERY fairly priced, and doesn't appear to need any major work (foundation, insulation, electric, windows, or roof). There is income potential too, from a small bedroom in the back with a private entrance; I'd have to share the bathroom but with a properly screened tenant I think it would be perfectly fine.    So I called mom and told her about the house, I need some help with a downpayment. I hate to ask because my parents still haven't been able to sell thier house back in Florenceville. I know they'll help if they can, even if they have to scrape pennies to do it. I really find them the most inspirational, sacrificing parents ever.
