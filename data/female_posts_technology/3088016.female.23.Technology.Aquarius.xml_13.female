This is in addition to our discussion the previous week about not having seen Pulp Fiction.  Apparently, I will be a step behind everyone else by not having seen them, as I will miss every joke reference made to these movies.  What a terrible fate.    Rob gave me a homework assignment to see one or both of these movies over the weekend and to report back to the lunch group.  I may actually do it.
