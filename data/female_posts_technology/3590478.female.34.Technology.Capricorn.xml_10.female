But she is in Ireland for 3 weeks and I am sending them out during that time and your address is on my list. After 3 weeks you won't get them anymore. Or, if your name was added to this list in error, contact me with a bugger off message.  Jeez, that was boring. Ok, on to the good stuff!  Twains, tonight, 8ish, excellent jukebox, $2 pints, Stella on tap. (Twains is in downtown Decatur.)  This 1st link is more wackiness with animals. When it first comes up it will ask you about some language translator (the site is in Japanese). Say no, it is way more amusing if you have no idea what is going on. Plus, in this day and age, who wants to download anything? You could get cooties or worms or sometimes that is how the devil gets into your computer and don't we all have enough temptations from satan anyway without the portal option? (I said portal, teehee.)  urlLink http://www.ne.jp/asahi/beetle/calcium/WANKO.html   This next link continues with my obsession with Shannon Doherty. It's a link to a site about a movie she made back in the 80s with Sarah Jessica Parker and Helen Hunt. (I'm sure many of you are big fans of Helen Hunt which is sad because once she finished up with puberty she also finished up with any acting skills she possessed. Angel dusted, Desperate lives, quarterback princess, these are all outstanding films. What women want is certainly no girls just wanna have fun. It's not even the Swiss family Robinson.) This movie was made before Shannon sold her soul to the devil, got braces or discovered the joys of having 2 eyebrows. And even with all that she was still a staggering mess. Perky looks so ugly on her, so unnatural.  urlLink http://www.fortunecity.com/lavendar/atkinson/470/index.html   This final link is to a young man I am considering making my next future ex husband. (Next implying that there were some before) But he seems too good to be true. Could it be fake? My favorite line is "11 ill songs, only 1 ill Mitch".   urlLink http://www.illmitch.com/
