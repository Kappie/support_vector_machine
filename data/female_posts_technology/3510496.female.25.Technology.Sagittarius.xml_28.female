I didn't realise that my drawer of tudungs has gone overloaded, until hubby complained that a few of my tudungs had seeked 'refuge' to the lower drawer containing his socks  urlLink   , singlets, shorts  urlLink    and boxers. Hmmmmm... that solves the mystery of my 'missing tudungs'.  I've divided the drawer space into two halves; one for 'lasak'-wearing tudungs (e.g. nearby places, marketing), the other reserves for new/current tudungs suitable for my working wear and outings. I've further sub-divided the plains and prints. I am very particular in matching my tudungs against my apparel, just like matching my footwear  urlLink    against my carrier. Very least likely you will catch me wearing prints top to bottom. Actually, having all plain is the safest. I believe this is the vainest you all ever heard of me.  The last group of tudungs I have I shall call it the 'glamour' tudungs.You know, the typical sequined/glittered ones, that's only suitable with your glamourous/exclusive kebayas, baju kurungs, pantsuits or abayats. All these I hung along with my shawl/dupeta in the wardrobe.  After spending solid two hours on 'tudung spree-cleaning' while waiting for AR, I am quite relieved. But still bothered with the remaining of Her clothes, His clothes and beddings in the storeroom. SHOUT out to him, "We've been procastinating way too long for that ideal wardrobe!!!"  ~~~  From tudungs, the word hijab will come across some's mind. Recently, my company's despatchman, Pakcik Wahid, 'present' me a book titled, 'Tuntutan Muslimah: Berpakaian, Berhias  Bergaul'. I find the book serves a very good guide for someone who intends to hijab-ified, or already hijab-ified. Easiest saying, it's a book dedicated to whole of Muslim women. In summary, the book explains on how a Muslim women should dress-up, beautify themselves and the appropriate ethics in socialising in various groups and people, based on Al-Quran  urlLink    verses and Hadith. Comes in 208 pages but is so portable due to its being pretty pocket-sized.
