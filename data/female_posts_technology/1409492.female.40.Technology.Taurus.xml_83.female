No, I have no idea what a chumscrubber is - someone who washes fishguts of the decks of boats?   9:  Jason Isaacs will be on 3 episodes of  The West Wing  which I have never watched. Guess I will this time although I have a bad feeling: he plays a photojournalist on assignment in Israel. JI has a bad habit of dying and I bet this time it's no different.    8:  Christian Bale is Welsh-born with English roots. Damian Lewis is English-born with Welsh roots. I am Kansas City-born with Welsh/French/Dutch/Cherokee/Choctaw/Blackfoot roots. Actually, I've known that last bit for quite a while now.   7:  My dad and Ileana have moved permanently to Oklahoma (where the wind comes sweeping down the plain..). They are building a house on the same property where my grandparents used to live.   6:  Damian Lewis and Kristen Davis are not getting married, it's just an unfounded rumor. They aren't even dating.    5:  Roger Clemens is pitching for the Houston Astros. When the hell did that happen?   4:  Some people are getting jewelry deliberately imbedded in their eyeball. I'd rather get my clitoris pierced.   3:  Amphibian aircraft use type 4 fuel. It must be true; I saw it in  Commando .   2: Yellowstone Park is going to blow sky high... soon... I have a feeling that this one is a bit of overexaggerated net rumor.   1:  Xanax = good.
