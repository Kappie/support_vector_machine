Upcoming live performances in the near future will only include few select dates in the U.S. Midwest and Canada this September, along with a trip to San Juan, Puerto Rico in late August. Specific details have not yet been announced. The new album will be recorded this fall for a release in early 2005 (January or February).   Via  www.punknews.org
