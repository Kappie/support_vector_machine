Nobody bought donuts in the evening. Well yeah, nobody bought donuts in the evening, but Krispy Kremes are a different matter!   When I called the branch closest to us, they weren't open 24 hours like I thought...just till midnight!    We went there and they had a steady stream of drive-through patrons as well as a sprinkling of eat-in customers, including us, who ordered a box of regular glazed (though there is nothing regular about these donuts), and a box of assorted.  What about my diet, you ask....what diet? Hehe....I'm tired of dieting. I figure as long as I'm working out regularly I'll be fine.   **edited to change "nobody bought donuts in the morning" to  evening ...silly me!
