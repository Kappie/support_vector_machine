FYI my treadmill habit is to run at a decent pace then go  urlLink balls to the wall  near the end of the run.  Chest and Triceps day: (3 sets of 10 reps each)  Bench Press  85 pounds. That's 5 more than last week, which was my mistake. However, I completed the sets with no problem so I'll keep the increase in weight.  Incline Dumbell Press  This is actually a photo of a decline dumbell press; I alternate declines and inclines every week. 20 lbs.  Dumbell Fly  10 lbs  Machine-assisted Dip  60 lbs. When I say 60 pounds on this one, it doesn't mean I dip me plus 60 pounds (I wish), it means I'm using 60 pounds as a counter-balance, making the dips easier for me.  Flat Bar Pushdown  I was calling these pulldowns before, but they really are pushdowns. 60 pounds. I also do a triceps exercise on the same type of machine with a rope - similar to this one except I pull the rope to my sides. I couldn't find a picture of that one.  Last night I watched  Dr. Strangelove . Despite the fact that I have seen every Stanley Kubrick movie  he made between  Spartacus  (which I loved) and  Eyes Wide Shut  (which was silly and boring), I'm not a big fan of his movies.   Even though I sometimes get the urge to feed my inner sociopath, Kubrick's coldness and dislike of people gets to me. When I am feeling down with people, I prefer  urlLink humor  or  urlLink horror  as an outlet. Kubrick's touch on horror was of course  urlLink The Shining  which I did not like. I think it boils down to his characters. They seem so far away to downright unlikeable. Even the most horrendously cynical story can be saved in my eyes if there's someone to root for. I didn't *care* about anyone in The Shining.  Dr. Strangelove, Kubrick's entry into the humor listing, I found to be okay but a little dated. It had its funny moments, thanks to Peter Sellers, predominantly. And I finally found out where the phrase "polluting our precious bodily fluids" comes from (a mad Air Force General tries to start a nuclear war with the Soviet Union apparently because he dislikes flouridation. Really).   Part of me wants to blame one of the scriptwriters, Terry Southern. He wrote a bunch of hip, ironic crap in the 60's and the 70's and being hip doesn't age well. Neither does irony. If you don't believe me, try to watch  Casino Royale . I have also read interesting reviews on  Candy  and  the Magic Christian . Okay, he wrote  Barbarella . Enough said about dated hipness and irony.  So in Dr. Strangelove, you had a huge glop of Kubrick's precision trying to mix with Southern's wit (General Jack D. Ripper, President Merkin Muffley, Colonel Bat Guano, funny stuff, yeah).  Kubrick's  urlLink Full Metal Jacket  is a funnier movie but now that I think of it, it's only because of R. Lee Ermey's amazing vocabulary.
