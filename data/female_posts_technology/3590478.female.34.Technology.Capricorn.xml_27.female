My 10 favorite. 10. Do your owners know you're out without your leash? 9. A little inaccuracy sometimes saves a ton of explanation. 8. I'm not bossy I just know what you should be doing. 7. Your opinion, while interesting, is irrelevant.  6. I've stopped listening. Why haven't you stopped talking? 5. Yes. It IS always about me. 4. They say I have A.D.D. but they just don't understand. Oh look! A chicken! 3. Everyone is born right-handed. Only the gifted overcome it. 2. Has anyone ever just hauled off and hit you? (and my number one favorite because, as I was recently informed by a shouted, unanimous chorus of "fans", I  so clearly  am) 1. Narcissism-one of my many good qualities.  I collect particularly offensive lines from movie reviews all by the same reviewer. This guy is brilliant. If I could write like him, well, I'd get beaten up.  A lot . But I bet I'd also make scads of money which I could then spend on collectible Buffy action figures, cheerleader costumes,  fees for golf courses with actual golf carts and hair extensions. And all that that implies. (see attachment for some of the better ones.)  Missing all the  preservative filled mocking goodness of the little boy and girl bands from the past? I know I am! I look back fondly on the time I strapped a bottle rocket to one of my new kids on the block dolls and sent him sailing towards the ocean. (Of course I was in Destin and more than likely drunk.) And the time I got a sporty spice doll and gave it to my nephew to play with. S. Spice had that great "I dream of Jeanie" ponytail, perfect for a little boy to swing around and then launch like a perky, British, eye poking  missile.  (These disturbing stories are endless by the way so I'll get to the point.) Now we can have those good times back!  urlLink http://www.hi-5us.com/  A museum of one my favorite things!  urlLink http://www.mtr.org/  (of course it's a distant second to my number one favorite thing-see 1. above.) You're all a bunch of colossal geeks, you'll enjoy this.  urlLink http://www.omwh.com/   Help me out here, should I be offended? (I think it's kinda funny. But then  I am a morally bankrupt narcissist so I'm sure I'm overlooking any social offensiveness that might be present.)  urlLink http://straightpridewear.com/index_static.html   Piffle, Valerie  Cordelia: "You're a lot smarter than you look.
