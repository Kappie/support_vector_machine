After I read this my views are open a little more to the thought that there are other logical, ethical, and moral issues out there other than my closed views.  Some thoughts that I found in the essay that were of interest to me were, "They didn't like the idea of taking up space in a world with too many mouths and too little food.", "They believed it was a misuse of medical science to keep them technically alive., "what they were turning against was the notion that there were no circumstances under which life should be discontinued.", and "life can beprolonged by science far beyond meaning or sensibility."  The one sentence that made me really stop to think about suicide is "The general reaction to suicide is bound to change as people come to understand that it may be a denial, not an assertion, of moral or religious ethics to allow life to be extended without regard to decency or pride."  This also lends me to think that what other denials in our life to we hold onto and attach a moral or religious ethic or excuse onto so that we don't have to face the truth?
