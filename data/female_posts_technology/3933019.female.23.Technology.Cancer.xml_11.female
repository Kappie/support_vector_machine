The GRE is a waste of time and money.I was going about my life happily assuming that i had a decently good enough vocab, then GRE happened to me. Word lists. Made me feel small. Very small. Miniscule. C'mon, who needs to mug up 3,700-odd words to qualify as someone worthy of a Master's...especially if it is a technical field? Ok, u ask me to brush up the technical fundaes i've studied in the last four years, fine. Might grumble a bit. Will do it anyway. Cos it will help me with my master's too. But honestly, what's the point in knowing the meaning of words which I -   > have never heard of   > can't spell   > will never hear again, unless someone around is cramming for the Big G-exam     > will never use or will see anyone around me use, either in colloquial lingo/technical documentation!! (ha ha!!!) Well, u get the drift right? I mean, i'm never gonna come across those words again. Ever. So, WHY???And i'm not even gonna go into the "Quantitative Analysis" part of it. Give us credit guys, if we are gunning for a Master's, I think our level of mathematics (or Math, if you prefer) would be slightly higher than that of a high school kid's. Hmm. Whew! I just had to let that out. Well,lets face it though. Love it or hate it, the GRE is here to stay. It's our only way out if we want our Masters.   And i hope none of the people who will be involved with my admission/Visa process at any time in the future will ever come across this post. It's a good thing i didn't put a picture on my blogger profile! Hahaha, clever me!
