I've been browsing the internet doing some research. Usually, when one of these needs to research hits me, it lasts a bit, so bear with me.    I plan on making a few posts on the things that I find. I'm looking, right now, for research material regarding the topics of science (specifically the Volcanology - an area of Geology), and classics (such as latin and greek resources).     I'll post what I find, then go back and review them (code wise) as time permits.    ~Nicole~
