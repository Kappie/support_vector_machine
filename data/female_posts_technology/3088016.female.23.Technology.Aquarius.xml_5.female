As I walked in today, another lady emerged from the stall in the middle of a phone conversation.  She then hung out by the sink for a minute or two and talked, then exited without even a courtesy hand-wrinse.    Do I need to enumerate what's all wrong with this?   1.  Always wash your hands! 2.  Why linger by the sink if you're not going to use it?   3.  If anyone ever calls me from the restroom, it had better be an emergency.
