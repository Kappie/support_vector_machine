I managed to squeeze a few chores and pamper myself with a great hair-cut yesterday before a meeting up with my L friends at a cozy cafe in TTDI. I felt like I need to help out my friend CC who was having trouble with her ex.. She's finding it difficult to move on when she found out that her ex have moved on and found someone new, a friend of hers too. The tragic things that happens unexpectedly in everyone's life.   Sometimes you keep telling yourself that you're strong and you're able to move on and live a better life after a break-up. I wonder if anyone can really really get over their ex in a matter of months. For me, it's NEVER that easy.  Especially when I really really love that special someone. I've always wondered how easy is it for my ex to just go on and have a new relationship with someone new after we breakup. It takes years for me to actually have the courage to get into another relationship although I regard myself as a strong and mature woman. I've always had the fear that my relationships just don't last, that shit might happen one day to break us up and that I might never settle down with anyone due to the reason that the next person I love will eventually leave me one day. Perhaps I have to change this negative theory into some kind of challenge.  This is where DC comes in. I'm thinking and challenging myself that I should just pursue this much forbidden relationship just to prove that shit IS GOING TO and WILL happen sooner or later. Just so I can tell to him and myself: 'I told you so'. The more I get to know DC, the more content I feel with myself. I haven't laugh and smiled as much as I did before I met him... I'm terrified at the thought that this happiest moment in my life will just end abruptly due to circumstances..  I HATE IT!    My heart aches and my soul screams for explanation from God when DC asked me:  DC: Tell me baby, do you feel for me? ME: Even if I give you my sincere answer, things will never change between us. DC: I know, but do you feel anything for me? ME: Can you answer that if I asked you the same question? DC: No...I can't. ME: Then you know how I feel.  But I'm sure between those lines, our hearts we're communicating about our true feelings for each other... Because the look in his eyes, it was just magical. I'd love to shower him with all my love, give him the best of me, showing him how lucky I feel to have him in my life... But I cant.. .And that just sucks....Nothing could be worst than this. I just hope my heart is strong enough to endure all the complex emotion and situation. I just want to be happy and that's what I feel when I'm with him... When we part, that's when my heart starts to cry... How do I justify the hurt or happiness I feel inside?     Perhaps time will tell and make things less complex than it is right now. Maybe I should start praying for time...
