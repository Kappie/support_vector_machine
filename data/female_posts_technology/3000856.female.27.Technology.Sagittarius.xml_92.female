I woke up this morning and could not even get my contacts in cuz my eyes are so swollen from sinuses. Man this sucks. Yeah I worked out after work and probably should not have. I can be stupid at times, but I need to loose my winter weight! Ewwww... I feel like a big fatty these days, and if one more persons says I am skinny I think I will scream! Ok I am gonna go back to work cuz I really need to leave early and go back to bed and get better.
