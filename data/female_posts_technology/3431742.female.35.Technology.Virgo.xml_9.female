In the mood to shake my groovy thing.  Plus it's free to get in. ;D  Saturday is  urlLink Lakefront Festival of the Arts .  I get a reduced rate since I'm a Museum member.  Sunday is Dad day.  Toast one up to John's dad and for those that are no longer with us.  I'll be with my crazy fam.  We'll also be celebrating my mom's b-day.  It's normally the 22nd but my bro doesn't have the kids that week.  Other good news: FIJI island has been picked!!  urlLink Here  read all about it.  Here's the layout of the  urlLink resort .  Looks like the dates will be: Oct 21st until 29th.  Isn't that totally awesome?!  Work is getting more heated in the HD area.  Too much to post here.  Thinking someone there or USED to work there, checks this out and reports to their somewhat spy.  It will not matter too much longer.  Lucky if the spy lasts til Friday with the way things are going there.  We're doing IT Email Moratorium for two weeks.  That will be interesting.  It will force people to talk to one another and get the different tones of their emotions across clearly. LOL  Question of fun:  What is more fun, an actual act of sex or the cat and mouse game of flirting with the intended/wanted person?
