Freedom is good, the 2 mile walks every morning are helping take some of the weight off of him (too bad the same can't be said for me).  I'm working on a few different freelance web design projects and as much as I try, the flow of creativity seems a little stifled.  My mom is going to Utah for a month next week to help my aunt after she has surgery.  The garden is growing very well.  This summer will be fun with all the homegrown veggies.  I honestly, just like knowing that something I bought in a little packet is growing and sprouting because of the work I put into it.    In other words....  My life is boringly wonderful.  :)
