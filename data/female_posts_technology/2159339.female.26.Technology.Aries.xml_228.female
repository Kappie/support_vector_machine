At noon XX came by in his truck and we drove over the Golden Gate Bridge towards Mt Tam. I'd never been there before and he wanted to take me. We drove up relentlessly curvy, winding roads and I got carsick. When we got to the top, I stepped out of the car, burped a few times, and was fine.   We hiked along a trail, dodged gigantic birds, and ate our sandwiches. I had to rest a few times because I'm unaccustomed to activity. We saw some great views and downtown SF seemed almost like a page from a pop-up book. It's hard to appreciate a famous skyline if you live within it and don't have the perspective to see its stately silhouette. XX pointed out San Quentin, the home of Charles Manson and the Menendez Brothers. It was so quiet up there, at the top of the mountain; serene and almost somber. We snapped a few photos, hiked some more, then drove home.  On the way home we stopped by an inn for some beer. I was wearing a tight white shirt and when I washed my hands before we left, I noticed that in the mirror, my shirt was practically see-through. And I wasn't wearing a bra. I hope this'll make me more popular with boys. It certainly made XX a big fan of me. ;) ;)  Afterwards I took a nap and he went home. At night I was going to see a show with LingL.   urlLink Sondre Lerche  @ Slim's 05-29-04    The opener was some Tori Amos knock-off that looked like Topenga from "Boy Meets World". LingL kept faux-requesting under her breath, "Cornflake Girl! Play Cornflake Girl!" Dude, last time Sondre played at Cafe du Nord, the opener was a Fiona Apple knockoff named Rachel Yamagata. Say what you will about her, hype her all you want teen magazines, she is second-rate. They both are. They ape their influences but then water it down to a bland state. It's like calling something kimchee when it's really just boiled cabbage.    The upside to this, is that when Sondre finally came on, it was a blessing. Thank the heavens that opening crap was corked! Save me Sondre! His voice is remarkable and he is such a sweet singer. And the band was the happiest band I'd ever seen, god bless those Norwegians. They grinned from ear-to-ear the entire time. All of them. They looked so happy to be onstage and playing music. They were having a ridiculously good time and the vibe was infectious. Sondre with band is much better than solo Sondre. He rambles less and rocks out more. And from the Faces Down album there's a duet called "Modern Nature", which at Cafe du Nord, Abby and I were quietly singing the counterpart to under our breaths, but at Slim's all the teenage girls were singing it loudly together. Not only does Sondre sound like Donovan, will he be elevated to Donovan heartthrob status? Is it straight from Slim's to The Shoreline Amphitheater opening for No Doubt? I hope not. He's so earnest and sweet. If he starts going out with Winona, I will crack his CD over my knee.   Here's a more comprehensive  urlLink review  by my favorite Chronicle writer, Aidan Vaziri.
