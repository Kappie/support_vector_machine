Home at lunch and it's a lummox-fest.  Teenage boys sprawled all over my house.  Eating my food, drinking my soda, suckin' up all my oxygen.  I asked them how the job searches were going and got no response.  Tried to explain the nuances of the budget cuts going on at my workplace - it was lost on them.   They are just righteously indignant and want to "protest".  Raging against the machine as it were.  Ahhhh, youth.
