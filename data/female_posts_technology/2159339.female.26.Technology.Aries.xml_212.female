He said, "Is that really worth going to jail for?" and I said, "You're not listening to me. I said that I would kill her, kill you, then kill myself! I wouldn't BE in jail if I was DEAD!" The worst part of this whole thing is that we work in the same office. I was warned twice not to "dip my nib in the office ink" but I dipped anyway because I was bored and horny. Oh well, this morning I have applied to three jobs so far. If any good comes out of all this pain and this empty sad feeling in my stomach is that I'm gonna get outta Dodge. And by Dodge, I mean Emeryville, CA.  For some sordid details, I will tell you that he said our relationship was getting too serious and moving too quickly. He doesn't want to commit to anyone and doesn't want to be anybody's boyfriend. Blah-blah-blah, yada-yada-yada. A lot of nice things were said too, but I blocked them out because essentially in my heart of hearts, I think he wants to sow his wild oats. He wants to sleep around some more before settling down. I may be off the mark, but that's what I feel instinctually in my gut. And he basically said that he doesn't like me that much.   Oh well. Sometimes I want to yell, "YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE!!! YOU'RE GOING TO REGRET THIS!!!" but I've lived and loved enough to know that that's just stupid. I've got some pride left. And I know you can't force someone to love you no matter how awesome you are or how much make-up you wear. And, if you do get back together, you will doubt yourself the whole time anyways. And you will want to hurt them the way they hurt you. I know all this. That's why I said he could still give me his CD burner before I totally cut him off. Who says women make decisions based on emotions? I'm awed by my amazing rationale.  He says he still wants to be friends and "get together" sometimes, but I passed on the idea. Because who wants to sleep with someone you're in love with who doesn't love you back? That's the shittiest dynamic ever. That's too sleazy for me; because underneath the steely glare and venomous comments, I'm a mushy romantic. I'm going to wait for someone who will be in love with me too. I think that's something worth waiting for.
