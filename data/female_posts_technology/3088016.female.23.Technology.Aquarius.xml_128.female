As time went by the hints that the night should end shall we say at breakfast increased.  Not that this is not flattering, but I got the impression that if he were with any female, she would be getting the same "offer."    This guy told me how if he didn't like the profiles that he read, he would sent them rude messages.  The reason he didn't like the profiles was that he felt that the women put in too many expectations.  I guess he couldn't measure up.  The rude messages would be like hey, you wanna get laid and stuff like that.  I knew at that time, his match made in heaven wasn't me.  I told him that I realized that he was a "sure thing" but that I'd have to pass.  Made up some stuff about hope to see you again, and bolted.     I don't know that there is a moral to this story, just that there are people out there that don't have them.  It's not that this guy made clear what he wanted, just that I didn't expect such a bottom feeder.    I am looking forward to a new and better experience.
