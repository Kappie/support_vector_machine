For instance, one copy of myself could work on the billing software that the customer needs ASAP.  The other could fix bugs that keep popping up in the clinics that are using the software.  That way, I could keep everyone equally happy.  I guess the question is how much time should I spent on each part of the project to keep everyone happy?  In the end I wind up juggling between maintaining the old and creating the new.  Two of me could accomplish so much more...  However, as I contemplate the benefits of being able to accomplish more, I am reminded of  urlLink Calvin's transmogrifier .  Maybe I'd better just stick to my juggling.
