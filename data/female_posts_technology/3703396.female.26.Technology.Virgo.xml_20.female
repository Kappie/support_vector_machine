I was dressed in my favorite outfit of black capris with a blue fitted blouse and my black sandals. My nails were painted to match for the occasion.   Then it was off to the surprise location to have our date! We drove for a while up Higley Road past the new grocery stores, past the freeway, into the heart of Mesa, Arizona. When I thought I could wait no longer, the turn signal sounded and we pulled into the  urlLink Broadway Palms West Dinner Theater . We had a very nice buffet style dinner with desert, and sat back together to watch the show.   The Music Man was a very fun production, and I'm so glad we got to see it! I'd like to thank my sweet husband, Andrew, for taking me out on an enjoyable evening. I had a wonderful time, and hope you did too! Love you!
