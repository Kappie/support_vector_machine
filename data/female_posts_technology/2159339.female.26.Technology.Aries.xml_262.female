First I had a strawberry yogurt in the morning, which gave me the worst stomach pains, being that my body refuses to digest dairy products. I don't even  like   yogurt, I have no idea why I did this. Now I'm drinking a coke, a carbonated beverage, another stomach no-no. My favorite thing to do at the office (besides talking to people on the phone) is taking tiny sips of cola, opening my mouth and listening to the bubbles crackle. I was doing that and reading today's Daily Dish about Britney getting engaged when one of the project managers decided to stop by to discuss upcoming projects. During the entire ten minutes that we talked, a banner reading "Britney Gets Engaged" was on the monitor next to my face. The fact that I even HAVE a job is remarkable.   In other news, M is lonely and depressed and calls almost daily to tell me this. On one hand, it upsets me that he's sad and makes me wish that I can do something to comfort him, but on the other hand, the fact that he's not having fun makes me feel better. He said he might come back for a weekend next month. The girlfriend me would have offered to split his ticket since he paid for mine from Chicago, but the friend won't. Instead I described to him of all the food I've been eating and places I've been going. So you see, I'm a masochist and and sadist at the same time. Have a great weekend the two of you.
