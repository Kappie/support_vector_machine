When I here sounds... on going sounds (like a motor running, or a constant sound like wind blowing from a rolled down window... constantly, my brain hear's the sound but "recieves" it distorted. Such as... you would understand it as...if I said the word "sixty" and you absolutely thought or heard it as "sexty" then it wasn't heard correctly. With me , I hear the central air kick on and it sounds like my voices get louder and twisted. A car passes by while I walk to work or ride the shuttle and it is awful ...at the moment when the car passes by it sounds like somebody is screaming the dumbest things to me. I have been so out of it...I haven't joked around but one day this week. I worked 70 hours so I guess that is the main reason. That will be one great check. I am turning this thing off for awhile.....Love
