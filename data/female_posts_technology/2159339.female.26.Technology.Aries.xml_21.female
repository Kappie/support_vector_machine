You think the lead singer will look anything like Jennifer Tilly mixed with a gorilla?  Whoo hoo! Another show, another sleepless night - will force self to drink caffeinated tea tomorrow (gasp!)  Before the show, I have to take my former neighbor Esther shopping. This Thursday, in addition to deep frying turkey, she's also making collard greens, sweet potato pie, corn bread and the best stuffing on this side of the Mississippi. Better be on her good side.
