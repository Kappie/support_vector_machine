Every week my mom and I drive out to Hayward to visit my dad, and every week mid-visit, I have to step outside for some air and some quiet. We usually visit him during lunchtime so she can personally feed him. Lunchtime is held in the common area where the big screen TV is turned up to a blaring rock concert decibel and all the residents ignore it. Nobody really pays attention to the program. I think it's used as a "Shut up" device. It's hard to hear and talk over it, so this makes people stay quiet. The last time I was there, the channel was tuned to this MTV-style show, all wacky angles and trendy music, with busty Carmen Elektra hosting a segment on the lastest fitness craze, Strip-robics. It was weird and sad and surreal to see these old, depressed, nightgowned people occasionally look up to watch Carmen Elektra grind like a stripper.  Perhaps I subscribe to the popular mentality that the elderly are innocent like children and need to be protected. But are they? I don't think so. To think this negates their sexuality and their adult consciousness. When the Carmen Elektra show was on, I wanted to shut off the tv to shield their innocent eyes, but one man wheeled his chair closer to peer at her gyrations. I was disturbed at first, but now I understand. Old folks, though enfeebled, batty, and helpless, still have sex drives.  Next Saturday, I am going to visit my dad again for a family holiday meal in the common room. I'm not looking forward to the mushy overcooked food, but I do look forward to being with him. He is almost completely insane... but this can make for some good laughs together.
