The twist is they got famous not as girls but as Drag Queens.        Funny and entertaining. No chio bus or handsome boys (well, lotsa well build gays) but the actors were great. Really simple plot but I enjoyed how they try to hide the fact they are girls.        It's worth 2.5-3/5 for the laughter.
