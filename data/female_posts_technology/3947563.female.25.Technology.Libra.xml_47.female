Friday Breakfast - um, I think I missed breakfast Lunch - Wendy's kids meal, but without the mandarin orange slices (they gave me fries by mistake and I did NOT eat them!) Dinner - 1/2 skewer of souvlaki (I wasn't hungry for some reason) Snack - raspberry sorbet  Saturday Lunch (who eats breakfast on weekends?) - sushi with miso soup and salad Dinner - Steak, swiss chard, red peppers Snack - raspberry sorbet and mango  Sunday Lunch - 2 bacon, 2 sausage, 2 pancakes (with butter and syrup), 1 scrambed egg, 1 peice of brown toast with jam, coffee, orange juice, AND A BIG TUMMY ACHE! Dinner - a little roasted chicken, rice, broccoli (from my garden!) Snack - raspberry sorbet and cantalope  You'll notice that I didn't put down any exercise... that would be because I really didn't do nything that would count as exercise except maybe going up and down the stairs at the library. I even went so far as to rent some exercise videos... but then when I got home, I found out that the cables to connect the VCR to the TV were still packed away in the basement and I was too lazy to go downstairs. :D I heartily deserve smacks, and I know it, but I'll get back on board tonight.
