That was a lot of fun, I met all kinds of cool people.  But I didn't get home till after two, which was kinda bad cuz Saturday DC, Michelle, Stacy and I went shopping.  We hit three different malls and were out for 12+ hours.  Man were my feet tired :)  But I got some new clothes which I really needed, so that's good.  Sunday morning I slept in...oops :)  Cleaned up a bit in the afternoon then went to the Vesper service.  Went out to dinner afterwards with my roomie then came home to watch CI, of course.  Worked on my cats x-stitch which is going to take me forever...but it'll be worth it, I really like the pattern.  Anywho, back to work now...
