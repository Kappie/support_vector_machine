If you take 2, you will sleep for 24 hours. That happened to my mother once. Tee hee.") and an inhaler and told me not to speak for a few days. Batty pointed out that I can finally relive middle school years, complete with glasses, retainer  and  inhaler. And this time I speak the english! Instead of taking the codeine, I cuddled it and my sleep and you know what..it worked. I have a positive mental attitude and willingness to take on new and exciting challenges. Yarf.
