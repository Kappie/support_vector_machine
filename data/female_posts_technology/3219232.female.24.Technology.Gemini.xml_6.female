I’ve always been in good company with Johnny B. He’s a favorite among friends, specially mine. Johnny B. gave a good hit after 3 glasses so I decided that it was time for a beer. Went to the bar and got myself a nice ice-cold bottle. My other friend took me aside and introduced me to a group of people. And without warning, my hit deserted me. There he was standing and smiling. He thinks that we’ve met before, but to me-I don't think I've ever seen him before in my life. Nevertheless, I lied and said the same. We had started conversing when this idiot former love interest of mine butt in. So I quietly left. I didn’t get to see or talk to him after that. He stuck to my head the rest of the night while my friend got drunk and threw up. I’m wondering if I’ll ever see him again. It’s been a while since I’ve had a crush. I've got a silly smile stuck on my face. It feels light, dreamy and nice.
