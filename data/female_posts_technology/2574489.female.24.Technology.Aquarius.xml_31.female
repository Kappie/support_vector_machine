They must have just put this up the past year because this time last year, I had searched but it still wasn't online...Here's my school  urlLink OB Montessori Center    I can still remember our anthem....Actually its kinda foggy now since I last attended when I was 10 yrs. old....but I remember the tune and the last lines:   OB Montessori Center For you and for me!    LOL! By the way, does anyone know Melissa Ann Maquiling?  Anyone?  Melissa, if you can read this, hi! Its me...if you're curious who email me at MrsHekmi@hotmail.com.  We went through the 1st-3rd grade together at the Sta. Ana branch.  If anyone knows her, tell her to give me a shout-out.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Okay I'm feeling nostalgic about schools.  I went through several:  K-3rd grade - OB (which stands for Operation Brotherhood) Montessori 5-6th - Blessed Trinity Catholic School (I skipped 4th grade, no I'm not that smart...it had something to do with the age) in Mississauga, Ontario Canada 7th-8th - St. Agnes Catholic School in Brampton, Ontario Canada 9th-11th - Notre Dame Catholic HS in Brampton 12th - Lakeview Centennial HS in Dallas/FW, TX  quite a move, huh?  If anyone know anyone who went to the above schools (except for Lakeview), shoot me an e-mail.
