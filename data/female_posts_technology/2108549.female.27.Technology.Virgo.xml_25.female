I'm frustrated with myself, my thought processes, my direction in life, my lack of... (not material stuff but inside stuff). I know that I have come a long way in sobriety.  I know I have come a long way this year.  Yet I want to be further along.  I want to know more and I can seem to learn it as fast as I want.  I want I want I want seems to be the motto and what is more frustrating is while at times that applies to material things, more often than not lately it is applying to inside stuff.  Stuff that cannot be bought or traded, things that cannot be bartered for.  I know, I have tried making deals and bargains and I don't seem to be getting it through osmosis.  I  know  its a process.  I  know  I have made progress.  I know too though there is still so much  more  progress to be made.   I want it all NOW.  More better more different more now.
