However, he accidentally typed the wrong e-mail address, and without realizing his error, he sent the e-mail.   Meanwhile, somewhere in Houston, a widow had just returned home from her husband's funeral. The widow decided to check her e-mail, expecting messages from relatives and friends. After reading the first message, she fainted.   The widow's son rushed into the room, found his mother on the floor, and saw the computer screen which read:   To: My Loving Wife  Subject: I've Reached  I know you're surprised to hear from me. They have computers here now, and you are allowed to send e-mails to your loved ones. I've just reached and have been checked in. I see that everything has been prepared for your arrival tomorrow. Looking forward to seeing you then!   Hope your journey is as uneventful as mine was.    Wouldn't that freak you out?
