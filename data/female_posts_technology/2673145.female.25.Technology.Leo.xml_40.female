Spent $16 to lie under the stars and watch Finding Nemo and Whale Rider on Saturday.   We arrived at 7pm and got a reasonably good spot to spread out our mat. Crowd was alright, not as many irritating SPGs or college students like 2 yrs ago when I was there. I was expecting more people but it's better to have more space around the mat then have someone's feet next to your face. It was a breezy night and that's the best weather to have! Most of the families left after Finding Nemo. And we got to enjoy the next movie "WhaleRider" after the chatterboxes shuddup. (They had to be shh-ed to realise. *REB*)   urlLink Whale Rider  is a highly acclaimed New Zealander production about the Maori tradition. The movie started off with muffled sound system (and chatterboxes), so I couldn't figure out what they are talking about. As the movie progresses, the plot thicken and the climax build up (and the audiences were really quiet!). It is about a young maori girl trying to prove to her chief-grandad that she's the next successor. As it is never the tradition to pass on the title to a girl, the grandad got mad at her for trying to break the tradition and being disrespectful to the tradition. There's a very touching scene where I belive most of the female at the Fort were trying to fight back their tears - me too. (*sob sob*) I must say, the actors were really good! Esp the little girl. No wonder she won the best actress award.   It is a very enjoyable and good movie, with subtitles. NZ accent is a little over-whelming. It's worth 5/5!  If you are interested in going for the Starlight Movies, and it's your first time, here are something you should take note. 1. Fill in the qtnaire and grab the goody bag. There's a copy of "Stuff". In it (other then 'nice pix') there's a coupon that admits 2 to Starlight movies on wkdays (Tues-Thurs and Sun, Mon close).  2. They have food stalls.. limited unless nachos, cheezy dogs, ice creams, evian and stella artois are good enough for you. 3. Bring cushions or pillows if you can afford it. It'll relieve your hands to support your head when you lie down to watch the movie. 4. Great event to bring pets and kids.
