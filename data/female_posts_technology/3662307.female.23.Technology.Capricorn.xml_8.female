So many things to learn and people to know....Good luck Nick... The haze is back....This morning saw a handsome guy jogging in the city, shirtless....Nice bod but to be jogging here in the city? Isn't it a bit unhealthy? Hmmm....Received a touching mail from a good friend, encouragng me to change job....Find something of my interest and don't waste anymore time...Thanks Nash, I will do my best....Thanks for your support....
