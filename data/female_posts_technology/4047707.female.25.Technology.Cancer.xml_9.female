It's only cuz i wasn't here.  family from mexico came and i let them borrow my house. not cuz i'm nice or anything it's just that my sister bel who's getting married went to some church marriage retreat thing and she wanted someone to housesit. well my house is closer to my mom's than hers is so i let the mexico people stay here while i stayed at her place. kinda complicated, i know, but whatever trevor. anyway, i made everyone go over there to hang out but it was just alright. on friday we watched fast and the furious and gone in 60 secs and drank alcoholic beverages. wasn't exciting at all. yesterday i went to the mcallen all day and bought all kinds of stuff and then chilled at my mom's house. today the whole fam came over cuz fatty made burgers and chicken wings and we were all here. it was nice. oh oh oh i bought a flat iron from some infomercial and i love ittttt!!! it's the shit! it was a little pricey but i just love my hair. anyway, i pretty much had a boring weekend except for my cool hair. i didn't go to houston but i'm going this weekend. blah! i hate houston. oh i went to go see the village. i can't decide whether i liked it or not. i mean it was pretty good, but....um....ugh how do i say this without giving it away for those people who still haven't seen it. ummmm......fuck it. i wanted to damn monsters to be real or something. they were made up!! how disappointing. but i did like it. i can't decide. ok sleepy time.
