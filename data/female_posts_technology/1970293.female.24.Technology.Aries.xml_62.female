It wasn't fair that she had to go to work this early in the morning.  It felt like she just went to bed.  She sighed and wished she could actually sleep at night instead of tossing and turning.    She grabbed a glass and held it under the faucet.  Turned on the cold water and watched it fill.  She turned off the faucet and took a long drink.  How can water be so tastless and still be good for people.  Oh wait that is probably why it is good for people.  Anything tastless is healthy or at least that is what it seems like.    She didn't really want to think of that especially since she was trying to lose a little bit of weight.    She walked into the livingroom and turned on the tv to see the weather.  It looks like the weather will be good today or maybe that means the weather will worsen as the day turned into evening.  Who can tell on the weather maps.  She clicked the tv off.  It doesn't matter.  It is time to get dressed and go to work once again.    All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003
