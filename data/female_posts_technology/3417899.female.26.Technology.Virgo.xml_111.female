I found it so funny I just had it post it here, for your enjoyment.    Q.  I was a witness in court and got sworn in. They told me I was under oath, after I was sworn in, but I never de-oathed, or un-oathed, or whatever. My girlfriend told me they had to remove the oath before I am safe again. So am I still under oath, or does it wear off, or what?  Hilarious!
