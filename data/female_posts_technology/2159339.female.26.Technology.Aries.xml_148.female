"We should really celebrate soon. I finally found a job and G got into Boston...if only you did something important with your life, we would really have a reason for celebration," she said with a chuckle. I pictured little daggers launching towards her, words that would make it so easy to hurt her. Instead I said I had to go and took a deep breath...of my Camel Light. I called G and congratulated his voicemail. I also yelled at him for leaving me here to deal with this bullshit. I think the trick is to stop visiting. It's time to cut the fucking cord, Abby (pardon me while I have a conversation with myself). But Jewish mothers (and probably mothers in general) can be manipulative. After all, when I was 14, my own gave me pointers on talking to men in a way that makes them think your ideas were their own. At the same time she is kind and sweet and makes all my favorite dishes at a moment's notice and picks up my dry cleaning and gets my friends drunk. What would Dr. E say about this? She would say "Well, Abby. How would you feel about sharing your thoughts with her?" And I would say "Dr. E. We don't talk about feelings in my family, haven't we gone over this?" And she would nod politely and yawn and I would feel bad about boring my psychologist.   Week 2 of No-Bra Wednesdays and I think people are finally starting to notice. I think I'll write it into the company's strategic plan for 2004. That and afternoon naps. Why do I come up with all these brilliant ideas but still get paid so litte?
