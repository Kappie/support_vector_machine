Anyone who has been to one of their concerts lately can see that the entire musical performance of the Democratic convention was modeled after a Dave Matthews Concert. DMB knows the formula of success with the existing generation well and they are sharing access to an entire generation by sharing what they know. In fact, I wouldn't be suprised if they shared crowd footage. (I would like to see it again! I think I may have seen myself in the crowd on the tv, but I was sitting right here at home...)
