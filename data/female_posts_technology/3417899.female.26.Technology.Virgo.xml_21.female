Typically, I am surrounded by elderly people - in wheelchairs, or using walkers, or with scabs on their skin, or shaking uncontrollably, or barely hearing, or in apparent pain.   It's always been my uttermost fear - the fear of old age. (I wonder if there is a formal term for this phobia).  What kind of life is it - to have no control over your body, to be dependent on others. No life. At least not one worth living.   I have told my husband repeatedly - I would rather die. As soon as I can not care for myself, my body, or my soul - I want OUT. I've gotta find a way to make it legal. Have some lawyer just put a bullet through my forehead.  I hope I don't have one of those "humanitarian" kids who want to keep me around for the sake of their conscience... (Maybe I need to make sure they have a killer inheritance - they won't want to wait too long).  I found this response from some doctor on the web - written to a lady with fear of old age:   Ageing can be either seen as growing old or growing wiser. Old age brings wisdom and experience of the years, which can be of great benefit to the youth. It all depends on how you live your life today, physically, psychologically, socially and spiritually. Ageing is inevitable and this reality cannot be changed. What can be changed is how we age. We can either age gracefully and with wisdom, or then we can age with resistance and fear. The only thing you can do is to keep yourself physically fit with good nutrition and exercise, of course without getting obsessed with fitness, because no one is age-proof and immortal. To keep fit psychologically, you could exploit your creative potential, practice relaxation techniques like Yoga etc., develop hobbies, and develop a sense of humour to see the lighter side of things. Socially you can keep fit by developing good interpersonal relationships, which are meaningful and fulfilling, you could engage in some social work to give back to society. This can be deeply fulfilling. On a spiritual level, you could work towards having an emotional closure in all your relationships, by forgiving and asking forgiveness for all the hurts caused by others to you and by you to others, by prayer and meditation, and by finding and fulfilling the purpose of your life. Your past has formed your present, and your present will form your future. Be the best of who you can be in the here and now because that is what is in your hands, and then leave the rest. Here is a prayer of St. Francis for you, which I hope will give you strength.  O Lord, Give me the courage to change the things that I can, The Serenity to accept the things that I cannot change, And the Wisdom to know the difference.
