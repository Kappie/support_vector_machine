I have worked really hard for this job and also to stay in it. For 6 months, I have worked my butt off... taking calls and well, sacrificing... for the sake of my baby. That's the reasin I'm still here in this office. For my baby. She's my life. I don't think I'll be able to survive without her. I want to give her everything I can have and I would do everything for her. I sometimes regret that because of this work, I don't have much time for her. When I get home, I would be able to see her amile, kiss her abit, hug her once or twice before falling off to sleep due to exhaustion. When I wake up, she's already asleep and all I can do is look at her, stroke her... sigh...         Now, I'm not so sure that I will be able to stay long on this job.. I'm hoping that I wil be able to do so... you know.. stay... but no one really knows your future... For now, I'm happy to say that I'm getting there.. slowly but surely... and I'm happy to be where I am today. :)
