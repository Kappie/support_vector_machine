There were only Speedos and now apparently we have bikinis Speedos .. they weren't around a couple of years ago! Obviously I didn't even touch those and went for the one piece suits .. which umm .. were ugh. The one I fit best in was a 38 but it then was baggy in the bottom and my top was all squished up. Plus it had this whole shorts thing going on instead of a high leg cut, and .. it made me look like a beach ball. Not kidding. Another one I tried, to get more coverage supposedly is something one would wear when they want to boogie board .. you know .. black suit .. covers from neck to knees. But .. I look like a whale in that one. So I don't know. Right now I feel so icky and don't think I'll get a swimsuit until I lose weight, which most definitely will not be within the next 2 weeks. Why aren't there anything classic, flattering to someone who's curvy .. or fat, okay I'm fat .. I admit it. I mean what do people who are really fat do? Where do they find suits? Where are they hiding? I wanna join up.   And went shopping for shorts and stuff and I love those boarder shorts, which are so cute with their prints and such .. but umm .. not very nice on me at the moment. My thighs are horrendous. And I can't fit into any kind of normal thing. I tried on a LARGE Jill Stuart tiny t .. and .. it was obscene, to say the least. LARGE!!! Went to this little store that sells all these casual stuff and tried on their largest size - a "9" which was supposed to either be a 10 or 12 UK (8 or 10 US) .. which is SO laughable .. the largest! And hah .. the good thing is that i fit in the pants - my waist does .. but my hips  butt .. nada, so we know what the problem area is :) Btw it does work, that thing where you put the waistband of the pants around your neck .. basically your neck circumference is equal to the length of the pants, flat .. if you don't want to try the pants on - got that from Queer Eye! So in the end went and grabbed some shorts from the "men's" side .. i put that in quotes because I can't believe men can be that small. I tried an xl and then a large and the large fit me kinda right except in the areas where men differ from women .. the waist doesn't cut in and it's all baggy and whatever. But nah, I'm not gonna wear a men's large!!!   You know what, I honestly hope that when I lose weight I'll go down a cup size or a band size or something .. because big boobs are SUCH A BANE! They're worse than big thighs. I mean I know my thighs are huge but I have no problems pulling the suits past my hips and thighs .. but never the boobs. Ugh!! And when my boobs go down .. the hips follow .. it's so freakin' consistent. If I'm a 42", like now .. hips are exactly that as well. My "normal" measurement is about 38" .. it's like 4" down but what a difference that makes apparently. And my waist is about 8 - 10" less than either one, which is a good thing I think .. but could I just not be a larger scale of what I want to be?   So .. hmm .. I have to scrap plans of actually going in the water at the moment. I'll see in 2 weeks whether I've lost weight enough or whatever. If not, I'll be stuck in the sauna or the spa all day instead of by the pool.   I'm now 170lbs btw .. about 77 - 77.5 kg. Very very very large and heavy. I'm working on a three month plan now, totally go for broke like I did last time. Three months, as planned to get down to 150 at least.
