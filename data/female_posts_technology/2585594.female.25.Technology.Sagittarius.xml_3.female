Heidi was tired of the same old thing. Cody was an intelligent man, good in bed, and lavish with his gifts. But he just did not know how to treat Heidi the way she should have been treated. They were together for almost a year, and Heidi still felt insecure every time some Cody commented on some woman's nice legs or ass or boobs.  Heidi wasn't normally like this. She was normally an open-minded non-jealous girlfriend. But with Cody, things were different. And today, Heidi realized why. And a complete stranger helped her.  She was having lunch, as usual, in a restaurant in front of her office building when the waiter suddenly complimented her on her dress. His exact words were 'That dress becomes you.' He had a warm smile, and so Heidi smiled back. And then she thought about Cody. Did he notice that she wore a nice red dress today, with her nails painted the same color, and her sandals showing off her slender, manicured feet. He did not. And then she tried tot hink back to the last time Cody complimented her. And the only time she could remember was when she was wearing a pair of black underwear that he had given her. She thought back some more because she could not believe it was the only time he actually complimented her on something. She could think of nothing else. And then she knew why she was feeling depressed.  Cody did not appreciate her physically. Of course he made love to her. What man would not like some lovin' from his woman? But he never made her feel that she was special to him. In fact, now that she thought about it, he rarely complimented her about her work or her personality either.  And then she knew. All the time that she fooled herself into believing that he was just not the 'complimenting kind' or the 'caring kind', he really didn't see her as special in his life.  And so she broke it off.  Heidi smiled as she walked the five blocks to her home.
