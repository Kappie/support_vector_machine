Today one of the Engineers made a comment to the people at the bank we are working on that I am level one.Making me feel about an inch high.  I could of cried.   I really feel lately that I am not wanted...not needed...and stupid.  Cause if I was smart. People would want to hire me. I feel totally worthless when it comes to my carreer.  And why in the hell am I so scared of standing up to the kids real father????  I guess I know what he is capable of...and that really scares the hell out of me.  He could convince a nun that she had sinned...ya know what I mean???  He is good....so I dont know how to handle him.  Thank god Ken and all 4 kids love me....  I am not bitching...I am just getting things off my mind so I dont dwell on it.
