So this should be...therapeutic for lack of a better word. I'll probably be using this mostly to talk about my journey toward better health....another attempt to say focused on my goal of losing 150lbs in a year and a half. Wow, to even look at that is scary. That's some people's entire weight. I shouldn't be carrying the weight of two people on my body. So it has to go.  Today was a rough day. Went outside thinking I needed to take the car to the alarm place because the alarm seems to have suddenly died. Turns out the entire car had died. The battery was dead---the same damn battery that I had checked a couple of weeks ago!!!!! So had to have the car towed. And you know as I was standing there, trying to figure out how I was going to get back home, I felt so alone. I had no one to call to come help me out...to at least pick me up. No friend, no man. Or maybe I'm just too independent. I could have called Derreck (you'll be reading that name a LOT). But he's sick and I just don't feel comfortable doing that....though I'm sure he would have come. That's just the kind of person he is. But I just called a cab.   So I spent the rest of the day in the house, watching television. Not really cleaning as I am supposed to. Unfocused on my goal. Made a fatty dinner. But I did make some attempt to control the portion size. I am going to have to start using the portion control plate. Drank enough h20 so I hope that balances it out a bit. I am going to hang up those jeans and that dress I want to get into. I'm also going to take a cab to Bally's tomorrow. I need to stay on task. I need to stay focused.
