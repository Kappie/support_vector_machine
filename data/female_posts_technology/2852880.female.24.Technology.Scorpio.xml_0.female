It's really fun to make mixes for people.  It's tough to decide whether or not to include a playlist because I want her to experience the songs as she goes instead of giving them away up front.  But later, it's nice to know who sings what and the titles and all.  Maybe I'll include a separate paper with the songlists with a note not to read until after listening to all the cds.  Welcome to my internal monologue.  I always feel good after doing laundry.  There's just something wonderful about nice clean sheets.  I even washed my pillow today since I've been sick.  Going to sleep will be a treat tonight!  I have an open game of scrabble sitting on my table.  B and I were in the middle of it Valentine's weekend when we had to leave for the airport.  I like it sitting out because it kind of adds his presence to the place.  Feels like someone else is here.  One of these days he'll walk back in and finish the game.  I was losing pretty bad, so I might have to "lose" the scoresheet. :)  I was so warm today that I was able to keep the window open.  Spring has sprung!
