(After the wonderful notice you found, "We can mow your lawn for $40, or you can do it yourself for free! By this date ____!! LOL!) You really don't seem to notice the sunburn you have, cuz your in too much pain otherwise. Well there's an hour of daylight left, what the heck? You decide to totally clean out the car, time for a "car spa". Go all out, after all wherever you need to go she takes ya! (It's a girl car, no attitude) Take it to the car wash, do the whole brush thing. Of course gotta have the "wax option", then topping it off with "spot rinse"! Wow what a difference, there's actually a color under all that dirt ... who would have known? Course then ya do the "shamy thing", no water spots a MUST! Woohooo new vaccumm machine, costs a quarter more but guaranteed to deep clean. Yeah, put the money in ... everything's going smoothly ... oh man, my shirt's getting sucked up .... PANIC! Take the top off? Yepp!!! Didn't see anyone around, have a sports bra underneath ... in the meantime fighting with the machine!!! Yelling at it to stop!! (yepp, it listened 3 1/2 min LATER) Ran outta quarter juice!!! Your too engrossed trying to hold onto the shirt so it doesn't get sucked in any more than it already is, hmmmm wonder how long those people have been there staring at me!!! Well, finally got the shirt out! By the way I wholly recommend that new vaccumm machine, it will suck ANYTHING!!! Just make sure there are no loose items within reach of the NOZZLE, body parts INCLUDED!!! Car is purring on the way home, "me soooo clean" .. the grill is smiling!!! Well, let's go one step further, detail the windows ... AHA how about the floormats? Yepp, throw them in the washer .. lil lazy ... sides no hose!!! So while your detailing the windows, you finally hear the washer ... uh oh!!! Yepp, RUN!!! I sat on the washer trying to hold it down, it finally gets done! Put the mats in the dryer, then go out to finish the windows! Kewl, how sparkly she looks! All gleaming ... well it's been awhile, go to check the floormats ... all dry!! Woohooooo ... just about done! Went to get the keys, floormats in hand ... guess what I walk out to? RAINNNNNNNNN!!! They never taught this in high school!!! We should really talk to the educational department about this! And here I thought, you had to do a dance around a campfire ... with a teepee involved! (no not toilet paper, a teepee ... kinda looks like a cone .. except upside down and no ice cream!)    I sooooooooo hope that your weekend has been as wild as mine has! Now go wash them cars!
