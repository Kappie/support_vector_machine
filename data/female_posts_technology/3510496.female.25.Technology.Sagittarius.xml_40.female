I could not ask for anything more, as long as He lengthens the longevity of the married bliss we've been experiencing and more goodness comes in our way, till Eternity. And on this very day, I pray for Mama to get better and better.  Until she's discharged, I prefer to put the celebration to a KIV mode. Nothing about dampening the spirit, but I rather spend the time with Mama and watch her progresses. Am glad dearest husband is adhering sincerely to it.   Perhaps, wife would make it up by sneaking in that earlier-planned-and-promised Blue bottle of non-alcohol Blue Cocktail *getting all the Blues*. And pop it open by the candlelights after AH visiting hour.   Allow me to end this entry with something extract from my wedding invites. I penned it myself specially for the occasion.  "When we love because of the Almighty.  When we meet, parting is the last thing in mind.  When we are apart, restlessness devours.  Begun a new chapter where on this Day  I choose this Friend to be more than a Friend.  As Man  Wife through Eternity.  May the Almighty shower His blessings."
