Anyways the Verizon guy installed another line and I got ready to jet off to work…got to work to notice my perfectly blow dried hair is starting to do a Zeenat Aman wave in the front…it looks kinda cute but extremely out dated…ok got to go ..need to find a bloody scrungie … to tie up hair…      Question of the Day:  Do you think it’s possible for a girl to be friends with a guy with out having any sexual tension?  I think it’s possible….what about u…?
