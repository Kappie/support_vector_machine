I said it reminded me of McDonald's.  B thinks that says something about me.  I think it says something about society.  We did lots of fun dancing at the wedding.  I tried out some superhigh heels, but ended up changing to lower ones due to the extreme pain I was in after walking like half a mile from the church back to the hotel.  I'm kind of a wimp when it comes to uncomfortable shoes.  I got upgraded to first class on all my flights (4 total since I didn't have any directs.)  I love first class, although Northwest is NOTHING compared to Continental.  Continental's First Class is better than United's too.  Continental is so awesome!  They are so polite and kind, and they serve ice cream with your choice of toppings.  I always get caramel.  It's so good.  Their food is best too.  My big takeaway from the flight was that First Class is dominated by middle-aged white men.  I was the only woman up there on one flight, and on the bigger plane, there were 3 women out of 24 total.  All the rest were middle-aged white guys.  Nice men for sure, but I was glad to represent.  Sometimes I feel guilty getting one of those huge seats when there are way bigger people squishing into tiny seats in the back.  But that ice cream...!  B and I did lots of dancing at the wedding.  I think I already said that.  He looked great in his Armani suit.  It was cool because we didn't really know anyone, so I had him all to myself.  Of course it had it's drawbacks too because we were sitting with a table of strangers, but they went to Princeton, so we had stuff to talk about.    I really enjoy weddings, noticing all the details.  My favorite detail about this wedding was the bouquets, especially the bride's.  It was a whole bunch of pink roses, tightly closed, all poking out in a perfect half-sphere.  Gorgeous!  The ceremony itself was a little awkward because it was in a Catholic church and you could tell that most of the people had never been in a church before.  Nobody sang along with the canter or said the responses or anything.  Well B and I did a little but it was all kind of strange.  They caught on to the shaking hands thing but the people in front of us didn't realize they were supposed to turn around so B  I kind of got gypped.  But on such a happy occasion one can overlook such things.  :-)
