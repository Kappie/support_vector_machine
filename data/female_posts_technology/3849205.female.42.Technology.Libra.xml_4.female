Im not drinking enough water. I didnt work on wood yesterday like the day before either.   I can only do my best.   It has been a good day today. I had a nice shrimp salad and some low carb icecream. I need to be eating more meat, which I am going to work on.  I will be going camping for a few days so I wont be writing Friday, Saturday or Sunday. I have planned ahead for this and tonight went shopping for food. I got tuna for some tuna salad. Im going to boil some eggs, taking chicken and steak and some large shrimp. I am also taking salad.
