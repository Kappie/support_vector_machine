Hubby threw a tempertantrum until 12 am, and i sat on the couch in tears for the next 5 hours because of the damn tooth pain!  imagine about 9 teeth feeling like they are loose, and every movement, breath, or change in outer elements make you want to scream!  yup thats me!  1/2 a dozen tyenol, a big ol cup of hot coffee,  and some nyquil later, it was FINALLY sleep time !   Im dreading how my Cube Guard is going to react tomorrow....  I think im going to have to steal Mrs. Hill's idea and put up a tazer.... hehehe  Anyone want to pack my house up for me?  Im willing to pay in, cookies, beer, and bad ass apple pies ( if i do say so myself)  even though i know that mixture sounds nasty... heheheheh   hummm, 2 oclock... only 3 more hours till my WONDERFUL hubby yells at me for " being home all day and doing nothing!"  ummm... hello!!! SICK! what dont you understand about that!  ok, im done with my poor poor me post!!! next one will be better ! promise!
