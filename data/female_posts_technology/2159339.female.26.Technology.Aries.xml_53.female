He is amazing live - the cardiac-arrest-like full body gyrations, the retarded-esque hand waving, the bored and depressed look on his face that seems to say 'i hate you all' equal to 'cream-in-your-jeans' hot!. Batty and I danced right next to the stage and screamed "i love you" and "be my babydaddy" to him. Ok, the second one I screamed in my head, but whatever.   It's friday, halleluja. Today batty  I are off to see Ladybug Transistor...Only have one of their songs, but my friend compared them to magnetic fields and that's all I really need to become an obsessed freak of a fan.  And check this! => all the directors are at some retreat, so we're having a happy hour in the office. They're bringing in kegs and food and maybe music. This friday won't be as cool as last week, but free breakfast and beer in the afternoon ain't bad.
