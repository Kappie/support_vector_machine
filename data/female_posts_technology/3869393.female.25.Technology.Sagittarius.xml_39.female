Man, am I a relieved soul or what!!! I have been literally begging the top management to relieve me from this pain for over 4 months, and its' finally happend!  I have had really my hearts content of misery with this recruiter, starting from mails, to arrogance, technical nonsense and even outright jumps in Authority!  On side there is happiness that I have been relieved from this pain and misery, and on the other side, there is unhappiness that it had to come down to this.   Now I will have to wait and watch as how she reacts to the entire situation, am quite sure that she is going to try and gather as much sympathy from everyone before she leaves and leave this place as a god's gift to resourcing!  God only knows if I am going to receive hate mail now...have had one round of it already, am I going to get another round!  Well,this is what I am going to do now...am going to pray that there is a smooth transistion and things pick up for my team!
