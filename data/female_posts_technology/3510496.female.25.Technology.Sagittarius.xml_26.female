But these are all facts, and what say you?  Two of them are faced with quite different but pretty same problems. One is single, and her parents are heavily dependable on her, despite having other stable children. The other is married, and both her parents n PIL are heavily dependable on her and spouse.  The depicted scenario above is what they claim a typical Asian Parents. You know; bring-up the children, look through children's education, children grow up and start career, working children contribute money to parents, and children look after parents in their old age.  Versus Western Parents, parents make children save up for their college, children go to college, parents 'kick' their children out to get their own apartment when they  urlLink    graduate/start their career (normally 21 years above), and both parents and children go on with life independently.  Well, conventionally as a child, I think we are responsible to look after our parents. Our society, or rather our gahmen policies, do not go in par for us to observe Western Parents styles. No 1, our gahmen allows only 35-years above to purchase a flat single-handedly. Well, you have renting options. But if every Singaporean parents 'kick' out their Singaporean child out of the house, mind you, land is scarce here.  No 2, our gahmen doesn't encourage a 60-year old and above to stay alone in own home due to health/safety reasons. Well, gahmen offers those studio homes, but still it's an unpopular choice of habitat for the senior citizens.  You can call me a typical, married child. Get married, hunt for your 'own' nest, and shift-out. The reasons, apart from the normal-want-to-be-independent; to make space of my parents' place for my siblings, to make space for future offsprings in new home and to have own privacy space for ourselves (yours truly and spouse).   urlLink    And I am glad to have pretty independent parents, as in not heavily depending on me in terms of financial, household-tending etc. With the flat fully paid-off, school-years left only for lil' sister, long-time savings and investments, God's willing, my parents can retire comfortably.  I hope to be like them too. I believe as  urlLink    parents, in nowadays-time, we should plan ahead, for better of our children and of course old-age. Of course there are macro environment factors that can 'bite' us, like health problems. And it's pretty touting to accept the fact medical bills in our lion-city can come up to. Health is *really-really* Wealth.   In some cases *the vice-versa of Western Parents*, parents here are 'kicked' out by the children. So indeed it's a smarter choice, for parents to own their own property to avoid this social problem. But still, if you have your own and live your way up to 60, alone, then you will be brought back to gahmen policy no 2.  *SIGH*  urlLink    I know, I know. There are much more problems than that, many different cases. Well, can we just say we leave it all to Him? We plan, He decides.
