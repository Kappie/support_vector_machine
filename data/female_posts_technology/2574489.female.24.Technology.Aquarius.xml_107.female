For example, we live on a budget, and he  never  spends money on himself without feeling guilty.  Even a freaking purchase from McDonald's makes him guilty.  So he rarely spends any money on himself.    Our recent foray into the mall over the weekend illustrates this point.  We have gotten a sizable tax refund back, half of which paid a credit card off.  This leaves a lot of money for mini splurges, even after putting away some money for savings.  I've gotten a gym membership for myself and one of my wishlist items, my  urlLink Coach   wallet.  Woody elected to send some money to his sisters.  I had to  force  him to buy something he really wants.  A pair of brown dress shoes.    On Sunday, after a trip to his favorite East Buffet Restaurant with a bunch of friends and Rhy, we were lured to The Parks Mall because of the sales in  urlLink Foley's  and  urlLink Dillard's .  I urged him to pick out a pair of nice brown shoes cause he's been wanting them.  He was agonizing over getting it, even after everyone told him he was getting a good deal on these beautiful Kenneth Cole shoes we found.  It was originally $125 and it was on sale for $71.99.    He finally got it.  He looks gorgeous in them.
