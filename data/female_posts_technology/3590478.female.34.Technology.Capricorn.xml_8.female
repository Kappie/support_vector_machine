On the season premiere of Aqua teen hunger force (number 1 in the hood, G) the aqua teens were spending their Tues evenings in the thinking man tavern playing trivia. That bar is in my hood! And the aqua teens went there! How easily amusing is that? So, that is plan for this Tues. It starts at 7:30. The address is 537 W Howard Ave., it's near the Decatur high school. In the episode Meat wad wanted to answer every question with "the backstreet boys". If you come I promise not to do that. (Besides, I'm old so if I felt the urge to answer every question with the name of a boy band it would be "the Osmonds". Or possibly "Hanson" but that answer wouldn't have anything to do with my age. Just the fact that I am very, very disturbed.)  Ah, the links. What the?! This link is about some mad British unproduced sitcom. It seems brilliant. Almost too brilliant to be true.  urlLink http://www.thejunkies.com/   The wacky animals. Can we ever get enough?  urlLink http://www.lostandfrowned.com/smefacts.html   My current most favorite site of all time.  urlLink http://monfrigo.plainsong.net/?id=1  I have no idea what it says as it is in French. But it's photos of the inside of some frog's fridge! The entertainment level on this one is through the roof.
