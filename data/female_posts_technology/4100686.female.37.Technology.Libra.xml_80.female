Some journalists head out of Iraq towards Jordan while  urlLink others remain.  The media  urlLink gears up.  Two peace activists target a B52 in RAF Fairford.  urlLink They were stopped after attaching photographic images of ordinary Iraqi people labeled collateral damage? to the fence, planting white poppies, a symbol of peace and sowing seeds to represent life.    At dawn in a largely deserted oceanic former penal colony, two friends climb to the top of a  urlLink national icon.  Normally the small, dry, continents politicians would leap at an opportunity to exult such patriotic, endearing, qualities as mateship and larrikinisim. On this day last year there are no ministerial belly laughs. National security has been breached by little more then an exterior decorators instinct and the tools of the home improvement trade, paint rollers and an operatic rouge.
