I could definitely get used to this.' I'm smart enough to know that it's all smoke and mirrors. I'm stupid enough to keep doing it. I told him last night that our budding, slightly awkward physical relationship will kill our frienship and he kissed me on the forehead and asked 'So you just want to be friends then?' ... good point. I have NO IDEA what the hell I want. I want someone else to make the decision for me, actually. Maybe Batty? Or Dr. E, whom I'm seeing tomorrow. A few days after my last meeting with her, I wrote down everything that I wanted to discuss next time. But none of those issues are on my mind anymore so maybe we can concentrate on this rather than the usual, overrated parents/career talk.  And Batty, while you dated the ugliest person in the world for two years, I dated the meanest for 5, which is infinitely worse...live and learn.
