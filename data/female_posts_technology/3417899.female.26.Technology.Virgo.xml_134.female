With the weather being as beautiful as it has been for the past few days, the windows are open, and I can hear them clearly.  I feel guilty, knowing I am hearing something I shouldn't be hearing. Invading their privacy. And I feel strangely jealous. They are doing what I  should be wanting to do .   I get in bed and close my eyes and try to ignore the moans.  The water in our shower stops running - my husband has finished his shower and will soon join me in bed.  I pretend to be asleep as he tiptoes into our room quitely and then into our bed. He carefully pulls the cover around himself - careful not to move, not to wake me up.   We lay there - both of us hearing our neighbors. Neither of us moving a muscle.  And I wonder what he is thinking. Is he aroused? Annoyed? Jealous? Is he mad at me for not being the wife I should be - like the wife next door?
