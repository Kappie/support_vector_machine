I was horrified when my wonderful T-FAL sauce pan decided to go up in flames.  I turned off the stove in a hurry, rushed to the sink and doused the flames with our sink spray.  Thank you, Lord, for keeping me safe.  When the flames were down (and after placing a frantic call to my hubby), I sponged up the water around the kitchen and examined the metal stove cover-thingie.  It was black.  The culprit was probably oil.  Yikes!  And for what did I go through that trouble for?  Why, boiling some penne pasta for some Pesto pasta, that's what!    That's Hubby's finger picking on the penne   Recipe:  Pasta (Penne, Bowtie) Fresh Basil Grated Pamesan cheese Salt Pepper Olive Oil  Boil pasta, Add finely chopped basil, grated parmesan, salt and pepper to taste and olive oil.  This is my way of doing it.  I'm sure there's better out there.  And Atkin dieters, this is a no-no, sorry!
