I'll be leaving for Bali with my 2nd sis, Zon on Sat until Mon. Probably will dive on Sunday. I hope I can find good bargains there.  After this week, there won't be any public holidays until April - Good friday. And that's another long weekend. I wonder where I'll go. It'll definitely be to Malaysia (near and cheap).
