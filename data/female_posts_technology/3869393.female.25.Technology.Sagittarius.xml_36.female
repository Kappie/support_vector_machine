Woke up at 6 am, ran to the gym literally, wished everyone the best, gave my farewells to them and quite literally ran thro my workout. Reached home at 8, had a quick bath and got into my saree. Gosh, had it been ages or what since I wore one of these! Had taken a vow that I would not wear one of these, unless and until I dropped some weight...hehe...dropped a few kgs, so I guess this will count...;) Reached office at 9;10am, only to be hounded by one question, "why saree?" and one comment, "you look really very nice in one!" After a while, I think I kindof started to hear only this and it kept ringing in my head for hours together ! Man, utter pain, I dont think I should ever wear a saree again to office. If for a simple purple saree people say this, wonder what they would say if I were to wear my black and red saree...hmm...food for thought I guess..hahaha!   Friday afternoon ....  This is where the entire trip began, took permission from office and began my trip down south. This was a trip with a difference since this time the reason was not me to drive down to my dad's native place, but mycousins and my dad. First stop was at Pondy, man, the hotels are getting reallly sad with their food or else my tongue has gone for a complete toss that I do not understand the taste of food any longer! Whichever the case, it was a rush and dash stop there. Once that completed, the drive down to Mayavaram began. We had promised one of the relatives that we would come down for a function at the temple, so this stopover. We reached Mayavaram at 7 that night, was all smoky instead the temple as the yagna had been in process for over 5 hours. Stopover here was a lot longer than me anticipated, from a planned 30 minutes stop it became a 1.5 hours stopover. My little cousins had come along from the native to join us here, so though the stop over was really long, I didnt really feel the pain of the time which elapsed. The dharshan at the temple was really good, though the smoke sure began to irritate my nose!   Then at 8:45pm, began the drive to my dad' native. Courtesy of the bridges being redone, a 40 minutes drive became a 1.5 hours drive, and with the complete lack of lighting on those roads, it was a complete nightmare. Slowly around 10:30 reached my dad's native. As I pulled myself out of the car,legs were totally cramped up coz of the long drive, I noticed that I had forgotten to bring my drawing notepad. Dinner was ready so after a quick wash it was a run to the dinner table. Dinner was followed by the first movie of the weekend. We started the movie at 11:30pm, a tamil movie called "aetheree" and that went on till 1:30am. Good hilarious movie, simply didnt make too much of sense though...hahaha..but then, whats new to tamil movies, they never had story lines or any sense of connection. Once the movie was over, began the chatting session with my uncle, and that went on for over an hour, finally hit the sack at 3am.   Saturday....   Courtesy of the long night, I had to literally pull myself out of bed, as we had to visit a temple at 9. Once the usual cumbersome daily routine was over, the time to jump into a saree came again. I was kindof wondering which saree to wear, a red one or the deep blue. Both were quite sentimental sarees for me, red one had worn it to my grandpa's 80th birthday and the blue one was the one I wore to his sis's wedding. I was not able to decide coz both look really nice on me, so I asked my little cousin to pick a saree. He picked the red one, so it was the blue on for Sunday, for the drive back. I hurried into the red saree, almost tripped trying to fix it, was quite a hilarious moment on the road..hahaha. Today was electricity maintainene day, so no electricity from 9 am to 4pm. Man, wearing a saree and no current around is probably the worst thing which can ever happen! Anyway, got thro with that, visited the temples with my little cousins, two temples, Mudikondan and Sirupuliyur. Quite beautiful and quaint temples, of Lord Rama. Then it was lunch time, got back into town, had lunch at 2pm, and hit the sack for a while, actually for 15 minutes, only to be woken up by my little cousin stomping on my stomach.   Then began his entertainment time, I had to teach him, his sister and their friends origami. For the next 3 hours, all I did was teaching a bunch of kids who age ranged from 14 to 3, how to make water bombs, dragons, penguins, frogs, fish, butterflies and baskets. Man, it sure is one major pain to teach kids...god only knows how my mom does it so well!!! I guess Sagitarrians tend to be useless with kids...and should just leave that task to Cancerians!  At 6pm, my aunt and I decided to go shopping, but before we could actually leave the house, my dad decided that he wanted to go to another temple, so all plans got postponed. This temple we had to go was on the mayavaram road, and is a temple closely associated with our family. This is the temple, my great grandpa used to do his pooja's at from the age of 5 and more than anything this is the temple at which my dad's star birthday was celebrate while my great grandpa was alive. The main deity in this temple is called Bhaktavatsala Perumal and looks so handsome. Even in the darkness, yep, no current yet again, his features were so beautifully highlighted that one could only but get lost his amazing eyes.  We finshed up with this temple by 8pm and just as I began to relax out my cousin arrived back from her tution class and she was completely determinedto drag me out. I then quickly changed into something light and easy and went hunting for the driver. This was one useless exercise as the driver jsut did a major disappearing act. After 20 minutes of fruitless effort, I decided okay, just to adapt to the walk mode. At about 9pm, my cousin and my aunt began our walk to the shopping area. Narrow lanes, a zillion scooters, gawking bystanders, grrr...totally differnt experience. Reached the shopping center at 9:30pm only to be greeted by my uncle, who drags me across the counters to select some clothes for my parents and me. So much for my shopping! This exercise lasted for 50 odd minutes, not becoz there was so much of choice, but becoz there was so little!!! Was terriblynauseous at this point and needed something to drink atleast. We then headed to a bakery around the corner, was expecting a dingy hole, only to be presented with a shop with all the appearences of a Hot breads in a sleepy town of Tiruvarur! Had a drink here and settled my stomacha little, as my cousins tried their hands at a pizza. What a pizza they had,thepizza minus tomato, onion and capsicum...lol...yep, jus the base..hahaha!  By the time I reached home it was nearly 11pm, and that then the next movie began, Gilli. Electricity cuts,fluctuations, etc, did not deter me from checking this movie out and this ran on till 1:30. At the stroke of 12am, I wished my dad and was kindof a special occasion, coz this had never happend before. Never have I ever had the chance to wish him at the stroke of 12 on this birthday. Once the move was over, my uncle, aunt and I had a round of cards, and this game went on till 3:30am. Thats when sleep and tiredness began to over take me. Hit the sack at about 4am and was woken up at 6:30am the next day! So much for getting some sleep!  Sunday...  This was one of the most exciting days in this trip. After nearly 35 years, my dad's birthday was celebrated in his hometown. My, was he happy on what! We had arranged for a complete pooja at our temple and this was done with complete dedication. The pooja took some time and most of our plans were getting a touch disturbed due to the delay. Had our lunch at 10am, and then began our trip to my favourite temples with my uncles' family.  Another first which happend on this trip, visit to natchiyar koil on lord garuda' star birthday, yep, my dad and the lord share the same bday. To our surprise there was a major yagna happening there and it was quite a overwhelming time which we had here. The entire pooja took over 1.5 hours and by the time we were done here, it was almost 12:50pm. I was quite nervous that I would misss the next temple, Uppiliappan as it is one of the temples with which I have a very deep connection. We stepped into the temple at 1:05 and we greeted by the information that, since it was a sunday, the temple is kept open till 1:15pm. We made one dash to the main temple to be greeted by the priest who seems to have memorized my face courtesy of our 6 trips in the last 2 months.   Had an amazing dharshan here, upclose and personal, as they allowed my family to go right upto the main temple gate before the God. Suddenly, out of the blue, the priest came in front of me, and took some waterand sprayed it onto me, and said, I understand what u've been thro', dont worry there's lots to go in life still. I dont know where than came up from , coz all he knows of me is a devotee who is a relative of one of the trustees in this temple. He then took out a garland from the deity and handed it to my mom saying, put this around her neck and ask her to go around the temple, the time has come! I was quite taken aback over this, coz I had no idea about whats going on, and neither did my parents.   We then tried to visit another temple, but found this place closed. Then my uncle and his family turned around and headed back home, while we headed back to Chennai. We had one more temple to visit on the way, one seriously long pending one. This was our visit to Srimushnam. One seriously amazing temple with regards to sculptures. This temple infact is supposed to have been a dance heritage and also is one of the 7-8 temples in the 108 divya deshams for which ppl believe that the deity appeared on its knows and no one has any idea of its history.  We finished up with this temple at 5:30pm and began the final lap of our journey. Gosh, one set of terrible roads, a drive which should have taken 20 minutes to get to a particular town, took over 90 minutes. The roads were a serious case of Rest in Pieces!!! From that junction, the journey to Chennai was quite taxing, heavy traffic, blarring lights, I just couldnt take it and fell asleep for 2 hours. All thro those 2 hours, all I could think was what the priest said...why, how ? As we reached Chennai, think about5 minutes or so to the toll gate, I then said to myself, dont ask questions, just take this at face value and accept stuff! As I took that decision and we crossed the toll gate, it began pouring heavily. We hardly had any visibility, road a quite slippery too! Slowly and steadily for the next 40 minutes, we drove into Chennai, at 11pm.  Was dead tired and jsut wanted to hit the sack, could feel the pain in my bones and my stomach was jsut about set to do a strike! Quickly heading into the house, gobbled up something to eat...and just hit the sack at 11:45pm.   This was what caught my imagination in the entire trip....Actually, afterI completed two rounds of the temple, I went over and asked the priest what this was all about, since I was far too curious. All he said was, "The time has come for you to make peace, believe in yourself and trust the future. Dont worry about the past, it will stay as memories for you always. There will be a time when all with make peace with each other, dont worry, have no fear over this!"  I dont know what made him say so, why he said so, etc, all I do know is that, Lord Uppiliappan is giving my life some direction now, and if it's his direction, so be it.All the questions to which I wanted answers have been put at rest, I dont want to know anything more. Its' time for me to put my future in perspective and dream for my future now onwards!   Keeping this in mind, this morning I woke up at 6:30 am and prepared a list of things/ activities which I need to accomplish in the near future, max 6 months and began planning towards achieving them!   A fewlessons I have learnt in this trip.....  1. Memories can never be washed/ locked away, its' always better to cherish them and smile over them, than treat it with disgust as a part of one's past. 2. You can try to change destiny, no harm in it, but destiny will always find its own way of bringing you back to the original path. 3. One needs to take responsibility of their own life, believe that life has a lot to offer them and not get bobbed down over the fact that someone else has something, or someone else is getting more out of life, or that you have lost something in a relationship which the other has not! 4. Our life is not a profit and loss story, its a cash flow statement, the profit as well as the loss, finds its own way of being ploughed in as an investment or getting marked in our lives as a Debt which needs to be adjusted somewhere else. 5. The human mind is a beautiful piece of architecture and mechanic, when you want to forget stuff it will see to that you remember and when you want to remember it will see to that you forget. You cant change it's nature, coz thats what we are made of! We are humans, and this is human nature. Blocking things/ memories/ running away, etc will never work, face the issue head on, thats when your mind and soul will be able to work in sync and allow you to find peace!  Life is a sine curve, sometimes your seated on the crest, sometimes on the trough!Life forces you to go thro' this sine curve only to test your strength in yourself  others!
