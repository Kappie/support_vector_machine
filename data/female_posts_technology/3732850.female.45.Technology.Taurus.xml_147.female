It brought images of my grandparents and picnics with my family to mind.  It also brought back images of my sister and I and the little sneaky things we used to try to get away with.  Especially when she says "stolen sips of whole milk" and "standing there with my sisters peeking at my kissing parents through the long grass.      I like the last paragraph in that she talks about how she wants for her children what she had growing up.  I think that we all want more for our children.  In wanting that for them, we sometimes forget to also instill hard work and determination and to not forget the simple things are sometimes the best in life.
