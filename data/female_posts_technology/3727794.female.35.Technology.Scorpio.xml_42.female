My total fave is here, hot policeman, yummy... DAMN I forgot how pretty he was.     Here we are at the train station ready for dim sum for breakfast. The picky eating white girl was actually putting away some serious eggrolls and pickled cucumbers at 9 in the morning. Probably why all those asian girls are so damn thin!    Here's the real hotties, I had so much fun on this trip!!!  We ate ate ate and shopped shopped shopped and danced with stinky men, what else could you ask for?    Here's the whole batch of pictures...  urlLink http://photobucket.com/albums/v256/TreasureGoddess/Chicago%202004/
