In fact, he sometimes feels the need to change twice, even three times a day.  If he had the money to keep doing so, he would change underwear hourly.  Really....=)  Recap of my weekend  Friday night: Watched  Underworld  at Tony's house.  His housemates, B and G had gotten a new big-screen HDTV.  Cool.  They also cooked.  Pretty good: grilled chicken, mac n cheese, rice in cream of mushroom sauce and  frites  (french fries).  Saturday: Slept in! Went to school to finish labs.  Freaked out over hubby's purchase of new tires (badly needed).  Went to dinner at OG.  Read  Phantoms  by Dean Koontz.  Finished it at 3 am!  Sunday:  Family (Mom, Dad, Rhy and little Jedd) visited us in our new apartment for the 1st time.  We cooked for them, they brought dessert and some Boston Market chicken.  Good lunch!  Husband is such a good cook.  They brought over a belated gift for husband's b-day.  Thanks parents!  We then went to mall and goofed off there.  I got an early b-day present from my mom (wooden jewelry box from Bombay) and she also bought me some Express shirts. Thanks mom!  We then ate at East Buffet.  Yummy fried chicken dumplings there.  Went home.  Such homebodies.  Thinking of going indoor rock climbing next weekend to shake things up.  END Summary
