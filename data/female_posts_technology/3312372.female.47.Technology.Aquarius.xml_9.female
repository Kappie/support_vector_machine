Ofy brought her three children over to play with my little boy. They brought me beautiful belated Mothers Day cards and a really nice mask(I collect them.) We all had a great time. It was fun to share some laughs with friends. The children had a good time also. Ofy actually has two children. She recently has taken on the respousiability of taking care of her husband's sister child. She didn't want to elaborate on it today. I guess when she's ready she will tell me what's going on. I hope Shiho had a good time it was her first time visiting my home. She's a really nice little Japanese girl. Well my boyfriend ??? did'nt call today but he sent an E-mail. It sure would be nice if he could open up and talk about our complicated relationship. Well it is very late and I have to get ready for manic Monday tomorrow since I was lazy and just enjoyed myself today.                   Peace :)
