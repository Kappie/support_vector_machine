I don't have a very large readership because I haven't told all that many people.  It's hard to decide who to tell because sometimes I feel like I have to watch what I write depending on who reads this stuff.  I suppose, since this is public, that I should assume everybody is reading it.    I wish my friends had blogs so I could check up on them.  I think I'm getting old.  I went to this birthday dinner last night at a nice restaurant and people in our group were playing with balloons and salt.  This one guy would rub the balloon on his armpit so it had static, then he'd hold it up to a pile of salt.  The salt would jump up to the balloon and make a mess.  I appeared to be the only person put off by the whole incident.  I felt bad for the waiter who was going to have to clean up after us.  And it's just kind of annoying when you have salt flying around the table.  There were lots of penis and vagina jokes too.  I suppose I am getting old, but that's fine with me.
