Don't forget to watch  urlLink The Grid  on the 19th.  Julianna Margulies is so pretty.  She should have left ER a season or two before she did.  Saw the musical Cats last night.  There is something to be said for distance when watching one's favorite musical.  Third row from the stage does not hide much.  They have changed some things but the actress that played Grizabella, had an awesome voice.  Well then anyone that can sing Memory with a strong tone gets me everytime.  Scenery hasn't changed in years nor should it really.  Costumes have a bit.  So have some of the shapes of the cast.   While in the great white north woods I'll be doing all kinds of reading, playing with the kids, and cross-stitch.  Have fun ya'll!
