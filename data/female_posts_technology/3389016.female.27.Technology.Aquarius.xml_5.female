Anyway, I will try to take you on the trip with me as it happened. I will try to catch up to now and keep a record of my journeys. This is really for all of you out there that I have bought a postcard for and never dropped it in the mail. I have a whole stack of them piling up.   Feedback is always good to hear so let me know if you have any suggestions on how I can make this less narcissistic. I hope you enjoy!  urlLink
