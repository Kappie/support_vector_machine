Naturally, Joe and I have a boss-employee relationship, with all it's complexities and intricacies. As the years went by, and our positions changed, the company grew, then shrunk. At some point I was promoted and was no longer under him - I was a colleague. Then he was promoted and became my boss again.  Nevertheless, the relationship morphed and in addition the boss-employee tier, another tier had been layered on top. A tier where we are, one could say, friends. Where he shares his opinions and thoughts with me and I with him.Where we can speak freely of the company and what management may be doing wrong, as well as about personal issues, trouble at home, etc.  We're at a point where, despite him being my  boss , I feel (felt?) very comfortable to just be me around him. Quirky, and all.    Scolded! : We're at a meeting table, holding an internal office meeting to review some new presentations and collateral. With us are a couple of other employees, one of them a recent hire. I get a call form one of our customers who is having an urgent difficulty with our software and needs an engineer dispatched onsite ASAP. These are the types of things Joe deals with (approving somebody's trip from Israel, etc). So I tell him the contents of the call, and then I say "It's  your  task now." And point my finger at him.  A few minutes later I leave for another meeting. As I am driving to my meeting, Joe calls my cell phone.  He is angry. And he says I shouldn't have talked to him like that, or pointed at him. And that I need to be "put in my place" and I can't feel so "at ease" and "friendly" with him, especially around new employees. He is, after all, my boss - and I should behave accordingly.   What do I do: I apologize and say it won't happen again.   I've been scolded. Now it's awkward. When the line between boss and friend gets blurred - things get... "mucky".  urlLink Mucky . That's how things are.
