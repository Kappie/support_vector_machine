After a reasonably short wait at the border I headed to Grand Rapids, back to work.  When I got home I was exhausted and hungry, I'd had an egg McMuffin at 7, but nothing since then.  For some reason driving never makes me hungry.  So I made a sandwich then went to bed.  But once I got to bed I couldn't sleep.  So I got up again, put on a heavy sweater (its freezing out) and headed to UM.  Catch up on my surfing.    Now I'm drinking my coffee and surfing along.  Which reminds me, I made my dad happy this weekend.  At my aunt and uncle's house I had a cup of coffee.  He looked at me, then said, "you've started drinking coffee?!  It's about time!"  Hee hee, he's been trying to get me to drink coffee for years.
