George Michael says (sings) in one of his songs: "And I know all the games you play, because I play them too..." Interestingly enough,  knowing  the game, does not necessarily mean not falling for the game.   "Is that your natural eye color? Your eyes are so beautiful"...   The equivalent of "Have you been working out?".  Cliche. Corny. Predictable.  And yet - I fell for it. I fall for it every time. I'd fall for it again, given the chance.  I, robot.
