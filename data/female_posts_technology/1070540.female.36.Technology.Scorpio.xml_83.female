I told him it would have been common curtosy to call me and I would of told him it was ok to stay at her house late it is summer break. But I cant let this go unpunihsed. Yes he has a midnight curfew, but it was my understanding that he was just going out to dinner. Ken said the punishment is having to be home by 630 during the week and 830 on week ends. That is fine with me. But I am going to make a list. The one thing that I hated when I was growing up is that mom and dad never did the same punishment for everyone. Maybe it sounds stupid, but I dont care. I always felt like I had the hardest punishment and when i asked my mom she said it was because she expected more out of me than she did them. Well thats not a good reason so I begin tonight. He is a 14 year old and I am having to learn. But If I keep track then I will know what to do and my job as a mother/parent may become easier with time. (doubt it though).
