I realized that the profession of journalism needs a tough heart to listen to tragic stories - and then smile and write them in a calm way, to write the truth.   Well, it seems Faiza gritted her teeth and toughened her heart and wrote what she heard; the confusion, the shock, the dusty, grimy, day to day survival that nobody seems to want to know about, because it is so unfortunately common.

Ays reports roads to  urlLink Al-Aadamiah neighborhood north of Baghdad  are blocked, some are expecting "bad news", Ays says he hopes it is just rumours and that it may be only checkpoints.
