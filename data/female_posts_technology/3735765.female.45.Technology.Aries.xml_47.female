Funny, it comes after a month of turmoil because I am not bringing in enough income to make ends meet and the day after my interview for the promotion at work.  I sure could have things working out for me in the end for a change.  It would certainly be a long time coming.  I did get my daughter back in with me; this is good.  I had the interview at work; this is good.  I have a friend's son focused upon working towards a career in computers, with an appointment at a technical school next week; this is good.  I am helping the women's shelter get a much needed interior paint job next week, as well as getting trained on their phone systems; this is good.  Recently I discovered a way to take Spanish for virtually free (just paying $8 to the senior center, and they'll let me in without qualifying as a senior, and $11 for the workbook); this is good.  A good friend of mine reported to me last night that she got the job she had been vying for during the past couple of months; this is good.  Are things really going to work out in the end?  Hopefully, the "end" is not all that close for me, however, I certainly wish for more good coming my way than not for now!!  Is that asking for too much????  I don't think so.  In fact, good things are already starting to come along my way.  Life can be good!! :)
