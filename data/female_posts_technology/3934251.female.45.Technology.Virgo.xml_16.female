We always go to the same place where the food is crap, the wine is ok, the staff are lovely and the company is familiar.  In my case, familiarity is not breeding contempt. I relish this hour or so I spend with people I really like even though some of them tease me mercilessly (yes, Anthony, you)  I know they are my friends. I know they are there if I need them. And that makes me realise I am very lucky indeed.
