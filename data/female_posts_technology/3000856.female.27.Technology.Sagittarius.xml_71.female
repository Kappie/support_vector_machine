There is still a little bit of tom-boy in me. I am so not lady like. I will be the first to admit it.  Growing up I was always one of the boys and I still am the only difference now is I have breasts and sometimes they get more attention then anything. LOL My roomate Aaron and friend of 14 yrs said that I still am one of the boys, but many don't see me as a boy anymore and have not for years! I hate when he says that. I will always be one of the boys now if only certain people will learn that we will all be good! Had to cancel some stuff last night cause a friend needed me. She is going through some stuff right now and can't deal w/ a lot. It's funny how many of my friends come to me for help and advise and I can barely deal w/ my own stuff. I need to take some of the advise that I dish out! Jess gave my resume to her boss and I guess she was impressed but confused why I am leaving the field I went to school for.  I am not leaving willingly I just need a stable job that is not gonna let me go because they want to combine the 2 labs! I have been looking at hospitals all over and no one is hiring in my field or they want at least 5 yrs exp and I only have a little over 1 yr. I only graduated in Dec of 2002! I hate this stupid crap of job searching. Maybe I should have just stayed at the railroad. It was stable, the money and benefits were great, and I would have had tons of seniority by now. It was just not me which is why I went back to school. Thinking about going back to school again. I think I have spent more time in school than anything. I don't think I have the time right now though. I should as Jeremy put it, quit my job and find a sugar daddy to pay my bills while I go back to school. LOL Not a bad idea Jer ;) Gotta fly I need to leave work a little earlier for this wedding!
