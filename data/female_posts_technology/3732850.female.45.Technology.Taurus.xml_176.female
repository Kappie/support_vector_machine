It says in the Ten Commandments that to kill is a sin, and that this sin is punishable by eternal damnation in hell. I do believe this, but I also believe that families do deserve some redemption.  I would have to say that killing someone, for their satisfaction is wrong no matter who pushes the switch. I would sooner have a criminal that deserve such a sentence be left to rot in a labor prision. Atleast this way society could profit from their work and they would have no hope of ever getting out.
