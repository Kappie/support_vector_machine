If you don't intend to watch, could you please tell me why?   My opinion: Fantastic movie. Thru the movie, I empathised with Christ and understood the meanings. I could also understand why this movie is made. There are serveral so-so or bad reviews, but I feel that they did not see the reason for making this film. Or maybe I'm biased? After a discussion with my sis, we think people can either don't like the show, find it either meaningless and ridiculous, meaningful and worth-while, or interesting and provoking. The show made me want to find out more about Christ. It's not just for Christians or Catholics. It's also for non-believers if you keep your mind open. :)  After the show, me and friend were quite 'disturbed'. We end up discussing about Christ and religion for 1 hr over a cup of hot tea (for me)/coffee(for him). I believe we will be reflecting on ourselves for the next few days. For the record, he's a buddhist while I'm a christian and we believe that we worship the same God. There can only be one God.  I went home and continued my work. Long story short, Indian guy in US hogged on the test machines for serveral weeks, and request that I complete my test by this week so that he can do his next wk. I wrote back to say that I am left with the weekend which I'll try to do as much as possible, but no gaurantee, and we should share the limited resources. This guy has made quite a name in the company. He was first in S'pore office. He wasn't able to understand what was taught, and couldn't handle simple tasks. He left, and went to US. With his Director brother's as backing, he got in to my company again. Anyone mention his name, they smirk and say, "Oh, good luck!"  Just another part of life to deal with. :)
