And when he came out and told the Israelites what he had been commanded, 35 they saw that his face was radiant. Then Moses would put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with the LORD.   Most of this just seems like a historical recounting of events.  The one thing I think I can take from it is the part about Moses being radiant after speaking with God.  The learning Bible says he put the veil over his face so the Israelites wouldn't see the radiance fading, and then took it off to speak with God and became radiant again.  I think that parallels the verse a couple of posts back in John about the light shining through you when you are doing what God wants you to do.  It's the same light, the same radiance, that comes from the inside out when you are close to God.  It's what Bobby has that people can see when they interact with him.  It's the radiance that you get when you're close to God.  I think it's the same thing here, and it's another example of how God can change you from the inside out.
