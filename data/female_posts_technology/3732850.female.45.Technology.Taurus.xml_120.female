Brady explains throughout the essay all of the reasons that she would want a wife and what she would expect them to do. She also writes that if she had a wife she would have the right to find a new wife if she so desired. I get the feeling that Brady, a wife herself, does not like the position that she is in.    There is a very strong idea presented in this essay that wives have many expectations placed on them by there spouse, family, and society. These expectations are expressed in a negative way in this essay. For two entire pages Brady writes phrases and ideas such as, “I want a wife who will take care of my physical needs. I want a wife who will keep my house clean.” “I want a wife who is sensitive to my sexual needs, a wife who makes love passionately and eagerly when I feel like it, a wife who makes sure that I am satisfied.”    I don’t feel that there is anything wrong in wanting a wife to do these things. However, I get the feeling from this essay that Brady does not get the same respect from her spouse as she is expected to put out. I feel that each spouse has a role in there family. If my husband were to make enough money that I could stay home, I would. I would then have no problem doing all of the cooking, cleaning, pleasuring. Reality however, is different. In the real world of today, many families have both spouses working. When this is the case, the husband and wife should share the house hold responsibilities.    I strongly feel that if life is so rough for Brady, then maybe she should start looking for a new husband just as their friend is looking for a new wife.
