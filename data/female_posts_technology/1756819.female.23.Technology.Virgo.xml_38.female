My favourite one is the picture of the baby tiger.  He was only 9 weeks old...just a kitten.  He was in a small cage under a tree, but he really wanted to come out and play.  He kept climbing up the side of his cage and roaring his little roar.  Too bad they grow to be big tigers, it would be fun to have a baby tiger :)
