Carl just farted so loud it rendered all of us speechless and put a hurt on our noses.  This is wrong.  I mean, we all have gas on occassion but he ALWAYS has gas and is always farting loudly.  It will be good for him to be gone the month of July.  Maybe he can go get that terminal flatulence checked out.  ICK.
