See the gym is on my way home from work. So I have no excuse not to go. I also went to school.  I could hardly stay awake while watching my CBTs (Computer-Based Training).  I managed to finish a lab and one CD though.    I have nothing else.  Aside from the fact that at the gym locker rooms, I get amazed at how many women have no problems baring their breasts.  This includes me.  Cause I practically have no breasteses of my own.    Other than than, there's nothing.  Although I did come home to find hubby in the dark, doing Tai-chi in the family room, following a tai-chi DVD he bought.  And then I took a shower, saw that I had no towel, and yelled for him to bring me one. I said please. I think.  But he was still peeved at being interrupted.  He takes these things seriously.  Me, not so much.  But he loves it, so I keep my not so supportive comments to a minimum.  We also watched Le Divorce.  I didn't think it was worth staying up til 1:30 a.m. for.  Other than that, I have nothing to write about.
