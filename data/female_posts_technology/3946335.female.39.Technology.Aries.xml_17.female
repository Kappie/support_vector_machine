When they show the future (usually around 1975) everyone is wearing matching silver jumpsuits and flying around with their jetpack strapped to their back.  I told my fiance that we should get this thing started. We could go get some jumpsuits made and just start wearing them...everyday. Hey, someone has to get this thing started, right?
