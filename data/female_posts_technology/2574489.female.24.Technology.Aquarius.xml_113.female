My weekend was your usual fare of relaxation, Japanese food, and movie, w/ Thai iced tea and boba thrown in for kicks. Yeah, we also watched Man on Fire with Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning...the little girl was actually second billing...love her. I tugged at my hubby's arm during the movie and told him for the umpteenth time that I wanted a baby, preferably a little girl...must fast-forward time to when we can afford one. Or two....  Blah...I don't even have a bedroom fortune to laugh about.
