Doesn't mean I always pay attention to that knowledge and do what is best for me.  So, in a fit of self-pity avoidance (that whole loneliness thing), I left the house at 9:30 last night to go catch a late movie.  Evidently the clothes I threw on for this theater outing (jeans, sweater, mules) were somehow eye catching, because the roomie was coming in as I was going out and said I looked like I was "on the prowl."   Watch out movie patrons!  :o)  Anyway, I headed over to my most favorite of theaters to take in what I expected to be a good movie.  I was not disappointed with The Terminal.  I had someone tell me that it was hard for them to separate Tom Hanks from the Russian-esque character he is portraying.  I didn't have that problem.  I was amused by and felt for this character.  Stanley Tucci plays a classic pain in the a person in charge, and I thought his character should have gotten more of a comeuppance than he did.  Catherine Zeta Jones was stunningly beautiful in a surprisingly realistic female character.  The story was heart-warming, motivating, and honest.   ****ALERT POTENTIAL SPOILER AHEAD**** What typical Hollywood story nowadays would have the romantic relationship not happen?   The truth, while frustrating, was accurately portrayed.  I think it's very powerful that instead of fitting the mold, Spielberg was able to show a realistic situation.  A beautiful, strong, successful woman "waiting" for an unavailable man. Drawn to, yet unsure of how to react to, the sweet good-natured man who is available and taken with her.  And in the end going back to the jerk because it's what she thinks she wants or deserves.  Powerful.    So I did enjoy this movie, and will probably add it to my DVD collection some day....it will be a good stitch-a-long movie.  Oh, while Hanks gives a great performance as usual, it's not better than Forrest Gump.  ;)  On another review note, I spent some time yesterday skulking about the new JK Rowlings official website ( urlLink www.jkrowling.com ).  For any Harry Potter fan, it's a must visit.  She's got some nifty little clues to extra tidbits, and I appreciate her response to rumors and such.  Very entertaining....now if I can just figure out how to get past that sill brick wall......you'll know what I mean when you visit the site.  Oh yeah....I discovered the hard way last night that I'm not going to be able to leave the cats unattended on the patio anymore...at least not until I get the lattice stuff attached to the lower fence.  Bailey, mischief maker extraordinare got through the temporary blockade.  And of course Chloe followed her.  Luckily they didn't go far and were recaptured quickly.  Hopefully I can have that fixed in the next few days.  It's retirement grand central around Metro today.  Those who took part in the retirement incentive offer are on their last day.  There are lunches and little gatherings most of the day.  I'm working on some document updates, so I'll have my micro-meal at home and enjoy some cake and punch at the department celebration this afternoon.  Have I mentioned recently that I'm SO ready for my vacation next week!?!?!?  :o)
