I was sort of pushed out, but no hard feelings some people just have a lot of growing up to do.  Moving right along here...I am almost done w/ this song I am working on.  I must have changed it like 100x. When I am done gonna play if for Mike and if he likes it then I will fly out to track it.  I also started working on another song. Yeah I know I should finish this one first, but Mike gave me an idea and then some stuff popped in my head. I did not want to loose it or forget it so I started writing it down. Talked to Matt (Boston) through IM for a while. These people are really nice and I am so glad to have met them. I think the most important thing is that they are all REAL! I am so sick and tired of fake people I could just puke! LOL I am actually getting to explore a different side of music yet still do it my way. We will see if Mike and Steve like it. What could be the worst that happens? THEY HATE IT! LOL
