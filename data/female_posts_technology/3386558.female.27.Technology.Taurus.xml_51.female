"you can't smell your own shit on your knees."  they may have some bad luck, some unpleasant experiences, but even those have a happy ending. the final result is even better than the one they were hoping for. they don't necessarily have to be beautiful, but most of the time, they do have some kind of aesthetically pleasing quality the other sex simply cannot resist. they are magnets. other people want to be around them, to hang on their every word. they are the leaders, the herders with their own flock of sheep following. they have a "natural charm". all of their clouds have silver linings. they do not need to ooze intelligence; the basics are sufficient. they do not wax philosophic to make the crowds gather; they simply need to open their mouths. my point is: they don't have to try. there is no effort involved in making friends or picking someone up. it just magically happens. no reason for it really; it simply is. it's like breathing for them. it's an involuntary reaction to stimuli around them.   at times, we envy the life they lead. it seems so easy. we question why we complicate our lives with questions  LIKE  "why?" why can't we just accept things the way they are? why do we need to improve anything? why is there never enough time? why did he say that? why didn't i know that? why, why, why?   i would like to know some other opinions on the beautiful people. i know that my definition is not really sufficient enough. it is merely a beginning. see, i need to improve it. i need to make it bigger, better, stronger, faster. so help me out. comments?
