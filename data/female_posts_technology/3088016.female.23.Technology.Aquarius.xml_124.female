He wasn't asking in a judgy kind of way, he's done it too, but it really is a good question.  The first reason that I use the internet is that I am busy.  I am a struggling realtor just trying to get as much business as possible.  Sometimes I am not home until late and don't want to go out.  With a traditional job you can go to happy hour, but that is not often in the cards for me.    The next reason is something that may be difficult to understand.  I am an extremely social person.  I have friends all over this town and am invited to really cool events.  You're probably thinking well what's the problem?  I think that the problem with that is I am so unapproachable when I'm out and about because I'm always engaged in conversation with some friend I haven't seen in a while.   Finally, I just can't get into that meat market groove.  When I see somebody that I'd like to meet, I am too shy to approach.  When somebody starts talking to me, I am often clueless to the fact that they would like to get to know me.    I am a very nice person, but sometimes appear to be aloof to new people.  I think that an internet date gets alot of that out of the way.  It's like I'd like to meet somebody, you'd like to meet somebody, so we are here to see if we click.    What do you think?
