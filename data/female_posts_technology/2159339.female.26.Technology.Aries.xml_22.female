It is time to stop the madness because it only exists in my head and I should stop nurturing it and feeding it with scraps of libido and imagination. I am changing my ways! From now on I will use this blog to document moments of mortification. Those are what make us human, what make us real. Well,  I  feel really real anyway... because  I  have to deal with the consequential and guaranteed embarrassment...   Yesterday as I was trying to catch the elevator for myself I stuck my arm between the closing doors. Usually the doors bounce off, right? Wrong! Those dumb doors crushed my flimsy measly arm and kept going. They wanted to close all the way. This arm was no obstacle to their destructive path of closure.  I felt like a muppet with my arm stuck in an elevator, jumping and wiggling around frantically.  Except I was no muppet. Unfortunately, I was me, and unfortunately there was another person in the lobby who witnessed this tawdry spectacle.
