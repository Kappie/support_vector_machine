But after I left, some of them managed to go clubbing. (is it me? hahaha)  So what do you do after work? Home straight to baby sit?   For me, I tried to go exercise at Amore at least once a week. (It's not enough, I know) I used to play pool every other week but that has decrease recently. And on rare occassion, catch up with friends over dinner. Recently have been thinking of picking up something to enrich myself. I need to be more motivated to go for yoga and pilates. I need to find people to play pool to practise. And I am also looking at any art classes that I can take to pursue my interest. I was also thinking of picking up violin, but but but.. expensive leh. And it takes motivation and determination. I still haven't develop the same kind of interest in violin as in art.   But ultimately, I need to do my financials cos my contract is ending in a few months, and Sybase still can't decide if they have the budget to keep me. (Or maybe they are not telling.)  I'm thinking of going to the Arts Museum tomorrow, anyone wanna join me? Hahaha. It's free for admission on Fridays, 6-9pm.
