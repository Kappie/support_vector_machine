Having an issue w/ my single life right now.  In many ways I want and like being single because of my life and what it entails.  I can't handle many things that go along w/ relationships. On the other hand as I watch my married friends and some of my friends getting married I start to wonder if I will be alone my whole life!  Maybe I will be the cat lady! OMG. I can see it now. Right now my focus is on the band, my family and friends (not necessarily in that order) Although my friends seem to think I have fallen off the face of the earth.  I have not hung out w/ anyone in over a month. I saw Mike yesterday when I picked up my mic cable from Axis music.  He was so weird towards me cause I am never around. Oh well he will get over it. Need to get my butt back to work. Oh yeah and I will be putting my archives back soon.
