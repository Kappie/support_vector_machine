What is your opinion on recent low carb craze?   I have no opinion really. I know that low carb does work because I've lost weight on those type of diets before. But the "craze?" No opinion really.   3. Do you wake up when you have to, or do you stall / snooze for longer?   Much to my own detriment, I never wake up when I need to...always resulting in me being 10 minutes late to work.
