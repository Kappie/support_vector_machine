James Calk, 26, was released from the Arkansas Department of Corrections last week after serving his entire six-year sentence for aggravated assault. He is not on parole. After his release, Calk boarded a Greyhound bus bound for San Diego. While in prison, Calk wrote letters to his mother describing his intentions and desires to become a serial rapist and murderer like Jeffrey Dahmer and Ted Bundy, according to police. He described that he wants to see his victims "scream and cry, beg, mourn, and weep and feel pain and agony because that's what turns me on." Arkansas officials tried to commit Calk for mental health reasons, but they were unsuccessful. San Diego Police Lt. Mike Hurley said Calk has no contacts in San Diego and it is unknown why he chose to come to this city. Police surveilled the San Diego Greyhound Bus Depot at the estimated time of his arrival, but Calk was not on the bus. However, the bus had stopped at several cities along the way, including El Cajon and San Ysidro. It is unknown if Calk is in the San Diego area but if he is, investigators should be aware of him, Hurley said. Calk was in the maximum security unit due to his history of violence. Calk is described as a Caucasian with brown hair and brown eyes. He is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 237 pounds.
