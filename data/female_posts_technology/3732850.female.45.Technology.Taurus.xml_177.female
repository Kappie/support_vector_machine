When you see a person that may have special needs, or maybe they talk differently, we tend to tune them out and not acnowlege them. I see people all the time doing this because i work with a child that has mental dissabilities. THis child also has a hard time in social experiences. When she meets new people she tends to latch on to them and thinks that everyone is her best friend. SHe doesn't see the looks that some people make at her. I hope that never changes. She doesn't need to see them at her age. she does not know how to discriminate. She will play with those older than her and those younger than her. I wish that no one could make someone feel differently. We are all the same and we are all different. WHat makes the difference is how we treat others and how we treat our selves. When a person cannot respect their own self then there is no way that they can care about or even respect another person. When i was about 13 years old, I was teased and ridiculed. I always was the but of anyones jokes, and was not really liked be anyone. I had a very good friend though that has kept me from continuing this disrespect. They taught me that the people that had made fun of me jsut felt insecure about themselves so they teased me to make themselves feel better. I hopethat someday this child that i take care of can see that it is not right to make fun of someone else jsut because they are unhappy with their lives. I hope that maybe people will be able to see her for the sweet, caring, and talented young lady that she is becoming and not discriminater against her. John Hockenberry's Essay "Limited Seating on Broadway" stated it best. " It is the forum and agent for chalenging America's hardend perceptions about race, politics, class, gender, religion and more recently AIDS and homophobia." All of these people are are all different from us but they are also the same. We need to remember that.
