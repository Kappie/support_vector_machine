He opeing sentance was using great emotion and imagery and I feel there is not to many other words of choice to tell you how well he does throughout the essay with using in great depth what it was like in the prison on a exceution day. A good example of the author's imagery start like this " Two of them stood by with rifles and fixed bayonets, while the others handcuffed him, passed a chain through his handcuffs and fixed it to their belts, and lashed his arms tight to his sides." To me this gives me great imagination what the prisoner was going through and what the guards were doing.
