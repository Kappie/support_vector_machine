I have something I have wanted to share with all the single men and women out there about my worst dating experience, but have never had a place to begin my tale.      When I turned 37, I was pretty determined to find the man for me and get married. One day out of nowhere, I recieved a call from a dating service telling me they wanted to survey my experience. I had previously responded to a personal ad I found in a publication I picked up at Cafe Artiste and thought they were referring to that. So I agreed to go in and talk to them.      It was actually Together Dating Service. I was put into a room and given a hard sale by one of their reps. I decided that since it was a goal of mine to be married, it might be worth the incredible sum of money to join.      The gist of their program is that you fill out a thing about yourself and what you are looking for in a mate so they can find you the perfect match. Sounded good to me. How substantial can a relationship be if it is founded only on physical attraction? Doesn't this process help you get to the chase?      Well first of all, I quickly discovered that there were no qualifications for the people making matches. As a matter of fact, I don't even think they read my profile. It said, clear as day that I'm an atheist. They set me up with several born again Christian men. I had also indicated that I didn't want to date anyone outside the beltway and that I preferred meeting people close to where I lived or out towards the galleria. I guess they thought Conroe, Katy and Pasadena fit in that area.      All told, I went out with 23 men. By about number 19, I was screening them myself over the phone before even agreeing to meet them in person. They were sending me 2 and 3 intros a week. I was discovering that very few women were in this organization. While I was getting 2 - 3 intros a week, these guys are getting 1 - 2 intros a month. There was a lot of pressure on them to make something click since the opportunities were so few and far between.      Bottom line is I was absolutely miserable. I am so angry by the lack of care and respect they held for their patrons. It is a money scam from day one.      If anyone wants to join a dating service such as Together, DO NOT FOCUS ON THE NUMBER OF MEMBERS in their membership. That is what they want you to see. YOU GET THEM TO SHOW YOU IN WRITING WHAT THEIR SUCCESS RATE IS IN CREATING SUCCESSFUL MATCHES. Because I promise you, you mix enough men and women together, you're going to get some matches. But they gave me the impression that they did more than just throw people together.      It isn't worth the investment.
