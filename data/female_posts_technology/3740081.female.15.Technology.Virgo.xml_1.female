I watched I Love the 80's like an idiot watches grass grow. Awesome stuff. Only this time I can remember crap. So...Hal Sparks, Michael Ian Black, Rachael Harris, and the rest of the crew are comin' back, and I can't wait to laugh my ass off. *grins*    In Other News    THE BEASTIE BOYS RETURN!  Sha-zam-an'-abra-kadabra!    Featured Music Videos    "Breaking the Habit" by Linkin Park   Okay, if you haven't seen the latest video from Lnkin Park, then I suggest you go to Yahoo Launch or something to see it, because it's just better. I loved this video for a number of reasons.   1. I am a huge, huge Linkin Park fan and have been from the very start.   2. It's anime-like. I like Japanese anime and Americanized anime. It's all in the beauty of the artwork, and yes---the angst of the characters and the storyline. Who doesn't want to see Inuyasha cream his enemies, Tsukasa struggle to remember his purpose in the World, or robots kick the shit out of each other?   3. Th lyrics are very inspiring. More on that in a minute.   The rough yet graceful textures of dark-filled emotion pop out at you. You almost need to hear the song, but once you read the lyrics, the anime video and the song form in your head. This song is cryptic to me, as are most Linkin Park songs that I can name off (and that's all of them). Breaking the Habit, to me, is the story of a person who has their troubles constantly from some habit---whatever it may be---and they knkow if they don't stop, it will tear them apart. That is to say, slowly destroy or kill them. They try to break the habit, but it gets the better of them. Finally, after much trama, they vow to break the habit tonight.   Anyway, the lyrics go like this:   "Memories consume  Like opening the wound  I'm picking me apart again  You all assume  I'm safe here in my room  Unless I try to start again   I don't want to be the one  The battles always choose  'cause inside I realize  That I'm the one confused   I don't know what's worth fighting for  Or why I have to scream  I don't know why I instigate  And say what I don't mean  I don't know how I got this way  I know it's not alright  So I'm  Breaking the habit  I'm breaking the habit  Tonight   Clutching my cure  I thightly lock the door  I try to catch my breath again  I hurt much more  Than any time before  I had no options left again   I don't want to be the one  The battles always choose  'cause inside I realize  That I'm the one confused   I don't know what's worth fighting for  Or why I have to scream  I don't know why I instigate  And say what I don't mean  I don't know how I got this way  I know it's not alright  So I'm  Breaking the habit  I'm breaking the habit  Tonight   I'll paint it on the walls  'cause I'm the one at fault  I'll never fight again  And this is how it ends   I don't know what's worth fighting for  Or why I have to scream  But now I have some clarity  To show you what I mean  I don't know how I got this way  I know it's not alright  So I'm  Breaking the habit  I'm breaking the habit  I'm breaking the habit  Tonight   After you see/hear the music video, it's no wonder why it took six long years before the band felt anything could do it justice. The video reminds me of the future---possibly the pressent---just shown as darker. Finally, after some interestingly portrayed anime angst, we see our very own Linkin Park peeps---lead vocalist Chester Bennington (I have a MAD crush on him!!); vocalist, emcee, and sampler (plus other stuff) Mike Shinoda; along with Phoenix the bassist; Rob Bourdon the percussionist; Mr. Hahn the recorder and sampler (put Mike and Mr. Hahn together and you have *KA-CHING* MUSIC BLING AND PRETTY SOUNDS); and Brad Delson the guitarist. They are anime-ed and are singing/playing the song on top of a building, it looks like. Very nice finishing touch, and then the last thing you see is that cool...um...spinning thing...you have to see it.   All in all, it was a wonderfully done video. I can't wait for their next album, and I sit here wishing I could see them on their Projekt Revolution tour. In the meantime I faithfully bang my head to each and every one of their songs in my CD player. Linkin Park is truly the hot shit.    "So Cold" by Breaking Benjamin   Believe it or not, this is the first song I have heard from Breaking Benjamin, and I've got less to say on it, but all together I loved the darkness of hte video and song and I can't help but wonder if there is something subliminal about the video/song.   Anyway, the song sounds both angry and dramatic. It looks as if the young man is carrying the "concrete block" as a punishment for something he did. It also looks like it's chained to him, so he can't get away from it, even if he tried. Older people are following him. Maybe they are family, for they looked sorrowful.   Now, to me, I couldn't quite tell what these people were; they all were dressed up in black and in a certain way. I would have guessed Amish or Jewish because mostly all of them had dark hair, but if they aren't, and you happen to be Amish or Jewish, DO NOT TAKE OFFENSE and please DO NOT ATTACK YOUR COMPUTER, BURN THINGS, VANDALIZE A BOY'S LOCKER-ROOM, ROB A VINTAGE STORE, SMASH YOUR BROTHER WITH GUITARS, OR OTHER DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIORAL ACTIVITIES. But wait...if you're Amish, then you wouldn't have electricity, which means you wouldn't have an outlet to plug stuff in, which means you wouldn't have the Internet nor a computer, which means you'd never read this! So HA!   *silence*   Ahem.   Anyway, the song has some meaning in the fact that HARD ROCK KICKS AZZ. Wanna fight?   And for some reason, I have "When I Come Around" (by Green Day) stuck in my head. Okay wutevah.   The video gives out a little creepiness with a backround melody...I'll see if I can't practice on my handy-dandy keyboard. The scenery is awesome.   So the moral of the story is,   WATCH IT.     Games    Star Fox is just one of the games in the EÂ³ 2004 (Electronic Entertainment Expo 2004). Nintendo Power has taken an inside look at some hot new games coming out for hte GCN and GBA. They also unleashed a little powersystem called the "Nintendo DS". And---well---look 'er up for yourself. Some titles for the GCN worth looking out for include: Metroid Prime 2: Echoes; Resident Evil 4; Star Fox; Geist; StarCraft: Ghost; Advance Wars: Under Fire; Prince of Persia; Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow; Goldeneye: Rogue Agent (yes that's right, it's a Bond game only this time you are NOT MI6. I think.), and others.   I was most excited at the news of another Star Fox game, bringing Fox McCloud back into the pilot's cockpit of his beloved Arwing. Joining him once again is my favorite gung-ho, kick-ass, take-no-crap-from-nobody avian, Falco Lombardi. Unfortunately I have reason to believe that a valued crew member will die (and my predictions tend to be right...*sigh*). But they say both the storyline and multiplayer gaming are awesome. And some good space battles and inter-planetary fights are what I'm looking forward to. Only question: Is the villian once again the deposed evil emperor Andross? And are the members of the Star Wolf team still alive? Only time wil tell. The game is scheduled to release this November.   StarCraft is finally staying away from the PC and launching StarCraft: Ghost, where you are a Confederate---what else---ghost specialist. But I can't wait for some good, alien butt-kickin' fun, and it looks promising.   Lastly is the short movie clip of an upcoming Legend of Zelda game due to release sometime in 2005. It features an adult Link---and let's face it, folks: Link looks hot. The graphics are beautiful. All three games are a must for me.   Cheers!   ~Valkyrie Juno signing off~
