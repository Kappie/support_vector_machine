The feeling of sand-blown desolation sweeps throughout this album from first single ‘The Letter’ through ‘The Pocket Knife’, ‘The Life And Death of Mr. Badmouth’ and ‘Cat On The Wall’. It’s not all QOTSA menace though...   The Darker Days of Me and Him  urlLink PJ Harvey;   Promises, promises I'm feeling burned You taught me a lesson I didn't want to learn  Why did I come here? Please tell me again Why did you ask me? Don't say you forget  I long for, I long for I long for my home I long for a land where No man was ever known  With no neurosis And no psychosis No psychoanalysis And no sadness  I'll pick up the pieces I'll carry on somehow Tape the broken parts together And limp this love around  Limp this love around Limp this love around Limp this love around Limp this love around
