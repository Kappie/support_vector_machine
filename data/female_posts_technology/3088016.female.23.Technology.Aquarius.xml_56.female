    
       I have now inspired two people to create a blog.  In addition to John and his  urlLink travel blog , my friend Angie has decided to create  urlLink a blog  for the Thirtysomething dating crowd.  Her plan is that people can share dating stories, the good, bad, and the ugly, on the site.  One person actually already posted something that seems to be exactly what she's looking for - a warning about a personals service.    I've been asked to do some of the webmaster duties on the blog, since I have this one and seem to have done an okay job with making at least a part of it my own creation.  Last night, I added some Links to the sidebar and an Upcoming Events calendar.  I was going to post on my own blog for my loyal readers (well, there's at least one of you), but the medicine I got from the dentist made me drowsy.
