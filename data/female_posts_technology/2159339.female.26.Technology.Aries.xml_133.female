           
       The Man is Trying to Kill the Love   Today I found out that I have to sit at reception from 12pm-1pm to cover the receptionist's lunch break from now until eternity. That is usually my break. That is usually XX's break. That is usually the 1 hour island of time that I get to gaze fondly into XX's eyes while stuffing my face with food: my two favorite things to do.   But I'm not worried. Because in the end, love conquers all. And by love, I mean carnal desire.
