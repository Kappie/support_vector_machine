Her red hair was like a banner telling everyone that she was a witch the same as her mother.  Her mother also dyed her hair for she had to hide too.  They had their own hut at the edge of the village and everyone avoided them even though there was never any proof of the craft.    Morrigan glanced at her mother working at the table making the supper meal before turning back to glance out the door.  She watched the villagers move about their daily lives completing errands before their last meal of the day.  She wished she could accepted as a member of this village but she knew it would never be so.  She definitely didn't wish to give up her powers for she did like the fact that she was special in that way.    "Morrigan?  Where did your mind take you today?"  Her mother asked quietly as she placed a hand on Morrigan's shoulder.  "I'm sorry, mom.  I am feeling slightly out of sorts today.  I realize that this day is special but I can't help but think about things."  Morrigan squeezed her mom's hand before looking out the door again.  "Why don't you go for a quick walk before our meal.  It will be ready in fifteen minutes but that is time enough for a walk and fresh air.  You have been holed up here all day practicing the craft so now is your time."  Her mother pushed her out the door without any say so Morrigan moved away from the hut.  Before she had moved ten steps, Aidan called out.  "Morrigan, wait up."  Morrigan waited for Aidan to catch up.  He was her best friend and always seemed to be around when she was either into trouble or feeling sad.  Maybe he had some craft inside him as well.  She smiled.  "Hello Aidan.  How is your family?"  Morrigan asked politely.  "They are well and how is your mother?"  Aidan also asked politely.  "She is well.  How have your day been?"  Again very polite.  "My day has been good.  Today was such a nice day that I thought I would see you but I didn't.  What have you been doing all day?"  Aidan asked forgoing the niceties.  "Oh, I have been busy learning cures from my mother so I am stuck to the hut during the day while I learn though every now and then we get to come outside to pick herbs in the woods."  Morrigan answered with a practiced lie that seemed to work over the years.  "That's good to learn medicine.  You will be able help the villagers just like your mother."  Aidan said with a smile.    "Morrigan, come back inside and eat."  Morrigan's Mother yelled from the hut.    "Talk to you later Aidan.  Have a good night."  Morrigan smiled as she turned back to the hut.  "Good night to you as well."  Aidan moved away quietly.  Morrigan walked into the hut and sat down to eat the supper meal with complete silence with another plate on the table for any otherworldly visitors tonight.  She smiled at her mother before eating quietly thinking of the past.    To my husband
