But that said I honestly wasn't paying that much attention to the game simply because I was still recovering from Friday night...whooo hooo!! It is also the main reason why I do NOT have parties at my home. Nasty-ness ground into my already funky carpet only serve to remind me of the fact that I have a very grimy and slap-shot home. Ah well. 'tis the life of a busy working girl...But so far my birthday has been very good to me...Although I do have blisters forming on my fingers...  - dirty boys....I've got the blisters because I got a guitar for my birthday. I'm learning to play solo guitar....*tisk, tisk* dirty minds all ya'll
