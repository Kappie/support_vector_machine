I get a headache just thinking about it. And it turns a smile into a frown. There are a few people that wish to live vicariously through me in this experience.  And then, of course, there are those, like myself, that think that I am just plain nuts. (and I myself, am beginning to wonder) I think what the whole idea is supposed to be is taking that leap off the ledge... the departing from your life into another... wondering if it can really happen.  If things will just fall into place? I'd love advice if anyone has done something radical like this... words of encouragement, or words like "you'd better do this first or you really are a coconut short..."
