Or is it coz I just have too many things on my mind that I'm losing memory space to include the usual wake up routine: bathe, dress up, put make up on, blow dry hair, take your hand bag, laptop, handphone, and car keys, kiss Angel  Daisy, start the engine and off to work.... could it be due to the cigarettes I've been smoking all these years? Or can I conclude that, there it is again, one of those days when "shit happens".   I'm having a new theory that was inspired by my friend the SECOND time I left my handphone at home... My handphone's no longer a priority to me.... No more I come up with a statement "gosh, cant live without my mobile, cant imagine a life without it in the first place" I'm beginning to feel I CAN live a normal life without it... Without people calling me and bugging me... Without my mom checking on my whereabouts... Without my friends calling me out for lunch... Without stupid tele-sales marketer calling me up to annoy me with their much wasteful services. My mobile is no longer my pride and joy which it used to be... It's just another device to reach other homosapiens....Or for others to reach me...Be it a call or SMS or MMS. I do admit one thing for sure... With the existence of my mobile since I was 18, I haven't remembered any of my friends or families phone numbers! So surely this has emptied some memory space in my brain.... Therefore, I'm sure I have a little space in my mature brain to remember my handphone with that normal wake-up routine I've setup.   Perhaps it is true that my handphone IS no longer my priority... Come with the subsequent curiosity, what happened? What changed and made my mobile no longer a priority? Has my life changed so much that I don't need to keep constant contact with other homosapiens and do not mind not being able to contact friends and families? I don't use the office phone for personal calls for sure.... No one calls me thru my office phone as well.... Except for Citibank... Even my boss gets me thru my mobile!   Sheeeshh.... Hopefully by end of the week I can figure this thing out... Right now, other priority awaits... Incubus concert!! Gosh.. I cant believe they're coming here to perform!! Cant wait to go to the concert tonite...Wait for my review on it tomorrow! Now if only I can figure out how to call my "twin" to confirm the time to meet up and go for the concert...
