I'm only going to dread one day at a time."   --Charles Schultz     Stupid, stupid, stupid....WELL, I might be having to update my resume sooner than I thought. Stupid, stupid, stupid. I had forwarded an email from Jildo to myself at home so I could reply to it away from work. SO what do I do????? I get on there and rant and rave and not about the evil one at work, oh no. I get mouthy about the whole damn place, my low pay, the way things are done, and the frustrations of the days in the cellar. OF course I hit reply and send, thinking I'm sending it to Jildo, NO I sent it to myself at WORK. If they are monitoring email, I'm screwed. screwed screwed screwed.  I have too much crap in my office to be fired. The way they do things around there, it's a first thing in the morning while everyone else is in a meeting or last thing in the day get rid of you quick without any warning. It's kind of like Sprint used to be. It'd take me at least 3 trips to load all my personal crap out to the car. I'd be so mortified that I'd probably leave most of it behind rather than go up and down those stairs. STUPID STUPID STUPID.  You know, I can be a brave, mouthy person once in a while to blow off steam. I know it's hard to imagine me spouting off my mouth, but it happens once in a while. STUPID STUPID STUPID.  Well, I guess we'll find out as the owners that used to love me are coming to town next week.  The sad thing is, after I ranted and raved on email and pouted for about a week I had decided I was staying put at least until I got the teaching certificate thing which would take at least 2 years from now.  Man, I am gonna have to cross my fingers  toes here.  Oh well, what's the worst that can happen?  They fire me?  Unemployment would be ok while looking for something else I guess.  We'll see.  The hard thing is the main owner and I seemed to really have a good connection, and I'd be scared of pissing her off.  Yup, I'm a wimp.
