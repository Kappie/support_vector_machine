Brian asked if he could go in with me when I was going in there to pay.  He kept holding myhand and saying...I love you mommy. I love you mommy.  Of course I was telling him I love him too.   Well when they left he kept calling me, just to say I love you and to chat.  I finally asked him what is wrong because Brian does not really like to stay on the phone and talk.  He told me he did not want to go at all today.  He says that alot...but today...I know he is serious.  After I talked to Him he talked to his Daddy.   After talking to his daddy, Stacey called and demanded to have Brain for 30 days.   That is not how it works.  It is not what is in his divorce papers.   After both of them cussed at Ken we called our attorney.  He in turn called them and let them know that we will be filing for a clarification of terms, and that they could keep my baby for a week.  But we must get him back.  will finish later.   6/6/03 Well it sounds as if we wont get our baby through the summer except for weekends.  UUGGHH....I will miss him sooo much.....  I want all 4 of my kids around all the time.    I really hate that his mom wants him to be around the abuse that goes on in that house.   I know we are basing it on what a 5 year old says...but I know he would not make up what he has said.
