Because of his wisdom, God was able to create the world knowing perfectly well how it would have to work.  He made the entire earth, the oceans, streams, and rivers, and the sky, clouds, and rain.  It was his wisdom that allowed him to know exactly how to make the world.  We should use our wisdom too, to make sound decisions, using our best judgment at all times.  We should always keep those things in the front of our minds so we can make our decisions based on what God would want us to do.  Then we can be safe and secure that we are going down the right path, without fear or stress or concerns.  We'll be able to sleep well at night knowing everything is in order.  Another way to look at the "God takes care of the details" thing.  I just need to make sure I'm on the right path -- using my best judgment and wisdom based on what I'm learning in the Bible is the way I should be living my life -- and everything else will work itself out.  I don't need to be afraid or have fears of the future, where I'm going to end up career-wise, whether I'm making the right decisions on a job, all of that.  It will work out.  God will handle the details.  And he's guiding me along anyway.  So I can take a deep breath and relax.
