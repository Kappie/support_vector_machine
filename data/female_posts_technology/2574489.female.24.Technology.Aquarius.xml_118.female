Both from Empress of China Restaurant  ***   Let me tell you....   Woody and I had Japanese food to the gills, visiting Lava Grill twice over the weekend. Yummy Udon Noodle soup for hubby, California and Avocado rolls for both of us, and shrimp tempura for me.  Plus salad with that great ginger dressing and miso soup!  We watched Kill Bill on Friday night....AWESOME!  I was imitating Pai Mei's laugh all weekend (Uma's trainer).   We also visited the Main Street Arts Festival.  As promised, here are pics:           Click  urlLink here  for more pictures. We had a great time!
