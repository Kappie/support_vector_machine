Anyways, my point with the original post, which I cannot really duplicate, was the fact that I have been writing in journals for years. I have actually had one particular journal going on two years now that I haven't finished. I should write more often, because I notice that once I empty some of my thoughts onto paper, my head feels less fuzzy, and I have more clarity and room for new ideas.      I think the main reason I don't write more often is because my hands are just lazy. It's hard holding a pen and moving my hand around a page. It seems easier just to type, although the act of typing can get pretty tiring as well.      We will see how this goes. I am looking forward to blogging, been thinking about it for awhile, and now I've finally taken the plunge. Hope my next entry is not only soon, but topical.      shawn
