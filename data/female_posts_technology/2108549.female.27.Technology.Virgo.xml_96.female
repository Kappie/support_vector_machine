It was crazy and some days were better than others, but I survived.  I am making new friends at working, getting closer to my new friends at home, just in general, doing life.  I am starting to find out that I am likeable, maybe even to the point that people seek me out to spend time with me rather than simply tolerating my presence.  Its an odd thing to learn this late in life. To think that people think I am optimistic and perky is just very strange for me.  It seems the person I was is fading and the person I am becoming is shining.
