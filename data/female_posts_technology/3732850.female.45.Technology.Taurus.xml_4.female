I have been waiting for two years to go camping my husband would always say "We are going camping this weekend." We FINALLY went and it was good every one in the family helped set up the tent and get the fire going to cook our hotdogs and the couple fish that my son only caught, he was happy because he really doesn't like hotdogs.    I have never had so much fun camping this time, when I was a kid that's all we did was camp out we never lived in a home in the summer we only lived in a home when we were in school. I can't remember when we ever lived in a house. Our house was the tent that was set up in the KOA camp grounds or a old logging trail which ever one my father wanted to go to.    I never liked camping when I was a kid and my kids had fun and that made me happy. My proud son got to drive our Explorer and he did good according to my husband.
