Kind of amazing, especially as it only lasted a few hours.  And I think I was asleep for those hours...  I believe as soon as I woke up the next day, I called a friend (no phone was one of my restrictions) and made plans to go over to her house (again, not allowed).  L has already made it clear that she and I are going out for our usual Friday evening tonight, to celebrate my "smurfdom".  I'm not half as excited about this as she is, as it's a wake-up call of sorts to say that in just over two years, I've amassed three million points playing trivia and drinking beer (wine, bourbon, vodka...).  So out tonight and grounded the rest of the weekend.  Unless, of course, I call a friend and invite myself over.  :)
