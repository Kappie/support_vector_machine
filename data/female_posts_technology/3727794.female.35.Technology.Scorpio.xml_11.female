Nothing is solved and it just makes you walk funny."    --Kathryn Carpenter       Worked out yesterday, great workout except one thing...had to wear a black thong so my dress wouldn't have granny-panty-lines at work, and forgot to stick the normal cottonundies in the old workout bag. Yup, stairmaster in a thong is not a good thing. Enough said.
