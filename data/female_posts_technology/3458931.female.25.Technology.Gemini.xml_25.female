I have so much more to share; thoughts on politics, the environment, comic books.   So Saturday I will return the cat carrier to M and say "Adieu". Buddists say that ill-will towards people is a negative force we should be wary of, so I'm going to make a concentrated effort to be especially nice and watch what I say. If I think this "new M" is only going to find emptiness in his new lifestyle I will keep it to myself (and my weblog).   I'm excited about the prospect of camping next week, and I think I have a lot to look forward to this summer. I think I might try getting out and meeting new people. I'm certainly not interested in a new relationship right away, but I'm not averse to dating. I created a profile on  urlLink lavalife.com  yesterday and had about 5 smiles within a few hours! Granted, some of these guys were over fourty but still it's a nice ego boost. If you'd like to see my profile on lavalife my username is _paprika_.
