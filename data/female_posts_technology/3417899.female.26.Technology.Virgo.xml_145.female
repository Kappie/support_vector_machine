I managed to get my self involved in my own little scandal (which could, potentially, cost me my job).   I am sure my loyal readers are not interested in the gory details of how I managed to screw up (again), and I am not in the mood for a long, whiny post, so here are the highlights of the latest drama in my life: - Every employee at my company is issued a personal calling card to be used for work related calls. It is customary that it be used for "reasonable" amount of personal calls. - I was using a colleague's company calling card instead of my own for a while (mine wasn't working), nothing too serious here.  - I gave my parents the calling card one day, when they had an emergency and no other way to call each other.  - My parents assumed (and I didn't correct them) the calling card was my own - They did not know it was a company card and my company pays for it - As my parents have been living apart for several months now (due to the financial issues I whine about every now and then) they have been using my card (assuming I'd pay for it and add it to their ever-growing debt). They've been using it  a lot . $2000 in the past month (They've had some rough times).  - My company received the bill and started a police investigation for fraud (!!!) - As soon as the story found its way to me I let everyone know I was responsible for this and I'd pay all the expenses immediately.   This could have ended here. It was a mistake. They didn't know. I'll pay it all. End of story.  But no, now it's about trust, and honor and whatnot. My managers, being the Israelis they are - are certain I have been trying to "pull a fast one" and defraud my company by racking up personal calls on their check, and knowing the blame would fall on my colleague (owner of the card). (I'd think, after 5.5 years with them, having gone through so much and proven myself over and over, there'd be a little more trust, but hey - that's me).  Anyways - the powers to be are holding meeting after meeting to see what should be done to the felon (that, my friends, is me).   So there you have it - from the shooting star in the company to a menace to society - all in one day.  Yeah, I'm exaggerating, but hey - I'm a bit emotional here.  I'll just have to hang tight, brace myself, repeat the words "No malicious intent" and "I'm sorry" and many times as humanly possible, and wait for this to blow over.   Now can I curl up and go back to bed?
