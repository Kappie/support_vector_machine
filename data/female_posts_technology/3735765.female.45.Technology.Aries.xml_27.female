Matthew 6:30  and  Matthew 6:31    Matthew 6:32  and  Matthew 6:33  refers to God knowing our needs and Him supplying what we actually need on a daily basis as we continue living our lives for Him.  My own Grandma and Big Mama (ironically called that because she was Grandma's mother; she was extremely tall and skinny!) served as prime examples and role models of living their lives for Him.  Without fail they both taught Sunday School each and every week of their adult lives in a small Christian Church in a small Texas town, raised vegetables and fruits and shared their wealth through baking breads and jellies to share with others, made their own quilts, sewed clothes for the grandchildren, had patience while teaching others about gardening and sewing, and lived very simplistic lives.  I think many of us tend to forget our roots and look for the same glimmers in the materialistic world that never seems to satisfy us as a whole.  Mansions are great -- but would be better served in housing the homeless, perhaps.    How much is too much?  The answer to this is probably when it consumes your every moment for existence on this earth to achieve the greatest wealth of all, when all we need to do is look at our own hearts and understand the wealth we achieve each and every day -- especially, when we help others to improve their quality of life (empowering them to help themselves through a variety of resources in the communities), when we get ourselves involved with helping others (there are so many non-profit organizations that are just clammering at the bit for volunteers), and when we are just being prepared to listen to our friends, family, and strangers that we encounter (not necessarily in that order).  Many people quote  Matthew 6:34  without realizing that they are quoting it directly from the Bible.  It is appropriate, though, to end this blog with the words from the verse of  Matthew 6:34 :  "So don't worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring its own worries.  Today's trouble is enough for today."  Isn't that a great thought for today???
