My name is Lynn.  Nice to meet you!" and is one of the few phrases of Japanese I'm really good at besides from, "I only speak a little Japanese", "Do you take dollars?" or "I forgot my San A card today"; the latter, in a very polite form takes a good 5 minutes to present to the poor cashier who is giving you that please-hurry-and-make-this-moment-pass look.  As I said my name is Lynn. I'm a 27 year old Californian living in Okinawa, Japan with my active-duty husband. I've lived here a little over two years. I have two girls 4 and 1 1/2. This blog isn't really about fun places to take your family, or about my family in general, but witty (hopefully) observations and truths about life in Japan.  My situation is a little unique because I'm not:  1. An ex-military member married to a Japanese national 2. A military spouse working on base 3. Over here to teach English 4. A gay man married to a Japanese girl just to divorce her after receiving Japanese citizenship. (No, seriously two that I know of)  As exciting and dramatic as number 4 may sound, I'm a number two with a twist;  A prior enlisted chick/military dependant who landed hard-to-get work off base.  All joking aside, I feel very privileged to work for the largest-profiting telecommunications company in Japan, especially because out of the 5 Americans working for our company, myself and this other guy are the only ones without "dual citizenship" and who are not married to a Japanese National. This position allows me to observe Japan and It's people in a more intimate setting without having to be too attached at the same time.  I don't have to adopt all opinions and beliefs that are in fact  very  Japanese.  My intent of this blog is not to hate on Japan because I really do enjoy living here. I have great respect for Japanese citizens and their traditions.
