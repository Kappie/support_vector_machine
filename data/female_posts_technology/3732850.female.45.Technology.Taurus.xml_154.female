I love how she refers to her garden as a friend. I can relate to this. She talks about how she finds solace in working the soil and how pulling weeds relaxes her. When something is troubling her she goes to her garden to work out her problems.  She talks about her difficulty having children and her disapproval of her brother and sister-in-laws divorce. She talks about how the divorce has affected her nephews from "her perspective." For example,the author feels, "They have been forced prematurely into adulthood and hide the scars of their pain under layers of affected indifference." Is this indeed the case? Are not all 15 year olds indifferent to the world other then themselves? Could it be that because she has not raised children yet herself, that she can not understand this. She also states, "I have learned to force thoughts of the two of them wandering the streets with their other "latch-key" friends from my mind." Are they truly wandering or is she a little jealous because she might think, had these been the children she could not have, she would have done something differently. It is very easy to judge others until we have actually been put in the same situation.   I feel the author raises some very valid points but I am also glad that she realizes that these are not her children to raise and she has done the right thing by, "praying that the seeds of love she has sown will flourish." She can not protect them by building a fence around them as she stated. Her garden, and friend, has helped her to realize this.
