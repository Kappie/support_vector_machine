 An additional perk is that a purchase of $50 or more entitles you to a $0.10 per gallon discount on fuel.  In these times of soaring fuel costs, that makes me more loyal to WinCo than I am to my own family.  
 The problem is, $50 is a little on the high side of what a single person living on their own will likely spend on groceries.  Almost without fail, after I make the rounds through the aisles, I look down at my meagerly filled shopping cart and feel my stomach fill with dread at the thought of a $47.89 grocery bill.  Desperately I think of something, ANYTHING else that I need, or even might want, or even might like to have around just in case.  Pickles?  Sure, I need some of those.  Carton orange juice is pricy, but hey why not.  Soon I'm in Supermarket Sweep mode, careening my overfull cart around the promotional displays frantically grabbing gourmet hams and huge wheels of imported cheese.  
 But the best part is that I know full well that the piddly gas tank in my Corolla holds only 10 gallons of gas, and at $0.10 a gallon...It's like, my brain KNOWS I'm only saving a dollar, but some illogical math-illiterate part of it (I suspect the same part that wants to buy lottery tickets, and coincidentally probably the same part that totally digs Supermarket Sweep) still thinks I'm getting a screaming deal.
