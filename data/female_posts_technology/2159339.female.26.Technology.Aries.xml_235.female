I was supposed to merely  proofread   and  polish   it, but seeing as it lacked a coherent introduction, conclusion, thesis, and most of the other components that tie an academic paper together, I couldn’t help but add those in. He's away on internship training this week and gave me his email password so that I could email the paper to his professor from his account, which I did in the wee hours of the morning. I should have closed the window that moment and left it at that, but instead I took this opportunity to peruse through his inbox...The first few pages were unopened adds for Viagra and hot girl on girl action. I could've stopped there and now dearly wish I would have, but my curiosity got the best of me, so I hit  next   until I found and yes folks, read about 25 emails from two of his ex-ladies. There were emails about school, his job, their travels together, apology letters, love letters, plans for the future, plans for dinner. Though they were from four years ago and earlier, reading each one was like a punch in the stomach. It's obviously my own fault for opening the Pandora’s box, but now I feel shitty and cheap and the words exchanged between them ages ago are going to haunt me for the remainder of our soon-to-be-defunct-anyway relationship. I feel like Hronn Sveinsdottir must have felt in “In the Shoes of the Dragon” when she badmouthed Miss Iceland pageant on the radio and thought she had lost her chances of winning. Great documentary, btw, made by and starring Hronn, who, coincidentally, looks a lot like one of M’s two exes. Fuck you, cosmic forces, fuck you!! (And I'm sorry.)
