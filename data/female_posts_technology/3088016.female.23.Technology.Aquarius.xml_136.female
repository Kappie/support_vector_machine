The updates were quite long and one was rather risque. I would be more than happy to e-mail the entire text at your request, but in the interest of saving time, space and some electrons I'll just post the brief synopsis included at the beginning of each update:    #1  "Anna Finally Goes on a Date"  The short version: Yea!  It was a good date. Not quite sure when it's going, but definitely worth pursuing. In fact, pursuit continued at lunch and will tonight also.....    #2  "Anna Finally Goes on a Date AND is Actually Still Seeing Him a Week Later"  The short version:  I almost ditched him earlier in the week, but I didn't and am now starting to look forward to spending time with him.    #3  "Anna Finally Goes on a Date and Yeah, He's Still Around Here Somewhere"  The short version:  I guess now he should be classified as a boyfriend. Whatever.    I never got around to writing a #4, but in summary I'm kinda sick of thelazy-ass slug boy, but regular sex is nice so I may continue to keep him around.    My future bitching on this site will probably revolve around this relationship, so please make yourself familiar with the situation....    Wahoo!  Anna
