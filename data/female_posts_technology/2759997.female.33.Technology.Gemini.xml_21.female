"Mom") – probably in reaction to one of the following conversations.  2. farting 	 Again Mom – although it wasn’t witnessed by anyone except Mark (thanks for sharing).  3. sex, moving parts (lubricating oil) 	 Who said you can’t learn while you drink?  This is one of the benefits of playing trivia.  The question:  “Lubricating oil is used for:”? Mark’s answer “sex, sex, sex!”  The answer that won points: “moving parts”.  Although that should include sex…  4. coochie  This would be where Peach’s tattoo is NOT  5. clean your box  Brenda’s an anti-germ freak.  Subsequently, we all get our boxes (trivia game playmakers – get your mind out of the gutter) cleaned with an anti-bacterial towelette.  Works great on cell phones too.  6. don't touch my box  And I mean it.  7. "did i hear you say spread"  Funny how a bartender can’t hear a request for a menu, or another drink, or the tab, but from 15 feet away, clearly hears a conversation not intended for his ears…  8. 6, 7, no, 8"  From Mr. Measurementally challenged.  9. Lance Armstrong's crotch  In reference to the “Mr. Texas” tattoo on his arm – which I’ve never noticed, as most media attention is on his crotch.  Although Peach seems fixated by his chest…  10. fuck it, it works  Becoming the motto of the masses.  and last, but not least…  11. "rock on"... the Dude  Seriously, Dude said "rock on" at least 4 times in the 30 second conversation I had with him.  Maybe 6.
