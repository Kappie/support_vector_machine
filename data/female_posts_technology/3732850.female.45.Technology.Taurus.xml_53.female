This is what I am told by my family anyway and it does feel really good to do something I enjoy and this makes me feel wonderful and helps me forget all my worries because I get into making my own homemade crust and peeling the applies and making a little apple out of the crust to put on top when I'm ready to pop them in the oven and the smell is just peachy. The aroma that fills the air just gives the good feeling that I've accomplished something. When they are done, the apple pies disappear in a hurry.  I usually use six to seven red delicious apples in each pie and I always make at least two.  They are also my Dad's favorite.  His Birthday is May 31st and I had made apple pies the day before his birthday.  That morning he had told my mom that he wanted apple pie instead of cake for his birthday.  His wish came true when I came walking in the door with an apple pie in my hand.  I also remember that for thanksgiving, my one brother had to stay home because his kids had the chickenpox so I brought him over apple pie.  I stayed only long enough to tell him Happy Thanksgiving and also long enough for him to tell me thank you and it is the closest to Grandma's pies that will ever be that good.  Now everyone I think expects Apple Pie around the Holidays and my dad on his Birthday.
