I took a shower last night before going to bed after my ahem, ahem, workout(!) and so I was able to get away with getting up late.  Over the weekend I: -Cooked dinner for some friends. They swore it was very good but I didn't make enough for seconds.  -Went back to Main Event for bowling (and some more DDR). We had to pair up because we had 9 people on one line. We didn't think about the number of people when we reserved. -Had coffee at starbucks.  -Watched Paycheck...Uma rocks, Affleck sucks. (Sorry to Affleck fans...if there are any) -Visited with my family -Had Woody and my Mom "gang up" on me about not needing a new computer =b -Scanned my wedding pics (the ones that didn't make it into the wedding album).  I'm not done....its gonna be a looooong and slow process.  Update:  It's getting really cold tonight. I have a thin corduroy jacket and I am certain to freeze my butt off on the walk to my car. This morning's mild weather was so deceitful.  And I just forgot to tune into the weather report, worse luck.    After work, I will be off to do groceries at trusty WalMart. Or should I go to Target?  They have mailed me some saver coupons...hmmmmm....we'll see.  I think I'll grab a McD sandwich. I'm famished and can't wait until after doing the groceries!
