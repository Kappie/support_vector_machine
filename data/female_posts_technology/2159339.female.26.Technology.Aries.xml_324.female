I could always be extra anal and alphabetize books and organize dresses by color like I originally planned, but I don't think that's really necessary anymore. Other than that, didn't do anything productive this weekend, which was the plan. Saw Spiderman, caught a show at Slim's with Batty  Ira, went to BBQs, drove a lot, visited my ex-boss lady, ate noodles with Marcus and peach cobbler with Gwen, read, watched cable, played with my dog.
