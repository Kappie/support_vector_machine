I shopped and ate and visited with family. My face almost got burned from the 4th of July picnic we had. I got very little sleep with all the commotion.  Responding to  urlLink doh's   question, did I get my eat on?  The answer is absolutely YES!  I was craving Jollibee, so for Sunday lunch, right before the 12:30 pm picnic, and while we were supposedly running errands picking up -- what else, more food-- my cousin took my brothers and I to Jollibee and I got my chicken joy on! Our family at the picnic were wondering why we weren't hungry with pansit (noodles), chicken wings, bbq pork, fried rice, dinuguan ( I won't explain this one!), and so many other dishes.  But later on, I did end up nibbling on some of the tasty fare. :)  We also had plenty of Japanese food, with even a Japanese buffet thrown in.  And what did we pack the most of on our trip back?  More food! My mom's pasalubong (gifts for a person) were turon (sweet bananas is the best way I can explain it), sinukmani (sweet) rice), mango cake from Red Ribbon (I bought one for myself and hubby), empanadas, and more jollibee dishes (spaghetti and palabok), and I forgot what else.  Whew, are we a food-loving family or what? Hubby's favorite was the mango cake. It is really very good.  Hubby was the one on my mind the most. I bought mostly things for him when I was there, or else for the house. Here's the stash:   Not bad for less than $100      Japanese tea pot and Japanese bowls, bought from Los Angeles' Mitsuwa      CDs bought from Amoeba Music in L.A.      DVDs and Cologne (CK's Escape)
