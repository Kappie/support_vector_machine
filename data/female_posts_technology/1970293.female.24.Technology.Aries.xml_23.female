My goddess, lend me your power, of beauty and love this midnight hour."  She raised her slender arms towards the stormy skies above, chanting the litany three times three.  Her dark hair blowing like a flag within the wind.  Her heart pounding as her breast rose and fell heavily with each rasping breath.  She was so tired of being alone without someone who loved her and only her.  Who could treat her as a queen but also as a person instead of someone to avoid as a witch.  She wanted to feel like a woman if only once in her lifetime.  She had dreams of loving a man, being with a man almost every night. She hated waking up every morning with tears on her pillow and no phantom lover sleeping beside her.  Maybe she looked to plain to the men and that is the reason none of them ever looked her way.  Not every man could know that she is a witch and avoid her altogether.  That wasn't possible.  There has to be a reason why she was completely and utterly alone when all the other women had someone to love them completely.  It wasn't fair or at least that is how she felt day after day.  She could see the couples walking through the town holding hands, whispering to each other, and kissing one another when they didn't think anyone was watching.  She felt her heart yearn for a moment like that until finally she had to do something about it.    The lightning flashed upon her finely sculptured face, her gleaning green eyes glowing with an inner fire.  She could feel Branwen answering her plea.  She could feel her power coursing through her veins.  She would finally get a chance to live to feel normal.  Yes!  She threw her head back in estasy, her robes billowing behind her, revealing the outline of her slender, curvy body.       All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003
