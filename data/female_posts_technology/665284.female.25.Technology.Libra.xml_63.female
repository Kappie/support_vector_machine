Belgium  will screen on  March 17  at 6:30PM the film  "Toto le héros"  by Jaco van Dormael. The film tells the story of Thomas and Alfred who were born around the same time. A fire in the nursery had the nurses scrambling to save the newborns. Because he felt that he deserved Alfred's good fortune at being born into a wealthy family, Thomas conceives the idea that he and Alfred were switched at birth, and he can't help seeing that his unhappiness should be Alfred's, from the loss of his sister to his inability to have a relationship with Evelyne. So, as his life is ending, he formulates a plan of revenge against his bitter enemy, his lifetime adversary, the man who stole his existence.  On  March 18  at 6:30PM,  Cambodia  will screen  "Raja Bori"  (Royal City). The film is produced and directed by President of the National Assembly of the Kingdom of Cambodia, His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Ranariddh. Prince Ranariddh produced the film to show the public the rich cultural tradition and heritage of Cambodia. These treasures are the greatest accomplishments of King Jayavarman II and King Suryavarman II, who are the most famous in the history of Angkor and the Khmer Empire.   Canada  will present  "Leolo" , a multi-award winning film by Jean Claude Lauzon, on  March 19  at 6:30PM. The film tells the story of Leo who is torn between two worlds - the squalid Montreal tenement that he inhabits with his family, and the imaginative world that he constructs for himself through his writings. His experiences of growing up affect his response to both these worlds.   France  will screen on  March 21  at 6:30PM the film  "Metisse" (Café au lait) . In this comedy directed by Mathieu Kassovitz with Julie Mauduech and Hubert Kounde, a beautiful West Indian mulatta named Lola learns that she is pregnant. The question is, who is the father? There's Felix, a goofy Jewish bicycle messenger and there's handsome Jamal, a law student and wealthy son of an African Ambassador.  On  March 22  at 4:00PM,  Lebanon  will screen the film  "West Beyrouth"  by Ziad Doueiri. It is a moving and uplifting 'rights of passage' tale of three young Lebanese teenagers set against the war torn city of Beirut in 1975.  On the same day,  Switzerland  will screen at 6:30PM  "Les Années Lumière" (Light Years Away)  by Alain Tanner. Set in Ireland, "Les Années Lumière" tells a story about a detached old man who lives in a hangar full of birds. He is now ready to share his secret. In a Dublin bar, he meets a young man who agrees to follow the hard initiatory course until the day when his old master builds himself a pair of wings, flies away and disappears. The young man now inherits the garage, and especially the wisdom of the old man.
