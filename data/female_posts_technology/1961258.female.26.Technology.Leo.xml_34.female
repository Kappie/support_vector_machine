No workouts besides the daily squats and kicks. Yuck, need more cardio.  Weight this morning was 77.7 kg (digital) and 165 - 166 (normal/old scale) .. even got my sis to check that. I have to stop weighing myself every single day, I'll only weigh myself next week. Once a week from now on.   Off to do a little more shopping for the trip, didn't know it was so soon! Have to start packing and I still don't have some of the stuff I need.
