The fishing I have come to enjoy and I can deal with the hunting as long as I don’t have to carry a gun, but the trapping is another story. I can certainly relate with the author of “The Coon Hunt” as she described how she felt when she was expected to kill something for the first time. She stated, “Oh no! I am going to have to kill a raccoon! How am I supposed to tell Dad that I can’t kill anything?” My heart broke for her. Her family was forcing her to except something she did not believe in. I didn’t have to think about hunting, fishing and trapping much until our children started to get old enough to be interested in these activities. I encouraged their love of fishing and when they were old enough, even hunting as long as they hunted with respect for the animals. But somehow, I could never understand why they had to be part of the whole trapping experience. To trap an animal and let it suffer until you return the next day, or even a couple of days later, is deplorable to me. I knew that it was not just my decision, so my husband and I compromised. The kids could accompany him when he was setting traps, but I did not want them to go along when he was actually collecting his catch or skinning or fleshing them in order to be sold. For awhile, this compromise worked nicely until grandpa got involved. One day grandma and grandpa (my husband’s parents), were babysitting our children. When we returned home and pulled into their driveway, I was shocked at what I saw. Grandpa had been out in his “trapping garage” taking care of his catch for the day. He had to skin and flesh the hides of the animals that he had trapped, in order to prepare them to be sold. He decided that our boys could accompany him to watch. I guess one thing led to another and when we pulled in the driveway, they had a beaver’s intestines stretched from one end of the yard to another. Needless to say, I was appalled! Somehow, what they were doing was so disrespectful and disgusting to me. Lives should be cherished even if they are only an animal’s life. When I got out of the car and asked what on earth they were doing? Both of our boys simply replied, “We wanted to see how long they are.” I was speechless. I asked my husband to please get the boys ready to go and I headed into the house to collect their things. Once we returned home, I sat the boys down and explained how I felt about what they were doing and why. They had only been following their grandfather’s lead and were too young to understand that what they were doing was wrong, as far as I was concerned. I explained to them that even though something is dead, we still need to respect their remains. I later discussed my feelings with my father-in-law. He could not understand how I felt, but agreed to make sure that the boys would never partake in something so gruesome again. In exchange, I agreed that when they were older enough, they could make their own decision as to whether they were interested in trapping. I appreciated the respect he showed for my feelings. Interestingly enough, neither one of our boys ever became truly interested in trapping as they grew up. Was it because I felt so strongly about what had happened that day? Was it the compromise my husband and I had reached? Or was it because they too, felt that trapping was an inhumane sport to participate in?
