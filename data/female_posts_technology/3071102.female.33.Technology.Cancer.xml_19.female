Girls, can you imagine dating a philosopher?  A man so caught up in defending different truths and perspectives... that you probably would NEVER really find out what he really and truly thought about something?  (And even if he really and truly believed it... if  someone could convince him otherwise... BING! there he'd go, falling like a tree....) Wouldn't that make a fun blog?
