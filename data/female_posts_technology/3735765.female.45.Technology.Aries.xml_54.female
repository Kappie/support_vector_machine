It just didn't quite seem like a Holiday for me because I have been working overtime since Thursday and will be thru Tuesday.  I missed the fanfares, the celebrations, my family's BBQ, and all the firework displays -- especially the one with the symphony playing in concert along with the extravaganza!  *sigh* Perhaps, next year, I will be able to take advantage of this???  We'll see....  In the meantime, I hope that everyone had a very Happy and Safe 4th of July this year!  Be sure to comment on yours, if you would like.
