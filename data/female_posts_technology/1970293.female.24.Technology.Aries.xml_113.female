Anyways I was told to find you because you would be one of my teachers though I didn't know you was a girl just a little older than I. Why is that?" The boy asked thoughtfully.  "You will be the only student. I am to teach you how to meditate and to control your emotions and actions." Alecka replied quietly as she slowly walked back to the castle.  "Oh. Father did mention something about my err endless supply of energy. I didn't realize he would make me learn to err control it?" He sighed.  "Well we won't start until your other duties start. We will meet for one hour a day right after the last meal. I will tell you now that your rank will mean nothing to me and will mean nothing to the other instructors. I doubt we will have any problems, correct?" Alecka stopped and looked at him assessing his reactions.  "Nah, there won't be any problems. Well maybe with sitting still. I seem to be able to keep moving for hours and hours and it's even hard for me to fall asleep sometimes at night. It always seems like there is something else for me to do or explore." He said with a grin.
