I feel that after being together for ten years we started to take each other for granted. Before the divorce, we tryed counseling and the one thing I found that was actually helping and working was writing down the positive things about each other and we continued doing this for five weeks and then that counselor moved to the cities and our marriage ended shortly after that.  We didn't continue to do what he had planned for us that what actually was working.  Taking each other for granted is very easy to do so I feel it's very worthwhile to put in the time and find out each others interests.  This is not the only thing that went wrong in my marriage.  My ex-husband was never one to communicate.  He was like living with a ghost.  Either that or I just talked too much for the both of us.  Sometimes I would tell him that.  But seriously, there are things I needed to compliment or thank him for and I didn't.  Such as, for example, changing the oil on my car so I wouldn't need to drive sixteen miles to town to have it done or taking the time off work to come to my job and change my flat tire.  I was wearing white jeans that day so I did very much appreciate it but being he was my husband at the time, I just figured this is what he's supposed to do so this is what I mean by taking someone for granted.  This was in our ninth year of marriage.  Of course, this works both ways.  We both worked at Marvin Windows in Warroad, Minnesota for the big window company.  I worked there for four years and to this day he is still there.  In the four years we worked there, I would pack out lunches and help get our two girls to daycare and for me, a thank you would have been nice just as it would have been for him.  I know I packed good lunches because one guy at his table would tell him he would want his lunch box instead of his own. So this is why I feel people take each other for granted and neglect each other without meaning to.  I also feel it has just been crazy with the hustle and bustle of life but what would it hurt to just take these few extra moments after work to talk and just say, "Hey, I really appreciate all you do for me. Thanks for sticking by my side."  One of the other things I noticed is that I would always make chocolate chip cookies and within a week they were gone.  (This part is making me hungry)  He would just ask if I made a new batch of chocolate chip cookies and I'd start in by making more and that one of the things of neglect. No comments on how good they were but where's more instead.  I feel I neglect listening to my daughter without meaning to.  She always catches me when I am busy with the dishes or doing laundry or getting after my three year old and I do try to explain when I tuck her in at night she can tell me then and I'll have her write it down what she wanted to talk about and then I think, Man, what would it hurt to leave the dishes soak and listen to what she has to tell me so sometimes I will do that but once I give her an inch she takes a mile.  She has been helping me so much with my three year old that I have thanked her time and time again and what an angel she has been and then she gets this big smile and just grins from ear to ear.  So one thing people neglect without meaning to is each other sometimes.  This is important to me because my two girls, Bridget and Brittany are my life and also my three year old son, Riley.  It is very hard being a single mom but in the end it is all worth it.
