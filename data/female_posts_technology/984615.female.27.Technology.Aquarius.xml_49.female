But once the drugs wore off, and I sobered up, man. That was not fun.   I'm trying to console myself with the idea that this will bring more symmetry to the aesthetics of my legs. (So what if I can't spell, you get the drift) The last time it was really difficult, simply because I "knew" that I might never speak to my friends again. and in part I was somewhat correct. The friends that I had made such close bonds with and had expected to be there forever were not. I had invested so much into them and had expected so little. But ironically enough it was the people with whom I had not expended nearly the same amount of care and love had really wowed me. They were the ones whom gave back more than I could have ever expected and with whom I am still friends with to this day. I suppose that with hindsight the "friends" (and I use the term as loosely as possible) that I had loved and cared about were really some of the most selfish people I had met. All of the extra energy that I was using up was simply because it was so hard. I thought that all that extra work meant that I was a great friend. Now I can see that it was them and not me, otherwise when I was rehabilitating the first time I would have seen them, would have heard from them.   I suppose that I'm just thinking that I'm lucky that this time around I know that this is not going to cause such rifts. I've already had such a warm outpouring of support and love that I'm feeling okay.   -geeze. One long heck of a way to say that "I'm OK" I'll be okay. I'm a little anxious, but more about the coming home and starting the rehabilitation than anything else. Only because I know that it's going to be painful. But lucky me, I get a hottt guy to "work me good" hahahahah. To bad that it will be about two weeks before I'll probably see him again. He's really nice, but the problem lies in the fact that he's NOT interested and that he's my physical therapist. Although he'd be cool to hang around with. I suppose that I'll have to broach the subject later in the rehab, but he'd be cool....of that I'm pretty sure.  -On another note: i am scared out of my mind that I'll go under and when I get out we'll be in the midst of world war III. I'm not looking forward to it if only that since 9/11/01 there is the knowledge that "we" are vunerable and that we may be a target.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed. You should do the same.
