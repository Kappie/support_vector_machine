Although I hear the crowd was not a large as usual, there where still quite a few people there. I don't even know if you would call it a rally. It all started 15 years ago, I guess, when this guy that owned a farm got together with his friends one July day and decided it was a good idea to jump a bike into his pond. I don’t know what kind of bike it was, but I’m betting it wasn’t a Harley. 15 years later, he still does this, only he gets to sell tickets for it and there’s a lot more people there. There is a tree with all of the past bikes hanging in it. Now that I think about it, I forgot to get a picture of that.    So Friday morning S and I went down to set up camp. At 6 AM. Blah. A couple beers later, camp was set up. I have to say I’ve never had beer that early in the morning. Breakfast of champions. So then we went back home, and I took a nap. After boyfriend got off work, we hopped on the bike and we were on our way. S and J were already there. Friday was kind of tame, though the later it got the drunker everyone got. I started noticing more and more breasts that were not quite staying in their shirts. Girls will do that for those cheap Mardi Gras beads. And after a while, they’ll do it just for the hell of it. Actually, after a while, they'll show just about anything.    Saturday was the jump. Crazy mother fuckers on snowmobiles, 4-wheelers and dirt bikes jumping off a mound of dirt into the nasty muck-filled pond. A ford truck with a winch on it waited nearby to remove them from the pond, with the help of divers attaching the chain. I don’t care who you are, that has to hurt when you hit the water. Especially the guy that rode down with nothing on but his shoes. I didn’t go in the pond, but judging from the looks of him when he got out, the water must’ve been pretty damn cold.    Sometime during the day I got up the nerve to get into a flashing war with J, who was standing across the way from me. Next thing I know, cameras are going off, guys are trying to hand me beads, yelling “do it again, I didn’t get a picture”. OK. ESPN filmed us, SpeedVision filmed us, and dirty old men filmed us. I guess the Speed channel will have a special this fall. I inadvertently flashed the off-duty police officers who were hired for security. They didn’t really seem to mind.    There were other contests besides the jump. The weenie bite, the bike wash, the slow ride, and the wet t-shirt contest. By the time that rolled around, J and I decided we were going to enter. But the closer it got, the more nervous she got, and eventually chickened out. I, however, was brave. Wearing my riding boots and thetiger stripedthong bikini S gave me, I found myself on the stage. Some girls were fully clothed, some were dressed like me, and some seemed to have misplaced all of their clothes. There were no T-Shirts. It was more like a strip tease than a wet t-shirt contest. I think we all had to dance like 2 or three times and then they narrowed down the winners. The prizes consisted of money thrown on the stage by the crowd. There were some girls up there that really shouldn’t have taken their clothes off. But I guess all people like all different shapes and sizes.    I’ll tell ya, that’s a major buzzkill to do something like that for the first time. But judging by the crowd's reaction, I guess I wasn’t all that bad. I didn’t win, but I did make it to the finals. I think 2nd place was a professional stripper. And she paid for her boobs, I was just going with what I was given (which isn’t much). 1st place was a nice girl, and she was stacked better than I, so they liked her more. That’s ok though. I still had fun. And I still have the picture in my mind of boyfriend standing there in the crowd, next to some of his work buddies. They all looked pretty shocked. One thought I was anti-social the first time he met me. I think I was able to rectify that situation.    I got a phone call from NY on Sunday. He called me Miss Superstar. Guess word travels fast around here. He was at a picnic and someone he knew must’ve been at Kamikaze. His girlfriend T lectured me. But she thought boyfriend would be mad. I think he liked it. Actually I know he did.    And he says I’m entering it again next year.
