The situation would've been much better than now. i agree. but who knew she was gonna get hired. They will try to find her another location. Worse case, i gotta suck it up and watch my ass. This is all in the past now in THREE..................TWO.....................ONE.  okay, new topic.  anyhoo, i didn't turn on the A.C. today. kind a hot. i'm really feeling like taking my top off. getting sweaty here. i'll turn on the fan.
