I sit awake There's an angel Contemplate my fate  And do we know The places where we go When we're gray and old'  Cause I have been told That salvation lets their wings unfold  So when I'm lying in my bed thoughts running through my head and I feel that love is dead I'm loving angels instead  And through it all She offers me protection A lot of love and affection Whether I'm right or wrong  And down the waterfall Wherever it may take me I know that life won't break me When I come to call She won't forsake me I'm loving angels instead  When I'm feeling weak And my pain walks down A one way streetI look about And I know I'll always be blessed with luck  And as the feeling grows She breathes flesh to my bones And when love is deadI'm loving angels instead  And through it all She offers me protection A lot of love and affection Whether I'm right or wrong  And down the waterfall Wherever it may take me I know that life won't break me When I come to call She won't forsake me I'm loving angels instead  And through it all She offers me protection A lot of love and affection Whether I'm right or wrong  And down the waterfall Wherever it may take me I know that life won't break me When I come to call She won't forsake me I'm loving angels instead!
