I didn't want to get upset when I hoped you were calling to ask me to coffee after the teachers' meeting and it would turn out to be some inane question about the school or to ask me what I thought of today's class.  What do you care what I thought of today's class. If you valued my thoughts you would still be my friend.   You know what? I have spent a lot of time lying on my face these past two days, because of a back injury. And it occurred to me in that time, that all you ever needed to do was say six words to me that would have lessened my suffering. "Pam, I'm sorry I hurt you."  But you never did. You never even acknowledged the possibility that you may have hurt me.   And then it occurred to me that you might not even realize that you broke my heart. You will not even allow me ten minutes to talk.  But you continue to send German lessons for free. And you called me twice on Saturday. Why? Do you enjoy repeatedly stabbing me? Either be my friend or leave me alone.   I intend to put a stop to the German lessons. You  will not accept my money and you don't want my friendship, and the last thing I want is to be in debt to a former friend.  I'd rather just pay someone.  Besides, I don't want you to teach me German unless we are also friends. And we are not.  Or rather you are not.  If you have any original thoughts left, Thomas, if you are still even remotely capable of thinking for yourself, please look beyond your own nose for a moment and see that you hurt me.  See that you sent me over 5000 e-mails in the past two years, telling me how much I meant to you, gaining my trust, gaining my husband's trust, and that we both believed you were a true friend to me.  And then you suddenly dropped me without so much as a word of explanation or warning, and then, as if that wasn't painful enough, had to drive the knife in me one more time by telling me it wasn't personal.  Oh, so it was a business decision. You dismissed me like a servant. That's comforting.  Thomas, for God's sake, open your eyes. You broke my heart. You earned my trust and then you abused it. You are capable of doing such things. Other people besides you can have feelings.  I remember how you said, talking about a girlfriend you had, whom you really loved, who left you without explanation or warning, leaving you devastated for years, "No one could know my pain."  Well, Thomas, you're wrong. Someone can.
