This is a big accomplishment for me. Rarely do I refuse a deepfried potato!   As well I went to the gym today. I didn't get by weights done but I did run for 30 minutes. After 20 minutes I was about to give up (I just get so bored!) when I thought of the three of you and had to keep going. I even sprinted for a full minute at the end! So there you go. If it wasn't for you guys, I would of stopped at 20 minutes. Thank you.   Heather you seem to be doing really well on your diet. How about substituing the apple for strawberry's or raspberry's?   Ok I'm off to bed. Lates
