In my research, I found  urlLink this  aggregator, which rocks.  Then I started finding all these blogs out there with RSS feeds and figured I could do that.  The ironic part is that my blog's feed isn't RSS; it's Atom...  Which means I can't access it in my favorite aggregator.  Anyway, that was my version of a "catch you up to where I am now" introduction...  Here's an interesting  urlLink article  by Nick Bradbury on client side aggrators and their impact on bandwidth and how his aggregator was designed to minimize bandwidth consumption.
