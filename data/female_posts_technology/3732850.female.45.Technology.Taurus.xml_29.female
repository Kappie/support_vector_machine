There is the wonderful sound of water that that I have always found to be so soothing and comforting. Every year we go camping to the Big Fork River campground. It’s a beautiful place just off the highway but you would never know it once you turn off the road and enter the campground. There are enormous rocks that line the river banks towering over the wild water that rushes by. There are campsites right on the river bank and I always hope that the one located on the “point” is available when we get there. You can not make reservations at this camp site so you never know what might be available. This spot is unbelievably beautiful. From the tall pine trees that stand in contrast to the bright blue sky, to the wild golden brown water that is constantly rushing by, it is all such a splendid site. Of course when we go there, we always know that Grandpa will be there guiding us as we park, as we unpack the campers, as we get everything organized.   He often times, would leave hours ahead of us, just so we could get the spot that we all loved so much. He would save it for us by parking there, knowing how much we loved it. It didn’t matter to Grandpa that he didn’t get the favorite spot. It was more important to him to save it for us. Once we got everything setup, and Grandpa was satisfied that everything was okay, we would go exploring. We would walk along the rocky banks of the river looking for any treasures that might have washed up. His main purpose for this walk was to find the best fishing hole so that we might have fish for supper. He knew we loved that too. Grandpa would make sure that he had the perfect marshmallow sticks cut for the after supper campfire that we all enjoyed so much. While we sat around the campfire, there was the whittling that needed to be done. The kids loved to try and guess just what Grandpa was going to create out of some little stick or log, and also, who would be the lucky recipient of the finished product. Somehow Grandpa always made sure that everyone had something he had whittled before the camping trip was over.   Morning was a time that could be a little frustrating with Grandpa. He would be up at the crack of dawn chopping wood to get the campfire going again. I would lay there and listen to him making sure that the fire was just right, and then we would hear the dreaded, bang, bang, bang on the camper door. “Time to get up, the day’s a wasting.” The kids would crawl out of their sleeping bags all sleepy eyed and head out the door to sit by the fire with Grandpa. He always made sure that there was a dry place to sit. They would talk about their plans for the day and of course pretend to criticize “Granny” and me for not hopping up right away to get breakfast going. Grandpa would say, “Time to get moving, the day is a wasting.” To Grandpa, camping on the Big Fork River was all about the adventures and the experiences he shared with all of us.  About a year and half ago, Grandpa passed away. We have not returned to the Big Fork River. Somehow it could never be the same without Grandpa there. We have talked as a family that we must return and carry on even though Grandpa is not there because, remember, “Time to get moving, the day is a wasting.”
