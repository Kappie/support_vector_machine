All exercises at 3 sets of 10 reps:    Military Press  50 lbs   Shoulder Fly  8 lbs  Barbell Front row 45 lbs  Squat  70 lbs  Stiff Legged Deadlift  80 lbs  Calf Raise  45 lbs  I'm working my butt off so I'll spare you too much verbiage. I did notice that I have a fondness for cute, fuzzy, and sociopathic animals when it comes to comic strips.  urlLink Sluggy Freelance  has the malevolent Bun-Bun, the miniature lop-eared rabbit. Here is one famous  urlLink exploit , but for sheer brutality this is my  urlLink favorite .  While he's nowhere near as Evil (with a capital E), I am also very fond of Bucky Katt from  urlLink  Get Fuzzy . He has his own  urlLink style .
