For some reason there seems to be a derth of girls in Seattle.  And forget it if you're looking for single girls.  We were trying to think of single girls for this guy that was with us and we came up with a whopping zero people.  It appears to me that lite beer is making a huge comeback.  Almost everyone was drinking it last night and it's been happening more and more.  Maybe it's because the summer is coming and people want to trim down.  Red Orange Yellow Green Sometimes people are really mean.  I couple of people have snapped at me lately.  Maybe I'm sending off some agressive vibe or something.  One of the times I think I asked one too many questions.  The other time, I refused to change my mind or be quiet.    Peeps season is in full swing.  I'm going to an egg hunt on Saturday.
