It's an Ann Landers article, where a teacher in Mississppi needs help in explaining the difference to communism, fascism, and socialism. Ann gives us an interesting look at political science.    Socialism:  You have two cows. Give one cow to your neighbor.    Communism:  You have two cows. Give both cows to the government, and they may give you some of the milk.    Fascism:  You have two cows. You give all the milk to the government, and the government sells it.    Nazism:  You have two cows. The government shoots you and takes both cows.    Anarchism:  You have two cows. Keep both of the cows, shoot the government agent and steal another cow.    Capitalism:  You have two cows. Sell one cow and buy a bull.    Surrealism:  You have two giraffes. The government makes you take harmonica lessons.
