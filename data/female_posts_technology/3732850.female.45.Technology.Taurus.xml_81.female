I want them to thrive.” I think we all want that for our children and for other children as well. I agree with Deb Sullivan essay In the Garden we want to help those children that would like to have someone to believe in them and listen to what they have to say. I want to protect my children from the harshness that they will have to deal with when they get older and meet my ex-husband which is their dad. He has so much hate for me that he can’t see how bad he’s harming the children when he refuses to see them. He believes that the children will be happy to see him with open arms.  After my parents divorce my father also thought that when my brother and I got older we would welcome him open arms. However, I haven’t seen or talked to my dad in three years. I want to give my children the security they need to have a healthy relationship with their partner and their children one day.  There are my children’s friends that have their father’s in their lives and the kid’s are lonely even though their father’s are there. I get a lot of my children’s friends over and the first thing they say to my husband and I is why can’t my parents be just like you guys. These parents sometime forget how they too were once kids and sometimes we get to busy being adults and not thinking about our children, so that they can feel safe and thrive. In a sense we do build that fence, but not the way the children want us to just want us to listen.  We all can build a fence around anything but we need compassion behind it and we need to let them breath fresh air, if not when they break down that fence look out. My niece’s parents have build fences so high for her that it turned out to be more harmful, she can’t wait until she’s 18 years old and she has told her parents that she is moving out because they have build fences to protect her and they were too high. My niece can’t do the same things as most kids. She’s 15 years old and she can not take a walk around her block because her parents think that someone might kidnap her, however my son who is 13 years old walk home from the middle school dance and home is by the mall. She is also not allowed to walk to the skating rink from my house.  I have a teenager that we had in our home for the past 3 months that had to adjust being in our home that has structure. Before, his mom really didn’t care where he was just as long as he was home at night. He chose to live with us because we have showed our kids we care. The relative he was staying with drank a lot, and he didn’t like that live style there. I hope that we have given him something to carry out in his life when he leaves next Monday, hopefully he will thrive in life and know that someone does care.
