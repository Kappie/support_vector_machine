I'm wondering if I should be scared for today.  Positive encounter #1: Ran in to the ex outside the building at work on my morning break. Considering I'm not a happy camper before about 11am, I was prepared for some type of run-in with him. He had this look on his face that is screaming "I'm beyond pissed, so really don't feel like fucking with you right now". So I am surprised as hell when he walks right up to me and gives me a hug. And not just a "hey how ya doing, how ya been" hug. Oh no, this is a "I need something cause life is shit right now" hug. Now mind you, we are standing smack in the middle of the doorway to get into the building. I'm thinking to myself  "Why are you doing this right here, right now, can we please move!"  But, I don't say anything. Turns out he was just having a crappy day with office politics (this place isn't all people think it is) and just needed consolation. How   I   became this source of support, I don't really know, but I listened anyway, cause I'm not  that  mean (well not always anyway). Now considering all of this happened from someone how a week ago, probably was considering putting a hit out on me so he could take our son back...this this was a major turning point. I get back to my desk and surprise number 2 - he has instant messaged me telling me that despite what I've done, he can't help but to forgive me because of his love for me. I'm reading this thinking "OMG...there is a God" How much more thankful can I be to know that our dispute over the boy is finally over...3 weeks earlier than I anticipated. Ahh, can the day get any better?  Positive encounter #2: A girlfriend of mine invited me to go a lil social networking event with her on Friday. Normally, thats no big deal..I'm usually invited to stuff. But  this  friend isn't just any friend. I only recently gained back the ability to call her  anything at all  much less my friend. This is a friend that I broke "girl's rule number 1" with. Yeah, I did it. I got involed with her "ex" (who I later found out wasn't exactly her ex after all). At the time it happened, I was going through my separation from the "ex" and I used the excuse that she had not always been such a good friend to me, and we weren't on "that" level of friendship, so her man was not off limits to me. None of those we're good excuses, then or now. What's worse is that, once it came to light, I felt terrible about it. I don't usually do things I regret...if I did it, I meant it. Even getting married...I don't and will never regret. But this, doing what I did to her...I will always regret. I realized how much of a friend she actually was to me when I destroyed our relationship. Now, 2 years later, upon my moving back to Atl, we were able to sit down one night at dinner just just let everything out. The hows, the whys, and most importantly, the "I'm sorrys". What is forgiveness? When a woman can forgive another woman for doing the unspeakable. It meant more to me than I can explain for her to not only accpet my apology but to forgive me as well. So for us to kick it,  and her to have actually invited me ...a sista is still on a high!  Positive encounter #3: There is so much more to sexy than the physical. Intelligence, aspiration, motivation...that's sexy to me. And so is originality. The worst thing about dating is the constant "getting to know you" questions. I just like to spend time just talking and getting a feel for a person, not spending 2 hours anwering question after question. Anyway, the current guy I've been getting to know (we'll call him SC), for about a month or so now, asked me one of the most original questions I've been asked in quite a while. My answer to "how was you day?" is usually "pretty good, could been better, could been worse". Mostly because I don't like to dwell on the negative...I just push it aside and keep on going. SC asked me in response to my answer, "what could've been better about it?" LOL, can we say I was  totally  taken aback by that! I've never had anyone actually show an interest in what happened during my day and what was bad about it. So I was more than shocked, most pleasantly I must say. I shared with him the little things that were bad about the day, and we continued our convo from there. Talking to him is always refreshing. We always have "interesting, out of the norm" conversations. And I have yet to like he's coming at me just for the physical. Its going to be interesting to see how this one plays out...most guys don't make it past 2 weeks...he's been around and  still  holding my interest for over a month now.
