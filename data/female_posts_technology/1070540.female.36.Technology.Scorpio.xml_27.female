But last night again, he got up set with me and didnt come to bed until morning.  He accused me of not wanting to blow him any more.  That is so far from the truth. He doesnt know that in our fight the other night a tooth got broke.  IT HURTS...and that in the inside of my mouth I had a HUGE swollen layer on the inside of my lip with a cut on it.  It hurt to eat more less blow.  But I didnt want to tell him cause I did not want to hurt him,  But come to find out.  It hurt him cause I didnt blow him.  I do love him with all my heart and I didnt know if it would hurt him if he knew I really got hurt the other night.  One more bruise left and It will all be over with.  THANK GOD!!   I love my husband with all my heart and I will never do anything like that again.
