Someone asked me on account of Zam-Zam well. How could I forget to write on it, after bagging 20 litre of the 'lemak' water. The account should continue from an earlier part of my write-up in the Safa Hill and Marwah Hill  urlLink    (the 2 ultimate points in Sa'i). As Siti Hajar, ran from hill to hill (400m apart), in search of passers-by with water or food, Prophet Ismail (as), then a baby, tapped his feet on the earth. That point where he tapped, came out the now-still-exist Zam-Zam.  Sad to say, the Zam-Zam well is closed from visitors, due to misusages. But we should feel fortunate to be able to savour the water all around. The Zam-Zam dispensers are very within reach in every corner of Masjidil Haram, and even Nabawi.  A SHOUT-OUT for passers-by, do you folks know the exact height of Jabal Nur  urlLink   . I thought I heard it correctly 2500m. But that's impossibly too high (me so terror is it?). Or perhaps 2500 feet, that converts to less than 1km. My web-search results threw me few answers like 621m, 500 feet etc. Nice souls, kindly tag me for some possible or definite measurements.  Another kind of missing of being in land of Arabia, is its TV channel, MBC. Apart from offering quite backdated seasons of US serials like X-Files, Lois  Clark; it has spread of uber good local delicacies (read: for sightings, not eating).  Arabs have their own rendition of Fear Factor  urlLink   , with a male and female compere. They have their own house comedians  urlLink   , CBM, which are so Senario-alike. My favorite, which I always caught few glimpses before heading 2 masjid for subuh, is Fantasia. Each episode sees one good, popular Arab singers accompanied with 'Live' band. One segment in it is the hypnotise-session. I am thinking of checking out one songstress, Fatin Brazi. Their music videos, POWER.   You folks must be wondering, where on earth I dig time to watch TV. Well, in between packing our stuffs, or ironing our garments.  urlLink     I can't wait to upload the pictures here, as requested by many too. I could only collect the negatives-burnt-to-CD next Monday. Well, unless Liza is so hardworking to scan pic by pic. No!  On the meanwhile, waiting for dear hubby to fetch me. What should I cook? What should we eat? Have to something fast to cook. But not instant noodles, ok!
