As a young girl, my mother would come into my bedroom, vacuuming imaginary dust bunnies, in an effort to get me out of bed on Saturday mornings. I hated that disrespect, and therefore do not do that to my kids. As a teen  young adult, I was late every day for my 7 a.m. job and damn proud of it. And to this day, I am at least 5 minutes late to work on my 8 o'clock days .... sometimes more. I never have had the urge to pop out of bed 2 hrs. before I have to be somewhere, putter around  drink coffee. My grandfather did that. He would get up at 4:00 a.m. every day to putter around. I'm glad that floats his boat, but honey, it doesn't make my butter-fly. When I retire, I will listen to my body's inner rhythms and sleep when I want to, and stay up half the night. Meanwhile I silently curse the corporate idiots who deem 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. to be the hours of productivity. Sons of bitches. Who died and made you the official time keepers?  Angelina Jolie just got a 12 inch tattoo of a tiger on her back. I read in a book that she gets (ahem)  sexual pleasure  from getting a tattoo. Would love to be a fly on the wall of that tattoo parlor. Damn!
