The 1 yen coins feel like play money and weigh nothing. The paper currency is of varying lengths and is quite colorful. I believe this phenomenon carries over to American men and Japanese women.    As a young Marine I couldn't understand why an American would go to any foreign country, especially an Asian country because of the seriousinitial language gapand marry someone they hardly knew and could barely communicate with. I assumed weak American pansies liked the idea of an Asian woman - quiet and meek in public but pushy and loud behind closed doors. Now that I have met Asian women of Japanese, Korean, Philippine and Thai descent I find that stereotype to be largely untrue. Instead, 99% of the American men I know and/or work for are complete jerks.    These men are dominant, not submissive. They talk to their wives like they are idiots. At work they brag about how they put their bitches (my word) in place. They are insidious womanizers and from the way they talk and act they would probably cheat on their wives at the drop of a hat. Japanese women are like drugs to these men. They flirt with any woman who is remotely cute and don't even realize how desperate they look. These men are fooled by these women's compliments and small talk but as soon as the foreigners leave the room these same girls stare at each other and say, "He knows something about everything, doesn't he?" These are the same men who probably never even got laid until they came to Japan because of attitudes and/or appearances. All of a sudden they come here and turn into celebrities of a sort. They are gaijin. And we wonder why Western-looking men are always casted as the goofy, loud, supa-genki characters on Japanese television.    No, I'm not hatin'. I feel sorry for these women.One time I heard an American man state, "Ipersonally don't see why Japanese women like Japanese men to begin with!"True.Japanese men should be sent to a remote island in their middle age. When they reach their 40's they become very annoying and set in traditional ways which don't allow for rational thinking most of the time. On the other hand there has to be something out there that is better than horny, drooling and obnoxiousWestern foreigners.    There 4 American/Japanese marriages on my side of the building and two on the other side. I don't know how girls' husbands of the other side very well but out of the marriages on our side, only one seems healthy and happy. She is Japanese and works across from me and her husband is retired Air Force. She is a strong smart woman and I think she picked a good one. The rest of the employees are American men. Regardless of how these menbehave themselves I wish their marriages the best.
