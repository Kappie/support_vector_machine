Though circumstances have led the band to part ways with singer Geert van der Velde, and change the name to The Warmth Of Red Blood, assuredly the new music and lyrics are a continuation and progression that still finds Shai Hulud's message, style, and sound intact. Fox and Fletcher are looking for a full-time vocalist for The Warmth Of Red Blood. Head to the band's website for details on the type of singer that they're looking for and to download an instrumental version of the song "Whether To Cry Or Destroy" from Shai Hulud's That Within Blood Ill-Tempered. Applicants can use it to demo their vocals when applying.
