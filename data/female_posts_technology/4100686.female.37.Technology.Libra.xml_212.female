She also knows a Kabul woman who travelled to Laghman province and in two days obtained 40 cards by wearing a burqa and opting to provide her thumbprint rather than a photo.   A woman in Kabul is going to vote 40 times? I am kind of speechless, an unusual situation for a weblogger i know. There must be some kind of witty joke to tell. When do voter registrations in Iraq begin?  Cheers  urlLink corey.
