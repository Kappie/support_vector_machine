Swimming for about 45 minutes, twice - three times a week (so far) and feeling a nice burn. I haven't drawn up a fixed program just yet but I've been consistent. Did some sprints today. I haven't hit my 10,000 steps per day .. more like 6,000 to 8,000 instead. Some days more .. when I go shopping so I think each week I definitely hit 70,000 steps .      Eating has been okay as well. Just yesterday my mom handed me some Xenical. I was asking her to try those instead of all those other shady things .. and in the end she got them, handed them to me and said that'll be $130! I'm like whoa .. they cost that much for 2 strips? I only take them if I have a binge-fest of fat .. which isn't often. Like .. say, this evening I had some McD's .. so took one. None of the dreaded side effects yet though .. so we'll see in 48 hours after this meal. It's not a miracle pill but if you're eating high fat food constantly .. like for breakfast, lunch, dinner plus snacks .. then you pop this pill and it cuts 30% of the fat .. so I understand why it would work for a really overweight person. I'm not sure whether it'll work for me but at least I have a .. panic button .. so to speak, when I eat something horrible like pizza or fast food. Cutting back on the 'junk' food but still not 0% which I think is what I need to hit .. even if I have a bite of something 'bad' the day is a bad day .. not healthy, huh?     My weight is still ugh .. 77 kg .. 168 - 170 lbs. Feel constantly .. bloated. Ugh. Too much info ... :)  But I kinda like how I look .. don't know why. I know I'm heavier than I was before and I probably look real tubby and have a chubby face or whatever .. but I like how I look. I even like how I look in my swimsuit! So I don't know .. my eyes are tricking me or some such thing.
