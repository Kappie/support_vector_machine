I work in a nursing home and can relate to the things that this lady is experiencing. I often wonder what these people did or enjoyed when they were younger. Many times while working though, we as aides unfortunately don’t have the time to stop and ask or listen as we would like. I find it refreshing to have a day when we are not short of help on the floor and can spend the time that is deserved these people under our care.
