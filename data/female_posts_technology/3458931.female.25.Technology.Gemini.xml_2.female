Maybe I'm accepting this, maybe I'm at another stage of my grieving. It's still hard to eat, I've lost something like three pounds this week.  Cosmopolitan says that if a guy isn't ready to make a commitment after being in a relationship for several years he really isn't in love. I guess that's food for thought.   The female mind is a scary thing. Mine makes up all kinds of weird scenarios. I think things like "what if he was lying and he did dump me for another chick", even though I know that's really unlikely. I get angry too, I think things like "he's a selfish coward"; but two seconds later I'm wondering what I might have done to drive him away.
