I decided to concentrate on my living room so thursday I went to Menards in Grand Forks to price out everything I need. I was having fun. It's going to cost me about two hundred dollars to get my living room done. The walls I am going to do in dover white. I'm going to get blinds that are an ivory color and these neat looking rods to have a tan sway above the blinds. I'm going with a shade darker for the trim and when I finish this class this is what I hope to work on during my two weeks off before school starts up again. I'm excited because my walls are blue and one is brown. I was experimenting. I can't wait to see the change. I have a light green on my trim and this is a hideous combination. I am going to take before and after pictures and I can't wait. I also need to get the ceiling painted. When I was at school, the girls busted the blind on the one window by playing ball in the house.  Anyway, I can't wait until I get it done.
