For those of you that went straight...or, ehm, forward, to this posting, I am a Lesbian Geekoid that tends to be a bit forward, a bit crazy, and a bit brilliant.  However, I do have my boring moments, so no worries, my life seems to be a magnet for drama, it'll get interesting again soon.  Because of that "drama" element, there may be a few pauses in my posting, but I will be faithful in my checking the email and the site.    Recent happenings is my partner, Renee, and myself bought our first house...Woo Hoo!  And we have been learning about the joys and fustrations of owning a house.  There are so many things needed!  A latter, hose, lawn mower...weed eater....and the list goes on. We tried to develop a list of projects that we wanted to do when we moved in and found that all the money has gone into getting tools and stuff to do the stuff we wanted to do when we moved in.  Gah.    So, this is not much of a beginning, but instead of overwhelming the masses with one long post, I'll try to break things up into chapters so y'all that don't care about what's going on at my work can just read what's going on at home.  Feedback is always welcome but flames will be ignored.    Enjoy...I'm looking forward to hearing from you guys.
