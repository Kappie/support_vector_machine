It's just polite.  If there is one or more woman in the group and you're out at night or at some event that's not super-casual, ask before taking a long walk.  This has happened to me a few times, and I'm sure it's not because the guys in the group are mean.  I think they truly don't get it.  I've been told to "toughen up" and "it's not much longer."  Well F*CK YOU!  If someone was in pain, I would recommend sympathy and/or encouragement.  Or FIND A CAB!  So as I woke up this morning and felt the pain of my feet before touching them down to the carpet, I was angry.  I had been waved off when I asked for a cab.  I was told it's ridiculous - it's only 4 more blocks.  I'm not kidding, it was like 14 more blocks from that point.  My shoes are actually very comfortable for going out.  They're just not made for long walks.  I had the appropriate band-aids on my pinky toes for an evening out.  I don't want to have to wear tennis shoes when I go out, and I don't want to change my friends.  I don't like to be the demanding, needy girl in a whole group of comfy-shoe claden guys.  Next time I hope whoever I'm with will be more sensitive, more aware, and polite.  In reality, I will probably have to shout a little louder.
