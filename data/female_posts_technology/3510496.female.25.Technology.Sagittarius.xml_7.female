Quite a no of people saw us off, esp. hubby's side that left me all red-eyed n puffy-cheeked.   In my virgin, long flight, I sat in between my hubby n our tour group official, Ms Norsiah. It's a sheer pleasure sitting with her, because I know a great deal from her experience. Now I know, most officials for umrah/hajj are volunteers who took leave from their daily job on their own accord. Women are granted such visa twice a year only, compare to unlimited for men.   @ 5pm (SA time, SG time is 10pm), we reached King Abdul Aziz International Airport in Jeddah. To clear customs, it took almost 2 hours, although it wasn't that crowded. Truly reminds me of our neighboring country.  Once cleared, boarded the bus heading to Medina. Half way, stopped somewhere for late dinner.     June 4th 2004 Friday   We checked into Al-Fayroz Hotel in Medina at 2am (SA time). 3.30 am was time for Subuh prayer, and Masya Allah, Masjidil Nabawi is just a walking distance from our hotel (e.g. Scotts cross-over Shaw Isetan).  The view of Nabawi @ early pre-dawn is so exhilarating. I was kind of 'jakun'. At the entry of the female prayer hall, there were policewomen all black, with number-tagged, and you could only peek at their alluring eyes. And gosh! I forgot to leave my camera, despite constant reminding from mama. The policewoman pointed turn back at me to leave my camera in Arabic (of course). And me talked 'duck' and don’t know what's on top of my head, passed the camera to her and ask her to keep for me till after prayers.   Laa' … Laa' … Haram Siti Rahmah  (No … No … It's unlawful Siti Rahmah).  I wonder since when I changed my name to Siti Rahmah. Well, they practically call you either Hajjah or Siti Rahmah.   Left with no choice, I turned back to my hotel, hearing the first adzan. I returned back of cause camera-free. The same policewoman spoofed some Arabic again, and me simply nodding my head, and she hugged me.  I got more 'jakun' entering the prayer hall in Nabawi. I looked up and got awed with the lightings, scriptures. I looked down as my 2 tired feet threaded down the cool, marble flooring. I looked around, n saw neatly rowed Zam-Zam dispenser to quench congregates' thirst, and the beautiful women with beautiful children.   Most of these women covered themselves from head to toe, some even runs a net over their eyes. But do you know underneath the dull, black outfit (abayat), they wore fancy, colourful ones. Well, if you are a true observer, there are numerous ways of presenting women's headgear. There are simply-slip-in ones, even velcro-ed ones!  Breakfast came right after Subuh. After that, we rested a little while because we were to get ready to visit Taman Raudhah, where our Prophet Muhammad pbuh and his 2 friends, Saiyidina Abu Bakar  Saiyidina Umar been laid to rest forever.   Making our way through there was truly challenging plus my little sister hesitation. My mother chose to be left out, because her feet were giving her away, which resulted her to be wheel-chaired most of the time after that.  But with perseverance and highest desire, I brought myself and sis to push our way through. Seriously, we are minute compare to those big-boned and structured women surrounding us. We could only stood hard-stoned despite vigorous nudging from them. Alhamdulillah, we managed to stood by all 3 makams, read du’a and sent salam from others.  That was not the last bit of it. We joined mama, and the rest of the ladies, slightly further from the Raudhah area. One middle-aged lady, Ms Aishah, who was on wheelchair too, suddenly asked whether I could bring her there. I do not have the heart to reject her, but since she has faith in me, I simply lend her to hold on to my shoulder, sans her wheelchair.  It was a more challenging trip compare to earlier. I really admire this Ms Aishah. She wanted to go all the way front. I was worried of her condition, but I simply obliged and hold her tighter to me. At the end of it, we had one very happy, contented and thankful Ms Aishah who kept singing my praises to the ladies around, that encouraged a mother, Ms Hanim and her 14 yr old midget daughter Filza to take me as their chaperon into Raudhah again.  In my heart, Dear Almighty, is this one of the bout of challenges You pose to me? In that case, I shall take it. And for the 3rd time, on the very same Friday, I made my way to Raudhah.  We are fortunate to get our first Friday prayer in Nabawi, and later another Friday prayer in Masjidil Haram (this one later can talk).  After Asar, hubby and I were left some time to tour around nearby. And this time round, camera not to be forgotten. Part of Medina especially around our lodging, is truly Manhattan-like. Who says, its all deserts and camels?  If we have KFC, they have Al-Baik (frankly, stick on to our KFC). If we have BK, they have Hardees. Don't be cheated, their claimed beef-burgers are all actually mutton. Hubby took a pose with the friendly Hardees’ crew counters (who thought we are Malaysians). And we won a digital language translator in instant lucky dip!  We bought an electrical scent burner from this shop owned by a Pakistani, and assisted by a Gurkha. Basically, all sellers around are so eloquent in Malay or Bahasa. To think my hubby went through all the pain drilled by me of numbers in Arabic.   Yahhh Haji/Hajjah …. Ini murah-murah. Satu sepuluh riyal..   Knocks forehead.     June 5th 2004 Saturday   After breakfast, it's Medina City Tour.   First Stop, Makam Al-Baqi, where those who demised being buried.  In Singapore, women are free to step in cemeteries, but not in Holy City. It's all gated, for women to simply stand outside and read their prayers.  Second Stop, Jabal (Bukit) Dzur. Simply visiting, no hiking. Too bad we are only given only 20 minutes, because there seems to better bargains at the foot of hill from the street-sellers around.  Third Stop, Kebun Kurma. Dates tree actually looks like Kelapa Sawit tree. My father said, there's a connection, but he couldn't recall the story told by the ustaz on his last haj trip. Very interesting.  Fourth Stop, Masjid Kubah, first mosque build by Prophet Muhammad pbuh. Every corner we went, there seems to street peddlers around. I bought 2 neat, thermos flasks for me n MIL.  Fifth Stop, Masjid Kiblataini (2 kiblat). This was true challenge for mama, because it's not wheelchair-friendly. We had to assist her to endure 4-storeys high, before reaching the female musollah.  Sixth Stop, Masjid Tujuh (sad to say only left 3 or 4, due to commercialization). How come the Saudis doesn't fight to preserve it at least?  Seventh and Final Stop for the day, Pasar Kurma. We bargained with Pakistanis again, for 2kg of Ajwa (kurma nabi), 2kg of pistachios and 3 boxes of small-packed Kurma badam. Happy with our loot, head back to hotel, in time for Zuhur.  After Asar, hubby and I were in hunt of local cuisine, like their dhal/keema dip. This was due to my previous day greed buying lots of their beautiful, fresh looking breads, which was not so good to eat own its own. After grabbing a Moroccan jubah for hubby, both of us wondered aimlessly for eateries. It seems only kebab for food here and there. We even went far until passed by Makam Al-Baqi, till we ended up in some backlands, and construction area with only men around. Scary.  With God's willing, suddenly we found a long stretch array of eateries. Which was only a distance away from Nabawi. The dalcha and sambar chicken till now still lingering in my tastebud.  After Isyak, hubby and I went back to the same shop we bought the scent burner to get more of Kasturi Putih scent. Luggage-packing time back in hotel, since luggages have to be outside our room by 10am tomorrow. Heading to Mecca the next day.    June 6th 2004 Sunday   Ziarah Wada (Farewell Visit) to Taman Raudhah. This time round, Mama's feet are better, so we managed to charged through right at its opening hour (for females) at 6.15am. You should take note the sounds of scurrying, stomping footstep of the ladies. It sounds almost like horses galloping.  I was so emotional to leave Medina, which really offers lots of tranquility in my mind. My husband even expresses his thoughts he wouldn't mind settling there even to sell goreng pisang. You have no excuse not to catch all your 5-times prayers in Nabawi, which something we really look forward. Time is really short there, yet so worthy.  Before Asar, all of us in ihram, head to Nabawi for last time to perform our Asar and Ihram Prayers. Farewell Medina, Insya Allah, I will come by again in future.  We stopped by at Jabal Uhud, where Sayidina Hamzah (Prophet Muhammad's uncle perished in the Uhud War). He was laid rest nearby too. After reading prose of Al-Fateha to him, hubby and I decide to hike a bit of the Jabal Uhud. On the way, we met my hubby's step-granny, Nek Lamah, who was busy bargaining for prayer mats.  Last stop in Medina was Masjid Bir Ali (first miqat – jatuhkan niat umrah). After that, we are encouraged to chant the talbiah.   Labbaikallah Humma Labbaik. Labbaikala Syarikala Laka Labbaik. Innal Hamda. Walniqmata. Lakawalmulk, Lasyarikalah.     June 7th 2004 Monday   By the time we reached Masjidil Haram, it was half past 1 am. And goodness gracious, if I thought earlier our lodging in Medina is very near to Nabawi, this is even better. We simply, stepped out from Zahret Mecca Hotel, and there stood Masjidil Haram (via Gate No 62 – Babu Al Umrah).  Mr Ayoob Anggulia, BOSS of Shahidah Travel and the leading ustaz, hospitably welcome us. So all geared, for next part of umrah, the tawaf.  As we took our steps into Masjidil Haram, following our ustaz, and followed every line of prayers he read out, I was nervous. Am I truly welcome to see the Baitullah? I heard many stories of it, unimaginable ones. When I first laid my eyes on Kaabah, tears profusingly ran down my cheeks, but my tongue never stopped saying out the prayers. We did the 7 rounds of tawaf. Mecca is truly the city that never sleeps. Not even New York or Las Vegas could compete with it. 24-7, congregates flocking in, praying, tawaf-ing. Subhanallah.  After the tawaf, we prayed facing the Pintu Kaabah, and read our du'a (it’s the best time to seek all forgiveness). I can't help crying again thinking of my past misdeeds. Dear Almighty, I truly hope You hear me.  After that (it's sunnah) we rested awhile drinking the Zam-Zam, facing the Kaabah, and more du'a read out, before we start our Sa'i.   Frankly, to me, Sa'i 7 times from Safa point to Marwah point is more challenging then tawaf. But thinking of Siti Hajar running up the then-hill Safa and Marwah water-searching for her thirsty child, Nabi Ismail a.s., made me persevere.  Alhamdulillah, after that the last bout in umrah practicum, is to cut off  @ least 3 strands of your hair. Some guys opt to shave clean, bald. My hubby reserving it for the next umrah, scheduled the next day.  The difference between Nabawi and Masjidil Haram is, the latter allows common entry for both males and females congregates. But when comes to Fardhu prayers, it will still be segregated.   After my first Maghrib prayers there, I decided to stay till Isyak. I performed my first tawaf sunat, alone. After completing the seventh round, I did the sunat prayer, and tried to give it a go to get near the Kaabah. I got to touch the cloth (kiswah) Kaabah, and like a nutty person, I laid my head near, and heave the nicely scented black material, until one guard came and shouted, 'Hajah, Haram!'  Next attempt was getting near to the Rukun Yamani, where solid part of the Kaabah is revealed. Pushed my way in, and I got to touch and kiss it. I thought it's not so tough after all, but I guess Almighty heard my sayings. My journey to Hajar Aswad was truly an obstacle. I saw a long queue, waiting patiently to get to the Hajar Aswad, but it seems unmoving, and no women at all. I headed straight to the front. After all the sandwiching, I only managed to touch the Black stone, after that I was thoroughly thrown out from the horde. Well, I was still thankful though. God’s willing, I told myself; I will get it other time.  After dinner, my parents introduced to us for ther 1st time to the famous Bin Dawood. Our Ustaz Baharudin, kept nicknaming it the Saudi’s rendition of our Mustafa Centre. My sister and I were salivating at the sights of Baskin Robbins and Haagen Daaz. There is Bodyshop too, tended by all males. Basically shop-tending here is all-male environment. Women, stay at home, tend the house and children, and husband. Mama and papa did all the shopping. Hubby and myself decided we would drop by ourselves some other night.  Another small thing I notice, whether it be in Medina or Mecca, every fardhu prayers will be accompanied with Solat Jenazah. Aren't they the lucky chosen ones to take their last breath in Holy City?  And my dearest hubby, seems can't keep his patience on tasting the famous Ayam Golek. This roasted chicken is really something, compare to ones we have here. For 10 riyal, it comes with 2 pcs of Naan-like bread, and fresh salad of cabbage, carrots, onions and lemon.    June 8th 2004 Tuesday   Hubby and rise 2am to perform our Tawaf Sunat. After completing, hubby told to rest while waiting for Subuh. I was a bit disappointed, because I thought with him around; he could assist me to get my Hajar Aswad. He told me he got it the day before, and I was a bit envious.   I haven't even warmed my butt bit to rest, but I felt a sudden pull, that I stood up and walk straight towards Kaabah. I don't know whether hubby realized my gone or not. But I simply got myself drown in the sea of people. This time round was tougher. 3 times I was thrown off the crowd. The men around do not recognized anymore the presence of women, so I told myself, I had to do it, and do it like a Man. I nudged my way in, my head got sandwiched, managed to released and dived in straight and planted my whole face on the Hajar Aswad.  For minutes, I experience, uber extreme tranquil. There seems to be no commotion behind me. Oh God, it smell so good, and did you hear my prayers?  Scheduled for this day after Asar was our second umrah (miqat in Hubaidiyah). We set off earlier morning, to visit historical parts of Mecca. If you guys know your Sirah well, after Adam and Hawa thrown out from Heaven, after consuming the forbidden Buah Kuldi, they were separated for 40 long years.   Adam in India, Hawa in Jeddah, they reunited again in Jabal Rahmah, one of the pitstops for the day. Single lads are encouraged to hike the Jabal Rahmah, stand infront of the white tower and prayed seeking for their other half.  We got to look-look-and-see-see Arafah, Mina, Muzdalifah, where those who perform Haj stay and perform their Lontar Jamrah. 2nd last stop before the Masjidil Haram And Kaabah Conservatism Museum visit, we got to visit the camel's farm. Got my first creamy taste of camel's milk. And their discharge could be mistaken as pebbles or even kurma basah. Tee hee hee…..  Doing tawaf after Asar was another bout of challenge, because the sun was really wild. Its scorching-heat-summer of 42 degree Celsius. But good thing, the condition of the humidity doesn't activate our sweat glands. So no sticky feeling. For those puteri-lilin, a tip; don’t leave your hotel room without your shades, moisturizer and lip balm. I enhanced my endurance of the heat by dunking lots of laban (yoghurt – Nadec is my favorite brand) and a bottle of pure drinking water mix with Redoxon effervescent daily.  After today's umrah, hubby and papa shaved bald, at the BarBar shop (barber). Hubby, you really look like a fishball head, tee hee hee    June 9th 2004 Wednesday   Set off early to 3rd miqat in Ji'rana to perform 3rd umrah. There used to be a well, which water believes to be miraculous, that could even cure paralysis and blindness. History to be said, Prophet Muhammad discovered the well, by tapping the spot. Unfortunately, by the show of the Almighty's strength, people's misusage of the well, drove the well to utter dryness.  After completing the 3rd umrah, managed to convince my sister to head for Hajar Aswad. This time round escorted by hubby and papa. 3 of us acted like barricade to my sister. I almost got my telekung torn in this process. Since I was infront of my sister and face to face with the Hajar Aswad, hubby asked me to take the first lung. But there was this Indian lady who simply did not want to take her two hands off, until the policeman standing at the multazam ordered her.  It's the same tranquil feeling like I first planted my face onto the pure stone. Right after that, I pushed sister to the front and I believed she’s experiencing the same kind of feeling as me.  Thanks hubby and papa.  Hubby and I attacked Bin Dawood, just the 2 of us this time round. We could not spent much, and the Money Changer seems the only corner to shut for business early. Thus, spent our last few hundred riyals on 2 dozens of tudung from this shop name Abatul Khaleej and a painting of the Masjid Al-Aqsa in Baitulmakdis from a shop run by and Indonesian-Jambi-origin guy who can't spoof his mother toungue.   Later, we sat at its 2nd floor eatery, quenching thirst with limejuice and munching fat fries, with breathtaking Masjidil Haram facing us. Why on earth did we leave our camera?    June 10th 2004 Thursday   The nearest and the 4th miqat Tana'im (just 6km from Masjidil Haram) and marks the 4th umrah we performing.  At that moment we also learnt, one of our jemaah, passed away 2am in the morning. He's an Imam of Masjid An-Nur, near my place. He just completed his sunat prayers and doing his dzikir near the Hajar Aswad. A Bangladeshi janitor discovered him, and fortunately he was wearing our group tag for recognition. He came down here with 3 of his grandchildren, 1 daughter, 1 son, a daughter-in-law and his son's father-in-law.  Atuk Haji Hashim, you will be greatly missed by your loved ones. I will always remember on how strong were you despite being 78 years old, compare to the young fellows, doing the jog during Sa’i. A prose of Al-Fateha for you.  We finally managed to convert our SGD to riyal. Thus, after lunch, I intended to do my own shopping, ONLY around the shops below our hotel. After every fardhu prayers, on the way back to the hotel, I'd always been eyeing on these ankle-cut boots. Finally I got my hands on it. The shopkeeper stated his first price at 60 riyal (SGD30).   Liza: 30 riyal, Halal. Shopkeeper: 55 riyal Liza: 35 riyal Shopkeeper: Laa' Laa'. 50 Halal Liza: 40 riyal, Halal. Shopkeeper: Halal, halal.   I tried the boots, handed him 50 riyal and he mentioned Halal. REMEMBER, don't reply Halal back again when you don't hand exact change. Or else you are implying to them to keep the change. But of course, I learnt this earlier, and said HARAM. He smiled and hesitatingly returned my 10 riyal.  And ever since that day, I was nicknamed PCK.  One thing here, the people practices Makan Berdamai. May it be the shopkeeper and assistants, the janitors in the mosque. They shall sit down either inside or outside the shops or any corner, lay out their spread of food, and eat together-gether. So tantalizing.    June 11th 2004 Friday  It's time for 1-hour tour on foot around Mecca City, lead by Ustaz Salam. Where stood with pride, the Hilton Hotel, was actually a former home of Sayidina Abu Bakar. Again, I question why the Sauds make way this kind of historic for commercialization?  At one part of Masjidil Haram, also denotes first time in history where the known-to-be-fierce Sayidina Umar, embraced Islam, even though minutes before he swore to behead Prophet Muhammad. His own sister embraced Islam, and he was soothed after being a render by his sister, a verse of Al-Quran that states about exactly the same incident.  Another part of Masjidil Haram, ever stood house of Prophet Muhammad and his beloved wife, Siti Khadijah. A few steps outside Masjidil Haram area, is the exact location where Aminah gave birth to Prophet Muhammad. The place has already been wakaf and turn to a library.  After that, we head to the famous Masjid Bendera (or better known as Masjid Kucing), which still undergo some repair/reno works. Facing the Masjid is the famous place for 'melontar' (another term for shopping), Pasar Zinc. Hubby managed to get an Oman jubah for only 10 riyal! And I bought 1 more dozen of tudung..And the ice-cream we savored there, is Power-Gedamak. We walked our way down, and past by Makam Ma’ala, and gave our salam to all those who have rested in peace. The last stop was another mosque, Masjid Jin, which was believed thousands of genies embraced Islam with presence of the Prophet. But don't expect to see genies around, ok.  It's my sole opportunity to perform my Friday prayers in Masjidil Haram. But I missed it. I showered and slept after the foot tour, was not feeling that well. Hubby tried to shook me up, but I was lost to the world. It was BIG REGRET. Only God knows how I feel.  After dinner, hubby and I did our last round of shopping in Bin Dawood. We bought our all-time favorite scent Baraqah from its direct distributor shop Al-Haramain, which goes for 100 riyal (50SGD) only. The earlier shop we patronized offered us 150 riyal. Good savings, right? We went back to the same shop that we bought tudung days back, Abatul Khaleej. This time round I have my hands on its exclusive Abayat (ladies' jubah). Finally I got a pair for myself. We also returned to the Jambi guy shop that we bought the Al-Aqsa painting. This time round bargaining for 10 mini ayat Kursi (for hubby's buddies) and wooden pencil case for SIL.  Had our supper, facing Masjidil Haram again. I really, really hope this set of photos will turn out well. We had limejuice and shrimp broast (bbq+roast) which comes with fat fries, briyani rice and naan.  Last shop-stop before we left Bin Dawood, was the Kingdom of Dates to succumb on our chocolatier mood with the dates. We love the dates coated with dark chocolates. Wish we had gotten more.     June 12th 2004 Saturday   In attempt to see Gua Hira', I hiked the Jabal Nur with less then 10 other folks. 2500m high, all rocky and bit sandy, I wonder how Siti Khadijah to and fro hike it, to send food to her beloved hubby, during his hideout in Hira’ from the Quraisy. I told hubby, if he's the one hiding, he would have died of starvation waiting for me.  I almost gave up innumerable of times. The sun right above my head, with my short stamina on my 2 foot and bad breathing, I questioned myself how possible I would get to the peak? At one point, I even vomited out every single liquid intake I had earlier. That was almost my turning point. Our very super-patient personal guide, from Kashmir, offered his blue hanky, and pulled me almost all the way up. I slowed down and stopped a while. Seeing my papa on top, encouraged me to go faster and further. By the time I got papa, I hugged him and wept like a little girl. He was so worried too, when he didn't see me in his sight.   I rested awhile before heading straight to Gua Hira'. There are lots of cats around, and while I was drinking, a few monkeys tried to snatch my water bottle. Naughty monkeys. The paths to the cave are really narrow. But never too narrow for my BIG volume hubby to past through. Alhamdulillah, this is one day I could never forget. Its berkat of saying lots of selawat. Thank you hubby. And not forgetting, our guide, Hussey Ghazal. 30 riyal as tip for him.  Back at hotel, was luggage-packing time again. Luggage to be outside our room by 10am. What? We're leaving already? So fast.    June 13th 2004 Sunday   At 9am, we gathered to perform our Tawaf Wada (Farewell Tawaf). The last time in front of Kaabah, I said our all my prayers in my typewritten prayer list, which has gone tattered into its many days. I couldn't help feeling all affectingly sad, and me already missing it before leaving. Masyallah. Dear Almighty, I hope You will invite me again to this Holy House of yours. I dearly want to very, very much. Now I could understand all those who 'story' to us, and expressing the repeated desires to go back there again. I am experiencing exactly the same kind of emotions. Farewell Mecca.  Its few minutes shy after 10am when we left for Jeddah, when our plane is only scheduled at 8pm. Well, this is all due to avoid the nasty traffic conditions there. Officials sent off our luggages to airport earlier. Each passenger is granted 30kg limit, not including 10 litre of Zam-zam.   Slightly before noon, we reached Jeddah Holiday Inn, As-Salam. This 5-star hotel is an operation center for Shahidah Travel. My parents got to stay one night during their Haj back in 2000. We had a sumptuous International buffet lunch there. This is one true time we could mingle around, exchange contacts and addresses.   I think I forget to mention earlier, that one of hubby's junior from EVSS, was in our tour group too. He came down with his parents and 2 younger brothers. Coincidentally, he’s my junior in SP, but he was doing Nautical Studies. These 3 brothers were nicknamed 3 Abdul. And the same 3 brothers were after a 19-year-old girl of French-Dutch-Malay descent in our group. Guys will always be guys.  After group pictures, we were treated by Mr Ayoob with gelato-like ice-cream and satay. Hubby and I, spent our last riyals on BIG sheesha (hoga) goes at 150 riyal. It's nicely packec in a standing bag, and the giftshop-owner so sweet to compliment us with one box of apple-flavored tobacco. We also managed to grab buy-5-get-1-free T-shirts, with Camel printed on it, with sayings Mafi Mushkila (No Problem). And lastly not forgetting the semi-contraban items, chewing gum.  After 4pm we boarded the airport transfer to KAA International Airport. Spending few hours in the departure area, obviously bring us to its DFS, Al-Musbah. Shout out to PS2 freaks out there, 10 PS2 going for 100 riyal (50SGD). How about that? That seems low end compare to my next discovery. A soft CK ladies boots, 630 riyals. You count and convert, ok. I still love my 'PCK' leather boots.   Leaving on a jet plane, and here we are heading home again. But I am already missing it.   We stopped by Dubai for one-hour transit, which is only less than 3 hours away from Jeddah. Suddenly, I start feeling the fatigue button activating. Body aching, eyes so sleepy. Strange, I don't feel much of all these before despite only two hours of solid sleep, enduring the very long day that knocks at you at 2.45 am and slumber you off at past midnight.    June 14th 2004 Monday   During the long flight, in between sleep and meals, I wonder what I've brought back with me? Apart from the 6-rolls of film (I should seriously consider a digital camera), built friendships, there are many, many more. It's a place I feel nearer to Him, and I hope this nearness remain though I'm back in my homeland. It’s one memory, I feel I really, really talk to Him, and He hears me, and show me His presence and strength. I think no words can ever describe. But all these will forever engrave in my heart. Thank you God, for inviting this little, humble one to such a splendid home of Yours.   12.15pm (SG time), touched down Singapore. Farewell hugs and kisses to all those friends I found in this meaningful trip. I saw my two flower girls and MIL waiting outside the arrival hall.   Well, I guess its Home Sweet Home, but I hope this episode will have its many, other sequels, if God's willing.
