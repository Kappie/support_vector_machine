Ahh nothing like a  urlLink Target  run.  Got some fake miniature plastic fruit to shove in my  urlLink  Hemingway Hurricane  glass along with some lovely  urlLink autumnal candles .  Add a festive halloween handtowel and I consider my contribution to decorating done.  Oh who am I fooling?  I will get the box of décor down and put out the stuff tomorrow.  Let the decorating season begin.........
