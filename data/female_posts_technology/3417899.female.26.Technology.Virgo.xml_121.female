I am going crazy.  I was in Boston earlier today. Weather on the East Coast was bad and my flight to Washington was delayed once. Then again, then again.  My colleague (The new SE, we'll call him Leon) and I decided to sit at the bar until our flight leaves. Now let me preface by saying I can't hold my alcohol well, and therefore, I usually avoid drinking in the presence of work colleagues. But I've been on the road for a week now, and was having a rough long day, and he was drinking, so I thought - what could go wrong? I'll have one, too.  Well, Leon ordered me a drink I had never tried, a   urlLink "Long Island Ice Tea"  . That was enough to put me over. I was drunk. And as a result, the conversation got carried away.  Interesting, isn't it, how drunken conversations always turn to sex? It's as if that's the only issue we ever really want to talk about deep in our unconscious selves...  I don't think I can remember everything that was said. I do remember sharing some stories of my promiscuous past (from long before I had settled down with my husband) and listening to some torrid tales on Leon's side. But I do know is this: My head hurts, I am tired, I've landed at the wrong airport, I have to get up too early tomorrow (umm..Actually today) and... Leon is never going to look at me the same way.  Darn, I've crossed a line.  Again .
