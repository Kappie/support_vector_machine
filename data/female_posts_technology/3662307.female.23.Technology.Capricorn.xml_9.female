Almost had an argument with Finance over the internal processes....So complicated. Sent the phone over to Derek.At 3pm, had an interview at Starbucks, Menara Prime. Nice talking to the Singaporean lady, a recruitment consultant. Then at 5pm, went over to Istana to collect the projector. Had a little chat with the trainer, Mr Sim. Got the vouchers for bfast. He he he...Oh yeah, today while walking back from lunch, saw ths guy picking his noise in his parked car at the roadside. Disgusting. Why people tend to do that when they are idle in the car???
