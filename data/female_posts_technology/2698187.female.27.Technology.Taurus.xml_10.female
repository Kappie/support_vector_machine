I tell ya...if I wasn't planning to call in slick next week, I wouldn't go in tomorrow. But a sista hordes her vacation time like a mutha!  Another day, another contract. I put contract #3 down today. A 1 bedroom with a den. Me and my Mom had a tiff because she feels like before I put down a contract, I should know the dimensions of the room. WTF??? I don't give a good goddamn about that shit. It could be fuckxsuck for all I care. All I care about is can I get my shit in there. I have seen this same place furnished and unfurnished. So I know what it is capable of holding. I got real pissy with her...mostly because I'm sick. She said that I sounded like a fool saying that I didn't care what the dimensions were. Tell her to come down here and try holding up getting your offer in to find out the muthafucking dimensions. She has no idea.  I still need to find a mini-me. Someone who likes to do the same things I like to do..and is willing to spend the money to do it. In actuality, I don't have money like I used to anymore. I overdrew my account this month...mainly because fucking Curves decided to be late with taking their money out so I forgot all about them. So in the pinch when I'm trying to stretch $75 for 4 days, they come along and fuck me up. Luckily, nothing bounced because I have my savings to back me up...and I'm not touching my money market. But I still don't like getting embarrased at the grocery store by having my card rejected. Eventually, I think I'm going to have to go into NACA and get my savings amount reduced. It's too much. I can't live like I want to on $300-$400 after the bills/savings are paid. It's summer gotdamnit!  I'm trying to become a mystery shopper. I filled out some of the applications online so I'm just waiting for some assignments. That should be interesting.  I received the invitation to Koritha's shower. I guess I can at least go to that. I haven't heard from her regarding my note about not being able to make her wedding. I don't know what that means. I really don't care though...is that bad? I just can't spend the money. If it was local, yea. But I just don't have the desire to travel to upstate NY for a wedding this year. That's money I don't have.  I look forward to the weekend. Nothing really planned. I get my Sex and the City DVD's from Vange. So if I'm sick, you know what I'll be doing this weekend.
