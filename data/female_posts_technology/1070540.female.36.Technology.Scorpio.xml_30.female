It is so wonderful to see him as happy as he has been the last two weeks.  I keep telling him I have all the confidence in the world in him.  He doesnt realize sometimes just how smart he is.  Its just not smart.,  Its the Knowledge that he has and his ability to actually put it to use.  I think that is one of the things that attracts me to him too...I love a smart man.    Ok now on a uggh note.....I dont know why I am so afraid to show him how much I love him. I tried last week, but it was at the wrong time, and was accused of just loving on him cause he got that job.  Which isnt the truth...but did want to show him how proud I was/am of him.    Another note:  I am so glad that our baby Brian is back home.  Last week, we all 5 missed him so much....but this week I am having real problems missing the oldest 3.  I dont know when the last time it has hurt this much not to have them with me.  I am so lonely for them.   I am also having some serious problems with sleep...I cant seem to do it.  I am tired.  but cant seem to sleep...What is up with that??  My medicine for calming my nerves is missing as well.  Thats a whole other story....
