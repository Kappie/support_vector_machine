I'm looking for ways to entertain myself for if I combine immense boredom with immense tiredness, the result will be me falling asleep at my desk and I can't have that. It's not even noon and I have already taken my online class, signed up for fall classes, spoke with M (who got yelled at by a Wisconsin store clerk last night for trying to buy beer after 9 pm), spoke with mom about tomorrow's birthday plans, attended a meeting, and eaten my lunch. I have nothing left to do and 5 hours in which not to do it.   On the bright side, my French class is fabulous. Everyone in the class is a Europhile and the tiny little lady professor wears clothing that depicts the french flag. My speaking skills have improved tremendously and I can now say 'Rather than a suppository, I prefer a lozenge for my cough". The downsides of my 4-hour bi-weekly class is that my room looks like a tornado swept through it and I'm always tired the next day. Bleh.
