But then it's over, and you have a shower, and you sit down to blog about it, and it feels great.  Running, that is.  My analogy ended in the first paragraph.  You weren't still trying to make it work for this one, were you?  Anyway, I didn't do myself any favors by not running for nearly a week.  In case you're curious, a combination of factors including illness, DIY-mania, and heavy rain contributed to my sloth.  Tonight I went out thinking, "Do I really have to bother with the run-walk nonsense?  Can't I just run out for 10 minutes, then run back for 10 minutes?"  The answer is no.  I did the same run as before, and by the end of the second repetition I looked over at my house (which faces the park) and seriously considered running home right then, jumping the fence, and going in the back door.  Then I remembered that my back door was locked (safety first, kids!) and that in order to get home I'd have to go back the way I came, round the corner, and down the road again.  And by the time I thought of all the logistics, my repetition was over.  Later, something funny happened on my 4th repetition: I started running, and suddenly the 3 minutes was over, just like that.  I thought I must have shortchanged myself or read my watch wrong, but no: it just went like a hot knife through butter.  Mmmm, butter.  Ahh, that's the other thing.  I haven't had much food today, which might have contributed to my near crash early in the run.  I tried to eat a toasted bacon and guacamole sandwich for lunch, but someone really needs to tell the ladies in the canteen that guacamole should only be served ice cold.  Hot guacamole is nastified.  Oh well, at least there were pink wafers in the tea room.
