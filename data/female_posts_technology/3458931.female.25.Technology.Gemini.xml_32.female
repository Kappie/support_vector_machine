Working for the Canadian Forces has it's perks, as 'morale' and 'quality of life' are words tossed around frequently. Yesterday they meant our commanding officer sent every non-essential personnel home at noon!  I was preparing to spend the afternoon at home, primping myself for a dinner date later, but the guy I was not expecting to see until dinner skipped out from work early so we could head to Mactaquac for some swimming. Well I guess I did all the swimming, and not very much, but it was the best place to spend a sunny afternoon. Later he made me the most fabulous dinner, yes I said HE made ME dinner. We talked about EVERYTHING, he showed me some Aikido moves, we stopped at a yard sale, I met his brother and his friend Chris, and we topped the evening off with a moonlight walk and some ice cream. I drove home with a sweet, soft goodnight kiss on my lips and I was so wiped out I fell immediately asleep.  That man made me feel like the luckiest, most special girl in the world last night. I think I'm smitten. Is smitten the right word? From urlLink  m-w.com :  "5: CAPTIVATE, TAKE  smitten  with her beauty>"  That I can go with. But then...
