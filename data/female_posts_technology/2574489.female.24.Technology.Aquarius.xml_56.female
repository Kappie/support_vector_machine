The food was great but our server was so bad! I hate bad service.  Anyway, we just tried to ignore her; we didn't want to ruin a good experience. We had calamari for appetizers, and Woody and I split an order of chicken marsala.  We had tiramisu and berry crostada for dessert as well as a couple of glasses of wine.   Oh at the end, woody wrote the server a note that he thought would "help" her, along the lines of find another job.  I bet she spat in our food.    On another note, I think I'm gonna have to give up my wish list as I visited 24 HR Fitness Super Sport center over the weekend and I want to join badly.  It'll cost me about $200 to do so if I go with the cheapest plan. I used to be a member of another 24 HR gym but it was nothing like this.  Goody bye wishlist!  (Edited to add: Except for my trips of course...that's still a go!)  Hope everyone is less broke than I am.
