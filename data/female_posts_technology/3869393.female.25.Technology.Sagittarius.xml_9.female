Does your heart ache and break when they're sad? Then it's love.  Do you cry for their pain, even when they're strong? Then it's love.  Do their eyes see your true heart, and touch your soul so deeply it hurts? Then it's love.  Do you stay because a blinding, incomprehensible mix of pain and relation pulls you close and holds you there? Then it's love.  Do you accept their faults because they're a part of who they are? Then it's love.  Are you attracted to others, but stay with them faithfully without regret?Then it's love.   Would you allow them to leave you, not because they want to but because they have to? Then its love.  Would you give them your heart, your life, your death? Then it's love.  Now, if love is painful, and tortures us so, why do we love? Why is it all we search for in life? This pain, this agony? Why is it all we long for? This torture, this powerful death of self? Why? The answer is so simple cause it's...LOVE. It is such an addiction that even people who are not having it wish to experience and share it with .
