"Over here."  She looked toward the fence and saw a boy hanging over it watching her with curious eyes. "I was meditating." She said quickly in hopes that it would put him off and make him go away.  Apparently it didn't work. "What is meditating?" He asked with the same expression.  She sighed. "Mediatation is a way in which a person can relax and control their breathing in hope of understanding this world." She stood up and slapped her jeans to knock the grass off. She was sitting under a small tree in hopes that no one could see her and wonder at her actions. No such luck.  "That's weird. You must be a weird girl. What is your name? I'm Tommy and I just turned ten years old. How old are you? I am staying here for the summer. Do you mind if I play with you? There is nothing to do at my grandma's house. My parents are too busy for me to stay at home this summer. What about you?"  Alecka took a deep breath for him. She certainly hoped he wouldn't ask questions all summer or it could be very interesting. "Nice to meet you, Tommy. My name is Alecka and I just turned eleven myself. I don't mind if you want to play though it will have to be after my studies."  "Don't you get a summer break? That would be awful. I don't like school. Kids pick on me and I don't like that. I do like to read though. Do you like to read?" He leaned even futher across the fence.  Alecka hoped he didn't fall over the fence. She took another breath to answer the next set of questions. "No I don't get a summer break. I am taught at home on a more advanced rate and I like to read myself. What is your favorite book?" She asked a question before he could. She felt a small achievement for this success. It should definitely prove to be an interesting summer.  "I like adventures like Treasure Island and Tom Sawyer. What about you? Have you read those books?" He asked eagerly.  "Yeah, those books are great. I'll have to show you my collection in case you want to borrow some over the summer to read."  "Oh that would be excellent. My grandma doesn't have much. Like I said it is boring here." He scrunched his face as he said that.  "Why don't you come inside for some cookies and milk? Will that be all right?" Alecka asked quietly as she led the way to the front of the yard to the gate.  "Let me just run in quickly and let her know and I'll be right over." With that he bounded away to the house and Alecka opened the gate and sat on the porch to wait.  In a few minutes he bounded out of the house and ran through the gate. "She says it's fine. She knows your mom and dad and she says that they are good people."  "Well come in then. My mom is working in her office so we'll have to be quiet in the kitchen." Alecka led the way into the house.
