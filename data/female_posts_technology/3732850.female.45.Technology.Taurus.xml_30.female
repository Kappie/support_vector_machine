I worry about school, my parents, my sister and her children. When I don't have some one to worry about, I seem to find some thing to worry about. Are the kids safe? Did my husband eat lunch? Did I remember to turn the iron off before I rushed out of the house? Did I remember to get all of my homework done? Is my sister doing okay after her husbands death? How are her children doing?  I rarely think about the time I spend worrying about all of these things, but every once in awhile I get a little selfish. I have to wonder, when is the last time I worried about me? I then realize that it has been a very long time since I have given much thought to myself. I used to enjoy reading, cross stitching, walking and even just sitting quietly all by myself every now and then. I can't remember the last time I have had the time to do any of those things. What would I do with time to myself and nothing to worry about?  If I could imagine a perfect afternoon all to myself it would have to be.... laying on our porch swing on a sunny afternoon. The birds are singing, the wind is blowing just enough to make the leaves rustle. The sun is shining on the back of the porch swing just enough to keep it comfortably warm. I am getting sleepy as the swing moves back and forth. I have been reading a wonderful book for too long and my eyes have grown tired. I close my eyes. As I lay there quietly taking in all of the sounds and smells of the beatuiful afternoon, I doze off. I sleep so soundly, not worrying about anything. No telephones ringing, no schedules to follow, no meals to be cooked and no laundry to be done. I sleep for hours. I don't dream. I am not worrying.   As I slowly awake, I realize that the warm sun has begun to disapear from the sky because the warmth on the back of the swing is no longer there. What a wonderful afternoon nap I have had. The birds are still singing and the leaves are still rustling and all of a sudden........ I here a screen door slam and then I here Mom, where are you? I'm home!
