I am still getting calls from the job I just left about on-going "issues" that didn't get cleared up when I originially quit. Thats the least of the things on my mind to get done NOW. 1) Register kids for school 2) buy another vehicle 3) learn to drive in the snow 4) Get groceries .  That month was crazy. Not only was I completely ( and literally) out of my element here in Idaho, I am out of my comfort zone too. All of our stuff was still packed in boxes in the garage. The new rugs weren't in yet so we were living on bare floors, no dishwasher, no oven (the previous owners had busted it), no bed (just mattresses), no internet, and worse, no TV to keep the kiddos occupied. With no time off after we moved here, GD immediately reported to his new worksite and I was stuck at home to sort through it all.  At first the snow was enchanting, to wake up each morning and look out the huge sliding window to see our new backyard blanketed with new snow. The dog loved it, the kids loved it, the cats had no clue what was going on and hated it. It was fun for the first three months until the "non-fun" snow stuff started to happen, kids slipping and falling, me slipping and falling, me trying to simply drive to the neighborhood grocery. All skills we didnt have to contend with while in California. To top this whole adventure off, I now needed to find the sports store to gear the kids up for the snow, from boots to heavy coats to gloves and hats. Needless to say, more driving.   Fast forward, May 2004   OK, we made it through the snow. Now its time to make it through the heat. No problem! This is something that I can handle! Right?! Except for being laid up for two months for a hurt back from pulling all the weeds in the yard, I am doing good. It is AMAZING how over grown this place can get in a matter of days. I am late in planting my first garden ever because of my back injury. But I did manage to get tomatoes, zucchini's, chili peppers, bell peppers and some watermelon planted.  So much has happened in the last 8 mos. It would take Blog after Blog to go through it all. Needless to say, we have settled down nicely with some bumps and grinds and everyone seems to be happy??? Right??  I feel that these first few blogs will be more-so like a "diary" then what I originially plan it to be, a place to discuss topics that, selfishly, I am trying to address in my own life and hopefully there are others out there with similiar issues....
