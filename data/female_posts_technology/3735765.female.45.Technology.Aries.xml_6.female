I will be sharing these posts with you on the upcoming posts.  I hope that you will enjoy and share the excitement that I felt as I embarked upon this new journey! :))     O God,  forgive the poverty, the pettiness, Lored, the childish folly of our prayers .  Listen, not to our words, but to the grownings that cannot be uttered; hearken, not to our petitions, but to the crying of our need.  So often we pray for that which is already ours, neglected and unappropriated; so often for that which never can be ours; so often for that which we must win ourselves; and then labor endlessly for that which can only come to us in prayer . . . O give us to love thy will, and seek thy kingdom first of all.  Sweep away our fears, our compromise, our weekness, lest at last we be found fighting against thee.  Amen.  -- William Edwin Orchard Sometimes, our prayers can seem quite petty -- especially when, at our lowest of times, we have much more than out global neighbors might have.  I think, though, that our fear is that we may get in the same situation as them.  Thank goodness that most of us have our good health.  I am worried about my cousin though  hope that God is hearing our prayers for her.
