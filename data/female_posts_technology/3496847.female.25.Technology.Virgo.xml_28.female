My aptartment is disorganized, I haven't put anything on the walls (I've lived here for 2.5 months), my comp needs to be cleaned and organized properly, I want to reorg my blog to have a seperate area for crochetting, I'm selling some stuff on  urlLink eBay , I've got another dentist appointment and errands to to run.
