Saturday Morning I woke up feeling quite good even after a night of drinking. I presume this was because I had the foresight to drink a couple glasses of water between alcoholic beverages. Saturday morning(-ish) I ventured to Kerbey Lane Cafe and had their Berkeley salad without cheese and Ginger Soy dressing.  mmmm I did have some tofu and vegetable stir-fry that I had delivered on later Saturday afternoon when I was too lazy to actually bike to the grocery store and pick up some produce.  Sunday morning I woke up rather early @ 6:30am, and went for a long bike ride of about 18-20 miles after having a banana for breakfast. I then went home and took a nap and then made my trip to the grocery store and got as much produce as I could pack into my backpack.  Breakfast today: Snow Peas Sprouts (I have to eat them before they go bad, you know?)  Today's Lunch includes: 3/4 med. tomato 1 green onion 1 ear of corn (yes, raw) a couple handfuls of some rather sad looking broccoli.  I imagine I'll be discarding most of it.
