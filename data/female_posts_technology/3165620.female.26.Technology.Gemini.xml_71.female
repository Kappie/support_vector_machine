(Oh, who am I kidding, I just want to be able to talk on the phone while I'm in the laundry room folding my clothes.)  It would be helpful to have a cell phone when I'm traveling. I've been looking at  urlLink Verizon Wireless , since they got pretty good marks in Consumer Reports. I need to decide how many minutes I would need in a plan. I'll think about it later. Right now, I want to get something to eat!
