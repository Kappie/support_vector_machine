Fuel - "Falls On Me"     You see me hanging round  starting to swear about this black hole of a dark field  and silently within hands touchin skin sharp  breaks my disease and i can breath   and all of your ways  all you dream falls on me  it falls on me  and your beautiful sky  the light you breath  falls on me  it falls on me ahha  i feel like a pain  it draws me in again sqaushes all my worst of me  darkness in my veins  I never could explain  and i wonder if you have ever seen  and still believe   /chorus  am I that strong  to carry on  have i changed your life  have i changed my world could you save me ahhhhha   /chorus  /chorus
