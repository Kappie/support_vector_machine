Yes ,... I have gained some weight... I can get it off ...... I know I can....  and you know what else ................... I can run a network too ... I will be given a chance... and I will prove it to everyone.  I also...will prove to TERRY SR>  that I am not scared of his ass no more and I will get  my kids.  and Ken and I will have a wonderful family with our 4 kids.  I even understand why he doesnt want a 5th.  I am not upset with that any more either.  I Love my Ken with all my heart.  I will always want one of his children.  BUT... I know 5 is alot.   I will always love ken.  We always tease around about how much we love each other.  But let me tell you, the way he makes love to me, the way he makes me feel, no matter what I look like whether its a day that I feel like crap or a day I feel sexier than ever..he always tells me I am beautiful.  I know GOD meant for me to meet him.. and to love him... he knew exactly what each of us needed. .... BABY if you read this....I LOVE YOU
