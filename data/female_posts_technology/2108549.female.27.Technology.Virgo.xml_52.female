This working thing has seriously cut into my social life! :) Friday I worked and then went and watched an awesome movie at Ju's.  Chinese food and a good movie and good convo equals a good night. Saturday was a little shopping.  I needed to get new clothes for work.  It was time and while I had enough to get through last week, there was no way I could go through the same 5 outfits again.  So I got a buncha stuff!  Almost everything was 50% off and I got awesome deals all the way around.  Sunday was dinner at an old friend's house.  A few of the pictures have been posted already.  Things are good just seriously busy.  I think I might have to let a couple commitments go.  I admit, I am a wimp.  I like my down time, in fact, my down is essential for me not getting sick.   Life is life though.  Its going really good.  So good that how it looked 6 months ago and how it looks now are two different beasts altogether!  And that my dear, is a good thing.
