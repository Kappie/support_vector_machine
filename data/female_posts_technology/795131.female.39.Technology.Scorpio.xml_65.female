We can't hire back those we laid off now that we're hiring again 1 month later, as officially in their employee records we documented each of them was let go for performance issues (but didn't tell them).  Bulk email from various executives tell us what spin we should put on all our bad news if anyone asks.  Husband hates his new job even though it pays more, might quit  try to go back where he came from.  Beautiful 10 year old daughter slipped in the bathtub this week end and chipped a small part of a front tooth off. Dentist smoothed it, but says you can't restore that part of a front tooth because it's too "high stress."  4 year old son will be 5 in 2 weeks, but is such an angry, destructive boy. Last night husband was out, son just hit us (me and his sister) over and over and kept throwing shoes and toys.  What I have going for me: I make a full time pay check (such as it is) and still get off at 3:00 and can pick my daughter up as she gets off from school and take her straight home like an at-home mom. I work so close to home and so close to my kids' school and day care it is not even funny. My new desk is right under the heating vent! Its so tropical at my new desk! I have 30 days off to take by December 31, 20 vacation days, 8 sick days, and 2 personal floating holidays; and every few weeks I work on a Saturday and get a week-day off in return! I surf the internet at my desk all the time, so far no one's complained, although it could happen  at any time. Any networking guy could figure it out, but I don't think anyone really checks. But like I said, they could. The Adam and the Ants bullitin boards I check frequently really cheer me up!   Sorry I'm such an incredible downer today.
