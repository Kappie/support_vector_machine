Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to announce that our relationship has exited the workplace and is alive and present in our outside-of-work lives. Saturday night, ladies and gentlemen, s-a-t-u-r-d-a-y night. Reality and fantasy are now blurring. Get ready to catch the imminent babies that will be shooting out like half-Vietnamese Romanian gymnasts. It will be a spectacle - a fiery fertile showcase - and I won't have to wear pants.  The night before when XX was driving me home, I told him I was going to the Azure Ray show and he goes, "Oh my friend is going to that." So when XX called on Sat, he said his friend had an extra ticket and he couldn't decide whether to go to Azure Ray or his friend's band, Tom Jonesin. I was like, "Puh-leeze, you are going to the show, I am going to pick you up in my mom's car, and it will be fun." I was not that cool though. If you heard me talking you would've thought I was doing Jerry Stiller. I was talking too loud and shouting into the phone like an excitable old incontinent man. What can I say. I was excited.  I was going to meet W-gal and R-dude at the show, but before I picked XX up, I left a breathless message on W-gal's voicemail apologizing in advance if I act strange because, reality, fantasy, BLURRING. I picked up XX and we drove to the club. We got there around 9pm, but stayed in my mom's car and listened to this old mix tape I found because his friend wasn't going to show up with the ticket until 9:30. He was in high spirits and I don't know if he was on drugs or drink or what, but it was a relief to me that I didn't have to worry about him having a good time: he is self-entertaining. He also has a Minnesota accent that is becoming more apparent as he says the word "bar" more.  At the show, I found myself tapping and patting him on the arm a lot. Apparently I am in love with him. So says my tap-and-pat-crazy hands. He disappeared after David Dondero and I was distraught because we moved up and what if he couldn't find me? Normally I am sane because I'm sober, but that night I'd polished off 3 Captain  Cokes, and I was feeling a little emotional. Alcohol turns me from an empty mechanically-wired robot into a human with arteries and veins and a beating heart. During Azure Ray's set I was freaking out and W and R were very supportive and calmed me down from my beverage-induced hysteria. Here is a clip of in-between song conversation I had with them:  Me: Where is he? He HAAATES me! He thinks I'm boring and stupid!  Them: He does not think you're boring and stupid. You should just go find him and talk to him!  Me: NOOOOO!!! That reeks of despair! I don't want to be desperate! What if he's trying to hook up with that girl who's his "friend"? I don't want to be all intruding on that!  Them: Fine. Stay with us. You choose to stay with us. You don't need him.  Me: That's right. That's right! I choose you guys! I choose you guys!  [Azure Ray play a song.]  Me (turning around to talk to them): I am going to use this Captain and Coke to catch my tears. I think I want to stand right next to you guys so that you're my equals. I don't want to stand in front of you just because I'm short.  Them (now standing beside me): Ok. But now you have a really tall dude standing in front of you.  Me: AAK! I can see XX from here. He's standing by the side. I cannot handle this! Give me back my spot! He is talking to another girl! He wants to make babies with her!!!  Them: That *girl* is our friend Michelle. You just met her, remember? He's only talking to her because we introduced you two to her when you first got here, remember?  Me: Oh yeah. (I keep quiet and enjoy the rest of the set.)   Highlights From My Date(?)   1. On the ride home he says, You've been pretty nice to me lately, and I say, it is because you are from Minnesota. I like people from Minnesota. There are a lot of Minnesotans who've married into my family and he jokingly blurts out, "OK! I don't know what you expect to happen tonight, but-ah, maybe you should buy me dinner first!"   2. We were on Haight St after the show and he goes, so do you ever come by this area? And I said, "Yeah, I buy my shoes here" just as he says, "You probably buy your shoes here." We jinxed on "shoes". Are we going to be lovers now? Or is he Luke and I, Leia?  3. There were some bums on Haight St. with a boombox playing Peter Gabriel's "In Your Eyes" and he chuckles, "It's the 'Say Anything' Song."  And I say in my faux-bum voice, "I'm LLoyd Dobler!" and in a 2nd-bum voice, "Gimme that boombox,  I'm  Lloyd Dobler!" And, oh my lord, I'm going to cream my office corduroys, XX starts to recite the LLoyd Dobler speech. The one that goes, "I do not want to buy or sell anything. I do not want to be part of anything that is bought or sold..." I, in my heart of personal hearts, love that speech and now I  like XX more because he knows that speech. Dammit, love!   Lowlights From My Date(?)   1. I use the parenthetical question mark, because it was not a date. Not really. He did not grope or maul or feel or pet me. In fact, there was no contact at all from him to me. R says that XX is a classic case of a man who just broke up with his girlfriend and just wants to have a good time. I have to consider this assessment, because I can't read XX's mind. I don't know how he feels about me, or if he feels at all.   2. Several times during the course of the evening, when introducing me to friends, or making random disclaimers, he would say, "I don't know you that well" or "this is kind of awkward because I hardly know you" or stuff like that. Apparently he doesn't see me like I see him. Because I don't say things like that to people. My theory is this: "I know what I know, and that's enough for now. Let's continue." Is that the same thing? To me, everytime he said a phrase that had that "I don't know you" meaning or weight, I felt a smidge disheartened, because, really, I would've preferred: "I feel like I've known you my whole life."   3. The end of the night when I dropped him off was a little uncomfortable for me because I've never been on an adult date before where I drop someone off. What is my line? Usually my brain is a teleprompter and I just read the lines, but there were no lines. There was no script, no screenplay. Only a blank. He invited me up, sort of, but I said no I was going to go home and close my eyes and he said, I hope you don't close them while you're driving, and I shook my head. I wasn't tired at all, but I just wanted to get away from the  Is this where we kiss? Does he even want to kiss me? How am I going to kiss him with a seat belt on? Is this even a date? I want him to kiss me. But I can't even look at him.  The entire dropoff I did not look at him. I couldn't. I stared at the steering wheel, hoping a teleprompter would appear on the horn. I waited for him to go inside, and he came back to the car, and he goes, "Are you waiting for me to go inside?" and I said, all embarrassed, "Well, yeah." And he goes, I'm going to smoke a cigarette, but I already have my keys.  And I -channelling Jerry Stiller again- shout, "Okay! Bye!" and I drive off into the night. Oh, sweet uncouth youth, how I hate thee.
