There was this one time where I had a dream was so perfect I wanted to write it down but I didn't, and yes the dream had to do with a guy. one that was perfect. Oh I remember this other thing that I thought I should write down, the entertiment we have here in Iowa. The other day me and my beloved friends Angelika and her son Amos went to  watch fireflies over corn fields, it was trully great, but that the entertiement we have here in Iowa. anyways later.
