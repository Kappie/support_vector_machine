That's something Mark and I have in common--we are genetically related to psychopaths who insist their problems are our fault. And we look at each other in amazement at the sheer gall of it all.  When Mark's mother sent the letter five years ago informing Mark that she still wanted a relationship with him despite the fact that he was a horrible person and she a hapless victim, Mark ignored it. He started ignoring her soon after she was committed for trying to kill him when he was a child. Back then they had places for people like that.  So I think I will do the same from the letter I got from my sister today, which informed me that I am a very sick woman in desperate need of psychiatric help and medication, for the sake of my husband and innocent son. She wrote with such dramatic compassion that Mark couldn't help read it to me with his best Hal J. Todd Oral Interp style--a reference only San Jose State Theatre grads will get, but I don't guess anyone's reading this, anyway.    Good God, she's good. Manipulative, well spoken, and can really convince you that the problem is really you. I could actually fall for this stuff, I can really see how people fell, hook, line and sinker.  She's better than Mark's mother, though she doesn't know how to use a comma, either. Mark's mother is a piker compared to my sister Heidi.  I think I'll keep the letter as an example of just how manipulative a true psychopath can be.  I don't think I'm angry anymore. I don't think I'm anything. I tried to muster up some emotion about getting this letter, but it rang false. My provincial parents are just raw meat for this bloodsucker, and I can't do anything about it. I just can't worry about it.  No, instead I need to worry about other people's lives. Dear Thomas, you dear sweet man, you've really managed to mess up your life, haven't you? It's painful for me because I'm helpless to stop you; it's like you've traveled back in time, you know what's going to happen to the Titanic but insist on boarding it anyway. You're a mass of raw nerves and I can only even recognize portions of your personality.  I wish I could help you. It frustrates me that I can't. All I can do is wait and hope you don't get swallowed up completely.    This entry is not much for structure, but I'm really tired and don't feel like being terribly witty or literary right now.  But at least the score is Psychopaths-0, Pam -1.
