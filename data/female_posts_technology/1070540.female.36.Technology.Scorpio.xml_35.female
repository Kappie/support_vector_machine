Ken and I got into an arguement on the way down there.  I didnt realize how unhappy I made him.  He gave me an ultimatum. I have to get the house clean in 2 days or he leaves me.  I am worried til I am so sick.  I hated leaving my mom.   I had to make my kids (well atleast 2 of them) go with their dad cause they did not want to. And now I am so worried that I am loosing him.  He has been asking me what is wrong.  I dont want him to know I am worriing.  I actually feel like I am going to throw up.  I hate feeling ill.  But I do not want to go through life with out him.  The sad thing is ....  I truely understand why he would leave me and I dont blame him an inch.  I wish I could be a better wife.  I am going to pray all night that GOD makes me a better wife and mother.  I feel so lonely tonight.  I want to be held.  I am no where near having the house clean.  but If I dont lay down I will get sick.   I just wish I could sleep some.  I do love him so.
