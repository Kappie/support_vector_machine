Seri - Flying with SIA, married. Alicia - Masters in Material Sci, seeing an Indonesian Shawn - Masters in Chem, unattached at the moment. Simin - Masters in Archi, seeing a Brit Cheryl - Working with a startup, enjoying her job, heading to India this yr end on a pilgrimage, seeing a Msian.  Suddenly, i realise a trend. A growing female proportion are not seeing local Singaporean men. I mean outta that 6 females, 4 (including myself) are seeing men from other countries whilst 1 is unattached and the other married to a native Malay.  That is pretty interesting.  Cheryl was telling me that there is such a thing called a Working holiday visa, where u can be employed over ur holiday. And she is thinking of applying for one since her Msian boy is currently in UK.  *gasp* me too.. so i can be with my dearie in Melb.  I looked up on holiday visa to Aust ... ============================================================ Nationals of some countries (who are under 31 years of age) are able to obtain a Working Holiday Maker visa that allows short term employment combined with visiting Australia for up to one year. At this stage, Singapore nationals are NOT entitled to working holiday visas. Check Fact Sheet 55 at  www.immi.gov.au  for more details and a list of eligible nationalities. ============================================================  to my disappointment.................... *sigh*
