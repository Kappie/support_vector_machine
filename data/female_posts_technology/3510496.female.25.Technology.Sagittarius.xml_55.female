This brings me back to some beginning and ending scenes of a movie, 'Love Actually'; Heathrow, London. If you've watched it, you will get what I mean...  'I feel it in my fingers ... I feel it in my toes .....'  *goosebumps*  Talking about LOVE, I met some lovely ladies on Saturday, and got to sit by the river with them. In the midst of the 'river-sickness', we sipped our 'minuman bijik kopi', ate my wedges   urlLink her  chickens, 'dig' into the married ones' wedding albums, posing some more for some unofficial album, and not forgetting, did what WOMEN do best; chat  gossip.   urlLink She  was my so-called 'long, lost junior', which I'd never thought I'd lost her; because we never met throughout our ENTIRE 'Budak Bukit Clan' days. Everybody knows her and everybody knows me. But we don't know each other. Strange.  So  my  the 'long, lost junior'  urlLink cousin , I consider the 'establisher' of the whole 'Mistaken Identity' (MI) incident. I thought I saw  urlLink her  in this  urlLink pic . But the cousin actually led me to the idea it was  urlLink her . And ohhh, on that very same pic, I spotted a long, lost  urlLink pal , who seems really, really lost  Thanks to the cousin too, she got me connected to another long, lost pal, whom I'd ever went out on double-dates. Hihihi ... And this pal coincidentally was a pal of the long, lost pal I'd mentioned earlier, plus to be a sister of  urlLink her . Phew! So much of this blogging world.  And again, so much of this blogging world plus the joy of bloghopping,  urlLink she  found me! This time, no mistaken identity. She was indeed in that pic.  2 more lovely ladies,  urlLink 'she no. 1'  and  urlLink 'she no. 2'  joined us in the seat-by-the-river, to 'spice' more things up. Naughty me managed to snatch 'she no. 1' passport and revealed to the World Wide Web (WWW) her real name (go and check my latest PHLOG).  What more can I say? We sure had fun, Fun, FUN! Lucky no one was tipsy enough reeking of caffeine, attempt to jump into the river.  Pics I'm afraid I have to pilfer from unofficial photographers  urlLink no. 1 ,  urlLink no. 2  and  urlLink no. 3 .  Hurry up, hurry up you people, share-share the pics, ok.   Click here for  urlLink more .   urlLink     And yeah,  urlLink she  couldn't make it with us, for the name of Teacher-meet-the-Parents session. Don't worry Rose, I truly understand. Guess I will see you on your wedding. :)
