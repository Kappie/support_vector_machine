The afternoons are long and quiet.   I had the following conversation through email with  urlLink Kelly  yesterday.  It broke up my day enough to entertain me.  This is my typical day.   Cynthia:   Blah.   Kelly:     Yup.    Cynthia:   Create database.           Database don't work.           Delete database.            Rinse.           Repeat as necessary.           All day long.   Kelly:     Package software.           Package don't work.           Ask for help.           No help available.           Use brain to come up with completely new way of doing things.           Finally works.            I'm not paid enough.   Cynthia:   I'm not paid at all.  They reward me at the end of the week in coupons.   Kelly:     You get coupons!!!! Lucky. I get to search the cushions in the lobby.   Cynthia:   I bargained up to coupons, and had to threaten to quit in order to get them.  I used to have to break open the sanitary dispenser in the ladies' room for change.  Don't complain; the lobby is where visitors with real jobs sit and drop their money.  I bet you make a killing there.   Kelly:     You would think so.
