His mother and father are so sweet and thoughtful...and his grandma..Ohh I love that woman! She's in her 80's and loves to talk (much like myself).  You should hear her.....she says the funniest things.  She turned to Jeff last night and said.."Sarah has a really nice bustline you know?" ha ha ..he just laughed and said "Yeah,  You said that before.." She holds nothing back and is a strong woman.  I like that.   She also has a great sense of style at her age.  She was wearing this very nice ensemble last night.  I absolutely loved it on her.  I wanna dress just like her when I am her age.  You know how old people usually wear clothing that looks like it should be on a 4 year old?  Well,  not her....she  knows exactly what to wear....not too old and not too young.... just right.  I told Jeff I can only hope to have such a great sense of style at that age.  One thing I do know for sure is I will never be caught dead in "holiday promotional wear"....you know the kind.....skeleton earings.that make "scary" noises....homemade sparkle bat t-shirts...that glow in the dark...or the ohh so common....candy cane earings....with santa sweaters...and.... jingle bells...can't leave them out . I'm serious.  I hope I don't sound mean...but fo' reall. Even at a young age...elementary school....when teachers of mine wore stuff like that..I somehow innately knew that it was just WRONG.  So wrong.  I don't mind socks though.  I actually like those.  I love holiday socks.  I just hope that isn't the beginning of the addiction for me.  Must limit myself to one pair of holiday socks every few years.  Prevention.  Anyway...way too much time spent on that.    Jeff, his brother, and I went and saw "Supersize me" in Royal Oak after dinner.  That movie was absolutely incredible. I  advise every last one of you to see it...so good.  He has three doctors,  and gets all kinds of tests done to document his health before going on a Macdonalds binge for 30 days, 3 meals  a day...as he continues seeing his doctors every week.  A couple weeks in the doctors were already telling him he must stop eating the kinds of foods he was eating. We're the fattest country in the world...and damn it...someone has to show who the culprits are.  I'm not going to ruin the movie for you though, but I will tell you that 6 weeks after that movie was shown at Sundance,  Macdonalds yanked the option of "Supersizing" any of their meals.  More recently,  they've introduced the "Go Active" meal...an adult version of the "Happy Meal", which is an attempt to fix a problem they think they are only "a part of"(them and the rest of the fast food  and junk food industry) and a way to keep their pockets filled.  Wait till you see where the chicken nuggets come from people....you have no idea...which reminds me.  I saw a couple picketers in front of a "KFC" today.  They were holding signs about how KFC mistreats their chickens and where they get them and what is in them...etc.  So gross....but was very fitting and comforting to me after seeing that movie last night.  As quoted from the movie..".its up to you...who would you rather see go?  You or them?"  They're not feeling bad about what they are doing to your health ( the people that will have heart conditions, liver failure,diabetesif they keep eating their food)...they're rolling in the big bucks?   Do you think they will stop out of the kindness of their own "healthy"(cause you know they won't eat their own food) heart?  NO!  Until we stop going there..taking our small children there...to get them hooked on that crap.....they will forever be there... like the drug dealers on the corner waiting to give you that first hit.  Wake up!! Ronald Macdonald is not cute....he is not even nice....he is anoying and evil like most clowns, and if Macdonalds portrayed him in the right light you would see that he is actually the  clown from Stephen King's "IT" .   Alright. Enough verbal diarrhea for the night.  I am going to get myself some hot tea and relax with the next toxic thing in this country.....TV.  Thas right...thas what I said.  All I need now is a Big Mac and I'm on my way to being one of the numbers keeping us Detroiters #2 on the obesity scale next to the Supersize me state of Texas!  YEE HA!
