Second, the UK guy, Greg, is out on vacation for two weeks starting today, so the asshole manager over there is calling me because we changed the domain admin passwords about a month ago. Third, the IT Director is taking Vicadin (or however you spell it) for a back injury and he's on the warpath of the mentally challenged.  All I want to do is learn out to install my new blade servers.  Gah.    Anyway, I'm getting over this whole work thing now.  I should be out ther mowing my lawn like my neighbor but I really don't like doing that sort of thing at this time of night.  I am enjoying my new computer desk...IKEA Rocks!...and I'm going to stay here until bed time.  God, what a geek am I?    I am so sore from doing that yoga yesterday and I only did 30 minutes of it.  Geez...imagine what would happen if I did the usual 1.5 hours in the class I was taking before I moved.  Ouch.   I need to go and call my Dad before I forget.  The wine is kicking in and it's not long before bed.  Now if the neighbor can pour some speed on his little legs, the lawn mowing may be done before now.  Same Bat Channel...who knows about the time tomorrow.
