The only problem with sheet protectors is they make the pages stick out far enough in the binder that the tabs on my dividers don't show. I might have to take a trip to Staples and see if I can get some wider dividers. I'm soooo excited about making the Charlotte's Web shawl. (Yeah, I'm catching on to it about a year after every other knitting blogger.) I'm thinking if I can get it done by Russ's Christmas party, I'll wear that over a simple black tank dress. Mmm. I also got a couple patterns from White Lies Designs and a few Berroco books. I enjoy those books because most, if not all the patterns, go up to a size that I can wear (and usually a couple sizes bigger...rock!)  Stash organized. Every single ball of yarn I own is in *something*. And holy shit, there's a lot of it. As soon as I get the Koigu I want for Charlotte, the yarn diet begins.  I'm going to spend the rest of the day swatching for the Shapely Tank with some cotton yarn I got from Elann a while back in a green/blue/white colorway. Spring's finally coming here in Maine, I have to be ready!
