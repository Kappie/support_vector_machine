I would catagorize myself as femme on the streets but butch between the sheets. I come off at first glace as a very conventional femme, but anyone who knows me will tell you that this is just how it appears.  The rest is, surprisingly, more complex  complete. Although the inner machinations of my mind are far from being a COMPETE enigma, I can throw a perfect spiral, and troubleshoot a network.  I can make a Thanksgiving dinner, and edit a PC's registry.  I can decorate my bedroom in pink, but out-drive the average chick at golf.  I'm waiting for all of you  urlLink Annika Sorenstam s to email me. Show me that you can drive your  urlLink Nike Mojo  further than you drive to go on vacation. Does this anwer your question? or does it create more!
