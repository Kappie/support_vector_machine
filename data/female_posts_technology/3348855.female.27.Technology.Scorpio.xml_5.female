Quick now, lightening fast I leap from thought to thought and leaf to leaf to grasp and hold but a chosen few from all those that have gone askew.  This one's interesting, that one's fine no not that one, oh - this one isn't even mine In youthful frivolity I do not mark the stealthy passing of the time.  Why the shock, the surprise, the horror when in a pools broken faded mirror stooped over the forest floor, I see an old old .... old me!
