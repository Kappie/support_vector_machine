I wanted to let everyone know as they are coming back to school that all the junk from me in their mailboxes was no good so they didn't drive themselves crazy trying to figure out what all the hoopla was all about.  I hope that the blog thing proves to be more fun...if nothing else since it is just me and my brain children (not a help desk tool, as such)  maybe some people will get curious and take a peek or even blog with me!  Hope so!   well, am at work at my night job, so will have to get back to it.  Will post again later when I get home (if I can keep my eyes open!)
