Not necessarily EVERY time of course. but I deny nothing that transpires when in the moment. Nothing. Each meditative time of worship and peace is unique, with practice, levels of heightened awareness, and empowerment can be achieved in both the meditative state and during our more mundane daily events.  I initially came into being as a Tantrika under the  guidance of The Lovely and True Goddess *** ****** in Savannah,  Ga in 1989 . Having been initiated into (White) Tantric practices, I was hungry for more knowledge (a seemingly endless hunger with me) I then went to Maui with my Husband (since passed on) and attended two informative and inspiring (to us both) workshops with ** **** (1992). (Red) More recently I have begun to study Bodywork (specifically Reiki and Trigger Point Therapy) with Ms. *** ******** right here in PA.  A well developed Methodologist who has a deft and gentle approach to all of life. I am Based in Pittsburgh , PA and have from time to time been known to "lurk" in The Tantric Temples here on the internet, I admire the more recent ladies that have been posting, and am frankly amazed at the power and the passion they bring to their practice. WOW. I most recently entertained another goddess and a special friend during their (both) initiation into red tantra. Their mutual comfort and attraction made it a bit easier than I forsaw and I was able to leave them to their practice after only a few hours of "hands on" direction. They called me the next day to report their mutual elevation into a blissful meditative trance, and to belie their initial discomfort and skepticism (we all experience skepicism it is only natural and right that as humans we question and even distrust the unknown.... . enough for now....
