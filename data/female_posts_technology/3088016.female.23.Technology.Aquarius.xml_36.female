This is because they claim that the conservatives have captured the media.  ... except, or course, for CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, Hollywood, New York Times, AP...   Now, I would think that if you're going to try to compete with the likes of Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, and Sean Hannity, you'd send out your best and brightest stars, right?  Not exactly  urlLink the plan  for  urlLink Air America  radio.  Al Franken and Jeanine Garofolo are headlining this show.  Their web site touts that "The Right has had its say for the last three years."  It makes me want to cry for them; such a sad story.
