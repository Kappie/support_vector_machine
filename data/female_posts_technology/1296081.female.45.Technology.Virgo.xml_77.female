One of my co-workers was admitted to the hospital yesterday.  He has a blood clot in his leg.  His foot had been hurting and he went into the doctor - luckily.  He is being treated pharmaceutically today and if nothing improves they will get more agressive.  Not sure what that means and I really don't like to think about it.  Surgery is never fun and I do hope that he doesn't have to undergo any.  It makes one worry.  It also gives one time to reflect on how lucky we are to afford health care and to have access to that care.  Can't imagine what it would be like to not have that luxury.....
