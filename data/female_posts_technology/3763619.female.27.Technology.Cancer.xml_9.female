I started thinking about this last week while thinking about my co-worker, John (He is also referred to as my Dad, but that's another story).  John is a devout Republican, yet he spends so much time looking up information about our country's Democratic Candidate, John Kerry.  He is (you guessed it) obsessed.  Everytime I go over to his desk or hear him on the phone, he is spouting off some reason as to why he thinks Kerry is bad.  Now, I am not writing this to get into a political debate.  I just found the whole thing interesting, and it made me think about some of the things that I do.  I react the same way about Britney Spears.  I can give you a million reasons not to listen to her music or see her concerts, yet I always seems to watch her when she's on TV.  It is really funny how that works.  Not funny ha ha, but funny odd.  I wonder why that is.
