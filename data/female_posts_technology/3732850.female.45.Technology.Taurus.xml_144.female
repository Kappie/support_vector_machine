It starts on her grandparentâ€™s farm where her family lives out in a trailer. Both of the little girls would go out and get milk for super everyday. She then describes her father and all the hard work he does for his family. The mother and father cared for each other. At the end they had a picnic and her parents were deeply in love. 	The essay I thought was an illustration essay it gives ideas and pictures of the story. For example, we would have supper on the table and large cool glass of milk setting at each place. The little girls would get the milk from the barn and her father coming to help them with the milk to the house. She also gave realistic images of her parents in the long grass kissing.  	I like to essay. It had a lot of feeling and illustration. It showed that you can use a memory of your past and describe it. I thought was a great writer. What I like the most form this essay is the last paragraph, these memories from my childhood embody everything that I want for my children someday. It shows her feelings for her parents and that she too wants to be a good parent for her children.
