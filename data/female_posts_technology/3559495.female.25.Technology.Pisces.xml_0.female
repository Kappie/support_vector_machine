There's just something about how his eyes look, and that soft voice that makes me feel like floating.  Where is his wife?  I sure as hell didn't want to ask.  My heart and body betrays my logic and reason.  "Get in the car", he said.  I really should have agreed on meeting him somewhere.  In the car, he put his hand on mine.  I didn't notice a ring or a tanline on his ring finger.  I casually glanced over at the hand that was on the steering wheel.  There was nothing in the car that showed evidence of another woman, though he may have hid all that away before picking me up.  I wasn't even sure where we were going.  I could have asked him to just come in, but somehow having him in the privacy of my home might lead into something else.  Believe me when I say that I've imagined hundreds of scenarios while I soaked in my tub.  I noticed there was a cooler in the backseat.  I asked about it.  He said it was part of the surprise.  SURPRISE?  I thought we were going to talk over coffee or something.  I didn't argue it.  I was quite content just having his hand on mine.  It was making me tingle just having him touch my skin.  Damn even his hands were sexy.  They were big soft and warm.  I loved how they covered mine protectively.    He sang along to songs that were playing in the CD player.  He's got a great singing voice.  The man was almost perfect, except for the unavailability part of him.  I had to ask him about it.  I had to ask him about her, if there was a her.  I couldn't find the right timing for it.  He joked about things and told me about how some of the things he and his friends did.  His laugh just warms me inside.  I've fallen for this man hard.    He drove to this field about 20 minutes past the freeway.  There was a mowed section with a picnic table.  He said that his family owned this section of land.  It was very secluded.  The first thing that paced through my mind was that no one would be able to hear me if I screamed and if he planned on murdering me no one could help.  He noticed that I was thinking about something and asked if I was ok.  I told him that I was afraid of snakes.  What a stupid thing to say.  It was a lovely picnic.  I felt like I was living something out of a romance novel.  We talked about things in general, what I wanted to do, if I was planning on remodelling or decorating the house.  I was sitting hugging my knees.  He sat with his legs out and resting on his one arm right up next to me.  He pushed the hair out of my face.  I was feeling extacy from having him that close but with an ache in my heart.    We started in each other's eyes for a long time.  I was getting so lost in those hazel eyes of his.  I caught myself looking at his lips far too often.  He sat up closer to me and I could feel his breath on my cheek.  I wanted so badly to kiss him but I sat still just looking at the grass.  He made the first move and turned my head with his hand and kissed my lips lightly.  I wanted to melt.  His kissing became deeper and more intense.  Just this one thing, I thought to myself.  That's it.  I pulled away and he just looked into my eyes.  He told me I had the most beautiful eyes and that there was something about them that made him want to stare at them forever.  My heart ached so.  I had to say something.  I couldn't do this.  It wasn't fair.  I simply said 'I know about her.  We can just be friends.  Would it be ok if you just took me home?'  There was a look of pain in his eyes and he nodded packed up and we rode in silence back to my house.  I sat on my back porch and cried.
