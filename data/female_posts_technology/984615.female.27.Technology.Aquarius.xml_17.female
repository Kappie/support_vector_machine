HA!  urlLink Winona   is guilty - but aint goin NOWHERE! Time in jail? Pshaw. not gonna happen in this universe where the bad guy gets time off for good behavior even when they've been convicted of murder. Besides she's too pretty to have anything happen. Hmph. shes a neighbor too - from the 'burbs - serves her right.
