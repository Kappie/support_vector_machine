Don't get me wrong, I love the other Iraqi bloggers and read them on a regular basis.  urlLink Riverbend  expresses herself with such eloquence and precision that she puts most native English speakers to shame. Zeyad from  urlLink Healing Iraq , keeps dazzling us with his sharp intellect and most substantial posts. The brothers from  urlLink Iraq the Model  keep it real by reporting what is going on in real life on the ground and I love it when they post pictures. And many many more.   Salam wasn't the most eloquent, his pictures where ok and lets just say the substantial part was a bit thin on his blog. But he had tons of characters and he was funny. His blog had what I would call "Shwing". Shwing are the things in life that make you want to say barabeembaraboom. They are hard to put your finger on but you know shwing when you see it. Salam has tons of it.  So, here is my plan to get Salam to blog again. I suggest that we start a blog and call it "Where is Salam?". On this blog we will report the most ridiculous conspiracy theories about where Salam is. For example:  Salam abducted by aliens, proof found. Salam spotted in Nebraska, panhandling on the streets. Pictures of Salam shaking hands with Elvis Presley found in elderly women's attic.  If the theories get too ridiculous, Salam would be forced to resurface just to stop the rumors. What do you think?
