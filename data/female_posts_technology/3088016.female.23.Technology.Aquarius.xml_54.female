It's actually only half that - it's also a "Wayne has these free tickets that are about to expire" trip.  Still, I'm excited.  I've been told that the museums are great, and the Sears Tower is a must-do.  If you've ever been to Chicago and have suggestions for what to see and do or where to stay, let me know.  urlLink     Credit for this picture belongs to  urlLink TerraGalleria.com .
