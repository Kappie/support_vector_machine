It started with a very small subteam, who then invited a slightly larger subteam, and then in order to be fair, the Project Engineer invited a significantly larger subteam and the PM decided to pay for it.  It works for me, because I got to go and still got paid for the day.  I did hear that there was a little bit of chatter of people feeling left out, and I can understand why the if you invite everyone but four people (in a department of about 40) that could happen.  It was strange, actually, that we got to do this at all.  A throwback to the days almost three years ago when I first joined the company and times were good.  Money was everywhere, and projects were struggling to spend it.  One project that I was on had regular monthly paid happy hours at the Fox  Hound, and all had the "unofficial" after-party.  This wasn't quite so frivolous, as we still paid for our own food and drinks, but it was a nice day for baseball and we won the game.     urlLink Kelly , the resident photographer, left to go take a bunch of pictures around the stadium.  He came back and reported that there were two guys smoking pot up in the belltower.  I'm surprised they could get away with that when I had my purse searched and was almost padded down, but that's the way things go.   The most interesting part didn't happen during the game.  At least, not for me.  Several (about 4-5) of our co-workers, the Boys' Club I sometimes go to lunch with, had purchased seats at a higher location.  When they came down to meet everyone else, there had been hours of beer pouring in, so they were a lot of fun.  We resolved to meet at the Flying Saucer after the game, and the after-party began.  I learned that drunkenness is more fun when you're sober, or at least closer to it than everyone else.  When Kelly gets the pictures posted, I'll link to them here.   The  urlLink Saucer  is a great place for a happy hour or to bring a group.  They have a tap selection that spans a very long wall, offering 85 different beers.  There are hundreds more on tap.  Two in our party were U.F.O. club members and printed out how many they had left to drink of the 200 unique beers required to get one's name on a 'saucer' on the ceiling.  One guy sitting on the bar had done so at least a dozen times and had plates bearing his name all over the wall.  It would take me 10 years to do it once.  We played darts, at which I'm terrible, for hours until my boyfriend showed up.  Then, I actually started hitting the board a couple of times.  It was sad that people who'd consumed gallons of beer and the one who's legally blind completely kicked my sober butt at darts.  Wayne won one of the money rounds, which basically made up for the expensive parking downtown.    Our next stop was Bossa, where we drank some kind of Brazilian drink that comes with a sugar cane and was reported to be so strong we couldn't drink two.  I never did feel it.  We kept trying to get the waitress to tell our friend she loved his Seersucker shirt, but she wouldn't do it.  I honestly don't think she knew what that was.  Wayne and I soon departed the group and finished with a nice sidewalk dinner at an Italian restaurant we have been to and loved.  Eating at this point is STILL tricky (it's been 8 days since the surgery!) so I had to cut my linguine and shrimp into teeny tiny pieces in order to eat them and manage only to chew with my front chompers.  It took me forever to eat a tiny portion, and I think I forgot and left the doggie bag on the table.  On the way back to the car, we were approached by a bum.  I guess that with as many as there are downtown, we're lucky it's just one.    All in all, a fun night.  Tonight is not so fun.  I'm supposed to be working on a part of my final paper for class (yay!) and then get some rest hopefully early.  In case you start to think I have no life, Wayne and I are going to the  urlLink Art Car Parade  tomorrow.  Now aren't we exciting?
