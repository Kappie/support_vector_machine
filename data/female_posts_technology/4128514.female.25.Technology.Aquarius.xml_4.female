Kinda hard to have a bad convo with a 4 year old though.  Anyway, the ex actually asked to speak to me!  He hasn't had more than 2 words for me since I moved the boy back home with me last weekend.  Boy was I shocked!  I didn't expect much more than the basics for months  (if that much at all) , the way he carried on about me "taking the boy from him".  It wasn't about  "taking him";  it was, as it has always been, putting  the boy's  best interests above and beyond our own.  We can't always be his "friend" and his "parent" at the same time.  I don't think the ex ever caught onto that in the 5 months the boy was living there.  I never wanted to hurt the ex's feelings, depsite his cursings on me.  I have forgiven and moved along from that chapter in my life, and getting back at him wouldn't serve me any purpose...especially trying to use the boy to do it...that's just   trifling  .  Anyway, it was  almost  nice to have a respectable convo, without the hostility.  Now he  "said"  he's gonna get the boy this weekend so he can visit with his baby sister and step brother...let's see if he carries that one out.
