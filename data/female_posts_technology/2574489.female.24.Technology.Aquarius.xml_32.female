There's muscles now being unearthed by all the twisting and sweating and jumping and running and bending and crunching.....NOT!  I wish losing weight was a progress that matched the speed of gaining it.  But, alas, good things are always harder to achieve, you sometimes have to sweat for them, for pete's sake.    But I am determined.  Now, I can hear my husband and Rhy saying we've heard this before, right before I jab an elbow in their faces anyway ;-), but trust me, this time its different.  This time, I'm looking at a small pouch resting in my belly area, and it ain't a fanny pack. My emergency plan includes cutting on carbs, which means our brand-new Tiger rice cooker has been sitting empty on our kitchen counter for a week.  Carbs is my friend.  It's my favorite thing.  I like it better than sweets.  Once, for Lent, I elected to give up rice and couldn't last--sorry Lord--and defected about 10 days before Lent was over. So you'd think it would be torture for me to give up rice now.  But my desperation is reaching critical level.  I must get fit.  Not just to lose weight but to establish a lifelong habit.    So last night, even though I was dead sleepy from working my 2-10:30 p shift, I cranked up the music and worked out to the music of Patricia Montalero, a Hispanic artist, and her very infectious song, Que El Ritmo No Pare...which, Woody assures me, translates into The Rhythm Never Stops.  I hope my rythm never stops either. -
