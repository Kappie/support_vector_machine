I sort of pulled a muscle in my right palm…anyways got dressed and drove to work ..made a quick stop to get coffee and a muffin… turned on computer…and checked voicemails ..while I was checking emails ..my director walked by and simple said “ HI KRIS!” in turn I squealed “OH NO…TONY … BUG”… “WANT A TISSUE”.. tony attempted to entrap this enormous size cockroach off my desk however missed and it quickly dashed behind my desk.. I don’t know if u ever had something as enormous as a tyrannosaurus rex on your desk but I just did ..i mean it had like 5 creepy legs ..one must have broke off or he must have been a mutated bug with an extra leg… due to all the rat poison its mom must have ingested while she was pregnant. So currently I type in fear that this bug might jump up from behind ma desk and bloody devour my left hand pinky finger which lays freakishly on the letter “A” on ma keyboard…I however find it a bit unusual that a huge squeaky clean biosphere-like cooperate building where the men dress like they just stepped off of the set of “Men In Black” which houses thousands of cooperate zombies that work on the say of Alan Greenspan’s economic advices would allow a freaking tyrannosaurus rex like cockroach running around like a little ant in their safe haven…I should have wore my boots it probably gonna crawl up my freshly ironed GAP kaki’s with satin lined pockets… and viciously nibble on the natural wrinkles of my tender knee…with its razor sharp incisor teeth.. ahhh…gotta stop writing I’m bloody freaking out…IT’S GONNA EAT ME….    Question of the Day…   What kind of bug are u most afraid of…?
