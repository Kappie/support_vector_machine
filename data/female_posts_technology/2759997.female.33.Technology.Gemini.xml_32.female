There's still not a lot of information on the site, but the kick-off party is this Thursday at Jackson's 5:30 - 7:30.  Stop by and donate $5 to the cause and enjoy happy hour!  Or, purchase your $15 ticket for the big event while you're there and save the $5.  Daisy, let me know if I missed anything...
