My current blog will be split into 3:  A Day In My iLife - My personal journal of events happening in my life.  This will also contain thoughts on computer stuff and that sort of thing.  The Daily Tea Biscuit - An eclectic collection of tea reviews, short stories that go well with tea, interesting news articles, and other things relevant to the tea drinker's lifestyle.  And finally, The Munchkin Review - (This is named as such because I am so short).  I plan to review the movies I watch from my Netflix queue as well as dissect popular movies currently in the theater.  As I get everything together, I will put up the links to the new bloglets.  -- Aeryth
