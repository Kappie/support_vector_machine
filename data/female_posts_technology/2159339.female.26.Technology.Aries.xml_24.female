I never had the pleasure of meeting Michelle, but judging by the photographs scattered around the room and from all the things that people said, I'm sure she was just as funny, effervescent and lovely as Genny, who is one of the most amazing people I have ever met.  The drive to the delta, where it took place, took almost two hours each way and by the time we got back to the city, the sun was setting and it was too late to do anything outside. M went home to take a nap and I went to Marcus' to pick up the keys to his apartment, which I'm housesitting while he goes east for the holiday. Visiting Marcus is never as simple as picking up keys. Once I'm in, I better have a few hours to spare because he sure likes to chat. Marcus is an advice-dispensing machine (in a good way) and I'm a sponge that sits on the kitchen chair with my feet folded under me, trying to absorb everything he says and coming up with something half as clever in return, which is tough. He doesn't have any plants or pets, but insisted that I experience San Francisco from his apartment, which is perched on top of a hill next to Coit Tower. I told him that I'll try to enjoy the view from the kitchen window, which overlooks the bay. So this means that I can walk to my temporary home from work today.   Batty, you HAVE to visit this place. BTW, I didn't see you on the seven oh seven. I even looked back to see if you're running for the bus, but you weren't. Unless you morphed into that pudgy russian woman, in which case we did, in fact, ride the bus together this morning.
