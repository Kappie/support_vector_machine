Often times we choose to ignore them-pretending that they do not exist because their arguments are too heavy and difficult to deal with. We pretend that everything is alright and drown them in alcohol, drugs or whatever poison you choose. But in one way or the other they manifest themselves in different ways that other people can see except you. And you wonder why people react the way they do towards you, do the things you do and that you can’t seem to get what you want and truly deserve. Sometimes the most difficult person to see is yourself. Blinded by denial, self-pity, anger and fear, we can’t accept our own faults because it hurts too much to face them and that we have no clue on how to deal. We think it’s easier to turn our backs, unaware that we are sinking deeper into the black hole that we created for ourselves. And we slowly but so surely hate ourselves-letting self-loathing consume us. The light within us that once provided warmth and comfort is starting to fade. We become lost. So we start on the path towards self-destruction. We figure that if we didn’t care-things would be easier. If we numb ourselves enough-nothing can ever hurt us, thus becoming untouchable-or so we thought. We unintentionally or intentionally isolate ourselves and we then experience unbearable loneliness.  Concerned friends and family may tell you things that you refuse to hear because people, more often than not, do not like to be criticized. We can be very stubborn sometimes and we would rather be on the right than on the wrong. Also, no one else knows ourselves better than we do so why should we listen? Listen, because sometimes they actually know better. As much as I hate to admit it, they can actually see things better because they are not as emotionally involved the way we are. It doesn't necessarily mean though, that they are always right. Only we can truly know what is right for ourselves. We can always listen, weigh their reasoning and choose to either heed their advice or not. Emotions can cloud judgment and it’s the alarm that triggers our defense mechanism. And once they’re up, they become a barrier that no one can ever break down. The voice ofour demons drown the advice of our friends.   No one can ever help us except ourselves. It’s a struggle to rid the demons we ourselves created. It’s a choice on whether we choose to remain in pain and denial or to acknowledge our faults and decide to change. It’s not an easy process and we always run the risk of falling back into our old ways. Still, no matter how many times we stumble and fall, we must hold on to the belief that we can be better, we deserve a better life and that we can in fact, be happy. If we believe something strongly enough, it can come true.
