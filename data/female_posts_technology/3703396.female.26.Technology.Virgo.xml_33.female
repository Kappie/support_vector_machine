Friday morning we got up early and drove into Burbank, where we waited in line to see The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (much more on that later).     After seeing the taping, we checked into the Hilton at Universal City. The gentleman at the front desk was nice enough to provide us with a complimentary room upgrade to the Executive level on the 20th floor.      Notice the seriously awesome view of the Hills.  The staff was very nice to us for our entire stay, and exceeded our expectations for sure! The hotel had a modeling conference going on, which Amy and I both thought was probably a scam to these 10,000 people hoping to 'make it big' in Hollywood. I hope something good came out of it for the participants.  We took a quick swim and ordered room service, then watched the opening of the Olympics and I stayed up long enough to watch us fly by on three zoom pans across the opening sequence of The Tonight Show! *lol*  Saturday we went to the Universal Citywalk for some souvenir shopping. We at at the Saddle Ranch Steakhouse for breakfast, where our very cute waiter sang Happy Birthday to Amy and gave her a free Slab of Chocolate cake.     Then it was off to the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County to see the gem exhibit. First we stopped in the Pavilion of Wings to see the butterflies, which were beautiful as expected!     Here Amy is holding a caterpillar that one of the keepers was telling her about. Isn't it cute?     The gem collection is quite a sight - thousands and thousands of minerals and gems are on display. It is one of the biggest collections I have ever seen, and Amy sure seemed to like it too. I bored Amy by taking a million pictures, but I think she was happy cuz she got to see 'shiny stuff'. =)     Next we stopped off to see the infamous Hollywood Sign. You'd think it is prominent and can be seen from everywhere, but it is quite difficult to find. This picture was taken from the top of Beachwood. We had to illegally park in a red zone with our emergency flashers on long enough to take a shot (this is with a 300mm zoom lens, no tripod). Lots of other tourists were doing the same thing we were. I'd hate to live on Beachwood!     For Saturday night we watched television, napped, and talked until the wee hours of the morning. Sunday we got up around 8am and took off for Phoenix. We stopped at the outlet mall that is 100 miles east of LA, 50 miles west of Indio, for some shopping. We picked up more souvenirs and were off to home sweet home!  I'd like to thank Amy again for joining me in California for her birthday. I think we had a fantastic time!
