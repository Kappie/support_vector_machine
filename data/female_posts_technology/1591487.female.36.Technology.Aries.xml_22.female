I feel the baking urge coming on, so I feel there'll be a bit of that happening, I have a scarf to finish tonight for gift-giving tomorrow. I don't know about this knitting to a deadline deal - it takes the meditative qualities out of the equation, but it's my own fault, so I can help myself.  However the big project is the wardrobe-cleansing project this weekend.  I'm feeling slightly anxious about it because inevitably I have a hard time parting with some clothes.  And there's the whole discovering the ones with the labels still on them, and the ones I've forgotten about because I had to hide them from disapproving eyes when returning home with yet more shopping bags.  There's also the 'I'm sure I'll find something to wear with that', or the 'one day I'll fit into that' or the "surely, that will come back into fashion" lot of clothes.    But this time I'm planning to put my ruthless hat on and go zen on that wardrobe's ass.  There's no room left and I can't keep hanging clothes on door handles and have them go crashing in the middle of the night scaring the hell out of me.  Surely organised people don't live this way.  And really, when I am going to wear a yellow plastic raincoat again?
