She hurriedly rushes in, does her thing, and then rushes out, not giving the sinks a second glance.    To put this in perspective, we work at a place that is so safety conscious that there are signs in every stall saying "Employees must wash hands before returing to work."  No, we're not at a restaurant, but someone recognized that this is important for all types of work, and put up the signs.  I may be extreme with restroom sanitation; I don't touch faucets or door handles without a paper towel in hand, etc.  I still don't think it's too much to ask for someone to wash up.   One of my co-workers tells a funny story about this same situation at his previous job.  He actually followed the guy out of the restroom and caught up with him around the corner.  "Can I ask you for a favor?," he asks.  "Sure," replies the guy, putting his filthy arm around my colleague.  "Would you mind washing your hands next time?"  The guy apparently seemed caught off guard and agreed to do so, but then turned around about ten steps later and said "No!  No I won't!"  What's the harm?  If anyone has any arguments against hand washing, I'd like to hear them, so email me and I'll post them here.         So, consider this post a public service announcement.  The Health Department should pay me for this.
