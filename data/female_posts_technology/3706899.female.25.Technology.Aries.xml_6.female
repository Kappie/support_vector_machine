I don't know how you got this result, but what the hell...  Enjoy your title, and try selling some of your "unvented" patterns- you may make enough for that bundle of qiviut you've been drooling over...    urlLink   Are you a knitter?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    OMG, not a chance...I just started knitting just before spring break.  Though I used to make all these swatches of lacy patterns in dishcloth cotton I found in my mom's cedar chest when I was a kid.  So I know how to do all that stuff...I just never actually MADE anything before spring break.    You are interchangeable. Fun, free, and into everything, you've got every eventuality covered and every opportunity just has to be taken. Every fiber is wonderful, and every day is a new beginning. You are good at so many things, it's amazing, but you can easily lose your place and forget to show up. They have row counters for people like you!    urlLink   What kind of knitting needles are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Well, I have been wanting to try those...but I have too many sets of regular needles to justify the cost.
