One of the category is Best Asian Weblog, and one of the contender is  urlLink A Sassy Lawyer in Philippine Suburbia .  I checked out the site.  I'm too stupid for it.  But it's very good. I'm having a great time discovering new blogs.    Recent Accomplishments: -studied  -worked out (yay for me!) -returned items that needed to be returned -bought items needed to be bought  Yesterday was such a nice sleep-in, stretch in bed day.  I woke up around 11:30 am and cooked brunch for husband.  He loved my eggs and bacon.  He sent me a love e-mail during the day which was very sweet.  At the end of it all, I joked that I would love to be a house-wife.  Well, half-joked.  I did like it very much.  Liked it so much it made waking up early today for work much harder. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Something fun for everyone.  Credit to our cousin Shei for teaching us this.  Whenever you get a fortune cookie at Asian/Chinese restaurants, try adding the line "in bed" at the end of it.  Some examples of average fortune cookie turned funny.  To be loved you must be loving... in bed  You will have many adventures... in bed  And if you didn't see Rhy's message on tag board: It's impossible to please everybody...please yourself first.... in bed !
