Suddenly, he trips and feels a sharp pain. He screams, "Ahhhhhh!" Surprised, he hears a voice coming from the mountain, "Ahhhhh!"   Filled with curiosity, he screams, "Who are you?" But the only answer he receives is, "Who are you?"   This makes him angry, so he screams, "You are a coward!" and the voice answers, "You are a coward!"  He looks at his father, asking, "Dad, what is going on?"  "Son," the man replies, "pay attention!" Then he screams, "I admire you!" The voice answers, "I admire you!"  The father shouts, "You are wonderful!" and the voice answers, "You are wonderful!"  The boy is surprised, but still can't understand what is going on.  The the father explains,   "People call this an 'echo' but truly it is 'life!'   Life always gives you back what you give out. Life is a mirror of your actions.   If you want more love, give more love. If you want more kindness, give more kindness. If you want understanding and respect, give understanding and respect. If you want people to be patient and respectful to you, give patience and respect. This rule of nature applies to every aspect of our lives."   Life always give you back what you give out. Your life is not a coincidence, but a mirror of your own doings.
