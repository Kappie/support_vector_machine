John's been busy going out with a friend to apply for work.  I bought two shirts last Tuesday.  It was on impulse and I remembered him saying na wala na syang shirt.  Lalabhan pa kasi.  What's going on over there?  John's current favorite music is from the band Me First and the Gimmie Gimmies.  They do rock versions of old and new songs.  Thank you sa remittance.  Never mind the birthday thing.  Send me a card =).  Love you!
