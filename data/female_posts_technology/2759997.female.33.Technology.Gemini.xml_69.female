Peach's Z hadn't been broken in yet, so we road-tripped it to Tunica last night, where I quickly showed her how easy it is to lose money in the casino.  But we had fun and befriended a bartender (imagine that...) and are willing to make another donation to the casino gods later today.  Then on to Memphis to the Pyramid to go to the "Wonders" exhibit.  We're so cultured, we may turn into yogurt.  ;)
