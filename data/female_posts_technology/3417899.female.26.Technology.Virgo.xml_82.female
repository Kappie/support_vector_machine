My friend and I have been caught, and tomorrow we will be sent to the Jewish camps. The night is falling, and our fear is growing. I am begging my best friend, Claudia, to save my friend and I. Begging her to hide us.  Claudia says she can't help us. I see sorrow in her eyes, but nothing in her words backs it up.  Tomorrow we will be sent to the Jewish camp.    Scene 2: Conversion kit  It's morning, and my friend and I are on the banks of the river, about to be sent away on a boat. Claudia appears, running.  "I'm going to save you!", she says. My heart stops.  She takes out a kit. A "conversion kit" of sorts. All you have to do is covert. Here's the kit. You'll be safe.  "I can't" I say. "But, Ady, it's your only way!?"... "I can't".    Scene 3 Sent on the river  My friend and I are in a small rubber boat. Our hands are tied with little plastic ropes to the boat and to each other. People wave us off, and the boat is carried on the fast stream and into a building. The river flows through the corridors of the building. There's a damp smell in the air.  We manage to wiggle out of the plastic restraints and off the boat into the water. We tumble with the stream holding on to each other.    Scene 4:  The storage closet  There's a small door in the cement wall - we swim towards it. Climb in. It's a small, dark storage closet of sorts. There are brooms and cleaning supplies and very little room for the both of us. We sit it the closet trying to catch our breath.  My friend takes out her cell phone and calls her parents, to let them know she is OK. As she speaks, we hear footsteps. Somebody is approaching the closet. I hush my friend and slam her phone shut.  The door to the closet opens a crack and a large hand is seen. It retrieves a can from the closet, and does not see us.  We are safe for now.    Scene 5: The lady in the parking lot   There a tiny crack in the closet wall. I peer outside through the crack and see a parking lot. We are located between two levels of the parking lot, but not to high to jump out.  Every now and then somebody walks through and gets in the car, and drives away. They don't notice us or the crack.  An elegant lady is speaking to a fine looking man. They shake hands and he climbs in the car.  She walks towards the crack in the wall, towards us. She seems kind and is smiling.   "I can help you" she whispers to us. "Do you need a bed to sleep in and hide tonight?" We nod, and she helps us climb down and into the parking lot. She seems kind.    Scene 6: Cheese to sugar  "I will need Jewish foods", she says. "Did you see any in the closet"?  We nod, "There was some Jewish cheese in there", I say. "Great", she replies. "Climb up and get it. I will use it to make brown sugar".  I go up and get it for her.  "Great, follow me.", she motions. We start walking.    Scene 7: The people in the woods  We follow her to the woods. My friend is told to wait behind.   As I follow the kind lady, we arrive at a clearing in the woods. There's an area for cooking, and a large are for picnicing. I look around and suddenly notice dozens of people.  They are tied to the tables and chairs, to each other, to the trees. Their faces are streaked with tears. Their clothes torn. Some are bloodied. All have terrified looks on their faces.  A bolt of realizations shoot through me.  The lady looks back at me and says "I had to tie them, for their own good. It's the only way to educate them".  I nod and keep walking.  I look back at the people. Many of them are rubbing their hands together frantically. Rubbing, rubbing.   "Um..." I say. "Can I go wash my hands before we eat"?  "Sure", She replies. "The sinks are right over there, behind those trees.". I start walking towards the trees. And then I start running. Running. Running. Running!!!! Running!!!!    It's been four days since this dream and I still remember it vividly (The only other dream I remember this vividly is one I used to dream in kindergarten, over and over, every night for several months. I will have to write it here some other day)...
