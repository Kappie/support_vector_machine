There were 140 young adults--mostly singles, a handful of couples--from  all  over Houston at St. Cyrils Church on Monday night.   Won't you join us this week for the next episode of CAFE CATHOLICA? It  will surely be engaging as Fr. Michael Barrett speaks to us about dating  and sex. He will then take questions from the floor.   Newcomers are welcome to join our carpool from St. Bernadette church  this  Monday, July 19th. We'll meet near the playground between 5:30 and 5:45.  We'll leave at 5:45 sharp. You can call or email me if you plan to come so  we'll be looking out for you.   Mass begins at 6:30 and will be celebrated especially for us by Bishop  Joe  Vasquez.   7:00 Music and Food   7:30-9:00 Fr. Michael Barrett "Bachelors and Bachelorettes" - dating  and sex   If you'll be meeting us at St. Cyrils (10501 Westheimer Rd @ beltway  8),  I'm looking for someone willing to take 2-3 passengers back to the carpool  site at St. B's after the event. Please call or email me if you'd be  willing and able.   There is a $5 suggested donation per night.  In past years, this has been a very popular topic.  Hope you can join us!  Call me for more information at 281 488-0251 or, on Monday at 281  455-1141  cel   God bless,  Donna D.
