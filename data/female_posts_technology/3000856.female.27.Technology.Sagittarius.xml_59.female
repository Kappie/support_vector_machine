Even though I say I don't want any more kids I have changed my mind.  I don't think I want to give birth again, but I think I want to become a foster parent and adopt eventually too. Not now, probably in like 5 yrs or so. I have way to much going on and it would not be fair to Collen or that child at this point. It just amazes me what children go through and how durable they are. Nobody asks to be born and it is not their fault that they are abused or abandoned and it is about time that I try and help make a difference in some of these kids lives even if it's only a few, I want to know that I did make a difference in those few lives!
