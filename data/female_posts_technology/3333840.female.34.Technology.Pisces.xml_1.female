It's getting to the point that they're losing our business. However, my supervisor who is hardly ever in the office or deals with these people just got invited out to Joseph's for lunch. This has to be the best place I've ever eaten and the only place where I can actually eat seafood from! How dare they not invite me?! Plus, it was my supervisor's day to buy my lunch (we take turns buying for one another). To make matters worse, a coworker and I went to Joseph's "DUTCH" for my birthday. Since I never carry cash, I put the bill on my VISA, which was a total of $150. I have yet to receive her $75.00. For those of you who don't know, my birthday is in March!  In other news I was offered a $10 per hour raise. Yes, it does come out to $400 per week which is an excellent amount of money if: 1) I didn't wait over 16 months for this raise and if 2) My position wasn't about to terminate! However, I am very thankful for having a job of any kind at this point. Especially, one as flexible and satisfying as this one.
