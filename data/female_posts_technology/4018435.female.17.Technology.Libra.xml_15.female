Then the phone rand and I closed it out since I was still asleep to a vertain degree. It was josh and we booked to meet up tonight. We were supposed to go to elements but I couldn't go cuz my family had planned on going to toronto to meet up with my aunt and to go out for dinner. Mom and dad, of course, suggested that i should ask josh to come along. I did ask him and it felt really akward, but later he called me back with an answer...he said he could come with us. I was really surprised but yes, happy in every way. Of course the only thing on my mind about the situation was "my family is gonna scare him away" but honestly, i couldn't believe what I saw! He talked as if he knew them, he was friendly, he smiled and he openly understood everything around him! I was purely amazed. Wow, guess that adds on to reasons why I think he's cute! He'll be going to New York for a week tomorrow. I'm hoping to get together with him again to see Collateral starring Tom Cruise when he gets back.         Earlier i started taking apart my room again. This time I took apart the damn bed. I figured if I took the bed apart, I'd be forcing myself to clear everything on the floor and couldn't possibly hide everything everywhere. I'm not working tomorrow, meaning I'll be able to finally get this place emptied so I can paint it and get my furniture at last!         I emailed shawn today and told him everything that was going on lately. He left me a message on my computer and I had a huge smile on my face when i read it. I'm so glad he wrote back! I miss my best friend...Yep! See! here's proof! I'm writing about you in my journal shawny! I can't possibly forget u! Hahaha!         I really really really should be getting to sleep...but the problem is...I have no bed! Ha! Guess I'll go sleep on the couch! Nighty nighters!
