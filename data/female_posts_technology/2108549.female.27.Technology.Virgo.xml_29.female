That I must be in some constant state of need or crisis for the friendship to continue.  What I am learning though is that the longer I am sober, the less crisis and need I have.  And what has happened is there have been times that I have needed to generate some crisis for fear of losing that friendship.  That doesn't need to happen anymore.  Through events in the last few weeks, the number of friendships I have is dwindling.  When I first realized this I was almost panicked.  "What's wrong with me?" and after more thinking and writing, I realized, maybe the unhealthy friendship have to go so that I can focus on the few healthy ones I have and begin other healthy friendships.    I don't think any relationship can ultimately last when it is based on need.  I think it has to be a relationship built on commonalities, and care and concern for one's well being without having to fill the need to control the other person.  More often than not, I have allowed myself to be controlled and while I didn't like it, fear of rejection or having to stand alone kept me from stopping that control.  Its something I don't want in my life and I guess identifying the problem is the first step.
