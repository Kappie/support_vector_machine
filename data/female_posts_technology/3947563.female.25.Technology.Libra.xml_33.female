I stand 5'9", and weigh 180 lbs.I would eventually like to get down to 165 - a weight I haven't seen since I was about 16. I am currently only 21, haha. I don't have any lofty ambitions of being a size 6 or anything, since, when I was a skinny-as-a-rake 14 year old, I was wearing a ladies size 8. I have a big frame, and underneath my protective coat of flab, a lot of muscle. (Seriously!) I currently wear between size 13 and size 15.    Here are my current measurements:  Waist: 36"  Hips: 43.5"  Ribs: 34.5"  Tatas: 39"  Thighs: 26" (EACH!!)  Upper Arms: 13"    I intend to take off 5-7 lbs this month, and hopefully 1-2 inches around my waist. My plan includes a low calorie diet, (including SlimFast because I'm lazy,) and LOTS of working out - 5 times a week for at least half anhour. Three times a week hasn't been doingas much as I'd like. I don't want to cut carbs, but I do intend to cut sugar out almost completely.    My workouts will include pilates, swimming, walking, biking, rollerblading, softball (if that counts,) and excessive groaning.    I'm not looking forward to this,but here goes...something!
