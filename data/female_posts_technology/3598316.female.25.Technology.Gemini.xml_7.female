       
      25 tomorrow, my life is over as I know it.  Don, you are right, I am fired from life. Can I leave now? Well, I will wait until I have had Japanese Village tonight and driven my new car at least 100 KM. And I have nothing else to say, oh exept, Fergy bear.....sorry no new pictures today my friend!
