Don’t get me wrong, I had my friends and a good share of men in my life while I was in college…It’s just that now when I look back at it … I don’t think I enjoyed it…I mean in college it was all at my disposal … I lived on campus, didn’t have mom and dad breathing down my back… the guy girl ratio was 14 to 1… I mean hello 14 guys to every girl ..yah it was nice… I feel as if I cheated myself … early on during my freshmen and sophomore years I tended to date cuz.. hey he was hot… had a nice smile ..gorgeous hair.. I know I was extremely shady.. but I’m sure those guys only dated me cuz of my physical characteristics … Which I do not pose anymore .. and have lost hope of posing … I mean size 4 jeans … I’d be glad if I can stick one butt cheek into that now.. I mean I guess I was pretty popular in college I once had a friend tell me “every girl wants to be you and every guy wants to nail you” .. I laughed it off…whatever .. We were so immature back then… In college everything was about …who slept with who, and what the hottest club was, and how much lick can one hold with out totally vomiting .. And high school was about ice cream parlors and roller skating rings and who had their 1st kiss with who… I guess once you through with college and start working u loose your sense of havin fun..i mean I think I did .. now life is about when I can make time to do laundry, or vacuum, or take the car for an oil change …  I noticed I need to make an effort just to keep in touch with friends I mean in high school and college I took them for granted … They were always there… Currently .. lets just say all my friends have lives and I ..well I think doing laundry on a weekday rather then the traditional weekend is mucho exciting… Yah .. I truly need a MAN … I don’t know when I hit rock bottom … I mean in college there was always a guy… hell I had backups… now…it become so hard .. I assume it cuz ..back then I dated to have a good time… go out to dinner, go dancing and then I’d go back to my place and he’d go back to his place and we’d call it a night… there was no real pressure.. NOW!!!..u got mom breathing down your back stating that you need to get married .. and grandma constantly b*itchin… informing me that I’m goin to be 24 soon and that I’m still stupidly single.. I guess now I’m not looking for a boyfriend anymore but rather a HUSBAND…I know sounds scary..but hey I have an excuse … I’m single cuz I’m out lookin for a man who’s marriage material…this sucks …think I’m goin to go back to my tea it's 9:06 and i'm here till 4:30 ish..gonna be a long *ss day… talk to ya all tomorrow…   Something to Think About: I like my coffee black but drink my tea with cream and sugar…isn’t that a bit odd… Wonder if that hot guy from the sister company is around today…he did have a cute butt…OK I admit I’m a butt girl .. I think a man’s butt has a lot to say about him…yup…nice butt…sweet…
