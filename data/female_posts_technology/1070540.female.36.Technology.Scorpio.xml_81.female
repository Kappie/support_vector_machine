They have got to know that I love them. I am not saying be their friend, but to show them that I still care for them and that I love them still. These last few years have not been easy on them and they have told me that sometimes they feel like outsiders no matter where they are at. I dont want that at all.    My family is the most important "thing" in my life and I dont want to loose any part of it.
