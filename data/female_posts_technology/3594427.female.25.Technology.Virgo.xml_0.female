I just tell them that I chose to be single because a boyfriend does not fit in my plans right now. It’s partly true because I have no idea yet where I want to settle down for at least 5 years. Since I am definitely leaving Singapore in late 2005, then it would just complicate matters if I got involved with anyone here. However, the real reason I choose to be single is that I am waiting for the right person to come along.   I’ve had a number of failed relationships, disastrous dates and really weird pseudo-boyfriends. I’ve practically met all the possible freaks of nature. You name your worst nightmare, I’ve probably gone out with him. I might have had 2 gay ex- boyfriends (I say might because I am still in denial about the other one.), an affair with a low-life two-timing scumbag, a long painful quasi-arrangement with a pseudo-date (don’t ask me to explain that one), and many other disasters too insignificant to mention.  Now if I didn’t learn anything from my experiences, then none of these would have been worth it. But in a way, everything I’ve been through has helped both me and my friends.  I am able to give good advice because most of it is based on first-hand experience. At the same time, it has helped me define clearly what I really want in a man.  So here is my long, complicated wish list of what I am looking for in a guy:  1)	Smart but has a life- I want a guy who can talk to me about anything under the sun and be able to contribute significantly to the conversation. But I don’t want someone who will be hunched over his computer or a book all the time. He still should know how to have fun and not take himself too seriously.  2)	Confident but not arrogant- I want someone who can get out there and talk to anyone. However, he should not be the sort of guy who would look down on others just because they don’t have the same background.  3)	Cute and good skin- It doesn’t matter if he has dark or fair skin but CLEAR skin is a must. I don’t want someone who is too tall or too fat or too muscular. I want someone who I can easily hug anytime without having to tiptoe.  4)	Streetsmart but not ruthless- I’ve had enough of ruthless men! I want someone who won’t easily be pushed around, but I need someone with a clear set of moral principles.  5)	Sensitive but strong- I don’t mind a guy who cries once in a while. I don’t even mind having the stronger personality in a relationship, but I need somebody who won’t be dependent on me for his well-being. At the same time, I need someone who can be my anchor when I am down.  6)	Flexible, well-rounded, and spontaneous- I need someone who won’t mind being impulsive sometimes. I need someone who can adjust to changes in plans and won’t make such a big useless fuss out of it. He should also be able to mix with different types of people.  7)	Great with kids and pets- I could never go out with someone who could be cruel to cats or any other kind of pet. It also says a lot about a guy’s character when he knows how to deal with kids. He would probably be able to deal with me since I can be one spoiled kid on a bad day.  8)	Independent and Open-minded- I could never go out with a homophobic man since most of my friends are gay. I could never go out with a man who thinks women should just stay at home and have babies because I would probably just beat the crap out of him. I would never go out with a guy who believes in censorship because I am strong believer in freedom of speech. I would never go out with a guy who follows all the teachings of the Catholic church to the letter because we would probably just fight all the time. Mama’s boys are out of the question for obvious reasons.  9)	Intelligent sense of humor- I want a guy who can make me laugh, but he should be able to appreciate funny movies and TV series that require you to use your brain. A million plus points if he has memorized the dialogue from the sketches and movies of Monty Python.  10)	Can cook his own dinner and clean the house- I have no intention of spending the rest of my life doing all the cooking and cleaning. Sometimes I have to go out and stay out late, I don’t want someone who will tell me that he would just go home to his mother in case I failed to cook dinner.  11)	Can sing or dance or play a guitar- I don’t want to hang out with a bore. When I go out with my friends, I want to bring someone along whom I can drag to the dance floor or sing in a videoke.  12)	Always looks clean- I want someone who looks like he just stepped out the shower all the time. Nothing turns me off more than body odor.  13)	 Someone who can give me FREEDOM- I don’t want someone who will hold me back from achieving my dreams, spending time with my friends and having fun with my life in general. I don’t ever want to go out with a typical macho guy who believes it is his God-given duty to protect me. No thank you, I can take care of myself.  So with my extremely long list, it’s no longer a wonder why I am still single.:)
