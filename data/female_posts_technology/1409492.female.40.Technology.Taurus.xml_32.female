There's a pretty park on the way with a running trail, as well.  I didn't do any jumping last weekend; the weather sucked. We did have a chili cookoff which I'm embarrassed to say I won. Embarrassed because as an owner of the drop zone I should have disqualified myself. But I won a spiffy tee-shirt so screw them.  It's also embarrassing because my recipe is so damn simple. Chili is nothing but ground beef stew.  I finally crossed a border I hoped I would never have to cross. I got a cell phone. Now I have to remember to carry the damn thing with me. I bought the cheapest thing I could find and it still has more features than I'll ever bother learning about, including a color display.    Top 10 Songs I Would Set Myself on Fire Just So I Wouldn't Have to Listen to Them Again:   10:  Cracklin' Rosie  Neil Diamond  I know every lyric to every Neil Diamond song and it's my parents fault.    Oh I love my Rosie child You got the way to make me happy You and me, we go in style Cracklin' Rose you're a store bought woman But you make me sing like a guitar hummin' So hang on to me girl, our song keeps runnin' on... Play it now-ow, play it now-ow, play it now my baby   I should sue them for child abuse.  9:  Dancing Queen  Abba  Arg.   8:  (Everything I Do) I do it for You  Bryan Adams  A soul-sucking song I associate with a soul-sucking movie:  urlLink Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves . Exacerbated by my husband's love of Bryan Adams AND Kevin Costner.  7:  Staying Alive  Bee Gees  Falsetto Disco Shite. I should sue my sister for sibling abuse for this one.   6:  Billy Don't be a Hero  Bo Donaldson and the Heywoods.  Double Arg.  5:  Turn the Page  Bob Seger  Mournful saxophone over Seger's whining about being a rock star. Oh, you poor man! If you can't stand being on the road, get a real fucking job!!!  4:  Juke Box Hero  Foreigner  I have a lot of hated memories from my teen years, Foreigner is one of them.  3:  Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin  Journey  Journey is another. At least I could laugh at Loverboy!  2:  Safety Dance  Men Without Hats  When the U.S. Army Rangers are sent to flush me out of my well-fortified compound, the Psy-ops guys will crank this up and play it night and day. I'll crack well before 24 hours are up and they can shoot me down as I run out of the compound screaming at the top of my lungs. It will be a mercy at that point.  1:  Come on Eileen  Dexy's Midnight Runners   Oh my god this song sucks. How the *hell* did it become a top-40 hit? It has a fiddle AND a banjo! Who is to blame?  Tura lura kiss my big fat cellulitic ass!  What can I say? Music makes me passionate.
