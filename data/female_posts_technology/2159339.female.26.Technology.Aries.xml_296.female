The more they played the more I liked them less and less.  TRS: They don't live up to the hype. Decent, but not amazing. Danceable music that sounds like The B-52s: girl singer, boy yelper. If you want to hear 80s music done right with modern relevance, see The Lovemakers. Their music is excellent, the singing is unbeatable and their live show is nothing short of exciting.  Gossip: They’re great. Beth Ditto is a powerhouse singer. She infuses my body with soul-wrenching blues. I love The Gossip and they’re one of the reasons I’m a member of the Church of Rocknroll. Here’s a mini-interview with them from  urlLink Kill Rock Stars :   WHATS YR FAVORITE FOOD?  BETH: hamburgers and fries for $2.80 at lews eastbay. BRACE: the number 9 at taco bell,3 soft tacos and a medium drink!! KATHY: sushi.   WHAT’S THE MOST EMBARASSING OUTFIT YOU HAVE EVER WORN?  BETH:a puff painted unicorn outfit,tightrolled with fuscia socks a pair of black suede shoes and a derby hat! i also had a perm at the time!! BRACE:my sister tried to tell me that i once owned a blind melon t-shirt,but, i know this is not true!! i swear!! KATHY:a tie with stirrup pants and a body suit.
