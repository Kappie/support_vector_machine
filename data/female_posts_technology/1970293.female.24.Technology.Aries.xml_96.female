Bardric leaned over the side. His eyes roved the area until he found a large enough clearing within the trees to view anything vital. Silver flashed within the trees as if soldiers were readying for war. That couldn't be, could it?   Trellian, I think there are warriors down there. Soldiers?" Bardric yelled.  The dragon swooped closer towards the trees looking for a large enough clearing to land. All of a sudden the dragon dropped to the ground. Bardric grabbed tightly to the scales. Trellian landed with a slight thump, jarring Bardric only slightly from his seat.  They glanced around the clearing and through the trees. Not long though they were surrounded by a ring of armor armed with swords. Bardric glanced at Trellian before glancing around the ring again.  "Who is your leader?" Trellian asked as he looked closely at the steel ring.   "I am." A deep voice announced from the right. A suit of armor stepped into the ring, lowering his sword before removing his helmet.  "Who do you fight, Sir?" Bardric asked quietly.  "We fight the Drakken of course. They are like disease in this land. Which side are you on?" The soldier replied.  "Oh we're against the Drakken ourselves. We've been gathering information though not very good information." Trellian replied quickly. "We're actually on our way to speak to the elves about the Drakken."  Another suit stepped into the circle. Only this suit was much different than the one for the man. This suit looked so light and so shining that it couldn't possibly be human or even dwarven made. The suit didn't require a helmet so it was easily to see that this was no man but elf with pointed ears and silvery hair.  "Ahh I see. The elves already know." Trellian looked closely at the new figure.
