And after another rowdy evening with the GEMS girls, my roomie and I will hit the open road and head east.  I can't wait.  I love road trips.  I know, a seven hour trip hardly classifies as a road trip, but that's what I'll call it anyways.  I hope the weather is nice.  But now I must go home and eat something and pack some clothes, etc, etc.  Till tomorrow...
