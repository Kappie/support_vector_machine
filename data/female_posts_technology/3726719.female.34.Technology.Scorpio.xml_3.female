Friday...saw me out and about after work with Betsy, Marsha, Lori, and Margaret.  There were many drinks had on the patio at Chili's.  :o)  Saturday...was a beautiful sunny day...until I went maniac in the kitchen killing flies!!  On such a pretty day, I like to open the back door for the kitties to go out on the patio.  And it seems every fly within a 5-mile radius has radar tuned into my house.  So either the fly killing spree annoyed or freaked out roommate Douglas.   When he couldn't take it anymore, he decided to install  urlLink the cat door .  :o)  It's awesome.   Chloe has taken to it quickly.  Abbie and Bailey are a bit more skeptical.  And once we got the furballs taken care of, Doug and I decided to kick back, watch a movie, and drink adult beverages.  We went through an astonishing amount of vodka.  We were entertaining though.  And if a snore hadn't woken me....we'd probably still be passed out on the couch! (FYI - roommate Douglas makes a very good pillow whether he meant to or not!  LOL LOL LOL) Oh yeah, we watched "50 First Dates" with Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore.  Too cute movie!  Sunday....started entirely too early  (damn constructions workers)!!  Aren't they suppose to take Sunday off!?!?!?   Evidently somebody was way too motivated to work, because the heavy machinery started around 7 am.  After the vodka evening I had...it was not a welcome sound.  Surprisingly though, aside from the whole dizziness and having to hold on to the walls, I didn't feel so bad.  It is the first time I've ever woken up the next morning still pretty much drunk!  :o)  Needless to say, I didn't eat much during the day.  Never felt really bad though.  So while Douglas went to Alabama for the day, I lounged around the house doing laundry, stitching on  urlLink Storyteller , watching Sports Night, and just enjoying the day.  And then I was naughty.  :o)   I took a breather outside on the patio to pet Abbie and just enjoy the sunshine.  I realized while I was laying on the lounge chair that with the privacy fence, I could avoid tan lines while I was laying in the sun and not be seen. ***insert devilish grin here*** This made me think of my vacation next week and how much I would love to get rid of my redneck tan lines (I love to drive in the car with the window down and my arm in the sun - thus the creation of the shirt sleeve tan line on one side - I'm not often a passenger, so it's not even), and lounge in the sun listening to books on tape.    So off to Walmart I went.  For $20 I bought one of those inflatable kiddy pools.  I got a grass mat to put under it since my patio is made of the rough concrete.  It's filled with water and the cover is on.  I'm all set for my July 4th vacation by  urlLink the pool !  Which is a good thing since I've spent too much money and won't be able to go out and do anything else until after payday next week!  All in all it was a great weekend!  I expect a busy week at work while as I get things done before going on vacation.  Shouldn't be anything too rowdy though.
