The answer is simple, and I would tell you, if you'd only let me. So I will tell you here.  Thomas, I have never in my life seen such profound changes to a person in such a short time as I have seen with you over these past few months. These changes have affected me, whether you meant them to or not.  I am simply trying to figure out how or if I fit into your life with these changes in you that have made you almost unrecognizable to me.  Almost, but alas, not enough. You are not a stranger to me, though I wish you were. You seem aware of the changes yourself, but seem either blind or indifferent to the effect they have on the people who love you. I know your mirror does not lie to you about the physical changes in you--surely you cannot have missed the extra fifty or so pounds you've put on.  You are terribly, profoundly unhappy. You are despairing. And my broken heart goes out to you. I can only imagine what your parents are going through.  I know why these changes have happened. It is simple. You are swirling, circling the drain, as the paramedics so charmingly called it. You are in the unenviable position of being madly, passionately and obsessively in love with a woman you cannot make happy. Nothing you do makes her happy. As I wrote before, you have given up everything and everyone you ever cared about, in the logical thought that if you removed any potential causes of fights,the fights would stop, and then she'd be happy. And then you'd be happy. It is a logical thought path, except for the one fatal flaw--it doesn't work. For one thing, no one is responsible for anyone else's happiness, and for another, tying your own happiness into your ability to make someone else happy is a recipe for abject failure. So you are both desperately unhappy. I wouldn't take it personally, Thomas. Nothing you can do will ever make her happy. It's just the way she is, it has nothing whatsoever to do with you. After all, you aren't her fourth fiance for no reason.  If I could, I'd give you advice. I would say, "stop worrying about making her happy. You can't do it and neither can anyone else. Actually, we are all responsible for our own happiness. If marrying her and buying her a house and all that makes YOU happy, then do it. If dropping me as a friend makes YOU happy, do it. But if you give up the things and people you love in order to try to make someone else happy, you will fail, and then you will be even unhappier, because then you will be left with nothing.  So do what makes   yourself   happy, and let her do the same.   But, since you have decided to change the parameters of our friendship without informing me what the new parameters are, you leave me only two choices. The smarter choice would be to tell you to go to Hell, or rather, go home, because it's one and the same.  The idiotic choice is to see where and if I fit into these new parameters.  I am taking the idiot's path.    So I ask questions. Drop sonar. I have learned that it is okay to talk about German school with you. I have learned that it is okay to talk about home buying with you. I have learned that you want to continue to teach me German without pay,(but I think Nancy will one day soon convince you that I am using you.) I have learned that it is not okay to meet in person. It is not okay to even  ask  to meet in person. It is okay to discuss what is going on in my life, but it is not okay to discuss what is going on in yours.  It is okay to send each other some political stuff, but that I should not expect a conversation to arise from it.  I have learned that it is all right for you to put me down as an emergency contact should anything happen to you, but it is not all right for me to ask what I am supposed to do should (God forbid) such an emergency actually occur. This is the new world order, as I see it, from my annoying questions to you about what I can and cannot do now.  Friends do not put such one sided and bizarre restrictions on each other. So the conclusion is obvious. You are not my friend. But the problem is, I am still yours. And will always be. So I take the crumbs. As soon as I know which crumbs I am allowed to pick up. And the only way to find out is to ask. I am an  idiot,  you see. I don't know any better. I choose to put myself through this agony. Just as you choose to put yourself through yours. The difference is, I am choosing to do it because it is all I have left of you, and having you as part of my life once made me very happy. You are choosing to do it because it's all you have left in this horrific relationship of yours--the obsession to make someone else happy.
