Yes, at the time I daydreamed of essentially becoming a yuppie. How could I? I guess other than learning Japanese, hanging out with horse farmers and waiting for my eye lashes to unfreeze after showering, I had a lot of time to think of my lovely SF and what I wanted to do when I got back. The idea of a corporate urban lifestyle, as it was portrayed on Amerian and Japanese sitcoms alike, appealed to me. Up to that point I had only had jobs in food and retail and knew I didn't want to go back to that. It was actually a lot like the concept of suburbia, which I didn't learn about until college (I know, ignorance, but I didn't know a single person who didn't live in a city) but always thought of as this really neat place to live. Well, like suburbia, which I had the displeasure of 'getting to know' while dating someone who lived in buttfucknowhere, my realized current state of yuppie-dom has definitely lost the charm it once had in my head and has become  Office Space . So I am, once again, looking for adventures that marketing reports and proposals simply can't provide. Sure I can find another marketing or urban planning job, but soon it, too, will suck big balls.  M keeps pushing me travel with him around India later this year. Until now, I have given him the standard, broken record response for why I can't go - "I have a lease, awesome roomies, a boring yet decent paying job that allows me to read blogs while updating my own, and most importantly, a hefty credit card debt that I can't keep ignoring". Well, unless this fucking job upgrade comes through at the office, I will look for ways to ignore the debt and go traveling for a month or two. I will call it a sabbatical and ask for unpaid leave. This of course depends on where M finds a job in September - so far the dumb fool has only turned down job offers.  Anyways, that's all I have to say this morning, my head is still fuzzy from too much sleep. So, to recap (Batty, these have become my favorite three words) - I love my friends, I hate my job, I love SF, I hate Antioch. Oh and my little brother is leaving for Columbia tomorrow morning and I'm going to miss the little bastard.
