Its killing me here.Especially since I have a hectic evening coming up.No, it's nothing fun as such.Just one of those thigs you HAVE to do and get it over with.Not too thrilled about it.Too sleepy to even think abt travelling to any place other than home right now, but no such luck. Sigh.....  ohh and errr..did I mention SIGH!?
