Ha Ha!!Had a very bad headache in the morning... but I tried to bear with the pain... when I reached school, first thing is to on the PC and put the Tablet PC Road Show message on the TV messaging system... The pain was still killing me... I asked my Ibu to apply axe medicated oil on my fore head... no cure still... Mrs Tang gave me a 'mian jian kueh'... very hot, very delicious... after that, went around the school to stick the direction signs for Tablet PC Road Show... Back to TA office to do my AAD design causeI am meeting Dorothy.. Guess what? She bought curry puff and chicken pie! Oh! So nice! Then, can't stand the pain.. took my 'blue medicine' for pain killer.. slightly better.. Finally, I have finished all her stuff... sent by courier for printing... by then, the time was 11:45am... Off, I went to Thomson for tuition the sisters... today another long day... so tired... Waited for bus 93.. shit.. so long... finally reached home liao... so gald... Aiyah! The time now is 10.58pm... I am tired.. bye bye.. sleep mode now...
