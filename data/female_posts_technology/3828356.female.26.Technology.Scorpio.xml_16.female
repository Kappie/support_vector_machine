And, for the record, I hate camping.  If there's no bed, flush toilet, or private room with 4 walls, I'm not interested.  My cousin is still visiting today, so we hung out and did some shopping.  Just girly stuff.  Tonight we're going to see a movie at the cheap theatre.  "13 Going on 30".  Chick flick, perhaps?    Well, that's all I have to say for now.    -J
