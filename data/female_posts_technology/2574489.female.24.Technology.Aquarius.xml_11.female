Last night I got so engrossed learning about all the features of this blog that I didn't even notice when it was time to go home.  I looked at my computer clock flashing at me.  Whoopeee! I slinked to the garage where I park and made sure the matronly attendant at the exit had gone home for the day before I could get in my car and drive off.  It's $10 a day parking at this garage and I'm cheap/broke.  So far my luck has held for 3 mos. and I have been forced to pay only one time.  That was last Tuesday.    We had gotten out of work early, I went with some of my co-workers to a bar for some drinks (I just had a Dos Equis).  I tried to get the irritatingly perky waitress there to validate my parking stub but she said that they don't validate after 2 pm.  Fine, I went to the theatre across the garage to buy a movie ticket where they will validate after a ticket purchase.  I figure $6 is better to pay than $10.  I walked up to the booth.  Me:Do you validate a parking stub if i have a movie ticket? Booth Lady: Yes.  (She picks up her stamp and hovers it over the stub I had pushed across our divide) Booth Lady: You got a ticket? Me (thinking quickly):Yes.  Booth Lady stamps my parking stub.  Whoopee!  Smugly, I drive up to the exit booth and present my stamped parking ticket to the lady (not my usual matronly lady).  Unusual lady: It'll still be $10. You parked too long here.  Shyet!  Okay, so back to last night.  I untangled myself from the snare of the parking charge and drove twenty minutes home to my new apartment with boxes still scattered around.  I promised myself I wouldn't be lazy anymore once I moved into my new apartment.  I wouldn't want my husband to accuse me of being lazy again.  So I cooked (warmed up some ready-to-eat stuff), I washed dishes (threw them in the dishwasher) took care of the rest of the boxes (hid them in a closet) and tidied around the house (supervised my brother tidying).    My brother is having separation anxiety.  He'll be moving back home next Monday.  I am having separation anxiety because he does the laundry.  And he's damn good too.   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  I have a dream.  I have a dream that one day my weblog will look cool, with pics, and graphics, and that I'll figure out how to create borders and highlights around my text.  I have a dream that sidebars and borders will meet and hold hand in hand and that people will flock to witness this miracle.  And when they flock, they can sign a guest book.   LOL!  Note to self: learn HTML programming or get someone else to program my weblog to look the way I want.    Self asks: When between work, between working toward your MCSE, keeping house, and reading your latest Dean Koontz book, will you have to read up on HTML programming?    Self answers: We will make time.  The force is strong in us.    By they way, I highly recommend Dean Koontz's  Odd Thomas .  Link to Dean Koontz's site to read more about it.
