It will be outpatient, but it will be for three procedures seeing that I managed to completely fuck up the cartilage in my knee with a "bucket tear" and a "simple" tear with both the right and left portion of the cartilage. Basically the bone from the fib-tib is sitting right on top of each other which is why I am in such terrible pain all the time. (no thanks to the drugs.)  so It'll be surgery for me. fuck. fuck. fuck, fuckety fuck.  I'll be going under the knife 3/19/03. so if you don't hear from me in two weeks...I'm probably dead.
