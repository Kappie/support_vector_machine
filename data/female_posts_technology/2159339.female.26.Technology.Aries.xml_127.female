"She was like 'Are you going home?' and I was like 'No, I'm going to my car.' and she was like 'Where's you car?"...blah blah blah.. "So did you get her number?" I asked. "No. I would have if I wasn't seeing you. I always get picked up on when I'm seeing someone." Oh really? Well, bitch! "This one guy left a business card in my shoe this past weekend and this other one asked if I wanted to kiss him while we were on the lift" (as a joke because we both had extra onions on our burgers for lunch, but I didn't mention that part).  We get jealous easily and know that sooner or later this will blow up in our face so we use these petty stories as artillery in the silent war of 'who got the better deal in this relationship'. We sat there pissed off and quiet for a while, him stuffing his face with a burger, me staring out the window. Then he said "For our trip we should get those sleeping bags that zip together" and in our own sick twisted way, I knew things were back to normal.  In other news - I woke up with a black eye this morning. I don't know if it's from boarding or iron dificiency or if someone hit me without me knowing it. Right now it's more reddish-purple, but I think it will go through other colors and eventually hit black. I'm wearing it proudly like a badge or a Bart Davenport pin.
