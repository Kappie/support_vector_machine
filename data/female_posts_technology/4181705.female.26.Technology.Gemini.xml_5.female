I was involved in a relationship that lacked honesty, understanding, compassion, respect and trust.  Even though this relationship ended nearly 5 years ago... It's still the 'ONE' I can look back on and say... "I learned something."  The only thing I've learned since then is that the game is all the same... just on different levels.  When I was involved in the game, it was harder for me to see what was coming... Now that I've turned my back on the games... I can see it more clearly.  Here's my analogy... I'm a Wheel of Fortune freak. It's been my favorite since I was a little kid...  Every night I sit and watch.  And every night I say the same thing... "I need to get on this show and win some money!" But this is the catch... Would I still do as well on the show as opposed to sitting at home and watching?  Probably not... This is why I choose to look in on situations as opposed to actually being in the situation itself.   I've spent the last 5 years alone... by choice.  The first two years were difficult.  I self destructed.  I did everything out of character... and then in 2000... I stopped.  I decided to figure out who I was... And here we are... 2004 and by George... I think I got it!!! Well not completely... but I'm getting there.  I've started letting people in again... Well one person, let me not get carried away here...
