Who cares if a twenty-three year old skips or jumps.  They are just envious that she is happy and they aren't.  My, that was cruel to think, she giggled to herself.  Nothing could ruin this moment.  Time could stop down and she would still be happy.    She had in her hands the reason for her life.  The ultimate goal in which she had planned all her life.  A treasure chest, a jewel, a gold coin.  Joy coursed through her veins and nothing was going to stop it.  The day will go down in history as the day that made her so happy that she rejoiced with all of her heart, body, and soul.  And in less than eight months, she would have a baby boy or girl.    All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003
