He continues to be the most brilliant  importantdocumentarian of our time. This film is a must-see.   I knew the Cheney/Ashcroft/Rumsfeld/Wolfowitz/Rowe/BushSr, and to a MUCH lesser extent, Jr, was the most corrupt administration in our country's history, but I never knew to what extent. I do now. Not only doesthis administration need to go, but in my opinion, they need to be prosecuted for war crimes.   I'll post more later.
