While I love to cook, I'm not one to follow recipes, but having a better understanding of the chemical reaction that occurs when I torch the crème brûlée or caramelize onions makes me feel like I'm more responsible for the quality of the end product.    Kind of like how knowing that crunch you hear when you step on a beetle is the chitin that comprises his shell.
