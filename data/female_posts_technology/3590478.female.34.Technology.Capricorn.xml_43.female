I mean really,  ever ?  urlLink http://www.cifnet.com/~geenius/buffyquiz.html   I took it 3 different times and ended up being Drusilla every time. She's insane and clairvoyant. I'm most definitely neither of those things. And yes, I choose different answers all 3 times. Because choosing the same answers but expecting different results is pretty much the definition of insane. Which I am so clearly not.   Oh, this is cool.  urlLink http://thesurrealist.co.uk/slogan.cgi?word=Valerie   But only if you use your name. My favorites: More Valerie please. Get the Valerie habit. And Wouldn't you rather be Valerie. In the spirit of lard making people happy,  urlLink http://www.qmimo.com/qmi_home_page_007.htm   This was a link within a page I sent out a while back. Click on food grade. Very, very wrong (or exciting, you know, depending on your particular issues.)  I watched the 31st annual daytime emmys recently because A) I'm easily entertained but, as I believe we established earlier, in no way insane and B) none of my very best friends in the whole wide world ever contacted me about the season 6 Buffy fest.  (thanks a lot.)   What else was I going to watch? Anyway, It should have been called the 31st annual daytime crap fest. All my children was only up for 3 awards (none of which they won because they suck) and a video clip of the evil Michael Cambias in his meat hook swinging, zombie phase could in no way make up for Al Roker singing the theme from Sesame St.   And finally, THE BLOG.  urlLink http://valerieledbetter.blogspot.com/   I'm still loading it up with past stuff but soon it will be new stuff. Then, instead of an email the size of a textbook (much like this one, you're thinking, as you roll your eyes), you'll receive a quaint, tiny really, email the size of a hastily scratched 6th grade note. "I like you. Do you like me? Check A for yes and B for no." Exactly like that. This site has the option to post pictures but I haven't  only because the instructions to do so are vague and endlessly looping. I know blogs are supposed to be about the text but given the opportunity to post obnoxious pictures as well, It's just too tempting to pass up. Perhaps one of you fine geeks (and by fine I  do not  mean very best friends in the whole wide world because we saw how poorly that all turned out) could provide some guidance on that sometime. I've had to split these emails into 2 groups because the server here at work has some very special rules and filters. I'm just letting you know so you won't forward it because you thought I was having a seizure and left someone out. And also to protect you from a sound slapping. No one wants to get this twice. Piffle, Valerie  Aidan: "Come on, we made love. We held each other. We even told each other stories before--you know, while we were falling asleep."  Kendall: "But I wasn't listening. You know me--I'm very self-involved. If it's not about me, it goes in one ear and out the other."  Greenlee: "You think you're packaging Fusion lipstick in containers you found in a chemical storeroom? Over my dead body!" Kendall: "Okay, let's all take a vote - all in favor of doing it over Greenleesâ€™ dead body, raise your hand!" -AMC
