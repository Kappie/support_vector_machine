We finally get our luggage about a half hour later and went to buy our tickets for the three-hour train ride we were about to take up to Groningen. I am now on the train writing this and I am taking some videos here and there. The weather is nice they said it is 50F out but it feels like 70F. It was raining now it seems to be clearing up.  urlLink
