I mean that means I MUST be less than the dreaded 35" at my actual waist, over the belly button .. and should be even smaller at my natural waist, when you bend to one side there's a crease .. that's your natural waist. It wasn't super tight, I could breathe but there isn't much space in the waist band to put like a couple of fingers in :)   I'm still at 175lbs according to this really buggy scale, will get new scale by next week - digital with BF calc. I have a really bloated tummy nowadays .. all fat, probably .. but I haven't had my period .. coming to 3 months now. And NO I am not pregnant.   Have to work even harder! I need to get to 150lbs (25lbs!!!!!!!!!!) in 4 months. I'll be happy losing 4lbs. a month (1lbs. a week, total loss 16lbs. to 159lbs) ... will fall short of target but who cares as long as I'm never this fat again.
