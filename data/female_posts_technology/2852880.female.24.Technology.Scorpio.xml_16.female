He has some connections with people who work there, so I had actually gotten to meet one of the Blue Men without makeup on my last visit.  During the show, one of the Blue Men creates a painting by shooting spraypaint out of his chest onto a canvas.  He spins the canvas while he is doing this.  It's quite impressive.  During this part in the show, B leans over to me and tells me that KtG, a friend of ours, has one of those paintings hanging in her bathroom.  I told him that was pretty cool.  Later after the show, B introduced me to his friend Kelly, who works at the theatre.  And guess what Kelly reveals from behind her back?  The painting from the show!!  B had arranged for her to get me the painting.  Isn't that sweet? :-)
