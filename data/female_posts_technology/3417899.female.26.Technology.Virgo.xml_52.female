Maccabi (basketball team) won the European League.   It was after midnight in Israel but listening to the Israeli radio (through the magic of modern internet) the party was just beginning.  As if we had won some war threatening to destroy our country. As if we had just been awarded the promise of peace everlasting.   Just a basketball game. I guess we really are thirsty for some wins and for some good news.  We're crazy - I think to myself, listening to the radio describing the scenes in Tel-Aviv's park.   But here a I am, thousands of miles away, in my comfortable Bay Area apartment, with all the luxuries one could ask for, and the best TV shows a click away on the remote... wishing I could be back there with the crowds yelling, or at least watching the TV with my Mom and dancing around, wishing I could be....  back HOME.   (My best friend keeps asking why I would want to go back to a place here terror is an everyday reality, the economical situation is worse than anywhere in the US, the weather is pretty terrible all year, my career prospects are sad, etc etc.  This is why. Because of the dancing in the streets when Maccabi wins the Euroleague.  Because there is where I belong to the madness).
