I am still not comfortable with going out at night because I still don't really know my way around. AND I don't have my own vehicle where I can just drive around, I have to take public transportation such as auto-rickshaws. Those can be tricky because I've been told that I have to be careful with them. If they know I am not from the area they will take me for a ride around town just so they can charge me more. So I really do have to start dressing like a local and maybe picking up their way of talk so I don't get taken advantage of. I am having two salwar kameezes made so hopefully that will help me look more like I am from here. I am getting more and more used the Bangalore and I really can't wait to finally move into my new apartment. Everything here really takes a long time to do, its really amazing how things still function here. I just don't get it! Being from the States I am very used to everything being INSTANT! I thought I was already a very patient person but this place is really testing me. Hopefully something exciting will happen this weekend! I am planning to go to Mysore and hope I will have a friend to go with me!
