Here are my top 3 choices for famous people I would marry except they are married already:  1) Conan O' Brien- for his sense of humour and brain. I'm definitely not after the looks. 2) Eric Bana- for that sensitive-boy look 3) Karl Urban- because he has such an interesting face.    You are going to marry Ashton Kutcher. He is kind and sweet, but pulls a lot of pranks (and probably quite a few on you too!!)and can always make you laugh. Congrats!!    urlLink   Which male celebrity are you going to marry?
