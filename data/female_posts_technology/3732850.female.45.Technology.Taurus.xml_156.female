Throughout the story, the author used many examples describing the love she felt from her family. For example, "We saw no problem with our parents sneaking some afternoon loving into their busy days. There's a good feeling you get, even at the age of five, when you see your parents madly in love with each other." She also talked about the teasing that went on amongst the family members. I think this teasing suggests that she was very secure in their love.   I think the most significant statement the author made was at the end of the story. She stated, "These memories from my childhood embody everything that I want for my children someday. I want them to appreciate what they have and work for what they get, just as my sister and I did with the milk." I think this statement speaks for itself because, why would you want to raise your own children as you had been raised if it wasn't a wonderful experience?
