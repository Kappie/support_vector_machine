On the mattress were a young man and a young lady, both clad only in underwear, cuddling and snuggling with legs wrapped around each other. A sign behind them read "Vegetarians make better lovers".. a large crowd gathered around them to see if they will actually do it. I couldn't stay b/c I was too hungry to wait around. Only in San Francisco I tell ya!
