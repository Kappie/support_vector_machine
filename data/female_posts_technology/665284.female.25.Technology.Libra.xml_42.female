It is about  Mai , a high schooler, who received an electronic notebook on her 16th birthday.  When Mai accidentally typed "Epotoransu",  Takuma  appeared before her as the being inside the notebook.  He then helps Mai win the regard of her school mate,  Nimura .  I was introduced to  Fushigi Yugi  then  Ayashi no Ceres  before this and it came as a breather from the first.  Whereas FY and AC have dark and heavy themes, EM is lighthearted and funny, less clingy.  The manga was completed after two volumes.  The story could've been explored more like maybe Takuma's quest to become a real human being!  Takuma over Nimura anytime!  Mai is so dense to not notice that when Takuma said "I love you" it was meant even though he took it back because he was just "joking."    Sigh.  More!  More Epotoransu!
