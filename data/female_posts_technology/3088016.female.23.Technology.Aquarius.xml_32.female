Fearing that he was near death, I did everything I could to get him some more oxygen.  I 'fished' him out, cleaned the tank and filter thoroughly, and returned him to it leaving the filter on.  I hadn't had this running in quite some time and I remembered why - it's loud.  Every time I turned the filter off so that I could sleep, he would again start gasping for air on his sides.  I finally solved the problem by sleeping in another room on the couch where I couldn't hear the filter but was uncomfortable all night.  Something tells me he's going to make it.  He's gotten through all kinds of less than ideal conditions before with me as a fish-mom.  I really don't want to give him the flush, but something has got to happen with that filter.  I'll look for another spot in the house tonight - if he's still alive then.
