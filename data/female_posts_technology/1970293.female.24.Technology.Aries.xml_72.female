"Yes I actually found out a lot of information about the wizard and the Drakken. I know where to look for the wizard but truthfully I don't want to look for the Drakken. They sound really nasty and you know how I am around nasty things." Bardric settled in and found something to hang on.  "Well, where is this wizard to be found?" Trellian asked before taking off into the air.   "Mandel said to look in the Foggy Mountains. The wizard will be living in the highest peaks in a tower. Why do wizards live in towers anyways? They are so drafty." Bardric grunted as Trellian lifted off.  "Because wizards have a high opinion of their selves. They think it impresses people. Don't you have a tower somewhere?" Trellian asked as he turned towards the west.  "Yes I have a tower but I don't live in it. It's too cold and breezy. I rather be outside." Bardric gasped at the cold.
