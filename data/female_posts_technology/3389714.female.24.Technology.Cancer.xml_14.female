I’ll keep the iron on very low heat and quickly slide my hair though it .. my whole freaking head only takes about 2 to 3 minutes to di-frizz…  so due to my luck today.. not only was it the most HUMID day ever …it was raining like a skanky sridevi rain dance video…the only thing missing was me in a see though tight *ss sari …non-stop pouring rain.. to top it off …it was my sister 8th grade graduation ..which I was already 15 min late for…  I ran out of the shower and got dressed to see that my hair had a life of it’s own.. I then quickly proceeded to turning on the hair iron and finished getting dressed… I propped myself down in front of the full body length mirror and started my usual hair straightening exercise ..however it was odd the iron wasn’t warm ..i turned the knob all the way to full heat… and nothing happened… the stupid thing was broken..  I ran out the door and rushed to my sister middle school with my afro like hair… and you will not believe who came to greet me at the door… an ex-co-worker.. I was so embarrassed… she said hi and asked it I got a perm ..i laughed and said bad hair day.. soon after my sister received her 2 dollar cheap paper diploma ..i rushed to the hair solon to pick up another iron.. this time I was smart and got the one that had a 2 year manufacturer’s warranty… I wasn’t playing games.. so it turns out the new iron is amazing ..and now guess who’s having an awesome hair day… ME!!!!   Question of the Day: Which is sexier ..sari or a bikini?  I think a sari is sexier…cuz it leave a lot more to the human imagination…
