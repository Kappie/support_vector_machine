We had lunch at Antoine's, where (according to Che's rumor) you couldn't laugh out loud. The mood at the place was just too stiff. Granted, the food was fantastic. But the place was just a big mood-killer. hahaha. So we had lunch and immediately stepped out and bled onto Bourbon Street. And drank. And walked. And looked. And took pictures. And wandered. And laughed. The street reminded me of Eastwood streets (if Madonna had a concert there). The streets and stores were wild. Time passed by quickly....too quickly.  Two important things to note on the first day, though. 1) We went into this place called LOVE ACTS REVEALED or something. We stayed at the back, because some friends were ont he conservative side, and we didn't want their innocence to be totally shattered. WRONG MOVE!!!!! Private lap dances were held at the back (3 of which happened not 3 feet away from yours truly mwahahahaha). 2) On the way back to Bourbon street (for dinner) from the hotel, we passed the casino. Since it was my first time to enter a casino (yeah, yeah, shut it!), Miggy gave me a quarter to play at one of the slot machines. AND I WON!!!!! Won me six dollars in quarters. Gave Miggy half of it because it was his coin that made the win :D   Second day was memorable for two 'events' too: 1> Cafe du Monde and Landry's --- doughnuts for them at the former. At the latter, I ate my face off hahaha. 2> Buggy ride, and the Aquarium -- cultural, historical, natural. I was struck with awe.  So far, this has been my best travelling experience in the U.S. to date. And it wasn't even Mardi Gras when we went! Ha!
