If I can grade all of your first Springboards before class tomorrow, I will give you time at the end of class to revise your second Springboard.  I would like one more thing from you. I would like you to write about your writing this term. I would like you to look over your essays and note any pattern errors that you have. Pattern errors are those that happen repeatedly, not just once. Then, I would like you to note any kind of problems you have had content-wise. Mostly, though, I would like you to talk about how your writing has evolved over the term. How has your sense of essay changed? What do you do better now? What essays illustrate that change? These are just a few of the questions that you can ask yourself, but if you want to focus on some other aspect of writing, do so.  This will be a sort of last prompt to bring together what we have done.   Type it in word and bring it to class tomorrow night, our final class.  Then choose your best essay to read to the class tomorrow night.  This will be our "Final" celebration.
