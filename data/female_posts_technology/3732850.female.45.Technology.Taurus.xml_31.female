These are the questions that I asked my self over and over and over again when I decided to go back to school. I would ride through the BSU campus looking at all the people walking from one class to another, wondering how many of them were my age or older. How were they doing it? Was it a possible task? Was I to old to be thinking about returning to school?  These are questions that still plague me from time to time but I have discovered, I can do it! It is possible! I am doing it! Somehow I am managing to go to school full time, take care of my family, work part time and still remain a sane human being. I will be the first to admit that I could not have done it without my family. They have been so supportive and encouraging. At times, when the load seemed to heavy, they would step up to the plate and do whatever needed to be done to make things easier for me. Granted, everyone is probably getting a little tired of Dad's "creative" cooking and his uncanny ability to get one red sock in with the white clothes every time he does laundry, but at least he tries.   I have a new appreciation for students, especially single parents that are trying to burn the candle at both ends. Give yourselves a huge pat on the back. You deserve it.
