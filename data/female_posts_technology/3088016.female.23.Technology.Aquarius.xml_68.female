My desk at work only sometimes reflects my mood.  I have attracted all kinds of office toys and whimsical gadgets to my "work area."  The short list includes a Muppets Magic 8 Ball, a set of  urlLink Magz , several squishy soccer and golf stress balls provided by some insurance company, three daily calendars (Get Fuzzy comic, Fold-a-Day Origami, and George W. Bushisms), and my favorite, two plush bendable flowers - one is pictured below.  I actually hardly play with these things anymore, but they and the fascinating mini-blinds cord keep people's hands occupied when they come to visit me.  Besides, I'm on the Ergonomics team at work, and I suppose that this is setting a good example in relaxation.   urlLink     urlLink      urlLink Kelly  is our resident photographer, and he took this picture as well.  I had recruited him on his way out this afternoon to photograph my RollerMouse for the Ergonomics team.  While he was there, he snapped a good one of the flower.
