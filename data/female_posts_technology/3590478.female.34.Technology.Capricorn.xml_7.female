(By the way hasn’t Mary been punished enough? She is  so much  better as a snooty bitch looking down her nose at the unwashed masses than begging and simpering for discount champagne and places to keep her extensive toiletries and prescription drug collections.)  Kendall, Greenlee and the mouth breather got trapped in the fusion elevator because Greenlee and Kendall were “pushing too many buttons at once”. (Snort! Whatever. Punching too many buttons at once in elevators used to be a hobby of mine and I never got stuck. It’s also amusing to jump up and down to make it shake and push the alarm sound button but you’d better be bigger than everybody else on the elevator because these activities provoke panic and a great deal of hand swatting.)   So then Kendall and Greenlee started going at it with the yelling and hair tossing and finger shaking. I almost wet my pants because I was sure there was going to be a slap fight or at least some hair pulling. Sadly this did not happen. It also made the mouth breather sad so he removed his shirt so the ladies would pay attention to him. They couldn’t have cared less and neither could I.  Simone and Mia heard all the squealing and decided the 2 of them could run the show on their own. I laughed out loud because those 2 couldn’t run around in a circle much less run a company. Juan Poopie staggered along and “fig bee evavaturh”.  (I’ve decided this putz has a speech impediment as well as an accent like that dopey naked chef kid on the food network. Maybe I’d had too much beer but he gets harder and harder to understand every day and until I have proof that he does indeed have a speech impediment I am going to continue to mock the way he speaks. As if it’s ok to mock people with accents but not people with speech impediments.) As much as Juan Poopie blows I still have the mouth breather as next in line for the meat hook. He’s just that annoying.   Speaking of meat hooks, everybody is still staggering around looking for clues as to who put Michael on one. Erica is on holiday but she’d better get back to Pine Valley ASAP or else Jackson and David are going to have her accused, tried, convicted and sentenced. Whew! That’s a lot of scenery that needs to be chewed, she’d be devastated if she missed out on all that.  David and Aiden had a little spat. Aiden (off his medication yet again and back to breaking and entering) showed up at David’s fine home and pretended Anna called him to check up on David. David was all like, “you retarded limy faggot, how stupid do you think I am? Anna has my number and unlike you she has extensive practical skills like dialing a phone.” And Aiden just starred at his shoes. After all, he’d already stolen stuff, he didn’t really need to have a  good  excuse for being there, just as excuse. So off they went to the police station where a huge row ensued. David screaming about breaking and entering, Aiden screaming about seeing David pouring scotch into the potted plants the night Michael disappeared. Jackson screaming about how one cannot go around just stealing guns and giving them to the cops there’s laws to protect citizens you know, and the black cop (I don’t even know his name but I like him) screaming at all of them to shut up and get out. (Aiden is seriously obsessed about that damned scotch in the potted plant isn’t he? Jesus wept dude; I can understand you think its alcohol abuse and all but give it a rest. That’s what you get when you forget to take your medication.)         Is it just me or is David looking a little better? Maybe he got a tan on vacation or it could be he looks better because he is acting a little smarter. Anyway, this was the part of the show where Jackson and David proceeded to dis on Erica.   Maggie and Bianca are going back to school. What? I knew Maggie was pretending to be in college, she has a dorm room and she used to have a test cheating boyfriend but Bianca? I never had a clue. So Maggie finds out Bianca did not have a  procedure  and flips out. And there’s, like, 5 hours of whining and mugging over the subject. Luckily McKenna changed all the words to Madonna’s papa don’t preach and was singing that at top volume, drowning out the buzzing drone of Maggie.  Honestly, even if they were doing these scenes naked I’m not sure I could sit through them anymore. Oh yeah before the buzzing begins Bianca has to make a speech in the quad about how the man is keeping her down and how she is sick of all the whispering behind her back and if she hears any more of it she’s going to beat some asses. (She’s a former anorexic, pregnant 68 pound lesbian. Somehow I feel beating some asses is not something she is capable of.)  Bianca and Lena are back together! Oh, well, maybe not. I’m really not sure. But they did “go to Maggie’s dorm room” and give some speeches filled with misunderstandings and double talk. Bianca told Lena she was pregnant but failed to mention she did not have “the procedure”. Since the last time Lena eavesdropped “the procedure” was still the hip happening thing to do. So of course Lena told Bianca she rocked because she got rid of satan’s baby. Oops. Of course if Lena had overheard Bianca say she wanted to become a coke whore in Prague or paint her toenails with the blood from a thousand tortured men I’m sure she would have been all for that as well. She just signed a contract to stay on the show but there are only 2 Lebanese in town, what else has she got to do but stalk and adore Bianca?    Oh no, wait, I know. She is going to fill her days letting Kendall be a bossy shit to her. Next time you see Kendall and Lena in a business setting, replace Lena’s name with Cinderella and Kendall’s name with wicked step mother (or sister, your choice) and you’ll see.      I forgot to mention: At Adam’s house they dragged out every relative of Junior’s that could be propped up/ wasn’t MIA under the pretense that, while at sea, junior learned how to cook (something other than a crack pipe) and was going to make them all breakfast. But really it was just a reintroduction to how ½ of the town is related. So there was lots of “my uncle-brother-cousin-daddy” and  “step-grandmother-niece-half-aunt”. Very amusing.
