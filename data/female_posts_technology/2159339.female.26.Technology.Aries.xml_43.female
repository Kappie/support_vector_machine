So, XX is actually here today despite having worked the graveyard shift last night. Abby and I were talking about how in a corporate setting, there is probably a euphemism for "graveyard shift" for instance "Supplemental Shift" or "Supporting Shift." I think that XX suffers because he sees it as "Bootsy-honkin-fuckass-shift-with-absence-of-Batty's-graces-so-why-go-on-let-alone-provide-tech-support Shift."   Poor XX. Nestle your head in mummy's bosom. There there, shhhh... There there, don't cry... Batty's here... Just relax... Doesn't that feel better now that your belt is undone?  Shhh... shhhh... I'm only unbuttoning your pants... shhh... shhh... I'm not that heavy, what are you talking about... shhh... oh yeah, oh god yes... shhh... now don't look at the monitor, look at me... see, now, doesn't that feel good? ... uh, yeah, uh, uh.... let me just, ah, minimize your applications and activate your screensaver... ahh, a galaxy of  stars... now just sit back and shhhhhh...
