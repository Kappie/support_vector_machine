I think he's a nice guy, but I'm not sure we click.  I'm going out with him anyway because my friends tell me I don't give people enough of a chance.  So, I'm not too sure about this guy.  I guess if the date turns out well, I can never show him my blog.  hee! hee!  I have had some very sweet comments on my last dating disaster.  I know nice guys are out there!  I even think that the guy I'm going out with tonight is nice.  We'll see what happens.
