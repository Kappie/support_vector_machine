I dont know why I am like them, I am scared to death of them, see their is one thing I know about him.,...it is that he usually gets what he wants..and I am so afraid that he will do something to make me loose the kids forever...and that is what my kimberly is scared of Work..i got to thinking about that today too....I had to sign something stating that I agree that they charge me 10 dollars in taxes every month..ya know its not the 10 dollars...but its the fact that they say I have to carry the cell phone...and that I have to be on call, and that I have to work that SAT....or answer the call at 2 am...then they are going to charge me for that ummmm luxery..then say you cant use the phone for personal use??  i have never used if for personal use and never will..but GEEEEEEEE I wasnt going to use this for bitching...but both have made me so upset that my teeth hurt from gritting....and I dont want to bother my ken about it....   well such is life.....I am just glad that I have my family...ken and all   4 kids..... i love them with all my heart......
