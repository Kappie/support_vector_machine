By the end of the night it was pretty sad because it finally sunk in that she was leaving today. The time went by way to fast. There is still so much for us to catch up on. She does not want to go either. She said there is way more to do here in Chicago than in Fresno. Collen leaves tonight too. Man I don't know what I am gonna do w/ out him for 2 weeks! I have never been w/ out him for more than 2 days. I can concentrate on my music but it will still be hard w/ out him! I am so sad right now. :o( Tonight I have to finish packing and make sure my house is spotless ( I hate coming home and having stuff I have to do right away) 1 more day! Although I will have to deal w/ the whole political convention that is going on in Boston. Oh boy!
