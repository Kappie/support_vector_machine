To post a comment, you have to click onPost a Comment then click on the really tiny "Or Post it Anonymously" link. They're being a huge pain in the butt. I apologize for Blogger's stupidity. I bet it was just some bad seed who designed that page, someone who doesn't put the customer as top priority. I've seen it happen firsthand in other companies. I bet I've been missing out on fun comments too.   Coincidentally, this is the second time I'm writing this post because Blogger somehow lost it the first time. There was an "internal error." Funny how that's only ever happened when I say negative things about Blogger.
