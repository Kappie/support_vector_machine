The memorials were full of people, probably because it was very sunny outside. I had a lunch picnic under one of the willow trees bordering the Potomac right before we did The Mall tour haha.  2941 is the best restaurant I've been to in DC. Folks near here should try it. People who are planning to visit DC and who happen to be food conossieurs...I tell you, this place is awesome.  Anyway, gotta go home and do some exercising. I feel fat from all the food :-P
