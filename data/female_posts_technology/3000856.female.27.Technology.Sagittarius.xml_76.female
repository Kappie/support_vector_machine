I was like Suzy fucking home maker. LOL My niece was supposed to spend the night and then she decided to go home w/ them. Which was fine. I have to do some errands and then go to my sisters so she can watch Collen while I work tomorrow. He does not start day camp till next week.  I have to figure out about school for the new year also.  Ok off to the gym. Laterz
