I wanted to feel my triceps tightening so I reached over with my other arm and that's when I pulled my shoulder muscle. How dumb of me.  It feels better now though.  Afterwards, my 'business partner' and I then went to look at two possible investment houses. One had evidence of black mold (very bad in Texas) and we passed.  The other one was a winner but it turned out there was already a contract on it (another buyer). Oh well, no biggie.  I went home, hung out with hubby for a while until my bro came over. Then we headed over to T's house and went out for some Thai Tea w/ Boba (at least I did).  Then went back to T's and played some pool.    Sunday, we went to church with my parents.  Then had a great steak lunch (ribeye) at Saltgrass Steakhouse. MMMmmmm-goooood!  Then we took advantage of a close-out sale at Just for Feet right next to the restaurant and hubby bought a new pair of running shoes.  We caught the 4 pm showing of Dawn of the Dead afterwards.  I hated it. $13 down the drain.  Then hubby and I went home, carting some wedding gifts from my parents house that we had no room for in the apartment.  I took our sushi set, and our pizza maker, as well as some scented candles.  Can't wait to use them all!  The only glitch to our weekend was the discovery that there's a problem with my hubby's oil tank. It's serious enough that I had to drive him to work today and had to wak up too early!  Hubby's new schedule has changed.  Hurray!  His schedule switched from 2p-10:30p to 9 a-6p.  Our schedule will now align better. This is in lign with a promotion and raise he got. But I'm more excited about the fact that our schedule will sort of match.
