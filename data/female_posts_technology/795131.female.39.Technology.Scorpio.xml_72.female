I watched us bomb and shoot the hell out of the Iraqi city of Falluja (sp?) last night, and I just kept thinking, "Damn, we suck!" I joined Curves for Women gym, but I only joined on a basis of one month at a time. Per month, it costs a little more that way, but I don't want a one-year contract, what if it turns out to be lame, or I change my hours and can't go? I really do work out there for 1/2 hour almost every afternoon now.  My husband kept his job at the St Paul Companies after a mass-layoff that they had, and even got a small raise. Men from India keep sending me yahoo instant messages asking me to do their USA job-search for them. They just don't get it.
