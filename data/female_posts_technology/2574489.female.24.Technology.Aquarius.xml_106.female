Especially if you're not a hard-core religious person and can keep an open mind.  Its very, very good!  In other news...It's Thursday! Closer to the weekend.  Have been very good at keeping up my attendance at the gym so our $$$ is not being wasted.  Although, I only made it to school once this week so far. I was supposed to go last night but I was too sleepy.  Got home, conked out at 7:30 pm and woke up at 11:00 when hubby got home...then went to bed again at 2:00 and didn't wake up until 9:30 am this morning.  That's 10 hrs. of sleep!  Oh blessed sleep.  Must try to go to school at least one more time before week!  And are there enough exclamation marks in this entry or what!!!
