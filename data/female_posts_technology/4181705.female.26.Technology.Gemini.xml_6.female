I can't even begin to understand what I should do... now that I know my dream will never be realized. My question now is, "Where do I start building my dreams again?" I've worked all my life towards something I don't want!!!  I've learned that we should never judge people on potential. We all have "potential"... but how many of us actually   realize our full potential?   I want to be someone that can at least come close to that realization. I will not perpetuate the cycle of school, marriage, kids, career, retirement... Who said life has to be that way? Mind you... I want all those things but if somewhere along the way someone told you... "you can't do _________ (any of the above)," would you want some of it, if you couldn't have it all? I've been told my entire life to never do things halfway... Do I want children without marriage? Or marriage without children? Years of school and no career? Retirement from what?  I'm only 26 but my mind is OLD... Old fashioned, traditional, whatever you want to call it... I've started losing faith in humans... I've consistently been disappointed by the actions of others whether they are female or male... I've lived in a belief that every generation will try to do better than the ones before them. Do I see this in my generation? Yes, but only a little... Do I see this in the generations after me? No... And it scares me. Why would I want to have kids? Why would I want to raise them in this crazy world? I see my little 4 year old cousin and get so disappointed to know that at the age of 10 he'll be more grown than I was at 13.
