Pay for high-speed access in the room, or have free wireless in the lounge overlooking the bay...  40 pages away from finishing my  urlLink book .  And even though I found a typo on page 223, I'm still enjoying it.  Learned something, too.  I've never been able to figure out where the polar bears are...  But "Arktos" is Greek for bear.  So polar bears are in the Arctic.  And "Anti-arktos" (Antarctica) has no bears.  Go figure.    I know, easily amused...
