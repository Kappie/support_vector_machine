Here's my latest youngest newest nephew...ZEUS!   urlLink    Yeah Zeus, that greek myth god  urlLink Zeus . We also call him Zee. Look at that face, Oh sooo cute!  I don't have kids but I don't mind hangin' around with these little adorable creatures every now and then. I have two places now I call "home" - Santa Rosa, California and Cebu, Philippines. We seem to never run out of babies somehow. Yeah fun, huh? Really.  Here's another one with him running around...   urlLink    He is such a boy! He just turned 13 months old two days ago.  Yes, babies everywhere I go. Here I either get to play or babysit Budz's niece and nephews. And whenever I visit my cousin Lalaine down in Long Beach, two more kids there, too. And in Cebu, 12 nieces and nephews! They're not all babies anymore of course but half of them still are - I wish they don't grow up so freakin' fast. I miss them tons!   urlLink    He looks so adorable in his baseball cap. Can't wait to see him soon.   urlLink    I can see he's got that "chickboy" look already on his face. Oh Zee, you are soooo going to take a lot of smooch down from me when I see you!  It's always a nice thought to know that I can always "borrow" one if this "play-a-baby craving" hits me once in a while. And the best part of it all is I can always return them when they start getting fussy. tee hee.  ....And we also get to see Budz's sis Carol and his little niece Lily this afternoon...   urlLink     ...I spy with my little eye...something beginning with a letter L...Lillian! I love the baby goob!
