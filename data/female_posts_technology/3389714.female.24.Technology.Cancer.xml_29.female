I never minded the rain ..but today I was beyond irritated.. It was driving me nutz…didn’t have to go to work today ..dad thought it would be a bright idea to hit the hospital in the morning to get his x-rays done…We made it to the hospital at 8:30 ish… I decided to quickly brush my teeth and there was no need to immediately shower ..with the rain and all .. so I headed off … dad was in pain… he had this wrinkled look on his face.. where he attempted to look calm and kewl..but in turn he was screaming bloody murder inside.. anyways got to the hospital..where there was a waiting room full of people…I could see dad getting irritated by the wait and once we were called… dad all of the sudden turned into a horrid monster..which was not him..i mean it was odd…a extremely pretty nurse called out mom’s name cuz the insurance was under her name..but the prescription was under his…that what caused all the chaos..dad snapped at the pretty nurse… and she was baffled ..and continued her work…it was odd..dad only yells when he is deeply hurt…x-rays were performed …and we headed home..decided to ease the tension by playin this bhangra CD I have… dad didn’t comment on it ..so I decided in my head he luved it..or I’d like to think he did…anyways got home … made lunch..and headed upstairs to do laundry..i decided to do 2 loads cold and hot…separated clothes and tossed a load in the washer..headed upstairs to pack clothes for trip to PA..found out that I didn’t have many clothes that I can pack …they were mostly in the large laundry pile in the center of my room…which in turn lead me to my bed and then I took a nap…woke up..ran downstairs to the basement to toss wet laundry into dryer to find brother's oversized getto *ss clothes stuffed in the dryer…to top it off they were ½ way dry.. decided that I would place his clothes in an empty laundry basket and pop my clothes in ..mom bought these amazing dryer sheets that smell like … a great big rose garden.. tossed 2 in…headed up stairs to find dad attempting to cook dinner in the kitchen by sitting on an office chair..it was a sad moment in the name of absolute boredom…dad was cookin cuz ..yes he was bored…he decided to make bangan bartha…eww…I asked if he needed help he snapped back that he was not crippled just temporary out of order ..i managed to laugh a bit in my head…I felt so awful..i let him go about cookin..and told him to give a shout if he needed me…I trotted upstairs and ended up back in bed…Arthur on PBS just finish as I woke up and saw the time…raced downstairs and grabbed the laundry out of the dryer..yes it was still hot…quickly folded the clothes and hung the ones that need to be hung…I like folding my clothes right out of the dryer ..i avoid the iron routine..which I despise..yuck yuck…pop the second load in and happily pranced upstairs to find dad layin on the living room floor with a gigantic blueprint in front of him…had this sudden urge of walkin all over his blueprints just cuz I luv the rustling sound under my toes..but I knew dad would have me murdered ..if I ruined his work…lol..walked by with a sheepish smirk on my face into the kitchen and grabbed a water bottle..i seriously need to start drinkin a lot of water ..i’ve gotten really bad..dad said we should go and get the x-rays from the hospital so back to the rotten hospital we go…I hate goin there..it smells like death….or I think it does…still rainin ..eww..came back home placed last load in dryer ..and started packin clothes …my brother and I decided to visit my aunt (b’masi) in PA..i was excited .. I was finally getting out of the house..yippie…called b’masi and asked her if she wanted any groceries she stated all she needed was squash…and to pick up dinner she the kind of person that u would go into utter shock if u saw cookin..i’ve haven’t really seen b’masi cook a meal since she got married to A’kaka…and had baby M and baby V… I really didn’t care ..i luved A’kaka warm breakfasts and barbecues...it was summer and I’m goin to enjoy it…masi said to pick up famous pizza and I thought it would be a good idea too…not knowing how much traffic we’d hit…brother came home from school to toss his ½ wet clothes back into dryer and attempted to have a small snack..i was starving ..but didn’t know what to eat..i did the usual walked into the kitchen announced to dad I was hungry dad grumbled “eat something” I grabbed 1 grape from the fruit basket and called it lunch...yes I know I’m totally insane ..now leave me alone…left home and hit a bit of traffic near the shore points then nailed 90 all the way on PA turnpike..it was great..managed to keep bro entertained by speakin in my atrocious Guju to him..i literally thought he was goin to pass out from laughin so hard..that’s when it hit me ..i had to go pee..like no other..i couldn’t concentrated on driving I had to go soo bad..and there wasn’t a rest area in sight ..i hate takin a random exit..cuz I never know what it’s goin to lead to ..but I had to soo bad… I took the exit and drove for a ½ hour to find a burger king..went pee..and felt like a million bucks..yippie..got back on the turnpike and nailed it to masi’s place before it got dark…we all hovered the pizza and grabbed the kids and went to bed…    Saturday:   Woke up by M standing over my bed … poking her little fingers into my eye sockets ..can’t believe she got so tall…in a few short months..kids these days grow up so fast..b’masi said V was not feeling well and she had to take him to the doctor’s..so she took bro with her and I went to take a shower…A’kaka was headin off to the gym when I walked downstairs…I saw that masi left a cup of coffee for me which I nooked in the micro..and had a small cinna bun..for breakfast..and guess what they had a desi program on for me..odd huh just as I was through putting dirty dishes in the dish washer a hindi movie started it was called Ganga ki saugand…or some thing like that ..it had rakha and I like her..so I sat down and chilled ..b’masi walked in with M and V..V looked horrible…and cranky..he wouldn't go by anyone..so I decided to chill with M…A’kaka came back and took bro to their neighbors BBQ..and b’mais and I decided we’ll go later … we put the kids to sleep and A’kaka came back and b’masi and I left ..the BBQ was fun but I got soo bored … I was surrounded by little toddlers or extremely pregnant women who were talking about swollen legs and nursing..i decided I was not interested in either topic and I grabbed a toddler and headed outside… it was fun these 2 adorable girls about 4 yrs old were dressed up as princesses ..soo cute..masi called me in for food..and I had a veggie burger and some pasta salad..we ended up sitting in the sun talking about interior decorating ..which was another topic I had no interest in and I tended to focus more on the horseshoe game the men were playing..we finally left he neighbors…yippie…we got home and masi had to feed the kids..she made kitchadi..eww..felt so bad..masi was pissed..M was not eating right cuz we were all around … she kicked A’Kaka and bro out so they hit a movie and I was sent upstairs and not allowed to come down till I was called…that sucked ..i decided that their dinner would take about an hour so I decided to call D a friend that was visiting from UK … she was busy..so I took a nap..to be rudely awakened by b’masi screams ..she was so loud…and M was cryin…I decided to stay in the room and not go downstairs…soon after masi called me down and the kids were fed…there was a smile of pure satisfaction on masi’s face and empty bowls in her hands…it was great ..now all she had to worry about was them not throwing up…A’kaka and bro came back and bought home toco’s for dinner..once again masi got out of cookin…went to bed after dinner….  Sunday:  Woke up at 10:30 was shocked the house was extremely quiet…walked downstairs to see masi with V in the kitchen cleaning ..odd..she said V threw up in his sleep and gotten the bed dirty..i don’t know how she does it .. I put her in the super women category ...amazing…I’d loose my kewl if I was her…she said A’kaka was goin to BBQ today I was so excited ..and kaka would also make breakfast…bro came downstairs and kaka decided to make veggie soy bacon and sausage .. for me and masi cuz we don’t eat meat…and French toast for my brother…meanwhile I played with V and M in the toy room..had breakfast ... it was amazing…B’masi said she need to get a few thing for the BBQ and now that M’masi was joining us we need more burgers…and she also was in desperate need of a pedicure ..god b’masi is so high maintenance ..lol…we hit a few clothin stores .. and masi bought a few capris and shirts…It odd everything masi puts on looks great on her.. she looks a bit like sri devi from the old hindi movies ..absolutely gorgeous .. so when she plaster a smile on her face I could almost imagine her on the bollywood big screen..i’m glad I have her as an aunt..she really something..we headed off to the super market where we picked up stuff..and headed off to the nail salon to find out that it was closed …we went home and masi took V up for a nap and I cut up all the veggies and A’kaka fired up the grill.. I was starving..M’masi came with V’kaka and Big A and Little A… it was fun having dinner with the family in the yard..listenin to lawnmowers and kids playin in the distance.. Food was great once again A’kaka out did himself..we quickly cleaned up to find ourselves snuggled up in the living room watchin National Security it was beyond hilarious .. M’masi and family left and B’amsi and A’Kaka took kids to bed ..i was now wide awake and bro and I decided that another movie was a good idea … we ended up watchin Hollywood Homicide .i think… don’t remember the name but it was with josh hartneck..umm yummy…went to bed..  Monday:   Woke up brushed teeth headed downstairs in totally shock ..nearly died…saw god and a light at the end of the tunnel…I could not believe it ..a women that looked like b’masi was in front of the stove stirring some delicious smelling content..i was amazed ..Bro was sitting at the kitchen table patiently awaiting what b’masi had stirred up..she told us not to eat much cuz it was an appetizer ..i never had an appetizer for breakfast but hey she was cookin and I wasn’t about to complain ..then she took out the big guns and made dosa…I was utterly amazed …dosa was sooo yummy..i was in heaven..this was a vacation…masi made me some wraps for the week and bro some Mexican bean dip..Masi told me to go to the super market to pick up milk, marshmallows, lettuce and onions…I managed to find all these items and I was headed out when I found a bar of Toblerone candy…masi had told me her fantasy was to sit in her room with a big bar of Toblerone candy without the kids and devour the over sized candy bar all by herself..so I bought it for her…I thought hey I can provide her the candy and A’kaka can watch the kids for an hour..and she can live out her fantasy…got back to masi’s and packed up car with luggage and food.. and we were on our way..we knew we were goin to hit traffic so I was mentally prepared for the cursing and the swearing that would come out of my mouth during our drive back…we were off …we got on the PA turnpike and nailed 80 all the way to the Delaware bridge..I was glad my friend P kept calling or else I would have lost my sanity with the traffic and my bother’s annoyin “Are we Home Yet”every 5 min. … we hit the NJ turnpike and it was over Satin was punishing me …I never saw traffic so damn think..why the hell does every one want to live in jersey… I mean I live there cuz I have to ..but it was insane ..i tried to keep my kewl..with all the stupid people drivin like the roads were owned by their dad's .. I mean have u ever heard of a turn signal..it was nutz…sort of like a war zone..like Kurukshetra from the Mahabharata..just replace the chariots with Toyotas Camery’s and Honda Civic’s..it was insane…got home to find we had company over..went to get dad prescription from Rite Aid..to find it was closed ..no biggie went home had dinner…and hit the sack…yes yes I know alone…I need a man…
