Ash Wednesday was only yesterday and I have broken the vow twice already.  I am such a carb addict; more specifically, a rice addict.  There is just something wrong with the way some of the food I eat taste if it is not eaten with rice.  Spam, fried chicken, chicken teriyaki.  I like them with rice! For lunch today, I was determined to renew my promise.  I  baon ed chicken teriyaki with potatoes, bell peppers, squash and corn (still carbs).  I also munched on some fries today.  Arrgghh!  Is there a Carb-Aholic Anonymous I can enroll in?
