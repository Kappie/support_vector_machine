Instead, it's nearing midnight and I'm hyped up on prednisone and a variety of other prescription meds and am looking forward to surgery in the morning.  Guess next time I complain about needing time off work, I need to be more specific about the context...  Good thing I got TiVo set up.    ...OK, Joe got TiVo set up.
