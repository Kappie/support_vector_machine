The locations of these bathrooms are…  Upstairs:  1 jack and jill in between G masi room and Anji’s room 1 – 2 entry that leads to hallway and K’s room 1 in guest room  Downstairs:  1 in breakfast area 1 in hallway  1 in master bedroom  Basement:  1 across from maid’s quarters (used as storage room – due to lack of maid)  …now in this 10,000 sq feet house…we got multiple bathrooms that are equidistant from each other…due to convince… most of my time is spent in G Masi’s over sized kitchen or her family room… which is located downstairs… but I’ve noticed the nearest bathroom to this area is the one in the breakfast area.. however when nature calls I’ve found myself sprinting numerous times up the spiral staircase into the guest room to use the potty… I know it’s odd I have to go up 20 something stairs just to take a piss.. maybe my butt is comfortable on that toilet maybe they have this mysterious bond… I don’t know why I can’t use the one in the breakfast area… once masi put me up in the master bedroom (downstairs) cuz the guest room was taken…I’ve noticed that when nature called again I ran up the stairs into the guest room… I know I’m a total weirdo… but it gets worse… u know when u got to go so bad that u start doing the pee pee dance…I still tend go up to the guest room and start praying that my bladder won’t betray me on stair number 13…I know I’ve got a serious problem…I’ve been known to have public toilet phobia ..but this is a bit more serious…I’ve noticed that I’ve been picking favorites in my own home.. luckily we only got 2 bathrooms…and I prefer the one upstairs… the sprint up the vertical stairs is much easier ..plus we only got 14 stairs…I’m hoping I’m not the only one out there with this favorite toilet issue…   Question of the Day:  Do you have a favorite toilet or urinal at your work that you always use..if so why?
