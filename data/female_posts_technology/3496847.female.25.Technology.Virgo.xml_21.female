I agree with the critics who have said that it is impressive visually, darker than the first two movies, and maybe a bit too scary for the younger children.  However, I found that too much was left out.  I am a fan of the books, but I do understand that they can't be translated to the big screen word-for-word.  In my opinion, there were two major points in the book that were left out of the movie.  The first makes the film it a bit confusing for anyone who isn't familiar with the book.  That would be the relationship between James Potter (Harry's dad), Lupin, Sirius Black and Peter Pettigrew.  I noticed it in the film when Harry is caught by Snape in the hallway at night.  Harry was using the Marauder's Map to follow Pettigrew.  Lupin saves Harry from the wrath of Snape and takes him back to his office.  Lupin knows that the blank piece of parchment Harry had on him was a map - he says so to Harry, but Harry never questions how he knew that.  Nor does Harry interogate him about Sirius or his dad.  I thought this was a serious oversight.  I was confused a bit, and I had re-read the book last week.  I also missed seeing the true Hagrid.  How happy he was to be able to teach a class, and how sad he was over the incident with Buckbeak.  He genuinely cares for the students.  The CGI creature was excellent, but it seemed out of place.  Without knowing what a good pet he was to Hagrid made that arc seem like a device just to allow Harry and Hermione to rescue Black.  I was glad to hear Hermione call the creature "Beaky" as they were leading him into the forest.  I do think there were parts of the movie that were very good:   I liked the scene in the boy's dorm where they are eating candy that makes them make animal noises.  It seemed like a realistic portrayl of 13-year old boys at boarding school. The chemistry between Ron and Hermione is progressing nicely.  It's very obvious in the fourth novel, but they are handling it well in the films. The Whomping Willow - because I hate birds too.  They sit outside my bedroom window, starting at the crack of dawn, torturing my cat.  She has to walk across me in bed to get to the window to meow at them.  I loved seeing the tree destroy the birds.  Quidditch - need more be said.  Always a good scene. The Dementors.  I avoided the previews because I didn't want to see them before I saw the movie.  I heard that they are similar to something in the Lord of the Rings films, but I don't know.  I was the first one and hated it, so I haven't watched the others.  The Dementors didn't look like they do in my mind, but they were very convincing.  I didn't expect to see them fly.  I saw them a gliding just above the ground.    You would never know that I was an adult - the way I go on about a children's film :) ****** Oh, I'm still running.  I did Week 2 Day 1 this morning.  I'm gong to run every second day.  I find it to be too hard to do two days in a row lately.  Too many stairs in my building.  Whoever said a four-floor walk-up is cute should be shot - Opps, that was me.  Must go play with the cat so she lets me sleep tonight.  Ciao.
