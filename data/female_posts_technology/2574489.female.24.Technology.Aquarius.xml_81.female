Can you believe just moments before walking into our apartment, after shutting off the car's ignition, I was telling myself,  do not get upset or frustrated with you husband tonight. You've been doing too much of that lately .  So I had a ready smile for him when I got inside the door.  Then I saw the comforter that had dried but was still sprawled on our coach.  Then I saw the pile of dishes that had been there since the night before.  Resolution flew out the window.  So sorry, Habeebi....I reall am.  I have the best husband in the world.  I must, must, be nicer....I blame it all on PMS...yup, it's that time.
