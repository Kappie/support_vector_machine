First  - because of all the different interpretations of "Pick up" in this context (pick up of passengers, a clean-up contest, a dating competition, an morale boosting contest, etc.).    Second  - because it reminded me of a young promiscuous girl who decided to see how many guys she could "pick up" and make fall for her, and then tallied the score every night in a pink notebook.   How far does that seem today.  How different I turned out than what I had imagined in those days.
