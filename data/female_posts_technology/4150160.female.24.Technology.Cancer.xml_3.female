How do they have friends and loved ones when they are such terrible people inside? I read a article about 2 weeks ago about "Bully Bosses"  and OMG... its true!  Except this time, the principal cant give the bully detention....  because they are too AFRAID to do it!  GRRRRRR- Poo on YOU!.. punk.  ( no no no! i dont mean you guys!.. if ANYONE reads it.. lol)
