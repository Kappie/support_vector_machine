I would have liked to have knit them something, but at this point there is no way my needles would be able to fly that fast.  Hmm, what on earth would they like? They already have a well-equipped household between the two of them. (Actually, I think my sister alone was set up pretty well, so adding her fiance's stuff ensures it.)  Perhaps some sort of southwestern-themed item? (After all, I do live all the way out here, so I should take advantage of what is in this region.) I don't want to give them a useless dust-collector, though. I must think upon this.
