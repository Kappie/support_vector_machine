For me, it is to increase the interactions between the locals, and the outside world. I guess in the west some people (not all) see Iraqis as masked men with RPG s , and suicide bombers, and Sader Militias, etc etc (all the negative images which are shown on TV) ...  For instance, I have never seen the city of Sulaimania on any international television. Fallujah is the most famous Iraqi city after Baghdad. FUNNY !  In the 1990s during the Kurdish civil war, I met some Turkish people in Kurdistan, they said we thought that in Kurdistan they eat people alive. Because what they used to see on their televisions about Kurdistan was men in baggy trousers and a little beard, with a bushy hair, and an AK47, brandishing their guns in the air. They thought all Kurds were like that. FUNNY again !  What we have to do as bloggers, is to show the positive signs of ourselves. We are not terrorist masked men, we don't like guns, we don't like beheading, we don't like killing, we don't like suicide bombings, we don't like torturing prisoners,  and some of us prefer our local Beebsi than Coca Cola (but not all)  !  I know that the foreign journalists are doing their best to cover all the aspects of our lives. But we also have to do it ourselves. This is our life in the first place, if we don't improve it ourselves, don't expect anyone to improve it for you.
