For starters I began to understand a few things about myself, work, etc.  I began to come to peace with my life and the confusion I have been undergoing.  Yday I had a long chat with a close friend of mine, a person who had just begun the process of picking up the lost pieces in life and moving on.  Quite a strange chat with the person, coz we both we in kindof the same boat really.  But then we kindof had some level of commonality in all of that, the pain.  Yes, the pain was bad and it was touching new limits, but then is this pain really something which is paramount that we both make such a big issue over.  Yes, emotional attachment is tough to handle, but is this as bad as a loss of a blood relation with whom you have spent a lifetime with?  For the last two days, I have been doing quite a bit of thinking on this, imagine the pain a parent goes thro on losing their child, their treasure given by god.  Is that pain really anytime to compare with a bond which is created by destiny for whatsoever the purpose which brings together two individuals from different backgrounds?  Its just an emotional commitment in this case, yes, it is deep but is this as deep as that of a blood relation?    What pain a mother who has a baby growing in her will feel if she loses the child at any stage of the pregancy?  I can hardly imagine the devastation she would go thro in this, it could be quite blinding.  Comparing that, is there really any pain in what we are going thro over a relationship which has lasted just a few months or years?    How does one really understand the importance of their relationship?  Well, its not something which will come out of material aspects but the immaterial aspects only of the relationship.  The amount of immaterial aspects one sows in the relationship is what makes the relationship a sound one. Relationship has no strings attached to it, coz the bond of a true relationship runs much much much better, so deep that one can only say, there is a connection, but cannot say what really bind them together.  It is an unwritten bond between two people which defines a relationship, their belief and trust stands are two pillars in this, without either of this ,one has no right to even call the relationship by that name...coz it is actually minus those aspects and it becomes an agreement.    Life is defined by relationships...some with names, some without....which matters, when it matters, what love and affection comes from where...quite a weird thing to define...but one thing is for sure..if you are in a relationship and you want to test the nature of your relationship...take a step back...and take an outsider perspective of things, thats where you will understand what is the nature of your relationship.  One always needs a reality dose when it comes to relationships, so no use not accepting the faults on the relationship. life is all about relationships, the more you understand them, the better and stronger relationships you get urselves into.
