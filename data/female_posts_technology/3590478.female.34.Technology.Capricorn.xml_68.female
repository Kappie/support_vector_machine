Fame and also Jaws II) goes to school during the day and gets straight As then at night she leaves the burbs to be a prostitute. She has to do that to earn money because she doesn’t have any parents, it’s all very suspicious. (I couldn’t be bothered to look up the synopsis on any of these movies to refresh my memory. I prefer to rely on my jaded, confused memories.) So then some naughty boys from her school get killed. They were naughty because they were out looking for hookers,  on a school night!   Lots of overly dramatic crying and cringing in fear and lots of overly dramatic crying and cringing in fear while running full tilt down deserted ally ways and streets. I think there was an older male cop with a heart of gold and a transvestite best friend. Or maybe the killer turned out to be a transvestite older cop with a heart of serial killing. 5) Volunteers This is exactly the type of movie I avoid at all costs these days and even back then. Tom Hanks sucks as a rich kid with a really wacky accent. John Candy sucks as a perky, brain washed moron. The kid that played Long Duk Dong in 16 candles sucks as a slightly less addled but much more put upon Long Duk Dong character. God, what a steaming pile of crap this was. It made the peace corp. look like summer camp. If summer camp involved retards with booze, women and gambling. And yet I will sit through it every time it’s on. 4) Wish upon a Star This is a Disney live action movie from the late 90s. It’s your basic, tired switching bodies movie. In this case two high school sisters, one a surly science geek and the other a perky cheerleader. I know my fondness for this movie comes from the fact that the two young women playing the sisters do so in the exact same way that Bianca and Kendall play sisters on AMC. Uh, huh. I’m going to hell. 3) Troop Beverly Hills I love Shelly Long. My evil radar must go off when I see her or something. In this movie she plays a mother and a troop leader and is so unconvincing at both that it’s painful. Staggering around in high heels with her hair dyed a circus clown orange she leads a troop of equally unconvincing tots to scouting victory. And who thought casting Craig T Nelson in a comedy was a good idea? Also filled with cameos by D movie actors such as Pia Zadora, Dr. Joyce Brothers and Robin Leech. I liked to imagine that Shelly and Betty Thomas were having an affair during the filming. (Bonus! Tori Spelling as one of the tots.) 2) Desperate Lives A late 70s early 80s after school special on the dangers of teen drug use. I think it was desperately edited down from a real movie called angel dusted. Which would explain why it doesn’t make any sense. Helen Hunt is in it but she’s still a child so that merely ups the cheese factor. More importantly, Diana Scarwid is in it. I worship her. (She was the adult Christina in Mommy Dearest and can currently be seen as the mom in Wonderfalls.) She still had her southern accent in this movie and her speech about the pitfalls of dope is priceless. 1) Times Square This movie is terrible. It has to be the nostalgia factor that made me put it at number one. Another late 70s early 80s movie. This one about NY punk girls with mental illnesses. The 2 leads were 13 and 16 years old and they both look 2 years younger than that. It was edited to within an inch of the plot to make it less gay thus rendering it the most senseless, not gay, gay movie ever. The soundtrack is stellar. I had it on cassette and played it so much that it started to die and Joey Ramone started sounding like Tony Bennett. (Then I snatched it out of the player and chunked it out the window of the car. That was my way of showing my disappointment that yet another cassette had died. 2 copies of forever now by the Psychedelic Furs, 2 copies of lets dance by Bowie, the Valley girl soundtrack and various other crap all littering the roads all over the south.) I wish I had the soundtrack on CD but I don’t think it exists. I suppose I could create it myself but that would require effort, which I despise. It’s much more time effective to just complain about it.
