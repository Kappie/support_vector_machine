Once we got to the  urlLink Marriott  (think spa in the desert on the TPC golf course...), I decided it was best to hang out here.  Won $2oo in half an hour and decided to quit while I was ahead (and even for the trip if you count the cost of changing my ticket, which I do, but Joe doesn't).  Hung out at the Irish pub here and called it a day early.  Might go visit that machine before we head out to dinner.  Might come back here next summer to get married.  Dave (the bartender) says he'll see us then.  Heading downtown as soon as we're all cleaned up and eat something to soak up the alcohol that we consumed at the pool.  At least I finally have a tan.  :)
