We're scheduled to launch our new CMS/web site/rebrand on June 11th and even though it never seemed feasible, we're almost there.  Of course, I spent the past day and a half redefining the information architecture and content migration mapping I defined 2 months ago.  And I'm pretty much at a "wait for things to be ready so I can get more work done" place.  So, no working late until it's time to manually move the rest of the content to production, and no working this weekend, as I'll be at  urlLink the race , and get back after a long weekend to work non-stop for 11 days.  And then it's done.  :)  And we get to start phase 2...
