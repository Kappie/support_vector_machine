In the middle of the night, woke up 2 times to toilet... 1st time was normal passing plus vomitting then diarrhoe-ing.. 2nd time was diarrhoe-ing... ha ha...!! Then, after that went back to sleep... till morning at 6:15am, my mum knocked at my brother's room said that time to wake up... I thought it's me... got a fright.. later, continue to sleep... In the morning, went to Serangoon market with my mum, reached home, swept the floor and mopped the floor... Then, my brother came back home... We drove out to the temple at River Valley for pray pray... next, we went to NTUC at Bedok... finally going back home... I waited till 6.00pm to watch the LIVE of table tennis -- Li JW (SIN)... so sad.. did not enter the bronze award... But at least she has done well... Beaten a lot of good players... That Korean player is making a lot of noise each time she wants to start... Weirdo woman... 'Har!' That was what I heard everytime... or else she can really win the game loh! Then, watched the 'xi yuan lu II'... Then could not stand any more... went to bed now... bye bye...
