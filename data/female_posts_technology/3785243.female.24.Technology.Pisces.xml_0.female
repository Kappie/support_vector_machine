This summer I decided to go ahead and take a 5 week Anatomy  Physiology course as it was one of the few remaining classes I have left before I have to apply to get accepted into the nursing school.    In hindsight, I would recommend this only for extremely brave souls.  The class requires HUGE amounts of memorization, and the lecture and labs got all out of order, so I ended up having to study twice as much, with no overlapping material.  Oh well, live and learn.   At least I know for sure now that the ankle bone connects to the foot bone.  :)  Or, to be more precise, the distal end of the tibia articulates with the talus to form the ankle joint.  But anyways, I'll probably be studying every conceivable chance I get, as I believe the final is comprehensive and we've covered 15 chapters of every bump, knob, and concavity on the human body.  So updates will be pretty scanty.  Only 4 more days til I can leave the hobbit study cave and wander around in the big blue room outside!
