I don't think I have the capacity now. Does it only come to me when I'm lonely and sad? Haha. Maybe, since you'll have more mental energy and little distractions to see, look, feel, think, consider. It isn't a bad thing at all. It's stages or phases of life that one goes through. I believe things happen for a reason. It prepares you for what may come. What you've gone thru let you appreciate the present, understand the past, handle the future.  I'm still walking. Learning everyday with each obstacles I face. I'm sure I'll be better as we go along.
