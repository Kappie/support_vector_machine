More and more parts of my house are slowly being overtaken by so many copies of 'Table' and 'Food Ideas' that one room is beginning to resemble some creepy, out of control dentist's waiting room.  I don't know why I need all those copies of Martha Stewart Weddings, in fact I don't know why I even bought them - with no wedding anywhere in sight either in the planning or attending stages.  But I think I can be forgiven for them as the lure of Martha is too much to resist.  It was difficult enough going cold-turkey with the Martha Stewart Living magazine, so many times lurking in the newsagency aisles picking up the copies, putting them back, picking up, putting back.  I had to break the Martha magazine habit, it was hard but I did it.  It doesn't stop me going  urlLink here  though every five minutes though.  Sort of like an online methodone program.  I don't know, do I really need to keep four years of back issues of Good Taste? All those dinner parties I'm having  - not!  And surely, I can't possibly need a recipe for pumpkin risotto from the August 1998 issue when I can easily look it up on the net, or perhaps find it in one of the myriad of cookbooks I own.   But it's the  possibility  of things that makes me hold onto those copies of food and wedding magazines, I'm sure.  And besides, it's better than being addicted to Vicodin, eh?
