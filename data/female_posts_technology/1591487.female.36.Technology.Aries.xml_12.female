A number of people I know have heralded the arrival of spring coughing their guts out as the remnants of various dreaded lurgies wrack their bodies.  Here is a small poem by Anne Sexton  I have recently read, memorised and loved, I hope it makes them feel a little better.   As it has been said: Love and a cough cannot be concealed. Even a small cough. Even a small love.  And no, I don't have a cough.
