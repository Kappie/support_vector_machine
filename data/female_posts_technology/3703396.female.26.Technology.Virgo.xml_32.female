All I could do was talk about my husband the whole time.  At one point I even caught myself in a giggle fit!  You'd think I were 15.  I'm so embarrased!  Anyhow, things are going well.  Tuesday I went in for my first meeting and did 25 minutes on the eliptical machine.  Is that how you spell elipticle?  I then attended the 60-minute water aerobics class.  Wednesday I went down for lunch and did 10 minutes on the bike and 15 minutes on the elipticle machine.  Today I went down and did 10 minutes on eliptical, then 60 minutes of weight/retention training, followed by 60 minutes of water aerobics.  Tomorrow is my day off from the gym.  I go back on Saturday.  Time for bed.  I figured I'd write a little before heading into dreamland.  I have to go in for bloodwork in the morning so my doctor can yell at me again for having high cholesterol.  Yay fun!  Then we're having window tinting installed on our office windows to help reduce the heat inside our offices.  I hope it helps.  Later!
