My aunt and uncle were there with their dog Ares. My aunt's sister came to visit for a night with her two kids, so my kids had some other kids to play with, so they were happy. we spend quite a bit of time at the beach. Harley came with us too. He had a great time swimming and stuff. We let him off the leash and he didn't run away like he usually does, we think it was because the other dog was there so he was being good. exceptional good.  My eating good is going ok, I did have a couple sweets and things on the weekend, but that is expected every once in awhile. I haven't been to the gym since friday morning and am not sure when I am going to get back, now that I am on day shift. After work I have to go directly to the babysitters and get the kids. Maybe on my days off.  If this post doesnt' make much sense it is because I am extremely tired. to busy of a weekend.
