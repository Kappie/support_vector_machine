Then out of the blue he looks at me and said, "I wish you would have me a baby sister, mom said that her tubes are tied but that she can untie them."  But he went on to say that he wished his dad and I would give him a little sister of his own, one he could hold and rock.  That was so sweet.  I did not answer him, cause I want to give Ken a baby so much that I cant stand it and I didnt want to tell him Daddy does not want any more, so I just kept my mouth quiet and smiled at him and told him how sweet he is.
