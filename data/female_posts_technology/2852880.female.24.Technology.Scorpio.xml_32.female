       
        Meet Megan Greene So far in my life I have known Megan White, Megan Brown, and Megan Greene.  Megan White was really mean and basically tormented me all through middle school.  Megan Brown was in my eating club and now teaches in the Bronx.  Megan Greene was my pseudo-roommate in college and now teaches at a fancy boarding school in the northeast.  Next I plan to meet a Megan Black.  So Megs and I were chatting yesterday about relationships and she made a little analogy that I decided to share (with her permission).  She likened living together to having sex in that there's no going back.  I suppose that's true.  They're very different beasts, and depending on your views on sex, living together can be an even bigger step.  Suddenly there's no going home.  And if you're sharing a bedroom, which you probably are if you're living together, then you just have a lot less personal space.  I'm sure there are wonderful things that go along with it too, aside from the obvious half-price rent and utilities.  Neither Megs nor I are living with our boyfriends.  I'm not looking to move in with B anytime soon.  At this point, I'd just be happy to live in the same state as my boyfriend.
