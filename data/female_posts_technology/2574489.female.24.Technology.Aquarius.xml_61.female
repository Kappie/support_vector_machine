Yup, my knees have been acting up for a while again and I met up with my doctor today. He is a little quirky.  Anyway, I get evaluated for my physical therapy next Tuesday.  I hope everything works out and my knees get better with no chance of needing surgery.  That's it for me. I'm feeling a little deflated...damn knees!
