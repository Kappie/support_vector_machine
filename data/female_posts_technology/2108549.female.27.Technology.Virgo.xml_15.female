See, when you have never been laid off, never been too sick to work, never stayed home day after day, you think work is a right. Its like its something you have to do and you are entitled to do it. After being home for so long, after all the lay-offs... I  get  to go to work tomorrow. The day might suck. I might fail 100%. I may even hate what I'm doing. But really... those are the worse things that can happen right? They can't take away my car, my dog, my sobriety, all they can do is fire me. And if those are the worse things that can happen, then I'm ok if they do. I'd really  really   really  rather they didn't but I can survive that stuff, done it before.   So I'm looking forward to it. At least this hour.  I'm sure it will change and I'll get scared again before 8am tomorrow but that's ok.  Freedom is a good smellin' pup again, laundry is done, and I got good healthy stuff from Trader Joe's for lunch so I think I'm set. Not much left to do but sleep! :)
