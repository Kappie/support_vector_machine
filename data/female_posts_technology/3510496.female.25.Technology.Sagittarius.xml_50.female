She thought it's the price tag before "more than 50% discount". The original price tag was 800 dollars. Ouch!  Good, old buddy me, managed to enlighten her, that must be a good, beautiful buy (though I never look at it, but I VERY trust her taste, one). So note to buddy, just make sure you don't museum-ise the shoes, like Imelda Marcos did, to collect dust.   4 Weddings     Ooops! You might be thinking me to continue to make a complete, movie name. But the fact is, that is the number of wedding invitations I have on National Day's Eve.  Shiok kan ?   August 9th     All that captures me is the fireworks. Back in my 'old kampung', I could visibly see and audibly hear it. Now no more (not the wonderful thing of being an extreme northerner).I remember at certain years, they have marched-pass by near my flat. FUN!   Fruit Day         In the midst of blogging this entry, the same, old buddy of mine, MSN that her company just distributed free guavas to everybody.  Ada kebun ke Boss you ? The past months, apples, oranges and mangoes had been distributed.  Promoting healthy lifestyle kot ? This is indeed a very good gesture. Errr ... any chances of free strawberries? kiwi? Anything exotica?    Hit JB     The unpatriotic us intend to hit JB on morning August 9th. But provided the traffic condition is smooth. So we intend to go and peep-peep the checkpoint first thing first in the morning (the wonderful thing of being an extreme northerner).  If not, we simply turn ourselves in as homely couple, watch tv and eat whatever is in the fridge.   *Sigh* Before I can get to all the above, I have to go through the remaining hours of work today. I've been putting a 'blind eye' on the in-tray of users' request forms. Even my China-boss has been 'ignored' by me. 'Lazy worms' are crawling inside of me. And crap! I still have to work tomorrow (Saturday). Uwekkkkkkkkk.....  Anyway, looking at Tammy  kena  fired yesterday, and Jesse, last week in The Apprentice, makes me learn one thing. Make sure when you open up your mouth for your team, make it a good 'contributor factor' to your team. But at least Tammy was 'outspoken' enough, unlike Jesse, who was ... over-'nice'?
