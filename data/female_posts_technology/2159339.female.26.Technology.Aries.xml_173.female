XX decided to show up after all even though Dizzy D was going to be there. The weird part was that XX showed up exactly 5 minutes after Dizzy D left. I was like, "Were you waiting outside in your truck, waiting for the exact moment, fogging up the windows with your creepy breathing?" and he laughed.   There was one guy who showed up, who didn't talk much and lurked around, who was a friend-of-a-friend-of-Abby's-pseudo-bf. I jokingly referred to him as "The Columbine Killer." The next day Green Marble referred to someone as "Trench-Coat-Mafia-Guy" and I knew exactly who she was talking about.   The funniest part was when my friend Z. came up to me in the kitchen and said, "Uh... your cousin just puked out the window." I turned my head, and Green Marble was leaning over the railing. I walked over and there was an explosion of vomit on the sidewalk below. And the people smoking outside were looking up at her going, "Hey! Watch it!" She giggled and pointed out the recognizable chunks of the orange she just ate.   The grossest part of the night also involved barf. The joker TJ MAXX and his bf came up from my room and said, "Some guy puked on your bed." I laughed at their silliness and said, "Ha-ha, nice joke." And they were like, "No, SERIOUSLY. Some guy puked on your bed!" I walked downstairs, expecting to find some sort of prank, but there was a guy slumped on the edge of my bed, a firework of puke on my carpet, and a smaller one on my comforter. I ran upstairs and squealed, "AHH! Someone puked on my bed!" and the SWAT team of barfer's gf and Jason hurried down and cleaned it up within 20 minutes. They were profusely apologizing but I waved my hand and said, "Thanks for cleaning it up. You guys are wonderful." I was in high spirits and nothing could phase me, not even puke.  It was nice to have all my friends and family in one place and ply them with drinks and food. Before we have another party, though, I have to work on my party tricks. I once had a co-worker who's trick was that she would start crying if she thought about the movie "Sophie's Choice". She also could do on command the spray that comes out of your mouth when you eat sour candy (glerp? gleek?). Saturday night, W-gal busted a move. She bent over and revealed her bony spine poking alarmingly high out of her back. She told us that not only is she human, she's also a dinosaur: specifically, a stegosaurus.      I wonder which dinosaur I am? If I had a pinhead, I could be a pteradactyl. If I had a long neck, I could be a brontosaurus. Which dinosaurs have huge heads and speak valley girl Vietnamese? Cuz I would definitely be that one.
