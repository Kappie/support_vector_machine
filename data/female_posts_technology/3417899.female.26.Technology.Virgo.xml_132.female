It was passover night, and we were celebrating the Sedder at our house - as usual. A few minutes before the Sedder began I get a call from Sagi. Sagi was a friend, I guess, with the potential for more.  He was 3 years my senior and (though it seems funny to be writing this 10 years later) he was one of the most "popular" guys in our neighborhood. Extremely good looking, smart, dark broody mood... into art and science. Was in Pilot's Training in the army (very prestigious - for those non-Israeli's reading my blog).  Most of the girls in my grade fantasized of Sagi looking at them. I had the privilege at the time, of being almost a friend.  We would meet every few weeks and talk for hours, about everything and anything. We would flirt. We kissed a couple of times...   So that Passover night, Sagi called and asked if I wanted to come over after dinner (he lived down the street). My parents obviously wouldn't like me to go anywhere on Sedder night, but I said I would.  As soon as dinner was over, I slipped out of the house with some excuse. I was still dressed up in the Sedder clothes, a skirt, a white buttoned down shirt  tied at the bottom that exposed my belly.  I walked over, heart beating fast. (I was a very confident girl back then, nothing shook me, I was in control. But with Sagi - I turned to putty).   When I got to his place we talked for a bit, then moved to his bedroom. I knew something was going to happen tonight. I was expecting it. I was wanting it. He looked like he did to. We started kissing and then Sagi moved away. He looked at me intensely and said, slowly: "Unbutton your shirt". Almost commanding me to do it. In a haze, I did - doing my best to look sexy while doing so.  I slowly untied the tie at the bottom of my shirt. He smiled. I unbuttoned my blouse - starting from the bottom. One button at the time, not taking my eyes off his.  When my shirt was undone, it was still covering me, only showing a thin line exposed down my center. Sagi moved the shirt to one side with his finger, brushing my stomach while he did. Then the other side. My breasts in all their glory were exposed in a brand new lace bra. Nipples showing through. I remember the shivers down my spine in those seconds. His eyes fixated on my body. His mouth slowly turning form a frown to a smile. I remember he licked his lips. I knew what was coming and I wanted it, bad.   Then Sagi said suddenly said "OK. That's enough.  Button up .". And got up from the bed. I sat there, not knowing what to do. I quickly buttoned my shirt, got up, trying to look unfazed. He walked me to the door, gave me a peck on the cheek and sent me home.  I didn't cry that night. I was shocked.   That night changed me. I had forgotten all about it until a friend's story in last night chat reminded me of it, and suddenly it all came back - vividly. Ten years later I can say that night is one of the pillars of my sexual self today. For better and for worse.    (For the curious ones - Sagi and I continued to meet, flirt, and kiss every now and then over the years. We never had sex or made out. I haven't heard from him in about 5 years).
