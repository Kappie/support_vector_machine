Sometimes they have handles too, and there are usually LOTS of boxes to be had. Around Fredericton and Oromocto the liquor stores get thier deliveries around noon on Wednesdays, so boxes are usually readily available just after work. I've always found the liquor store workers more than happy to help you load the empty boxes in your vehicle too.  Oh and it's also really fun to haul box after box into your house, each with a different alcoholic beverage advertised on the front, and wonder what the neighbors are thinking.
