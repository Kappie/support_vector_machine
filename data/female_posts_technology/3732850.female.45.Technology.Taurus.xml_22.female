While I am trying to keep busy doing all the things I am suppose to do before our company gets here, my wife is running around like a chicken with her head cut off. It can’t be that hard getting ready to have a little company. There can’t be that much to do. Terry, “Did you scrub the toilets?” “Kids, are your rooms cleaned up” I hear my name being called. What now? What ridiculous thing does she think needs to be done before our company arrives? Like our company is going to look under the beds or something. I hear her, here she comes, “Terry, did you clean up the garage?” Clean up the garage. Are we entertaining in the garage? Why on earth do I need to clean up the garage? I am sure there will be no one going into my garage. And besides, I think it looks pretty darn good. I cleaned it a month or so ago. Besides, how can a garage stay clean if you do any work in it?    The company should be here soon. Do I dare ask if it’s okay for me to take a shower? I can’t shower too early because she will think I don’t have anything to do. I can’t shower too late because she will say I am just messing up the bathroom. Like our company is going to be in our bathroom. Here she comes again. Whew! There she goes! Oh Oh “Terry, would you make sure the kids cleaned up their rooms?” Cleaned up their rooms, they are just going to mess them up again why clean them up?    I think it’s safe to head for the shower. I better not forget to wipe it down when I’m done. You never know, people may get the idea we actually use this bathroom.    I wonder if I dare make some coffee. A good strong cup of coffee sounds good after all that work getting ready for our company. Hmmmm, where do I drink it? Is it to soon to sit down on the couch? There she goes again! She’s been getting ready all day. What could possibly be left to get done? The food must be done because I can smell it cooking. Looks like the table is set. I think it’s safe to sit down and relax a bit before the company arrives. “Terry, is that all you have to do is sit down and drink a cup of coffee? The company’s going to be here any minute.    Ding Dong Ding Dong. Thank goodness they are here, maybe now I can finally have that cup of coffee.
