Write that down!) break into some urban street slang with mumble-mouthed results. That gag has been funny precisely ONE time in the history of cinema, and that was way back in 1980. Having Chinese Granny mumble "fo shizzle mah nozzle" (or whatever) is the surest indication of a screenwriter with more cocaine than talent.  This movie is not only witless and unwatchable; it is a gaping black hole of comedy. Frankly I'm stunned that every American who paid to see it didn't file a class action suit against the now-sorta-defunct Tri-Star Pictures for their blatant misrepresentation of the word "comedy".  The best friend is played by Johnny Knoxville, whose appearance screams "walking punch line" so loud I became tense waiting for him to dive into a pile of elephant feces. Fans of legal drama may want to take note as this film contains the most idiotic courtroom scene in cinema history. Not only does the hero argue his own case and win, he employs some tactics I haven't seen since kindergarten Puppet Theater.  I'm about to devote as much review space to this movie as it deserves:  Pure. Abhorrent. Shit.  And yes; I watched the whole damn thing. How something like this gets released for public consumption makes me want to scream until my colon explodes.  Not until the day that TVs and VCRs come as standard shower features should you ever witness this witless, aimless and altogether awful piece of garbage.  If it seems weird to focus mainly on a film's nudity, it's important to remember that the Skin is the ONLY thing worth seeing in this movie. Were the nudity removed, this film would retain the entertainment value of a used tea bag.  I'd mention a few good supporting actors and a few creepy scenes that do indeed stand out, but they simply don't exist. I began to get the feeling that this was a really long music video that they decided to add dialogue to. (No offense to the word dialogue.)  The 'touching, romantic' scenes between the two principals are so poor and unconvincing, they offer the best laughs in the movie. Rarely can a movie so empty cause such annoyance.  According to the back of the DVD case, this flick has two full paragraphs worth of plot. My guess is that they wrote the DVD case first, and tried (poorly) to follow the synopsis they came up with. All I saw was three naked women rolling around on the floor. Since the word 'vampire' is in the title, the gals occasionally get some syrupy blood splattered all over 'em - and then its back to the simulated cunnilingus.  One quick word about the direction: Bad. Hey, just because you give a tripod a name, that doesn't make it a director.   Granted, they could have called this movie "Free Head!" and I don't think I'd have liked it.  The basic plot of this movie makes Three's Company look like Othello  I hope you don't brand me as over-dramatic, but I'd go out on a limb and say that this movie is quite possibly the dumbest thing to come along since the birth of Anna Nicole Smith.  I've seen bagel mold that offered more originality than this pathetically stupid film.   The action scenes are as plentiful as they are insipid and poorly photographed.        And now for some personal attacks on actors:  Martin Lawrence is not a funny man. Some could construe that comment as opinion, yet I'm as certain of this truth as I am that marijuana smells good. There are varying degrees of funniness, and Lawrence doesn't even approach the outer borders surrounding nearly close to being almost humorous - accidentally or otherwise. This guy is a bloated hack, a shrill and hate-filled fool who entertains only his extended personal posse - and those fools are being paid to laugh.  Note to cameo players:  Cameron--NEVER try to act.  Scorsese----Lay off the medication. Rob Reiner----You wear it, and it rhymes with turtle. Jennifer Tilly---um, nice boobs.  Oh, good God, what did Cindy Williams do to deserve what she's forced to do in this filth? It's uglier than any Faces of Death or Batman sequel out there, and you have to see it to believe it. Her shrill, drunk, screaming ass is all over this horrible movie, and I wonder how close she was to homelessness before signing on for this degradation.  But the true find in this movie is Johnathon Schaech. Actually, his acting talent is tougher to spot here than his name is to spell. But if they ever make a "Barbie  Ken: The Genitalia Experiment" movie, there's your Ken.  No better is the shrill, shrieking, and way over-the-top Kirstie Alley. She is a comedy vacuum, so she fits right in this joyless slop.  Angelina Jolie: She  has nothing sexy to do in this movie, unless you consider getting shot and puking blood everywhere sexy. (Hey, to each his own.) She gives the best performance of the three, although that is like saying that Curly was the most realistic of The Three Stooges.  Salma Hayak does the 'window-dressing' role again and I must say that as an actress, she really has a knack for having large breasts.  Whoever told Ethan Hawke that he could act is a cruel, cruel liar.  Basically, the gore FX seemingly make up only about 1/3 of the makeup in the movie, with the remainder going to cover up the massive Rushmore-esque melon that belongs to Karen Black. I swear - This woman looks like she applies lipstick with a paint roller.   I'm not sure if it's Cuba Gooding who chooses his own scripts, but my guess is this: he keeps every script he's ever been sent and he spreads them out all over the floor of his house. Whichever script his cat craps on first is the movie he opts to star in next.  The most entertaining performance comes from lovely young Mena Suvari, basically because she's just awful. Watching her quivery lips trying to spit out the British inflection is like watching a leech on a hot plate. I'm not saying Suvari is a poor actress; I'm just saying I've never seen her give a good performance.  Freddie Prinze Jr. is unable to portray any emotion that begins or ends in a consonant. You could set Freddie on fire, and I doubt he could adequately convey "something warm".  All reports indicate that Michael Caine signs on for specific films based solely on the catering budget.  When describing skills such as acting talent, skill of timing, and the ability to hold a scene, Claire Danes ranks right above an empty gumball machine and right below Pauly Shore covered with festering scabs.
