I've heard the movie "Anchorman" is really funny, I'd like to see it tonight but I haven't been to a movie alone, well, ever! I don't know what would make me feel more like a reject; sitting at home alone with my cat or sitting in a public movie theatre with a tray of nachos.    Hey did you know that when kids spend hours in front of the TV they grow up to be unhealthy adults? Yeah no kidding, a bunch of scientists had to do research to figure that one out!  urlLink Here's the CBC story . I love the caption under the first picture: "TV advertising tends to promote an unhealthy diet." Way to understate the obvious guys!
