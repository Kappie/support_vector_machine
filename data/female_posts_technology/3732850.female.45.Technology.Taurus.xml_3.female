A cell phone is the greatest thing that they invented you can carry it with you and you’ll never miss a call if that person has your number. If you get stranded somewhere there is not phone to get to right away. One of the problems with having a cell phone is the fact you are always getting calls and driving and some of these people can’t talk on the cell phone and drive at the same time.  Having a regular phone is great to have you don’t have to worry about going over your minutes. You can chose different styles that you want there is the phone that has caller ides and answering machine all in one or just a plan Jane phone. You can get you phones in different shapes you can have Garfield or a shoe for a phone.
