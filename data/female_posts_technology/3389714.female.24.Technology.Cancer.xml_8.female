Well, due to this unprecedented event that took place I decided to make a list of   things that irk me:   Things Women Do That Drive Me Nutz:  1) They wear lipstick outside their lips 2) When anorexic-ly thin women at the gym complain that “I still need to loose 10 pounds”   3) They wear high heels but don’t know how to walk in them 4) They wear pants that ride up their butts   5) They wear a bra that’s 3 sizes too small so it looks as if they have a uni-boob    Things Men Do That Drive Me Nutz:  1) When they try to see who can burp the loudest and longest 2) When they wear their pants so low that we are forced to look at their chunky hairy *sses every time they bend over. 3) When they ask if you had an orgasm after s*x… “Hello, we never do ..we just fake it ..all the bloody time” 4) When they make a puppy dog face and pour fake tears out of their eyes when you inform them that “Yes, your wee wee is a bit too small” 5) When they ask you if  “THEY” are real…”Hello, they are always real…even if they’re fake”  Well here’s my list ..feel free to leave a comment on what drives you nuts:
