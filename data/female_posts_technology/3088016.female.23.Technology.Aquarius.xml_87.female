There were protesters in there calling for him to resign.  What for?  I thought he did a perfect job of defending himself and taking responsibility for something that there's no way he could have ever been truly responsible for.  Some of his opponents pointedly asked if he thought that it would show that the U.S. is serious about the scandal and making sure it stopped.  He admitted that it may, but I disagree.      On the NPR version, you could hear some students in the background chanting something about Rumsfeld resigning.  Where do they find these students?  The ones I know either can't be bothered by politics or they have enough sense not to do something stupid like that.  What about American contractors getting burned alive and hung from bridges?  What about Halliburton employees and soldiers being held hostage on the other side of the world?  I'm hardly incensed by some pictures of naked Iraqis.  These are people who are in the prisons for doing something against our country.  They tried (or succeeded) to kill Americans.  They're people who know what real torture is, and this is not it.
