When I  koff-koff , it sounds phlegm-y, but nothing seems want to get discharge from that very itchy zone. I wish they have those baby-bottle brush, which bristles are soft enough to be lunged through my throat to do some scratch-scratch.  It must be due to the over-gorging of peach sorbet and frozen strawberries  , that I picked up from Cold Storage over the weekend. Plus, I haven't gotten over the fatigueness of attending to mama, the night before. Yes. She had another relapse. This time round was milder. My father happened to be on night shift, so at half past 10pm, I'd received a call from sister who immediately asked me to come down.  When hubby and I arrived, we found mama, resting on the bed and crying. I thought all this while she's a strong fighter. She started to express her feelings that perhaps her time is up.   Listening to the very weaken her, I had to bite myself to not appear weak, and told her to shun that kind of negative thoughts. I suggested to bring her to the doctor, but she repudiated. After much consolation from hubby and myself, finally she obliged.  In the 24-hour clinic  , the doctor put her on nebulizer filled with ventolin. She seems a bit better. It was almost 1am when we sent her home. I made her a hot drink, gave her medicine  , and pat her to sleep. Hubby and I made our way home, while I was thinking of getting off for work in a few hours time. But of course, I faltered.  Earlier during the day, the planned JB trip was off. No need to go and peep-peep. I think it was on the news that both sides were jammed. So good, homely wife decided to cook whatever's left in the fridge, and she came out with Ayam Masak Merah and Chap Chye. 'Bad', unhomely hubby, 'abandoned' his good, homely wife, to check on his engine and water-tank stuffs, and met up his friends for awhile. But before ND parade started, he came back for her and they shared a pleasant meal together while watching TV.  So, this is the story of my 2004 National Day. Ok, time for my 2nd dosage of meds (Yucks!). Am thinking of putting up Arisan on the VCD player, later. Ehhh, did I tell you all, that School Of Rock, really RAWKS?
