It says:            For August 17: Mars and Mercury heighten your desire for change and variety, particularly in your residence. What worked in the past may no longer reflect your ephemeral needs and desires. Excess energy, excitement or tension makes healthy physical exercise a necessity today. Without some form of exercise, your mind may never calm down. On another front, you’re ready to invest in your future – and your future may involve property. You’re also eager to break tradition and defy the odds. Is it any wonder that others find you so exciting?     urlLink             My mother is very into astrology, and I've found that many times it's right on target - your sign, your numbers, it really does define who you are.  Anyways, I feel like I am in need of a change, but to what? My mind is racing. It's very busy, but busy with stuff that I can't even decide is important.  Oh, well, enough of the self-involvement. I don't have enough patience to look inside myself and try to figure out what's going on.  I have different topics I want to cover. I skip back and forth between interesting ideas, tagging them with a "blog that one later" flag. However, when I get to the blog, I forget the ideas...isn't that the way it always is?  My next few posts will cover such topics as:     ..An amateur's thoughts on astrology   ..Conservaliberals ..Why men and women are equals   ..There is a God
