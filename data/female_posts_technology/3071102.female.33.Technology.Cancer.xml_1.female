But of course, as always, it brought a profound smile on my face, as it always does...  And it can't be bad if I am not doing it EVERY DAY right? Yes, I went to see my absolute, all-time favorite blues musician-Sean Costello. First, he's perfectly adorable. Second, he's a hell of a singer and guitar player. Third, he always seems like he is singing JUST for you. It was funny, one of his new songs I just totally related to... something to the affect of "you loved me, when I didn't love you"  And of course, being in NST, listening to Sean and having him sing a song where a fella is using a woman for her money so that he can go play with other women totally reminded me of last summer's experience with my SCHMUCK. I think that I am in a VERY good space/place away from that entire experience... although sometimes I reminisc a little too much... to which I quickly say "BAD HABIT".  Sometimes I say it aloud just to be very firm with myself... my crutch, my negativity, my anger that I came away from that with sometimes overwhelms me and takes away any good outlook on life. But back to Sean... I didn't stay too long.  I always have a good time when I go, but as usual, I was by myself and just wasn't feeling like being out, and being alone.   I got to talk a little with the band... no, not to SEAN, the band.  I can't seem to make myself even say hi to the man, I am not sure why.  But, when he is on the stage... I can't take my eyes off of him. I will definitely be in line for the new cd!
