The wedding was ok, my hands were shaking so bad yesterday that I gave up on trying to eat. From there we went to Gilhoolies to see Acoustically challenged for a bit.  Was so tired I felt like I was gonna fall over.  I miss Collen so much. He has been in Indiana since Thurs. He is getting home at 4 and he is leaving at 5 to go w/ Sean. My baby doll. I hate being w/ out him for too long. I have w/ drawls. LOL He is my life ya know? Going out w/ Marcella tonight. We will have a blast I can already feel it. Ok that is enough for now. I will post the wedding pics as soon as I get the disc back. Laterz
 6 MORE DAYS TILL WALT DISNEY WORLD!
