I found it interesting how at first, the author referred to the prisoner as "a puny wisp of a man, with a shaven head and vague liquid eyes." It was if the author had to somehow justifying they were doing, by finding some negative qualities in the prisoner. The author never did state what the prisoners crime had been.   As the Essay unfolded, the author began to realize that not only was this a prisoner, but he was also a human being with feelings, just like his own. For example, when the author stated,"Once, in spite of the men who gripped him by each shoulder, he stepped lightly aside to avoid a puddle on the path. It is curious; but till that moment I had never realized what it means to destroy a healthy, conscious man. When I saw the prisoner step aside to avoid the puddle, I saw the mystery, the unspeakable wrongness, of cutting a life short when it is in full tide."  It seemed that all of the people involved in the hanging had become desensitized to what they were doing. I think that the dog that showed up threw them all off guard because the dog was so innocent and unaware of what was going on. I think the dog symbolized the reality of what they were actually doing.  Even the superintendent, also the doctor, had a hard time declaring the man "dead". He only said, "He's all right." I assumed he could not say the word dead because then he would have to take some responsibility for his death.   I think this essay was about the author realizing that these prisoners were human beings, just like himself and what they were doing was not acceptable. He also found himself questioning how quickly life returned to normal as they got further away from where the hanging had taken place.
