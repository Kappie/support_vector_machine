You can 'engine-search' the many uses of your bottle of Heinz.       (From left)A bottle of the 'Wonderful' Dr Apple's Apple Cider Vinegar(550ml), A bottle of natural 'Multi Floral' Honey(1.5kg) to compliment the 'wonderfulness' taste of the vinegar, 'Them' awaiting for me to consume *yikes!*   FYI, the price of the vinegar plus the honey is 35 dollars. Hubby ring-ring a certain hotline number to place order. And the fellow will deliver right to your doorstep. But there is a minimum quantity posed.   A bottle of vinegar plus a bottle of honey should last me for a month with once per daily consumption. But with the rate I am going (skipping, mixing in very little vinegar), it might take me months. Mas, perhaps you want to share, my share.
