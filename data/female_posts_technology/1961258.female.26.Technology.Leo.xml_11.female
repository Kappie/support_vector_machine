I don't want to do that, I know that I just need to exercise and watch (a little) of what I eat. She is right about one thing though .. and that is cutting out sugars, sweets. So .. I told her, instead of buying those things for me (which would never work, we're talking infomercials here) .. give me the money at the end of a certain period if I hit a certain weight. So we agreed, that by my 26th birthday at the end of July, if I'm 150lbs .. I win a reward from her which is about $500. If not, I have to give $500 to her. It's not a huge amount and I don't need the money but it's something .. for someone like me who has absolutely no motivation at all. I needed a challenge .. so here it is. This is going to be an interesting 4 months/16 weeks .. I think I can hit 150lbs by the end of June, 1lbs per week (3,500 calories less per week, 500 calories less per day).   My plan 1. Sleep every night - 1 to 2 am latest 2. Wake up - 9 - 10am 3. Workout (am) once you wake up (10 min, 20 min, 30 min .. whatever, just workout .. cardio preferable) 4. Breakfast - after workout (before 11am), complete breakfast .. cereal, milk, fruit 5. Lunch - as usual  6. Snacks - 1 or 2 'bad' items only, as a reward. Protein shakes. Fruits. 7. Workout (pm) - toning if done cardio in morning (arms, legs .. alternate every day) 8. Dinner - BEFORE 7 or 8pm. Absolutely nothing after that time.  9. Cut out the constant chips  chocs, no more goodie drawer to fill up every time you go out.  10. Go by the fit of your clothes NOT the weight on the scale. Only step on it once a week.   Wish me luck!
