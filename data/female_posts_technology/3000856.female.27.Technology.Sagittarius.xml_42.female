Normally not a problem unless you have to be up 3 hrs later! Oh man am I feeling it today.  A can of worms were opened last night not purposely but they were and now I am dealing w/ that.  On the way home Jake said he was supposed to relay a message from someone, but did not want me to be upset.  Of course at that point I made him tell me.  Apparently he talked to Shannon and told her about the new band situation and she was really excited for me.  She told Jake to tell me congratulations.  At first it did not even phase me, but now..... Just replaying a bunch of bull shit in my head over and over.  Why? As soon as I feel I am doing better...... WHAMO! An emotional roller coaster all over again.  It's not Jakes fault. As far as he is concerned none of this is bothering me! BUT WE KNOW DIFFERENTLY DON'T WE? If I could just talk to her and I could get everything out there.  This has been such a mind fuck! The ball is in her court! I guess she is moving forward w/ the plans for the wedding.  I was supposed to be in that wedding, she asked me to sing in that wedding too.  Amazing how fast you can loose someone that is so important to you.  She came out of nowhere, and faded into the dark w/ out a trace. Maybe there was a purpose for us meeting.  Have not figured that part out yet. Maybe we met at the wrong time. I miss our friendship. As long as she is in the band w/ Vic it is a lost cause.  She won't jeopardize that. I really hope all goes well for her. I still miss her....
