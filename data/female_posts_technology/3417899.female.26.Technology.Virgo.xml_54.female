I have  urlLink vented   and  urlLink cursed   to anyone that was willing (or unwilling) to listen. I've probably spent more nights in my husband arms complaining of Harry than I have making love (oh well, that's  urlLink not really an accomplishment , is it?)  Anyway - "Harry" is gone. Booted. Shown the door. Kicked out. Fired. (Well, to be accurate, he doesn't actually know yet - but the decision has been made. You, dear readers, have the inside scoop!).   Can you say "YAY!!!!!" ?
