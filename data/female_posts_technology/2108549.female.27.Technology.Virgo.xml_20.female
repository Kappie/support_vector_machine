I'm overly sensitive now (yes, more so than usual) and I'm hoping sleep tonight takes care of it.  It wasn't a bad day, actually it was pretty good.  Just busy.  Looking forward to hanging out with a friend tomorrow afternon.  Saturday is SF with Ju to see the Chagall exhibit and Sunday is getting ready for Monday.  :)
