Sick of people who don't do jack and get paid, sick of working and not getting recognized, sick of work politics, sick of mis-managment. damn, here i go again. okay, just read my previous post. i'm not going to dwell on them.  today is catchup for me. bills to pay, people to call, movies to catch up on, and internet. awesome day it will be.  definitely, i'm signing up for GRE and CBEST today. thats about $100 for both, i think.  got paid yesterday. damn, paid all my bills due this week and i still got money left over.. i double checked it. can't believe it. it better not come back and slap me in the ass.
