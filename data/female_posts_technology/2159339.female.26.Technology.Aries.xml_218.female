Their guitarist Golden Gram is one of the lucky few in my framed rock stars collection. I still don’t know what color to paint the frame though. The point of this is that they’re good. They just got signed to Subpop and they prove that the SF scene is not only alive, but flourishing.  Bart Davenport can do no wrong. He’s my main man and I always have a good time when he’s around. He’s a chameleon and in last night’s guise he was a hippie. He assembled a band this time around, but it was not the same band as the rockin hip-hoppin funkjam band Abby and I saw ages ago at Bottom of the Hill and Amoeba. I didn’t recognize anyone in his band and I’ve seen him in two other band-type incarnations. He didn’t wear his aviator sunglasses and satiny members only jacket. He wore a hippie peasant shirt and bellbottoms and the people in his band wore the same.  Many words are tossed around about Bart--dismissive encapsulating words such as “California”, “singer-songwriter”, “retro”, “Eagles”, “Jackson Browne”, “James Taylor”, “70s”, but to me, he is a slice of heaven, if heaven was a pie filled with local songsters. My parents came to America in 1975, so I grew up in a bubble of Mozart symphonies and Vietnamese folk songs. My mind wasn’t marinated in the American collective consciousness, so I can’t classify BartD as a throwback to some other era. To me, I’m hearing beautiful new music and it’s special and wonderful and makes me happy. He’s so great that I paid no mind to his hippie gear. Anyone else would be ridiculed to no end, but Bart is excused because he exists on a higher plane.   I’ve seen him seven times now, and I hope to see him 7x7 more times. I love him!  Kelly Stoltz was the headliner and I’d seen him once before at Thee Parkside during his residency there. Back then, W-gal and I only stayed for a couple songs because we were tired, but I left really impressed. He’s a talented and experienced musician and I remember thinking: Elvis Costello. It’s rockin pop delivered by a scruffy guy. This time around I was excited to stay longer and enjoy his set, but after 7-8 songs, my excitement petered out. Though the songs are good, and he’s a great performer, he doesn’t have that magnetism that makes me want to stay til the end, buy his CDs, and put his picture into a frame. W-gal and R-dude were with me on this. So we all headed home before the show ended.
