On Saturday I bought a new down comforter for my bed.  It is so nice and warm and cozy.  So this morning, despite the garbage truck waking me up as it does every Monday morning, I was so warm and cozy that I really, really did not want to get out of bed.  All I felt like doing was snuggling a little deeper into my fluffy comforter and going back to sleep.  Why is it that beds are most comfortable when you have to get up?
