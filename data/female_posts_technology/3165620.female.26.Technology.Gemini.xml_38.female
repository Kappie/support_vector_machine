I got the maps to print off tonight and stuffed them in the envelopes with the invitations. I'll be mailing off 32 invitations with a maximum guest count of 63. Of course, some of these people probably won't be able to come, and it is quite possible that we'll sheepishly realize we forgot someone and fire off a delayed invitation or two, but the bulk of it is taken care of. I just need to seal them and get them posted.  I'm starting to think this might just work out!
