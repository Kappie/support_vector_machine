WOW this was the longest week.  I have no children this weekend, and though I'm very excited about that, I was all teary-eyed driving away to work this morning with no one in the backseat.    Heading out to celebrate Susie's move to TX, then running to the mall to pick up a cute outfit for the trip, date with my Italian Stallion, home to pack (of COURSE I haven't planned ahead) sleep a few hours and then at 6am I'm on my way to the airport for Chicago!!!  I'll post pic's when I return.  Can't wait!  Off to cram about a week's worth of work into about 2 hours.  My positive motivational thought for the day:
