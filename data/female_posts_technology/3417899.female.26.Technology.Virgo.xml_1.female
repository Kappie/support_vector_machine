He is obnoxious. He is annoying. He is scattered. He is... well...  repulsive.   I feel bad for him. He has a sweet 2 year old daughter and a wife that moved all the way to this city for him to take this job.  He's really trying to be good. Making an effort.  But every meeting with him is a disaster.  Every customer... I can tell... is "rubbed the wrong way" by Harry.   I know he feels uncofmortable with having a 26 year old as his boss (He is in his late thirties). I know he doesn't like working with someone who has less experience in the industry then he does (heck, when he was already working as an SE I was barely in high school).  So he disrespects me. And he dislikes me. And he makes sure that's known.   But I am the one in charge. I get to decide his future. My word is valued and if I say he's gone - the he's gone.  (In the army, a commander can chose who will "carry his weapons", who he trusts. In the sales team, a sales executive can chose their SE).   I feel bad for Harry - I know he might not deserve this. But he's got to go. I can't work him.  Four months is a long time to give someone "a shot"... right?   Right?
