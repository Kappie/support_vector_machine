Other; 12.6% (6 others nominated, 1 vote each).  Others, voted for in this order; ~ Saddam  ~ To be determined by people of Iraq ~ The people of Irak ~ Emigre (no, i didn't vote for myself, someone else did, thankyou anonymous voter). ~ Constitutional Monarchy ~ Raed  Total Votes over five days; 48 Num visitors over five days; 625 Record number of votes in one day; 23 (Thurs 10.06.2004)  The Hypothetical Webloggers Council lead with 100% of the vote in the initial stages, till I spilled the beans in order to rack up a few more voters. If the silent majority had stayed silent I suspect the Webloggers Council would have won by an even greater margin then they did.  Conclusion; just over half of Iraq Blog Count readers, at least the ones that can be bothered to move a mouse for the sake of el'cheapo poll games, have more faith in a hypothetical party then they do in the existing Interim Govt. Faith in the CPA? pffft, say no more.    The other options are revealing, if at times a little odd.   I think  urlLink Raed  needs to start a political party now, or at least consider standing as an independent. If he can get 2.2% of the vote on an undervisited weblog in an election he never even campaigned for - Raed, i see a future...   Btw, in case you're wondering, I voted for the Webloggers Council.
