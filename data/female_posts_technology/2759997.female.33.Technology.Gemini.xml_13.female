Pick up a paper and grab a cup of coffee at Starbuck's (I know, I could get the paper delivered and make my own coffee -- and I used to -- but that led to me not making myself presentable until late in the day, as well as encouraging me to drink an entire pot of coffee...).  Read paper, cut out coupons, glance at an ad or two.  Make a mimosa and tackle the LA Times crossword puzzle.  Consider meeting someone for brunch, or being productive, or officially starting my day.  Or maybe take on the NY Times puzzle and another mimosa...  Today is NOT my typical Sunday.
