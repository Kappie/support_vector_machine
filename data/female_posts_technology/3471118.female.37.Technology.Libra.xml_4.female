Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you. 16 You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit--fruit that will last. Then the Father will give you whatever you ask in my name.  17 This is my command: Love each other.  18 If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. 19 If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you. 20 Remember the words I spoke to you: 'No servant is greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also. 21 They will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not know the One who sent me. 22 If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin. Now, however, they have no excuse for their sin. 23 He who hates me hates my Father as well. 24 If I had not done among them what no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. But now they have seen these miracles, and yet they have hated both me and my Father.   Longer than usual because I'm catching up on two days worth.  Again, I've gotten behind, and away from doing this on a daily basis.  I want to keep up with that.  Even in just the 31 days I did it with the church verses, going back and reading them over has helped me at times.  We aren't just serving God -- we have a relationship with him where he has let us in on the "secrets" of life.  He's chosen us to do his works, specifically to spread his word to other people and try to bring them closer to him.  If we do this, God will listen to our prayers and help us out when we need it.  All we have to do is love each other.  There's going to be opposition to us, even hatred of us, because we are Christians.  That's the same as it was when Jesus was here -- they hated him too.  We aren't owned by the world, we belong to God, so the world doesn't understand us and therefore might hate us.  (I don't think this is a given in general, just a possibility we have to be prepared for.)  The world isn't going to treat us any better than it treated Jesus, and we have to be ready to deal with that.  But in the same way, people in the world might listen to what we have to say -- like me listening to Bobby and the pastors and learning about Christianity.  However they respond to you, it will be because of Jesus, and because these people don't know God.  And if they continue to not know God, it won't be (and shouldn't be) because no one told them about him.  We should give them the opportunity to know him, but with that also comes responsibility if they continue to choose not to know him.  That sounds so harsh.  But I guess it's true.  I don't ever want to come off sounding holier-than-thou, though.  "Well, if you don't believe in God, it's your own fault when you die and go to hell!"  What a horrible way to approach things with people!  I understand the concept here.  But if I were ever going to tell anyone about God and Jesus, I would really not want it to be that way.  Maybe that is the truth, and maybe it will be the end result, and maybe they do need to hear that and realize it.  But it's not exactly a good way to get people to come over to this side, you know?
