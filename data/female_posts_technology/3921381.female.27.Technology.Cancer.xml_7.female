IT WAS ALL FUCKING MISMANAGEMENT!! who has the flipping education here? who is more professional and more experienced in the workfield? ME!   first of all , i'm not upset she's getting more than me. i only say those things because its part of another issue at my workplace. i'm upset she's at the same address as me. She is crazy! i mean empty inside but filled with evil thoughts crazy.   identity thief. she wants to be like me. she took all my previous jobs after i've been promoted. she emails me with sexual harrasment. she spreads rumors about me. she called my husband and told him i was fucking someone. she wants to take me down because i am better and she'll never get to happiness like me.  best part, she's commented on how nice my ass is and she is a bisexual. she really WANTS me but since she can't have me, she'll rest on stalking me.   and i'm not a lesbian.   she likes to chew revlon nail polish and thinks of the perfect crime on raining weekends. this is why i'm so afraid she'll do something to my car or house.   damn mismanagment. they hired her because the other person (who is well educated ) was not on their "In-Crowd" list.
