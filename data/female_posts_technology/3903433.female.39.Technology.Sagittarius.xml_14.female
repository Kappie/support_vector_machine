So we're taking the day off to trim some branches and trees to prepare.  I was at a networking luncheon and someone said she was surprised they didn't name the "C" storm Clyde... :P If they'd done that, and the timing/positioning of Bonnie had been a little different, why, we'd have the Perfect Storm. :)  The supermarkets must have anticipated a run; I was surprised to walk into Publix and find there were still canned goods available. I had a hurricane store but it was a bit old, and one can exploded some time ago so I thought now was a good time to replace it. The other thing I've been mulling over was a supplier like Survival Instinct for longer term food storage and water filters.  At a time like this, I wish we'd been able to build our dome home.
