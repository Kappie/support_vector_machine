Here's what they made:  *Oysters-- they stuffed spinach, prosciutto, and breadcrumbs into the shells and baked them! *Polenta--they grilled polenta rounds and served it with a creamy cheese sauce that was nice and stinky. Gruyere? Gorgonzola? *Grilled Asparagus *Pasta--they made a gigantic vat of fettucine and served it with soft plump pieces of chicken, a chunky tomato sauce, and shredded fresh basil. There was more ingredients, but the lighting was dim so I couldn't really see. *Garlic bread *Dessert--Homemade lemon cheesecake cupcakes. My little cousin K-chef just graduated from Brown and we're all urging her to take the plunge and go to culinary school. Her presentation yesterday night was full of whimsy: she arranged polenta rounds into the shape of a flower and for the cakes she topped each with a single cherry and arranged them around a clear bowl of nilla wafers.   They also served my current white wine obsession: Muscat! Other  urlLink dessert wines  I want to try: Riesling, Gew√ºrztraminer, Sauternes.  (I brought XX along and he did a minimum of complaining/whining. He even helped shuck the oysters. He says he wants to move down to L.A. eventually and this makes me sad sometimes. But other times I feel completely indifferent and think,"Good riddance, you stupid clown." It's because sometimes the man is impossible. But mostly he's nice. I'm divided. The ratio is 63% nice, 37% impossible.)
