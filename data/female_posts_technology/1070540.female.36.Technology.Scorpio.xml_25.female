I didnt think my husband would mind.  I thought it would relax me. We got the drink and then went and got the percing.  WEll husband did mind. I screwed up my marriage and I am not sure if I can fix it.  My heart hurts, my neck hurts, my throat hurts. My nipples hurt.  I was told last night I was a bitch ,.  Well I guess I am....I was told I was like Stacey. That hurt me more than anything.  I try to make sure he has everything he needs and some of what he wants.  I didnt realize I was such a bad person, but I do know now.  I was told I was having an affair.  He said with my ex husband.  That is the grossest thing that I have ever heard.  If that man ever touched me again I would cut off his dick..cut off his hand and place the dick in it.  I was the scaredest I have ever been last night, why? becuase I let a drink come between my husband and me.  It didnt scare me that I was held down.  hurt like hell, not breathing is scary but I must of deserved it.  Just like I told Misty, he wouldnt hurt me without a reason cause he loves me.    I will never go to a family function again.  Cause all knows.   I wont tell them I made him so mad that he held me down by the throat, that is embarrassing,(I didnt mean for that to happen) I wish the bruises on my neck were not there, and the scratches on my face cause I dont want anyone to know.  His mom must of told maw-maw,  cause now she is calling.  I guess everyone thinks I am Stacey now.  Is there need to stay in this family? Yes there is, because I love him.  But I will NEVER go to family functions again. cause NOW I know that I will be treated as Stacey and I am no stacey.  I gucked up one night.  I have to go get my house in order.  I wont have time ever again to sit down and type. So I say GOODBYE to everyone.
