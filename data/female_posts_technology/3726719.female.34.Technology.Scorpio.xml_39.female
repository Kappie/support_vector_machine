It's another hot summer day in Nashville.   Last night was very low key.  My only blonde moment was getting distracted by the Rob Schneider movie "The Animal."   :o)   I am proud to report that I made the last payment on a credit card account yesterday.  Glad to have that gone.  Anxious to get the others done away with.  I did a free credit check last night.  The score has  come up a bit since the debacle surrounding the house purchase.  There were a few things that needed to be disputed.  All in all it wasn't too bad.  I'm borrowing the movie Mystic River from my friend Marsha.  Will probably watch it tonight.   My hip is sore today.  It doesn't feel any worse - it just doesn't feel any better.  I did a lot of stretching last night, and wore my shoes with heel lift all night around the house.  Think I'm going to have to break down and go see another doc about it.  I was hoping to be back in exercise action this weekend, so looks like I'll continue to take it easy there.  Other than that, not much to report.  I still haven't gotten past the first chapter of Messenger by Lois Lowry.   And I still haven't picked up the Asimov BOT that's waiting for me at the library.   I'll definitely have entertainment options for the weekend.
