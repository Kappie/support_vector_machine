McKinney Barbie aspires to become Plano Barbie. Not cheap, but still very naive.    College Station Barbie      Into football, animals and bonfires. 98% belong to a cult, 2% are free thinking and void of any "traditions." Does nothing but complain about Austin Barbie.    West Dallas Barbie     This Spanish-speaking-only Barbie comes with a 1984 Toyota with expired temporary plates and three babies in the back, without car seats. This is the only Barbie willing to do manual labor. Ken comes in a meat-packer's uniform and is missing three fingers on his left hand. Green cards are not yet available for West Dallas Barbie or Ken. Available at Carnival Stores only.    Austin Barbie/ken     This versatile doll can be easily converted from Barbie to Ken by simply adding or subtracting the "snap-on" parts. Likes to "experiment".
