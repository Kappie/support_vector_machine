At this time also you will see more giant-red-candles, money-paper-burning, red-pails-with-goodies-on-auctions around. And of course after this, comes the merriment of the Lantern/Mooncake Festival *i loike*.  During this season, indeed my company operates in 'sheer madness', but everybody seems to avoid working late nights in office. Its 'taboo-ish'; they believe spirits roaming around this place during the 7th Month *goosebumps*.  urlLink     Even though for that fact, there were inevitable times I had to work late *alone*. Normally, I shall plugged in my Creative speakers to my CD player, and blasted the music off *really* loud. Without that 'noise', seriously it's 'dead' silent and 'frustating' sounds coming from some nooks. Why I call it frustating? Because one night, frustatingly I was 'desperate' to know the source of the 'frustating' sounds. And it's frustating to find it's the FAX MACHINE  urlLink    'soft-peep-peep-teet-teet' sounds.  So, then onwards, I eliminate the feeling of fear to stay-back in the office alone.  Talking about ghost-ghost, I feel like putting my eyes on that movie 'PHSM'. Errrrr ... you people figure out larrr. I find the title too un-nice to be typewritten here. My karma tells me it's worth to catch because it's director's name is Shuhaimi Baba.   One strange thing, hubby has been bugging me to catch another ghost-ghost on cinema, The Sisters. It must be the low-seasons of good shows running, that he has to suggest his most unfavorite theme. Well mat-labah-labah  urlLink    and hairy-potek  urlLink    still running, yet he insists to wait on the DVD.   Next thing, I want to check my tix stubs, what's our last movie? Fifty First Dates?! May Fifteenth Two Thousand Four! That's been two months!
