Normally I use colds as an excuse to take a day or two of work off to catch up on my sleep (and daytime TV), but between the move and work getting busy I just can't afford the day off.  As for the move, Jon and I are settling in to our new digs. I like the neighborhood more than our last; it's much more quiet and I still haven't spotted a couch on any one's porch. One of our neighbors came by yesterday, introduced herself, and gave us some home-made cookies.  Mmmmmm. Chocolate chip.  We are trying to rent/sell our old house. We have had quite a few calls on it all ready; I am amused as to how many of the calls involved the words "owner financed" and "H.U.D.". I hope we sell, otherwise I'm going to feel like a slumlord.  This morning it was below freezing. I didn't have to go out and start the car early because now we have a 2 car garage. *Heh* I guess I'm officially middle-class now.  We haven't gone to the gym this week. We are planning to go tomorrow. We'll see how that goes; with this darn chest cold I will probably do a light stroll for aerobic activity.  After mentioning Gladiator last post, I was amused to note it was on broadcast TV Monday night. Cut to ribbons, of course. I get a giggle when the crowds start chanting "Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!" because I used to have a Fighter in Dungeons and Dragons whose name was Gluteus Maximus. Hey, to a 17 year-old stoner that was funny!  There was the Paladin Sodium Pentathol, The Druid Alluvial Till, Fundus the Ovarian, the High Priest of the Ithsmus of Ramus (that one wasn't mine but I was duly impressed)....  Sorry. 70's flashbacks can be painful.  Okay, in the "funny to a 17 year-old stoner" department: go to  urlLink this fellow's site  and view some of his work. Particularly the Moon Song. Silly, no? Some of his work just showed up in a Quizno's Sub commercial. Warning: Sound is involved!  His most famous clip involved  urlLink the Viking Kittens . Not only is it a hoot, you will finally learn the lyrics to Led Zeppelin's the Immigrant Song.
