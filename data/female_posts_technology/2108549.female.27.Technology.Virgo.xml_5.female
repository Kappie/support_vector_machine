The phone is gonna be turned off tomorrow night, the drapes drawn and if Freedom wants to stay he is gonna have to snooze with me.  Although I doubt that will be a problem.  I have thrown the poor boy into a tizzy this week with getting up so early.   I'm trying to find that balance between all work and no play and all play and no work.  I'm hoping that once my body settles into the routine, the mind will follow. I've been eating a lot healthier this week and somehow I think that is making it worse.  *sigh*  I know.... its a process.
