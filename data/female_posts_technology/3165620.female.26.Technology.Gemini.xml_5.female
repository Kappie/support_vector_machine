Not bad, but I'm not sure if it looked quite right on me.  urlLink http://www1.davidsbridal.com/bridalgowns_detail.jsp?stid=380=4  There is a second dress at David's that I also noted for consideration, but they don't seem to have it on the website, so no picture.  I tried this one on (in white) at a nice, friendly little shop. The only one they had was huge, so I was pinned into it to get an idea of how it would look. It's hard to get a good view of this dress with the model sitting so oddly.  urlLink http://www.jordanfashions.com/products.asp?nCatID=1=237=3457
