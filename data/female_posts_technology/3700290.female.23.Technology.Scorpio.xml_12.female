Though no one had exactly pinpointed that I was at fault, but from what vijaya's voice..I detected sarcasm which I believed was directed to me. I knew that I was partially at fault so I was pretty downcasted.  Hoping to seek some comfort from someone, I called JH yesterday during the meal break.In the end, I did not manage to bring this matter up to her as we were too busy rattling about the cliche gossipy topic...BGR. This lucky girl always have tons of romance whirls, highly-eligible bachelors under her skirt...We talked for an hour or so and it managed to uplift my spirits. It was that moment that I had the long-lost feeling of feeling how good it was to have friends to bitch about topics that do not revolve around work at least for a moment!  As I came into the office today, I surfed into her blog. I was surprised that she did not mention a lot of things to me in our conversation yesterday. Perhaps all female species are supposed to be emotionally complex creatures. Perhaps it was something to do with her work so she did not say it out...  Nevertheless after reading her blog, I am re-enforced with the fact that I should cherish what I have. I do have a loving family...a stable (though not perfect) job, a bunch of loyal friends that I could count on when I need companionship. And last but not least, my studies..which I think till now suffer no much hiccups along the way...Perhaps the one thing that I am lacked of most now is LOVE. Love that can grow into companionship that can endure sufferings and have fun, which could lead to long-term compatibility. I know what I am lacked of but I am not actively seek for it. I guess my viewing of heart affairs still remains the same over the years: if it is yours, it will come to you...I believe in fate and destiny. Perhaps the ONE for me has not arrived.However, someone dear has reminded me of the fact that I should put in enough efforts to maintain the relationship if it comes...at the right time. Thanks, Linda...
