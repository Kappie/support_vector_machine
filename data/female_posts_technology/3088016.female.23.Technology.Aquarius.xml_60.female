I have shown up and been visited by the following searches lately:       "weight watchers"+"ice cream cake"+"points"+"baskin robbins"      public restroom signs templates      www.hello.com      brazilian contractors members guestbook 2004      dangers of popcorn butter fumes   Most of the time the words almost all come from different posts, but the search returns my URL because they all appear at least once.   urlLink Kelly 's theory is that he doesn't want a site meter because if he actually knew how few people were reading he would lose interest.  To the contrary, I guess that knowing I'm being visited at all and that I actually have one or two regulars is what keeps me interested in writing.
