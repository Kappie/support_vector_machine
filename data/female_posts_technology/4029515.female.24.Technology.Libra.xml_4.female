Been indulging in a movie binge these couple of days,due to excessive time on hands(refer "hello world").  Watched a total of 5.33 movies(watched only 1/3 of Troy) in 3 days.Which averages pretty high for me.Jersy girl was so-so.Thought they'd done a good job in picking the little girl that resembles JLo to play her daughter.She does a pretty good imitation of her mother's jerk-neck-arguing.  Shrek 2 - one word, excellent.Loved "puz" <pause>"in boots"... Watched this other feel-good movie "Mrs.Winterbourne"...I know I know..There's nothing spetacular abt it at all.Just a regular boy-meet-girl.Got it solely because of Brendan Fraser.Forgive me father...for I have sinned!
