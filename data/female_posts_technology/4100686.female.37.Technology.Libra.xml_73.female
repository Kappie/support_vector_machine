Well, where i am winter is on its way around, so the earth is probably showing itself towards summer in Iraq. Long days to short and short to long, refreshing to think of an axis in terms of that spindle upon which our globe spins. I could lip-synch Stevie Wonders "world, keep on turning..." but am going to torture anyone reading with another Ben Harper song instead...  She's Only Happy in the Sun  I know you may not  want to see me on your way down  from the clouds  Would you hear me if i told you that my heart is with you now  She's only happy in the sun she's only happy  in the sun  Did you find  what you were after the pain and the laughter bought you to your knees  But if the sun sets you free sets you free you'll be free indeed  She's only happy in the sun she's only happy  in the sun  Everytime i hear you laughing I hear you laughing it makes me cry  Like the story of life of life is hello goodbye  She's only happy in the sun she's only happy in the sun  She's only happy in the sun she's only happy in the sun  (actually, she is just as happy in the rain, when the seasons change).
