I was a baby today about it when I did not find it and the post-it on my desk nor on the three places I was at this morning.  I rummage my bag while saying  Asan ka na?   I seriously felt like crying.   Kabibili ko lang kaya ng ballpen this morning!   20 pesos  pa ang ginastos ko and out of my small baon.   Aargh!  Finally, after looking around our room I found it lying there all tidy in front of another pc.   Sino ang salarin?   Definitely not me.
