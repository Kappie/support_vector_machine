The so called 5 core values of the company. Well, I suddenly thought of my mom, who definitely have all these values and much more.. If she only had the chance to work in the corporate world, boy, she would have shone like the north star in a black night. I'm not half what she is. I don't think I'll ever be, either. She's got guts, and lots of heart. I sure miss her today.. but yay!! I'm going back this weekend to see her!!!! :)
