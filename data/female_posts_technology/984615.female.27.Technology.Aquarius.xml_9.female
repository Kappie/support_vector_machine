Someday I might just get the point and see that ranting about all this hullabaloo isn't going to do me any good other than to just allow me to vent some of my many pent up frustrations at the world, and my complete lack of understanding as to why it has to all turn out this way.  I suppose that it all started when i was a little girl....
