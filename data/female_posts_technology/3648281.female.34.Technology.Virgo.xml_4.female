I have thought about you everyday since we last talked. You have the strangest effect on me...  I'm stuck in time. You sitting on my couch with me lying across your lap. Your hands were on me. My eyes were closed I was taking in your voice. We had someplace to be but if I had known what was to come I would have stayed and made the most every minute of my time with you. If I close my eyes I can go back there to that night.   You said you have been dreaming about me. I dream about you too. It's a yearning really. I'm not sure why you wanted to tell me. You said you were doing ok. You didn't offer anything else and I didn't ask anymore.  Are you still sure you made the right decision? I am angry at myself for walking away that day. I was scared and I didn't know what else to do. It was defense. Are you happy now?   I didn't see it then but I do clearly now. You are my soul mate. You are "the one" I did not then and I let the opportunity pass. The other half of me will roam the earth trying to figure out how I let you go until the end of time...
