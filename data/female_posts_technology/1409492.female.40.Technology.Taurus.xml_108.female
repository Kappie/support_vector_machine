Well, I'm happy. Anyway, the movie was stupid. Stupid stupid stupid. But I suspect that the last 30 minutes has Los Angeles sliding off into the ocean, so that will be fun. TiVo rules, even if it seems to be recording every single episode of  Cops  with a scary sort of monomania.  No stupid animals tried to commit suicide yesterday. What a relief.
