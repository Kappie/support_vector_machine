It's as quick and as simple as dragging and dropping files.   To download Hello and get started sharing photos, click on this picture, or go directly to our  urlLink sign up page .  You'll be able to select a username and password, and before you know it (it takes about 30 seconds to download), you'll be sending and receiving pictures too.  You can learn more at  urlLink www.hello.com .                          (are you still using email to share pictures?)
