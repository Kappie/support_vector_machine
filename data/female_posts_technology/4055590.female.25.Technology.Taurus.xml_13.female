Then it came back in at like 3am this morning (and no I wasn't drinking last nig    ht) -  now it is gone, again. Today it is 9am and it is like that last good n'sync song,... "GONE"!! Any suggestion? I do not want to hear "Go to the doctor".I feel like I am a mute, but I dont know it yet. Becuase you all know I can't shut up if my life depeneded on it. HELP HELP HELP! I have to take tylenol in order to eat in less pain!!! Help Help Help!!!
