He was on his honeymoon with new wife Courtney when we wreaked havoc on his abode and literally filled the entire bedroom, floor to ceiling, back to front, with balloons.  Pictures can be found  urlLink in their gallery  at  urlLink www.matandcourtney.com .  It's been 18 months since I installed my first DVD burner.  Since then, I've experimented with a lot of different burns and a huge amount of software applications that state they are 'easy to use' and 'efficient' and other adjectives that prove to be wrong.   urlLink Sony Vegas + DVD Architect 2  are by FAR the best authoring tools I have ever used for DVDs.  However, it is expensive at $800!  Vegas is a movie editing application with a lot of flexibility, but an easy layout that allows even an intermediate movie editor such as myself to easily author and render movies in a variety of formats.  DVD Architect allows you a whole world of freedom in composing and editing your DVD menus, chapters, remote options and lots of other stuff.  I've tried about two dozen DVD architecture software suites and packages, and this is the ONLY one I would recommend.  GREAT JOB SONY!  Ya'll finally got something right!  I choose AVI for my movies, as I find mpeg to be so compressed that when viewing on a television, you see vertical bars without picture running through across all the edges of your subjects.  However, those of you who have created movies know that AVI is less compressed, and therefore the files are huge.  For example, a 12-minute home video movie straight from my digital camcorder in compressed AVI format for NTSC-DV is 2.5gb.  Uncompressed it is 5.3gb.  (I've had to start buying supplimental hard drives for all this video work - I'm up to 490gb now.)  For those thinking of getting into burning your own DVDs, make sure you find out the specs on the media before you buy.  For example, TDK DVD-R 2x will actually read AND burn at 2x, where CompUSA DVD-R 2x will read at 2x, but only burn at 1x.  When it takes over 2 hours to prepare and burn a 12-minute video at 1x, cutting that in half makes a BIG difference if you have to burn 5 copies for your friends.  Onto the next burn!
