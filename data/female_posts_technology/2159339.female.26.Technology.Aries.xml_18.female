I want to know what's going on! I NEED to know what's going on. For instance, what is he wearing today? Is he wearing his glasses? Another device I would be equally happy with is a spycam attached to a tiny helicopter the size of a fly... Wait, he's here... He just walked by. He is wearing a yellow shirt and his glasses. Humph... I guess instead of electronic gadgetry I can just use my humanoid eyeballs. They will do for now... until I get my X-ray specs in the mail.
