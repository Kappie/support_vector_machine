Your last name stays put.   The garage is all yours.   Wedding plans take care of themselves.   Chocolate is just another snack.   You can be president.   You can never be pregnant.   You can wear a white T-shirt to a water park.   You can wear NO T-shirt to a water park.   Car mechanics tell you the truth.   You never have to drive to another gas station restroom because "this one is just too icky".   You don't have to stop and think of which way to turn a nut on a bolt.   Same work, more pay.   Wrinkles add character.   Wedding dress $5000. Tux rental -- $100.   New shoes don't cut, blister, or mangle your feet.   One mood -- all the time.   Phone conversations are over in 30 seconds flat.   You know stuff about tanks.   A five-day vacation requires only one suitcase.   You can open all your own jars.   You get extra credit for the slightest act of thoughtfulness.   If someone forgets to invite you, he or she can still be your friend.   You are unable to see wrinkles in your clothes.   Everything on your face stays its original color.   Three pairs of shoes are more than enough.   You can quietly watch a game with a buddy for hours without thinking: "He must be mad at me."   You can drop by to see a friend without having to bring a little gift.   You are not expected to know the names of more than five colors.   The same hairstyle lasts for years, maybe decades.   You only have to shave your face and neck.   Your belly usually hides your big hips.   One wallet and one pair of shoes, one color for all seasons.   You can wear shorts no matter how your legs look.   You can "do" your nails with a pocketknife.   You have freedom of choice concerning growing a mustache.   You can do Christmas shopping for 25 relatives the day before.   No wonder men are happy!   My favorite is "You get extra credit for the slightest act of thoughtfulness."
