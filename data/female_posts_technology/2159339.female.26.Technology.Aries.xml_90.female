I know I talk shit about my dad all the time - about his bad temper, unsolicited food fights at The Olive Garden, existential shananigans where he refuses to speak to anyone - but he just called me at work and offered to help me buy my new laptop. He even had me talk to one of his co-workers about what kind I want. Woo hoo! I know it sounds bratty, but I've been working my ass off ever since the paper route days, so when this type of stuff happens, I say thank you and accept graciously.
