Fri have a wedding Jen and I are taking a limo so we don't have to worry about drinking and driving. Sat hangin w/ Marcella. Her and I are gonna get into trouble I can already feel it.  As she said, "we will play good cop bad cop and break some hearts." LOL Sun have softball and a picnic. 9 more days till FL WOO HOO I think at this point Jen, Jim and I are more excited than the kids.  I will make sure and post some pics after we get back. Collen has a dr's apt today after work and then I am off to the gym.  Once I commit myself I never stop cause I don't want to get lazy again.  I still can't believe how lazy I got after surgery.  I think it had to do w/ depression too though.  Enough about that. Anyone think they can handle working out w/ me? BRING IT!
