She knew that the people didn't say it to be mean but in truth saying it to feel sorry for her.  Every night as the sun dropped from the sky, she would walk the pier, staring out across the lake, looking for her lover.  One day he went out on the lake only to never return at dusk.  He always said he would be back and yet he never returned.  She would never believe he would die and leave her.  She loved him with all her heart and soul.  Tonight was different though.  The search and rescue found the boat smashed up on a beach with no sign of a body.  Her heart finally accepted what her mind already knew, he was gone forever.  She walked to the end of the pier and stopped.  She glanced over her shoulder at the lengthening shadows before taking one more step off the pier.  At night the water is freezing and very deep with the waves crashing against the pier.    All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003
