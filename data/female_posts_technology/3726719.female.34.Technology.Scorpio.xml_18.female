It will probably take me a few days to get back into the swing of things.  The vacation was good.  Saw a couple movies, got some sun, had some sex, ate good food, and did some lounging around.   Of course I did a bunch of running around errands wise too.   And my roommates addiction to the Yahoo personals got me motivated to post another ad.  So I'm back online looking for love.  Sigh.  Feels a little pathetic.  My brain is a bit fuzzy this morning.  I have nothing of interest to expound upon.  So, I'm going to leave it here and will be back to reflect as necessary.  Happy Monday!  :o)
