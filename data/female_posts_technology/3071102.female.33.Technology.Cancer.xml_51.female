Judging though, by the majority of comments I get and see on other people's blogs... they wouldn't vote anyway, because they don't like any of the choices that are offered. It's sad to think that we are a free nation, and do have the ability to vote and have some say in the way that our government is run, but people are too jaded to actually do it.  They think that the polls are rigged, all politicians are crooks, and that it won't make a difference anyway.
