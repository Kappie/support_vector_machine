Tad: “I have 40 brain cells and the rest of you have, collectively, 9 and so I had a thought. Paul is a bad man and doesn’t know his thumb from an orange Popsicle, how could he be sure the baby than went missing is really Lesbiancas’ baby?” Krystal: “You shut up! I hate you. It was all fun and games when it was somebody else’s grandbaby but you are the devil to ever suggest it was mine! Never speak to me again.” Repeat variations on these lines every time they cut back to them.  Adam is having a meltdown over his missing grandchild. Lots of arm waving, spitting and hair shaking. Wow, but does he have a nice head of hair for an old coot. It’s like Michael Landon hair. I wonder what shade of toner he uses? I want that shade.  Mouth breather and Adam have a slap fight before Adam can call the cops.  Anita and bodacious ta-tas have a sisterly bonding crap fest over the fact that Anita let Lesbianca stagger off with a baby. I mean, I think that’s what they were discussing. I was having trouble concentrating because Anita had on, like, ¾ of a tube of lip-gloss. And her lips were all big and shiny and I was hoping Greenlee would come along and there would be making out. Anyway, Adam’s still pitching one in the hall and after several more hair shakes at Anita, she up and quits. She felt so bad, blah blah blah.   Babe (back up to full trailer trash make-up) doesn’t care that Lesbianca has her baby, it’s helping her cope or something. And she’s got JR on a very short leash so for the time being  he’s ok with no cops. In fact, he and Adam have it out (man, that head of geriatric hair is getting a major workout today) but as soon as JR wanders off Adam snatches up a phone and calls the cops.  Adam: “Wacky pervert killing, anorexic with a drunken mother lesbian stole my next evil cloning project! Er, granddaughter. I meant to say granddaughter. Just forget you heard the cloning thing officer.” Dear god in heaven Lesbianca if off her nut. She’s holed up at Erica’s ordering big piles of crap for the baby. And when did she have time to brush her hair and put on clean clothes? The continuity (or lack thereof) on this show makes me sad. At Jack’s Greenlee and Reggie are yelling about and whining about, respectively, his new “friend” when Kendall shows up looking for Lesbianca. Yay! Now there will be making out? Sadly no, but Kendall did paw at Greenlee a bit when she tried  to call Jack. (Jack is MIA by the way. I thought he was off looking for Erica but it turns out he is with someone named Lily. I’m guessing Lily is yet another offspring. Possibly one in rehab.) Hey doesn’t Reggie’s hair look cute? (Now if he would only shave the molester stash.)  Off Kendall goes to the boat house. Cause, you know, that’s where Greenlee would go it she was a baby snatching loonytoons and that is where she does go to talk to her dead, saintly boyfriend.   No Lesbianca at the boathouse, only the mouth breather. God he is the lamest tool in the shed.  Kendall: “I want to find Lesbianca so I can take her away to raise our baby. That’s right I am that baby daddy damnit!” Mouth breather: “don’t go. I need a line of at least 6 lip-glossed gals to watch me knit my brow and breath with my mouth open. And occasionally to watch me do push ups.  Lets get Lesbianca back so she can be the 6th! You’ll always be number one Kendall. ‘Cept when Greenlee is number one. Then you will be number two.” Kendall: “oh Ryan, because the writers are making me say this I love you! But it is physically painful. Luckily I am an amazing actress and can do it without vomiting.”      No Lena sightings.  The end. I had a lot of tequila while I was watching this so I probably left some stuff out. Sorry, you know,  tequila.
