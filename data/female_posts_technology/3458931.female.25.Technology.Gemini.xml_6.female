There was a lot to reflect on and it was hard having to pretend that everything is alright around everyone at work. I wrote down some of my thoughts on paper, they ranged in feeling from anger to sadness to acceptance.   I find my mind drifting off to thoughts of M a lot and it makes my chest tight. I don't seem to have much ambition. I still feel hungry and I still feel sleepy but I just don't have the desire to act on those impulses. I haven't cried today but I've come close, I'm really not much of a crier anyway.
