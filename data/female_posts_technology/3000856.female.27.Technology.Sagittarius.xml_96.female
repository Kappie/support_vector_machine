Waiting to hear from Sean about Collen so I can make my plans for Boston. I should just move there and start over. Make things somewhat easier for me. Although it would be a bitch to do everything to move out there. Going to court for Collen, school changes, find a job, find an apt, move my shit from Chicago to Boston. Man oh man, don't want to think about it. The hardest part is my family would not be around and who would I have watch Collen for me? I would never have a social life again! Oh well don't need to worry about it so its no big deal. Laterz gaterz
