If you analyse the break-up of activities associated with these 60 years of your life, you can see that it more or less matches with the following:   12 Years in Working   22 Years in Sleeping     04 Years in Routine Travelling   05 Years in Eating    03 Years in Bathing, Dressing etc...    06 Years in Useless Chatting, Gossip   04 Years in Sickness  Illness     Balance ? Only 4 Years        Our only question to one and all is, why should mankind think, involve in activities that result in sufferings, terror, hatred, fighting, killings etc... in the short span of 4 years left to them. It needs to be utilized in a better way by doing all good things, helping others and thanking God for the opportunity given to us in being a human being...    Live and Let Live.
