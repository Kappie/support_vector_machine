Or I feel cynical, the way old women do. Then, today, I had a pang that I wanted to have a child. I want to have a child because I'm bored. My theory is that people who choose to have kids have them because they're bored with their lives or with their mates. I'm not going to do it, but it would be nice to take care of someone and watch them grow. I'm only thinking this way because I need to justify why I'm wasting my life in the corporate world. I need a reason why I work the 8-5, because it's killing me. An unselfish reason. "I hate my job, but I gotta take care o' my kids" kind of reason. And the puppy theory isn't going to work, bec do you know how hard it is to own a dog in the city?
