So I did alittle self diagnosis and realized I must be trying to get sick. So I look in my medicine closet and saw it bear. Then I looked in my kitchen and found the rest of my Everclear. I figure hey it should be able to kill any germs. I took 4 shots and now my throat is even worse. Any ideas?    urlLink http://www.therockstar.org/index2.html
