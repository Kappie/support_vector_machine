No promises to keep it going though. ;)  Filling out the "about me" bits of the blogger setup was kinda silly. I hate those things anyway, so why am I volunteering myself? I must be tired..      Check out my website  urlLink www.fionacannon.net  - it's only in the making, so nothing is really functional yet.      Maybe I can use this as a way of listing my life's ambitions.... then again.... maybe not. Let's not get too carried away. ;) How about I just finish customising my bloggin' site and go from there? I'll add a photo later when I get a good one. (ha)    Let's see what this thing can do....
