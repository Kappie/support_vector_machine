(thanks, harold... thanks for nothin'!) he said he wasn't really a big fan of bob dylan. he assumes the people of that generation like him because it reminds them of "a simpler time" ... okay. sure... i could buy that... but ... what about the people who didn't grow up with him and still love him?      i just don't get it.
