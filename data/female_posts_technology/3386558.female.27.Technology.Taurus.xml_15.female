A boy who could talk And listen for hours on end. My best friend,  Who decided to date Two or three of my gal pals As I pined away for his affections. And when he finally decided to tell me Those THREE LITTLE WORDS- He moved to another town, another school, Another life. And I was left here to go on. Yet here I am, 12 years fast-forward, and his voice permeates through my office. I shudder when I hear it- Not because it sounds like a ghost, But because… Well, because it’s as irritating as a falling bra strap. The only way he grew up Was vertically. Some boys are always boys, at any age.  At 16,  Yet another “BF” who liked ME Just the way I was, But liked someone else A little more. Harsh reality for that girl Who had so much heart To give out. But she didn’t give up. She just moved on.  To 18, 20 And finally a boyfriend, a husband in training. Who could have known that He was on the other side of the galaxy While sitting right next to me. He could talk, Just like the rest, But he wouldn’t listen. He only heard the first part Of the sentence And played Mad-Libs with the rest, Filling in the blanks with nonsense. When I said good-bye, The walls that held us in Came crashing down. He heard that.  At 22,  and free of those men/boys- Or so I thought. Enter the tall, dark, and handsome. The shy and quiet. The man not afraid to cry… ALL THE TIME. With artist’s hands And a poet’s heart, He won mine  With a paper flower. And they say the eyes Are the doorways Into the soul; Little did I know That those cinnamon orbs Led into a prison cell. I don’t look good in stripes.  So I traded him in For a new model, A little lighter  In color and demeanor. Strong and rugged, With plenty of room for me To stretch my legs And spread my wings. He has some miles on him, But so do i. We both just keep on truckin’ Side by side Following the same road. Who knows where we’ll end up; The fun lies in getting there. And I intend to enjoy the ride Until the very end.
