My flight to San Jose (Delta Airlines) is overbooked. 15 people have no seats available. Three of them upgrade to first class for $150. Ten of them are offered to take the flight leaving tomorrow morning - Delta will cover their hotel.  2 are offered nothing. The fare they paid for the flight was too low - making them second class (actually class T) passengers. They don't get to fly today. They don't get a hotel. They can't upgrade for $150. Only option is to stay (on their dollars) overnight - fly tomorrow. Or buy the only first class ticket left on the flight - at full price - $1400.  Guess what group I am in? You're right. I'm one of the two.  After several calls to my boss he instructs me to buy the last 1st class seat - I am needed at the office tomorrow.  The other gentlemen in the same predicament also wants to buy the ticket. We fight over it.  I run back and forth between the gate and the ticket counter (you guessed it - two different sides of the terminal. Who said I am not exercising enough?).  He offers $2000 for the ticket (what is this? Ebay?). The battle rages.   The process above took place in the span of 2 hours. Two hours of arguing, running back and forth through the terminal, dealing with some seriously stupid agents with no IQ and even less compassion. It's hot, I'm cranky and I look like shit (Wrinkled suit, no make up, frizzy hair.. Ugh).   As I am dashing to the freakin' gate for the umpteenth time - a gentleman stops me apologetically. Tall, handsome, well dressed. I think he is going to tell me I dropped something. I've been dropping my stuff all over the terminal. Then the weirdest thing happens. He asks me "Are you married?". I am so stumped I don't really understand where the question comes from - never guessing this guy is hitting on me. "Yes, I am" I answer curtly. Disappointed look on his face, he says "Ugh. I was going to get some coffee and... oh well. I hope the rest of your day is better" (he's heard my not-so-quiet discussion with the agents). "Oh - and you're beautiful".  "Thank you" I say, stunned.   I gotta run to get the ticket, I do, and I get it. I run again to get on the plane. I make it.  And now I sit back and recall tis strange interaction. It's been a long time since anyone has hit on me. A bad day can turn not-so-bad with a single compliment.
