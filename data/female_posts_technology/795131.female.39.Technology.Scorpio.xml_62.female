Including two close coworkers of mine, and one of our programmers who is practically one of the founders of the company, who has been a loyal employee for 30 years, and was very close to retirement! I'm starting to want out now. I should start looking.  We got a Game Cube and the game Animal Crossing for ourselves as a family Christmas present. I just love watching my kids play it. Its such cute little virtual reality neighborhood, and I love watching my 2 kids each manouver their little characters around in it, and think of funny creative things to do.  My husband and both kids just got over strep throat! I'm lucky I didn't get it.
