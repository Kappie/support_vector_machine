I am not a fan of the vile stuff.  It seems like it will peel off pretty easily, so I won't have to go to Home Depot and buy some fancy, fandangled gadget to remove the stupid stuff.  It's really interesting to peel it off and see what's underneath.  Take our master bedroom, for instance.  Hmm...totally going off on a tangent here, but has anyone ever figured out WHY it's called the master bedroom?  Is it because the masters of the house sleep in it?  Anyhow, there's this hideous taupey-floral paper, with a navy floral border around it.  Yuck! :P  It peels off easy, and underneath it, it looks like a raspberry peach sorbet.  Yup, pink and peach walls, with some BROWN floral wall paper bits underneath.  WHAT where they thinking???  Also, we pulled up some of the living room carpet.  What beautiful hardwood underneath!  I don't think it will take a whole lot of effort to shine it up.  For those of you still interested in my achin' back syndrome, I have finally bit the bullet.  I am going to see my doctor tomorrow.  It's funny...going to the doctor shouldn't scare me, but I can already feel my nervous stomach a-rumblin'.  I mean, it's just for my back, right?  How bad can it be?  I'll keep you posted.   Anyhow, it's late and my eyes are starting to cross.  They've been blurry for some time now.  I think I've been playing too many computer games.  Yes, I do enjoy my computer games.  I'm particularly a big fan of Zuma.  Has anyone else played that one?  -J.
