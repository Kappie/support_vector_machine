Now that I made the previous post, I show up anywhere from third to first in the search results.  The searches are now more focused on finding the audio of the game.  If I can find it, I might as well post it here.   10:44 Update - If the audio file can't be found on the Peer to Peer networks, it doesn't exist.  Therefore, it doesn't exist.  Not that I  actually use  P2P software.  Someone told me.
