Most situations that involves them makes you think-I don’t need this shit! And you wonder if their sole purpose in life is to annoy or piss you off. You think that you were better off without them.  But are we really better off without them? I don’t think that’s always the case. These people-no matter if they seem like bitches and assholes are actually there to help shape the people that we ought to be. It’s always a choice on whether we decide to turn bitter, bitchy, mean or whatever repulsive being you could ever think of. But ultimately, if you look at it in a different perspective, they’re there to make us better people. It’s like they’re there to intimidate and challenge us to become the greatest individuals we can ever be.     (I’m not yet done. I have to go for now. I’ll continue this later on.)
