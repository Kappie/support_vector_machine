Gee, Shannon, you thought you would go literally non stop for 2 weeks and NOT get sick? Duh.  I got a call though from a girl in a recovery house.  I spoke there a few months ago and she has a pass this Saturday and has to spend the day with another woman in recovery.  And she called me.  She's a sweetheart and has my name! So we are gonna hang out Saturday afternoon.  We can hit a meeting and then what?  Coffee I guess and then... I dunno.  It will be interesting.
