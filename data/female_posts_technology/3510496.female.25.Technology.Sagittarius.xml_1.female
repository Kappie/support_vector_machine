'  urlLink     Hubby 'complained' that he barely sees me smile *my Chesire Cat grin*  urlLink    for the past days. So what's more in expecting a hearty laugh from me? Well, well, well I know, that most of my bubbliness had been sapped up with mama's hospitalisation.   From Thursday evening to Sunday night, I'd been in and out AH, like 2nd home, juggling between 1st home and 3rd home (parents' place) tending to papa and little sister's needs. Thank God little brother could be dependable on laundry and very-light cooking. But poor him to put on hold quite a number of job interviews.  But, on Monday morning, I woke up with a heavy block on my head, abdomen pull, hanging throat, and occasional vomitting. Doctor, oh doctor, my Temperature is like I'm on Fire! I put myself on sleep right after medication.   urlLink     At late afternoon, I was awaken with a news that finally put me into a *weak* smile. Mama had been discharged. I believe, she has to watch herself again, and be due for a revisit to AH, for progress check-up.  And later that night, Liza came back full blast of her old self, which is greatly missed by her dearest husband. Thank to 'FRIENDS'. Did you folks catch last night's episode. I didn't know that Ross has arachnophobia  urlLink   , and Rachel has fear merely swinging on swings *or swinging-motion-phobia?*.  urlLink     Today, back in another 2nd home (office), has a happy and a not-so-happy tone. Lets spoof on unhappy things first. It's CMW's month-end today, and LSS's month-end tomorrow. Ask me why CMW's month-end date is out of the ordinary, because tomorrow they are scheduling their mid-year stock take *so cruel to coincide with LSS's month end*. This is the problem when you have to support 2 companies.  urlLink     On a happier note, I have a new addition in bloglinks *so much for trying to cut down blogging*. She's the actual person I was hunting for that lead to the Mistaken Identity incident, sometime back. Surprise, surprise, I wonder how she located me. Must be from the joy of bloghopping. Hahahhh.
