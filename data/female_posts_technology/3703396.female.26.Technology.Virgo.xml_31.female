Taken with my Canon EOS Digital Rebel, Bulb setting, ISO100, F16 at 18mm.  We're going again tonight to the Town of Gilbert Old Town 4th of July celebration.  Will post those tomorrow!     This is a triple exposure over three bursts.  I don't think it's all that bad, for my first time ever trying to take fireworks shots!
