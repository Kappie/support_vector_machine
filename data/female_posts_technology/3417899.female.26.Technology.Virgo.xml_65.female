We could have been there today, or at least closer today - and despite my lack of a formal education, despite my minimal managerial experience, despite my inability to see (perhaps) the whole picture - I can pinpoint the crossroads where the wrong path was taken.  I can pinpoint the people responsible for downfalls. And I can see history repeating itself with the same people driving our future.  It will get worse before it gets better.
