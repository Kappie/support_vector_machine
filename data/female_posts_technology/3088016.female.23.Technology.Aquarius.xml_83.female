For one thing, they have enabled commenting, and I have consequently switched to using theirs.  Also, for less observant readers, they have offered several new templates and I have decided to change the look of my blog to use one of them.  I like this one better - comment and let me know what you think.  It's funny that nearly every blog I have visited lately from the 'recently published blogs' section has updated its look.    I liked this one when I first saw it yesterday, but knew that it would be a headache to implement.  I had been one of those people who isn't satisfied with the plain offering and have gone in and updated my blog by rearranging the code and adding features like my beloved GuestMap (which, by the way, now includes pins in Australia and China).  It did take me some time today to get things arranged the way I want them, but I'm finally satisfied.  If all else fails, I had saved the old template and can return to it at any time.  Another update is to the links section.  I have added the code to redirect to the Next Blog, so every time you click  urlLink Some Random Blog  it should show you a different one.  Pretty neat.  Beware that they're not all even in English.    Along this theme, the Spring 2004 semester is officially over.  I turned in my final take-home essay exam today.  As previously mentioned, I don't intend to return to UHD in the fall.  I'm sure that  urlLink UH Central  is quietly preparing for my arrival as we speak.  There will probably be summer school in some various elective subject or another, but I don't see any problems with being admitted, given my perfect GPA and significant work experience.  I won't miss UHD, but I will miss this semester's class.
