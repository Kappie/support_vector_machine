She'll sing a beautiful line then tap once on a cymbal; sing a line, then lightly strike her tom. She'll pluck two notes on her bass for every verse. It was quite lovely, actually. She sang like a lark over her cohorts' noisy fuzzy guitars, and the songs were short. (Never a bad thing.)  The Liars: Agnus Andrew is one nasty MF. He was absolutely repulsive in a gross non-charming way. Dirty stringy hair, dirty clothes, dirty everything. He was a hobo-clown in his strange dirty attire too. He wore a lavender sweatshirt with stupid retarded silkscreening ugliness. Over this he wore a booger-green blazer worn inside out with a Halloween costume tiger tail pinned to the back. He donned a red plaid hunter's cap and a single black glove trimmed with fur. On his feet were Reebok pumps, but they were imitation pumps. They had the basketball on the tongue but they were a generic brand called Air-Rite.   I saw The Liars open for the YYYs and John Spencer Blues 2 years ago, and I was riveted. They opened up a whole new world of punk-funk sonic stylings and I got into the genre of Gang-of-Four influenced bands like The Rapture and Moving Units. Last night was a disappointment because The Liars aren't fun anymore. I liked maybe 2 or 3 numbers. The rest was tedious. I've listened to their new album a couple times, and it's pretty inaccessible. The last time I listened, I was falling asleep and I woke up with a start and yelled, "Aah! XX, turn it off! Please, turn it off!"  Celebrity sighting: John Dwyer from The Coachwhips.    Doppelganger Alert :     =   ?
