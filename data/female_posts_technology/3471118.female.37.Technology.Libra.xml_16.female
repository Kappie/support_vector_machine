If you live in God (as a Christian), he will give you protection. You can trust in God to give you strength and to keep your safe from harm.  You don't have to be afraid of worldly threats, like attacks from enemies, diseases, etc.  God is going to keep you safe and what happens in this life isn't going to matter to the eternal life God will give you.  This is another way to look at my fears.  It seems like over and over again there are things in the Bible that talk about how you don't have to be afraid because God will protect you.  I'm doing better with my fears, but it would really help to be able to remember this more often than I do.
