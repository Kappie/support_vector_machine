This man I know (Man  A) wrote an email to his friend (Man  B) telling him about me (what I do, where I live, what I look like, etc). I still don't know how that email thread came about (or why the hell would Man B even be interested to know these details about me). Well, Man B sent an email to a close girl friend of mine, asking her if she knew me and could tell him a little bit more about me. In doing this, he actually forwarded the original email (from Man A) to her. From there, the path into my inbox was short.  The majority of the email was, surprisingly enough, pretty accurate - even the negative comments. One sentence there, threw me off: "Looks: For me, I would consider her 8.5. You would probably say she is a 6.5 or 7".   They are  grading  us now?  A Six or Seven?  Why would I get one grade from one man, then another form another man?   And why do I even care?
