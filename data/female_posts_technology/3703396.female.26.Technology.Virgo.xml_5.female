Opening up this particular bill is always an awakening event, with totals running from $70 in the dead of winter, all the way up to $300 in the blistering heat of August here in central Arizona.  Today, without much surprise, I found that we currently owe $199 for the month of June.  As this is a fairly typical amount, I shrugged it off as normal and decided that it was about time to take a look around at how much it would cost to get a more efficient air conditioner and air handler unit.  Moreso than the cost of energy, I am more interested in lowering the multi-decible wwWWWWHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA that protrudes from our current piece of junk unit that our builder so lovingly installed three years ago.  (Believe me, if I could make the A's a larger font, I would.)  I am also interested in lowering the amount of energy that is used here in Arizona, as it is always a topic for discussion in such a remote location of the desert.  I found out that our Goodman air conditioner,  urlLink model CLJ48-1 , is a 12 Seer 4-ton rating.  Uninstalled, this crappy model apparently runs about $1200.  That's about $1100 too much, in my opinion.  Constructed with 100% uninsulated vibrating steel, it can knock your swimsuit off in 1 second flat upon commencing its sequence of lovely conditioned air output.  We may as well be launching helicopters off our roof, in fact, this unit might just make them sound nice in comparison.  Taking this information a bit further, I began to investigate new systems.  An average Trane model XL16i would cost approximately $6,500 installed.  Did I do something wrong here in calculating?  Hmm, I guess not.  This does include the air handler, air conditioner, all cables and feeds plus labor and additional parts...  It would definitely be a more efficient system with a SEER of 17 and some hefty insulation... But at an approximate 30% cost savings over the life of the unit... that would save us approximately $500 per year.    So, I suppose if we are going to be in this house for 13 years, maybe it's worth it to investigate?  It would certainly be nice to lounge on the patio and smell my beautiful roses without the use of earplugs and a cane for stabilizing oneself against the ground vibrations.
