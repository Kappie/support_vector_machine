Then I changed all the addresses on the site where we had put them. Then I "put" all four pages up. Then we all worked on the cleaning. The Booth's arived safely at The Sims' house, and the Cliffords did too. We are going to just stay home tomorrow. Sunday we are going to fix the dog's kennel gate so it works again. After Trevor broke it a few months ago. I packed most my clothes for camp this afternoon.  I didn't want to be packing at the last min, and then forget something! Wow, camp is getting close! Only two days till we drive down!  Chantel will be there about the time we get there I think.....I can't wait to meet everybody! I finished the talk for camp a few min ago. I hope that goes smoothly!
