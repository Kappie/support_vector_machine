He has taken to bringing me flowers and picking up takeout on the way over and making my bed. And he looks really fucking good in the green shirt he wore yesterday. And I made a whole list of places I want to go to that no one other than him would be interested in going to. Art galleries and picnic spots and bike rides that my ex-boys would have laughed at, but set M frantically planning. We're trying to squeeze in as much as we can in these last few weeks. (Oh, and speaking of sqeezing, we also have matching zits! They're on the very top of the bridge of our noses, in the same exact place (slightly to the right). Wierd.)
