We ate nachos through Boyjazz and tried to guess what the singer's day job was. He was in his 30s, beer-paunchy, needed a haircut, and was wearing a tank top. I guessed "construction worker" while Ira and Abby bet on "Home Depot cashier" because as Ira reasoned, "He can't be in construction because look at his arms." (His arms were the opposite of muscular.) I asked Abby, "Where do you think they're from?" with my own answer already prepared (Sacramento) and she replied, "Stockton."   If I was alone, Boyjazz would've been painful. I would've again cursed myself for putting myself through another round of opening band torture. Luckily, friends and nachos can combat these ill effects.  The Husbands were great. They always put on a good show. A good combination is to smile and growl-sing through your songs. This works. What also works is a missing tooth. It's inconsequential if it's actually missing or just blacked out. In the modern-day frenzy of teeth whitening and invisalign, there's something horrifically charming about a missing tooth.   Auf der Maur were pretty good. I'd seen Melissa play in Hole in 1994(?) and I'd always been intrigued by her. She was the beautiful serene bassist who'd provide gentle back-up coos while Courtney Love drew everyone's fascination with her mess and sneering and attention-starved antics. With Melissa fronting Auf der Maur, I anticipated the second coming of Hole, but with more focus and a cleaner tighter sound. The primary guitarist used to be in this hard rock SF band, Stone Fox, which was around when I was in high school. She still rocks. Rounding out the band was a 2nd guitarist and a drummer, both dudes who rocked. The talent was there and the band was amazing, but I just didn't really like their music. They can really play and they're great live, but none of the songs were arresting. The one song I really liked was, ironically, the least rockin. She sang a slow pretty song for the encore accompanied only by her bass. Melissa is still the most babelicious lady in rock and roll, though. Too bad her music doesn't match the intensity of her performance.  Noteworthy: The drumkit was protected by a plastic shield which I dubbed "the sneezeguard." It was probably there for acoustic reasons, but I will safely assume that it also protected the drummer against germs.
