This year of the 32 will bring many new and exciting things for Dave...finishing off school (he's taking Biotechnology at  urlLink SIAST ), fixing up our new house, working his last days at Western Grocers, possibly having a pregnant wife...we'll have to see what the year brings in that respect. =)  Anyhow, I wish all of the best to my wonderful husband on his birthday.  He's the best man in the world, and I love him very much.  And, if you share is birthday, a happy one to you, as well.  -J.
