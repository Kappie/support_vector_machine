I sure hope we can figure out a way to get over there. A live taping has always been something I am interested in attending. I hope somebody cool is on that day.   What else is happening... ? The new Envoy is working out nicely. I think we'll be taking it up to Las Vegas next weekend. Can't wait for that vacation! Finally, we get to see Cirque's O performance. We've only been wanting to see it for about.. three years?   Somebody left our mail on the ground outside our door today. It's amazing anything makes it to our house. Most of the time we get other people's mail. Once in a while, somebody knocks on our door to say, "Here, this came for you. It was in my box." That's nice of them. I always return mail that comes to me incorrectly. But I have to wonder, how many pieces of mail never actually make it to my house?   That leads me to junk mail. Irregardless of electronic or physical, junk mail really irks me. Not necessarily because I have to throw it out, or because people are harrassing me, but it makes it really hard to sort through the junk to the stuff I actually need to read. Or in some cases, want to read. Example: MBNA sends statements in the same envelopes as courtesy checks, which are also deceivingly close to advertisements for credit protection and other crap I don't want. But I have to cut open my fingers trying to get through the hundreds of envelopes to figure out which are junk, and which are truly bills.   Another example is junk email. Once in a while, there are actually people whom I WANT to send me advertisements. Such as Caesar's Entertainment Group in Las Vegas, for ads about room rates and slot tournaments in Vegas. I want those. And stuff about Blue Man Group and their latest tours and albums. I want to get those. But I don't need viagra, and I don't need penile enlargements; I don't want a new driveway or a pool, and I don't need car insurance from Geico. Crap like that makes it very hard to sift through junkmail in both forms to figure out what is truly needed.   When I post queries about genealogical research, people take that email address and send junk to it. So I end up having to throw out most of the stuff that comes into those mailboxes as junk because it is so widely used. However, if I don't post an email address, people can't contact me regarding important genealogical connections. What on earth do you do to get around that?   Junkmail makes it too hard to get the information that you WANT to get. I couldn't imagine being the parent of a child of computer-age. I'd want he or she to have his own email address to talk to classmates and to family members, but how on earth do you control it? Sounds nearly impossible.   Well, it's off to the gym for another training session. I'm hoping to buy a new printer soon. Do you have any recommendations?
