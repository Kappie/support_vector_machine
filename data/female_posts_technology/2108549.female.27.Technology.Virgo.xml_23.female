We just clicked and that is always a good feeling.  The job sounds like a wonderful opportunity, more money that I would have asked for and "normal people" hours. I have an interview with the managers tomorrow afternoon and should know sometime tomorrow if I got the job or not.  The only scary thing is that it would start Monday and well frankly, I'm scared. Its been a long time since I have worked and even longer still since I have worked in a call center technical environment. I know I have the skills.... they are just a bit rusty. There is no way to polish them up though without jumping right in.  Its an awesome opportunity and if I am offered it, I'm definitely taking it.  I also spoke to the car insurance company and my finance company, the difference between what I owe on the Honda and what they are paying me for it is a total of about $140.  So that major financial burden is gone.  Once the contributors to Freedom's Fund are paid back, I'll owe very little and I can go back to school.  Hopefully in January.  The idea scares me silly though.    There has been so much good this week that I am looking forward with one eye closed waiting for something really bad to happen.  But ya know what.... I don't think its gonna.  God has taken care of me beyond my expectations and I have people in my life that help when needed.  Its amazing.  I'm starting to feel lucky to be me instead of lucky to just have "stuff".
