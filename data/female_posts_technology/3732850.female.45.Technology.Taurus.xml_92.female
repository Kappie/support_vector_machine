Even now with my children grown and on their own, I'm still a wife and student. It would be nice as she said, "I want a wife who will listen to me when I feel the need to explain a rather difficult point I have come across in my course of studies." Among other parts of her idea, this will all too soon be a reality as I hit school full time next semester.
