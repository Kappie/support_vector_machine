Of course, the day long diet of bananas may have kept Harshala on a potassium high; who knows? ;)   I had the vitamin, shake breaky (Gemma would be proud of me using that word!), tuna salad lunch, and had a 6" whole wheat crab salad sub with tomatoes and chocolate milk for dinner; apparently it has 6 grams of fat or less, so that was a good choice. Is anyone else finding that they're less hungry? I think my stomach is getting smaller. I went to the batting cage with Ms. Switall as well, but kind of blew things when I had a Smirnoff Ice while watching Rick ump. I had some raspberries and cream cheese as a snack when I got home and did some weights and stretching before bed.   Tonight is going to be tough... we have a baseball game at 6:30 on the other side of town, which doesn't leave much time for something to eat before hand. And then, the team will want to go out for wings and drinks... willpower, don't fail me now! But playing ball is fun and since its the end of the month, I'm really too broke to party much anyways. :)   Heather; you're exactly right. It would suck if we put ourselves through drinking shakes and eating entire banana trees, only to lose out on this b/c you couldn't get your tush off the couch. When I was eyeing the foot long meatball sub last night, I thought "I've been doing really well today; I'm not going to ruin everything I've done b/c of a damn sub". I think the longer we go with eating well and exercising, the less likely we are to be tempted by Doritos and sitting on the couch b/c we've invested so much effort thus far.   How is everyone feeling about the weekend? Are you planning on getting some serious exercise in, or do you think its going to be hard following your diet when you're so much closer to your fridge all day?
