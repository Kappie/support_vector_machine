I try to find comfort in the company of friends, books and television. Sleep is always good but sometimes the demons find their way into dreams. Distractions help pass the time. Some are worthwhile and some waste moments. No matter what I do, I cannot leave me. My body contains this soul-a soul restless and in pain. The soul cries while the body smiles. More often than not, the body is ashamed of what the soul feels and has mastered the art of facades. I try my best to be strong. Deal with shit, fall down and stand up again. Struggling with a mind that thinks too much. Continuously trying to make sense of things and always trying to look on the brighter side even when life is saying that it's the end of the world. My friend once told me that "life is how you see it"-I agree. What you project to the world is what life will reflect back to you. So I try to remain possitive. And I'm tired. I'm tired of the weight. I've always remained independent but now I have to admit that I need someone to help me.
