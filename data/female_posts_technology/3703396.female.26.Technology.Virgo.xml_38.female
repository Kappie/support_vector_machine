It’s almost like they are not legal tender in Nevada.  Not one casino would cash them, nobody would let me play them, heck; I couldn’t even PAY for my food with them at the Luxor!  It’s almost like they are not American coins.  It’s a conspiracy against the little coins of the world!    When we left Vegas I was about $100 up, and Andrew was down $60.  I had a great run on a craps table at the Rio on our way out of town and earned about $75 of my winnings, so it was nice to leave town a winner on my own roll of the dice!  In other news, on Monday I finished Course 1 of the Wilton Cake Decorating series.  My neighbor Trudy begged me to go with her and then she bailed after the first class.  I went by myself and had a great time!  I am going to try to sign up for Course 2 at a Michael’s that is closer to my house.  This one was at Desert Ridge which is about 35 miles north of here.  This coming Saturday is my last personal training session at the 24 hr Fitness gym.  I am glad that is over.  While I like the motivation to go to the gym, I don’t think it is necessary.  In fact I think it hinders my workouts because he works me very hard and I feel I shouldn’t make myself so sore afterwards.  Plus, meeting with the trainer means I have an appointment and specific days, so I can’t just go when I want to go.  And with him, I am so sore that I don’t feel like going on off-days.  Andrew and I are going together this Thursday to see if he would like to join.  I hope that he does, because it would be great to have him as a workout partner.  I think that would provide more motivation than anything for me personally.  Tonight we are going to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban at the IMAX Theater in Tempe.  Andrew and I are meeting his sister Amy and her friends Denise and Jeff there.  Should be fun I hope, seeing Harry and his friends on an 80 foot screen!
