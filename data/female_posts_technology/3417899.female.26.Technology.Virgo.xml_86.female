My parents have been the nail for the past decade. Taking one blow after the other.  I have been the hammer for a while now - the shoulder, the ears, the bank.   My sister has always been the nail, even when there was no real reason, and sometimes when there was.  I have been the hammer - when she cries, when she screams, when she breaks.   My little brother is a hammer in the making, but being young - I'll always think of him as the nail.    -- Alternative ending --   I wanted to end this blog with a sentence depicting the fact I am tried. Burned out (hence the title) of being the hammer for everybody. But as I was typing, I realized that is not entirely true.   My wedding brought a bigger hammer into my life. A 5 kg pound hammer to my flimsy 1 kg.  I can now rest, and let my husband be my hammer and theirs.      I forget the exact wording... But it's something like:    G-d only gives you what you can handle.
