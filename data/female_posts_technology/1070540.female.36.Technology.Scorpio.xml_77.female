I think its because I have worked so much this week that I havent had time to think about anything else, so when I get a chance to think, it all comes to me in a fast paste. Almost like I talk. (ok as fast as I talk)   One thing I have been thinking about is how come I work so hard for a company that does not give a shit. And the ones who dont work so hard is the ones they give all the special projects to that can allow them to move on to different areas.   uggh.... make it stop.   Another thing is....and another and another and another..... thats how my thoughts come to me.  back to back to back.   No wonder why my husband hates when I get to be a flibberty gibbet cause I never shut up, and what I have to say isnt really important its just my thoughts.He is wonderful and he tries to listen but I try not to talk though its hard but I have been doing a great job at it. But now it just rumbles in my head. I think I will start a new blog, one just to write down everything I want to say that no one will care about, and just get them out of my head. See I am rambling again.
