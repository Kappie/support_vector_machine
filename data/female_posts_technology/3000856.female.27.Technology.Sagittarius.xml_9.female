Sending resumes everywhere and still nothing.  Man what the hell is going on?  What is going on w/ my life right now? Why is it everything is in the negative and not the positive? Oh well enough about poor me. LOL Long weekend planned.  So much to do, so many appointments and lists of things to get done.  Yeah.  Someone told me they think I am going to give up my old friends for my new friends in the band.  WHAT? That makes me mad.  Anyone that knows me also knows that I never trade one for the other.  There is only one of me, but I will still divide my time.
