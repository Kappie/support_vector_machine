So sorry to disappoint but that's why the subject is what it is. So I wish I had some cool stuff to say but I don't. Oh wait I do have a funny story from lunch today. I was at McDonald's eating by myself like a loser cuz I took my lunch late and all of the people from work hadn't eaten in like 56 years so they left without me. I was sitting by the door and some guy in a suit walks up to me and is like "Hey what's up?" I'm like, "I'm eating. That's about it." So he was asking for my name and shit like that while I was thinking how much I wasn't enjoying my meal anymore and deciding that I was gonna take this to go and putting my food in my bag . I mean who hits on people at a McDonalds?!? Oh well anyway, I was being all short and he noticed and left be4 I got up from the table. He was walking forward with his head turned back saying bye to me and smiling like a dumbass and BAM! He went face first on the door. Apparently he didn't know it had to opened first or something. Maybe it was a "u had to be there" moment but I thought it was pretty fuckin funny. Then of course I called everyone in existence and told em bout it. Anyway, that was the highlight of my day. Other than that, got outta work, went for a swim, and went to the track like any other day. I also cleaned up a bit which I needed to do cuz it was smelling kinda funky in the living room after this weekend. Which reminds me, someone left their trunks in my dryer. They're red and black just in case someone who was here this weekend reads this and knows the owner. Well I got them. I think they're sending me to Houston this weekend at work but I'm not sure yet. I hope not. Traffic there sucks. Plus I don't really feel like getting shot either. We'll see. Ok well I'm off to bed.
