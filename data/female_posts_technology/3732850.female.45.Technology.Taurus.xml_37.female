It is on average at one dollar and eighty-eight cents. This is just ridiculous when the price of gasoline went up to over two dollars a gallon. How outrageous is that? I remember driving by wal-mart and telling my oldest daughter, "At these prices, Mom is going to have to quit school!" It was just getting to be too high of a price. I live forty-five miles away and round trip it takes a lot of gas, not to mention the wear of the tires. My three year old was on the riding lawnmower with me last week and I ran out of gas. We went to fill the gas can so I decided to fill my car too. It was over thirty dollars. I couldn't believe it. When I got home, I told him to play on his swingset in the playpen until I get the grass mowed around the trees. He is three years old and mischievious. I filled the pushmower up with gas and left the gas can sitting within his reach. I had the inside of the fence to mow and he spotted this bright red can and starting dumping the gasoline on the ground. He's lucky I didn't tan his behind. I stripped his clothes, washed them two times in the washer and gave him a bath. He had gotten gasoline all over his pants. He had spiderman pajamas on that he refused to take off and wanted to wear them for the day. After getting gasoline all over and on the ground he had no choice but to go in the tub and get different clothes to wear.
