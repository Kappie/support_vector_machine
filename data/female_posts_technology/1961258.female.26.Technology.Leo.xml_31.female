So it was all .. water retention or dehydration or whatever travelling does.     Yup ... I'm losing weight .. yippee! I guess the run up to the vacation plus those few days away was a nice jumpstart I needed! Heh! Clothes fit much better and the scale reflects it .. down to 165, which isn't much but come on. .. progress! :) Down to 160 by the end of August. I'm taking it real leisurely, which is a good way to go I think.     Lotsa exercise (cardio plus 10,000 steps a day) and watching what I eat .. but not actually dieting. It's been working out fine.     I don't feel too great these past few days .. fever-ish, constant headaches, feel very achy  lightheaded .. and what not. So taking it slow.
