There's a discrepancy in those scales - digital vs. non digital/basic. I'm not saying that I'm not that weight when it's 2.2 or 2.142, but was wondering why there's a difference.   First - 77.6 kg x 2.2 = 170.72 lbs Second - 77.6 kg x 2.142 = 166 lbs - exact numbers on the scale (both)  Are the British more exact in their measurements then?   I know that the digital scale is the most accurate measurement. But why is there a huge difference - 4 lbs. in the calculation?
