So I got to rip open the box, and unwrap packages and bags, manuals, etc.  Then I had to charge up the battery so I could actually play around with the settings and stuff.  After a  very  long hour the battery was charged, the memory installed and I was ready to rock and roll.  I took some random pictures of our living room and then tried some closeups of mine and a friend's face.  There are so many settings that I still have to read about, but what fun!  It's like Christmas :)  I also installed the software to download the pictures from my camera to my laptop.  One more thing to learn about and play with :)  Perfect timing too, now when I go home for a little visit I can take pictures with my new camera.  Can't wait :)
