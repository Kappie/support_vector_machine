I love it out here, the ski is very blue and no clouds in the ski, the only thing that is in the ski are the birds flying and the sun smiling at you. I enjoy the trees more than I did the mountains in Montana and Colorado. People say that I'm crazy for not missing the mountains, but I feel comfortable with the trees. I love the sound of the children swinging off the trees into the lake. Some are laughing while they are jumping in or just standing my the shore line.  I love the sound of the children while their tubing or water skiing. I feel so relaxted in the boat and I always forget that I'm deathly afraid of the water, I actually don't even think about the fear. Maybe, I don't need to have any fear because I know if I fall in my husband will be right behind me to save me. He introduced me to this wounderful place we any chance we can. I love fishing even if I don't catch anything, its more a relxation thing and also I can have some special time with my husband without the interruption of the world and my son loves it too. Maybe one day when my daughter is a little older she will enjoy it like the rest of us do.  My daughter doesn't like it but when she has to come with and the sun fish or pan fish are bitting, then she has fun. When she gets older she will appreciate the outdoors more. Right now she's into having friends over and playing with her bratts dolls and baby dolls. My husband hopes that when she grows older pretty much in her teens that she will like the outdoors like her brother. I hope she will think the same ways as I do about the lakes, trees, and watching the birds fly by or even stop to eat.
