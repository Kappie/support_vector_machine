I am doing a "trial run" on my day off to see how long it will take me to ride my bike to work, and how brave I feel doing so. :) Any words of encouragement for me? It will be good exercise, which I need since I sit in an office all day, and it will help seeing as my husband and only have one vehicle at the moment which he has to use for work. I have just got back into bike riding and am still feeling a little nervous about riding alongside traffic.
