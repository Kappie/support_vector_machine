They didn't have much there to try on though, so I'd have to trust a catalog photo. I took a look at the website for one of the lines they carry and found  urlLink this one  which looks rather similar to the Jordan gown mentioned in an earlier entry. The website for that company is  urlLink www.bridaloriginals.com  and apparently they're orders come in comparatively quickly. (With many companies, it is already to late! Seems crazy to me.)  I think my favorite of the dresses I have tried on it the Jordan dress, but it is a bit sheer. I'm thinking of dress shopping with my sis when I'm in Indiana next week and then just ordering the darn dress if I don't find anything.
