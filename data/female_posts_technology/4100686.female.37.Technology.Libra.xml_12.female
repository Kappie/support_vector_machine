Thanks  Ihath .    urlLink Rafedain  Is an Arabic blog like news feed. It reports news about and from Iraq. The tone is very journalistic. For example (Today AL-Hakeem made 5 demands from the UN, In a news conference held at x Al Hakeem reported that he is drafting ...) you get the picture. Non of the news items quotes a source nor is their an about me to tell us who the people behind it are. A fyi fact, rafedain means the two tributaries or two rivers. Iraq is frequently called "belad al rafedain" the country of the two rivers. A reference to the Tigris and Euphrates.
