I do it myself, and I think it's about the excitement of the unknown.  Testing your own limits and taking risks.  We learn at a young age that it feels kind of good to do what you're not supposed to do.  It's the adrenaline associated with it.  That's why the kids who had tons of restrictions do a lot of sneaking around and go crazy in college, while the kids who were given a lot of freedom don't seem interested in breaking the rules.  Like if I were to say, whatever you do, don't go to  urlLink www.zefrank.com , how many of you would go there just because I said not to?
