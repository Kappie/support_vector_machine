Breakfast right after workout - cereal (1 cup) w/raisins 5. Lunch (at 4pm though) - usual 6. Snacks - cookies (4 .. 40cals each), fruits - mango, fruit juice, chips (1 small bag), choc (Wispa 1/3bar) .... throughout the day. 7. Workout (pm, after 5pm) - Cindy Crawford's Shape Your Body, Workout 1 (did about 3/4 of it though, the legwork totally killed me!) 8. Dinner - average, less than usual .. at about 8pm  So .. hmm a good start I would have to say. I think I know where my exact problem is .. towards the end of the day, I get these cravings or I just eat because I'm bored (or eat while I watch TV). So I have to keep watching that. But truly, my snacking today was really on the low side .. I'm usually way way way overboard .. so i am super happy about today.   The only bad news is that I stepped on the scale and I'm actually 170lbs (in the morning). Gross!!!! Then when I stepped on it later in the day .. i was over 170. Dammit, how can I put on so much weight in less than a couple of days? I have like this huge Buddha belly nowadays .. it's not funny .. it's so distended, probably bloated with water or something.  I want to go on a juice/liquid fast .. but .. i never have the motivation to do that! Argh! I think I need to take some drastic action soon.
