The favor will soon be returned... in bed ! (Empress of China)  ***  I hope everyone had a great weekend. Hubby and I sure did. I was frustrated that it got colder, rained, and was cloudy all weekend and therefore couldn't enjoy my new capris to the fullest.  Yes, my newest wardrobe arsenal is this khaki capris I bought from Old Navy over the weekend. Old Navy really has amazing prices. This Vietnamese family ahead of us in the checkout line bought massive quantities of clothes that rang up to $280. When I went on a shopping rampage (right before hubby and I decided my credit card would do less damage if left at home at ALL times), i spent about the same amount on 5 pcs. of clothing. So get ye to an Old Navy near you!  One thing I will not do again is go bikini shopping with Hubby around. You'd think he would appreciate me trying on all these bikinis on for him but he kept rushing and looking shell-shocked at the prices. That's okay, I'll hold off on my purchases until I enjoy shopping a bit more. I plan to lose 5 lbs. in the next month and then shopping's on, baby!  We watched Hellboy and the Alamo. Hellboy is recommended but Alamo, unless you're really interested in the story of the Alamo, not so much recommended. I was bored half the time. I think the LOTR movies have spoiled any future epic movies for me.    Church was packed. Felt sorry for poor hubby but grateful that he accompanied me.  I really should learn a bit about his religion cause he's been so good with mine.  Ate out too much. We hit the buffet again over the weekend. Hubby is obsessed with them.  During the movies, they advertised this new buffet restaurant, and when we passed by it, he just had to go in and check out the food and prices even though it was already 9:30 at night.  Well he's buffet obsessed, I'm blog-obsessed. Thank goodness mine has less calories...
