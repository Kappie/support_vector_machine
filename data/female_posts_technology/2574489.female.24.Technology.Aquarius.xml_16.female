So anyone who could not view it before should have no problems now.   ***  To anybody who does not know about Netflix, it is a DVD service based online.  You choose as many DVDs as you want, they come to you three at a time, and you can keep them as long as you want without any late fees.  Best of all, when you're done, you return it in an envelope provided by Netflix and not have to pay any shipping charges.  All this for $20/month plust tax.  Blockbuster videos are $4.32 each, so if you rent 5 in a month, you would have saved over Blockbuster.    We signed up for said service and last night watched a kickass chick flick from Netflix that Woody and I loved.  The movie was a foreign one, based in Hong Kong, called  urlLink So Close  .  It stars Shu Qui from the Transporter, and two other kickass females.  I love movies like this. (Rhy, we'll rent it again...you HAVE to see these girls).
