So I stumbled around in the dark, found some water and drugs, swallowed and fell back into bed.  But on the flip side, I slept much better from 5:30 to 8:30...a little too much better.  I had a dream that DC and I went to my place again.  We were at church and there was this rock band playing on the balcony.  All my friends were there too, and some were in the band.  I remember them being good, but can't remember what they sounded like.  Strange dreams.
