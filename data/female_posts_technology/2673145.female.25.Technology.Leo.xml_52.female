It is a futurist story when robots are everywhere on the streets doing what some bangladesh indians, philippinos, indonesians, china chinese, thais are doing in S'pore. A new breed was developed to replace the older version. And then it happened. These new breeds started to rebel and started to take over the world, almost.  Fantastic graphics! The martial arts moves are so fluid and pretty natural on the robots. Very nice moves too. Interesting although somewhat predictable story, but has a great twist that keep you guessing. It's entertaining!  It's worth 4/5.
