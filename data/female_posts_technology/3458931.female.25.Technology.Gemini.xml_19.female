We took a spin around the tannery to see what was happening, and where, then decided to shuffle off to The Snooty Fox for a drink. I like the atmosphere of TSF, lots of wood panelling and pretty dark. Oh, and they make an incredible pork sandwich, which I didn't have this time in. Our bartender was very nice, he made my ceasar a bit too spicy but topped it up with some extra Clamato for me later.   Afterwards we walked through the rain back to the tannery. Now to digress for a minute. Maybe I'm showing my age, or maybe I'm just showing my IQ, but what kind of retard wears a mini skirt, strappy sandals, and a tank top out at night when it's cold and raining, and nothing else? It's not like I was wearing a rain slicker and gum rubber boots, but there's a line somewhere between stylish and sensible right?  Back on topic.   We ended up at Dolans where a band called Flat Top was playing, hope I got the name right - maybe it's al one word? The mood of the place was very upbeat. It seemed that everyone was having a good time, and it was nice to groove to the music and feed off the good vibes. I ran into someone from my home town, she was with one of the band members. She looked incredible; younger than me though she's one or two years my senior. She was practically glowing and seemed genuinely happy and friendly. It's nice to run into people like that from "back home". Much better than people who dig for information until they're satisfied that they're doing better than you.   A great night, and now it looks like it will be a great day.
