This is a very worthwhile fundraising bike ride (Houston to Austin, ~180 miles), and the money we raise goes to end the devastating effects of MS.    Just about every Saturday or Sunday morning, instead of sleeping in, we are headed out to the nearest semi-suburban area to ride 50-60 miles and pay thirty bucks for what essentially amounts to SAG support and a t-shirt.  I won't lie and say I don't miss sleeping in, but we have so much fun out there.  You wouldn't believe how romantic it is to play "Guess That Roadkill."    Wayne's mom has agreed to send us $25 each.  That brings my grand fundraising total to... $25.  Here comes my shameless plug.  If you're a kindhearted enough soul to want to join me on this ride through your sponsorship, please check out my  urlLink donor page .  It could be the best money you spend all year.    Also, here's a link to the  urlLink web page  I made for the team I'm riding with, the Saint Arnold Brewery.
