Not me of course... a friend...  5 years together with her now ex-bf, a relationship which all of us deems to be unbreakable, stable and heading towards marriage... and now, 5 years later, 1 single jerk comes along, stuck himself to the lady, and there she goes...  This is just 1 of the many such cases I have seen among my friends. Does time really measure the strength of a relationship? Saddly to say, the answer is "No". Is this really how fragile relationships are these days? Perhaps it is. I have just gone through a rough patch in my own... gladly to say, things are alright now...  Absence defintely do not make the heart grow fonder in most cases, at least not for the many cases I have seen in my life. Absence makes the heart grow wilder... that would have been a better description for relationships these days. Oh well... Wilder or fonder... only time can tell... No signs of any wedding bells ringing from any one around me yet... or maybe there is 1... my buddy.... hahahaha... Ding Dong Ding Dong... I hope my time will come! =D
