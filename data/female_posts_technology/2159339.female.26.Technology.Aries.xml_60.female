Not really trying, since I'm typing this and listening to music and ignoring work altogether, but that's what weekends are for..hrrr. Yesterday I realized I actually miss the punk, even though we fought all the way to the airport...and all week prior. Still, I have a month to redeem self in the gift-giving department, since this is the first time in 15 years that I had lovely  thoughtful presents to open on Christmas morning (all from him since my family are a bunch of commies) but gave him a book he already owns in exchange.    The evening prior (birthday of Jesus) was spent with his parents and sister and porkchop the cat, at which point I realized what a terrible sucker I am for families and baby pictures and non-boyfriend's old bedrooms that are now antique storage rooms. Not that I'm getting sentimental or changing my mind about anything. It was nice, that's all I'm sayin.   After sending him off on Friday, I spent the weekend in Carmel-by-the-Sea with Alex and Nick and Genny  her family. Will write more about that later.
