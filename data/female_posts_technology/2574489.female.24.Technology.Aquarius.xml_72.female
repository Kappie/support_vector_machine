They have great incentives right now, I swear.  They'll take $15,000 off the price of the home, pay your closing costs, and pay 3% of the down payment.  They'll also give you a $500 upgrade voucher if you meet some requirements.   Grabe  ang good deal!  I went with him to visit the model homes.  I love model homes so much.  Of course KB Homes is nothing like  urlLink Grand Homes  or  urlLink David Weekly , but still, I love the way they decorate in there.  Can someone decorate my place like that?  T will be choosing visiting the KB Homes Studio on Fri. and he wanted me to come.  Too bad I have to work.    So if anyone is thinking about selling a home, and you have a KB Home builder near you, get thee there fast.
