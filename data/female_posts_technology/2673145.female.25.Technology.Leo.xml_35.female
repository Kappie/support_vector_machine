This one had lotsa slapsticks and corny jokes which fails to deliver the punch. Nevertheless, there's still lotsa laughter. (I was wondering why the two gals next to me were laughing so hard when I was frowning at the corny jokes. It wasn't even that funny!) Crazy gals aside, it's still a funny romantic girlie show. I was with a guy so didn't really feel much of a romance out of the movie. Haha.   Adam sang in the movie again, and it sorta sound the same as in the wedding singer. You'd pity Lucy (the gal who lost her short term memory) for having to begin each day with so many emotions. But you'd also envy her for having such a sweet guy willing to do so many things for her. That's from a gal's point of view of cos. ;)  Next: Van Helsing, Troy, Blood Brothers (chinese)
