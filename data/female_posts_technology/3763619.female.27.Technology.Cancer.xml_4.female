Since it wasn't one of her more popular hits, many of you may not be familiar with it. Upon hearing that song today, I was instantly taken back to 8th grade and that one boy I had a crush on at that time. I can't recall his name right now, but I do remember sitting in my bedroom at night and rewinding the tape to that song over and over again and thinking of him. Thinking of that brought a smile tomy face and lightened my mood a little. It's nice how things like that can happen out of the blue, but music is like that. It can take us to anyplace we want to be, and that's the beauty of it.
