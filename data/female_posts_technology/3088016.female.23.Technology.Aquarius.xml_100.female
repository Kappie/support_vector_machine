It's excessive.  The  urlLink Stinch of Life  - I'm not kidding, that's her title!  Some teeny bopper song played when I hit the page and made me feel old as dirt, even though I'm not.    The  urlLink Bush Hater  - I strongly disagree with his politics, but this guy can write in complete sentences and I'm impressed.   The  urlLink Foreign Blog  - Is that Portuguese?  The  urlLink Grammar Nightmare  - wHAt iS it ABouT pEOplE WhO wRiTE lIKe thIs?  I blame it on bad schools in Singapore.    I seem to get discouraged every time I see who my blogging peers are.   urlLink The   urlLink people   urlLink I   urlLink know   urlLink who   urlLink have   urlLink blogs  don't write poorly at all.  Perhaps it's because when we were growing up (seriously) the main form of communication wasn't the dumbed-down cyberEnglish chatter that we see from these kids today.  It must be such a challenge to be a teacher having to explain why LOL is not a word they should use in a term paper.  I shudder to think of how business communication will look in ten years.
