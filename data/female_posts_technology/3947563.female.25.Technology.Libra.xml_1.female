Then for supper, I tried to be all healthy at the restaurant by ordering an eggwhite omlette, but when the waitress brought the thing out it had french fries with it! I mean, that's like ordering a vegetarian entree and getting steak on the side. I wasn't going to eat them....but I did, lol. Meh, there weren't a whole lot at least, and I suppose I can  almost  justify it, since that is the first time I've had fries in 3 weeks. I have decided I can eat crap (moderate crap) for one meal a week, so that just means I'll have to be good this weekend. I didn't work out yesterday either. I came home from the game and fell asleep as soon as my snot-filled head hit the pillow.      I am going to try and do some moderate exercise tonight. Probably walking, because I am still not feeling well. Perhaps I shocked my body last week and this cold is its way of saying, "Baby steps please, I'm used to a steady diet of white sugar and grease." I am planning on going tent shopping tonight, so that should give me a wee bit of exercise too. I keep wanting to go buy clothes, since my summer wardrobe is REALLY sad, but then I keep thinking, "Don't do that, you might have to buy a smaller size in a month!" Not likely, but it keeps money in my wallet, lol. See you all at the meeting.
