The book is  Neverwhere  and one of my favorite characters is  Door  because she can open all kinds of doors and locks.  She lives underground in London much like R. Perlman's Vincent in  Beauty and The Beast .  When the old woman said  "I'm sorry.  It starts with doors,"  you can just imagine a grandfather clock's long hand click.  The book says that there are things you can't see because you don't want to or because it seems out of place that you credit it to dream or illusion.  I've also read  Stardust  and I find it okay, but I love Neverwhere and his graphic novel  Dream Hunters .  How are you, Dad?  Were you able to watch the Oakwood incident last weekend?  It's political isn't it?
