Blame that on my poor time management.  To my surprise, I bumped into Hamka in class. I was so excited upon seeing him in class again that I behaved in an erratic behaviour...my god...I sure have created a damn good impression of myself. As we went out together in class today, he was telling his friend that I was his classmate eight years ago. And I go again, "Eight years? Surely not that long?" I have passed the jc stage that long and I did not realize it... As I recalled that remarks, I felt proud that I still maintained a close relationship with my jc friends...In fact, I am going to JH's house on sunday for BBQ...  In the part-time class today, did I realize that Kay, the ger who always sits in front (the one who I think resembles Sharon), is a financial controller! I am impressed by her dillegence and self-motivation to pick up a skill/degree that is out of her own job scope. It is in fact totally different from what she is doing. Well, I should be motivated to learn from her....
