Denise had a craft planned for us.  We made thank you gifts for the teachers and leaders in the church.  The girls got to make two, one for someone in the church and one to take home to give to someone.  A lot of the girls had a hard time with this.  Some wanted to take both home, others wanted to give them to each other...  It was kind of tough telling the girls that they couldn't, but I think it's an important lesson that they need to learn.  It's also hard to get them to think of people outside of their immediate family.  So an interesting night.    Afterwards we had a counsellor meeting at one woman's house.  That was a little strange.  All the other counsellors are married with kids.  I felt really young and free.  They were talking about how difficult it is to get out... how more than twice in one week is plenty...  And I'm thinking, only twice?  Its kinda nice being able to go out whenever you want.  I think I'll enjoy others peoples kids for awhile :)
