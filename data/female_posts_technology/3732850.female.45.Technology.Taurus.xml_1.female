We go aroundsmelling them and they smell so good that you want to buy them and you never burn them andall they do is collect dust. I'm a victim in this candle scam; I think that they make them smell so good for us to buy. I have tos of candles and I think I have only burned about six of them.  The bottom of my entertainment center is covered with them and I don't know why I actually buy them for. My husband even says that I have too many. I have to buy buy them! I don'tunderstand why I buy them and I have been to other people's houses and they have the same amount or more then I do and theydon't burn them, too. They turn out to be knickknacks if anythingelse. Maybe, we think that they are a smoothing thing and we need that in our live, something to help us settle down from a hard day at work, college, and even our teenage kids. I think it relaxes us; they make them with potpourri so we can relax.
