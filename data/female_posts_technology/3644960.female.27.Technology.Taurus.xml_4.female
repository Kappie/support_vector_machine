Does everyone else out there besides me just love all these shows?  I mean who is watching them?  Everyone I talk to is sick of them, but they must get ratings and to get ratings there have to be viewers.  I'm convinced that the Nielsen Rating boxes that are randomly sent to households throughout America have all collected in a midwestern trailer park (I'm from the midwest, I can say that).  Where Jerry Springer and Reality Shows are more coveted than the Super Bowl.  The one shining star I've found in this summers line-up are the re-runs of "Sex and the City" on TBS, but that's a rare weekly treat.  The rest of the week I fill the void left by TV with books.  Any kind of book I can get my hands on.   No genre is off limits (except those cheesy romance novels, I just can't take a book with a picture of Fabio on the cover seriously)  And speaking of Fabio, does anyone remember the finale of "Average Joe 2 - Hawaii"?  Who breaks up with someone because they dated Fabio, then again, who dates Fabio.  I think I just answered the question of who watches these shows...
