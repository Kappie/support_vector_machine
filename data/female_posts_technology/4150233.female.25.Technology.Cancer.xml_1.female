Talk about tech ..and not so well versed with the latest get wary! is that intimidating sometimes? yes, it is! This has been just an attempt on my part to do something that i always wanted to..pen down what i feel....or to be more precise..type down what i feel. What is technology ? Ah! What a silly question ,u might ponder? But can technology be really defined only in terms of what we see, what the binary can do..or to what extent the science evolves. Being a part of this tech era,I always have felt that probably theres' nothing better than technology that has ever happened to mankind! Simply because , life is more simple, more evolved or to say more busy! Technology has changed the whole scene from the abascus days to the days of pocket pc's! Doesnt it seem like an entire life can be embedded in a tiny chip? Wat say?
