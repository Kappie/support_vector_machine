What makes Harini Smile... 1.  A warm hug from someone who I believe is a good friend and understands me! 2.  Sentimental mail about life, maybe a touch ironic, but yet realistic! 3.  A Smile on someone else's face because of what I did for them. 4.  A joke which has no hard feelings, yet light hearted enough to make me feel the warmth of the joke! 5. A pleasant surprise...!  So all those out there trying to bring a smile to my face, well, this is the way to go!
