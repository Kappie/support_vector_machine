Don't really like the feeling of being zonked out every single day. Went SPLISH SPLASH yesterday. Hmm.. not reallly splish splash... more sun and lazing around the entire afternoon. Relaxing day. Back to another busy day today. Tuition day. Gonna be another long session I guess. Shall try to make it short and sweet. Seriously over spent this week! Unbelievable! Really have to cut it down... Or I'll never reach my target! No matter how many tuitions I do. Oh Man! I need a better job! Or maybe I need a C.A.R.E.E.R.!
