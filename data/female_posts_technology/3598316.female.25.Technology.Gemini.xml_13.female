But on the other hand it's pretty depressing...people ask "oh so where are you going" or "what are you doing with your time off"...and I say "nowhere" or "nothing". Why does going places have to be so expensive? I wish I could just get up and go to the mountians by myself for 3 days, how cool would that be? But instead I am sitting on my couch watching my cats attack eachother. However, I am not complaining. I have my new apartment (which is fabulous) and food in the fridge.....come one people what more do you need? I think I might go to Sylvan lake with sister and her boyfriend on Saturday, but the thing is Pud is coming back that day. I will work it out. Sister is awesome...she took her dogs for a walk and I meet her, and she had a card and a couple gift certificates for me. Oh sister, you rock. I really needed to have someone show that they care and have my back!  MMmmmmm, I just had a wonderful breaky of fresh blueberries and cream. seriously people this is what I call bliss!  I am watching this documentary on a fella called John List. How disturbing...he killed his wife, mother and three kids but he feels he shouldn't have gone to prision. What the heck??! He took off and they couldn't find him for 20 years, and he remarried etc. can you imagine marrying someone then finding otu after they killed their family? disgusting. He says they will forgive him when he goes to heaven. Some people I don't understand.  Well, I don't really have anything interesting to say, I am just typing for the sake of typing.  Crack Anyone?   urlLink         DO you love it?   Great Thanks Dickalee
