Its not that I do not want to talk about how mine was born but I dont because I hate the thought of mentioning the kids dad at their house. For one I think its disrepectful, for two, I just dont want to talk about it if their dad is concerned.  I just wish , I could have attributed to this family in that way.  No one understands that I when I had the kids the only people I had here was Terry and his mother.  In other words I had a man who did not want the babies to be born and his mother who agreed with him.  She never liked children and did not want her son to have any.   I listen to them on how they all had husbands who wanted babies and I hear how the family was there for them, I love listening to the stories.  I started to tell a couple of mine, and I know they love my kids, but its just different.  You know I thought I was jealous when it came this.  But I am not, I am just sad.  I do wish I could of had that.  I still ask though, how come no one wants me to have their baby?  What is wrong with me?
