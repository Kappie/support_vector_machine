I'm going to a wedding this weekend (Yay Rafael and Alice!) and I wanted to get a sweater or shawl to wear over my dress in the church.  Anyway, my punk rocker/hippie outfit got quite a few stares at the fancy dress shops in Bellevue Square.  I ended up making a quick wardrobe change while I was in a dressing room.  I switched to just wearing the tank top underneath.  I totally caved in to social pressure, but I don't like to be stared at in that obnoxious way.  It reminds me of this time in 7th grade when I wore purple and white striped jean cutoff shorts with a tanktop that had some flowers in the middle.  Apparantly "Duh! Flowers and stripes SO don't go together."  Had to turn my shirt inside out that day...  Some things never change.  Oh yeah, and Everwood was great tonight.  I think next episode Amy and Ephram are going to kiss.  My favorite character is actually Amy's older brother.  He's the only one that doesn't have any issues and he pretends to be mean, but he's really always doing nice things for everyone.  Got another card from my mom :-)
