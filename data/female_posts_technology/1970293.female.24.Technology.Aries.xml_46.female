The wizard enjoyed the view below of tiny villages and towns. He knew the dragon didn't mind giving him a ride. They have been friends for such a long time.   "Where exactly did you want to go?" Trellian called back as he flew through some low lying clouds.  Bardric wiped off his face and considered. "I guess drop me off at Tintown. I heard the most turmoil lies in that direction." The wizard yelled back hoping the air didn't blow his words away.  "Tintown it is. That is such a strange place to be though. No one could ever tell me why they called it Tintown to begin with. Then again every time someone sees me, they seem to scream and run away. Strange." The dragon replied as he changed directions to head towards Tintown.   "Maybe they thought they would have to feed you." Bardric yelled as he clutched his pack a little tighter as the dragon swooped towards the ground.  "Like I said, strange." Trellian flew just above treetops as he looked for the telltale signs of Tintown. Of course he was also scaring away all of the folk in that area.
