In bed at night, I'd close my eyes and see the shapes falling.. As hard as I tried, I couldn't get those shapes out of my head,   It's happening again. I'm obsessed.  Riding my car to work - I'm doing it in my head - blogging.  In the gym - blogging.  A funny conversation over lunch - blogging.  In bed - thinking of something blog worthy for tomorrow.   It's Tetris all over again...
