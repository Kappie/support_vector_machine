Sounds like it could be a fun event, and if it isn't at least there is a bar there. I'll be at swimming class (I'm trainng for a sprint (mini) triathlon), but want to hear some good stories about what I miss.  Wahoo! Anna   Tuesday, July 20  Fast Dater presents Singles Fast-Tag Party at The River Caf√©, 3615  Montrose Blvd. A creative way to meet other Houston singles. Just  bring a picture of yourself, or have one taken at the party, and have  fun. Let others discreetly know you would like to meet them via the  Picture Wall of Fame, and others will do the same. Bring your  friends...you never know who you will meet. There will be door prizes,  palm readings and a lot of fun. R.S.V.P.'s are mandatory.  rkratz@fastdater.com or  http://houstonupcomingeventslist7.c.topica.com/maacsKfaa8wZ6bfNV4VbafpKht/  7 p.m.
