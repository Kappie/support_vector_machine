I think largely a lot of this is about Derreck....and I'm SO tired of it. I'm tired of feeling one way or another about him. I expected him to get in touch by now. At least to say hello. Maybe he is waiting for me to...since I didn't call him on his birthday. WHY am I letting this whole situation affect my moods...a man that I'm not even sure is right for me.  Then I feel like a low down person because I'm not TRULY happy for any of the people that are in relationships right now. I dread Rochal coming back in tomorrow and monopolizing the Internet computer writing her man these long soliloquys. I don't even feel like talking to my mother because everytime I look up, she's running over to Jay's little cramped, messy condo. She has a house. Why does she have to be up over there all the time---because he has a life and she doesn't? She isn't even making an effort to make friends anymore. You know what---all this is just jealousy and I really hate myself for feeling this way. A good person would be happy for others when they find love. It should give you hope....not fill you with resentment. I really don't like this about myself. But I'm human and at least I can admit that I have this problem. That's half the battle.  I'm meeting Mark tomorrow for drinks...a potential new fuck buddy. I'm not even really looking forward to it. For one, I just feel socially awkward around men in general. And two...I don't know, probably because of Derreck. My heart belongs to him. I feel like my body does too in a way. So maybe I should just go through with this so that I can take that "part ownership" away from Derreck. Besides, I haven't slept with another man in 2 years. I'm not used to anything else.  Sigh...this is a FUCKED up entry. I'm really deep in the shithole today.
