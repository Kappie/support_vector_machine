So the barbeque at J's house was fun, but he was overly generous in the wine he offered me. I'm going to be talking to my doctor about this, but it seems that if I have more than two drinks I end up nauseous for several days afterwards. I'm sure that can't be a good thing, please don't let it be my kidney.  I only have one kidney, though by now it's increased in size enough that I can hold my water as well as anyone. Despite being born well past my due date, my right kidney had never properly formed. At five my kidney became infected and had to be removed. Then at six I had another operation to adjust a tube in my bladder to ensure proper drainage. The second operation was much harder on me than the first and apparently I spent several days in the ICU, but I remember nothing of it. My childhood was plaqued with continous urinary infections and I was told I should not swim in chlorine-treated water, a harsh sentence to take when you're ten. But here I am now, healthy as anything for the most part and doing my best to take care of my precious remaining kidney. Without it I would be subject to dialysis machines for hours at a time, several days a week.  Oh and for my readers from Freddy Beach, I've heard there is a free yoga class Monday evenings at the lighthouse on the green. Sorry, I haven't heard what time it is held.
