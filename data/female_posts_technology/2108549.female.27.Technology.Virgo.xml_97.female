I wrote and had published 2 articles for the self help web site for our employees. And for as stressed out as I was at the beginning of the job, I am already bored. I am hoping to get involved in some projects to learn some new skills and if nothing else, to have some to put on my review.  Home: Ju and I are still hanging out quite a bit and I have been hanging with my upstairs neighbors also.  We have been working on a vegetable garden in Ju's back yard. Today was tilling and a little planting. I am dog tired and finally clean but it feels good to have stuff that is gonna grow this summer.  Freedom: Is doing well, all the tests have been inconclusive or good results so.... no idea what is wrong with him. Perhaps his is just high maintenance. :)   I think that is everything. Things are just crazy busy and I have decided its time to cut back a little on the things I am involved in. I feel too pulled in far too many directions and like I don't have enough time for anything or anyone so its time to cut back some.
