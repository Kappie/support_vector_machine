Breakfast - egg bun with butter (I've gotta do grocery shopping) Lunch - Wendy's mandarin salad with maybe 1/4 of the dressing that comes with it (250 calories for dressing! I don't think so!) Dinner - small portion of roast beef, carrots, peas Snack - almost a full quart of blueberries (mmmmm) and some yogurt Exercise - 1/2 hour of stretching, sit ups, and arm weights.
