She's been really good this weekend, there are lots of activities planned to keep her occupied, and I've already spoken with one of the camp supervisors to explain her unique personality so hopefully everything will go smoothly.  I can't wait to surprise her with a new Spongebob Squarepants lunchbox tomorrow, and I've promised to take her to the new Pricess Diaries 2 movie on Saturday if she's been good all week. It's just nerve-wracking knowing that she'll be 30 minutes away if anything goes wrong, and there's no real backup child care setup if I need it.  I've offered to keep my sister here for the two weeks following this week to babysit because the day camp is not available then. She'll get room and board, be away from my parents for a bit, and make $150; I think that's a good deal for a 14-year-old. She seems somewhat unsure about the offer. I guess I can understand that she wants to be around her friends in the summer, but with society today shouldn't material wants way overshadow that?
