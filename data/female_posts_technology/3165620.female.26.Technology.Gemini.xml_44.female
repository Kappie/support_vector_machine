It's located pretty close to where Buck is now, within walking/biking distance of campus for him, not much farther away from KAFB than where I am now (just in a different direction). The owners live just a few blocks away and have taken really good care of the place. Anyway, we didn't have high hopes of getting it, since several other people had expressed interest in it before us, but today I had a message from the owner and when I called him back he said we can rent it. Yay! I think we must have been bumped up the list since there are only two of us, we aren't undergrads, and we have no pets.  It has three bedrooms, which is more than we really need, but I'm sure we'll find a use for the extra space. It might be good for Buck to have his own personal office where he can work on his thesis at odd hours, and I'm daydreaming about having a dedicated yarncrafting space. There are a couple of big trees in the backyard, so we'll have nice shade outside. The next-door neighbor is a cop; I imagine having a police car parked over there might deter criminals on that block a bit. There is a nice neighborhood park about two blocks away.  You all get to find out about this before Buck does, since he's en route to that class right now. I sent him an email to let him know we don't have to worry about find housing anymore.
