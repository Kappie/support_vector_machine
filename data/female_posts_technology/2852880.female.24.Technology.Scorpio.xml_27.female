The best part of the DVD was the special feature where you learn a hip-hop dance right in your own home.  (Sorry to all y'all who missed out by seeing it in the theatre!)  For some reason I was pretty giddy this morning and I just broke into the dance in my bedroom, and I totally got it!  It was crazy because I was totally struggling when I was doing it with the dancers on the DVD but I totally got it this morning.  Totally.  I wonder if people will believe that I actually learned a hip-hop dance from the Honey DVD.
