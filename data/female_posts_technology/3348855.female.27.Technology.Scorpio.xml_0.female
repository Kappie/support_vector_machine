I must certainly have looked confounded for quite unnecesarily he expounded words I wished he wouldn't have spoken wounds I wished he wouldn't have opened  All the turmoil - I know I bolted into the temporary respite of sounds and sights a crowd had gather around to cheer an honest street artist conquer his fears.
