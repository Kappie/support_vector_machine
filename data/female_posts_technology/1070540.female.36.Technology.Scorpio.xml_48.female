He told me it was Richard.  But I am not that Niave.    His heart was beating like a little boy who just got caught doing something wrong.   I asked him, but he said it was Richard.   He normally doesnt leave the room when he is on the phone.   Then we went down stairs to wait for his parents to show. I grabbed his phone cause mine was dead and we were radioing them on it.  I opened it up to radio them and he had deleted all of the phone numbers.  Why would he do that if it was Richard.  It had to be her?  My heart hurts so much.  I do not know what to do.  I know what she wrote in LiveJournal is about him..again I am not Niave.  And it says she could fuck him right through the phone and that she is in love with him, and they talk on the telephone.  I wonder if he loves her.  My heart feels like it is tearing apart everyday.  I try to act as if nothing is wrong.  But....I try to show him how much I love him, so he wont forget.  Its like I am waiting for him to come to me and tell me that he is leaving.  When we make love, I know I am not that good cause I am worrying..will this be my last time?  I want to treasure it.  I know I mess up.  I started crying the other day when we were making love. He asked me why?  I told him it was because I love it.  and that is the truth, but its was really because I love him so much and am scared if loosing him!   He is all I ever wanted and needed in a man a love and a friend.  What do I do????????????
