Anyway, I've revised my wishlist....removed Coach Wallet because I got it, and removed the Max Brenner dessert because, well, its a given that I'll visit when I go to the Philippines.  For those who are about the pics of the places, they're pictures of places I want to go to...and there's a description if you point your mouse over it.
