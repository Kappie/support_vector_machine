Yes) so I was preparing for it its almost since hrs I am on my fell constantly... so I will write tommorrow night I promise... Keep up ur good job girls though I dont write I keep watching the blog everyday and I know whats happening about me though I slacked from my rigorows routine I had last week I have lost 2lbs total 6 todate I think its fair enough!!!! Confession: I ate one chese stick from fridge today(which elisa had left)
