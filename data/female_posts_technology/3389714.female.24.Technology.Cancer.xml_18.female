I remember having a cream cheese mustache ..and running away when G masi tried to wipe it off..haha..now I’d die of embarrassment if I was caught in public with cream cheese pasted on my face…we’ll I left my car double parked and prayed I didn’t get ticketed and ran into the bagel shop…the owner had aged dramatically…but still had that quirky smile… he asked me what I wanted..and once again I said “cinnamon raisin bagel with tons of raisins lightly toasted with a bit of cream cheese” he smiled at me and started digging though his basket…I’m utterly happy today and I thank that bagel shop on Washington street for putting a smile of my face…MUHAAA…   Question of the Day:   How do you like your bagel? (toasted, butter, cream cheese, jelly)
