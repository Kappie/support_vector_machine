I've been a full-fledged ultrasound tech for a little over a year now, and I've already come up with a repertoire of comments and things that you: a)should never say or b)should never ask  Now, I realize that having an ultrasound can produce a variety of emotions - from pain to embarrasment to joy, and so if you are an offender under either a) or b), it's okay.  I don't hate you.  I'm just trying to prevent future misunderstandings from happening.  First of all: 1./  Don't tell me that your bladder is full when it's not.  I can tell when you're lying.  I'm the one taking the pictures, remember?? 2./  Don't tell me that your fasting when you've eaten bacon and eggs for breakfast.  I can figure that one out, too. 3./  Please don't fart on me.  I know that gas happens, but there is absolutely NO need to squeak one out on my leg. 4./  Please don't ask me the gender of your baby when you are only 8 weeks pregnant.  I'm good, but I'm not THAT good. (For your information, this is best determined around the 20 week mark, or even later, and even then we can't see things, due to fetal position) 5./  I know that when you are fasting, your breath tends to become fetid.  However, fasting doesn't mean that you can't brush your teeth.  Just don't eat the tube of toothpaste.  And please, when I tell you to let your breath out, don't blow it in my face. 6./  When you are told to leave your underwear on, please do so. 7./  For the men.  Truly, we don't enjoy scanning your testicles.  It's just as embarrasing for us as it is for you.  So, comments like "Thanks for being so genital with me!" are not really appreciated.  I could go on, but I'll save them for another bloggy day.  Okay, now, I don't mean for any of this to sound cruel.  Just some little snippets of information to take to heart.  And, in case you were wondering...we truly ARE all shades of grey inside.  At least, in my world we are. =)  -J.
