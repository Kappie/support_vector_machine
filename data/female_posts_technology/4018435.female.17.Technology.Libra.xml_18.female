We really dont' care how childish it is because it's not if you dare and truth the right tpye of things. Like Tom...he jumped into the pool at 11 pm naked...we only told him to jump in the pool...he did the naked part on his own...Candice knows I hate beer so I stuck to my vodka and pepsi.When's the last time i had that either? Hmm...I dont even remember the garbage I said or did two hours ago...that can't be good. I hate being an easy drunk!                   Mom made banana muffins today and I took sum to work. Yum...fresh home made goodness... Anywho, there were a bunch of retard kids that walked into the store asking us shit questions and being retards when they were probably my age and older. I fucking hate kids like that. I told my manager how much I hate seeing people my age act like shit heads and he said "you should have said to them -why are you guys being retards?- and if they said anything to me about what you said I'd say, -she didn't say that. what are you talking about?- and i don't think the rest of the customers in the store would have cared if you said anything." lol i should have sid sumthin to them damn it!                   MWAHAHA! cna you believe we're picking up the Turbo Talon tomorrow!? I can't wait! VrooomPSSSHT! I love that noise of the blow off valve....taht thing is so cool....it's gonna scare the shitty ricers in my neighbourhood. I hate it when they try racing the benz...it's like "okay...we're not racing you" so when they drive off when the light turns green and we just mind our own business, what does it prove? Honestly...stupid cambridge kids...                    I get paid....omg it's 1 am! that means I got paid! Woohoo! I better check how much money I have...it'll probably be zero by tomorrow....yeah...i owe my mom and my brother money....damn it.                    I went to Karate and got my hair cut today. How great. It felt nice having my hair fixed up! Paul is the greatest guy ever. The sensei and the hair stylist all in one....though he hasn't taught me for 4 years. But man, Kelly taught me some new moves in class today...it completely threw me off from the old style to the new style...now i know why I can't wear my red belt anymore since I last taught there...I'm a white belt again! *Cries* nah, actually it's cool. It's neat that I have another goal to get to again.                     Guess i'm off to bed now. No i will NOT wake up to a hangover nor am I drunk anymore...so...I'm gonna go wash my face, get changed, brush my teeth and all that junk. Nighty Night!
