Did a lot of singing as usual.  Everyone is always wanting me to sing.  I love it though. Was out real late or early however you look at it.  I still have that guy from a band I tried out for calling me.  That whole band wants me so bad, but I just didn't feel it w/ them. (if that makes any sence) Although, this whole Jetless thing is really going nowhere presently. Can never get everyone together to jam.  The drummer is out of the country. I really want to be part of this, but truthfully I hope I am not wasting my time. I really get the feeling that Anne is not gone, and I am going to get brushed aside some how.  I hope that's not what is going on, but it is in the back of my head. I feel as though this has a lot of potential. I had a wake today. Yes another one! Mrs F, a old friend of the family.  She was 96. She saw it all let me tell you. Went to dinner w/ my parents and now dealing w/ this fricking eye infection that I have. Now I need to get to sleep.
