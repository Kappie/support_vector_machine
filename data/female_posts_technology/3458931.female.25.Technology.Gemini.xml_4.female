It was the day I was scheduled to write my exam for my Cisco CCNA certification. I had just ended a relationship about a month earlier but was pretty career focused at the time and wasn't really thinking much about dating.   I passed my exam (the results are instant)! Oh joy, oh bliss! Excited, I walked up to the reception desk to get the printout of my test scores. There he was, standing at the secretary's desk. I thought he was kinda cute looking, but I also thought he was trying to get a date with the secretary - he was nagging her to go get some lunch with him. We exchanged some words, he congradulated me on my exam, and I left.   I got just as far as the elevator when I realized I had left my purse in the testing room. I walked back to the school and got my bag, M was still there bothering the secretary for a date. When I left M followed, we chatted some more in the elevator on the way from the 8th floor to the ground floor. I was really hoping he was going to offer to take me to lunch to celebrate my success, but he didn't.   And that was it, that was our first meeting. Fate brought us together again later on, but we both remembered that first meeting very clearly. Oh, and it turned out he wasn't hitting on the secretary. He worked in an office adjacent to hers and they had been close friends for some time. He later told me he really had no reason to take the elevator at that time, other than the fact that he was interested in me, and he also wished he had asked me out to lunch!
