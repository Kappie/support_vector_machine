Went to  urlLink Target  last night and bought a new bathing suit - it was brutal.  I also got some more exercise wear since I am still rocking the  urlLink Karen Voight  tape after work.  Feel like I am toning up but the bathing suit thing bummed me down to zero.  Nothing like seeing your body exposed to make you feel like a hog on ice.  So I get up this morning and there's my  urlLink horoscope .  Pretty profound stuff and maybe I should meditate on that a bit.
