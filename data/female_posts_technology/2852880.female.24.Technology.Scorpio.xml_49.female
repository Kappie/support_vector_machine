But I did get the most fabulous orange purse today.  It has these little circles on it!  It'll be perfect for Princeton Reunions.  B seems really stressed out these days.  He has so much work to do.  Hopefully he'll get it done by this weekend so we can have fun together.  Reunions can be a little weird for us as a couple because, although our friends overlap, we also have 2 entirely different sets of friends.  I know his and he knows mine, but our priorities are different for who we want to spend time with.  It's not a problem.  Basically we split up for some of the time.  Even though we don't see each other that much because of long distance, we only see these people like once a year at reunions.  I think it's good for us - it forces more of a healthy balance.  I bet B doesn't even think about it or analyze it or anything.  He's more of a "go with the flow" kind of person.  That makes me the over-analytical one.  Last night I went with Karen to see Urinetown at the Paramount.  I thought it was really good, although it's weird to watch a show about urine.  The puns were hilarious, as one might imagine.  My favorite was Freedom/FreeTum song when they wanted to have free toilet access.  Karen and I had Mexican food beforehand and we couldn't decide what makes a Mexican restaurant authentic.  I think it needs to be a little grungy.  Like Gorditos!  This entry is getting too long to the point that people won't read it.  Right, because I have such a large readership...  I'm late for Kells.  It's Chris Dickens' birthday!  I gotta represent.
