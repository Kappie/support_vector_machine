Why the definition of 'old-fashion' because the new generation, like my sister's idea of Nasi Lemak, is a must-must have fried chicken/wings and normal omelette comes in a form of sunny-side up.  I actually miss 'those days' Nasi Lemak that comes in small packets wrap with banana leaves on top of old newspaper  . I remembered watching my ma in the morning wee hours doing it, to be sold to fellow workers in nearby factory. Going at 50 cents/packet, that humbly contained the 'rich' rice, sambal, triangular-cut omelette, and alternate with either ikan selar or anchovies+peanuts.  Back 2 MIL's Nasi Lemak. I am a real 'sucker' for her Sambal Tumis. Its super, duper HOT  , that can drove me to sheer tears, but its super REFRESHING that I always ask for more.   'Camping' @ PIL's went on fine. We hit Central, which as ever, endlessly crowded. Mak Jah and Pak Mat was looking for a new rice-cooker. From Metro, to Isetan, to Best Denki, still no rice-cooker. Instead, they bought for us a belated housewarming gift, a deep-fryer. Hmmmmm I was thinking more of my favorite home-made breaded fish with no grease splattering around.  In the end, Mak Jah settled with the Tiger rice-cooker @ Isetan. Exactly same model as ours. It seems Tiger brand is his family-favourite brand of rice-cooker. My MIL, his aunties, his cousins all are proud owners of Tiger brands. It's undeniably good, because No 1, its durability. Most of their Tigers aged almost 10 years. Gee, ours still a baby, only 4 months old. No 2, after 3 days, cooked rice in Tiger, still as good as fresh. And there is nothing like 'kerak-kerak', thus easy to wash it spiffy clean. Perhaps let me put it to a 7 days test, yahhhhh.  So much for the weekend, finally we are back in the comfy of our humble shack. Ahhhhh ... I love it. The bathroom is still freshly scented after my Saturday-morning scrub. I'd actually used up almost a whole bottle of our favorite essential oil,  Calm Oil Home Fragrance  Calm Water Home Fragrance Oil to use as  urlLink scented final rinse  on the bathroom's vanity top and kitchen's top. So hubby, please remind me to grab those from BodyShop, or else you claim you won't be able to do your 'sole proprietor business'   in soothing, serene, pristine environment. Hahahhh!  I could see from here that hubby seems bored because he kept changing channels. We were done with X-men earlier. And his favorite 'Metropolitan' had such a shock ending. So I just shouted to hubby,  "Pirates of Carribean?!" "OK!"  Time to catch-up on bought-but-unwatch DVDs *nearing Monday morning?*. Ohh to kill time before the 3.05am Copa America Final.
