Her eyes spoke of a time of great joy but also a time with great misery and hardship.  A woman who knew the value of a word and yet knew nothing of living a happy life filled with joy and laughter.  I could see the laughter lines on her face and yet I realized how old they must have been for this woman no longer laughed at the joy of living.  I realized I pitied this woman.  I also realized that I could be this woman in the future.  With a few bad choices, it would be so easy for me to turn into her.  I didn't want that but yet I realized this woman never wanted that.  What could have happened in this woman's life to cause her so much pain.  Then it came to me.  It had to be love.  Love is the only power on this earth to cause this much pain and yet still have joy in a few moments between the pain.  Would I have the strength to do what this woman did not do or would I freeze before making a decision.  I hope such a decision never befalls me.  I slowly closed the door of the dark brown casket on the woman, barely thirty, who died by her husband's angry hand.  A senseless death indeed.
