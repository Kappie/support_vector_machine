I remember when the ice cream man used to come down our street.  It took some skill to actually be able to get ice cream.  The guy was really fast.  Basically, as soon as we heard the bell-like music, one of us would book out the door to stop the guy.  Another would run upstairs to beg for money off my mom.  Another would slowly walk towards the ice cream man stalling while the upstairs negotiation took place.  It took at least 3 people.  I liked to be the one who ran out and stopped the guy because then you have the longest time to pick out what you want, but my siblings and I took turns.  It was the worst when my mom said no and we had to let the ice cream man drive away leaving us empty handed.  Sometimes we had some backup change just in case.  At middle school, the ice cream man would be waiting behind the big row of buses when school got out.  He was there every day in the springtime.  Unfortunately, the buses never waited long enough for you to get ice cream.  If you wanted to make your bus without ice cream you probably had to have your bag packed before your 8th period class.  If you needed to go to your locker, you pretty much had to flat-out sprint to make the bus.  I was lucky enough to be friends with Eddie Anderson.  Eddie was the best.  He didn't have an 8th period class, or maybe he had gym.  Either way, he had time to go to the ice cream man.  So every morning, I'd give him my money and tell him what I wanted.  Did I tell you how awesome this was?!  Eddie was totally cute, by the way.  If I only had like 40 cents, he'd tell me what I could get with that amount of money.  Usually, I'd give him 35 cents to get a cherry Italian ice.  Every once in a while, I'd do the run for us.  What an amazing time that was!  Ah...the ice cream man.
