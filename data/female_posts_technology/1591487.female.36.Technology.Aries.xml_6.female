Or maybe they have noticed but feel too embarrassed for me to say anything.  If that's the case, then they must be embarrassed for me for much of the time, as they hardly say anything to me, anyway.  Although to be fair we did have a brief conversation this afternoon about the merits of movie violence.  And I did comment the other week to one of my co-workers that we never have conversations that last longer than 10 minutes, he brought in a stop watch the following Monday.   We made it to 15 minutes, however, I mentioned that this was because the pressure was on and it felt forced.  Do you think that you can sustain a relationship with someone with which you have an average of two conversations a day that last only 10 minutes each? I'm not sure, because I quite like him. Perhaps it would be good practice for when we have been married for years and years, we'd have no place to go but up in terms of conversation time? It's a thought.  Anyway, I'm wearing the same shirt because I'm currently house-sitting and trying to bring the whole wardrobe with you is virtually impossible.  I never plan what I'm going to wear on a given day and accessorising is definitely on a whim. Has watching too much Video Hits over the weekend inspired me to wear the big hoop earrings today? Or shall I be demure and not wear any earrings? Shall I wear furry scarf no. 2 or shop bought scarf no. 27?   When you don't have these choices at hand dressing is limited. So I'm having to improvise with the things I could fit into one washing basket.  Clearly I didn't calculate enough underpants for the duration of the stay too.  I really should think these things through.
