Its a little more, ok a lot more, than I wanted to pay every month but its almost kitty corner to Ju's place, 2 bedrooms and I can have Freedom.  We'll see, I turned in an application because they weren't requiring an app fee sooooo maybe I'll get it.  I can swing it financially, it would just be tighter than I wanted it to be.  But it would be safe and its freshly remodeled and I love it.  So I've done the footwork and if I an supposed to get it, God will provide the rest.
