We were in line for about an hour, but it was still worth it , we rode from the Veterans' Administration Hospital at Fort Snelling to the Metrodome in downtown Minnapolis. Then we rode the city bus back to the VA to get our car, and go home. Somewhat hypocritical of us, since we never ride the bus any more.  Last week end we took our kids to downtown St Paul to watch the "Grand Excursion" paddle boats come in from Davenport (LA? IA?) but as soon as the first one appeared, it started pouring rain and we had to take our kids home!  The next day was Sunday, the Fourth of July, and it didn't rain that day, for a change, and we took our kids swimming at Long Lake, a city beach near our house and we had a blast and got sunburned in a relatively short amount of time!  Two days ago, Saturday, we took our kids to downtown Minneapolis, to see They Might Be Giants play a free children's show in front of Orchestra Hall. The whole big plaza was full of alt-rock parents dragging their very confused children behind them becuase it was the parents who wanted to see TMBG, not the kids! My 10 year old daughter whined the whole time, and my 5 year old son spent all his time playing with my hair.  Saturday night my friend Debi had her cook-out in her back yard. It was so great. 3 people there now work in an office I USED to work in, and it was fun to hear the gossip and grill hamburgers and roast marshmellows for s'mores on the embers! She filled a little rubber wading pool with water and we called it a pool party.  Yesterday, Sunday, I took my son to a sign-language Catholic church in North Minneapolis. It was odd for me to take my son to Church, when it's my husband who is the Catholic, and I'm the athiest. But I'm trying to take advanage of every free opportunity to improve my sign language and that's one thing I can say for visiting churches, its free. My son spent the whole time alternately climbing on me, going limp, and humming his own little repetitive tunes to himself. I'm sure everyone there thought he was retarded. I'll take pity over hostility any day!  The free sign language group I've been meeting with for an hour or two on Friday nights at a local Barnes and Nobels book store have been really helpful, as well as the Friday sign-language lunches I've been having with co workers, 2 of whom are deaf.  Back at my desk at work right now. Chatting to strangers over my IM, at my desk. Taking phone calls from users. Today I might find out if my old friend gets the job here, that he interviewed for, over a week ago. That would be so great!  I submitted my application for part time work at Barnes and Nobels this week-end. So that makes Sam's Club, Target, and BN that I have applied to for a 2nd job. Each place says that they probably won't be looking for more part timers until their summer students go back to school in the fall. My husband and I are in a contest to see who can get a part-time job first. Who ever loses has to stay home with the kids while the other person works.
