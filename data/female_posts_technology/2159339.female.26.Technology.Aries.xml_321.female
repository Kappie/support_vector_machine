My boss emailed me an extremely condescending email this morning about how I should not think about getting promoted any time soon, that it will happen "some day. Trust me.”  Fat Bitch! There are about 5 different sentences in the email that are not only offensive, but also plain mean, and I'm requesting a meeting with HR to go over my options (i.e. transferring into another group). Shit, what if HR ask to meet today and smell me and decide that I'm too dirty to be promoted? Oh lord, why me? Why?? AND!! I told my mom about the email and she said "Just listen to your boss. One day you will be boss. Others listen to you." Don't give me this immigrant bullshit, mom! What happened to fighting for what you believe in? I'm so watching Rocky IV tonight to pump myself up and then composing a polite yet resolute retort to my boss's email which I then may or may not send.  Damn, there’s the smell again! I don't have shit on my shoes and my hair is clean. It must be the non-express bus I took this morning. I think I contracted the smell of the dirty hobo that was sitting behind me. Gross.
