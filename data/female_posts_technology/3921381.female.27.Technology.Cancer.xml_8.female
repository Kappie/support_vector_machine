"birth defect" he says. thanks dr.  anyhoo, of course i want to be better. i'll go for better health, long life. besides insurance is paying for it due to the accident. its all good besides my lack of good sleep or sleep......period.  Thank you God and Jesus for the fact that i can still walk, breathe, eat normally and have full use of my five senses!  amen.
