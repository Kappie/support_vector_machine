I took my first class back at karate in a couple years. Felt great. I'm looking forward to designing the new Demo Team Uniform for my sensei.   I went out with Kevin to work today so I could preorder a Street Fighter Action Figure (Yes I'm a dork). I talked to Amanda for a bit today. She let out sum steem from the stuff she's going through. Be strong Amanda, you can do it.    Y'know how people say that you can tell peopel are happier and healthier when in a relationship? It's true. Cuz right now I'm obviously not healthy.... it's not good. I dont know what's wrong with my system but it's not being too kind at all.  I talked to mike's sister. Thank goodness I could talk to her. She's so different from the rest of her and mike's family. She told me that she'd tell mike that I want to talk to him one last time if it's really over. Thank you Again.    I don't really know what to write right now...I'm not feeling too well...I feel like someone stabbed a screwdriver through my chest while they shoved a pindone down my throat to choke on.... Amanda and Kevin wanna take me out to Sportsworld tomorrow. I want to go but at the same time I don't. I really need to get stuff done in the house. I started clearing out some of the basement in order to fit the boxes that i keep under my bed, downstairs instead. I guess I'm not going to the Phillippines. But that also means that since I'm not going, my parents will have sum sort of money to help me fix my room. Can't wait for that.  Shane and Ben want me to go to the anime convention with them this year....I wanna go but I don't...  Shawn called me from Winnipeg today. I couldn't help but cry. It was so good to hear his voice. No one has a best friend like I do. He's so good to talk to.   Candice wants to hang out and cheer me up this weekend. It'll be good to see her since I haven't seen her in such a long time.  Asked Katy bout hanging out sum time. Maybe camping or just sumwhere away from here. Hope i get to. I really need to just run and fly away.  I need to write to megan and liz...evil camp people...I miss them.    I'll most likely keep to watching these chick flicks i borrowed from melanie...yep...just add onto the loneliness and depression. yay...   Breathe...Just Breathe...   I don't know what else to write...I'm not feelin so good so I'm just gonna stop here.  -Livin it up  The Lonewolf
