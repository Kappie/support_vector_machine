I just don't think I am cut out for this 9-5 thing. I am too bored, unhappy with the rewards (ie pay, advancement), and unwilling to kiss butt to get ahead.  I look to others who have been able to start their own business. I know  urlLink sinta  is only 20 and she has her own business already.  Very inspirational, at the same time, I ask myself, when can I do the same? I know that I am young, that I haven't 'earned my stripes' so to speak. I have a myriad of things to learn, experience, and struggle with before I can say I don't want to work for a company.  After all, millions of others do it, right?  But I don't want to be like millions of others. I don't want to be in the rat race all my life.  I want to have financial freedom, creative freedom, freedom period.  And sooner, rather than later. My job is, in the big scheme of things, not bad at all.  But I don't want to work for anyone.  I don't want to expend all this energy only for someone else to reap the rewards.  I want it for myself.  I want how hard I work to be directly proportionate to how much I earn, and this can only happen if I was in sales, in which case I'd still be working for somebody to meet their quota...or work for myself.    I have my real estate goals to work toward.  A deal is slowly coming together for me right now that will give me a taste of its reward.  I am young and impatient however, and want to break away right now permanently and go pursue this dream full time.  I can't wait to be able to dictate my own time, set my own goals, set my own quota, have my own office littered with my own stapler, and paper clips, and with my name on a plaque by the door.  Wouldn't it be cool? Wouldn't it be cool to be able to put notices on my answering machine and even on my door, that I'd be closed for a week because I'm off on a vacation with my husband?  One of the dream vacations that is nothing more than a dream to me right now but that I would love to be a reality?  Like that European trip....How sweet to dream...
