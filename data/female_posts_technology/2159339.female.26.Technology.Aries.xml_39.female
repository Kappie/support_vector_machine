I drew XX this cute bunch of bananas to hang in his cubicle, but Monday I was too chickenshh to put it on his desk. Tuesday, he ignored me. Wednesday, wait, today is Wednesday. Wednesday is too late. The bananas have gone bad, so they're going into the bottom of my drawer. I pictured coming by his cubicle to give it to him but in my mind he goes, "What the hell? Fuck you!" as he crumples it into a ball and throws it at my head, where it bounces off and hits the ground nearby. He angrily swivels back to look at his computer as I burst into tears and run back to my desk where I will hide underneath it for the remainder of the day. I cannot show my face. Sneers, jeers, and mocking laughter come from his department. The world becomes hideous so I quit my job and become a wandering vagrant. I smell like poo and old underwear and sometimes I turn tricks so I can feed myself. I don't have teeth either, just a sunken, weather-beaten mien. It is a godless existence...   So... it's good that I'm keeping the bananas.
