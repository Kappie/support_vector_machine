Had a really bad Vic and Shannon week for some reason.  I miss them both and had some crazy dreams about both of them. Got my 2 inches cut off my hair, and put some funky colors in the front.  Collen (my son) has been acting up lately. I lost the job I was given, I got a modeling shoot, but it is in Colorado so I have to pass on it, and not sure what is going on w/ my apt because they called me saying the people who live there may be staying another year! F..ed up week I tell ya.  I have practice this afternoon, but don't know what will happen w/ that cause John just told me to sit tight because he got some message from Jeff (the drummer) I have been in depression mode again.  It does not affect me like most, but with me having Seasonal Affected Disorder I just wish we could skip through the winter.  This winter has been the worst for me yet. I am dealing though. I wrote some lyrics, but I am going crazy because the way I write is so different from the way John writes and I just can't grasp the concept of the way he writes.  AAGGGHHH! I am sure I am missing something but that is about it for the week.
