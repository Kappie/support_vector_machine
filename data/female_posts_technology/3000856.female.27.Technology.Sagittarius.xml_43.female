I kind of went off the deep end on John and Paul yesterday not meaning to.  I think all of us will be better after the 22 is passed and we can just focus on the future and not worry about if Jeff is filling or not! The ironic thing is after I said what I had to say, Anne sent out an email but that is a whole other story. Have to get a CD to that drummer in the next couple of days.  We will see how that turns out. Comcast is finally coming today to hook up my internet.  WOO HOO! Can't even begin to tell you how thrilling that is! Jake is riding w/ me to practice tonight and we will find out if he is filling for the 22 or not! I am getting this little twitch in my right eye.  Does that mean I am going coo coo? LOL I am back in the gym again working out hard.  I should be back into my summer shape by now, and I am just starting.  GEEZE! I should be ok in about 4-5 weeks. Yesterday was just an all together bad day.  I so badly wanted to walk out of work.  No appreciation no matter what I do around here.  I need to stop now, like Jer said yesterday, "this is not a pitty party for Charity" whatever! :-p
