I feel kind of guilty that I haven't taken the initiative to write but life has been totally full these days. I haven't had time to go to movies or take fun trips. I have weird sleeping patterns. I think my brain is tired from tracking all the stuff to do for my move. It's a big change. New apartment, new city, new career, new income level, new roommate, new life. It's a little stressful.    I found a new roommate. Her name is Michelle Pilat from Wisconsin. I googled her but nothing much came up thatseemed to fit her phone personality.She seems really cool. After  urlLink Karen's horror stories about past roommates ,I was picturing awful things, but I'm thinking this is a really good match.    I got a book from my friend, Hunter Allen, in the mail today called "Seedfolk". It's a cute little story.He said itmade him think of me for some reason. And inside the book has this printed sticker that says "One Book, One Community" and something about passing it on. I wonder who I'll give it to, and whether Hunter expected me to pass it on.    I got an iPod yesterday. It's an older model and I got it for free from a friend in Canada. I felt so stupid and was sure it was broken because I couldn't get it to charge up or turn on. Turns out you have to hold down MENU and PLAY to turn it on. And peoplesay Apple has great UI... I definitely could have used a START button.
