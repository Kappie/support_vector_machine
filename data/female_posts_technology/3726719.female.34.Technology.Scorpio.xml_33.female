As it turns out he had no problem finding the Starbucks counter in my local Barnes  Noble.  :o)    Actually we both arrived before the store opened, so we walked in together.  He did buy me my mocha so that was sweet.  B and I had a nice little chat.  He's got a Masters in Chemistry and another one in Organizational Management.  Basically he's a very smart dude.  Doesn't talk in another hemisphere either, which I thought was good.   He's a nice looking man.  The big thing for me was the fact that he looked like, and sounded like, a man and not a little boy.  And I didn't feel more intelligent or more worldly.   I enjoyed our coffee chat time and I think there is potential here.  We'll find out on Saturday evening's outing.
