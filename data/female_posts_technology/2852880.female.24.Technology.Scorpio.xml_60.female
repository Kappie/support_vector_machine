       
      I have so many piles of paper in my apartment that have been accumulating the past few weeks.  Half the time I haven't been home, and when I am home, it's only for a few minutes.  Today my goal is to organize it all.  If anyone has a system that works, please let me know.  Mail, magazines, written notes, receipts, paid bills, waiting-to-be-paid bills, letters.  I did cancel my New York Times subscription because that was just mean to all the trees.  I couldn't keep up with reading all of it.  Anyway, today is paper organization day.  The BoF students are returning home today.  I've added my friend Gaby, from Argentina to my Friends list on the right.  There you can see a picture of the group on a boat cruise and at an elementary school.
