They said they were going to be over around 2:30, so I got up (I am currently working the night shift) at 1:30 and went and got the kids at the babysitters and then waited. At around 3:45 they called and said they were running late and won't be able to make it. Well isn't that lovely. The only good thing about it is I now have a clean house for a day or two. I then had to take the kids back to the babysitters so I could go to work. Duane didn't get off until 7 tonight. So it was basically a waste of a day. If they had of called earlier I would have been able to take the kids right back to the babysitters and got another hours sleep. I can just tell tonight is going to be fun. I am so tired.   On a good note, mom is taking the kids for the weekend and Duane and I are going to moncton with one of my old best friends from high school and her boyfriend whom we worked with at Mcdonalds. This is the first time is like a year that we are going to get to go out and not have to worry about the kids. We are going to have so much fun. We are going to go out on Saturday night and hang out at the beach or go to magic mountain and of course shop.   Tonight is night 4 and I have to do some major studying tonight. My exam is Friday morning. God I hope I get this exam. There is a lot of pressure which sucks, plus I just got a raise last night and now I know I can't disappoint the boss.   see later alligator  Melissa
