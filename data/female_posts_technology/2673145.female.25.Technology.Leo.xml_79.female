Or maybe philosophical stuff are serious, or I can't joke about it? Or I don't know how to take it on a different perspective?  I value your comments, appreciate your concerns and thanks for reading. I will try to improve on that. Otherwise, people will stop coming to my blog. Hahah.. too sad already!  Oh, incase you are wondering, I'm not depress (maybe only when I was writing it).
