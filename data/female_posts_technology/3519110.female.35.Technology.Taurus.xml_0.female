I am a long time, hard core fan of DMB, but I have to say that the mere fact that they have decided to assist in a fund raising event for this a**hole just repulses me. I cannot believe that anyone would be so stupid as to actually support what these people believe in. I mean- accept it- we are in Iraq. Do the people of our country NOT KNOW or understand the cost of freedom isn't just money? Do they no know or understand that the BENEFIT that comes out of that cost is enormous? These jerks seem to take for granted that "Oh yeah, sure- I know people died in wars" but do they not understand that the result of those people dying is the fact that we can live in freedom? That we can say what we want, do what we want, live our lives without fear of retribution from our own government. These people are living contradiction- they want the freedom and everything that goes along with it, but are not willing to pay the price for it. No- our country does not DIRECTLY benefit from it at this very moment, but our decendants will, when they can walk freely in the streets in that country. When all of humankind is treated with dignity, respect and fairness. Freedom is a long, hard process. Support these people who are fighting for it!!! Don't BASH them for giving the gift of their LIVES for someone elses benefit!!
