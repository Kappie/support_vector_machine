Okay. Bastards. They'd better email me back this time.      Yesterday, Ji was trying to tell me that I needed to be friends with Mel because we've been friends for over a decade. Whatever. I told her, "Uhm, no. I don't."       Ji: But, Grace...   Me: Yeah?   Ji: You should call her.   Me: No. I really don't want to. She's so different now, we have nothing in common, she's condescending and judgemental, so no.   Ji: Okay...      hehe. since when did ji turn into the nice girl? sheesh. hehehe. ooh,   i hope our 10 year reunion isn't uncomfortable, though. i keep having friggin' dreams about her stupid wedding. i can't wait until this whole clusterfuck of an event is over!      it's 11:15 sunday... hehe... waiting for julia to call me.... can't wait to hear the scoop on his stupid family. heh.      powerpoint calls. kill me now.
