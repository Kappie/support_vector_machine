All that matters to the higher ups are statistics, that's all. Catch these idiots and put them in our place, doing our job, and I don't think they can survive for even 2 weeks. They don't understand us, coz they're sitting so high up they can only see black specks moving on the ground.  Somebody should take a big club and knock their ass down  Don't be too generous, coz other people ain't gonna be generous to u. Especially not at the work place. That's one of the things i learned for my 1st job here. Anyway, gotta get back to my job, before my beloved boss breathe down my neck.  By da way, I DID NOT get a pay raise, which my boss hinted at weeks ago. It was just a gimmick to make me stay on, I think. Shucks!
