I emailed back and said no I already made plans and I'll see him some other time. I don't ditch my friends for Euro-losers who can't give a girl advance notice about things. I've been planning to see Supersize Me for a week now, and I ain't giving up a popular  and  critically-acclaimed movie to meet some ambivalent doofus at the motherfuckin airport! Know what I'm sayin?!!
