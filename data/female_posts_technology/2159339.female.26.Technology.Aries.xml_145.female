I assumed dear moms would pay for all my purchases, so I piled things up sky high in the cart without giving it much thought - a sexy Target bra, a clutch purse, a toilet cleaner, bath matt, a plant, a race car piñata, a new pot, some Swiffer refills, eye shadow, wooden serving spoon - only the products vital to my happiness  well-being. When we got to the register, she offered to pay, I politely refused, she didn't push it. What in god's name??... I felt robbed! Was this some sick way of her trying to teach me financial responsibility? I couldn't believe it! Especially since she now has a job. She redeemed herself when she gave me money to get sushi with Batty afterwards, but still, had I known that it would be my money blown on useless crap, I wouldn't have gotten so much of it. Anyway, I love my momma and I'm not stepping my foot in Target for the next two months.  After stuffing ourselves at Sushi Tomo, M came over with a big wrapped package. I like to pretend that I'm above gifts and that all I really want is someone kind and sweet who makes me laugh. But please. I've never ripped through anything so fast in my life. I almost peed myself when I saw it.  (http://secure.giantrobot.com/graphics/00000003/uglydoll_cinko.gif)  So fucking cuuuute!!!!   And so very generous and unexpected of M. As we watched cable for the next two hours, I wondered to myself "Is he turning into a mushy, sentimental, gift-giving boyfriend? Do I have to worry about him liking and respecting me from now on? Will he start complimenting me on things other than my bras and underwear?"..I thought back to the conversation I had with Batty on the way to get sushi - she very wisely pointed out that I like men who challenge me and give me the run for my money, which I agree with, but had never thought about in such clear, simple terms. It's true, I like men to disagree with me, argue with me and make me want to kill them. I won't marry this type, of course, but for some reason that's who I find attractive at this point in my life. Call it masochism, I don't care.  Inside my head I panicked at the thought of being in a normal, warm, lovey-dovey type of relationship with M. How can I stop him before he gets too far and ...and... stops talking about Paris Hilton's boobs?!?! At the same time I realized I hadn’t properly thanked him for my gift, so I leaned in to give him a kiss on the cheek. "Ack!! What are you doing? Please don't torment me with your wasabi breath!"..said he. I smiled and put my head on his bony little shoulder.
