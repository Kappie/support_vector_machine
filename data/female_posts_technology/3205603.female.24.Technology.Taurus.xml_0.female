I dreamt of making stars; I was given a planet.”  This was the opening statement given by Dr. Josette Biyo, a public school teacher from Philippine Science High School in Iloilo City, who recently addressed a group of business executives of a top Philippine Company. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory has named a minor planet in her honor; there is now a planet named Biyo, located between Mars and Jupiter.   The secondary school teacher who once dreamed of becoming a doctor made news when she was featured in several national and international newspapers. Having competed with 4,000 other teachers from different countries during the Intel International Science Education Fair at Louisville, Kentucky, USA, last 10-17 May 2002, Dr. Biyo emerged victorious and became the first Asian to be given an Intel Excellence in Teaching Award.   Amidst the recent controversies that have rocked the nation and the difficulties that we face as a people, Dr. Biyo’s story is one which could inspire us. Majority of the Filipinos may have become disgusted with the way things have gotten in the country, blaming the government for every misfortune that falls on them, without realizing that within themselves lies the untapped potentials which could very well help move this country forward.   It was more than two decades ago when, as a BS Biology graduate from UP Visayas, Dr. Biyo took the first job opportunity that was teaching instead of going to medical school, for lack of financial resources. She never regretted the twist of fate for the day she entered the classroom, she knew that she was going to be an excellent teacher. And true enough, twenty three years of dedication and commitment to improving her craft as an educator not only brought her an award but also brought glory to our country.  Early on, Dr. Biyo was exposed to the poverty faced by most of the people in her hometown for she spent her first eight years of teaching in a rural school. Not only was she asked to teach subjects, which were not within her field of study, there was also none of the equipment and facilities she expected in order to make her teaching more effective. These challenges however did not dampen her enthusiasm for the job but instead made her more creative and innovative. It was also during her stint as a rural school teacher when she designed outreach programs in order to instill in her student’s minds that every science concept taught in the classroom should have a social dimension. This experience, among others, has prepared her for greater challenges ahead.   Pursuing higher studies in Manila kept her busy after she resigned from her teaching job. But despite the opportunities for professional growth the metropolis has offered her, she still felt that her heart was in Iloilo. She returned to her province and started working with the Philippine Science High School - Western Visayas. Still faced with similar problems when she first started teaching, Dr. Biyo continuously helped improved the school’s Science Research Curriculum as well as introduced innovations for teaching the course. Her efforts did not go unrecognized though for she won one award after the other, and eventually got the Intel Excellence in Teaching Award.  Her experience proved her long-time belief that Filipinos can compete globally given the proper training, support, and exposure. With her victory, Dr. Biyo has brought world attention that in the Philippines, we have world-class schools with world-class teachers and students; that Filipinos can be world-class if they choose to be; that being world class is passion and commitment to our professions; and that if we do our best, we can conquer the world, and we can have many planets named in our honor.
