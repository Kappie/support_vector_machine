Ten minutes later and the top of my head feels tingly and light and I can hear blood speeding through my body, all the way to my fingertips. I haven't had caffeine in years so I hope it will feel like crack very soon. I'm tired and sleepy because I forced myself to walk up the stairs instead of taking the elevator. I made it to floor 8 out of 17. With my big-heeled patent leather mary janes, it felt like climbing the everest. I was supposed to go to the gym this morning and work out properly like I said I would, but there was a naked boy in my bed and I couldn't get up until 5 minutes before my bus was scheduled to depart. So instead I went up the stairs twice and figured it equivalent to 20 minutes on the dreaded stair-master..  Over lunch my fellow downtown corporate whore homo friend Dirk and I compared our relationships. His long-distance boyfriend plays passive-aggressive mind games over the phone. My pseudo-sweetheart communicates too well about things that offend me "Yes, the last girlfriend didn't do much for me. It was a fetish thing." Dirk's Jake is obsessed with pop music to the point of absurdity. M is obsessed with oversimplifying people. And porn. We agreed that we have to accept these drawbacks for the positive attributes of our (in)significant others. Or good sex.. I told Dirk that all of my troubles would be solved if M was a deaf-mute. Maybe we can reach some sort of a compromise. Iâ€™ll grow my hair long if he stops talking.
