       
      New job started today.  Not a good first day, just feeling very overwhelmed.  I moved over the weekend and have no internet access for about a week.  Things are just basically biting right now.  I can check my email at Julie's but between Saturday night and tonight, over 800 emails came in.  Will be back on when I get back up at home, until then no emails please.    Thanks!
