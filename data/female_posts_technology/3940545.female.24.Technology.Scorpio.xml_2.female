Because I was too foolish to look beyond friendship and didn't open my mouth and tell him how I felt. But shouldn't you start off as friends first and it'll progress into something beautiful and worthwhile? So why was I too afraid to speak my mind? Should I fight my feelings? Or should I just go ahead and tell him how I feel? Even though he is now in a "committed" relationship. Why should I care about his significant other? Maybe its not meant for me to be with him. Hey did he see beyond our friendship and tell me how he felt? Did he pursue me? Why didn't he tell me he was seeing someone else? Why did it take me to ask him? Would he have ever told me if I didn't ask? Why wasn't I aware? But yet you're in love? It takes time to fall in love. You have to have a relationship. So where do I fit in? Was I just a friend and nothing more? Were we dating? I guess not. Guess I was wrong. Did she know about me? Why am I finding out now? So when we went out what was that? When we went to the lounge and had a drink and later chilled at ur house and watched a movie? Do u remember? When u had your arm around me that night? Was that just an excuse to get you out of the house for some fun while she was busy? Maybe they will last. Maybe they won't. Well time to move on.
