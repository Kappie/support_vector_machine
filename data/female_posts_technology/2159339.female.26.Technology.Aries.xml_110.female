It was decided on last night, after I took a hot shower and realized that there's no way in hell I'm getting dressed just to move the truck. The streets are cleaned from 6 to 7 am on Mondays in my neighborhood, so the plan was to get the truck (my brother's, we switch sometimes) at 6 and go to the beach with a cup of tea and the book I'm trying to finish, come back at 7, eat, go to work. But then I had this insane dream last night (about high school and Scooter and my first grade teacher in the motherland), so instead I reparked the truck in a 2 hour zone and went back to sleep to see how the dream ends, then moved it again at 7 to its spot for the day.   This weekend was quiet and restful and lovely. The house was full of people and tasty food smells and music and movies. I finally picked up the rest of my crap from the page street house, dropped off my dry cleaning, and sewed half of the slipcover for the couch. I saw two movies, ate too many ice cream mochis to count, had brunch with Batty, JJ Fadd and TJ Maxx and circled the airport 7 times waiting for my friend to land.  And I didn't have to tnink about work for a second.
