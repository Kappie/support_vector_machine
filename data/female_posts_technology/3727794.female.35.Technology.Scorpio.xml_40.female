The one I used today said "You're not bitter, you're cynically hopeful." Another fave of mine is "You're not alone. I don't like your boyfriend either."   urlLink http://www.areyoumyboyfriend.com/SimplySheProducts.html   Why can't I come up with crap like this?  I've got the bad attitude, the over-abundance of sassiness, a little creativity (ok a lot more with some chocolate martini's, but still).  Yup, I'm gonna have a drink/creative session with Russell and we're coming up with our own line of journals, note cards and the like.  Something with a combo of his old-fashioned barbie style and my attitude...could be good.  If not, at least we'll have good drinks.
