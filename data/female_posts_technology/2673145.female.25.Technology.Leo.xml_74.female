I was surprised and thot it was some prankster but soon recognised that voice. It's always great to just listen to him.   My flu got worst. The sinus is so blocked that my tooth aches. The body is fighting very hard against the virus, cos I'm feeling feverish. So I went to the doc's after 5 days since the first visit and get a strong dosage of the meds. I hope it clears my sinus as it's really irritating not being able to breath well, eat well, sleep well. I just took the meds, and I'm very drowsy now but the sinus is still blocked and hurting!! Oh well, just hope I'll get better over the wkend or else I'll have to go the doc's again to get certified to be excused from work.   Time to let the body recuperate.. zzzzz
