Welcome to the mission journal of the little group we like to call Dante's Demons. We have an official government issued classification, of course, but I can't share it with you. Top secret, you understand. This was Symone's idea but, of course, she is too busy to come up with a good way to begin this. So, it falls to me to come up with something spectacular. Being the youngest, and the only human, sucks ass.  You see, the three of us: Symone, Ireth and I, are creating this in order to inform the people, of this country and of the world, about their danger. Not the danger of terrorism, or of weapons of mass destruction. Not the danger of murderers, rapists, or politicians. There is another danger out there for the mere mortal. They're called the Lost Ones, renegades, revenants… killers. There are secrets within secrets in the world; and we’re going to introduce you to a few of them. Sit back and let me explain to you how the world really is.  There’s mythology behind this, but they’re not my beliefs, so I’m not going to waste my time with them. I’ll just give you a glimpse of how it really is. The truth is, we are not alone. We have never been alone. And all the horrors of your nightmares cannot compare to the reality of the situation. You see, vampires are real. Werewolves? Well, they’re not just wolves. Shape shifters. The stuff of midnight sweats, where you pull the covers up to your chin and peer desperately into the darkness wondering what’s out there, and if it will come to claim you. Sometimes, it does.  Now, not everything is as Bram Stoker claimed it was. The mind explains where it doesn’t have an answer. And so, some things are very different. You see, the vamps have always been predators. They have a lust for blood that nothing else on earth can come close to. it’s a deficiency in their cells that does it, or so I’ve been told. Symone is the scientist, and she’s told me so. I can’t tell you exactly how it works, because I don’t know. What I do know, is that they can control it. A vampire can live a very long time drinking the blood of warm-blooded animals. It seems they don’t like to drink cold blood; they can’t stand sinking their teeth into a lizard or such. But, throughout the centuries, we’ve become sort of a delicacy to them. They love us the way I love a sirloin steak. I can go without the steak if I want to, choose something else. Most of the vamps existing in the world today go without their sirloins, or at least find a willing “donor” that won’t give them away. The vamps are ruled by their own congress, which exists solely to interact with the governments of the world and keep their secrets hidden. This congress is the vampire law. Unfortunately for the vamps, though, they don’t get due process. If they break their laws, they just get dead.  Other things from the stories that aren’t true about vamps? They can go out in daylight. Sunshine weakens them a bit, they can’t do a lot of their tricks. The strangeness in their blood makes them just allergic enough to sunlight to prevent them from causing too much mischief. That, and eating in the daylight is a good way for a vamp to sign his own death warrant. They’re also not afraid of crosses, although most of them have only contempt for the religion of humans. However, a lot of them are allergic to silver. Oh, and vamps don’t turn into bats or anything else.  Which brings us to the next order of business: shape shifters. The shifters are the traditional enemies of the revenant vampires. Depending on who you ask the story varies from them working for the vampires, in effect being their hired guns, to them being the natural enemies of all vamps, having been put here to control their population and protect humankind. The shifters come in many varieties. There are wolves, of course. There are also: large cats, wyverns, hyenas and bears. These five tribes have their own ruling body, which has existed nearly as long as the vampire congress, and also interacts with the humans in power.  Worried yet? Because this is real, chicks and dudes. Real life nightmares come to life. Kind of makes your hair stand on end, doesn’t it? Well, for those of you who aren’t yet ready to either run screaming or shrug your shoulders and call our story a fake; good for you. Tune in next time, kiddies, for another dose of reality.
