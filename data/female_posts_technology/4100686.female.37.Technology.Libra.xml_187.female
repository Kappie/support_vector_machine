Oh well, i am  urlLink linking  it anyway, just in case it reappears.    urlLink Kurdish Media;  a very comprehensive site, all sorts here, from  urlLink Art  Culture  to  urlLink News in Kurdish,  even  urlLink forums  and a list of  urlLink political parties.   This made me curious; a  urlLink Kurdistan Satellite Channel  (also  urlLink here ) which i found connected to the site of the  urlLink Kurdistan Democratic Party.  Whether the two are connected in more ways then this i do not know.   What strikes me most in  urlLink googling  the Kurdisphere is the level of political activity, which seems to be diverse and energetic.
