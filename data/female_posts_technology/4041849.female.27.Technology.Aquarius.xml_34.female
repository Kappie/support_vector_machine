Jackass. anyway,Jackass is a frickin' stalker. he doesn't know when to leave people alone and he doesn't know when they're annoyed by him. i can't even make eye contact when he comes to talk to me, even if it's about work because he's so damned annoying...        he's right in front of my cubicle right now. i'm not listening to a word he's saying. i'm just saying, "uh-huh, uh-huh," and looking at my screen as i'm typing... and he's still talking. even if it's about work, it's completely and totally useless.        wtf does he want? everyone hates him. when will he realize this? good lord, go away... yes, yes. you have a good evening, too, Jackass. phew! finally. sheesh.        jackass.
