This time it is not for an internship opportunity but for a nanny position through a company that works for Ford.  In late January I left a nanny job with a family that  I worked for since last June, but because it clashed with my winter schedule I had to quit.  I watched as a 4 month old baby girl go from rolling over, to scooting, to crawling, and eventually to walking....and boy does it happen fast.  I also cared for her older brother who was 4 and very loving and kind.  I got very attached to them,  especially the baby girl who was so incredibly smart.  From 7:30 AM till 5:00 PM, 5 days a week I cared for her, played with her, sang and danced with her, and taught word/language associations to her.  Her first word was baby..and that was from me pointing to her picture everday saying it again and again.  Eventually I stopped and she picked it up from there.  After that..everytime she saw her picture on the ledge next to her high chair she would point with her tiny delicate finger saying "baby!" big baby smile across her face. I loved it!  In fact,  I found it fascinating to watch how quickly she was learning.  The amount of information a child learns at that age on into early childhood is amazing to me. Anyway.  I went through withdrawal after I left the job...feeling guilty etc.  But I know I helped shape who she is and who she will become no matter how insignificant it might seem.  No energy goes unwasted...especially love and nurturing.    So getting back to my interview tomorrow. I am hoping it will be a lot better than the phone interview I had the other day.  I feel a lot more confident since I have a lot of experience with children.  I need a job bad right now...and it is the best option for me momentarily.  Let me tell you a little bit about my past work experience.  At 18, I started working at Rouge Steel in Dearborn Michigan.Which is super funny to some,  because I am 5'3 and weigh 115 pounds.  More like 100 at the time I worked there though.  So picture a small girl wearing a hard hat bigger than her head, steel toe shoes with metatarsals, and green overalls with my name on them.  Ha ha  I worked at the factory for three years.  There I went from cleaning, to banding coils of steel, to inspecting them for defects, to driving hi-los, and even operating  overhead cranes(it was like a videogame up there).  Honestly,  despite the dirty work conditions(Rouge is Henry Ford days old) and God knows what floating around in the air besides graphite, etc......I liked working there.  Working there were some of the most interesting and intelligent people.  Some even had college degrees and decided they liked that work better than whatever it was they went to school for.  It was amazing witnessing the comraderie and brotherhood amongst the workers. I fit right in..I joked and bullshited with the best of them.    I even learned how to play tonk...a card game. But I didn't do it for money like some of the guys did.   I began daydreaming about making a documentary about working there...but never got the bravery to sneak in a video camera. The one thing I regret .  I did take pictures of people and some of the machinery..but very few.  I read the book "Rivethead" by Ben Hamper while working there and got some inspiration to do something....but like I said, I never did....only passing the book along to others to read....and never getting it back.  Which reminds me....I forgot to add that book to my favs list in my profile.  Ohh well.. You should check it out if you ever get the chance.  Michael Moore is the one who sort of gave him a chance writing and if you read the book you will see why.  Good bluecollar stuff.  Its the reality of factory life and you can even get a taste of what I experienced though his eyes.  Very similar to every factory workers life.     To shorten my work experience let me just list them.....after Rouge.....I was a store manager at the mall, a security officer at General Motors, a data entry specialist at a mortgage company(by far...the most tedious and lame), and finally...a nanny.  Where I get the most satisfaction and joy.   Ok...I gotta end this....I hear a weird noise and am scared a tornado could be coming. Its storming out and ohh my God.  So scared.     Later-
