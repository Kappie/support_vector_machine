Top 10 Actors I enjoy seeing in the cast list of a movie:   Most of these are 'character' actors. Jeez, that is such a denigrating term. Anyway, they are always fun to watch:   10   urlLink J.T. Walsh  R.I.P., J.T. I always got a kick out of his performances. He always seemed to play bad guys and he never got  too  hammy. Just hammy enough. If you go through his filmography you will be stunned by how many of his movies you have seen.   9   urlLink Adam Baldwin  Not one of the Baldwin brothers. Remember  My Bodyguard ? How about  Full Metal Jacket ? He had small reoccuring roles on both  The X-Files  and  Angel . Good looking; he tends to play tough guys/heavies. Brings a good amount of intensity to his roles, like Clancy Brown only not as creepy (see the other list).   8   urlLink Philip Seymour Hoffman  Often confused with Jack Black, except he's not a patented asshole. I first saw him in  Twister ; he seems to be a favorite of Paul Thomas Anderson ( Boogie Nights  and  Magnolia ).   7   urlLink Brian Cox  Gained my attention as the first Hannibal Lector (in  Manhunter ). He was elegant and menacing in a psycho way without the ham. I saw him last as Melaneus in  Troy .    6   urlLink Chris Cooper  He first came to my attention in  American Beauty , he won me over in  Lone Star  because the love story in that movie involved a middle-aged couple.    5   urlLink Scott Glenn  He plays tough guys. Kind of a poor man's Lee Marvin. Again, plenty of intensity without the ham (mostly). I first noticed him in  The Right Stuff  I think. It might have been something sooner than that. Often confused with Fred Ward, who is often confused with Robert Forster.   4   urlLink Ewan Bremner  Scot. Shows up in movies with Ewan MacGregor a lot. He's not handsome, but he is nowhere near as phugly as his IMDb picture makes him. Holy crap, dude! Who did you piss off to get that picture posted? Or were you cast to play Tim Burton in a movie?!!? Anyway, first noticed in  Trainspotting .   3   urlLink Lance Henriksen  Everybody knows who Lance Henriksen is. I have seen him in a gazillion things; first came to my attention as Bishop in  Aliens .   2   urlLink Tom Sizemore  I hate the fact that he seems to want to self-destruct. Dude. Quit threatening your ex-girlfriends! I can't remember which movie I first saw him in but he's been all over the map. Tends to play heavies or wisecracking soldiers.   1   urlLink William Fichtner  Intensity without getting hammy. See a common thread here? First came to my attention in  Equilibrium  although I have seen him in dozens of other movies before.    Top 10 movie creeps:   At one point in their career, these guys have played some sort of creep and it got them typecast. At least, when they're in the cast list, I get uneasy. Totally unfair, because some if not all of these guys do an exemplary job in whatever they do.    10   urlLink Xander Berkely  Played George Mason in  24 . I have always considered him a creep or a jerk. Can't recall which movie did it, though.   9   urlLink Tom Berenger  It is so totally unfair that I put him on this list. But I saw  Looking for Mister Goodbar . Matter of fact, I double-dog dare you to rent it and watch it back-to-back with  Rustler's Rhapsody . Your brain *will* implode.   8   urlLink Liev Schreiber  He played such a wierdo in  Phantoms  I have never been able to watch him in anything else without getting creeped out. That movie is a guilty pleasure, by the way.   7   urlLink Dylan Baker  I've mentioned him before. He was in  Happiness . I can't watch him in anything else without remembering the scene --- eewww, never mind.    6   urlLink William H. Macy  He plays ordinairy joes so well, but I have  Fargo  stuck in my head. Oh, you betcha.    5   urlLink Michael Wincott  Plays heavies a lot; has a low raspy voice. So why is Michael Wincott on this list and Lance Henriksen on the other list? Henriksen is  intense . Michael Wincott is  creepy .   4   urlLink Ted Levine  Buffalo Bill in  Silence of the Lambs . Need I say more?   3   urlLink Clancy Brown  The Kurgan in  Highlander . Oh, this is funny! He has an active career as cartoon voices including  Spongebob Squarepants .    2   urlLink Steve Buscemi  Everything he's ever done! Now that I think of it, Peter Stormare should be on this list, too. Between him, Buschemi, and William H. Macy, was there ever a wierder collection of creeps?   1  urlLink Vincent D'Onofrio  Private Pyle in  Full Metal Jacket . I remember seeing  Adventures in Babysitting  where he wasn't so fat or brain-damaged and still being somewhat creeped out. He never fails to make me uncomfortable.
