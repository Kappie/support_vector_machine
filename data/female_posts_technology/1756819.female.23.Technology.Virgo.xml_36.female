You can get all kinds of strange and wondrous things there.  Grocery shopping got me to thinking.  As I spend more and more time here, in a larger city, I wonder how it would be if I were to move back into the country.  At home I could never find some of the things that we bought last night without going all the way to Toronto.  I would also miss the bookstores and malls here.  For any decent shopping at home you have to drive at least 45 minutes.  On the flipside, when I'm here I miss the quiet of the country, knowing who lives down your street.  I miss being able to look up and see the stars, its way too bright at night here.  I miss the space and the trees and the animals, at times I feel that there are far too many people and cars and buildings around.  When I go home to visit I thoroughly enjoy myself.  But at the same time, I can't wait to get back.  I feel torn between the two.  I guess I just to find a place that has the best of both worlds.  Or perhaps I'm just experiencing the grass is always greener syndrome.
