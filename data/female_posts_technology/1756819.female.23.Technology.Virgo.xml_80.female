But I've found that the various poses are good for strength and exercising muscles that I don't use very often.  We've been twice now and my muscles are speaking to me :)  I'm not sure I like what they're saying, but on the flip side it feels pretty good too.  I'm amazed at what some of the other women can do.  I find the crocodile pose particularly difficult, I can't quite manage it yet.  All in good time I guess.
