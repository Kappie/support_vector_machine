Now I find out that due to his new job (he's an agency employee so doesn't have much say so in his job) we might have to cancel the trip. Granted we've only paid for airfare, but we got such a wonderful deal I'd hate to see it go to waste. It's supposed to be our 1 year anniversary trip and dreaming of driving along the coast has been getting me through some of the tougher days at work.  I know it's not his fault, but I'm am just so disappointed, I just can't believe that work could get in the way of a planned trip. I guess I take for granted working someplace where vacations and personal time are respected. I should feel lucky for that, but all I can feel right now is disappointment.
