There is no such thing as clean dirt. We don't like it when it blows around but we worry about it when it blows away. There is so much of it and yet we have to buy it.   What fun would children have without dirt. It seems like the dirtier they get, the more fun they are having. The bigger the dirt pile, the further their imaginations can go. It doesn't take anything special to play in dirt. A stick, an old container or just your hands and feet.   We can't live with it and we can't live without it.
