I was telling her about this other blog I had a year ago, which only one other person knew about. I told her I never really felt like sharing it with the world like this one because all it contained was stuff about my Mom when she died. I was telling her that I preferred to start over instead of building from that one. Then I suddenly remembered, tomorrow will be my Mom's 1st death anniversary which I almost forgot. Suddenly made me feel a little sad to realize she isn't around anymore, but wherever she is I know she is happy. I think she is happy too that I got a chance to start my life all over again in a different country. I left Manila about 2 1/2 months after she died but I already made my decision to leave less than a week after her cremation. So I guess this blog is a way for me to say that I have recovered and somehow moved on with my life.     Letter to My Mom    I love you Mommy. Don't worry about me because I'm okay. I think you taught me enough which is why I am able to survive on my own. Sorry I still haven't had enough luck to find myself a decent guy to hang out with. Although, I think you should still be happy for me because I am living my life almost exactly the way I want to. Imagine if I ended up with that guy you liked, I would probably be 200 pounds now, with no career and with 2-3 ugly children running around the house. I always thank God for giving me a mother who always encouraged me to find value in my own achievements and to live my life acccording to my principles. Just keep having fun wherever you are, you deserve it.
