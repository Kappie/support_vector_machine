That's approximately 171 - 172lbs. so I really didn't lose all that much. I'm still as fat as I was months ago.   Do you know that I am closer to 200 lbs. than I am to 100 lbs.? Most women are 105 - 120 lbs. and here I am coming in at 50 lbs over that. If I gain another 30lbs. I'll be over 200lbs! Depressive to think isn't it?  I have a waist that is 34", seriously. My hips used to be only 2" more that when I was thinner, heh .. so horrible to think about. It's where my belly button is, but my natural waist is only 32" - 33", so I have that curvy hourglass look still. Although I want to be able to say .. my waist is 28", and not have to put a clause there and say .. oh yeah, but only at my natural waist (the smallest point of your torso). One does not wear pants there, and if it goes by where you wear your hip huggers then I think my 'waist' would be 42". That's how big my hips are.  Something has to be done. I've been on a drastic kinda diet for the past few days, but have not been able to cut out the junk totally (in moderation) .. but I am proud of my ability to eat small meals. Today I'm going cold turkey, I hope .. just a liquid diet. Or replace most meals  snacks with protein shakes. And working out. I've read that most Hollywood moms lose about 50 - 75lbs in 2 - 3 months, by working out up to 3 hours a day (2 hours cardio, 1 hour weights) and eating next to nothing. So it's not impossible. I'm going for 1 hour cardio today and all this week, then stepping it up the next week.   I'll swim a lot during my vacation and see whether I've still 'got it'. I don't even think I can do 1,000m .. much less 10,000+ that I used to do. But if I do, and since I will have swimsuits I'll go swim as much as I can after the trip. I loved it, and like travelling .. miss it horribly.
