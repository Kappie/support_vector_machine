Seven on an island that end up stranded with mentioning of appendicitus set off huge problems with state troopers sending a rescue squad and three lost their lives. I found this essay to be confusing. I had to read ittwice. I did like it. After figuring out E.B. White uses a tell-tale,this helped put these images in my mind and I find this can't be possible for all this to happen. The pruitts died from drinking carbolic acid that was left behind by the surgeon whic Pa Pruitt had mistaken for alcohol. The oldest boy charles returns giving his family decent burial and returns to the mainland. I find E.B. white uses imagination in the essay and as I am reading this, I find my emotions going in all sorts of directions. One minute, I'm shocked and another I am chuckling because of the detailed work with so many bizarre incidents. The reader is keeping my attention in the story with different events going on. I found the essay powerful, sad, and hilarious. A Hard-to-Believe Story.
