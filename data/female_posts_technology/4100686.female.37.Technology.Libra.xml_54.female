Have added this blog to  a new section here called  Humanitarian Iraq Blogs , am trying to think of a better name for this section but that will do for now.   Notes;  1. New links and sections are added to the bottom in the sidebar, this way it is possible to view links chronologically without having to read through all the archives to find out when they were added. I am observing that this method seems to be reflecting a progression of events as they unfold.  2. The reference links have been divided into two sections now;  Reference  and  Online Culture , to make things easier to read.
