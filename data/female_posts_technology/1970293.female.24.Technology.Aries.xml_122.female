She laid on her bed with her legs curled up and her head laying on top of her hands. She didn't know how long she laid in that manner but she knew the sun had come up and gone down already. She didn't really care anymore though. Why should she. At least that is how she felt at the moment. Nothing could budge her from her bed not even to eat or take a shower. Now going to the bathroom was another matter. She couldn't just do in her bed. Gross. Life does eventually go on or at least that is what everyone says possibly just to be in denial.She sighed.  She sat up and walked into the kitchen. She grabbed a bagel and some milk. Life does go on eventually even after a breakup of five years.
