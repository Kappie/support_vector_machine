So, I've tried on this dress, but it is $600, so I'm not going to get it.  "Well, it's a discontinued dress, so I guess we could discount it to $300 just for tonight."  I'm still not going to spend $300 without thinking about it, so I get back into my street clothes.  "We can get it down to $200, but the offer goes away when you leave." Hey, I came here straight from work and am not spending $200 on an empty stomach! "Well, if you need to sleep on it, we can extend the offer until tomorrow, but that's it."  They really wanted me to give them the $50 deposit before leaving the store. I might have done it if I could have gotten it back, but if I didn't buy a dress there the only thing I could have done with the $50 would be to buy something else at that store. I really can't justify spending my money on overpriced accessories.  I did like the dress and might have been willing to spend $200 on it, but not if I have to decide that fast. Somehow I think the odds of that exact dress being snatched up in the next week or so are pretty low, but that's the chance I take. I wonder if I could get them to give me the same bargain later?
