I always feel that I will be able to find a carpark close to where I actually want to go, but it seems I never do. It's this eternal optimism about parking that's costing me a fortune in petrol, I'm sure.  In the end I always end up parking quite a way from where I want to go and actually the walk does me a world of good.  But you never know when that person with the great park is going to leave, do you?   Also, I feel guilty about buying the quantity of nuts they don't have a price for.  At the place where I buy nuts they have prices for 100g, 250g, 500g and 1kg.  I always buy my nuts in 200g lots.  I don't know why.  The nut lady never seems to mind, though.  It's weird, I'm thinking I could always eat another 50g of nuts, couldn't I? They'd never go to waste.  That's about the extent of it today - yep, nuts and parking.
