I started off with a big breakfast; bacon, eggs, toast, and orange juice. I started reading one of my new magazines,  urlLink LiP . It's thier premier issue and it looks really promising. The first and only article I got through before  urlLink Phil  decided my magazine was a good place for a nap was an article about preserving water from privatization. One of the names mentioned in the article was Dr. Vandana Shiva, who I recognized from the documentary series "The Corporation". I'm very intriqued by her and want to learn more about her; maybe I'm looking for a new role model.    I got to meet some terrific new people in the afternoon, and had a yummy dinner at Rye's. Following that I worked up quite a sweat at softball practice, and I've just returned from the Sunday movie downtown. This evenings' movie was "High Noon", a western. The sheriff was a mans' man and the ladies wore bonnets. It didn't have a happy ending per se, just an ending. I can't wait for next week, because they're playing a film with Audrey Hepburn!
