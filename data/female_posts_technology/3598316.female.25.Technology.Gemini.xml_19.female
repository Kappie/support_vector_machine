Yes Don, computer is back up and running......your fired.   I am currently trying to convince a guy I work with that declawing his cat is WRONG, but he thinks amputating the cats toes is ok.  I wonder if I amputated something functional of his if he would think the same thing?   On my vacation I discovered I love processed swiss knight cheese. I also discovered that if I want to eat it I need to work out again, so I am going to the gym again. BUt it might be fun to eat the cheese and see what happens if I don't work out? I also discovered that even with spf15 on I will burn like a mother effer.   whateva  great thanks
