Yes, watching the oc last night was, indeed, like one hour orgasm. No man has ever done that for me...or even come close..pun intended. And I can't believe I ate 4 pieces of chocolate. That's more than I have eaten in the past 6 months.  And speaking of candy, my boss sent everyone in my department a bag of halloween candy, so i've been on a sugar high all day. my laffy taffy has 'a joke on every wrapper'...this one says (are you ready?) 'what goes up and down but does not move?' "stairs".....that joke was so bad, i think i better eat some 'sour skittles' just so i don't die of job-hatin'.
