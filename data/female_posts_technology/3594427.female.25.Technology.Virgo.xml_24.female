Not all of the songs were played on the movie but there are some that I really like playing over and over again. Almost all of the songs are about loving people you can only love from a distance, living a life that was forced upon you and also about finding yourself. It’s really about stuff a lot of us are undergoing right now. We don’t have superpowers, but who hasn’t known what’s it’s like to be really frustrated because you can never have the one you love? Who doesn’t occasionally feel like just chucking their responsibilities in the wind and just going for the sort of life they really want? If you are going to get the album, I just need to tell you that there are no sappy love songs in there for the fans of sentimental slow songs. It’s really a compilation from the popular rock bands of today.    I spoke to my friend  urlLink Cecil  last night and I promised I would post here the lyrics to one of my favorite songs from the album, so here it is:       Hold On  by JET
