Orr is my old friend. We know each other for like 13 years (since we were in grade 7). We decided to sit and talk at StarBucks Coffee.   At 5.30 PM, we were going to take a bus home but it was raining and traffic was becoming bad. So we went to have dinner at KFC and then went to SF cinema to watch Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban at 6.20 PM.  At 9 PM, it was still raining. We took airbus no. 113 to go home.  It was such a tiring day but happy with my old friend  :P
