But the 15 1/2 years between college graduation and now? Feels like about 5 years. Until I remember all the stuff that has actually happened in between. Countless jobs  co-workers. Countless apartments and room mates. My wedding and kids and more apartments and houses. Still, its just felt like one unusually long semester!
