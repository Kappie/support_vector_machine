I called Muchtar and check if he was coming cause I need to prepare for the chairman from IDA... He as usual... no not coming... so irresponsible... Hence, tech helpdesk is closed for one day! But, of course, I need to return the repaired tablet to the students... so run up and down the whole school... like 'siao cha boh'.. that's why I called my blog as 'siao cha boh'! I lied to Franics Tong about the projector in the conference room.. I told him to come hurriedly as there's a meeting from IDA is coming.. ha.. ha.. Luckily problem solved.. he want to kiss me... aaahhhhh!!! Then, Wee Suan called, the chairman is unable to make it... Yeah!! Happy siah...!!! Then, after that I continue to design Dorothy's AAD programme sheet... Then Bi Zhi, Shan Shan came to TA Office.. Kelvin was there too... Then all laughed and talked and joked.. so happy... like those days in USSS... Then, when the time is up, all left.. I was waiting for Bi Zhi cause she went to look for Peiting... in the band room.. Then Sherman drove pass the school gate, he asked if I was going to Bedok.. I said yes! He sent me to Yvonne's home... for tuition... Thanks Sherman.. you are the best! I like you... Chee Keeng also very good lah! Unlike 'big fat pig'... ok lah, very tired liao! got to go.. bye bye...
