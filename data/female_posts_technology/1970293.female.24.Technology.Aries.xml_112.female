She started to inch her way back toward the entrance of the cave away from this new terror.    "Wait.  I won't hurt you.  You just surprised me that's all.  If you follow me I will take you where you can rest and maybe eat something.  Here let me light my lamp."  That quick there was a flare in the darkness and a lamp brightened up the area.  It was a large cave and the light didn't even light the ceiling or some of the other walls.    She looked at her host.  He was young possibly a few years older than her with short dark brown hair and a few inches taller than her.  "Come,"  He said as he moved off towards the back of the cave with the lamp.  She definitely didn't want to be left in the dark so she hurried after him taking care not to hurt her ankle more.  She still couldn't see very much of the cave but at least she wasn't alone.  Now she hoped that he wasn't a mean sort of person.  She sighed.  How did her life get to be so tangled.  Finally she could see a wall with a large hole that must lead to this place he spoke of to her.  As he moved closer with the light she could see some chairs and a couch.  She could even see a bed and a table.  Who was he to live in such luxury?    "Come in and make yourself at home.  I don't have much but what is mine is yours.  Please sit and I'll get you some water.  Sorry I don't have anything else.  Would you like something to eat?"  He asked as he lit a few other lamps throughout the room.    "Water is fine, thank you.  Yes, I would like something to eat."  She looked around the room slowly.  He must have carved out a living here in this cave for a long time.  Everything had a place and it certainly didn't look crowded.  it was very cozy.  The bed was against the far wall opposite of the door.  The table and chairs sat  right at the door and a kitchen with a fireplace and cupboards laid against the wall with the door.  A couch type object sat across the room from her.  It looked strange with multicolored material covering it.    "Here you are."  He placed a mug filled with water on the table in front of her.  "I'll make something for us to eat.  Why don't you tell me how you ended up in my cave especially since not many people can find it."  She took a long drink before looking into his nice green eyes.  She felt that she could trust him with her deepest secrets and she couldn't say why.  He instilled such trust within her and she felt protected here in this cave.  Strange.  "I am from the village and well I was born with red hair so that makes me a witch, I guess.  Anyways there has been a lot of bad luck running through the village and of course they blamed me and well I ran for it.  They chased me.  I turned my ankle and I had to find a place to hide.  I saw your cave and that's how I ended here."  "Wow.  What an adventure.  You must be very hungry and tired.  How is your ankle?  Would you like me to take a look at it and maybe wrap it tightly so it won't hurt?"  While he listened he started making dinner but looked at her as he made his offer.    "It's throbbing."  She admitted quietly.  "I'll take a look at it after you get something to eat.  So tell me, are you really a witch?"  She looked up quickly to catch a smile.    She smiled in return.  "No I am not a witch.  I have no magical power or else I could heal my ankle myself."  She laughed a little.
