My officemate is beating on some code with a metaphorical sledgehammer. I've been there before.  Occasionally, I'd like to actually work with physical objects instead of just manipulating a virtual world. I think that is part of the reason why I enjoy knitting so much. There I actually can see what I have done, as opposed to looking at an apparently unchanging computer.   Okay, grumbling break is over. Back to work!
