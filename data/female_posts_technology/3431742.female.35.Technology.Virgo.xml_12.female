Today I will probably be doing some work related stuff.  We are trying to figure out how to make the lab (aka my office) more efficient the way it is before we get an imaging tool.  Yeah I know, it doesn't make sense but either way we have to do something before we get the tool cause it can still be awhile before the tool is tuned up.  Dinner didn't happen on Thurs with all the old college buddies but it will happen this coming Thurs.  Still Pizza Man as the destination.  Jen and I hit Pallermo Villa for Dinner Out night.  Love their food.  They made the best ever Fetticini Allfredo that night.  I emailed a few friends the site link.  I haven't talked or emailed many of them in a long time.  It's good to kinda chat and get re-connected with them.  Hit the theatre 3 times this week.  That's outrageous for me anyway.  Monday night was Harry Potter 3, Tues was The Whole 10 Yards, and last night: The Chronicles of Riddick.  I really need to stop having popcorn for dinner. hehe Chronicles wasn't too bad.  A little more story of how Riddick became such a wanted dude would help.  Maybe it was in there but who can tell when someone is always kicking the back of your chair.  Well that's all for me.  Nap is calling.  Oh yeah, the question is:  Isn't the real person the reason you want to get to know someone or is it due to the shape of their body?
