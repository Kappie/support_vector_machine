Slowly but surely making progress on the old SE.  I found out that its/her name is Loraine.  :)  No files on the filesystem have been changed later than 1998, so it's kind of like a time capsule and sort of ghostly to see hints of the previous users' lives.  I think about all the things that have changed since 1998.  *  I graduated high school (class o' 98) *  The rise and fall of the dot com industry *  teeny tiny cell phones everywhere (my nokia from the time is like a brick now) *  looming y2k fears are gone *  broadband everywhere (it was a big deal to have ISDN back then) *  a new president *  teeny tiny laptops *  rise of the SUVs *  lowering of pants' waistbands *  IPO fashionability * the metamorphosis of Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears (remember how they used to be cute?)  Most of these things revolve around developments in the tech field.  I consider myself blessed to have been able to work with and watch some incredible technology rise, become dominant (and sometimes fall).  It doesn't seem like it's been 6 years though...  Amazing how time flies, huh?  -- Aeryth
