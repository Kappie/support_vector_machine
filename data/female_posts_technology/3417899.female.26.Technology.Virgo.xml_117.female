       
      When I was young, I used to play this game: I'd think of a word that I was embarrassed to say, or one that awakened dark memories - and then I'd force myself to say it. Again and again and again and again.  Until the word no longer had any meaning. Until the word's significance, both literal and emotional, was eroded to a mumbled string of sounds with no depth.   If only I could do the same with my memories.
