I understand logically that I haven't really known this individual that long.  It doesn't stand to reason that I would be involved in the intimate circle of this person. But to be not included isn't fun.  Especially when you thought it wasn't going to happen in the first place. I suppose that I will just deal. "Get ovah it", as they say. But it still stings, especially when you thought that you were becoming closer friends with those people. Does that mean I hold back? Does that mean that these people really aren't who I thought that they were? Or is it simply... what I said in the beginning. I suppose that I will eventually find out.
