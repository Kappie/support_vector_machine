There were 4 of us in total, my husband, brother, and a good friend from college.  The group was supposed to be much larger but various illnesses, work issues, and sheer laziness cut the number down to 4.  We arrived in the vicinity of the Dilling Road trail-head ( urlLink Segment A  of the North Country Trail) late Friday afternoon.  After an hour long search for the actual trail-head (note to self, bring more detailed county maps for the next trip) we finally parked the cars and headed off.   Update from a friendly visitor: There's not really a trail head at Dilling Road, it's basically just a point where the trail crosses the road.  Keep an eye out for North Country Trail (NCT) markers on either side of the road.  If you look close, you'll spot them.      We had to hike close to 7 miles that evening to meet up with my brother at the Red Bridge trail-head.  We pushed ourselves hard to get to the second trailhead (and the start of the  urlLink Manistee River Trail ) before nightfall.  We arrived at the road at dusk and hiked in 1/2 mile or so to a suitable campsite.  We ended up setting up camp in the dark and the search for dry firewood began.    Finally we had a small campfire going, our tents pitched, hammock slung, and it was time for dinner.  A steak packed in by my brother provided a hearty meal for my husband.  Only problem is he stole the fire to cook on the coals.  So long campfire.  After dinner and cleaning the dishes I was ready for bed.  I turned in while the boys sat around the fire and drank.  Extra food and necessities were left at home or in the car due to weight, yet 2 fifths of jack somehow made the cut.  I didn't sleep well that night, the $6 foam pad under my sleeping bag didn't offer any protection from the hard ground.  The entire night my hips were digging into the ground.  Next morning after a breakfast of oatmeal and gatoraid we set out.  Our aim was to complete the Manistee River Trail in one day.  Total length of the Trail is 10.5 miles and we figured that would be a doable distance considering we had completed 7 miles the night before in less than 4 hours.  That would leave us with another 10 mile hike Sunday along Segment A of the North Country Trail.  A long hike for the third day, but necessary to return us to the parking lot.  One hour and less than 2 miles into the Manistee River Trail we stopped to reevaluate our goals.  The packs seemed heavier and were rubbing harder than they had the day before.  The terrain was no hillier, but perhaps looming nightfall and the need to meet up with my brother had pushed us on.  We decided to hike another 3 or so miles further on the Manistee River Trail, set up camp and enjoy the day, and then return along the same path the next morning.  This ended up working out perfectly.  Along this stretch of the Manistee River Trail we also got a chance to try out our newly acquired Katadyn water filter.  There were several small bridge covered streams that fed into the Manistee which provided the perfect spot to filter water.     Filtering the water was a lot easier and a lot better tasting than I ever thought it would be.  It certainly helped that we were using a clean and fast moving water source.  In less than 5 minutes we were able to fill 4 Nalgene bottles, a 1 quart storage bottle, and a few miscellaneous canteens.     We hiked two hours or so until we found a suitable campsite.  This time we were right alongside the river instead of on a bluff overlooking it.  We set-up camp and took a refreshing dip in the river (the very cold river).  Clean and exhausted we settled in for what was to be a short nap.  Two hours later we awoke and began preparing for dinner.  We spent a few hours around the fire as the night sky crept in.  It really is amazing the amount of stars you can see outside the city.  The sky was alive with white dots, I think I even saw the Milky Way.  The strange thing was that there was no moon, not that night or the one before.    The next morning we loaded up and headed back the way we came.  We settled on a leisurely pace knowing that we didn't have far to go to get back to the car.  About 20 minutes before we reached the car it began to rain.  It was a light rain and the trees did a good job of catching the majority of the drops.  This was a good thing because putting on rain gear that doesn't breathe in 80 degree weather is not my idea of fun.  We arrived back at the car exhausted and sore.  Although I felt strangely refreshed and alive.  We've promised ourselves that we'll plan another trip soon, maybe this time with a little more planning we can cover more ground.  I definitely want to do more of this backpacking thing.
