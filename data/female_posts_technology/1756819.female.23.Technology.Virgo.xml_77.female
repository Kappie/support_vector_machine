The clinics have had this phantom error that pops up several times a day, but I can never reproduce it.  And end users are oh so helpful..."it won't save" is all I get.  But today, after a conversation with my boss I got a brainwave about how to try to reproduce the problem.  And what do you know...it worked!  Now I can actually fix this problem and get it off my list.
