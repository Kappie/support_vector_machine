I'm getting there with the diet, but I have to add in the exercise.  The weight is creeping up on me though, I'm about 168lbs if I readily admit it .. but sometimes I get on the scale and it reads about 164lbs .. so I'll say about 165 - 168lbs to be safe. I do not want to be 170lbs again. Actually I do not want to be this big anymore. Sometimes I wonder how the hell I could just put on 10lbs and not notice it!   I will work out today. Do something about it. Don't just sit on your a** anymore.
