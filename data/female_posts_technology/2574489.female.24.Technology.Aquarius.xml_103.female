He lost his patience with me at the end of the day Saturday (and that is hard to do!), and I apologized.  That's what I love about hubby, he is so patient! (Thank you, babe...)  I was much better Sunday.  Sunday, we again went to East Buffet...must write up new Bedroom Fortunes soon, I'm stockpiling them.  I swear though, this is the last time I am  going to a buffet since it derails my whole fitness and diet plan.  I have managed to work out 4 times last week.  Yay me!    But back to our Sunday. After the buffet, where we watched the Houston Rockets wipe the floor with the Dallas Mavericks, we went to Sack N' Save and got Aloe Vera for hubby.  Co-workers have been telling him it will help his tummy digest better.  We also bought some Costa Rican bananas (mini bananas).  After that we drove out of our way to the only asian store we know of (and the biggest) around our area.  We had a blast browsing!  I stocked up on junk food.  I bought some Hong Kong Grill-A-Corn spicy flavored chips, some Chinese Fried Green Peas, some Pocky  which are like yan-yan except you don't have to dip it into the chocolate, its already got the chocolate on it.  I also bought some preserved prunes that I had co-workers taste last time.  They spat it out instantly.  I love it msyelf though...hehehe. But what upset me was there was no Chippy! The last two times I've visited there hasn't been any Chippy :(.     Hubby spent all the time we were there picking out tea and tea stuff.  He got a new tea cup, and a YamoMotoYama green tea, and ginseng tea which he spent about 10 mins. choosing. He sure loves his tea.  He now has four different teas at home, not counting the special herbs he uses for his tea from Morocco.  Then we worked out. I brought him as a guest to my gym.  After that, we went home, and watched Memento.  And here's my rant to Netflix:   You were supposed to have sent CSI disk 2 and Le divorce on friday and all we get is Memento and you couldn't even send a DVD that doesn't skip!!!!I was over halfway finished with the movie and it kept skipping and skipping and you made me throw the remote at the TV now send me my DVDs and get it right this time!!!!   End Rant.  So I will have to wait for a replacement copy because it kept skipping. Sigh.  I asked hubby whether I had been "good" on Sunday before we fell asleep in bed.  He said yes, it almost made up for Saturday--that is until, I threw the remote at the TV.
