Rick and I went up to the Heartland in Mississauga to go to the Best Buy... I resisted when he said "Lets go to Baskin Robbins", but then we drove past the Krispy Kreme... and the "HOT" light was one... and then... *sob*  I had not ONE,  not TWO,  but THREE Krispy Kreme donuts!!!  Its not entirely my fault... I only asked for one, but they gave me two "samplers" as well. Sweet, sweet, sugary goodness, it was tasty.  Sad, sad day.
