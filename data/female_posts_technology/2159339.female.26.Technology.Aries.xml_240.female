Tearing and ripping, not clean slicing! Not like Julia and Jacques on the TV!  Sat : I had plans to see the Art Deco exhibit at the Legion of Honor, but my brother called at the last minute and we (and his GF) visited my aunt in the hospital at Stanford. She has cancer. On the way home, we went to Wing Lee bakery on 6th  Clement and got dim sum. I like my brother's GF because even though she's white, she likes to try everything. She got 6 rice balls and I was like I've never had those, what are they like? and she shrugged and giggled, "I've never had them either!" They were pretty good. It's sticky fried rice with bits of pork and green onions shaped into the size of golf balls. Quite tasty! When I got home, I watched half of Planet of the Apes. At night I bought all these cleaning supplies and scrubbed my toilet and tub. I also bought all these books from Green Apple: 3 are sex-related, and 1 is called "Crafty Girl". I can read them all and incorporate my knowledge into one grand project: a dreamcatcher for my cootch.            At night, watched SNL w/ Abby  co. Lamented  urlLink Jimmy Fallon 's hot-hot-hottie departure. SNL, hire more hotties! More stimulating droolifying eye candy! More handsome sluts to read your off-camera cue cards! Jimmy, why??!!!  Sun: had a drink at brunch w/ Abby  co., hung out with J-wo and bought Elton John 70s sunglasses, had 2 mimosas w/ Mr.Hottie on Haight St and got DRUNK, drunkly watched him try on shoes, went home and tried to do some drunk yoga, but collapsed in drunk heap and decided to take nap instead. after nap, met up w/ Abby again and watched a movie at the Women's Building that was part of the documentary festival. went home and fell asleep early.
