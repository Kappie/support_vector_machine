I grew up with five brothers and three sisters and some are alcoholics and some are not.  I may not have turned into an alcoholic but I do remember how tough it was for all of us.  There were a lot of sleepless nights and I remember being very tired for school some days because my dad would come home drunk and wake us all up and finally he'd either pass out or start eating something and then go to bed.  I had a hard time accepting and not understanding much about alcoholism until I went too some Al-Anon meetings and it made me understand to detach from the alcohol, and not the alcoholic.  Words just can't describe how many bottles of whiskey I dumped down the drain and my brothers and sisters did the same thing.  That wasn't the end of it though.  Something worse had to happen before my dad went to seek treatment and that was the part of molesting my niece.  This I have only been able to comprehend in the last couple years because I was a Senior when this happened.  When you think things can't get any worse than the drinking, it can.  Thank goodness it was fondling and no intercourse.  That sounds bad but I'm thankful for that part of it not getting any further than it already had.  My Dad is now a recovering alcoholic but still I find it hard to me to this day to see him and not picture what has been done.  I know it wasn't me and nothing did happen to me.  As for the rest of my family members, I can not say for sure.  It is another sick disease.  My dad is now eighty-three years old and I'm not sure why I am writing of this now but I still love my Dad and Mom even though what has happened is wrong.  I remember my niece saying at the time that she didn't want to get grandpa in any trouble but I guess this is what it took for the drinking to stop.  He had a hard time because he was away in treatment for three and a half years and I wrote him back a letter when I received one from him.  It still really hurts when something like this happens and I think I speak for my dad, my family and myself when I say we still always will suffer great emotional pain from this.  I feel this imperfection helped my dad to seek the help he needed.  The one thing I hate about all of this is why didn't he get help before it had come to that?  I guess I'll never know.  This was very hard for me to write about because in some ways I feel ashamed to be a part in this as family.  All I know is, I never left my girls alone with my Dad even though I love him.  He may have this imperfection and his faults but he has taught me a lot also and in the last couple years, I've actually been able to talk and enjoy being around my dad where as before I would feel somewhat uncomfortable but not anymore.
