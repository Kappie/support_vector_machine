I always kept in mind that things shouldn't be taken for granted because time was not always on your side and chances don't always come in seconds or thirds. Even if some experiences hurt, they shouldn't prevent you from taking more. Like a child playing in a playground, no matter how many times I stumbled and fell, I always got up to try every swing, every slide, every monkey bar, and every course that the playground offered. No matter how high the slide was, I had to climb it-curious of what the rush would be when I slide down. I would scrape my knee and bruise my elbow in the process, but I would ignore the pain and continue to play. It was as if the afternoon was my entire life and there was no time to lose. Things were much simpler as a child playing in a playground compared to the world of an adult. And sometimes I wonder if I was still that person living in the present. Yes, I still did crazy things here and there, but am I doing the things that matter?
