He said that men don't want to make commitments because they're always waiting for the-next-hot-thing to come along. So they don't appreciate what they have.  And they don't know that they can't get the-next-hot-thing anyway.   This is sagely advice and confirmation that XX is a member of this vile specie. The timing was off in our brief romance. I was sandwiched in-between a booze-filled, vice-ridden,  urlLink rockabilly weekend in Vegas  and his  urlLink first adventure to Europe . During our long break-up talk, he kept saying that he wanted "to be free" without stating the specifics. From what I had to infer, he wants to be free to carouse the great continent of Europe and cavort with European women. He has grand allusions that Europe will change his life and broaden his worldview. He probably wants to be free to engage in fleeting affairs and make Euro-notches in his manly belt. Whatevs. I think he's a fool. He's 30 years old and the biggest fool. Because I'm awesome and he's never gonna get anyone as awesome as me again. Anywhere.  And this makes me feel smug too: in the aftermath of a break-up, you can press your friends to state their true opinions and 3 of them commented separately on his social awkwardness. Ha! This makes me feel great! I've actually heard this before but my love-goggles distorted my perception. I thought XX was perfect and wonderful, but now I see what people are talking about: he's flawed and makes people uncomfortable. Ha! I'm awesome and he's not. I kiss myself!
