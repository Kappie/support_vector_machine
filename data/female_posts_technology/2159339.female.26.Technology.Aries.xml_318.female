From my outpost at reception I am watching through the glass window and I can see the first model outside... She is wearing a white tank top and bright blue adidas-type shorts. She is a leathery woman of about 40 years and she is running with THE fashion accessory of mid-summer: a slobbery golden retriever. (5 minutes pass... 5 minutes of dead air, while Batty scans the various parking lots for more models.) Ok! Hi folks, I'm back. Two more models have appeared, a couple... They're dressed alike. Looks like the outfit  de rigeur  these days for a jaunt to the electronic goods store is khaki pants and a plain cotton t-shirt. (10 more minutes pass while no one passes by outside.) Ok! And back to you Anchor Batty!  Anchor Batty (in the studio):  Dude, Onsite Batty, don't ever do this feature ever again. There's a reason Emeryville CA isn't on the fashion map. Just look at the companies around you: Chiron, Siebel Systems, Sybase. You're surrounded by corporate casual!   Onsite Batty: I know, I know. But I think there's potential in Emeryville. I mean, look at the history... indian burial ground, then toxic dump, then breeding ground for corporations, cheap furniture, and national chain bookstores. You figure, what'll be next, right? Right?! And of course, the answer is hotbed of cutting edge fashion! Haute couture!  Anchor Batty: You MORON! Get back to the studio this instant! I'm scheduling a meeting in exactly one hour!  (1 hour passes. Setting: meeting room at twobadapples studio.)  Anchor Batty: I have scheduled this meeting to discuss your future with this corporation. You have made an embarrassment of us with your insipid feature "From the Catwalks of Emeryville CA". I want to touch base with you on that issue and resolve things before they spiral out of control. I would also like to say again "touch base" and add "let me know" and "we'll be in touch" and "thanks in advance." (Anchor batty raps on the table twice quickly to emphasize her point and signal that she's done talking.)  Onsite Batty: What? What the hell are you talking about?  HR Batty: (talking in a soft non-threatening voice) Do you understand what Anchor Batty has expressed, Onsite Batty?  Onsite Batty: No! She's talking in corpo-speak! I have to stop this madness. (Takes off hot pink pointed flat and holds it at Anchor Batty.) Get Thee Back, Corpo-Batty-Satan!   Anchor Batty: No!!! Too fashionable! Too trendy! My eyes! My eyes! Take it away! The shoe! The shoe...(Anchor Batty perishes in a cloud of beige and muted khaki.)   HR Batty: (says calmly in even tone) Well, from the looks of things, the issue has been resolved. Good luck on your continued employment with this company. (She gets up, excuses herself, and leaves the meeting room.)  Onsite Batty: (holds invisible microphone to mouth and announces to no one in particular) Fashion triumphs again! Tune in next week for another episode of "Friday Fashion News, From the Catwalks of Emeryville CA"!!  (Technical Support Batty passes by the open door, and shakes her head in amused pity. She is amused because she thinks Onsite Batty looks like a clown. Onsite Batty looks like a clown because she is only wearing one shoe.)
