With bro, I went to the airport and fetched her.    You cannot underestimate a lady who is on shopping spree. Within a week's stay there, she managed to come back with 4 big luggages when she went with only one luggage...I was horrified when she admitted that she had paid aussie 100 plus for her luggages being overloaded.     We went straight to Swensen to have our dinner after we met up....All the three of us were terribly hungry. Well, you can't really blame us to be gluttionous as we were "trained" at home to eat at 6pm sharp... We had baked rice.... And we managed to look through the shots that she had taken while she was in Brisbane and Gold Coast over the dinner.    After dinner, we headed straight back to her home. The taxi uncle was extremely friendly. Sharon, being a sociable person as well, managed to keep the conversation lively with the taxi uncle throughout the ride.     Her cosy house appealed to bro and I so much that we were reluctant to leave. We decided to stay over as both of us did not have events on in the morning. We talked and sorted out her things that she had brought back.....    I am feeling rather guilt-stricken that I have been receiving a lot of gifts from her these recent months...free treats....free clothes and now, expensive presents...I should be giving something back to her these days or else I will definitely be remorseful of my bad attitude.
