I didn't think that I would make the last two intervals - there are  a lot  of hills in my neighbourhood.  And my mouth was very sore from some dental work I had done yesterday, so I was distracted.    No injuries to report.  Hardly any soreness either.  My calves and shins hurt last week, but they've gotten better this week.  I just keep thinking of how great it is to run 20 minutes or more without stopping.    I really like running Monday-Wednesday-Friday, so I'm going to try running tomorrow morning so don't end up Sunday-Tuesday-Thursday next week.  My plan was to go to High Park and run on the weekends, but they found a dead man there today, so I'm going to hold off on that for a bit.  They found him at 7:30 this morning in the northeast corner of the park.  I live near the east side, so I'm a  little  nervous.    Week 3 is run 90s, walk 90s, run 3min, walk 3min for 20min.
