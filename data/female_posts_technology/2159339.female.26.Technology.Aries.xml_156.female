Thinking of cancelling kayaking (M pissed me off this morning, will have to have another talk tonight) and hanging out with the famfam and Oscar, who will be affected most of all. Besides, Captain Bloodsnatch is coming to town in a few days and bloody camping is not fun.  Beyond tired this morning. Went out last night to celebrate JJ Fadd's lady's birthday at Bruno's with the usual suspects. Oh, how wonderful it was to have all my favorite ladies and fellas at the same place at the same time (tougher than you might think), each dressed up in a fancy dress/dapper suit. How lovely to  enjoy their company in the most relaxed, slightly drunken state. This is what I will remember when I'm a wrinkled 70-year-old hag chain smoking at a cafe in Paris..   Skipping lab tonight so I can nap before the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.
