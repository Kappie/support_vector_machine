I do not follow sports of any kind, certainly not hockey. And I am not the type to get caught up in the emotions of the game - I don't relate to it. I've never been on a team (unless you cound "the band" in high school).  And yet, this film, on a late night flight back home has got me emotional.   (Strange, how I am always emotional on dark, long flights...)   Emotion:   I was jealous of the camaraderie in that hockey team. That one for all and all for one bond. I've don't think I've ever experienced anything like that - except maybe with my family - but that is different. I'd like to know what that feels like.   Emotion:   I want to win something. I need to win something. An achievement to propel me and invigorate me. A trophy of some sort - not necessarily materialistic - to prove something to the world and to myself. I need a win.   Emotion:   "Great moments come from great opportunity".  I am surrounded my them. Opportunities that is. How do I make great moments out of them?
