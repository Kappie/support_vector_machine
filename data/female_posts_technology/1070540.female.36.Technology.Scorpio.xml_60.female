That was fun.  It has been a long time since we did that. But this time he really hurt me.  He slammed me down so hard that when he hit the back of my head I had an instant headache.  I tried to blow it off but it really hurts.    Today he hurt my feelings when he said I was not a real engineer.  I know I am not.  I have not had a chance to put my stuff to work but that really hurt my feelings.  Made me feel like Iwasnt worth shit.  Which is the way I feel at times.   oh well.. Iknow he was just teasing.
