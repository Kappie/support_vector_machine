I watched the 90-minute premiere so I could find out who the contestants are and I wasn’t disappointed with the show! It’s still one of the coolest concepts they ever developed for reality TV. Imagine running around all over the world on an adventure with the one person whom you consider to be your closest friend/closest relative. The potential for genuine human drama is always there. Plus, they really open to the viewers all the possibilities of world travel. I like how given the fast-pace of the program and the short time they have, the producers still manage to show the local flavor of each country they visit.  I haven’t decided yet which team I am going to root for. No character has caught my attention yet. I do know though who I won’t be cheering for: Brandon and Nicole, the models who keep on trumpeting that they are Christians. Maybe I’ve always been uncomfortable with people who keep saying they will put all their trust in the Lord to win the race. It’s not that I am an atheist. There’s just a difference in the way I perceive my relationship with my faith.  At heart, I'll forever be a "Lonely Planet" traveller type. I don't see myself going on a guided tour or a luxury cruise. I'd rather go to a place for at least a week, stay in a cheap (but decent) hotel, search for good bargains and absorb the local culture.
