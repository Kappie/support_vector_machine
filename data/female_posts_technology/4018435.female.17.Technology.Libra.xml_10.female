Melissa is our new ASM and she's hilarious. Damn she's funyn as hell and she make work fun.  After work, Mike picked me up and we talked. Earlier today he wasn't doing so well at all. I sent him a giant email explaining to him that I will always be there for him, friend or more, and he can always come to me to talk. I also told him that if he loved me as much as he claims, he'll come back to me someday after he's sorted out his problems. He's pissed off at his brother for being a big mouth and not respecting his privacy, he's pissed of at AJ for being a jerk and thinking he's going to be his friend again and he's been angry with his parents. Thank god...he's finally angry at them. He's finally angry at the right people.  I think I need to go to bed. I'm going to pass out...I'm really tired.  I'm working tomorrow. Hopefully I'll hear from josh when he gets back from NY. Shawn's back and I'm happy as hell. I can't wait to see him! I love you Shawny! Meggos's back too! I love you Meggo! Yey! Everyone's back (cept heather). I let mike borrow ogre battle for the night.  I'm picking it up from him tomorrow. I gave him his neckalce back that he left here a while back and i put the bracelet i bought him on his wrist again. He wore that hat i bought him today. The one where I sewed his name on the inside. I really do care for him still. I don't think anyone knows him like i do.  He's planning on moving out from his parents house once and for all and getting a job elsewhere so his homelife and work life to clash. Also, while he's on his own, hopefully his parents will have a better appreciation for him when he's on his own. I told him I'd help him search for a place and a job next week if he needs me to.  Well I should go to bed and put sumthing in my stomache since I'm starving. Night Night All!   Carpe Diem...  -The Lonewolf
