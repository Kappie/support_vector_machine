The water was frigid so we just stayed on the sand soaking in the sun.  Spent my time reading reading and working on my tan (har har, like that will work).  My 'tan' is just my skin getting a bit more pink.  After it got cold, we walked along the pier past all the people fishing and walking their dogs.  Now I can actually say that I've been to Lake Michigan :)
