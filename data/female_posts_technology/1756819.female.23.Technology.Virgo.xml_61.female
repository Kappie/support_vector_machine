But DC is right, the house will seem very quiet.  I like having lots of people around.  And I like playing the part of the hostess, feeding people, arranging beds, etc, etc.  It felt as though no one had left, like we all lived in Grand Rapids again.  Its sad that everyone lives so far apart...  By the way, the reviews are in, and Thanksgiving dinner was a success.  Though we were a little behind schedule...but good things come to those who wait, right?
