See, my neice was in town, so I was busy for 5 days, and then I had a lot of catching up to do at work, so...ok, no more excuses.  I am here!  Today sucked. No, this morning sucked. The day has been ok.  So, here is what happened.  A couple of days ago I took my puppy, Zelda, to get spayed.  Poor baby...  Anyway, it was a single day thing, and I picked her up later that night.  She was fine all night, all lovey and stuff.  The next morning she awoke with such a fury and energy about her, I couldnt control her!  She has been like this since.  I thought it was because i have kept her locked up in the kennel to keep her away from my older dog so she wouldn't hurt herself, but I have been keeping her out the last 2 days, and there is no change.  She is a monster!  She won't sit, she won't leave anything alone, she now growls and barks at people...none of these things is normal for her.  HELP!  She is a baby hell hound.  Anywho, this morning she was so bad...I was going crazy!  Anyway, again, work backons me. I must go.  I just needed to vent. =)
