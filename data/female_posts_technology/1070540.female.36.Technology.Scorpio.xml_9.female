She wants to live with me so bad.  She says her daddy threw away her diary because she wrote in it that she wants to live with me.  He threw away both of her diaries...What kind of a dad would do that??  I know...a dad that never wanted you in the first place... He is such a sorry dad.....  now look at me... i have 3 children by a man who never wanted them....and I will never have children by a man who wanted  the child he had...(his ex will never know how lucky she was).   Why cant all dads want the children they create??  But its fine with me he doesnt want them..but he uses them as pawns to hurt me....GOSHHH  WHAT AN ASS I was married tooo...
