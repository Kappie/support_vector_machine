Hi  A new Iraqi Blog   urlLink http://iraq-free.blogspot.com/   By Ladybird    Ladybird says;   I live in The Netherlands i am iraqi myself.   I started my blog and the goal of my blog pickingup  the news from here and there over Iraq and trying to disccus it with other iraqis or Americans or anybody intersted Right now i am busy making another blog it's name *Baghdad Dweller *this gonna be a very diffrent kind of blog.    Perhaps we can expect some humour from Ladybird, at Iraq Voice Forums in  urlLink funny jokes  a Ladybird posts regular jokes (Joined: April 15 2004. Location: Syrian Arab Republic) with Ahmed333 (Joined: April 29 2004. Location: Netherlands). Hmm, there cannot be too many Iraqi Ladybirds connected to the Netherlands, but Ahmed (and versions thereof) is a frequent enough name, there are probably  urlLink quite a few  of them online.   Looking forward to the future fruits of your busy blog making Ladybird.
