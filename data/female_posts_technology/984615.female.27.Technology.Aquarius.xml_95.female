The 14-year-old boy required three stitches to his left index finger but was not seriously injured in the attack early Monday morning, Housing Authority spokeswoman May Tham said.   A cleaning crew drained the fountain the next morning and found it had contained two piranhas -- apparently pets that had been abandoned in the fountain at a public housing project.   Ming Pao Daily News ran a photo of the dead piranhas and one of the boy, with his left hand in a sling and blood on his short pants."
