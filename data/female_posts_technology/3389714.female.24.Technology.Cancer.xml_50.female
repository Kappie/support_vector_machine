I opened my tiny closet and pulled out a red shirt that was recently hung on a white hanger… and yanked out a pair of blue jeans…went to the dresser and pulled out fresh undies and socks ..once again only the socks matched…I have an unusual way of getting dressed I usually put on my socks before my pants I know I’m a bit odd… when I was finally dressed I felt as if my shirt had shrunk in the dryer ..and with the new low rise jeans fashion didn’t want the world to see my backside ..so I put on a long tankie underneath.. so currently I’m wearing blue jeans, white socks, back tankie that sticks out of my red shirt and a cream colored sweater.. forgot the color of my undies ..sorry guys…so it’s 1:18 pm and I feel as if I lost my sense of style.. I mean there was a time when my sleepwear used to match ..along with my undies… I used to plan out what I was going to wear for the week during the weekend.. now it’s just whatever fits and is clean put it on.. and call it a day…   Question of the Day…?  Do you have an unusual style of getting dressed…?
