I'm blocking a scarf on my ironing board right now, which sucks for two reasons:    The pins aren't staying too well, since the foam is a total of maybe 1/16" thick.     The board isn't nearly long enough for the scarf, so I have one end of it doubled over.  It's a mostly acrylic blend, so it should dry fairly quickly anyway.      So a blocking table would be wonderful.  I might have to put my head together with the Boy and design one to build up in his dad's shop one weekend.
