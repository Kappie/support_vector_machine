I thought it would be a good way to keep in touch cuz some of u are in UK, TX, FL, CA, WI, CT, and NJ…plus I get an artificial high when I’d get a comment or the counter on my page would increase by one ..knowin that someone out there just got a glimpse of my world…it’s probably the only time where I’m totally enlightened …and utterly happy… I never knew my joy for writing stupid stuff would create such a problem…I just wanted to write and have fun…sorry….  -kRiS   Question of the Day…  Now What…?
