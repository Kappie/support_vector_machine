Anyway.. back in town this week.  good to be home, weather is hot - i'm hoping it will cool down for camping next week.  but if not i'm sure an enlightening time will still be had by all participants.  have i mentioned that my birthday is in eight days!   question of the week:   how many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsie roll pop?  anyone....
