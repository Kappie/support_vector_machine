The key to etiquette is being sensitive and putting yourself in the shoes of others.  So many times I'll tell somebody that I'm busy, or have somebody at my desk.  They keep sending me messages.    Do you have any other IAM advice?  http://msn.match.com/msn/article.aspx?articleid=2389=516164=541888
