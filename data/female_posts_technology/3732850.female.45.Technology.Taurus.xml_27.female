The question of Euthanasia is based on our value system. The way our values are arranged in individual personalities result in different beliefs and attitudes.   I personally think that one of the major contributors to the current problem with the moral issues of Euthanasia is due partly to the successes of medical science, not its failures. The increase in advanced medical technologies, especially life-sustaining ones, has brought the more recent focus on the various moral issues involved in euthanasia. When machines, tubes and computers take over, we sometimes loose sight of what is truly best for the patient and compassion along with common sense sometimes seem to suffer. Fortunately, there seems to be an increased awareness of the intrusiveness of modern technology. Is keeping someone alive always the right thing to do?  I have a 21 year old son with many health problems, some of them life threatening. I have seen the pain and the suffering that my son has experienced. I have felt the helplessness while sitting at his bedside unable to relieve his pain and suffering, wondering how much more can he take or can we take.   At age eight, our son and family were sent on a Make-A-Wish trip because he was not expected to live to be nine years old. We, as a family, deal with our son’s daily intravenous infusions lasting up to 11 hours, central line dressing changes, diabetes, blood transfusions, regular lab work, and constant trips to the doctor. Our son has undergone more than 30 operations, including one in which part of his stomach was removed. Along with numerous tumors being removed, he has also undergone a pancreas transplant. His transplant failed and he is presently on the waiting list, with high hopes that his next transplant will be a success. With the insurance company’s limit of only two transplants, if this next one fails, we as a family have to come up with the $200,000.00 needed to pay for another transplant in hopes of prolonging our son’s life.  He is also immune deficient meaning that he is always at risk of developing serious complications from only the simplest infections. Of course, we will do anything to keep our son with us, but we know that because of his complicated life threatening health problems, there may be a day when there is no more anyone can do.   I am ashamed to admit that there have been a few times, when we as a parents, have asked ourselves, how much more we should put our child through, but somehow, we have known to keep trying. I only hope that when, and if, the day comes, when there are no other healthcare choices, we have the option to make the decision that is best for our son and our family. I believe that we, along with our son, should have the right to choose whether he has suffered enough.   My own personal experiences influence my feelings about euthanasia and its morality.  I strongly believe that individuals should be allowed the right to choose how and when our lives should end in the case of terminal or incurable illness.
