I know one day he is going to make it big.  I am so proud of him.  He came home yesterday and was telling us that a company that didnt even return a call on his resume, he will be teaching their whole IT security department... :-)  can you see my proudness showing through???????????  I keep telling him he is so smart.  One day he will realize it.  He is even going to have to go to California for SANS training.   My heart just swells for him.  Our kids are doing wonderful.  Kimberly broke my heart. She brought a test to me and Ken and she said.  I know I am not doing well....I need some help.  My heart broke into a million peice.  Bless kens heart.  He is going to get her to read to him every night.  Have I said how lucky I am lately?????????  I am extremely lucky.  Thought lately I feel as if he is so distant from me.  I dont want that to happen.  I truely love him.  I feel that I never knew what love was til now. I hope I dont screw it up...  well gotta go.
