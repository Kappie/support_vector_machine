I received a wonderful card and letter form my son in prison today brought tears to my eyes and warmed my heart. Just as I finish reading his card and letter my daughter(Yes I have a 26 year old daughter also)called and wanted to stop by and drop off a book for her little brother. She and I have one of those love/hate mother daughter relationship unfortunately. I really love her and wish we could get along but she thinks she's the mother and I'm the child. Her father was German-Jew and sometimes I wonder if she resents my being black. I know it sounds weird but remember the movie Imitation of Life. I hope one day her and I can have a better relationship but I'm not going to drive myself crazy worrying about it. I know I did my best I could raising them all. I was a single parent. They had everything love, material things etc. As I looked at her today I tried to see myself in her. She is a very beautiful girl. I know she has my fight back mentality but she takes it to the extremes. In other words she can be quite a bitch. Which is not a bad thing but you must have discretion and tack. Well I guess I'll go get ready for Happy Friday and possibly my last day working half day :( But it's good I have a job that was supportive of me for seven months and was/is willing to work with me through my knee surgery and recovery. Well Pre Happy Friday !!! Peace :)
