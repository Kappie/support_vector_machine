I thought the Catholic church was having enough problems keeping its members around.  I understand that they want to keep tradition alive (and I agree with that, having converted to Catholicism myself to be a member of a denomination that was rife with ritual and tradition), but denying an eight year old her first communion because she's got an allergy to wheat?  It sounds to me like some exception could be made, especially since it's a  urlLink  sacrament     and if you don't received them you can, like, go to Hell or something.        I was at a wedding this summer (a very traditional wedding in an old Methodist Church) and the bride and groom took their own version of communion with their personal holy food--Sprite and cheese for the groom, and popcorn and lemonade for the bride.      That's something that makes sense to me.  If Christ can indeed be found every where, he can be found in cheese as well as wheat laden wafers as well as rice laden wafers.  Give the kid some communion!
