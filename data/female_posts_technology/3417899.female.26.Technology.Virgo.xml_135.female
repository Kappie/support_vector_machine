But every time I start to write of him, of how he is and what he's done to my family, I get so overwhelmed - with anger, sadness, and hate - it becomes too much.  Too much to summarize in a blog. Too much to dive into without pages and pages of years of history.  So here I am again, bursting with anguish for what he's putting my parents through, lacking the strength to put it in writing.   He's my uncle. A blood relative. Someone who, in a normal family (if there even is such a thing) would be a person to trust. And yet, there is no one I trust less.   Have you seen the movie "Catch me if you can"? That story of Frank Abagnale Jr., a successful con artist who managed to pass himself off as several identities...? I was watching that movie and thinking that's him. That's Ralph.  The charisma to convince everybody (including yourself) you are somebody you've never been.  The charm to fool people.  The audacity to lie and to con and to cheat and to steal under the pretense of a lie.  A pathology. A pathological liar.  I am sure these people, Frank Jr. and my uncle - have some mental default.   The funny (or sad) thing is - he calls himself Orthodox. He wears his beard long, wears a "kippa" and a hat, wears the dark suit.  He keeps a kosher kitchen - separating meat utensils from milk utensils.  He goes to the synagogue and spends his days reading the bible.  He's even said he is two months away form becoming a Rabbi.   It's always bothered me - how people that pretend to be G-d fearing and religious are later discovered to be the worst criminals. How someone who says that being religious is the most important thing in his life is, in reality, so far from being what Judaism is all about. Case in point: Ralph has beat up his ex-wife, abandoned his children, cheated (and still cheats) on his new wife/wives, stolen (and still steals) from strangers and from family, lied, disrespected his father...   For some reason we have higher expectations from those who are religious. Believing their religion guides them in a better way. For some reason we are more disappointed when they fail than when secular people fail. They, the religious, should have known better. Could have done better.  Like those priests that molested boys.    Hypocrisy.    For the past year or so, my husband and I have been supporting my parents in their battles with Ralph. Providing a listening ear, paying lawyers, paying courts, paying debts.  My husband has been a saint - taking over the responsibility of looking after my parents, listening to them, providing insight. Agreeing to loan them our money, dozens of thousands of dollars - our future.  He's been my strength when I couldn't take it anymore.   And now things have taken a turn for the worst. Another legal tangle for my parents, another loss of a source of income -and we can both see what's coming. More loans needed.  We want to help.  I  want to help. They are my parents and I owe them my life and everything I have got.  But I see it happening... I see my husband backing away... I see him reconsidering the risks... I see him fearing our future. We don't have much left to give.  And I see it coming. The battle.  Between my rationale and my conscience.  Between my need to lead my own adult life and my need to bail my parents out again.  Between my husband and I. Between us.  I can see it coming and tearing my life apart.  And I am afraid.    Fear.    I live in a beautiful neighborhood in Palo Alto. My apartment complex has 7 pools, a tennis court, gym, exercise classes, a movie theater, pool table, ping pong, and other perks. I have a maid that comes every two weeks to clean up after us.  My husband and I eat out regularly. I shop quite often. We travel.   My father is sleeping on a sofa in the living room of the apartment he is sharing with my uncle in NY. He borrows my money for daily necessities.  My parent's house in Israel used to be beautiful - a well groomed house in a rich neighborhood. If you walk in it today you will see the signs of the hard years on the walls, the furniture, in the air. The only time my parent splure on something like new clothes is when I buy them. They know what it was like to be rich. Now they know what it is like to be poor.   Yet here I am - living lavishly, far away.   How can I  NOT  feel guilty?
