Did not use the digital scale .. how odd that i get different results with the digital one - according to where I put it on the floor or in the bathroom. I've been eating well. Am so proud of myself. I haven't been binge-ing on stuff at all. Just two - three meals plus little snacks (healthful snacks) in between .. I do treat myself to a little something from time to time, but it's not excessive.  I tried on some of my old clothes. I have a Size 10 (UK) pants, that I used to love to wear and now I can't fit it past my upper thighs. I have a beautiful black shift dress, the perfect black dress which I could fit in last when I was about 145 - 150lbs in 1998 (when I went to Paris) .. and now I can't fit it around my butt and boobs. Finally, a pair of Size 12 UK pants that I can't zip up .. I can get it past my thighs, hips but it just won't close! Maybe another 10lbs for that one.   So okay .. now I'm 165 - 170lbs, Size 12 US, Size 14 UK. My waist size is either 34" (ugh!) or  33" .. gross, I know. My hips and top are 42" or so. I have to face the facts that I AM a fat girl, obese, unhealthy .. I keep on justifying it you know .. like at least my guy (then) finds me attractive even like this or it's not so bad unlike some people or I don't really want it enough. But I am that bad, that far along .. I am so heading for an early grave if I keep on putting weight like this.   Next milestone, in 2 months - June .. that sounds reasonable, would be 155lbs, 32" waist, 40" hips/top. Hopefully a Size 10 US  Size 12 UK. I am supposed to be able to fit into those clothes - 12 UK pants and shift dress but I think as I kept on putting on weight (yo-yo) my body composition gets worse .. so more fat. Will need a little more time to tone up. Now is the time to step up with the workouts.    Third milestone in another 2 months - August 2004 .. would be 145lbs, 30 - 31" waist, 38 - 39" hips/top. That's where I was before. And by then I should be able to fit into all my OLD clothes .. Size 12 UK just nicely and perfectly. I think at that time I could fit into a Size 10 UK but it would be a little snug.   The FINAL 10lbs, will take 4 months .. to really really tone it all up. So by the end of the year I'll have my perfect body. I didn't like the feeling of NOT being able to fit into all those clothes. I look at it and I go .. was I really that small? And when I was at that point I was always thinking I was SO fat and ugly and needed to lose another 10lbs to be 'perfect' .. how stupid.   Then .. then .. the most important part is maintaining my weight. No more overeating when I hit a crisis and 6 months down the line find out that I'm fat AGAIN! Never never never never again.   I am so glad to be seeing some progress. Yaay! Imagine if I actually did put in more effort with the workouts .. then there would be more results.
