We want to help kids that are struggling because of family situations. I feel her pain that she has to set back and let the parents be, sometime all we can do is just be there for them when they need somoene to just talk, too.  I liked how Deb Sullivan called her garden her friend and how she compared the twin nephews and the garden on how they were the same. Like when she was saying that she planted them in her world, build a fence around them to keep them safe, and how she has "weed out" their negatives out of their lives. You can very clearly see how much she lovs Jake and Ben.
