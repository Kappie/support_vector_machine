On the baking directions, on the back of the box, they had something like this:     TYPE OF CRUST  PREHEAT AND BAKE AT  OVEN RACK POSITION  BAKE TIME    Crisper Crust  400 F  Center (6-8 Inch from bottom of oven)  24-26 minutes    Softer Crust  400 F  Second from bottom (5-7 inch from bottom of oven)  26-28 minutes      High Altitude (Over 3,500 ft)    400 F  Center   25 to 27 minutes     High Altitude???!!!?? Is that a type of crust (TALL pizza)? Or does that mean that if I'm baking the pizza on top of a moutain I should bake it a minute longer?   Maybe it's my lacking English skills, but I was stumped.  :-)
