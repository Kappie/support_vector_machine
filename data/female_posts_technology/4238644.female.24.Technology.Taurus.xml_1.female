If only I had a bottomless pit of money I could go there to ski the whole season without having to work!      Hopefully I can get a kickass job there which lets me ski a lot. I've managed to find a few other aussies and a girl from England doing the same as me so perhaps i've already found a few friends I can meet up with over there. Only 9 1/2 weeks to go! wuwu!      Only downer is having to leave behind my friends. I'd love to take so many people with me but alas, its not to be. I also hate having to move out of my awesome unit. It's not easy finding such a good place and after seeing other friends looking for places close to the city with all the ins and outs, only reminds me how lucky I was to find this place. Ah well, I'm sure I'll find something good when I come home. Not something to stress too much over now. TO CANADA!
