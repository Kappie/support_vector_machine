Iraqi Lady  is worth clicking around, there are a range of sites there, from  urlLink Artist's  and  urlLink Writer's  to  urlLink Princess's  and  urlLink Queen's.  Some of these sites are multilingual, so if you are language deficient (like me) you'll be happy to find, with a bit of a look about, some english and also soothing visuals if you can't read the script.   Iraqi Lady  also has a range of  urlLink news links,  from Arabic CNN  BBC to Aljazeera.    urlLink Iraqi Forum for Democracy  is also worth checking.    Iraqi Lady  is now in the sidebar Online Culture links, and  Iraqi Forum for Democracy  in the reference links if you're looking for them later on.
