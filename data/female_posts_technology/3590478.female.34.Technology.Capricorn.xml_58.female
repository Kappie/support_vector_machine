Me calling a mass of incandescent gas my home planet is appropriate on a level in which you’ve come to expect.) I take my heroes, gods and potential slayers very seriously.  It may seem there are quite a lot but it still doesn’t dismiss the fact that, while I’m easily entertained, I’m not easily impressed.    urlLink http://www.mil-millington.com/    urlLink http://www.hollisgillespie.com/index.htm    urlLink http://www.disgruntledhousewife.com/    urlLink http://www.dubberley.com/    urlLink http://margaretcho.net/blog/    urlLink http://vrya.net/bdb/index.php    urlLink http://www.fast-rewind.com/    urlLink http://kuenai.net/    urlLink http://bloglife.net/users/rsingh/    urlLink http://www.vaptek.com/
