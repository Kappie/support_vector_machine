I thought I have cried my last tear and have wasted enough time on this, but obviously not. I still have to give them more of my time and more of my sweat and tears.  I fucking want them out of my head! I want to move on and I want to hate them w/ everything that I have so I won't spend any more time w/ this feeling of emptiness, loneliness, betrayal and abandonment. I am tired of certain people throwing this in my face and using it against me! I fucking want you to lay off! I am who I am and I did what I did.  It does not change me I am still the same person.  Take me as I am or BACK THE FUCK OFF!  I am tired of being that naive girl.  NO MORE! I will not let anyone walk on me, take advantage of me or make me feel like shit anymore.  I am sorry that I am only human!
