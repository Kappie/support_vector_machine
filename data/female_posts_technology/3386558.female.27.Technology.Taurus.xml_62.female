       
      i took the day off, purchased a new computer, saw harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban, set up the new computer, and cooked dinner for my husband and mother. not too bad for this poor-old-girl living on dimetapp and dayQuil. i really was sick today so i don't feel guilty for calling in. not one bit.
