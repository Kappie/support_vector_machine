I was just barely a teen when I came across a single daisy on the cover of a book (Sci Fi about Post Nuke America) it was beautiful, Now around the same time, I heard that rats, roaches, dandelions and daisies were 4 things that would survive a nuclear holocaust without having to mutate.(does anyone know if there is truth to this?? Nah never mind I prefer to have some fantasies propagated)  Over the years I have drawn that flower often, sometimes well, and others...well... LOL  when I was 31 I got one of the first drawings I had done inconspicuously put onto myself as a tattoo, For me it was an expression of my independence, and because I am a survivor.  I like my Tat , I drew it , they copied it meticulously and well, the colors are bright and the lines are delicate and clean , to me it is an artistic endeavor.......Mine.
