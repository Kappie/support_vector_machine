So, I've managed to read two whole pages in the equivalent of one working day.  Management should be impressed - not.    This is simply not fair. How can I be expected to get a lively and exciting blog up and running when I have to read this crap? I need to be doing fun things. This document is 127 pages and I'm a very old lady. I'm reading my life away.    Oh fuck.
