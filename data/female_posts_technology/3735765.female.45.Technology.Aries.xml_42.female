When many are coming and going, and there is little quiet, give us grace to remember him who knew neither impatience of spirit nor confusion of work, but in the midst of all his labors kept a tranquil heart, at leisure from itself to serve and sympathize; through the same Jesus Christ our Lord.  Amen.  The Book of Worship of the United Methodist Church   There comes a time when assistance is needed to be asked for in order to complete a task to meet the bigger picture of the goals set forth and one should not be afraid to ask.  After all, have you not heard the buzz going around at someone's funeral wherein they were saying, "Why didn't _______ (you fill in the blank), just ask for help? We would have been glad to help them?"  People are just afraid of asking for help -- feeling like that it is downgrading to admit that they need assistance and/or just plain ol' too proud to ask.  Part of being humble though is knowing just when to ask for assistance.  There are many organizations available to provide assistance for when you need that little extra to get you through a particularily rough period of time.  One of the more widely known charitable organizations is the  urlLink St. Vincent de Paul Society ; there are others more locally known which can be found through your local Churches and/or phone books.  I am not sure who coined the phrase, "Be it ever so humble, there is no place like home", but that phrase seems to eminate that being of a humble heart is truly a home.  One must remember that when things start getting rough and you are trying to keep a home together, it is best to start by humbling oneself to ask for assistance.  There is no time like the present...  Have a humble heart -- Have a humble home!!
