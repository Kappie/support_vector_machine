Can you imagine people exchanging files merely by touching each other.....And yes, we are talking about actual information files being exchanged through human touch. Now this is the latest patent obtained by Microsoft , the place I work for. Phew ! The idea is about using a person's body to network multiple devices together.I gotto know about this through a third-party website ...This is definitely exciting and more exciting is the fact that we will soon be getting rid of batteries for our dependency on them to power up the devices we use.We will very soon , see solar energy powering devices like Pocket PC's . I recently read somehwere that Konarka Technologies(http://www.konarka.com) is developing nanotechnology-based solar panels that can be woven into the fabric of people's clothes. These panels will be able to make electricity from any kind of light, not just sunlight, allowing users to be charging their handheld or smartphone almost constantly.They are even hoping that the device covers could be made out of such solar panels , so they can be charged as they are being used ! Well, it's not gonna be long when thes etechnologies will be a part of my favourite devices, handheld's and smart phones! The speed is amazing!
