Well that is how I feel.  I try not to cry..I hate crying at work..but the tears just flow....DAMNIT!!  I just keep thinking...I am loosing 2  very important people in my life.  I dont know what to do to get him back.  I am just going to keep trying.  He says he loves me... he has never lied to me .. but right now..I just dont feel loved.    My heart is truely aching...I mean it really hurts... its not just a phrase.
