I don’t remember it being a big deal when I was younger, but it seems that when I had children, dirty shoes and socks became important. My children hide their tennis shoes because they know that I will throw them in the washer if they are dirty. They tell me that dirty tennis shoes are the best, but I have a hard time dealing with them. Dirty flip flops, they don’t survive in our house. In the washer they go. When my children were little and they wore the little white baby Stride-Rite shoes, I would polish them every night before I went to bed. I found some kind of satisfaction in seeing those little white shoes all ready for the next day. Maybe my obsession came from the little white corrective shoes my son wore from the time he was about 3 months old. I had no choice of colors when he was first fitted for his size double zero shoes so white was what we had to take. His two little shoes were attached to a metal bar that the doctor would adjust when we would go for checkups. I remember that when Grandpa would hold our son, especially after working outside, the dirt from his clothing would rub off on his little white shoes. I never commented on it. I just knew that I would clean them up at the end of the day. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that when I was a little girl I had to wear braces and corrective shoes also. I was born with clubbed feet and my parents were told that I might never walk normally. I remember growing to despise those corrective shoes and braces. All the other girls my age had cute little dress up shoes and mine were just icky brown corrective shoes. I guess when I was a baby they were white but for some reason the only color available for my size was white or black. Every time I had to go for a brace fitting and new shoes, I would ask, “Is there any other color?” The answer was always the same. I used to be almost relieved when I was told that I had to have more surgery because it meant that I would get to wear cool white casts that could be painted and decorated instead of those icky brown corrective shoes.    I remember when our son was born and we were told that he had clubbed feet; all I could think about was those icky brown shoes I wore when I was little. Fortunately, corrective shoes have improved since I was born and there is some variety to choose from.
