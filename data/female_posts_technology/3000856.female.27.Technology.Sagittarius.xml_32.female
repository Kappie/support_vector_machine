Anyway, the show went ok last night. I had a blast. Some of my real close friends came out to support me and there were a few there that I expected that never showed. Marcella was there. Man that chick fuckin rocks. She definitely turned the heads of a lot of my friends. She is beautiful and she has an amazing personality. I went to breakfast w/ a few of my friends and there was a group of older people at a table by us and they were looking at me like I was a freak. I was all dark and dreary looking last night. I got home at 5 and pretty much passed out! I go in for my tests Mon to see if I have MS. I don't think I have yet blogged about that. I have been having some signs and symptoms so I talked to one of the DRs at my hospital and she examined me. She said she wanted me to get a couple of tests done and one of the tests is one that I do on patients. That should be strange. Anyway, I am so sick of my body. Can I trade it in for a new one? LOL I had a brief encounter w/ cancer a few years ago, I had appendicitis and a polyp on my uterus that I had removed in Jan and now this. I have not talked to anyone about this yet because I am hoping it is nothing and I don't want to start freaking about something that I know nothing about. Although I have to say that is also why I have been so upset lately I just pawn a lot of it off on other situations.
