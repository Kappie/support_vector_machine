You can only be one type so if you're truly more than one type, which one best fits you in general?   I am old school r, says profound things, may not be the "in thing" but still admired and still revered and often useful (sampling)   2. If you were a movie, what genre would you be? You can mix this one by the way.   Documentary...insightful, not the "in thing" but can teach you a lot if you jus lissen   3. If you were a color, what would you be and why?   Red because it's a showstopper (color of stop signs and red light) , fiery, signals danger ahead, sexy   4. If you were a piece of jewelry, what would you be?      A diamond...in the rough...with a few inclusions.     5. If you were the president of the United States, what would  you  do?   Take care of the problems HERE before worrying about what the fuck other countries are doing.   6. If you were having a wedding tomorrow, what would it be like?   On an island at sunset. Me in a simple straight white dress...him in all white, everyone in white. Us both barefoot (with the requisite pedicures of course!). Us saying vows we wrote to each other. Only about 10-15 people in attendance.   7. If you were given the chance to meet anyone, who would you meet in the film biz and the music biz?   You can pick 4 of each.   Film--Sanaa Lathan, Denzel, Al Pacino and Tom Hanks Music--Jilly from Philly, Anthony Hamilton, Lufer (I'll take big or little at this point), and the Whispers and/or The Gap Band (sorry I cheated--that's five) oh let me really cheat---Stevie Wonder   8. If you could go on a date with your dream man, what would you do on the date and what your dream man be like?   I don't know if there is sucha thing as a dream date. I figure something different would be to have a picnic in a park where they were also playing live music. Then it would be great to finish the evening with a nice stroll by a lakefront, just talking and enjoying each other's company. Right now, my dream man would be simply someone who is really interested in me and is willing to help me grow and accepts me for who I am...faults and all.  Someone who will LOVE me and in turn help me to love myself....because somedays I'm not sure that I do.   9. If you could be any age for the rest of your life, what age would you be and why?   My mid twenties have not been particularly happy. I've been having a good time socially, but overall they leave a lot to be desired. So I say 31 maybe because then I'm officially in my 30s...not 30.   10. If you were forced to be a doctor, what kind would you be and why?   A doctor of philosophy...in other words a Phd. A non-teaching Phd...more like a researcher and writer. No medical doctor. Nope...   11. If you were a painting, what would you look like?      Not a painting...but a black and white enlarged photo of me sitting alone on the beach, my head leaned back enjoying the wind of my face. The only color would be my hair and the polish on my toes, half hidden as they dig into the sand. Hmmm...I need to get someone to take that picture     12. If you had to choose between love or friendship, which would you choose?   I cant choose. You need both. I want to be my lover's best friend. And I love my best friends. It's all intertwined.   13. If you had to be a teacher, what would you teach and why?   I would teach a black literature class--20th century or  maybe a journalism course.   14. If you found out you were Princess Diana's daughter or son and Prince was your father, how would you deal with it?   WTF??? Prince as in The Artist Formally Knows As????   15. If you weren't you, who would you be?   I can't imagine being anyone but me. I could say someone else. But I figure God made me me for a reason. And God don't make no junk :-)
