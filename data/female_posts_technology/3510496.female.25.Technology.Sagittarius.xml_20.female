Put a small piece of bread   insider cookie jar to help keep your baked goods fresh longer.    Put a box of baking soda (expose) in the fridge and freezer for odour control.  Ever get those stains on your tupperware/containers that contain chilli/tomato-based sauces? Spray them with non-stick cooking spray before pouring in sauce.      I'd personally experience this because I am a celery lover. I usually buy one big plastic of celery that can last me for a week for my salad and juices. But I'd realise that after 4 days the vege turns bit soggy-ish, despite storing in the fridge. My House-Wise solution, wrap celery in aluminium foil, put in the fridge --- it will keep for weeks!  Poke an egg with a very fine sewing needle before hard-boiling. The egg will peel with ease. REMEMBER - poke it, not crack it, ok.    Another hard-boiling egg tippy. Add a pinch of salt before boiling to prevent cracking.  To keep potatoes from budding, place an apple in the bag of potatoes.      To get the most juice out of fresh lemons, bring them to a room temperature and roll them under your palm against the kitchen counter before squeezing. You can also insert and twist a fork in the lemon while squeezing the juices out.  If you accidentally over-salt a dish while it's still cooking, drop in a peeled potato. It absorbs the excess salt for an instant "fix-me-up"!  To determine egg's freshness, immerse it in a pot of cool, salted water. If it sinks, it's fresh. If it rises to the surface, throw it away larrrrr.....  Always breathe through your mouth, never your nose to prevent crying when peeling onions. Wahhhhh, this one never try, but normally I put on my specs when chopping onions/chilli stuffs. Occasionally, I will 'cry'.   And my dear homemaker mommy's tip is to go and wash my feet. Strange enough, it works lehhhh...
