To tell you a little bit about myself and my eating habits, I love junk food - chips, chocolate you name it. I like to eat large quantities of food as well - put a big bag of chips in front of me and I could easily go through the whole bag if that little voice in my head would just shut up! My weight tends to fluctuate by 5-10 lbs. I will go on a diet and lose weight then gain it back. Before I went to University I weighed 155lbs, in third year I weighed 175lbs.I would like to get back to 155lb by the end of October.   So my stats are:   Height: 5'7 Weight: 167 Waist: 35 Hips: 42 Thunder Thighs: 25 Arms: 12 Ribcage: 33 Boobies: 38   My goal for the end of this month is to lose 6lbs. I plan to control the amount of junk food I eat, and incorporate more meat into my diet. I don't eat a lot of meat and that leads me to more carbs.I would like to reduce the amount of carbs I eat b/c Ifeel that it just sticks to myalready bigbones. I still need to have some carbs - because we all know what happens when you don't eat any (thanks to Heather's graphic discribtions) and because I love them so much I could never fully give them up. So my plan is to have carbs for one meal plus one snack. And by carbs I mean bad carbs - bread, pasta, rice.   As for my excersise routine I plan to up the now two times a week to four. This will include a 30 min run or elipitcal and 30 minutes of weight lifting. I get very bored of the gym so I will try to run outside more. Also with my new found love/hate for mountain biking I'm going to try and get out more on the hills.   Well that's it for me. Let's get this party started (expect no popand chips allowed!)
