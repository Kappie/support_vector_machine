We had everything from formal gowns, to confirmation dresses, bridesmaid dresses, wedding gowns, etc.  Some girls had hats, others had white gloves, it was great fun.  We served tea and punch and coffee, and fruit and goodies.  While the girls and their moms were munching, we went around the room so everyone could share the story behind their dress and their tea cup.    The tables looked great.  One of the ladies in the church has a doll collection that she brought in, along with some quilts and quilt blocks for table decorations.  Everything was very springy, pinks, purples, greens, yellows and blues.  I'm glad the weather was so warm yesterday, it really felt like spring.  Seeing all the tea cups makes me want to collect tea cups and have my own tea party (not that many people drink tea anymore).  Ah well, our tea party was fun and I think everyone enjoyed it.
