I don't see myself posting enough to maintain a fan base of happy, adoring fans but Angie has been kind enough to grant me priviledges here.    Most of my posts will probably center around the trials and tribulations of dating someone new. I've been seeing him an entire month and in Annaville, that's about 3 weeks too long. But to make an attempt at keepinghappy, adoring fans I'll keep him around a while longer to entertain y'all.    Be prepared for the first three posts that will be made shortly. It's a cut and paste from some e-mails that went out regarding the first month with the aforementioned dude-de-jour. I blew a couple of people away with my candor in post #2, so I'll try to keep comments more PG in future posts. Must keep the fans happy and adoring......    Wahoo!  Anna
