But honestly, I think I would be lost without work.  I get bored very easily.  Ask anybody.  They'll tell you.  I can jump off of  the worlds largest and craziest roller coaster, turn around and say "Now what - I'm bored"  In fact, I am bored right now.  So, you see, not having to work would actually be bad for me.  I would go crazy, I think.  I don't think I could find enough amusing things to do every day for the rest of my life if I wasn't at work 1/3 of my life and sleeping another 1/3 of it.    HA...I say "my life", as if I had one.  Funny.  So, a little about what has been going on the last few years.  Well, as I was graduating High School one of my ex-boyfriends was trying to talk me into giving him another chance.  When his attempts failed (miserably) he had one of his friends talk to me online.  ***Guys, if you are reading this - DON'T DO THIS!  STUPID!  BAD!***  You see, as soon as this friend started talking to me, I found he was very easy to talk to and a lot of fun.  I ended up waiting for him to get online whenever I could, and we talked until the wee hours of the morning.  So, 2 months later, we met face to face.  It's funny, we lived 1/2 hour away from each other for so many years, and this is how we meet.  After that point, we were inseparable.  We dated for 4 1/2 years, and got married in January of 2003.    This past year, our first life changing decision was made.  He got a job offer in another state.  I had a great job which I had been working there for 3 years.  These people were like my family!  But, I knew this was a wonderful opportunity.  So, we moved.  We don't have any family for 600 miles each way, and not a friend in the state.  I had a dog though.  She was lonely too, as her companion, a quirky cocker spaniel, past away from cancer this past summer.  And so, we bought a puppy from a rescue shelter.    Well, now I feel like I have 2 kids.  My older dog is now acting the age of the puppy.  So now, although I still have a lack of people friends, I have 2 wonderful dogs I come home to.  So even if I wanted to have friends, I don't have time for them now.  *blah*  So, in a nutshell, there is my life for the past 5 years.  Boring, huh?  Yup.  There has been some drama and some excitement, but fortunately for you, I am not going to privilege you with this information.    And as for you people who are wanting to correct my spelling and grammar....don't.  Please.  I really don't care.  If I wanted to get my blog graded or criticized for spelling, I would email it to my old teachers.  Thanks.
