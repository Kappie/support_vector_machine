Like having a call scheduled in an hour and a half where I'm supposed to review the clone of our development database, which has yet to be rebuilt for me, which means I can't go in and clean it up prior to the call, which means I get to spend half of the call reminding our consultant that he doesn't need to worry about half of the crap in there...  Don't get me wrong -- my weekend was good.  80 degrees and sunny and it only took one Claritin per day to keep my allergies under control.  And I finally got around to my spring cleaning.  And although I'm not  urlLink dating my ex-boyfriend , I did join him for mimosas on Sunday, which was nice.  Except...  ...for the fact that I didn't interpret "I'm meeting Ben and his buddies for a few drinks later" to mean "Ben's setting me up with some blonde", so when Peach and I finished dinner and headed over to E for a couple beers, we sat next to them.    At least it was free entertainment.
