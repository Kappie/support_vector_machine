Then he said "look at me for a minute", I did and he smiled. I asked "What?" and he said "Your eyes". "My eyes, what?" I asked. "Your eyes are the same color as your shirt. Wow".  We smiled and there was a minute of silence, before we continued to discuss my sales funnel.   This can't be all in my mind. Is it?  Am I giving off a scent? Whatever it is, it is dangerous.  But oh, so fun .
