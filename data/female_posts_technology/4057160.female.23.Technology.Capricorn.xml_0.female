Quoting him, "if u r open to all kind of ideas, there is a lot of learning happening..  its at ur discreation to store or eliminate data. At the end of the day the data collected by u makes u more unique. But, at the same time, the data we need we dont have...the data we have we dont need".  This is such a contradiction. Does this mean we should stop trying? After all we do not achieve the outcome that we so desire. Is it wrong data or is itwrongly interpreted data? Possibly, all that we need to do is to look at things from a different angle. Our closed minds cause all the problems. Maybe, after carefully analyzing the situation the graph might just curve upwards thandrooping down.  Need to think abt this...
