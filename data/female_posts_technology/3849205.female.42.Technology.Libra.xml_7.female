Then my daughter called and asked if I wanted to go to the coast and have dinner...I wasnt hungry in the least but I thought it would be fun so I said sure.   It turned out that we instead went to the casino for dinner. Keeping in mind I wasnt even hungry I had a compleat dinner. I was so stuffed. It was so good. I could have even just ate things legal on phase one but no I went totally off it.   Rather that beat myself up over what happen, yesterday I just started again. I was so full from the day before and due to the heat all I had was water and a small bowl of low carb ice cream.   This brings me up to today. It is supposed to be cooler. Today I had a shrimp salad for lunch. I later had two small chicken breasts with mushrooms and olives for dinner. I also had a small amount of low carb ice cream. I think I did well.
