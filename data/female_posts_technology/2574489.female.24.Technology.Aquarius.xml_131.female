Apart from her immediate family (husband, children) she has no other relatives.  In Houston, she has plenty of  kababayans  * ; folks from her hometown, people she grew up with, even a first cousin or two.  Every time she gets together with them they urge her to move there. She smiles, she agrees it would be great. But secretly, she thinks to herself that absence makes the heart grow fonder, and proximity makes it cold.    This woman's philosophy is that the further away she is from Filipinos, especially other Filipino women, the less intrigue and strife she'll have to deal with.  She has relatives in California, plenty of them.  And she tells me she shudders to think what it would be like if she lived close to them.  She's afraid of the jealousy, the comparisons, the gossip, the back-stabbing.   Is this how women are? Is this how Filipino women are?  I am asking this because I don't like to think that this is how we women are like. Especially the Filipino women. But why is that stereotype so often reinforced? Even in the blogging world, there is still this type of intrigue and in-fighting among Filipino women. I mention Filipino blogs because that's most of what attracts me in the blogging world. But I know that its not just Filipino women that exhibit this catty behavior.    Why do we do this to ourselves? Why do we tear other women down? Lose friendships over men, gossip, form exclusive cliques? Someone prove me wrong! Someone tell me of good friendship stories; frienships that last, women who get along and handle conflict well.    Maybe the in-fighting happens because as women, we are not taught how to handle conflict well at all. We are taught to avoid conflict. To get along with everyone. When conflict happens, we have no skills to cope with it. This is just a theory that got formulated while writing this entry.  Anyone have any other ideas?    * Filipino word for people from your own hometown
