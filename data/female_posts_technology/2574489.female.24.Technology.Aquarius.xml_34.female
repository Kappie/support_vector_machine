Had a small bowl of beef pho (yum!), bbq pork over rice (one plate shared between me and T) and some drip pot iced coffee (some argue its better than starbucks...don't know about that).  We then watched some DVDs.  Rhy, we watched season 3.  I forgot how good it is.  Went home, talked all night with husband and slept at about 2 am.  I'm trying to play around with my layout but have not been very successful to get the look I want.  I would pay for someone to change my layout so it looks unique. There's a job for somebody.  I've added some pics to test out.  I'll add more later.  See how 'photos' is so small?  I don't get how to make it the same size as the other ones.  I give up...I really don't know html.
