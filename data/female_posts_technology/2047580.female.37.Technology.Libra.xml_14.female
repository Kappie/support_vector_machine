Here's the latest, which I received from a reader of my  urlLink serious blog :  A woman walking in the woods sees a bottle, picks it and rubs it. Of course, a genie comes out (a three wish variety).  BUT what's different is that he's a chauvinist genie, so for each wish he grants the woman, her husband will get 10 times more than she receives.  The woman contemplates for a minute and decides that this is fine.  For her 1st wish, she asks to be the most beautiful woman in the world. Of course, the genie warns her that her husband will be 10 times more handsome! But, the woman is fine with that, so POOF!  2nd wish is to be the richest woman in the world, and yes she knows her husband will be 10 times richer but she's fine with that too......POOF!  For her 3rd and final wish, she asks for a MILD heart attack.   I know, that's kind of mean. But, that's how it goes with most jokes.
