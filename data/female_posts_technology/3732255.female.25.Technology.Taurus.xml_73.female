Also, seeing as how it seems to be a popular facet of the site at the moment, the infamous Frenzal Rhomb vs Austereo Network interview can still be found on the  urlLink black hole  page. If anyone has the chance to catch MediaWatch on the ABC next Monday August 2, please do as they are running a feature on Austereo and this whole sorry mess they've landed themselves in. Who knows, maybe I'll even put some new CD reviews up sometime for the bands who are touring. Which would probably mean me buying their CDs. Yeah, you might have to wait a bit for that one...
