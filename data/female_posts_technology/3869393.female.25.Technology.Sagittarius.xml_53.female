After 45 minutes of that, I began to feel like a person who is totally sick and hardly has anything left in her system!  Anyway, the purpose of the tests was to give the doctors some direction on whether the medication is having any effect on my system, and they sure did get an answer....absolutely no change in the parameters.....totally depressing!  Looks like my system is getting immune to the medication too...hahaha...well, anyway, the docs now have decided to up the medication strength and check if atleast then I show any improvement.  God only knows whats up with my system, mind and soul aint in sync, that I know, but then, for how long is it going to go on like this???  It's getting too depressing for me to handle!  These medications are supposed to make me better, but somehow show no effects in a positive sense really.  These idiotic medicines are now promoting a weight increase, high levels of nausea, dizziness, grrr, what more can a people who is emotional disturbed want to complete the emotional rollacoaster!!!!
