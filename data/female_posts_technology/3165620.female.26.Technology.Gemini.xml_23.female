Apparently, Mike wasn't aware that he is the best man! Buck swears that he told him months ago, but somehow Mike didn't remember. It's a good thing we have that cleared up before the wedding!  So, just in case there is any confusion, Mike Black is the best man and my sister Kirstin is my matron of honor. (I'll have to talk to her about what to wear the next time I get her on the phone.) We aren't planning on having any other attendants, so that should simplify some of the organization.
