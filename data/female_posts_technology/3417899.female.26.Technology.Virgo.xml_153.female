I have a  urlLink degenerated  disc and a  urlLink herniated  disc in my lumbar spine, with  urlLink siatica  (a pinched sciatic nerve) - causing constant pain in both my lower back and legs. I know, I know, I am a bit young to be complaining of such ailments, but such is life. (I've been considering  urlLink discectomy surgery  but am trying other alternatives for now).   Anyways, last night the pain became almost unbearable. Pills, stretching, ice - nothing helped. Then I remembered that my physical therapist had recommended that I exercise whenever the pain is strong. The aerobic exercise would cause the blood flow to the area to increase, thus helping to flush out the inflammation in the area and relieving the pain.  As much as I avoid exercising, I was willing to try anything - so I put on my sports bra and cute exercise outfit and headed to the gym.  The problem with lower back pain is, though, that many things aggravate it. Sitting, Walking or standing all put pressure on the lumbar area - causing the pain to increase. This pretty much rules out any aerobic exercise.  I looked longingly at the stationary bike (you know  urlLink  the type, with a comfortable backrest ?), my favorite machine, but opted instead for the elliptical trainer - where there would be less pressure on my back.  So as I was sweating through a one hour session, I thought of a wonderful exercise machine for people with pain like mine.  A  horizontal stationary bike .  People who suffer from back pain usually feel relief when laying on their backs. Furthermore, many of the exercises recommended for lower back-pain involve one laying on their back and moving their legs in a way that strengthens the lower abdominal and core muscles as well as the thighs. A "bicycling" motion, laying on your back. Simple, ingenious, healthy. Get your aerobic exercise and stay on your back too.  Another invention for my drawer.
