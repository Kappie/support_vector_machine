Last night was Buffy's super final episode.  Sniff, sniff.  Anya died.  Spike died.  Angel showed up and gave me more hope that eventually Buffy and him will still end up together.  Thank you for entertainment like this that makes me forget my money problem.  If you want a blow-by-blow recap of some of your favorite shows including Alias, go and visit  Television Without Pity . It's right up there on my links section.
