Got a bad stinker from one of the clients and had another breathing fire down my throat. Was a very different situation to work in. Not that my recruiters were firing all guns, hardly even remotely close to that. It's almost as though everyone at office had gone into snooze mode. I was in aworld of my own, trying to work my way thro' some quality issues which have been pending overtime. Had a long chat with my australian  singaporein counterpart today and got an insight into myself, kindof forced them to do a little bit of an analysis on me. Was quite an interesting process as they said some stuff about me which made me sit up and wonder, hmmm, not bad, I have left an impression on ppl..;)  Anyways, as the day rolled by, my past began to dance infront of me over and over again. Was having a tough time controlling my thought process. Everytime I waivered, I had to literally knock some sense into myself, kindof like a jolt of reality and come down to earth. Must say, a pretty painful process considering the amount of force I had to exert onto myself to block my thoughts.  As office drew to a close, I began typing my previous days' blog on my sunday trip to Knachipuram. Was a nice trip, pretty nostalgic. Dad came to pick me up, was nice having a daugther and father chat after a long time really. Discussed my mental framework and current situation, how to make the best of what I have left and what I can make for my future. Painful thoughts as I had to accept certain things, my negativity which I had been blocking for months together began to come to the fore front and I was kindof hanging on to a thread which was slowly giving way. I was beginning to exhibit signs of loneliness,unhappiness, digust, pain, anger, frustration and every ther negative emotions which a human can feel. This was just not me, but this pain and misery was beginnng to take a toll on me. I need to work my way out of this, but I dont know how to. I think what I really need a tthe moment is some sound sleep, one of the many things I have lost oflate.   Here's hoping for a peaceful night of sleep and hopefully a better day tomorrow!
