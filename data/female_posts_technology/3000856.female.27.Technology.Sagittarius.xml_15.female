Went and saw Melissa and the kids for a bit today. Her and I have been friends for 17 yrs! We don't get to see eachother often, but we are always there for each other.  We have very different life styles, but we are still good friends.  I get to get up and face another wonderful day at work tomorrow.  Still looking for jobs and houses and no luck in either dept right now.  My luck of course! Can't wait to practice again.  I want to nail these songs!  I work on them a little by myself, but it is not the same as practicing w/ the band. Plus I love the atmosphere when practicing, it makes me feel really good. I guess that is why I love it so much. Need to get back to the family.
