(Interpol) *Paul Banks (Interpol) *Fabrizio Moretti (Strokes)  If any of these boys showed up at my work to whisk me across the Bay Bridge, that would  surely  make XX seethe with jealousy and regret. He would hate himself so much that he'd punch himself in the face and in deep-seated sadness his organ would remain permanently flaccid (insert wilting-flower-slide-whistle-sound-effect here). While boy-from-boy-list and I drove across the bridge the sun would sink lazily, casting its golden spread over our new love and rockin music would blast from heaven.  Also the new boy at work randomly asked me about my last name. I said, "Oh 'Apple' is a hybridized bastardized Vietnamese name. I'm Vietnamese but don't ask me to speak it because I'll only embarrass myself AND you." Turns out he's half-Vietnamese. Huh. I thought he was Filipino. Huh. That's what people usually think  I  am. Huh. He's probably in love with me. He will have to dump his girlfriend then for this Grade A snatch.  "Boys, boys, PLEASE. Get in LINe! There's a little slice of Apple for alla youse!"  (My awesome attitude comes from this exciting combo: I look especially awesome today, and XX came up to talk to me and he looked like absolute hell.  urlLink Schadenfreude !)
