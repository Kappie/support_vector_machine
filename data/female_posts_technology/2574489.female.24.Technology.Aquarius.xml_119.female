I answer calls from customers and try to troubleshoot their problems with our software or website.  Sometimes, the problem is that the caller should not own a computer. =)   2. What do you like most about your job?    The people I work with. I've met some really cool people there! The fact that I got to take a job that has something to do with my degree instead of the collections job I thought I would have to take (twas a bad time economically when I graduated).  The pay is pretty good.  My managers are great! My schedule. Our location.    Yes, lemme remember these good things so I won't focus so much on the bad.   3. What do you like least about your job?    Our rush season (before school starts) is absolute hell!  I also hate prissy customers, and customers who should have stuck with a typewriter.    4. When you have a bad day at work it's usually because _____...    A caller tries to make me feel stupid by saying I must not know a lot about networks.  Uh, yeah, I know a lot, but I'm not gonna help you reset passwords when I don't have a clue as to who you are! And what the hell are you doing with access to the server if you don't know how to manage it?  I also hate it when I get things wrong.     5. What other career(s) are you interested in?    I want to be a professor, I'm not sure of what though.  I also want to be technical trainer (fly out to teach people on a new software and such). Or teach computers at a private high school or community college.  Anything to get off the phones!
