The learning Bible was little help here, just sending me all over the place to read other verses in other parts of the Bible that were supposed to be similar. But, I think it's fairly easy to get the general gist of the passage, even if some of the language doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  Basically, God doesn't like gossips, people who talk badly about other people, who spread rumors or lies, are deceitful, or who cause rifts between people.  Without gossip, an argument won't have as much fuel to continue.  But people who enjoy causing arguments, who enjoy spreading gossip, add fuel to the fire.  Their words get taken to heart, and can be very damaging to those listening, and to the person spreading the gossip too.  They may try to cover up what they're doing with a fake smile and throwing in occasional compliments, to make it sound like they aren't really saying or doing anything wrong, but they are being deceitful.  Eventually, it will come back to bite him, though.  They will be exposed for what they are doing, and whatever they have done will come back and be done to them.  People who lie and spread rumors hate the people they are hurting, and covering up what they are doing by acting all nice about it just makes it worse.  I have known so many people who were like this.  Trish is like this.  She will spread lies and rumors about people she doesn't like, and do it in a way that makes it seem so harmless, like she's just repeating something she heard or whatever.  I really can't stand that aspect of her, she used to do it at Armstrong all the time, and she still does it.  That's beside the point, though.  God doesn't like people who do this, so we should be really careful about what we say, pay attention to whether things we say can hurt someone, and be careful not to spread gossip or perpetuate rumors others may have started.  I'm glad I'm over the whole gossip thing, but I still need to be careful about it.
