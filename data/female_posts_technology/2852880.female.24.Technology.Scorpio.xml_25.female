Now I am one with the water.  Sometimes I stick a washcloth at the bottom of the sink to muffle the sound.  But when that becomes saturated with water, then the dripping starts again.  This time it's the water dripping down the drain.  It's amazing how loud dripping water can be.  Maybe an acoustician will explain it to me someday.
