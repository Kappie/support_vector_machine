He(Guy) asked for my number and said maybe we could go out if he visited Manila. I said, sure, once he got his college degree(he dropped out) and passed the board exams.   diva: alam mo ba diva: nagtext sa kin yung guy sa boracay diva: yung sa pier sade: HAHAHA sade: kamusta daw? sade: baket ka tinext daw? nasa manila? diva: gusto mo malaman kung baket? sade: yep sade: baket? diva: HINAHANAP ANG KAGANDAHAN MO DAAAY!! diva: grabe ka talaga sis! diva: hehehe sade: hahahahahaha sade: natawa naman ako dun sade: pano sinabi? diva: anong ginawa mo dun at naloloko yata sa beauty mo diva: nangangamusta lang sade: hahahaha sira diva: tapos tinatanong # mo sade: aaa sade: e di bigay mo sade: number ko dito :-D  (take note: I am in the US right now)  diva: sige sige sade: hahaha joke lang diva: anong # mo dyan? diva: bibigay ko talaga diva: para di naman ako nahihirapan diva: hahaha diva: na-inggit daw diva: hahaha sade: hahahaha sade: e ngekngek  sade: sabihin mo sabi ko dapat may trabaho na sya dito sa manila pag nagtext sya sa akin noh sade: :-P sade: ask mo kung meron na syang work sa manila diva: wala diva: balik probinsya daw sya diva: para mag-aral yata diva: or something diva: di ko na pinansin kasi ikaw naman ang sadya at di ako diva: hahaha diva: :-) sade: hahaha sade: bitter :-P diva: hahaha  My point is --- I didn't know that encouraging words, and a challenge, had such a strong effect. I thought it was just some random guy, and that we'd never hear from him again. I'm glad he's continuing his studies. I know I was not the only reason he continued his studies, but I'm glad to have helped contribute to his decision (I'm assuming a lil arrogantly that I did  haha ).  Note: I really am not interested in anything he has to offer right now. I love who I'm with. It was just one of those instances that make you believe you have a hand in the way the world works and moves.  But, then again, not really.
