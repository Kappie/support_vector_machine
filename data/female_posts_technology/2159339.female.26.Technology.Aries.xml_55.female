In an exercise to be less lustful, and more innocent, cute, and harmless, I resolve to write about innocuous funny interactions that occur within my office. In the office there is this one guy -let's call him Alan- that I don't talk to that much, except twice. Both times, he was funny. Here's what made me chuckle:  1. Before I enter a cube to distribute supplies, I whisper, "Knock, Knock...." Before I entered Alan's cube, I said "Knock, Knock" and he whispered back, "Who's there?"   2. I'm filling my cup with water in the kitchen and he's trying to use the espresso machine. Clouds of steam and screechy whistling noises are coming from it. I deadpan, "It's going to explode" and without missing a beat, he says back, "...or rocket to the moon!"
