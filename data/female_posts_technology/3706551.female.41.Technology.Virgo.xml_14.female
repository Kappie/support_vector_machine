There is some shit in that book that I'm not willing to wrap my brain around, girls. Here's a quote from pg. xxii: "And at the end of the day .... roll over in bed, close your eyes, give him a big hug, AND REMEBER THAT WITHOUT HIM, YOU ARE ONLY A SORRY EXCUSE FOR A PERSON [empahasis mine], but as half of the team, you are invincible."   Give me a FUCKING break! No one is a sorry excuse for a person just because they are not hooked up with somebody else in a relationship. This is FUCKING LUDICROUS! In fact, I believe that you better be happy on your own before you can successfully hook up with someone else in any kind of long term relationship. If you don't enjoy your own company, how can you expect anyone else to either. Dr. Laura says some other shit that will blow your mind too. You should read Chapter 6 "What's Sex?" Here's a quote from pg. 133: CALLER: "Should I be expected to have sex when I don't want to just because he wants to?" DR LAURA: "Most of the time, yes. .... It's called loving obligation."   No wonder women don't want to be married to men. Why are families going to hell in a handbasket? Read this book  you'll find out.    urlLink Here  is how another chick feels about Dr. Laura ... read it, it's funny!
