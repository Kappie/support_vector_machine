The heavy raining had stopped for a moment, but there were no street lights on and as far as we could see, every single house was dark. I opened the gate and the front door of our apartment building like a seasoned blindman, but once we got inside and closed the door behind us, thick opaque blackness blinded us. Like an idiot, I was thinking, "Oh, I'll just feel along the wall a couple of steps, then turn the garage light on, so we can see our way up the stairs!" I'm such a dunce.  Dizzy D took charge and said, "Grab a hold of my arm!" He used his umbrella as a blind man's cane and tapped his way, side to side, down the lobby hallway til we got to the bottom of the stairs. The darkness was suffocating in its intangible and infinite vastness, so the light rhythmic clicking of his umbrella made me giggle in relief. If in the land of a blackout, the man with an umbrella is king, then his ex-girlfriend -clinging to his arm like a newborn marsupial- would have to be the jester.  On Sunday, he helped me move my furniture down to the van and I helped him look online for potential new girlfriends. This is the "Euro" part I was referring to earlier. I feel comfortable enough with our break-up that I'm actively encouraging him to move on and start seeing people, while he feels comfortable enough with my modern-thinking/ downright weirdness that he will let me be his matchmaker. So far, I've approved five online ladies that may do him right. We spent our penultimate night together, excitedly talking about our new lives and bright futures, while chowing down on beef taquitos and mini-tacos washed down with cold beer.    On the XX front, unrelatedly, I have a feeling that our mutual infatuations with each other are starting to diminish. My libido tells me so. When I put my ear close to my vagina, it says to me, "Girl, you best not take up widdiss wigga. You gotta do some of yo art, make some yo punk-ass songs, be yo weird-ass sef again. Hear? Pay NO mind to me... I won't pay yo bills or mek you a star... That's in yo brains and fo yo hands. Now get yo head from out between yo legs and do somethin real! For real now." Word.
