Curious, he says to the girl, "What's in the basket?"      She replies, "New baby kittens" and opens the basket to show him.      "How nice," he said.       "What kind are they?" Little girl says, "Republicans."      He smiles and pats the little girl on the head and he continues on.      About three weeks later, he and another member of the Senate staff are again strolling on Capitol Hill when he sees the little girl again with the same basket. He says to his colleague; "Watch this, it's very cute" and they approach the little girl.      He asks the girl how the kittens are and she says fine. He then says, "What kind of kittens are they?" and she replies, "Democrats."      Somewhat abashed, he says, "Three weeks ago you said they were Republican!"      "I know," she says. "But now their eyes are open".
