I do like a inbuilt calculator and little fields that add things up for you.  However, while I feel that life is generally interesting, two things which immediately make my eyes glaze over and wishing that my brain had a secret door to Narnia are superannuation and tax.  I've probably miscalculated all sorts of things and am sure that I'm missing some crucial deduction which could result in a larger refund, but honestly I could care less. It's over for another year and I can cross that hideous chore off my list.  The wardrobe has been done too.  Fortunately, a small disagreement with my mother spurred me onto throw an enormous stuff away, four garbage bags worth.  We always have words when it comes to my blase attitude to consumerism. But you can't blame any post-war immigrant for their attitudes to money.   Count them people, four!   That's terrible, isn't it? To think that I haven't worn four huge bags of clothing, shoes and accessories for more than a year (that was the criteria - it's in all the magazines) made me feel a number of things, ie. I have hideous taste, I have no idea about what to buy, I'm a complete spendthrift who should go and live in a monastery for five years and learn the true value of money.  But I think it's mainly that my whole fashion experience has been shaped by the fact that I have lived within 10 minutes of a Kmart my whole life.
