So I was a little influenced by that comment when I watched the movie yesterday night at GV Plaza.   Well, it is interesting to use the weather as the basic of the story. However, among the disaster movies such as Deep Impact, Armaggadon, The Core, this one has become so expected. There's always a dog involved, a divorced family (to protray the American culture?), a president, a bad guy who learned his mistakes, foolish people who dont heed advices, a young hero who save his love and they kiss and make out, an older expert sacrificing.. and so on. Plot is too predictable. Special effects are not bad, but not good enough. I'd wish they will focus more on the greatness of the disaster, and protray the fear and how scary they are. I didn't feel anything. There some climaxes but it didn't get me too excited. Really, if its a story about the weather, show more of the hurricanes, storms and tsunamis, how they form, why and how scary they can be. Instead, they could only manage computer simulation used by the meteorologist.   Either acting isn't too convincing or the director fail to deliver the emotions. This deserves 2/5 stars.
