(i got a couple of really cute outfits for naoko - my little japanese character)... the great thing about this game is that you can totally suck ass but still get platinum record status... woohoo! but expert level is super hard. even on the easy songs. bastards.  at any rate, steve just told me at lunch that Monkey hated my singing cuz she ran into the home today and ripped the cord apart for the headset. damn. now i have to go and buy another mic. thank god for amazon.  damn that bunny. she's so cute, but so, so bad. sheesh. oh well. i was gonna get a different mic, anyway.
