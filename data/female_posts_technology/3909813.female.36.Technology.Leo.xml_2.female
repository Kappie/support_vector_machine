It started last Monday.  My daughter starts tomorrow.  I am amazed by the day, and how quickly it passed.  How quickly the last 10 years have passed, it shocks me really.  It seems to be a blur, and I am sooo set that I will not let the next 10 years be a blur.  I want to make them matter.  The last 10 did matter, but I feel I wasted so much time.  Enough for now.   I am tired of feeling so "old school."  I want to be more than that.  BLah.  I am amazed that how quickly time has passed and the 80s are now on cable and considered old.  So are the 90s actually.  I guess that whatupsets me the most is that I feel old.  I am not, I mean really that old.  But I just well, I dunno.    In sooo many ways I am so much closer to ever figuring out who and what I am, but in sooo many other ways, I seem to have lost all of the people in my life I thought were family/friends, etc.  They really were not good for me.  I now have a handful of people in my life that I can count on and I feel very lucky to have that, but I am just trying to figure out why and what I want to do with the next 30 years.    Happy Birthday Sweet Girl>  Make this year count.
