There were a few "ah" spots and I love the exposition at the end. Won't tell you much here so that it gives it away - like 6th Sense. I will say that Adrien Brody plays a great nutcase in this one. Oh yeah, when Joaquin Phoenix goes off - almost every girl would like to hear that one day and yes, He had her at hello - smart ass (you know who you are! :P )  Thurs night:  urlLink Little Black Book . Curiosity didn't kill the cat in this movie but did kill the current relationship. Cute-type story line and it doesn't hurt that Ron Livingston is in the movie either. The girl doesn't get the guy in the end. It's sad but ya know that isn't such a bad thing sometimes either. One can do all right without a boyfriend or lover in one's life. Brittany Murphy doesn't do so badly in this one. Her character was pretty good. More entertaining was the famous person that shows up in the end. Commitment can be scary from a guy's point of view or so the movie let us see.   Remember "Kippy Kan Do!!"  Fri night:  urlLink Anchorman . Of course the humor was loaded thru and thru this movie. Had no idea the following folks were going to be in it at all: Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, and Christina Applegate. She looks great! Ben actually didn't look so bad either. Vince well he's still very very tall. 70's stuff threaded in the movie like no one's business. Helps make it a ton of laughs. Never knew that an Anchoman's job was so tough. lol  Sun night:  urlLink Kumar  Harold/White Castle . OMG! Talk about teenage humor. It's "caked" with crazy pre-college hijinks. I completely understand their drive to get food satisfaction and have nothing butt distractions. Power to the oppressed kid!  Movie to wait for  urlLink Blade 3  - Dec 22nd.  Have a quiet time at the movies!  Question o'rama: How many alternate online or life personalities do you have?
