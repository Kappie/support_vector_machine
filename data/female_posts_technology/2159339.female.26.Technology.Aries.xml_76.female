I also spent about 30 minutes earlier looking for another job - preferably something not in an office building. Or perhaps on the first floor, where the cafes and restaurants and card shops are. This job was going well until my boss went psycho and blamed me for mistakes I didn't make. Because I'm the first one to admit when I do something wrong but this time I didn't and I refuse to feel intimidated by her 300 pound 6 foot frame. So I've been furious all day. Yesterday too, actually. So pissed off that I decided that I will skip the holiday party since I might quit/get fired anyway. Better tell M so he can make other plans. Ha!  Good news of the day (besides going to see Bart Davenport, # 1 object of my affection) - James is back from New York. Will write more about that later. Batty - you met James at K's high tea birthday extravaganza. I know! So exciting!!
