The only thing I ate different from two other people who were with me Friday night and Saturday all day were  urlLink Whattaburger  taquitos.  I had the bacon.  The other thing I ate different was this minestrone soup, except by the time I ate it, my intestines were already doing little jigs in my stomach.    I'm very much afraid that the cause of my stomach troubles were the clover chips, the other item no one but me has touched. :(  I was reading the ingredients, and they don't look so benign and I'm wondering whether the air had some bad reaction with any one of this scientific sounding ingredients.  Today I won't eat anything (I don't think my stomach can take it), I called in sick.  My boss kinda put a guilt trip on me saying that another one of my co-worker called in sick.  I told him if I feel better I'd come in.  If my stomach settles, I will.  But I have taken: Mylanta, gasX, tums, and I still haven't felt any better.  ***   What was good about the weekend: Seeing another wedding, making it to workout at least one of the day, found another good chinese restaurant to which I must return to because I wasn't feeling too good when I went there and only had rice and soup.  I also cuddled lazily with hubby all Sunday, except for a quick trip to B to browse books.  We finished CSI season 1 Disc 4, The Count of Monte Cristo, and the 25th Hour.  What was bad about the weekend: Getting violently ill. Tuning in to KERA to watch British Comedies and only catching their fund-raising portion. Hubby spending two hours trying to cook pork chops the way my dad cooks pork chops and it turning out inedible.  Hubby stubbing his toes twice the same day (maybe this should be moved to the first list just for its comedic effect).
