Dinner - 1/2 chicken dinner with veggies from Swiss Chalet (aka, the Hauer Special) ;) Snack - raspberry yogurt smoothey  Exercise - 2 baseball games. And.... *drum roll*.... I got my double!!! The guys in our league play girls shallow, so I smacked it over the outfielder's head and took off... I knew I was going to make second base before I even rounded first, because I was hustling. As a matter of fact, I spent a lot of time running the bases because I went 4 for 6 with 2 walks (Yay!), but I also think that I ran a lot better than I have all year... proof positive that something is working here. At first I though "I'm having frenchfries to celebrate, man!" but instead, I found its motivated me to stick with the plan. :)
