I disagreed vehemently to his statement because I'm essentially a wide-eyed closet romantic and optimist, but I'm starting to understand the crux of his argument. Maybe my recent experiences have infused me with cynicism, but I don't believe there are soul mates, only mates of convenience.   If soul mates truly existed and we search for them, then more people would be single and the earth less populated. And look at all the people who marry and look into each others' eyes and utter their undying devotion to each other, then get divorced a year later. Perhaps the state of soul mate-dom is fleeting and temporary. Whereas mates of convenience would explain why I've had four boyfriends already, most of them friends that've turned into lovers. It's the convenience. Three of them were co-workers that I'd worked with a long while before we got together. It's the convenience. It's the proximity and the ease of making plans because we speak the same language,  live within the same city, and have the same schedule. What is love between a man and a woman, really, except sex and companionship? And when that gets tired, what are we left with?
