'get out of my way before i chagall your ass'..it was fun.   oh! and it's my half birthday today. woo hoo! 25.5. will celebrate by purchasing fabric at britex and trying to catch up with the rest of my sewing class. if sucessful, will treat self to ethiopian food. if unsucessful, will treat self to ethiopian food.
