I created this partly from curiosity, but mostly because my teenage daughter has been pestering me to create one.  She created one on a site that does web journals only, but I, being the Google-geek that I am, had to use Google's.  Besides that, I use the Google toolbar anyway.  I am not sure what prompted the current Blog craze, but I have to think that it is a good thing.
