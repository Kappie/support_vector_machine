And although I'm not a match.com account holder, I was bored enough to give them a try.    The first test is all about physical attraction - and let me tell you, this HAS to be science...  Apparently, I'm attracted to "handsome men over 30" and those who are "clean shaven, have clear skin, and get good hair cuts."  And here I've been looking for some hideously deformed 24 year-old with stubbly, acne-ridden skin and dreads...  The other is a "personal attraction" test -- more of a personality assessment.  In addition to identifying my dazzling personality, my report went on to say: "You're a strong, honest, and deeply loyal woman. In a crisis, you're the one co-workers and friends come to for help. They know you'll give them straightforward, common sense advice. You can always be counted on to do what you say and say what you mean. You take pride in your work. In fact, at times this part of your life has pushed romance and fun to the "back burner." But you're not one to "settle" and so constantly strive to find balance in your life. You're not someone who "wears her heart on her sleeve" so even those closest to you don't always know how you feel. When someone special in your life invests the time to get to know you on a deeper level, they'll discover the more sensual and warm parts of your personality."  OK - I'm a workaholic who comes off as an ice queen...  Fair enough.   Other "highlights" of my report: "The organization and time-management skills that serve you so well in your career can spill over into your personal life and at times make you seem controlling and impatient."  "You're such a straightforward and honest woman that at times what you say comes across a little harsh and insensitive." Ouch.  Talk about harsh...  But overall, I have to admit that's not far off.  Although "at times" should be better defined.  Maybe "under extreme distress"...  Surprisingly enough, a whopping 4% of men are "very attracted" to my personality type.  Probably those who prefer to keep their women in a pit.  :)
