Oh, and by the way Greenlee, you were a hottie as a blond. And those upper arm muscles? Yum, yum. Please, please come out of the closet for good and start getting into bar brawls and catfights with Lena and/or Anna.)  Boyd will be referred to as “Boy” (even though he is a bigger girl than I am.) Except for when he is wearing pink. Then he will be referred to as “lip liner-Boy”.  Lena will be referred to as “mine”. (Except when she is being forced to chew extra large chunks of scenery, then she will be referred to as “wasted in this gauze covered lens piece of excrement”)   Maggie will be referred to as “the not gay yet Mary Stuart Masterson” (or in a particularly poorly written scene with absolutely no character continuity “the tard friend”)  Aiden will be referred to as “lip liner Boy’s boyfriend” (and who exactly decided it was a good idea for Aiden to stop taking his medication anyway? Man, he is seriously way off his leash.)  Kendall will be referred to as “bipolar Sybil”     Anna is a bigger lesbian than Bianca. And what the hell is she doing with David?! She rolls her eyes and grimaces every time she sees him, plus he is a big twat.   David will be referred to as “that big twat”  Lena, forget about Bianca. There is no way in hell it was that good, plus, have you  met  her family? Jesus wept the baggage alone should scream “run! run away!” Look, Anna would be perfect for you. She obviously hates men (if her treatment of David, Aiden etc. is any indication) and she’s one surly (yet ineffective) chief of police.   Opal will be referred to as “the coke whore”  Mary Polanski? What a great name! Mary is supposed to be evil but she is really just a rich snob and therefore evil lite. Wait a minute, Cruella De Vil and Dr. Evil were rich snobs too and that didn’t slow them down. But she does list from side to side when she walks and is rarely without a fancy pants adult beverage so maybe her standing as evil will rise eventually.     Ok, let me get this straight (I said straight, teehee.): Jackson is Greenlee’s dad, Reggie’s dad and Bianca’s uncle. Erica is Bianca’s mom, Kendall’s mom and Jackson’s sister in law. If Jackson ever actually marries Erica (which won’t happen for at least 3 more sweeps from now-trust me, they are going to drag out the Bianca preggers slash where in the world is Michael Cambais etc. ad nausea) then that would make him: Greenlee and Reggie’s dad, Kendall’s step father and Bianca’s uncle-daddy! (or would that be daddy-uncle?) All my children my ass, this is all my incestual, anorexic neuroses.   What’s with all the gauze over the camera? I suppose I would understand if certain, geriatric actors only appeared under gauze but that is not the case. These people use gauze without any rhyme or reason. Or are they following some secret math vs. actor personality rule we aren’t privileged to? Do the camera operators go, “Ok yesterday Anna gave me 4 front row tickets to Cats and Boyd gave me cooties. And today the 2 of them are appearing in a scene with Huey Lewis and Jackson. Jackson is so sweet but dumber than a box of rocks and Huey and I go to the same ice skating rink but he only speaks to me when he is hopped up on crack. All 4 of them look like hell, so how about some gauze! Yeah gauze! Let’s use 4 layers instead of the usual 2.” Humph! Math is hard.        There are simply not enough slap fights and hair pulling on this show. Sure, every once in a while the gals of Fusion decide to go out for margaritas, get drunk and start slinging glasses. But with Kendall weighing in as the giant of the group at 58 pounds (as opposed to the 42 to 44 pounds the rest of them weigh), it’s a wonder any of them can hold up their rock filled, squeak toy heads much less throw an effective punch! The effort it would take to pull a blouse hard enough to get the buttons to pop off? Forget about it.
