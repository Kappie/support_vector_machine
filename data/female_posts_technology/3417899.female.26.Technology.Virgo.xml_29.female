With typically Israeli caution, my boss answers "California".  "No, I mean that language yu were speaking, where is it from?".  "Oh" we say "It's Hebrew. We're form Israel" "Are you Christian?", he asks.  "No, we're Jewish" we say.  "I thought you said you were Hebrew" he says "Hebrew is the language, Jewish is the religion." "And so what is Israel?" "That's the country".  "Oh..." (confused slience).   "So can you be from Israel and not be Jewish" "yes" "Can you be Jewish and not speak Hebrew" "yes" "Can you be from Israel and not be Jewish" "yes"  So who are the Hebrews?   We pull up to the office and the quetsion is left hanging. And I wish I could have stayed longer to explain the intricacies of the unique nationality, heritage and religion web that defines us.
