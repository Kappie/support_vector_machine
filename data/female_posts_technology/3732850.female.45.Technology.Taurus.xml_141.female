To examine every word on paper is hard.He states "her personal physician" to be "her doctor."Zinsser mentionsclutter being the enemy in any form. He mentionsstarting out clutter is like fighting weeds. This will smother what you write. He quotes many exampleslike invasion a "reinforced protective reaction strike."The quote, "This will interest you"? is more likely todistract the readers attention finding it dull. The writer is speaking of unnecessary words and ends with the last sentance, "Simplify, simplify." Zinsser uses repitition throughout his essay. One example is, "It's raining." The weathermansays, "At the present time we are experiencing precipition. This is unnecessary jargon. His essay points this out clearly with his many examples. I found this essay hilarious. I liked how he stated his examples from long sentances to one word. I enjoyed the words we eliminated last week. His last sentance I found to be powerful with the word simplify. He used one word instead of saying, "Cut your Clutter."
