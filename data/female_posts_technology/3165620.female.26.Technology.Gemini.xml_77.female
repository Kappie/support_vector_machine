He asked if I wanted to go swimming, told me not to be scared (yeah, that always reassures people!), and said  he had enjoyed watching me . That last bit is what freaked me out enough to call the police. Of course, he was gone by the time they arrived. I had my fiance come over and stay to make me feel safe enough to sleep.  I'm not sure which is a creepier thought, that this nut might have been peeking past my bedroom blinds and watching me in some state of undress, or that he enjoyed watching me sit on the couch in my living room watching late-night television. Either thought is quite disturbing. I think I'll be keeping my blinds shut at night now.  I'm wondering where this guy came from. Does he live in my complex? Would I recognize him if I saw him in the mailroom? What would I do if I did?   *sigh*  It's a strange world. I suppose that after enough time goes by, this will become one of those odd stories you tell at parties, but for now, I'm still a bit on edge.
