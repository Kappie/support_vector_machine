On the way to the airport at 6:30 on Saturday morning we were cracking jokes (mostly about my hair) like we always do and then later that day I dialed his number to see if he wanted to go look for a Dreamweaver book with me and before I heard the ring I realized that he can't because he's in NY. At least I don't care as much as mom - I went to visit Oscar yesterday and we walked into G's room and she pretty much broke down. I was like "What the fuck Natali! Stop that shit." And she said "Oh, you don't understand anything. I couldn't walk into your room for two months after you left for Japan". And I realized oh lordy, I better visit them often so that she doesn't got crazy.  On the bright side, went to a much anticipated brunch at Kate's Kitchen with my favorite peeps and bought some brown sparkly Dorothy-type shoes at Shoe Biz on Sunday. I'm wearing them today and they hurt like hell. The little sparklies keep rubbing against my foot until I bleed, but what the hey. Maybe I can wear them as other types of accessories, like pins or ends of a scarf or something.  This day is promising to be laaaame (a random man in the elevator told me this this morning) but at least I found interesting jobs to apply for and my little radio gets decent reception. Carry on, gentle readers, and I will too.  (P.S. The receptionist just laughed out loud at my funny walk (due to shoe pain) and offered band-aids, which I gladly accepted.)
