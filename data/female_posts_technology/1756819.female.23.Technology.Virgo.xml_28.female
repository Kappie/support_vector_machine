I mean, I feel like I'm still in my late teens.  I can totally understand how people feel as they get old and they're bodies start breaking down, yet they feel 20-something or 30-something inside.  Must be incredibly frustrating.  On another note, I feel like myself again today.  Yesterday my roomie "straightened" my hair.  I have reasonably curly hair and I say "straightened" because my hair really didn't turn out straight.  More frizzy than straight.  Though I am not surprised, I am a little disappointed.  It would be nice to have truly straight hair for a day.  But my so called straight hair did not feel or look right to me.   It felt coarse and dry and frizzy.  Not to mention the fact that my hair was probably rebelling against me for torturing it so.  So this morning when I was getting ready for work I was really nice to my hair and let it curl the way it wanted to.  Now my hair is happier, and so am I.
