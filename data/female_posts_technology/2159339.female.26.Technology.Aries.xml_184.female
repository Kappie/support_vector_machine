They let me open my presents yesterday, reasoning I was already born by that time back in the motherland. And why else? Because they got me an awecome hand made belt (Thanks Green Marble!) and some hot peach Franco Sartos which I practically fell asleep in (Thank you Batty Apple!!). They effing rock. And Batty, I'm wearing the earrings. I'm such a lucky girl.
