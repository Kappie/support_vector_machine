Like a broadway play continuously revived;  the curtain opens, the world is seated Neoteric players extract age old conclusions  ad finitum  and so. on and on;  cause and effect -  effect and cause until  each is indistinguishable  from the last  proverbial. stone for stone;  Eye for Eye -  For Us. Against Us. Collective memory just died.  Vietnam, Korea, Jerusalem, Belfast Falluja, Rafah, Abu Ghraib  rewind.  The past becomes the present The future mere doubt; With each perishing soul  iwantout.
