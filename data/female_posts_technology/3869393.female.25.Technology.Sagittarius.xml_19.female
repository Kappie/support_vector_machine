As usual, I had to fight for the computer, but then for a change I lost the fight this time around. Hmm...wonder if this is a new trend...hope not!  So what was my sunday like, well, I guess this is how my sunday's are probably going to be spent by me for a few more months...haha!  Woke up at 6am, and had to wash my hair...couldnt wash it on saturday coz it was amavasya, sooooo many rules!!! Anyway, once that ordeal was over, I had to rush and get ready for our temple trip. This weekend wasmore focussed on temples around Chennai. Todays' trip was to Kanchipuram. Quite a nice place, known as the temple town, it kindof lost a lot of its shine as the temple town and is now the official saree capital!   But then, the temples are still among the best and most beautiful ones. First, in the series of temples was at this place called Tirupakozhi. This is a very nostalgic temple for my family as this is the place where my maternal grandma came over, offered some prayers and after which my uncle was concieved. Infact my uncle is named after this temple deity, Vijayaraghavan. This particular temple has a tradition where women who are unable to concieve, take a dip in the tank at the temple premises, collect some green gram, roast it and then bundle it in a moist muslin cloth and have it placed on their tummy and knotted up. As normal scientific knowledge would say, once roasted, the pulse should not sprout, but as per the tradition here, this pulse will sprout if the woman is blessed by the deity, Managathavalli Thaiyar. Quite strange as it sounds, but since I have seen a few cases comes thro with this, I dont have much choice but to believe in the same.  Next stop was a temple called Yadotkara. This is a strange temple, coz it has a lot of relation with a temple down south near Kumbakonam. The lord is supposed to have got angry at one of the kings and come to this place. Here he grants his devotee a set of wishes, so the lord here is called Sunna Vannukm Perumal. Amazing Andal here, really quite gorgeous a deity.  Next Stop was at this place within Kanchipuram, called Tupur, this is the place where Vendanta Desikar is supposed to have been born and initiated his religious discourse. Yet, another beautiful temple with an amazing explaination. Here is the place where I learnt the meaning of Kanchi puram - Bhrama's home, and the meaning of Rameshwaram - meeting place of rama and Shiva, and the meaning of Kasi - the meeting of Light and Bhrama.  We were to close the trip with a stop at Varadaraja Temple, but courtesy of some guy jumping into the temple tank, the temple doors were being closed as we entered the temple. Anyway, this temple I guess wasnt in our agenda for the trip, so no problem, will be visited in the next round.  Then came lunch at 13:30, was feeling too full and droggy, think the medication which Iwas on was taking effect. So, just had a milkshake and tried to settle my stomach. The weather was quite bad yday and our drive back was made miserable with the innumerable broken and patched roads.  Once I reached home, it had to be rest and relaxation time. So, ola, DVD time. This evening, it was a movie called " save the last dance ". I think I am hooked to movies which revolve around dance and music. I think my interest in dance is on the up and probably I need to join back my dance classes and add some spice or shall I say salsa/ jiveto my life. Nice movie, since I enjoyed the music, dance and ofcourse the story was built up decently.  Later in the evening, it was off to the club, where to my surprise I got to watch the cricket match on a giant screen. Yeah, the match was lousy and I guess was lost in the first few overs of India's innings. Got back home by 10, and hit the bed...wasnt feeling too well..think all the medication is now starting to go ahead of me..and drain me out...anyway, here's hoping my stomach gets to normality soon. Its quite a pain to lose one's appetite especially when you love food.
