DOMESTIC STABBING: A woman was arrested Monday morning after reportedly stabbing her boyfriend in the arm during a domestic dispute at a Stratford apartment.  Amy Sciuto, 23, of Huntington Road, Stratford, was charged with disorderly conduct, second-degree assault, first-degree reckless endangerment, risk of injury to a minor and several drug charges.  Stratford officers were summoned to Waterbury Hospital on reports Sciuto had stabbed her 26-year-old live-in boyfriend in the arm.  When police went to interview Sciuto at her home, she initially denied the allegation, claiming he had cut himself. She later told officers she tried to hit the victim, but he struck first. They then rolled around on the kitchen floor, police said.  During a search of the apartment, officers found a bloody towel in the laundry room, reports said. Police said a small amount of marijuana was found in Sciuto's purse. Sciuto was held in lieu of $100,000 bond for an appearance in Bridgeport Superior Court.
