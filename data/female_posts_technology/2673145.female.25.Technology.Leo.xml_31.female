(So cheesy.. hahaha)  The Troy, a great movie with gorgeous men. I spoilt the enjoyment of the movie because I was too distracted by Brad Pitt and his beautiful body. Fantastic fight scenes and interesting story. Director did an excellent job in telling the story on screens. Sadly, I've nothing more to say about this movie other then Brad and Eric Bana (totally dig his body.. *drool*). Orlando? Well, he acted well, so much so that I don't want to remember him as Prince Paris. He shall remain as the swift Legolas.   I should watch the movie again, and this time, pay attention to the show. I still can't forget his naked body.. sigh..   And what is wrong with the movie theatres these days?! Cineleisure's sound system failed me! So disappointing. :(
