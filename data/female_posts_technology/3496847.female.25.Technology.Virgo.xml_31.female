It's 3 days of: Run - 3mins Walk - 1.5mins Run - 5mins Walk - 2.5 mins **do this twice, for a total of 24mins**  5mins seems like a long time, but a few weeks ago I could barely squeeze out anything over a minute.  I really like getting my run in in the morning, it makes my whole day better.  No matter how little I accomplish during the rest of the day, at least I ran.
