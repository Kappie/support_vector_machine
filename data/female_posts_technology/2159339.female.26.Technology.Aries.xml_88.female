And here are some soundbytes from my fucked-up mouth...  "You've seen boobies before, right?"  (I showed him my shrine and he was about to open the door. I decided to forewarn him just in case... In case of what? In case of office boner.)   "You saw the exhibit with the ASIAN PROSTITUTES! Oops, did I say that too loud?"  (We talked about the MOMA and he didn't see the Diane Arbus exhibit. I deducted that he saw the other one. Then I realized that there were a lot of people walking by my desk right at my deduction.)   "Ooh... that'll be titallating."  (I don't remember what this was a response to. I just know that it was inappropriate and I made him blush. Awww...)   My problem is that there is no subtlety to my flirting. There is no coyness. Only balls on the desk. Or, in my case, vagina.
