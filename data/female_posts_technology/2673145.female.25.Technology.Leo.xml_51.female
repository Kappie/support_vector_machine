The story is about 2 couples, ending up having affairs with each other's partner. Basically it's about relationships, trust and sex.   It's a rather fun and entertaining movie. Great acting, singing and dancing. Almost like a musical on screen. Wonder if they had refer to one of the Bollywood movies. Hhaa. Great scripts and editing too! Truely enjoyable. Oh, and great bodies. ;)  I was more preoccupied with the language. Half the time I'm recalling and remembering the spanish vocab then digesting the plot. Haha. So, I failed to gather any conclusion at the end of the show. Haha.  Anyhow, it's spidey 2 today!!
