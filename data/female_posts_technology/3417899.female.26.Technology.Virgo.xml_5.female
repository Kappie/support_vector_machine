On these days, my mind is sharper, my repsonses quicker, my smiles wider...  I wish I could identify what makes a day an "awake" day... I wish I could dissect the factors and pinpoint the exact combination of parameters: is it someone I spoke with, something I wore, a song I heard, an achievement I reached, something somebody said, the weather, the time I woke up or went to sleep, whether I made love...  Today was one of these days.  Today is almost over.
