I've never wept openly at a documentary but I cried throughout the movie and I still feel residual sadness now. The movie was really powerful and I'm even more conscious of how fucking lucky I am to cruise along happily in my show-going bubble. I have my criticisms about the movie too, but really, as the daughter of two war refugees, I realize that I'm very lucky that I don't have bombs or guns or soldiers or death in my day-to-day life. My parents came here so I could see war from an air-conditioned cineplex. And what I saw was horrible. I cannot imagine what it must really be like.   The most relevant question the movie tries to answer is, "What are we fighting for?" What is the purpose of this war?  Go see this movie. It's important. Even if you dislike Michael Moore, maintain your critical sensibilities and see this film.
