Making sure that the mood is light and carefree coming from a child's eyes is a perfect setting I think. The technique she uses is memories of childhood. And I mean this as she allows you to see this essay through the memories of one child's childhood. A perfect example of this specific technique is this.......  Lunchtime was different then suppertime in that my father did not come back to the house to eat. Instead, he either took a lunch with him or (my favorite) (in other words this was a childhood memory of hers that she can remember) we took a picnic lunch to him. We never knew when these picnics would occur, but sometimes Mom would pull out the old wicker picnic basket and send us girls to the garden for fresh tomatoes and cucumbers. We knew then that we were going to find Dad in the fields.  This was to me what seems to be a perfect memory for a child to recollect when they see a picnic basket, or tomotoes and cucumbers. I for one know this for sure I have had a lot of childhood memories and this girl sure knows what a memory can mean by the looks of particular objects or places.
