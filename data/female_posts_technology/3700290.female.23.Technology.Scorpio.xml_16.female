U see...Meifang has this idea of selling handicrafts online. I am considering whether I should be joining her as I have the doubts on whether I have the stamina, money and most importantly, money to join her.  I think I wld be seeking tuition assignments first. If I do not find any assignment, I would be considering joining her.
