They need someone to be a System Administrator for their Investment Management software. Something I'm very familiar with since I spent the last 4 years working on the same type of product. Anyway, I was so shocked because the hiring manager is the nicest guy I've met in Singapore so far. He's the Head of the IT Division, but he is very unassuming, modest and very soft-spoken. It's like a culture shock for me coming from a very dog-eat-dog environment in my current company.  Anyway, I just have to live with the fact that I will be getting less pay but I still get the full benefits like medical and insurance coverage, plus I have proper leaves. It will only be 14 days, but 14 days I CAN ACTUALLY USE! Unlike now, I have 24 days, but I have only used 5 days so far in the entire year. Plus, no one is going to call me at 12:30 AM in the morning screaming at me on the phone.  Oh some things I forgot to mention, if I work for this guy, I don't have to go to not-so-wholesome KTV's and have to accompany him as he hires GRO's to entertain him. Nor will I ever have to sing for 4 hours ever again just to relieve me of my boredom! I don't have to go home at 4 AM in the morning dead drunk from finishing half a bottle of Bombay Sapphire. I don't have to inhale second hand smoke. I don't have to buy his medicine when he's sick. Plus, I don't have to fetch him from his hotel just to bring him to an event.  So there's a 50/50 chance of me staying in Singapore. If I get it, then well and good. If not, I take it as a sign from God that I really do have to go home to Manila. Either which way it goes, I'm still a winner.:)  Note for the superstitious: I had my interview on Friday the 13th at the 13th floor of my current building. It was so funny how I kept trying to find ways to escape from the office without anyone seeing me leaving on the 13th floor.
