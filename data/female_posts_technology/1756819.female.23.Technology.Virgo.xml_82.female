Its harder to portray feelings and emotions in text.  You lose tone, pauses, inflection, etc.  On the other hand I find it easier to express things in writing than say in person, or over the phone.  Despite email's limitations of being very one-sided, it is a comfortable medium for expressing things.  I also like the fact that it gives you a chance to compose what you want to say, instead of having to 'think on your feet'.    I remember as a kid I used to be afraid of phones.  Whenever the phone rang, me and my brother and sister would all yell, 'not it!'  No one wanted to answer the phone.  One time I had to call a friend of mine about a birthday party, or something like that.  I took out the phone and set it on the table.  I stared at it for awhile, picked up the receiver, listened to the dial tone, took a deep breath, started dialing, hung up again.  Walked away, walked past the table, stared at the phone for a while longer.  Listened to the dial tone again, hung up.  And so on, and so on.  I think it must have took an hour to make that phone call.  And it wasn't even a call to a boy!  So with the invention of emailing I am much better able to communicate (and no I'm not scared of phones anymore, though I still prefer ftf interactions).
