I have never felt as swoony and enthusiastic about a singer/band since my Juliana Hatfield obsession in high school. I'd only known about Bart D. for a couple of months, but I have seen him five times already. His sweet singing and impressive guitar playing make my heart swell with happiness and a general sense of well-being. If I was king, I'd ply him with fruity wine and ask him to be my court musician.  Last night he was wearing this striped shirt with a boatneck and 3/4 length sleeves. It looked cool on him, but as I thought about it, I was like, Hey, boatneck? 3/4 length sleeves?! That is a woman's shirt! Only Bart D. could pull this off. I told Abby and she said that when we saw him play at The Hemlock she swore he was wearing women's bellbottom pants. This could be true too. He is an emaciated fellow, slight and scrawny enough to merit shopping in the women's section. He was wearing the pants yesterday and they are blatant bellbottoms -- tight, but with swingy flares that make his feet look teeny. Though he may wear borderline-women's clothes, you don't notice this right away because he is so fucking cool. You are distracted by other things too, like his phenomenal musicianship, or the intriguing (non)alignment of his teeth, or the way he's always pinching his nose.  I think it would be a good idea to have a drinking game where one would take a drink everytime he pinches his nose. Drink, not shot, because since he does it all the time, it would turn into ill vomitous ruin, and many people would die from the eventual drunk driving.  Bart D. sighting -- On tuesday night he was present at the Kelley Stoltz show, front and center. He yelled out, "Why are you so good?!!!" after one extremely rockin and beautiful song. My thoughts exactly. I wanted to yell that out to Bart during his set last night, but I was afraid I would shatter my anonymity. I have to go to as many shows as I can without him thinking I am weird or psychotic. Both the beauty and the tragedy of BartD is that he is a local performer who plays frequently and in small intimate venues. The beauty is that I only have to share him with 50 people at a time; the tragedy is that he may start to recognize me.   I think I will make this blog The Blog of Mortification and Sightings of BartD.
