The day of conference calls.  Woohoo.  (Don't I sound excited about that?)  Much to my surprise, Andrew came home last night and was eager to take another float.  I call it a float because the pool is so smallish.  It's giant for a typical "flip and fill" as Arizonans call it, but it's still only two feet deep.  When short little me can sit in the pool and have the water line barely reach my neck, it's definitely not very deep.  Perfect size to float in, though.  What did I do last night?  Hmm.  I delved into Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (book 5) again.  I just can't seem to stop reading HP.  Suppose that's alright; since I've never actually *read* a book before Harry Potter, at least it's getting my mind working a bit.  Sure I write a lot, poetry, journals, and such; but I've never been one for reading fiction.  When I go to the library I most certainly am found in nonfiction, looking up books on whatever hobby I'm trying to defeat that week.  Photography, oil painting, spanish, PERL coding, drip irrigation...  who knows what I'm getting my hands dirty with.  It changes constantly.  Andrew was sweet enough to sit down and help (ok do himself) put together a database in Access for our San Tan Ranch homeowner's association survey results.  That took a while because we are not used to using Access, typically we use SQL and PHP to work with databases.  It had to be portable though and something that our board President could use.  Hopefully it works out ok.  We shall see!  I called my friend Deidra yesterday just before she got out of the hospital.  Everyone is doing great!  The new baby is a delight, and she sounds absolutely precious.  Deidra is feeling fine although heavily medicated (I would be too).  I've never had a baby but it sounds quite drastic.  I've seen it on TV a billion times...   When we were going through our year of infertility treatments I watched every baby delivery I could find on TV.  Since my miscarriage last Halloween, I can't even bare to look at a baby.  One of Andrew's cousins had a baby in the same week that we were due to have ours this May, and I can't even bring myself to a family event to see him.  I just can't.  Maybe time will help heal this constant pain I feel.  I can only hope.  Better get back to work.  Got things to do before my conference calls start.
