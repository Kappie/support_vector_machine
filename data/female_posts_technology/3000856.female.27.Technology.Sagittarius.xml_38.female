LOL Have practice tonight and have horrible cramps. Yeah I know u really wanted to know that. We have a show Sat and believe it or not I am not freaking out. I probably will be Fri though. I need to snap out of this depression. It is affecting everything I do. Have to get back to doing nothing at work today. It is so slow and boring today I can't stand it!
