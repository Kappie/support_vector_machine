And the miracle happened just as I was thinking of making some major changes in my life...  The Sabah trip was a VERY much needed break for me.. I was given 2 weeks to work in Sabah, a place I've never been to before. I planned that this trip was a great get-a-way for me to decide on certain things in my life, which I didn't had the chance to think about before due to my workload.   Here are the list of things I want to change in my life before 2005:-  1. Quit smoking - eventually, one step at a time I guess.. 2. Cut off contact with stupid jerks - Toy-Boy, Asshole  Naim (my ex) 3. Get over my ex...Focus on my career more than my love life 4. No more "PMS"  Now these might sound easy to achieve if I put all my heart and determination into it, but knowing ME....I'm quite fragile, easily influenced by my evil, negative surroundings and I can be very indecisive... It makes those things unachievable eventually. And so I'm keeping these things in mind and if I can change 3 out of 4 items, that's an accomplishment!:)  Funny how life works... Here I am trying my hardest to rectify my flaws and the negative things in my life... Making things work better for me, be happier and more content... Just as i got things figured out, comes BIGGER challenges...one after another!!!   Let's glance through my complicated love life for the past 7 years. I only started liking someone really bad, as in having a HUGE crush, back in high school. I was never "inlove" with anyone then... unlike many of my gurl frens. When I turned 19, I met my first boyfriend, but things didnt work out between us (he just disappeared) and i figured i shouldnt be wasting time looking for love. The only thing on my mind at that time was to be the top student and get into university. As i went to uni, i met my soulmate, RT. I knew he was my soulmate because, heck, he's the only person in this lifetime who can read me and have 'magical moments' happening between us everytime we're together! Fact is, he felt the same sparks as i did. BUT ofcourse, he was attached, i was just another temporary game. I loved him dearly, though things we're not meant to be between us, as my heart aches everytime he's with someone else, I believe i've loved him and i felt the real thing called love. It was pure love, nothing physical, just pure emotions...and i missed that...the emotional rush.  As time passed by, after 3 rebound relationships to replace RT, i concluded and made a public announcement to my friends that i could never find anyone else like RT. Until the day i met DC at KK airport... It all happened by chance. I felt a connection with DC, things I only felt 5 years ago with RT.   THE PROBLEM: Five bloody boring years to actually find someone by chance and then KNOWING that he's everything you've been asking for from God... But unfortunately he belongs to someone else. Damn... Blessed and cursed at the same time.. How F**Ked up is that?!!   Seriously, this shitty feeling of meeting someone so amazing and knowing the existing of chemistry but WITH restriction is just DEJA VU! Why cant things just work out for me.. For once at least. I just cant figure this out anymore... Keep meeting someone SO right but the situation SO WRONG.... Please God.. I'm not asking much... Just someone to love...Someone that's mine...  And so.. The story of my NEW adventure begins with DC... How bad is this "new, unlisted" change in my life you're wondering?? Trust me... It's the worst ever! But for sure, with this change, I've managed to eliminate item no. 2 :)  Honestly, I just don't know how long this one's gonna last. I don't know how far this relationship/affair/game is gonna go. DC tells me  "I'm not gonna end this... Only 2 things that will end this thing we have... One is when you get married... Two is only if you want me to go"    I told him the two things aren't gonna happen... Or will it ever?
