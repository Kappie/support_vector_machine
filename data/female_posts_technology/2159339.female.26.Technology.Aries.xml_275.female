Dude stands there blinking for a while.  Dude: I can just do it myself up there? Me: Yes. Dude: My  personal  papers? Me: (exasperated) Why would I lie???  In other office news, this other dude once asked me for "vanilla" file folders. Today he sent in a request for "creme" file folders. This is funny to me. If it's funny to you, then you are an admin.
