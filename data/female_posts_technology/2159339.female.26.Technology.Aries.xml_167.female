I attribute my ability to get off to the fact that I'm not completely in love with him as I was with other boys I dated (though I like him a lot) and the fact that he is into porn and doesn't have hang-ups about sex. With him, I don't foresee marriage or kids or a white picket fence in ten years; I foresee great sex tonight. And tomorrow. In fact, I believe our entire relationship is based on this. We can't stay mad at each other for long because within 24 hours one of us will get horny and this kind of a thing is always better with another person. I sure will miss that when he leaves. Also him looking kinda pretty after a shower when his hair is all up in a fro.
