There's a small but growing group here in Fredericton working to establish a LETS and we're having a potluck on Saturday!  The potluck is open to anyone interested in joining or learning more. Bring some food and a friend or two! Yours truly is going to be there; it'll be my first time there too so you wouldn't be the only stranger.  Where: 874 York Street (Unitarian Fellowship) When: Saturday, July 10. 5:30PM Website: www.geocities.com/fredlets
