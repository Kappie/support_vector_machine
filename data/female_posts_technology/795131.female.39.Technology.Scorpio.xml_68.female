We had to put what makes us happy, I've posted to it twice, and here is what I put:  Post 1:  OK  I work 6 am - 3 pm which allows me to get a full time paycheck (such as it is) and still pick up my daughter as her school is getting out and take her home like an at-home parent (my husband takes her to school on his way to work)!  We drive separate cars, we used to not even have 1!  I get rave reviews at work, I must say so myself. And the call center I work for hasn't been outsourced to India...yet!  I can listen to what ever music I want on my radio/cd player at my desk, and have yet to get caught playing on the internet during the day as much as I do!  My 10 year old daughter does an exact perfect impersonation of Patrick the Starfish from Sponge Bob Square Pants, saying "May I take your hat sir?" like an idiot! It makes me laugh to hard I'm still laughing!  14,000 Hmong refugees in Thai camps are going to be elligible to immigrate to the US this summer, and most will probably come here to Minnesota, which make MN great, and on a purely selfish level, allows me to eat more Hmong food and hear more keej music!  It is almost spring and I won't have to wear a coat and boots out.  My daughters math-tutoring at Sylvan learning center is working! Her math skills are improving after 2 years of watching her suffer!  I get to chat to Ant fans all over the world, here and at only-lovers every day!  I still can't believe I got to see the year 2000!  I love tea, I'm going to make another cup right now!   Post 2: In 1983 when I was 18 years old I got an amazing scholarship to attend a 4-year college, my dream come true. Strangely, it was in St. Paul Minnesota, a location I knew absolutely nothing about. I even had to pull out an atlas to figure out where it was. The college experience itself was amazing, very extreme, both good and bad, but I really was lucky to get it, especially because of its location.  As soon as I arrived, and the taxi was taking me from the airport to the school I looked out the window and thought My God, I've seen this place in my dreams! All those times growing up and feeling like I was in the wrong place...this looks exactly like what I was thinking of!  Its been 21 years now and I still haven't lost that feeling! The extreme sub zero cold and the 12+ inches of snow don't really happen enough days per year to be significant to me. Its a great place both to spend your money, restaurants, concerts etc...and a great place to be broke because there are so many parks and museums and recreational centers and libraries and other events for free. There are enough freaks here to keep me in company..athough I do find that they're harder to find as I get older. I can't bear to be away from Minneapolis and St. Paul for more than about 2 weeks at a time!  I am deeply proud to be able to claim past senators Hubert Humphrey, Eugene McCarthy and Paul Wellstone as my political forbears in the Minnesota Democrats Farmers and Labor Party. Not to disagree with or offend anyone else's politics here, but that's just something that suits who I am so well, its really amazing to me.  Did I mention that I just really really like it here? And that my 'new' (5+ years now) house is walking distance from two lakes with public beaches (free!) , open all summer?  And every time I double-check with my 10 year old daughter to verify that she still likes her school, she insists that she wouldn't want to go anywhere else! I just NEED her to know that if she were ever unhappy in her school I would immediately find her a new one and transfer her, but she insists she loves her school, and she should know because she's been there for 5 years!
