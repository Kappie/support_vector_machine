Is it when you have gone through all of the crazy life experiences and you are lying on your death bed reviewing them in your mind? Is it when you are ready to give birth to your first child and your heart is so overwhelmed with love for your husband and your child that you have no idea how on earth you ever lived without him or how you ever got so lucky? I need to know if this is it. Am I living the “happily ever after” that we read about in childhood storybooks?
