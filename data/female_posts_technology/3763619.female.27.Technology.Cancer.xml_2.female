Throughout our friendship he has mentioned (at least a half dozen times) his desire to move West (He currently resides in Chicago). Each time he talked about it, I would always get really upset, but before I got too worked up, he had already changed his mind about moving. It was never the right time for him, and he didn't want to leave his friends and family. He cried wolf so many times that it eventually didn't bother me anymore when he'd bring it up, as I knew this would soon blow over as it did so many times before. I guess the time for his move has finally come. I received a call from him about 2 or 3 months ago saying he was finally going to do it. In the few months that have past since then, he quit his job, found an apartment in L.A. and had all of his stuff shipped there. He is leaving for good on August 2, just 4 days away. I'm not even going to get to see him before he goes. As I mentioned previously, I don't see him all that often anyway, but the fact is, I always knew he was only 30 minutes away if I ever needed him or wanted to hang out with him. Now, he's going to be a plane ride away. I am happy for him, if this is what he wants, but I can't help but feeling sad as well. I guess that's selfish of me to feel that way, but it's also human nature. I just hope he finds whatever it is he's looking for out there. I know we are still going to talk, but I also know that I am going to miss him.
