I suppose that everyone goes through them from time to time again. I try to look at it positively, you know, "the glass is full!"  *that is until I dump it! No seriously, sometimes you have to just keep on smiling, even though you know your first instinct was wrong.  It has been a rough couple of weeks trying to maintain positive imagery of "my life". New experiences though, are good, learning is good, mistakes mean that we are doing something (not just sitting on our buttkiss!) Does anyone see the smoke coming out of these ears? Something must be working up there!
