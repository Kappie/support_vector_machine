       
      Sometimes....  I get overwhelmed by the amount of choices I have.  I get frustrated by my lack of drive, focus, determination, stamina.   I want to give up, hide under the covers, run away from you all.  I want to stop feeling like I am always *on*, unable to break, not allowed to be down.  I think of living as a chore, a way to kill time, a form of entertainment for God.  I think that death is gift, a vacation from the montony, a freedom from feeling.  I can understand why you run, silently screaming, so far far away from me.   I want to fade away, quietly, invisibly
