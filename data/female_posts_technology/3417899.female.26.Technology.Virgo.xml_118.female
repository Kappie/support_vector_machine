       
      I woke up early today (well, early for a lazy Sunday morning), and the silent, sunny day outside seemed inviting.  I went downstairs, in my nightgown, and walked over to a quiet corner of my apartment complex.  It's a small patch of grass, with a few trees for shade, and the sweet honey smell of some flower drenched in the air.   I lay in the grass and looked up at the clouds. I haven't done that since I was a little girl.  I just lay there for two hours. I may have looked like a homeless, lonely person to a passerby.  Or perhaps like a girl who had been violated - with barely any clothes on, lying alone on the grass.   But I was happy. And calm.  And I thought of what I've done, and what I will do, and what I should do.  And I forgave.  And then I let my mind go blank.   It's on mornings like this -  The warm sun tickling,  The complete silence surrounding,  The peacefulness... It's on mornings like this that I know - things will be all right.
