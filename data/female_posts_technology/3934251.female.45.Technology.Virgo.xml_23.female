This involved a lot of bleach and elbow grease on Jonathan's part and shopping on mine, and quite a lot of collective pleading for a window of dry weather. This appeared to be highly unlikely during one particularly heavy storm on my way to the cash and carry when I was more tempted by the large rubber dinghy than the chicken drumsticks.  Cos I knew we wouldn't (or should that be shouldn't?) get too pissed on the Saturday night, we went out on Friday and it was still spitting with rain when we staggered in at 2.00am. When we got up bright and early on Saturday morning (11-ish, pretty early for me) it was glorious and although the sunshine wasn't constant all through the day, it never rained a drop and stayed warm.  A big thank you, to whom it may concern, for arranging top weather for us.
