I swear he is one of the most handsome actors in Hollywood right now! I like his clean cut look and his pefect bone structure. Plus, he is well-educated because unlike most child actors, he took time out to lead a normal life and get a proper education.  The new Batman movie is directed by Christopher Nolan. He became well-known for his work Memento, a movie that told the story backwards, and questioned the very nature of memory.  I can't wait for July 2005!
