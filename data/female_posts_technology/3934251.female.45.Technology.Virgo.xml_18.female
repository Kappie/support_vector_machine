I guess  potentially  my views are available for millions to see, but, realistically, who the hell is going to find them? I wouldn't know where to start, why should they? So, I am viewing this as purely being for my benefit. If anyone wants to look, then that's fine, but this is for me.  (And it's cheaper than stock-piling shoes and handbags)
