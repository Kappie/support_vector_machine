Ever so slightly I glide my body closer to his seeking lips.  My body moves restlessly on top of the fresh sheets feeling so cool under my body.  He slowly suckles my breast until my nipple hardens with need.   Grabbing his shoulders I pull him closer to kiss his lips, to nip his chin.   I moan with yearning, needing him now.  I moan with disappointment and with desire of the night.  He will be back in my arms once more tonight.
