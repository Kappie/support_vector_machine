I hadn't. Since then, I see them everywhere. It's like an alien invasion or some cult taking over. I had never noticed them until somebody pointed them out.   I didn't know anything about weblogs until a couple of months ago - pretty surprising as I considered myself quite internet-savvy. Yet, I had never heard the term or read a Blog. Then a friend sent me a link to his own blog, then another and another. Then I started my own. Now, everywhere I turn there are blogs. People seem to be talking about them everywhere. Time magazine had an article about Blogs. So did another magazine (the name escapes me right now - I'll get back to you on this). A friend I know started working for a company providing tools to consolidate blogs (bloglines.com). They are everywhere. And I never noticed them until someone had pointed them out.   I wonder what other phenomena I am still in the dark about.
