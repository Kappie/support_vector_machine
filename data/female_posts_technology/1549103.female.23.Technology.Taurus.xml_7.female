I've held plenty of jobs, and if you consider my occupation as student, I'm sure I average well over 40 hours a week.  But there's something different about having work contained to an 8-hour slot in the day.  I am enjoying my work here, but oddly enough I find it much more draining than my heaviest load of coursework has ever been.  What scares me is when I come home from work and want nothing more than to sit in front of the TV for the specific purpose of burning up the rest of the day, and I realize how easily I could turn into one of "those people", stuck on the treadmill.  The phrase killing time comes to mind, because the purpose is jumping ahead a few hours to bedtime.
