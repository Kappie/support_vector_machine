It's a shame you can't buy them from Australia, just when we need them most.  Saturday whizzed past in a blur yet again, what with the shopping for mother's birthday present, conferring with my sister on other people's mobile phones because I didn't bring mine, get accosted in the street yet again by the lovely Coralie, who I feel is stalking me (not really, we just keep running into each other at various locations) and then having coffee with her, and then hanging out a bit with the nieces and then going for a walk.    The ladies in the sewing shop were so lovely, I love supporting small local business.  I've made a pact with myself to try and do this more often.  They were so excited that I was buying a sewing machine for my mother's birthday and said what a wonderful gift and hoping that their children would do the same for them. Honestly,  I would have paid ten times more for the thing, just to be spoken about in such glowing terms!   I also ventured into the Yarn Barn again, gosh I love that shop. They had some beautiful cotton. The sign on the door said the shop would be closed for some time in November while the wool lady went to a wool conference.  A wool conference? Imagine that, possibly the only sort of conference where you would have to speak quite loudly so you can be heard over the clatter of knitting needles.  Perhaps they'll talk about compulsive people like me who buy five knitting books from Amazon on Tuesday nights when they should be writing job applications.      I've been thinking a lot of the whole 'opening of the nail salon dream'.  I think that becoming a nail technician would solve a lot of my work-related issues.  Just think, making people feel good, listening to them about their problems, $40, thankyou very much - next! Excellent.    Or opening a  urlLink Baker's Delight  franchise - everyone loves a bun.  But maybe paying someone else to get up at 4am.
