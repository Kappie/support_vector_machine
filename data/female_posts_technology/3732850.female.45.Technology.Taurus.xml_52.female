That they are on their way to the hospital to pay their last respects to their wonderful father and grandfather.  This catches me off guard for a moment until I continue to read further on.  I think it's because of the way it just starts out being the nice day and I find it hard to believe when someone you know is sick but with his suffering the peace finally comes to an end for his family and himself when he passes away, knowing his loved ones were there, by his side, to comfort him.  I think the author, while talking about his grandfather and what I also see, is the sense of humor being used, the way is grandfather always smiled and never letting his family know his pain, the talking of childhood memories brings me back to the little time I spent with my grandfather because he passed away when I was young. His birthday was March 10th and what a coincidence, so is mine.  I remember both my grandma and grandpa often, especially while reading this story, ONE HOUR.  This story takes me back to the day my Grandpa passed away and my dad wouldn't let me go to the funeral.  I remember him chewing snooze and spitting it into a folgers coffee can, holding me on his lap and the lump he had on the one side of his face by his chin because it was obvious for anyone to see.  I also remember my grandmother being put in the home shortly after my grandpa died.  It wasn't long before she passed away and I remember getting to go to her funeral and I'll never forget how beautiful she looked.  I can still picture her to this day and she looked like an angel and that is exactly how I remember her.  She was a very caring person.  This is the grandparents on my dad's side and I wasn't born yet when my mom's parents passed away so I only go by storys that I hear from my mom or her sister or brother.  Mostly, I just remember my Dad's parents though.  It doesn't seem like the memories ever fade.  Only that the time gets longer that they've been gone.  I loved them both very much.
