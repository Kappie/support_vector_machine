The atmosphere is a lot like Bourbon Street (without the nudity - sorry guys).  They had two different stages with live music and lots of street vendors and the coolest thing, without a doubt, is the 4 block-long canopy and show:   urlLink     urlLink      urlLink     urlLink      urlLink     urlLink      urlLink     urlLink
