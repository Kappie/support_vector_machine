But it was a beautiful evening and I decided that I should take advantage of the nice weather.  Afterall, soon it will be snowing again.  So I grabbed my keys, put on my running shoes and a sweatshirt and headed down the road.  Down Knapp St, and up Ball St.  Did you know that there is an elementary school and a small park on Ball St?  I didn't.  On the way I saw a girl walking her dog, an elderly couple walking and a person trying to calm down a screaming baby (on her porch).  It's nice to just walk around and be alone with your thoughts.  Just me and my thoughts, strolling down the street.  I have decided to do that more often.  I like to explore the neighborhood on foot, you see so much more that way.  You see the smaller things that you wouldn't notice in a car.
