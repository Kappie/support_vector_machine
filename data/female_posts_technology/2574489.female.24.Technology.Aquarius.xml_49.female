Husband can't stand skim milk or else it'll be skim.  2. What's your favorite cereal?  Used to be cinnamon toast cereal but I'm getting tired of it.  I also like Frosted Mini Wheats.  3. How often do you eat out? Do you want that to change?  We used to eat out every weekend.  Boy was that yummy.  For the past 1/2 year or so, its been more like 2x a month, with at least one additional visit to East Buffet.  Yes, we're changing.  Tyring to cut down no zero eating out a month to expensive places. Maybe just 1-2 visits to East Buffet. Husband loves that place.  4. What do you plan on having for dinner tonight? Got a recipe for that?  We were gonna get Pho (T and I) at our favorite Vietnamese place.  But he just told me right now he's not feeling too well.  He said he feels like he's getting strep throat. Oh brother.  I'll probably eat leftover teriyaki chicken. Recipe: Chicken, cut in thin slices, garlic, onions and kikkoman's teriyaki sauce.  Or get some fast food. (Yay, just got our tax refund!)  5. What's your favorite restaurant? Why?  My favorite is Carraba's Italian Grill.  We always get good to great servers, great food, great atmosphere. Used to be Olive Garden but I've had too many bad servers at their different restaurants and this turned me off.   Umm...that's it for this week.  And again, Yay to tax refund and some $$ in my pocket!  I'm gonna sign up for  urlLink 24 Hour Fitness .
