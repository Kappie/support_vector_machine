Two people dying is PUSHING IT--I will handle it and cope. But the possibility of THREE? THREE IS TOO MANY!!!   I'm a fairly unemotional person but when I heard the news, I felt just... so distraught and sobbed like an animal for a long time. Then I went upstairs to tell my roommates and felt a little better. (sniff!)   So I took the day off from work yesterday and my brother took "The Sick and Ailing Tour" aka "The Skin and Bones Tour." I wore my big Elton John 70s glasses to hide my puffy eyes and he saw them and said, "Those are really big glasses" and I said "Yes" and he said, "No, they're REALLY big!" and I said "Yup" and he paused and concluded, "They're silly" and I agreed.   We drove to Hayward to visit my dad who was moved from the ICU to a regular wing and he looks awful. There were tubes and tape and bags. His shoulders were bony and his arms were like sticks. And his mouth was wide open which was shocking. It was beyond the relaxed "sleeping open-mouth." It looked like he had a fright. His eyes were open into tiny slits and we tried to wave at him and talk to him but there was no eye movement. There was no registry. We touched him and said "Hi!" and "Hello!" but no response.   We stayed there for a while and the doctor came in to talk to us. He said that my dad was dehydrated and they were slowly rehydrating him with the tubes. They said he was looking better than yesterday but they would be evaluating him on a daily basis. It's unclear whether he'll recover. It's uncertain whether he'll be able to move or even eat. We'll just have to wait.   We then drove to Redwood City to visit my grandma at the hospital there and we were greeted by three aunts who are keeping vigil over her. The doctor gave her 10 days. She's on morphine now so she's pretty sedated. Her eyes are closed but sometimes she'll open them real wide and look at something faroff... then they'll close again. I waved and greeted her but she didn't see me. She didn't register. She's still breathing heavily then stopping for long periods of time. Once I held my breath to see how long she stopped breathing and I ran out of air. A few seconds later she continued breathing. My brother said he overheard the doctor say that she's going to stop breathing for longer periods of time and then she will just stop breathing. Her hand is still puffy and purple and I know that beyond the morphine the physical pain must be excruciating. So we're all just waiting for the end for my grandma. I hope it will come soon because it will be an end to her pain.   After that we visited my auntie who talked animatedly but is still very weak and thin. Her cancer's spread and she won't be undergoing anymore chemo because she's not strong enough. We chatted for a bit then we walked across the way to my uncle's house (her brother) to sit in on the talks for my grandma with a funeral home director. This may seem gauche to write about the business of dying, so if you're appalled STOP HERE. If you're curious, read on...   The funeral director I recognized from January because he took care of the arrangements for my grandpa's funeral. He was very nice and was just going over the details of the funeral contract for my grandma. My relatives even negotiated a casket upgrade from metal to wood. While discussing the funeral arrangements and talking about how recent my grandpa had passed, my cousin, Little B, joked to the director,"So, is there a group discount for 20 or more?" and we all laughed.   Later when the director had left, Little B told us one of my aunt's went comparison shopping at a casket outlet. My brother and I's eyes both bugged out of our heads and we both whispered, "WHAT??? There's a CASKET OUTLET?" and she said just as incredulously, "Yeah! Can you believe it?" While we were sitting there, word came over from across the way that my auntie inquired whether we'd made arrangements for her ceremony, "since the director was already here and all." My cousin whispered, "Jeez! Morbid!" but that pragmatism towards death is typical in my family: most of my aunts and uncles have already paid for their own burial plots. At my great-aunt's funeral some time ago, while the tractor was pouring dirt over her coffin, my unclebragged to Little B, "See that patch underneath the wheel? That's MY plot."
