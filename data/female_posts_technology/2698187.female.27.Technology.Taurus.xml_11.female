Robyn came up..and she had a couple of curve balls to throw at me.  Okay, the best one..she ran into Jackie!!! Jackie...probably has been the closest friend I ever had, well one of two. Closer than Robyn in many ways. I find myself not telling Robyn a lot of things for some odd reason. Like this weekend, she asked me about what was going in in my love life. For some reason I didn't feel like telling her. So I sort of lied. I didn't tell her anything about Derreck. Not that there is a whole lot to tell. But I didn't discuss my feelings or anything. I didn't bother to tell her that Al has not totally left the picture. I just didn't feel like it. I don't know if it has to do anything with her constant stupidity when it comes to men. No, that's not it.   But I digress.   Anyway, she ran into Jackie and through a turn of events I actually got to talk to her! I'm excited. When she said "Hi Dani!" That brought back SOOOOO many fond memories. I loved Jackie...in a lot of ways. I still do. And I hope that we can pick up where we left off in a way. I intend to do my part in keeping in touch, at least once a week. When I go down next month, I at least want to do dinner or spend some time at her house just talking and catching up. So I'm excited.  Well, back to Robyn. She's on the verge of being back with that stupid azz Darius. Does it really work the 2nd time around? Why go backwards when she can move forward? I just really need for her to take a break. She has gone from fucked up relationship to fucked up relationship. I think her self esteem is low...although she is quite a looker. When we were at the Capital Jazz Fest, she was in jeans and sneakers, no makeup, hood on her head and dudes were still giving her the eye. I don't know what it is...some women just have "it." Sometimes I wish I had "it." But then again, I'm glad that I haven't been scarred by all those relationships...had all those men pull their dicks out and leave the evil parts of their souls behind...inside of me, for me to absorb and deal with. I don't know. I care for Robyn a lot, but there is just something there that keeps me from considering her my best friend. But then that's my own judgemental shit coming into play too. Who am I to judge her and how she lives her life. Her and Darius are talking marriage. Perhaps it will work. I don't really like that mofo. But I guess I will have to fake it.  Anywho, the jazz fest was rained out again. I froze my bippy off for 8-9 hours. But all in all, I had a good time. I love those type of things, sitting in the park, eating, drinking and listening to good music. Robyn and I were joined by a couple of her friends that came down from NYC and Charlotte. One just left her job to pursue her dreams. That's inspiring....  Al called on Friday night. Said he had been busy and hadn't had time to e-mail me his numbers. Haven't called him back yet. I guess I will tomorrow. Don't want to be rude. To be honest, I'm just not interested. Not attracted to him. But there's some reason that he came back into my life after almost 2 months. So I'll see how this plays out.  Derreck is still kinda on the brain. But he's fading. It was good to hear from him on my bday. But I think I'm feeling like if his feelings were really that strong for me, he would come for me. He would have called, just showed up at my door, send me and e-mail that we needed to talk. When a man really wants to be with you, I just feel like he's going to make that extra effort. If he has to make a fool out of himself, he'll do that. Derreck just doesn't feel that way about me. The man that feels that way about me hasn't made his presence known yet. You know, I used to say that I can't wait to be loved. Correction, I can't wait to love me...
