A couple years back he wanted to get rich off of internet porn. And, the catholic in me was upset and morally offended. She stomped her saddle shoes then readjusted her knee socks. I said, "Hey quiet down in there, you're ruining my game!" I quickly got off the phone to sort through my mixed emotions.   I advocate porn usage. I love female nudity. But I don't want to be with someone who once considered "pornographer" as a career. Because look at two pornographers: Hugh Hefner and Larry Flynt. Hugh Hefner is always surrounded by a coterie of 7 or 8 of his girlfriends and Larry Flynt had a voracious sexual appetite that his wife couldn't satiate. She herself would look for girls to satisfy him. I can't do this. I don't want to live like that. I don't want a greedy man. I want a simple life with a simple man who doesn't have a "porn problem." He also openly checks out other girls in front of me. I told him that it's downright rude and he said, "Take it or leave it, baby!"   I can leave it because even though I like him okay, my disbelief isn't suspended. No matter how many times he tries to convince me he's just "big-boned" he is still fat.  He still has 4 chins. He is still hairy. He still snores even though he says "It's my cold." Well the cold's over and the snoring is still around. He still talks too much and only about himself. He gives me rides in the morning and when work is through, but he doesn't do it out of sincere niceness--he does it because he gets to congratulate himself for being nice. He does it because he gets to say, "I give her rides in the morning and at night" and to hear people say to him, "Oh, you're so nice!"  Another example of his character: we exchanged handmade cards for Valentine's Day and he spent the whole time admiring the card HE made.    Everything would be okay if he didn't talk so much. Everything would be okay if he talked less and listened more. If he didn't make fun of my clothes or my shoes. If he didn't have a wandering eye. If he wasn't so self-congratulatory. If he was humble, and modest, and sweet. Sincerely so.    XX is okay for now but I'm not gonna marry him. One of my goals for this year is to experience orgasm through intercourse, something that has eluded me so far. And to do so, I need a partner... so for now, I will have sex with a wannabe pornographer, as he is the only person who applied for the position.
