Bardric chuckled in response. "So have you heard about the turmoil to the south?" The wizard changed the subject.  "There's always turmoil to the south. Which do you mean in particular?" Trellian asked as he closed his eyes dreamily.  "Well, from what I hear there is a problem between man and elves and dwarves. For some odd reason that no one knows about, they decided to wake up one morning and hate each other. Maybe it's the water." The wizard mused as he shifted his weight on his rock.  "You always say it's the water whenever something strange happens. It has never been the water." The dragon said quickly as he shook his head slowly. "But what would cause that must strife in one area. Sure I can understand a small problem with a family or something but not what you just described."  "I did hear a few rumors that a Halfling traveled through the lands right before everything blew up. I am not sure if that had anything to do with it or if it is just coincidence." Bardric hummed slightly to himself as he thought about what he just said.  "Well why don't you just go down and find out, old wizard and let me to my sun." Trellian said quickly.  "Actually I am but I was wondering if you could just fly me down. I really don't feel like walking or riding all that way. My bones aren't what they used to be." The wizard said plaintively while trying to look old.  Trellian snorted. "I might as well or else you'll just stay here and badger me. We'll start out in the morning so let me have my nap so I can be rested." The dragon curled his head on top of his forelegs.  Bardric grinned as he walked back to his camp.
