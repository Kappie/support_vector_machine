In Leeds, especially my office, the hot muggy weather is increasing the number of staff leaving. And it's making me laugh. Obviously we would prefer the murder option, but knowing the directors are crapping themselves is a reasonable alternative.    Anyway, all the best Karin and Marie with your new contracts, your new employers gain is most definitely this shit tip's loss. You go girls. Keep in touch. I'll miss you lots and I love you both dearly x x x
