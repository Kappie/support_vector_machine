You're lucky really, because all I would have blogged on about would have  been work (naturally), the vagaries of love and the current preoccupation  with spending money at $2 shops.  However, I have taken up with the knitting with a vengeance once again and  baby, I'm on a roll.  I've made two beanies, another scarf, and am currently in the process of  knitting a fantastic faux fur Cossack-style hat!  The first beanie was really a triumph, if I do say so myself - knitting on  circular needles - (which would make an excellent murder-weapon, perfect for  garrotting someone who really gets up your nose) - was tricky to start off with.   Was I knitting the same row again and again? Where did it start? Where did it end? It was a bit like knitting deja vu.  However, my mother, who is amazingly talented, worked out the whole circular knitting-needle procedure - even though she'd never used them before herself - what a woman!  Once I got going, I couldn't stop.   It was a circular knitting frenzy!   (I really need to get out of the house more, eh?)  Sadly, however, many people felt the need to disparage my very first knitted beanie solely on the basis of colour (it's a pale pink).  It even has kitten ears! The pattern was from this excellent  urlLink knitting book  (which even though I bought online, found two weeks later in my local bookshop -sheesh!).  My next project will definitely need to be items for two special babies to be born very shortly.    I feel, it's excellent when you can channel obsessive compulsiveness into useful things.
