It was hard on my brother and I because we lived in Montana and my mom lived in Colorado and we wanted badly to live with her and we didn't want to live with my dad. When, he got us back to Montana he changed and became a mean person. Before that he was nice. Then, he was never around for us just for supper time was the only time he had for us.  Now, if you ask my 13 year old son he would say that when his dad and I divorced was the best day of his live. He told me when I got back from getting my divorce he said to me "It was about time that you left him." My children have always supported me on my divorce. The only thing that botters them is the fact that their dad only gives them the phone calls, but he won't see them. He told them before that if he has to pay child support then he will never see them. He says he shouldn't have to pay to see them. Some parent's don't think how bad they destroy kid's when they are not in their lives.
