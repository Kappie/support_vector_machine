Although no one (that I know of) is reading my blog, it is still scary to know that this info is out there in the world.    I've decided to take a light-hearted break before I post part 2.   I'm looking forward to watching Big Brother 5 tonight. I'm hoping that one of the meathead jocks do not get HOH (head of household.) I hate those guys.  I watched the films "Wonderland"  "The Butterfly Effect" the other day. They were both good in their own ways, but Wonderland was better. Val Kilmer is a great actor.   Part 2 may be posted tomorrow...we'll see.
