Before things get worst than it already is... I cant believe that once again I'm at the happiest moment of my life, having the chance to meet someone so special like DC and yet I'm just filled with sadness and hurting deep inside knowing that he'll never be mine...  I found this article on Soul Mates...I'm pondering upon this paragraph:  Remember that every relationship we share is a way for us to become enlightened. They come to us to teach and help us remember that God has sent us only angels.      If I Ain't Got You - Alicia Keys-   Some people live for the fortune, Some people live just for the fame Some people live for the power yeah, Some people live just to play the game Some people think that the physical things, Define what's within I've been there before, but that life's a bore so full of the superficial  Some people want it all But I don't want nothing at all If it ain't you baby If I ain't got you baby Some people want diamond rings  Some just want everything But everything means nothing  If I ain't got you...yeah  Some people search for a fountain, Promises forever young  Some people need three dozen roses, And that's the only way to prove you love them  And in a world on a silver platter, And wondering what it means No one to share, No one who truly cares for me  If I ain't got you with me baby Nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing If I ain't got you with me baby
