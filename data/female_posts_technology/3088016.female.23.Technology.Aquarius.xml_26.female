Since Blogger no longer offers the upgrades to these tools, I have found a great external commenting system called  urlLink BlogBack .  It's even nicer that it's free.   If you have your own blog, consider using them.  If you don't, then comment the heck out of mine!    Anna, you can post your story now.  Note to everyone else: Views expressed by commenters are not necessarily those of the blog author.
