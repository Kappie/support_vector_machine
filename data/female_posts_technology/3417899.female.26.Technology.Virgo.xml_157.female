I know, it is not the most feminine trait in the world, but there you have it.   In one of my recent "porn searches" I found a semi-porn blog. In this blog, a woman writes of her fantasies, posts links to her favorite pornographic stories and material, etc. In her latest post, she had written an eloquent piece about how women occasionally like to be "taken", more forcefully conquered, without necessarily playing the whole sentimental game. I thought it was well put, and quite true, and was careless enough (as usual) to post a comment. My simple comment ("Hear, hear") is not the careless part, it was the fact I signed with my blog address that was careless.   Ever since (It's been a few days) I have been getting hundreds of hits on my blog, from people who clicked on that comment. (Once again, I know this courtesy of  urlLink Blogpatrol ).  Well, my fellow porn lovers, I am sorry to disappoint you, but this  not  a pornographic blog... Despite what my comment may have led you to think. At least it isn't  yet ... ;-)
