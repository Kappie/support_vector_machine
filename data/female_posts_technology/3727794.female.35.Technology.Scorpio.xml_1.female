My first scarf that I knit was from the Memorable Women line from Schaefer Yarns. I used Helen Keller and it turned out so colorful. My life is lived wearing black black black, white white white and khaki, khaki, khaki. When I decided to knit, I decided I had to bring some color into my life. This was my first venture. I wore it through the winter and the spring and even pulled it out this summer once or twice just because.  Jildo's scarf is also of the memorable women line, in Margaret Sanger. Her story is pretty cool, in 1916 she opened the first birth control clinic and after being arrested many times, ended up as the first president of International Planned Parenthood. I thought it was cool that someone way back in the early 1900's was taking steps to allow women to control their own lives. I also absolutely loved the colors, such vibrant burgandies and such. I love the texture of these yarns, it gives personality to the scarves I'm making. I'll make my daughter a scarf from this as well once I take a short break and finish my first felted purse.     My son doesn't like being left out, as most patterns seem "girly" to him. He's 4 1/2 yrs and rough and tumble, but still likes to snuggle and hold my hand. One of the older ladies hanging out at the Olathe shop showed me a Schaefer yarn (OK so I'm stuck on those to start with) that looks like camouflage when knitted up, so that'll make Joey's scarf for this winter.  My felted purse is being knitted with 2 strands of Noro Kureyon color yarn. It's GORGEOUS. I love the colors, going this weekend to get my double pointed needles to make the handles for the purse.  If this felts as pretty as I think it will, I'm going to have to get some more of this stuff!
