Without a fast-speed connection to counter mind-numbing life-wasting work, we are left with the stark reality that work, in its simplest form, sucks. And not only does it suck, it fucking sucks.  Without a constant dose of celebrity gossip, I feel anxious and hostile. Especially towards this prick on the 2nd floor. Normally he just bugs me and I open  urlLink Daily Dish  to calm down, but today my hostility is untempered and I want to kill him. His name is Dick. That’s his actual name. Actually he goes by his full name, but in my head, he’s a Dick. He’s a condescending asshole that I want Monique from the WB to slap the shit out of. I’m not good at slapping people because I have feeble arms, but if Monique from the WB came by to give him a good slapdown, I’d stand on his desk, moon him, and send a big fat poot towards his face. I feel immense hostility towards this dildo-assbrain because he was talking to me about something or other and I mentioned that I don’t drive a car and he gay-drawls most snottily, “Ohhhhh… that explains a LOT.” Fuckin assface poobag! Kiss my ass! POOT! POOT! Oh, I’m sorry, did I do that?  It’s all in his condescending prickmiser tone and his beady judgmental eyes. I like most people, but this assfucker deserves no sympathy.  Speaking of pooting, I’ve been pondering within my head, Who the heck told us to hold in our poots in polite society? This causes debilitating stomach pains and the unnecessary exercise of the gluteus maximus. But today I understood why. I was washing my bowl in the staff room when I heard a squeak emit from the person getting coffee. I thought, Oh it’s just his shoe squeaking the linoleum cuz who the heck would let out a poot in polite staff room society? But then I stepped over to check the coffee selection and there was a most foul odor lingering in the air. It was a POOT! I swear it was a rank poot! Fucker. I quickly moved aside to show the offender I was most displeasured by his foul emission and appalled by his impolite act. And by “quickly moved aside” I really mean: walked slowly back to the sink and avoided eye contact.  So the reason why it’s polite to hold in your gas is because it fuckin stinks. Have you ever been to a show? I have, and obscured by loud loud music and the cramped crowd, people think they can just poot freely. You stand there, and all of a sudden it smells like farts. You didn’t hear it so there was no air raid warning to flee; there’s all these people around you so you don’t know who to slap down; and it's really packed so it's hard to get away. And suppose you do get away, then everyone will think you're the culprit fleeing the scene.  Today is Green Marble’s birthday eve, and also XX’s. They were born on the same day, different year. Another notable born on August 5: Beastie Boy  urlLink MCA  who turns 40 this year. Happy Birthday Eve everyone! Tonight I will be w/rapping presents.
