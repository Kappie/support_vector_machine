(The  urlLink puppet episode of Angel  is one of my favorites.)      Avenue Q is about puppets trying to find their purpose in life.  One is a recent college graduate with a degree in English with no job prospects; another is a closeted gay Republican investment banker.  There are puppet sex scenes and songs like "Everyone's a Little Bit Racist". There's even a whole song about schaudenfreude.  It's definitely one of my favorite musicals so far.   Afterwards, we went to  urlLink Ben Benson's Steak House  for dinner (123 W 52nd, between 6th and 7th).  The prime rib steak was one of the best steaks I've ever eaten, and was big enough to take home half for later. The decor is really old-school and classy.  It's pricey, but worth it.
