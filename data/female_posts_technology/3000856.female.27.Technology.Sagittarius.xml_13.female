Got a list of houses to look at and sent my resume out to other places.  More importantly I need to find a bike.  If I don't get my motorcycle this summer...... I WILL FREAK OUT! LOL I have been waiting too many damn years for this thing.  I need to get some stuff done before bed so I will halla at yas laterz.
