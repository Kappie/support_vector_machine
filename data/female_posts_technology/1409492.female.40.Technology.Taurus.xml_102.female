Got home after some food and checked what TiVo had grabbed for me. I was delighted to see it had recorded the Pierce Brosnan version of  Robinson Crusoe  for me, because you-know-who had a small part in it.  He died before the opening credits. So I turned it off and went to bed.   Here's a  link to a news story about our  urlLink skydiving grandmother    Monday we  watched 4 more episodes of 24. I'm enjoying them, but they trotted out the Amnesia trick pretty doggone early in the series's lifetime. And a car exploded from rolling down a hill. That descends from cheese to schlock, but hey not all the episodes can be tightwire exciting.    I'm off  to stamp out bugs. I must have this stuff done by Friday, Or Else. So in closing, I bring you these words of wisdom from Steve Martin:   Be courteous, kind and forgiving,  Be gentle and peaceful each day,  Be warm and human and grateful,  And have a good thing to say.   Be thoughtful and trustful and childlike,  Be witty and happy and wise,  Be honest and love all your neighbours,  Be obsequious, purple, and clairvoyant.   Be pompus, obese, and eat cactus,  Be dull, and boring, and omnipresent,  Criticize things you don't know about,  Be oblong and have your knees removed.   Be tasteless, rude, and offensive,  Live in a swamp and be three dimentional,  Put a live chicken in your underwear,  Get all excited and go to a yawning festival.   O.K. everybody!  Be courteous, kind and forgiving,  Be gentle and peaceful each day,  Be warm and human and grateful,  And have a good thing to say.   Be thoughtful and trustful and childlike,  (O.K. everybody on this!)  Be witty and happy and wise,  Be honest and love all your neighbours,  Be obsequious, purple, and clairvoyant.  (Let 'em hear you outside!)   Be pompus, obese, and eat cactus,  (Everybody sing!)  Be dull, and boring, and omnipresent,  Criticize things you don't know about,  Be oblong and have your knees removed.   (Ladies only)  Be tasteless, rude, and offensive,  (Now the men)  Live in a swamp and be three dimentional,  (Everybody)  Put a live chicken in your underwear,  Go into a closet and suck eggs.
