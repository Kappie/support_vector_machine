I call M to tell him I have his cat basket and this is the dialog:  Me: "Hi, I've got your cat basket, can I bring it over" M: "Oh, I guess this isn't really a good time" Me: "But it will only take a minute and you're already home" M: "Yeah but... blah blah blah ...Panama"  Me: "Did you say Panama?" M: "Yeah they say I can go now" Me (internal dialogue): "WTF?" Me: "What the fuck?" M: "Oh yeah, I didn't tell you... blah blah blah ...going to Panama for a work thing." Me: "Oh, I see" M: "So I went out last night and now I'm scrambling trying to find my passport" Me: "Well that's alright, you can just call me or something some other time when you have more time" M: "Yeah maybe next Saturday, I think my plane comes back Saturday" Me: "Okay, have fun"  That is really honestly the just of the conversation, and I'm very proud for being nice and trying to bear no ill-will towards the BIG BIG JERK WHO'S A BIG MEAN MEANIE! *ahem* There was really no reason I needed to know he had been out Friday night, I'm sure it was a jab. I'm glad I didn't play the game and see who's having a wilder single life, and I'm not out to even compete in that game. He can have the club scene and I'll stick to the pub scene.
