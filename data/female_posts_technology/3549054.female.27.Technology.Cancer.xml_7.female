A boy thought for a while and said, "my choice is one really difficult question."          "Well, good luck to you, you have made your own choice! Now tell me this. "What comes first, Day or Night?"        The boy was jolted into reality as his admission depends on the correctness of his answer, but he thought for a while and said, "It's the DAY sir!"        "How" the interviewer asked.        "Sorry sir, you promised me that you will not ask me a SECOND difficult question!"        He was selected for IIM!        "Technical Skill is the mastery of complexity, while Creativity is the master of simplicity....."
