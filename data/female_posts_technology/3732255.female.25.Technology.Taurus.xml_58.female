Cal. club for puting on anti-pay-to-play shows. No band playing these shows will have to sell tickets. The venue is small, in the ghetto of downtown San Bernardino, and the kids are on the corner spanging for ticket money, but OAC Records wouldn't have it any other way. They are in the process of setting up anti-pay-to-play shows with other venue owners so stay tuned for more nights hopefully through out California. Pay-To-Play cause competition in the scene and turns it into a popularity contest, the band with the most friends gets to play the show type of crap. This creates an elitest attitude amongst most of the more popular bands. Punk is not an elitest thing!  urlLink www.punknska.com
