She doesn't understand his reactions.  She just wanted a little attention and yet it seems that he is too busy to give her any.  Maybe too busy with his own affairs.  Could she be selfish or is he self-absorbed with himself?  All she knew at this moment that she wasn't fulfilled or satisfied.  She was lonely and tired.  She just wanted a little bit company.  Is that too much to ask of him?  Maybe it was.  She would probably never know for sure.  Happiness is of the moment and yet in order to stay together it must be forever or else she would find someone who would give her attention and happiness.
