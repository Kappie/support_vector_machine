It was like the film "Last Night" where you know that the world is ending, and have known for sometime.  It was down to the final few hours, and you knew you were done for, but you had no idea how it would happen - disease, fire, pain, suffering??  I think that I would be one of the panicked people in an end-of-the-world situation.  Or I would become catatonic, living in a hole I dug in the backyard.  I've always been able to remember my dreams well.  I've also always suffered from nightmares every so often.   Oh, if you haven't seen  urlLink Last Night  then go rent it.   Now.   It's one of the better Armageddon films around.  Each time I watch it I am fascinated a little more and have more questions about one story line.
