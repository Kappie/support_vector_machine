I think that she is trying to share her feelings on the work that is required of her as a woman. I think that the ideas in this essay are trying to portray How she is tired of being the one in her family to do all of the work. I thinkthat a woman should be more than a mom and a nurse. The woman's job is becoming more flexible and less restrictive. I think that brady's essay is one that shows how she feels when all things are said and done.
