I ran across this quote today in my search for a greater meaning in life(lol) I thought that it represented the way I have been feeling lately..     Why do people continue to make the same bad choices they have made in the past?  Is it in our nature.  I truly believe it is....  Today for me is a very good day. I met a very interesting person the other day.  It is truly amazing how many people that I have met that I have no interest in talking with more than a minute and a half.  People that are just empty inside and have no dreams hopes and interest in what life has to offer...  And then there is a select few that you meet and they leave a lasting impression on you.  A soul that seems so intriguing that it seems almost impossible not to want to know them better...
