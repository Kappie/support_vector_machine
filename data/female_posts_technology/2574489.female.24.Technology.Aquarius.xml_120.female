My good friends from work, and yes, they are all guys (what do you expect in a tech support center?), are all going canoeing this weekend. I was not invited because I'm a girl. I'm so jealous! But yeah, after canoeing they're camping out, and none of them are bringing their significant others.  No girls allowed.  I hate it.  They keep talking about the trip in front of me and whenever I make a comment, B shushes me and tells me it's "guy's talk"...aaarrrghh!    Sometimes...and very few and far between..i wish I was a boy.  I am not a tomboy and have never been, but I get along so much better with guys. Not in a  malandi  *  way but in a totally platonic friendship way.  I have always been able to be one of the guys.  I am very unfussy, they can make their dirty jokes and I even join in sometimes(within reason), I don't get fazed by their "male" comments and talks.  I never did learn how to flirt which is a plus when hanging out with guys because I don't want to cross into that flirting friendship territory.    I have always avoided coming off as a flirt when it comes to guys. So go figure how I snagged my hubby.  For those who wonder whether girls and guys can really be just friends, yes, you definitely can.  It helps if the girl in the relationship has a secure SO.  My hubby is not the jealous type at all and trusts me implicitly.  I have even tried to get hubby jealous deliberately and he didn't(I will chalk that up to him being secure instead of him not caring).  But being a girl in a guy's circle leaves me out of some stuff.  Like this canoe trip! But we're supposed to go haunted house hopping sometime this summer.  I really hope that pushes through.  Okay, let me go back to enjoying being a girl.    *this is a Filipino word for flirtatious...yeah, that's it
