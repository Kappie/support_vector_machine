Unfortunately, it's out by the airport, so it's not convenient to anything too exciting, but the  urlLink view  ain't bad.  I was impressed that at any time during my cab ride last night on the way to the hotel, I was picking up no less than 6 wireless networks at any given time.  I doubt I'll see that any time soon in Nashville.  :)
