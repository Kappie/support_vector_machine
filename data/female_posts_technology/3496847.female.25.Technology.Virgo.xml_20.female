Then I stand, wet and naked, in front of the fan.  Not to sound kinky, but that is what I do to beat the heat.    The weather is supposed to break tonight - which means thunder, lightning, and rain.  But then it should be nice for the next few days.  My friend's bf is a subcontractor, so he will install my a/c for me, but I have to wait till it's raining.  He works 6 days a week if it's nice out. ****** I run in the mornings now, so the weather hasn't hindered my training at all.  I'm starting to enjoy morning runs.  I can't eat before them, it would make me sick, so now I have fruit juice and water before I leave and gum along the way.  More juice and water when I get back, a shower, then brekkie.     **Handy training tip** Chewing gum helps keep your throat from getting dry - just don't choke on it
