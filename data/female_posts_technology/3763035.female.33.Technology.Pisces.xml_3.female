We really didn't date because she said she didn't want too...So I had her move in within a month of meeting her in person.  We actually met after I moved to the Seattle area through her Ex-girlfriend.  I posted a personal ad to find a "Activity Partner" not a "Relationship Partner" and her Ex answered it. The reason why I posted it in the first place was because I was living with my Mother (big mistake) in Bremerton, and I was bored and so depressed.  There's isn't a large Out culture in Bremerton...To say the least.    Anyway, back the story....Renee's Ex-girlfriend (who she was still living with) answered and we started corresponding.  She gave me her home phone number and I called during the day and got Renee.  We talked for hours for several days.  Each time I called, Renee was home and her Ex wasn't.  After the second time, she asked me if I realized that her Ex was at work...I said of course and that I wanted to talk to her.  She has the most wonderful voice and really knows how to use it.  We read the same books, like many of the same things and connected on a very deep level.  I was falling for her over the phone.  We met in person with her Ex and one of my old friends at Gameworks.  She was so cute and shy.  We clicked in person as we did over the phone.  Within a month, I was able to find a job in Redmond and an apartment.  We moved in together and have been growing strong since.  She is my best friend, a wonderful lover and the center of my world.   As for kids, the only children we have is our two cats, Peanut and Fiona.  Peanut was originally Renee's but has become my cat when we all moved in together.  Fiona is the youngest that joined our family after my cat Bianca died.  Fiona likes my lap, but she favors Renee.    So, that's us in a nutshell.  I won't go into the drama of my family yet.  That will take another long entry that can only be confusing and cause many comments.
