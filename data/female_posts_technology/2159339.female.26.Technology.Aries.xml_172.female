Green Marble's friends brought over a load of  urlLink chicken from heaven  and what ensued was out-and-out chickentime. I saw R-dude munching on a piece, and I had to have one too because I could not talk and watch him eat it without drooling. While I was eating mine and talking to Z., she too was hypnotized and had to grab a piece for herself. A little later I saw XX eating a piece and he said, "Well I was talking to Z. and...." Thank you Popeye's Chicken and god bless.
