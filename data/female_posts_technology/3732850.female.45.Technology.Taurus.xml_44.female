She dated him for twoto three years. It seemed longer to me because personally I didn't like him from the start. He started keeping and turning her against family like we were the ones who weren't helping her. He tell her we were no good and she should stay away from us which she did. She paid $8000.00 dollars for a trailer house and within a six month frame period she had borrowed money from the bank and had nothing left to show for herself. She got away from him by moving to Grand Forks and met another guy not much better than the first. How can she keep meeting this men who are no good for her? He smoked marijuana and has been in jail and on probation numerous times. She has an eleven year old daughter from her first and only marriage. With the guy in grand forks she has a daughter and son which are a year apart in age. My niece will be two years old in septemper and my nephew will be one year in september. One was born the 22nd of sept. and the other, the 16th. There has been so much confusion and sadness. I don't know myself how to deal with it all because there is nothing I can do. Last year when my nephew was born, he tested positive for having meth in his system. My sister called me frightened and scared. I went down to Grand Forks where he was in the NICU. There wasn't much I could do. Social Services placed him in Foster Care. That is how it works when they are born in the hospital and family has no say. We did about my niece. My sister in the cities had come up to take her to her home for a while and then my brother had her for a while. Mysister went to treatment last year and in December she came to my house. She looked better and felt better than she had in a long time. I have a lot of ambivalance toward my sister and I did try to help.  It took a while but when I started school she had gotten back her kids and stayed with me in January, 2004 for a month. My mom lived four miles from me so I told her with my going to school it was too hard for me. I have a small house and my mom has an extra room so I asked her to go there. She threw a fit and told me I was throwing her to the curb when she needed me most. I know I didn't because she had my mom's place to stay. As I'm writing this, I found out yesterday that she had a bad U.A. I was shocked because she had been doing so well. My other sister who is thirteen months older than I visited her regularly. She had been on house arrest for three months and would of had it taken off yesterday. My brother and Mom went to get my niece because he is taking her so social services doesn't place her in fostercare. My nephew is going to foster care to the same people who had him before. They are the most wonderful people and have been there trying to help my sister and her kids. My niece, who is eleven years old is staying with her aunt because her dad is working construction in the cities. He comes home every week-end to see her. This is the same arrangement that was set up before. When she got into trouble before it was in the paper and of course people talk. My sister puts the blame on me for everyone finding out and this time I don't care. I'm so mad that I want to slap her and hug her at the same time. I feel torn. I feel hurt. I hated that I had to tell my two daughters about this. They both love their aunt dearly and I just don't know what to do anymore. I let my oldest daughter, who is fourteen years old stay there for one week to help out with the kids not realizing the dangerous environment I had placed her in. I wasn't thinking of that. I thought to help keep my sister off of drugs, known as crank, it would help to have her babysit the kids. Now I will not allow her to go there. Only if we visit and then leave. My sister isn't willing to give up on the guy she is with who is still in jail but will be getting out on probation shortly. What a messed up life for her. What I want to do is try to forget about all this and concentrate on my going to school and taking care of my own kids. This is difficult to do because in order to work out problems such as this one, I go to a counselor myself. There is no way I can deal with this on my own. My family gets mad at me because they don't want anyone to know. They are in denial and with it being in the newspaper, I don't know how they figure this isn't going to get out.  I cryed when I heard of this happening all over again. I hear people say that meth is the worse addictive behavior to have and it is hard to get off of and stay away from it. I guess she thinks more of her addiction than she does the life of her own kids.  I don't know what is going to happen but this time I would think she gets jailtime. I don't even want to have anything to do with her anymore. I love and hate her at the same time but she was given a chance and I can't see how she could be so dumb to screw it up again. You'd think she'd of learned from the first time of losing her kids. This time may be permanent placement and to tell you the truth itwould be for the best.
