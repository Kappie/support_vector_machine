Its 2 bedrooms, one bathroom, I have a washer and a dryer and a dishwasher and a fridge and I LOVE it!.  I can't wait to move in! I'm getting the keys next Wednesday and think I might just spend Thanksgiving day in my apartment!    I also got the pins out today.  It hurt.  A lot!  But I'm glad they're out and while I still have a cast, at least I know I am on the road to recovery!
