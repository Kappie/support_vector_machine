On Saturday night I ventured to The Hemlock to see Willpower and Anna Oxygen. I'd seen Will (Imperial Teen) before and he puts on a good show. Dance music and hot moves with smiling indie earnestness. He has back-up dancers who aren't any good, but very enthusiastic. I like them because they're sincere and look like they got the gig just because they're Will's friends. I've seen Willpower twice, and the dancers change. I want to be his friend! I want to be a back-up dancer! Also in the band is a shyguy named Tomo who mans the Apple Mac computer...  Quick! Trivia time! Name two other local bands I've seen who also have a Mac onstage! (Answers at end of post.)  Mid-set Will told the audience that Tomo's parents were there and they flew in all the way from Japan. They were standing next to me, smiling and politely clapping. I wonder what they thought of all the queers, because that night the room was packed with fags, fag hags, lesbos, hipsters, and me. It was a room fulla love and good energy and maybe some B.O. emitting from the pit of the tank-topped guy in front of me. I love Will cuz he has the sweetest smile and always looks like he's having a good time. And he makes good eye contact with the audience.  The person before Will was  urlLink Anna Oxygen  a supersweet energetic girl-lady from Portland. I'd read a great review of her record in Bust magazine, so I was psyched to see her. Though she's a fantastic girl, I didn't like her music though I really wanted to. It was too tinny and hollow electroclash for me; the songs seemed off-the-cuff and hastily constructed. I like hooks and there were none. She got the audience dancing in a hyper kinetic way but I couldn't get into her songs. There was a sheet behind her onto which she projected visuals that were unthoughtful and did nothing to enhance her show. A good idea, but a waste of the medium. She's a great singer, but her voice is mired in mediocre songs. What can I say, her art is amateurish and bland. I'm sure she's a wonderful human being. This review was hard to write because I really wanted to like her. I support her ideas--I just think they need development.  The opening band was called  urlLink Mighty Bells  and they were twee and wonderful. Kitty Jensen plays chords on her keyboard and sings in a girlish clear voice. Michelle Kline is on drums. The songs are simple and sad, like a lo-fi Azure Ray. Kitty was obviously nervous and apologized for it, stating that it was only their third show. Anna Oxygen sat cross-legged onstage, singing harmonies and the music was beautiful and simple. I bought their CD afterwards for $5 and it was a burned CD, which Anna apologized about. She also apologized because she didn't even have a pen to write down the name of the band. I told her I'd remember and if not, I can always look it up online.   All in all, a great show. It got me back into the swing of things, post-broken-heart. Boys come and boys go, but live music lives on. Viva la musica!  (Trivia answer: Gold Chains, Lovemakers)
