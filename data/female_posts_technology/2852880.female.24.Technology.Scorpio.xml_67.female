Today was a very good day.  It started out with a mysterious 1:1 I had with my manager.  He said we were going somewhere but wouldn't say where.  Turns out we went for a ride in his 1958 Mercedes 190SL to go pick up a basketball.  Then we came back to my building and shot around on the court outside.  What a fun meeting!  And we did do some talking, so there was some business aspect to it.  Sort of.  I'm pretty lucky.  I'm sure this isn't the norm for most workers of America.  Yesterday I had a bad experience.  I took this all-day class called Strategic Planning.  I learned a lot, and I'm glad I went, but there were these two guys in my group that were over-the-top argumentative.  They are the epitamy(sp?) of someone you do not want to work with.  By the lunchtime, one person left our group.  Before another hour went by, another guy walked away in disgust.  I would have left the table too, but I was hoping to make the situation better and finish off the class.  After having them talk  at  each other for 10 minutes or so and ignore suggestions from the other 3 of us, I suggested they couple off and work separately.  That helped a little.  They didn't couple off but they quieted down a little.  People like that don't realize how unproductive their discussions are.  Why repeat the same thing 50 times.  We heard you and we wrote it down.  Let's move on.
