I had grapes and an apple for snacks, and raw veggies with my lunch. For dinner (when I finally at at like, 9,) I had fish baked in tomato, red pepper, corn sauce. Yeah, I pretty much cook by throwing all the things I like together in a pan and seeing what comes out. After dinner I had a few spudz sticks and a few honeycomb. Mmm honeycomb. (The cereal, I don't keep bees.)      But my wow yesterday comes from what happened at the gym. So, as it was Monday and EVERYONE works out on Monday, I didn't get on an eliptical cause they were all full. So I hopped on ye olde treadmille and started to walk. Usually I walk for about five minutes and jog for  maybe  two, and alternate. (Yes, I'm that out of shape.) Well, I walked for just over two minutes, and then jogged for a full ten minutes. I'm not even kidding. I wasn't even out of breath, I just had to slow down because I got this funny pain in my back. (I'm assuming it was my lungs going "WHAT THE HELL??" Then I walked for a few more minutes, and then jogged for another...8 or 9 I think...I even ran for the last 3 minutes flat out. This might not sound like much for anyone else, but for me that's the equivalent of the New York City marathon. You know what else? I LIKED it. I wasn't going very fast, mind you, but it was still more than I have ever been able to do before. I could see myself becoming a serious gym rat soon, folks.
