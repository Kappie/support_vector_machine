When I later offered one to Wayne, he declined because he's "not really into muffins very much."  But he offered to eat the top.    This launched an entire debate about whether muffin tops were better than the rest of the muffin (his position) or if it's just as good all the way through (mine).  His argument, which is only mildly valid, is that the tops are where all the good stuff is, like the toppings or fruity chunks.  The muffins I had in hand had only a few more nuts on top, but were nutty all the way to the bottom, and softer at that part, too.  While I thought that this was absurd, he insisted that he's been to several meetings where the tops were eaten from the muffins and the stumps were left for trash.    One of us finally remarked that we were having a Seinfeldian pointless conversation, and it turns out that  urlLink Google  tells me we were.  There was a  urlLink Seinfeld episode  where Elaine and Mr. Lippman open a muffin shop that sells only tops.  When they give the leftover stumps to the local soup kitchen, they get nothing but complaints.  It appears that the homeless don't like the stumps either.    My solution is to get better muffins.  If any part of it isn't good, then it's not worth eating.    This whole debate worked out for the best, though.  Wayne and I concluded that if we ever have a muffin together, we can both eat our respective parts.  That's good enough for me.
