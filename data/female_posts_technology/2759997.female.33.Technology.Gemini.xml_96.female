Going to see a few sights tomorrow - I want to go see the  urlLink WWII Memorial , and whatever else time will allow.  Then, we're headed to Philly.  I have a date with an  urlLink Iron Chef .  Ok, technically, I have a date with Joe to go to the sushi bar at  urlLink Morimoto's  in Philadelphia, then we're headed to the  urlLink ballgame , then heading home Sunday.  And some time in there, we're having  urlLink cheesesteaks .  Yum.
