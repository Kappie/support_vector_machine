We won some points yesterday when Dan M collected all the tribe leader necklaces, he said it showed creatvitity that I tied knots in teh twine for several of my beads. I did not point out that I had to do that becase I was running out of beads and I needed to spread them out. We're supposed to send emails to compliment other people in the office. If you send an email "employee appreciation" comment to someone and CC it to Dan M, then your tribe gets 5 points and that person 's tribe gets 5 points. Of course if you do it within your own tribe, you get 10 points, so we should really get cracking. Now I'm being called in to a tribe leader meeting even though once again it is my lunch hour.  OK I'm back from the "meeting." Dan M handed each of us our teams' pumpkins, one each, and then explained "the company would appreciate it if you didn't carve it here." Which is to say for this office-related contest, worth 50 points to our tribe, the company would prefer we risk injury at home, rather than risk injuring ourselves at work.  The most recent email:   "Hello Survivor Members, we hope you are enjoying the competition.     Thank you to all who participated in the Pie Throwing Contest, some of you really got "creamed."   Updates:       Your Tribal Leaders have been given pumpkins for the carving contest.  Your Tribe has 24 hours to complete the challenge.  The pumpkin challenge is a HOMEWORK challenge, please do not do the carving during company time.  All Members of the office will vote on the best carved pumpkins, which will be displayed throughout the office tomorrow.  A voting box will be in the employee break room.  Only one vote per employee PLEASE!   The Quiz and the Brain Teaser challenges will take place tomorrow.  Sorry for the scheduling error.     The E-Mail Tag game has not been started for any Tribe at this time.  This challenge could take place at anytime.  This encourages you to stay at your desk.  For all of the Tribe Members who are NOT in the office, points will NOT be deducted for their absence.       Tomorrow is the Pot Luck, we encourage you all to participate, the sign up sheet is located in the break room.  Don't forget about VitalsWorks first ever - Mini Weenie Eating Contest.  Tribes, pick your best eaters.       Clue #3   Your objective lives within sight of yesterday's lead; however here is another piece of data you might need. It makes your task less complex, single sided or duplex, in this area you'll want to search next.     DanM"  I just tore apart both  copy machines in our office, both of which happen to also be near coffee stations, but I saw nothing unusual. Now I can see everyone else has the same idea as me. Now they're all dismantling and looking around both copy machines too.
