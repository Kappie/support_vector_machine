I start going to the gym last week on my way home from work and getting up and doing things around the house and with the kids, like swimming and going for walks. I don't mind doing any of these things. I quite enjoy them. The worst part about the whole thing is trying to eat correctly, or better yet change my eating habits. I don't want to diet because they never work and you always end up gaining back the weight. It must be a gradual change of eating habits. I love to cook, but don't have time. Fast food fits into our lifestyle way to easy. Tonight was my first night that I brought my lunch and am going to gradually try and bring my lunch more and more each week and only eat out like twice. So my mission is to loss 35lbs, go to the gym at least 4 times a week and to minimize my eating out for now.
