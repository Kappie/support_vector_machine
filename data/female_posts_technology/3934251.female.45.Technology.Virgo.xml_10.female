To get you up to speed we have 3 cats (Red Lester, Houditoo and Dandy), 2 gerbils (Will and Gareth), 3 fancy goldfish (Spot, Spot and Spot), 2 ordinary goldfish (Sam and Joe) and 3 minnows (This, That and The-other) - hey, blame the kids for most ofthe names.        Sam and Joe are my daughter's and live in her bedroom. This, That and The-other are my son's and live in his bedroom.   Will and Gareth live in the living room on the same shelf as Spot, Spot and Spot.        I looked over, as I said. Two of the stupid fish are floating on their sides. I understand this is sort of the equivalent of fish indigestion (something about dried food, fat bellies and gas affecting their bouyancy). The lovely Dandy is spread-eagle on top of the gerbils' cage. He is hard and fast asleep. The gerbils are a bit annoyed because they like to sniff the cats while the cats sniff them, but he's not playing because he's out cold. So they're running round like nutters making a hellish noise.        I went for my camera but the batteries are as responsive as Dandy. Oh well, there's always tomorrow.
