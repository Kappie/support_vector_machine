In a way, "Mi Viaje" has bcome my sanctuary of thots and emotions.    The REAL working world ======================= My boss encouraged us to sign up for courses to update ourselves. One of my fellow attachment trainee (A) was rather proactive in signing up courses. For the nature of our attachment, we should be getting more trainings. Initially we thought the manager will arrange and plan the trainings for us. However, we learned that we had to do it ourselves. This was only made known 2 months before the end of the contract. My fellow colleague (A) was kind enough to ask if I was interested in one of the course and consulted the manager for me, and another colleague (B). The manager replied that only 2 are allowed. So I told A that I'm willing to give up my chance since I'm not so keen in that topic. However, we were advised a few days later by our team leader that B and another senior engineer had already signed up for the course. I felt unjust and betrayed. It is understandable that B signed up before us but it is not acceptable that she was dishonest to A. When A had asked if she's interested, she should have told him that she had signed up! Even if she missed this chance, she could have told him when the email to ask the manager for permission was cc-ed to her! All this time she chosed to keep it to herself.   I knew she's 'fake'. On the surface, she's nice. (infact, she's particularly nice to senior staff.) But you can see that she has her reason to be nice. (bcos you are beneficial to her.) It's hard to work with someone like that. When you walk over to ask her qtns, her answers will always be brief. She'll not give you everything. Afterall, knowledge is power. It amazes me how one can acquire a skill like that when she's 24 and has only been in the working for at most 1yr. Oh well, maybe I'm wrong about her.   Disappointing ============== When I ask friends out for something, I often get rejected. Althou I'm always disappointed, I get over it almost immediately, on some cases. But as it accumulates, it's frustrating. Esp when the invitation list is not short. I thot it is a basic courtesy to REPLY to the person who sent that email? Isn't that the basic ettique? However, several times I had to ASK for a reply. It made me feel like I'm BEGGING people to come out and play. There's a reason why you receive that email you know? Are these people dumb or what?! I think institution have to teach them about nettique.   So I learn. I won't wait, I won't ask, I won't beg. The invitation is sent, and being an adult, you have the decency to reply if you are interested. Understood.   BUT!! Don't these people wanna have fun? It disappointing esp when you indicate its a gathering and put in nice words to hope they'll turn up. But you get, "don't know.. maybe I'll not come.. " "do what? huh? just that? err I'll think about it." LOOK, if you dont give a damn, you have the liberty to say no! I think all they could think of is themselves. Fuck them. I'll have my fun and pity them for their pathetic, insecure life!
