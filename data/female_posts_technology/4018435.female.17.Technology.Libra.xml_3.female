Ogre Battle 64 came in...I had originally planned on giving it to mike as an anniversary gift of sum sort....but I guess that's not gonna happen. I dont' even have an N64.    I told Kai and Bryan what happened. They knew i was looking for it for mike and well...yeah...the story had to come out. Kai told me how sorry he was for my situation cuz it hurts cuz it's just like the story he told me about an ex gf...her parents hated him because he was asian and they told him their daughter never wanted to speak to him again, then closed the door on his face. Afterwards they moved away in a week without telling him. She didn't say a word...meaning she never loved him... sounds pretty damn close to my story...     I played Tales of Symphonia today for a bit. Good game. After work I went to melanies to hang out with her and jasmina. it was great. we were throwing chocolate chips into each other's mouths and melanie kept shoving cookies into my mouth only to crumble all over her bed! Good times!   Tomorrow I'll be starting Karate again. What i need is to get my anger out on a punching bag. Thank the lords. After, maybe I'll see candice or melly. Candice and I are probably gonna sit back to a few sappy movies and have a few chugs of vodka this weekend. That's definately what I need.    So if I don't go anywhere this summer, my brother said he'd drive me to visit my friend in the states. Can't wait for that. *yawn* I'm tired...   Funny how I'm up late every night now just to write these. Wonder how long this'll last.    Looking for that light...   Still searching...   -Lonewolf
