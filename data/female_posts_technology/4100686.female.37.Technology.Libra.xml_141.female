I even considered making a squat claim on one of his old threads and turning it into a temporary weblog. Then I wondered if that might be stretching his accommodating nature a little too far. Anyway, here is a rehash of bits of recent conversation;   urlLink Dean  Esmay's  urlLink warwiki  has been created, and is showing promising signs of evolution.  This may prove to be an excellent opportunity for people who have argued both for and against war to finally come together and arrange their ideas without slinging insults at each other.  Even Dean concedes that;  "There are, I believe, anti-war positions that are thoughtful."  Ironically, this could be a small step towards peace, it is just too bad that while some of us are in the fortunate position of being able to discuss such things, there are people right now in Iraq who are not.   Anyway, it's fun to have contributors from different points of view bringing together facts in this way. It seems to put people on their best behavior, being careful about presenting facts, and even considering, if not agreeing with, each another's information. So far it seems to be developing a nicely weighted feel, serious, even perhaps a goodnatured undercurrent.
