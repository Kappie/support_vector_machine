I've given it some thought, and I think that my life would be quite different in one aspect definitely (among many others--but I will just focus on this one for now).  I would have more clothes, and shoes, and probably a more expensive car. But not necessarily savings, or a low credit card balance.  Because of him, my impulses to spend money on the newest fashion is tempered.  Everything is discussed, moderated, saved for.  We like to pay in cash.  He has a strong aversion to debt. The honorable school debts he hold is still like a spectre to him.  Without him, I would have answered that advertisement I keep hearing on the radio about a BMW 325i for only $200+ a month with the speed of a Porsche, never mind paying fees to break my lease with Nissan.  Everytime I pout because I can't buy that black sandals from Aldo, or another shirt from A or even Old Navy(!), or that new jean capri pants from Pacific Sunwear, I recall to myself the watchwords of my hubby: moderation, live within your means, and "what's wrong with the clothes you already have? Hehehehe....  I've called my hubby cheap in previous posts.  I still call him cheap, though its always in a joking way.  But living a debt-free existence is, I think, a more care-free existence.  True, I could gratify my impulses instantly with my plastic, and in that sense be care-free.  But that bill will eventually find its way to my mailbox, and then I won't be so worry free.    So cash it is.  Cash for trips (our whole trip to Morocco was all cash), for pleasure, unless its an emergency.  Cash...need to make more of it =)
