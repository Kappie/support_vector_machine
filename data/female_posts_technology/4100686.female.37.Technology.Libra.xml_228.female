Some commenters ask why some bloggers choose comment free blog formats, inappropriate commenter behaviour i believe may be the answer. There are many other options available for holding private discussions; email, chat and message boards spring to mind. What you do in your personal exchanges between consenting adults at other venues is your business. Please try to remain civil when commenting here.  Thank you.
