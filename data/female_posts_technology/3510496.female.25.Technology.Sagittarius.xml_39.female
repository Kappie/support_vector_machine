"  It was not a love at first sight  .   After a fallout from a major relationship, a few blind dates, she settled with 'The Aloof One'. Yes, that's her first definition of his character. She equates his quietness as a cold gesture. His main excuse to this day is, 'Why would I want to speak so much, when I am enjoying every single bit of moment when you speak.'  In another word, was he saying she is chatterbox? Well, she is still the babbling brook and he's the calm sea.   'D' Date : He was late! His apology statement was something like this, 'I was watching Godfather and the clock beats me in the immensity.' Duhh! They went to Madame Tussaud's to get in contact with the wax figurines. Had their peach sundaes in McD. Caught their first movie, a  urlLink    Bond installation. And 'fine-dining' @ Scotts foodcourt for some Tandoori spread. And did I forget to mention, the unshameful her actually asked him out on her 21st birthday? So of course, her being expecting her presents, got her presents from him.   'D' Presents : 1. A gold-champagne music box that still lay down comfortably on the dressing table and 'junked' with her favorite rings  urlLink    and brooches.   2. A Cat-figurine paper weight from Selangor Pewter still in its box, waiting to be located on the waiting for the right working desk in their new abode.   3. A birthday card with a shocked-looking Cat infront with his beautiful-handwritings-than-hers inside, that still sticks on her office partition behind her back.   After being 'an item' to each other, they dated 'abnormally' unlike other couples; they seldom meet, phonecalls mostly during working hours, and observe curfews on every dates. As other normal couples, they have their fair share of squabbles, quarrels, arguments and fights. They have 'Cat' fights  urlLink    (scratch each other), 'Dog' fights-No (they don't bark at each other), 'Laser Gun' fights (i.e. her 'laser' mouth equals sarcastic she).  They got engaged after one week he proposed  urlLink    that sent many awes and shocks to both sides of the family. Despite the one week notice, the results of the whole engagement event was quite an affair. Thanks to her mother! After that, they received 'warnings' from fellow uncles and aunties, that no repetition of short notices when it comes to their wedding.  Well, of course they didn't. They toiled nearly 6 months for  'D' Day  which bears beautiful moments  urlLink   . The Honeymoon. Beautiful. After one year. Still beautiful. And they hope in many, many years to come, more beautiful things will come in their marriage.  urlLink   "
