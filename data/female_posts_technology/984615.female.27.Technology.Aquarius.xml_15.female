Nuh-uh!! not me.   Okay, this was the plan - I was going to totally relate this great chat session that I had with a friend of mine "D-Love" but the text of it was waaayyyy too long to include here. I suggest that you read it - one of my new personal favorite stories - and TOTALLY TRUE! this Shiznit is better than fiction. (Life usually is anyway.)    So if you're cool enough to handle it - take a minute to  urlLink read this  and you'll understand why I am so  ABSOLUTELY  not cool  It gets to the nudity and the group orgys towards the middle of the story. (I always come through don't I - orgys and nudity - who could ask for more!) And I promise that I have at least 4 people to corrborate the story as absolutely true. (why would I lie!)  - chillin like a villian
