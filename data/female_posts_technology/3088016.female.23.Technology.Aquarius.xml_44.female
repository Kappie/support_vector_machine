They were reportedly posing for a picture with the big animal when he felt up the girl with one hand and the mom with another.    "Tigger" faced charges and was booked on $2,500 bond at the Orange County Jail, but interestingly enough, did not lose his job!  I guess that would have been politically incorrect.  A company spokesperson for Disney did report that he is on suspension without pay.    How bizarre.
