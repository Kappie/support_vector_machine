Of course it was predictable, but I bawled my eyes out in the beginning, especially at the part where her a#$ of a husband tells her he wants a divorce after 20+ years of marriage so he can boink someone 20 yrs. younger, and she was blind-sided.  Gosh, men are such scum!  Of course not everyone. My husband, and a lot of other people's husbands/boyfriends, are examples of thoughtful, caring, responsible men. I commend men who are raised in machismo society, or even is societies where women are considered second class, or are subjugated, and have risen above that.    My hubby is one such man. As much as I loved Morocco, it was painfully obvious to me that the majority of the men there were the bosses of their wives. Not naming names, I constantly came across men who did not allow their wives to own a passport so they can't travel, men who though they were too manly to change their baby's diapers, men who expected the women around them to pick up after their discarded beer bottles.  I told hubby in no uncertain terms, that I would never live in a country where women were consistenly subjugated, and where the religion and government condones and even promotes such subjugation. No matter what problems America has, I won't have to worry about having the men in my life (father, husband, brother) permission to make decisions.    But, like I said, my hubby did not become like the men he had grown up with.  He told me stories of waking up early with his mother, while the rest of the household slept, and cooking breakfast for her. When we visited Morocco, he would often get upset at him mother for not sitting down and relaxing, and instead was taking care of everyone's needs.  His mother is his hero.    I know that this entry stinks of feminism and man-hating. Its not meant to. Or if it is, I don't care. It's my blog, right?  But I don't hate men. Not the good ones anyway.  ***  Sidenote: I read a really great article off of Time Asia online about the growing rate of divorce in Asian countries initiated by women.
