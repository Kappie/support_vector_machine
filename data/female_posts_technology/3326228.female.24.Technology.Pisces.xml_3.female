He was one of her people, and they consider each other very precious because there have always been so few of them.  I could never feel sorry for him. Symone has also mentioned my "gift". Its hard to describe it really. A feeling from out of nowhere that you have no reason to feel. I always thought while I was growing up that I was just too sensitive. My parents believed I had an over-active imagination. I would cry for no reason, or feel pain which had no medical explanation. It wasn't until I was older that a government scientist told me I was an empath. That was after I'd volunteered to become one of their "problem solvers" and they decided to "enhance" all of my inborn abilities and talents. But I'm going off the subject here.  What I'm meaning is that no one who could have felt even an echo of that girl's pain and fear would be sympathetic at all to that young man's death. Yes, he was apologetic at the end- even despairing of what he'd done. But apologies and despair will never give her back her life. Her emotions cling to me still, like a soft gray fog drifting in the back of my brain. They'll dissipate with time, but the memories of it never will.  Symone says I try not to feel because I feel too much. Maybe she's right. But no matter how strong I believe I am, I am not strong enough to ignore the panic, fear, and despair of the world around me. I don't really understand how anyone could not feel these things. They seem plain enough to me.  I won't tell you that its all bad. And I don't tell you this for your pity. There are plenty of other people who deserve that more than me. I get to use this strange talent of mine to help save and avenge hundreds of lives a year. Good times get amplified as much as bad. They just don't seem to last as long.  Sometimes, when the job's been particularly tough, the three of us will rent a cabin in the middle of nowhere where all of us can truly be ourselves. We stock up on plenty of food and booze and play pool, or sit in the hot tub, or hike for a weekend. When the good times get going and the laughter is bright, that's when I feel like I'm lucky. Lucky to be where I am and lucky to have great friends.  Bah! Now who's being sentimental? What's the moral of my story? Another bad guy dead. Another life avenged. Another win for the good girls.  Well, maybe "good" isn't exactly the right word...
