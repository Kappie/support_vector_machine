After sharing so much of my personal life with a girl that was supposed to be my friend, I came to a conclusion that she was really not my friend. When I told her about my relationship with this married man, she told me that was not right. I didn't disagree with her but I didn't stop what I was doing. I was still seeing this man. She was always listening to me talking about this guy and being kind and friendly. So, I thought I could count on her by telling her who he was. It was my mistake for telling her about my situation because this guy, who I will call BS from now on, told me to not tell anyone about our case. He is supposed to be a good guy, a family man. Well, I had promised him not to say anything to no one. Well, that was not so, I told my girlfriend about him and she didn't like to know who was because she knows him and his family because they are from the same town. I should have known better to not tell her about us. Shoot! Now she knows and I could be f***** up.  Too late now. I went on telling her about my relationship with BS and she was just listening. But when I felt like I was being left out, she would tell me that BS is not for me and that I should encourage him to go back to his wife and kid. Yeah I know that but what she didn't care is that I love him and didn't want him to go. She was always telling me that he would regret and that it happened to her daddy and that nowadays her daddy regrets all he did. Her father was seeing another woman while still married to her mother and her mother was pregnant at the same time this other woman was. So, my friend see that I am going through the same situation and that I will regret. She sees me as a woman destroying a family. Now you see what a friend she is. She told me that I was destroying a home and that it is not right. I didn't destroy anything. It was his decision to leave his house, not mine. It was his decision to separate his wife, not mine. Yeah, I should leave him alone and encourage him to go back home, but he said he is not going because he doesn't love his wife anymore and the only reason he would go back is his daughter. I know he loves me and I love him too...but now I don't know what to do...  My supposedly to be friend is not talking to me anymore because she told me I am doing wrong and that she doesn't like that and that her other friends don't do things I do. Well, like I said before, she feels like she is Ms. Perfect. She doesn't lie. She doesn't do anything wrong. Bull crap! She does all the lying and wrong indeed. She just try not to repeat them by correcting them. Well, I am not correcting my doings because I believe there is no correcting the past. I believe there is doing better now and today. I will try not to keep repeating them. Plus, it is my life. All I wanted from her was her opinion and friendship about my situation, but she felt the right to do whatever because she said I brought her into my business and this gives her rights to take an action. The action she was going to take was to call BS and tell him all that she knows. Now I ask you: What does she has to do with that? I told her it was not her business to take an action I must take. It makes no sense to me to take another's person action. It is my business and she must stay out of this. She has no right to call him and talk to him. How come? I have never seen such situation. It makes no sense. What you think? Did she have the right to do that? I believe that when your friend is in a situation like mine, the best thing is to advice but not stir it up by saying things or acting for your friend. You don't touch other people's mess. Stay far and let's things cool down. I believe that.
