I like the Hobbit theme, its so familiar, simple, and cheerful.  I also like the theme of Rohan, in particular the parts with the fiddle.  But I also like the metallic, percussion-type music that plays when the orcs are around.  The Hornburg is also a beautiful song, as is Forth Eorlings.  I think that I have come to the conclusion that I like all of the music.  Picking a favorite would be like...like...picking a favorite child (if I had any) or picking a favorite book.
