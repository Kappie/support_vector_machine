        With the Asia Cup kicking off the Indian cricket season, Star Sports/ESPN seem to be hell-bent ontransforming cricket into a masala package which appeals equallyto the non-afficionado. While the idea itself may hold some merit, the implementation leaves much to be desired.         Don't get me wrong here. I am not averse to Sunil Gavaskarstraining his vocal chords to hum, ' Barsaatmein... tak dhina din ', pondering with a wink and a naughty smilethe various connotations of  tak dhina din . Or for that matter, Harsha Bhogle squirmingin his seat, whileShastri andAkram wax eloquent about apretty face in the crowd. Must say, Harsha must be credited for still managingthat wide-toothed grin of his, inspite of his discomfiture being quite evident whenever the conversation strays beyond the non-controversialtopics.       But when the pitch reportconsists ofanother former cricketer plodding down to the pitch,acting as a doctor, accompanied by a busty bimbo as a nurse, I start getting nostalgic about the good old days,when cricket matches and commentarydidn't neednoodle straps to 'shoulder' them. The same wistfulness makes it way to the forefront when I am made to forego the actual action,the live telecastinterruptedevery now and then to tell us what the stars have in store for a particular batsman or bowler.         Or the Shaz  Waz show.I completely fail to understand why would people want to voteto seetwo middle-aged men leer at wide-eyed, oh-I-am-soooo-excited-to-be-on-the-show-and-ooooooh-was-that-Yuvi-who-just-passed-by PYTs, cooing half-witted inanities?And if the ideais to getmore and more people hooked on to cricket (officially called 'widening theviewer base'), then a better idea would be to have hunks on theshow (now thats athought!).The men anyhow watch cricket for cricket, dont they? And I dont thinkfawningoversexy females is going to earn other female eyeballs.
