Even though I was exhausted from a long week, we were able to have a lot of fun in a little time.  The  urlLink hotel  is one of the most spectacular buildings in the city - definitely worth a visit, if you're ever in town.  Tell Frank, the bartender, I said hello.  :)   urlLink Sushi  was wonderful...  we even got to see the  urlLink Iron Chef  himself.  Joe and I were the only people at the sushi bar, and he walked out of the kitchen and was standing 6 feet from us.  I smiled and nodded (my bad attempt at a bow), and he did the same.  We didn't get to see him in action, but he stood there watching the 5 sushi chefs VERY closely for several minutes.   urlLink     urlLink     Then we went to the  urlLink game  and saw the Phanatic and the new park and had a  urlLink cheese steak  and the Phillies won.  So we went back and saw Frank.  :)
