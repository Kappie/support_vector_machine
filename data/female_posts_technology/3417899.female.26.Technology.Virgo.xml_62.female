If I were to look at our table from a distance, or evesdrop on our conversation, it would have resembled a variation on a scene from "Sex in the City".  "So, what is the definition of dating? If you go on two dates but don't have a third one set up - are you dating?" "Guys like the damsel in distress, you should let him show you this, explain that, feel like he is helping you" "This woman on craigslist wrote that she and her husband have sex 10-12 times a week and asked whether it was normal" (gasps and laughter).  Eating, laughing, sharing funny stories (of course, I must have mentioned my blog at least 10 times, being the addict that I am).    [I don't remember having this much fun or feeling this comfortable with female friends growing up. I guess now that I am, ahem, an adult - and happily married too - that competitive nature of mine is no longer in the way of enjoying the company of girls. I wish I had discovered this sooner...]    Our waiter was the epitome of Mr. I'm-A-Smooth-Operator-But-Am-So-cute-I-Can-Pull-It-Off-Without-Seeming-Like-An-Ass type of guy. extremely good looking, sweet, funny - a true gem. Right away we ambush him: "Are you single" (yes) "How old are you" (31) "What do you do" (Sing, work at the restaurant) And so on. His last name is Kid. First name is Rodney. It took me a few minutes to get the joke. Rodney Kid. Rod - NeyKid. Rod Naked. Smiles, laughs, innuendos.   Mr. Naked is taken with J. He tells her she's pretty. Then he tells her again. And again. He thinks she is beautiful.  We play out the game for them - write J's number on his notepad. Make him promise he will call her and take her out. He does.  Whenever he stops by - he's got another cute flirt for her up his sleeve. We embarrass her a little bit, and him a little bit - but it's all good.  He will call her and they will go out.   Just like that, without too much preparation, or expectations - J has a date with an oh-so-hot guy.  I watch this courting process from a spectators perspective and think to myself: Would I still want to be there? Am I jealous?  I think about this on the ride home and realize, as fun as that seemed, and as flattering as this was for J, and as exciting as the dating game can be - I am lucky to have it in the past.  It's the means to an end . Sure - the "means" can be fun and have a great body - but the "end" is going to bed at night and feeling loved and safe and never being alone and sharing your heart and loving with all you can love.  And the end beats the means. Hands down.  And yet, as much as I truly mean everything I had just written, I wouldn't oppose some Mr. Naked telling me I am pretty every now and then :-)   I'll be waiting to hear if J's date with Mr. Naked turns out to be a really great "means" with a quick end, or the real, ever-desired "end".
