If you don't own a turntable, then you won't be able to listen to this... but hey, maybe it's time to go get a turntable! The first pressing will have a limited-run on colored vinyl, it's still in the works but it most likely won't be more than a few hundred copies!  RED LIGHTS FLASH "Free..." CD - A-F Records' first international signing, Austria's RED LIGHTS FLASH earned their spot on the A-F roster thanks to alot of hard work, non-stop touring and a commitment to making the world a better place. If bands like Strike Anywhere, Hot Water Music and Good Riddance make your heart beat a wee bit faster... then "Free..." is for you! The next issue of AMP Magazine will feature a track off of "Free..." in their sampler, a song entitled "Saving My Time"... it'll be hitting newsstands everywhere in early August!   Coming October 19, 2004:  ANTI-FLAG "A New Kind Of Army" reissue - A-F Records will be reissuing "A New Kind of Army" this Fall, as an exclusive A-F Records release. For those of you having trouble finding this CD in stores, fear not... it'll be available again very soon!  ANTI-FLAG "Death of a Nation" DVD - Recorded live at varius shows over the past year, "Death Of A Nation" will feature exclusive live Anti-Flag footage, behind-the-scenes of the making of the "Turncoat" video, and a whole lot more that's still in the works. For our debut DVD, this is guaranteed not to dissapoint!   In addition, A-F Records will be releasing THE VACANCY's full-length CD in early 2005!   Via  punkunited.com
