I had lunch with Ernie and Greg. Ernie told me he will miss hugging me and the smell of my hair. I will miss everything about him. Great friends are so hard to find. He sent me his latest story today. I hope he makes it one day. He is as good as any writer I have read.  Greg said he would take me to Seattle. Now, that is an interesting offer. I don't know about Greg. I know he likes me. Our friends seem to think we should make a go of it. He has a good head on his shoulders and I know he would never hurt me. Maybe I shouldn't be so lofty about love and just give in. Perhaps loving is a process that one can learn.   My sister is coming July 4th weekend!! Yay! I can't wait. I have plans for the whole weekend. I hope it rocks!!  My head is still buzzing from work. The effects of being a code whore. I have to work on my side project this weekend. Archie has found some time. Imagine.  Enough - I'm numb.
