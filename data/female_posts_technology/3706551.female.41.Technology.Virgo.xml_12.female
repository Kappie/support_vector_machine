Our idiot neighbors across the street were shooting off bottle rockets  Roman candles over our house. The cats were freaking. Since my husband does not allow the kitties inside the house (don't get me started on THAT one, girls), I SLEPT OUTSIDE ON THE BACK PORCH WITH THE KITTIES. They snuggled up on the comforter  slept soundly through the night. Not only did my husband not get any pussy, but I guess that also makes me a  urlLink CRAZY CAT LADY .
