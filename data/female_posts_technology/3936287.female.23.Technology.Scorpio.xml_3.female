We went to Universal, Magic Kingdom then Epcot.. and me and my friends did that for just 3 days.. Well this is what happened.. first day.. Universal, everybody is excited, we took pictures everywhere and rode all we can.. then the next day.. Magic Kingdom.. still so excited, but we are a bit tired already, it so nice there though, brought out the little girl in me ( well i'm always the little girl though) and even make me believe that maybe, maybe, dreams do really come true if we make a bit of effort and have courage to pursue it.. Hopefully they do and maybe someday too, I'll find my own prince charming, just like all those fairy tail princess... and guess what we even had breakfast with Cinderella.. hehe.. last day.. Epcot, boy we are all tired.. and all we want is to get it over with.. haha! It was fun though.. I learned how its it to become an astronaut ( well maybe I'm really destined to be one).. hahaha, but nah.. i like it here on earth, thank you.. but really we were so tried that we wish we have our 'yaya'  with us.. i wish for a yayo though.. or maybe a syota???? haha.. well gonna stop here or i might say things i don't want published.. haha.. urlLink
