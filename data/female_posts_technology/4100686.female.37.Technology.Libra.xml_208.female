Her's is also the 50th Iraq blog linked here.  Always wondered how long (if ever) it would take for younger bloggers from Iraq to begin forming networks with each other and start developing their own teen audience. (Although some bloggers and commenters revert to the age of 13 the moment they hit a keyboard, which has it's good and bad points i suppose). Good luck Raghda, hope you keep posting in your own language too.  New Today; 1 Total; 50!!!
