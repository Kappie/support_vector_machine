In Pine Valley with the gauze covered, scenery chewing, fit pitching rock-heads, thick necks and anorexic neurotics. What sort of a nickname fits you? Iced cherry cola? Grand master lite whipping cream in peach syrup? DJ jazzy vanilla crepe? And child, who is dressing you? Find out which dresser Boyd, Anna and Lena blew and “take a meeting”. Steer clear of whoever is dressing Kendall, Liza and Mia though (I’m thinking somebody lost a bet). Or maybe the whole “I refuse to let any specific clothing company say they dress me so I am forced to wear the same dreck everyday” line of fashion popular with Ryan, Aiden and Tad’s putz son is more your style.  I just don’t know. I have become weary my little Bo Derek braided cupcake, I will ponder your dilemma(s) later.  Juan Pablo?  What is your damage ? You are so not from Argentina. White trash from France? Possibly. Former cabana boy from Key West? Probably. And claiming that you and Carlos are brothers is preposterous. That is like saying Shannon Doherty and I are twins! Sure, we’re both surly white women but similar bad attitudes does not make us related. I’ll buy Bianca as Erica’s daughter and if I’m drunk and squinting even that Greenlee is the offspring of Jackson. And I know the name of the show is  all my children  but come on people! Is it too much to ask for a little genetic continuity? Perhaps you could say you were brothers from different mothers. And from different fathers. Brothers of the soul? Yeah, that’s it! Why do we have to say Juan  and  Pablo? Is that like your version of Mary Alice? Bobby Lee? Tiffany Amber? Should it be hyphenated in print? Should it be hyphenated in my mind every time Mary comes listing past for a drink and squeals your name?     When MTV first started showing the real world my sisters and I got hooked. But it was only entertaining for 10 minutes so we would play this game where we would re cast it with people we knew who were tons more entertaining than the actual real world cast. Anyway, that is the premise of today’s game. I’m recasting AMC but have decided I need a theme. What fun would it be if I could recast with anybody in the world? (Well it might be funny but I have a theme damnit so that’s how this is going to play out.) I am limiting my casting choices to celebrities from the 70s. Not the way they are today, in 2003 (if they are in fact even still living), but the way they were in their shiny, bizarrely fashioned, oddly coifed 70s prime. I might be using their real names or their character names.  I know  the actors’ names but it will have more impact in some cases to use the character name. If you need to know the actors’ name(s), ask me later.         AMC Character	New Disco 70s replacement	Comments (oh you  know  I’m going to have comments) Erica Kane	Cher	Well Cher was always going on about how she was so put upon (you know, gypsies, tramps and thieves) and her daughter ended up being Lebanese too Bianca	Kristy McNicol	Yummy. And wait till you see who’s playing Lena Kendall	Marcia Brady	Marcia and Kendall? They are both far superior than the rest of us Jackson	Michael Landon	Pa Ingalls was just as thick and lantern jawed as Jackson.   Mary	Lynda Carter	It would be written into her contract that she would have to wear the wonder woman bracelets in every scene she has with people she is in conflict with. Which is to say, every scene. Even when she is just ordering a drink, there is a conflict.  Greenlee	Tantum O’Neal	Bad haircut, big eyes, surly and belligerent-a perfect match. Reggie	Chachi	Would Greenlee love Chachi? I believe so. Juan Pablo	Donny Osmond	Casting Donny and Erik as brothers makes more sense than the way they have it cast.  Carlos	Erik Estrada	Plus, Donny and Erik were way cute. Maggie	Cheryl Ladd	Don’t know if Charlie’s littlest angel can pull off being a completely clueless dope but I can live with Cheryl Ladd giving Kristy McNicol “hugs for support” all the time Lena	Kate Jackson	See? How fabulous is that? Kristy and Kate,  oh yeah.  Boyd	Leif Garrett	I toyed with the idea of casting a female as Boyd but Leif was just as pretty as a little girl and none too bright. Except for not being quite gay enough, this is a perfect casting. Ryan	Jan Michael Vincent or Michael York	While both Jan and Michael were 70s tousled hair beautiful (unlike Ryan who is a lump) their acting skills, which consist of a lot of furrowed brows and mouth breathing, are perfect for the role of Ryan.    Anna	Olivia Newton John	Oh nice one! See how I replaced one accented hottie with another?  Aiden	Rick Springfield	And even better, another accented one replaced the nephew of the hottie. This choice is also very ironic because while they were pushing Rick hard to be a teen idol in the 70s (he even had a Sat morn. cartoon show for flip’s sake) he never really hit big until the 80s.  On a soap opera! David	John Boy Walton	All that sensitive whining and the dopey 5 o’clock shadow made this a perfect match. Tad	Dick Van Patten	A Dick playing a Tad? Oh that’s good. Is 8 really enough to fill your world with love Dick? How about you Tad?  Tad’s putz son	Vince Van Patten	A real life father and son playing a TV father and son. I am good. And Vince was a beautiful boy. The god of all 70s mouth breathing beautiful boy actors. Edmund	The Captain	The Captain would have to learn to speak on occasion but… Maria	And Tennille	Tennille was just as damn perky as Maria ever is. Myrtle	Charo	This really makes no sense but how funny would that be? Mia	Jan Brady	So that the heads filled with rocks, anorexic, trying to catch a man story line could continue. Really the only difference these 2 would bring to the show is longer hair to flip and fling Simone	Laurie Partridge	 Mary	Suzanne Pleshette	Yeah, I know I already did Mary. But then I got involved in a conversation recently about Suzanne and she would be perfect too. Who wouldn’t want to see her and anybody else listed here in a finger shaking, eyebrow waggling, deep voiced growling, slap fight?!    Whew! Well, that was really fun. I know I left out some good Characters (Liza, Opal, Val etc.) but I couldn’t really think of…. Who am I kidding? I was tired. I promise to someday write an actual “update” but every time I get ready to do that I end up going off on tangents about gauze covered lenses or fashion sense or scenery chewing.  Maybe I will do another replacement casting. Only this time I will replace all the characters with characters from saved by the bell, 90210 and full house. Or something. Teehee, enjoy ladies. I was considering sending this to Vicky as well thinking it wouldn’t really matter if she didn’t know whom the AMC character was, only the amusing ness of the 70s replacement. But then I remembered her pop culture is zero.  Oh, Julie your (coke whore) cruise director as Liza! And Paul Lynde as Val. And Carol Burnett as Opal.  (Just like that. No comments though)
