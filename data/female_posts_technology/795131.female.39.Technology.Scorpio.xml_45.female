Much of it is from before my time but I wonder if I get old-people points for remembering: -My favorite Boston album on 8- track tape. -Card Catalogs at the library. -Gigantic tv antennas on top of everyone's roof, the owner of which risked his life to set up there, and had to risk his life (and it was usually a HIM) every time it needed to be re-adjusted.  ":)  -----Original Message----- Subject: FW: How old are you?    HOW OLD ARE YOU? My Dad was cleaning out my grandmother's house and he brought me an old Royal Crown Cola bottle. In the bottle top was a stopper with a bunch of holes in it. I knew immediately what it was, but my daughter had no idea. She thought they had tried to make it a salt shaker or something. I knew it as the bottle that sat on the end of the ironing board to "sprinkle" clothes with because we didn't have steam irons. Man, I am old.  ******************************************** How Many Do You Remember??
