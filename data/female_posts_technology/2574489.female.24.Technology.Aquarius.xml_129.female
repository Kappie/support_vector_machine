So I've been having these cravings for Japanese food.  I don't even like sushi with fish! The most I can take is crab meat.  I can eat the vegetable sushi though, and California rolls are yummy too.  And shrimp tempura, teppanyaki(sp?), yeah, I'm gonna visit a japanese restaurant this weekend.  Hubby prefers it to be a Japanese buffet though.     What's everybody's plans this weekend?  Whatever it is, enjoy and be safe!
