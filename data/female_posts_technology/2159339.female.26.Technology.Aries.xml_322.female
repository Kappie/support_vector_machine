See, last time after class a group of us went out drinking in the Mission and after a few beers and a lot of getting-to-know-each-other, I said some things that might have been misconstrued by my lovely fellow classmates. There was something about me getting horny during the final exam season in college and also something about my dog licking my mouth and accidentally tongue kissing me. I don't remember the context exactly and hope they don't either. A few of them said some questionable things also, which I will have to recall in case they use my dog story against me.   In other news, my hair has passed the 'short' point into 'medium'. This is the longest I have gone without cutting it (myself or by a coiffant). I am determined to grow it long and noone can stop me.   One of my brother's letters to the editor was published in a major Bay Area newspaper. He's pissed because they cut out all the funny commentary and made him sound like a total bore. He won't tell me how many other letters he has written.   Batty forwarded me a link for this personality test. Although I don't necessarily like my assessment, I must admit it's accurate (except for having learned to channel my energies into improving my intellect):   urlLink Personality Quiz Link   And here's what I got:  You are an SEDF--Sober Emotional Destructive Follower. This makes you an evil genius. You are extremely focused and difficult to distract from your tasks. With luck, you have learned to channel your energies into improving your intellect, rather than destroying the weak and unsuspecting.  Your friends may find you remote and a hard nut to crack. Few of your peers know you very well--even those you have known a long time--because you have expert control of the face you put forth to the world. You prefer to observe, calculate, discern and decide. Your decisions are final, and your desire to be right is impenetrable.  You are not to be messed with. You may explode.
