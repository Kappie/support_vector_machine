I would have probably handled things the same way that the author did. The author was raised in a "upper-middle-class black family" which tells us that life was different for him than other black people from the start. The author did not hold the resentment, anger and frustration that many poor black people hold. He did not have to fight for everything he had. Because of his social class, the author was not angry at all white men. He did not feel the contempt for the white man that the other black soldiers did. He felt like he was an equal to the white man which is why he did not fight back when first attacked. I think the idea the author was trying to convey was that he almost felt ashamed for not fighting back in the first fight. He questioned his response to the fight wondering "Was I less of a man for not having beaten my attacker to a bloody pulp?" Self-defense and active and defiant fighting back were the two reasons the author feltthat fighting back was justified. He felt that "fighting back" for the black man and other minority groups was a "statement of individual potency and self-determination." The author understood that by not fighting back, he had disgraced the entire black population. In the authors second fight he did choose to fight back. I think he fought back because of all the guilt he had harboredfrom disgracing his people years ago and also, he was probably more aware of the discrimination that his people and other minority groups experience after serving in the military. He had experienced life other than the upper-middle class life he was accustomed to. I found that I had great respect for the author admitting that after his second fight, he felt a "great sense of hollowness." Even though he was justified in retaliating and initially exhilarated by the fight, he did not like that he had become like the "others" and learned to fight back. What a good lesson that fighting never solves problems. No matter what.
