The stranger stared at the holy man for some time, causing the man to feel that his head had become transparent.  THEN I WILL ASK YOU A SIMPLER QUESTION. HOW DO HUMANS FORGET?  'Forget what?'  FORGET ANYTHING. EVERYTHING.  'It . . . er . . . it happens automatically.' The prospective acolytes had turned the bend on the mountain path. The holy man hastily picked up his begging bowl.  'Let's say this bowl is your memory,' he said, waving it vaguely. 'It can only hold so much, see? New things come in, so old things must overflow–’  NO. I REMEMBER EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING. DOORKNOBS. THE PLAY OF SUNLIGHT ON HAIR. THE SOUND OF LAUGHTER. FOOTSTEPS. EVERY LITTLE DETAIL. AS IF IT HAPPENED ONLY YESTERDAY. AS IF IT HAPPENED ONLY TOMMOROW. EVERYTHING. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?  The holy man scratched his gleaming bald head.  'Traditionally,' he said, 'the ways of forgetting include joining the Klatchian Foreign Legion, drinking the waters of some magical river, no one knows where it is, and imbibing vast amounts of alcohol.'  AH, YES.  'But alcohol debilitates the body and is a poison to the soul.'  SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.   - Soul Music, Terry Pratchett -
