"That's all there is.  That sentense was written by me a minute and a half ago and you read it only forty seconds ago.  That's to say, my writing and your reading correspond to different moments in time, but on that piece of paper 'now' and 'now' are undoubtedly the same 'now'.  Therefore, on the one hand the sentence is true, but on the other hand it lacks all validity.  Or is it the concept of time that we're failing to take into account?  Don't you think that's a good example of a paradox?  I can see you have no answer to it.  Well, you'll find the same problem with the enigmas posed by my Van Huys or by anything else.  Who's to say that your solution to the problem is the correct one?  Your intuition and your system?  Fine, but what superior system can you count on to demonstrate that your intuition and your system are valid?  And what other system can you call on to corroborate those two systems?  As a chess player, I imagine you'll find these lines interesting."       The player too is a prisoner      of another board      Of black nights and of white days.       God moves the player and the player the piece.      But which god behind God begins the weft      Of dust and time and sleep and dying?  "The world is just one vast paradox," the old man concluded.  "And I defy you to prove the contrary."
