I questioned, cried, shrieked, and shivered. I cursed, prayed, reflected, and understood. No man could endured the journey.  The pain no man could withstood.  He came and took away our sins Through his sufferings. He spoke and told us the way Through him to God.  This is what I believe We serve the same God. In our own different ways. There's your belief and mine.  So respect each other. Love one another. Live life with love.  For we are loved.  I can go on and on But I have to sleep now I have to stop talking like this Or I'll go on and on.
