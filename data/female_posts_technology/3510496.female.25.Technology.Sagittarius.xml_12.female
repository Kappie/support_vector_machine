After sending the message, I did some sweeping in our bedroom   and kitchen. I was tempt to vacuum, but I guess that would shake the whole of block 528.     Still can't blink off. I played boring games from my hp, then I played 'Bowling' from hubby's hp. Surprisingly 'dead log' hubby was awaken by that. Funny. He could be lulled to the louder sounds of the radio  . And complained to the harmless tunes from the hp games.   On the top of my head, this could be the work of the vinegar. No good. My insomnia days suppose to be long over. I don't want to revert back to those days where I had to make doctor visits to 'beg' prescriptions of valium/lorenpazam for the sack of beauty zZzZzzz.   I managed to doze off a little while though. A short one but with a still-fresh-on-mind reverie  . In that dream, I met a fellow blogger, and she clearly mentioned to me she was a FIREFIGHTER  . fu-wahhhhh... Guess! Guess who is the lucky blogger. Siapa betul dapat hadiah!     Back about insomnia, I just feel like relating to one movie   I'd ever watched from the cable channel.  Dream for an Insomniac . Many would rate it as a 'weak-plot' movie. Fans of Jennifer Aniston could see her in her early days (though she's not the main character). Basically the story tells about a dreamer who can't sleep (insomniac). She leads a lonely life until she meets the boy of her dreams. The boy happened to walk in as a new employee in the coffee house she works in.   I remembered on particular 'sweet' scene, the boy actually offered to accompany her whole night, spent chatting. But 'sweet' enough he dozed off. She was on high hopes to hitch with this sweet boy, especially after having impossibly high standards for her love and fears that will never meet a worthy man. But was undaunted when she discovers he has a live-in girlfriend. Thus she made her way to LA, with her friend (Jenifer Aniston).   The ending was all sweetness. She finally locked in a 'hearty' sleep  . Shhhhh ... I won't tell you how she manages. Go and check it out on VT/VCD/DVD yourselves. Exactly, the 'remedy' my GP ever mentioned to me. Hihihihi ....
