Ok, I got a miserable  urlLink hang over .  I have no one to blame but myself.  It's the result of 4 - count 'em - 4  urlLink Cosmopolitans  at the  urlLink Amsterdam Bar  after the  urlLink Zoni Awards .  I am sorry to report that the husband didn't win but several of our friends did.  It was fun, we were dressed to the 9's and it was worth it to see the drunken gay men try to pick up on my husband.  Of course, my state is not conducive to wanting to answer phones today and hear people whine about their computers.  Ah well, such is life.  I only have to get through today and tomorrow then have my vacation.  Good thing.  I guess I can't blame my age for not knowing that much alcohol would give me a raging hangover as they are now saying that  urlLink Menopause is not tied to forgetfulness .  There goes a perfectly good excuse - dammit.    The one shining spot in my otherwise foggy morning was reading that  urlLink Gen. Wes Clark is tied with pResident Bush in poll .
