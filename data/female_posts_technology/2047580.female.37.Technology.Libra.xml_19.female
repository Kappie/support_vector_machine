Why women can't put on mascara with their mouth closed?      Why don't you ever see the headline "Psychic Wins Lottery"?   Why is "abbreviated" such a long word?   Why is it that doctors call what they do "practice"?   Why is it that to stop Windows 98, you have to click on "Start"?   Why is lemon juice made with artificial flavor, and dishwashing liquid made with real lemons?   Why is the man who invests all your money called a broker?   Why is the time of day with the slowest traffic called rush hour?   Why isn't there mouse-flavored cat food?   When dog food is new and improved tasting, who tests it?   Why didn't Noah swat those two mosquitoes?   Why do they sterilize the needle for lethal injections?   You know that indestructible black box that is used on airplanes? Why don't they make the whole plane out of that stuff?!   Why don't sheep shrink when it rains?   Why are they called apartments when they are all stuck together?   If flying is so safe, why do they call the airport the terminal?    My favorite is "Why isn't there mouse-flavored cat food?"
