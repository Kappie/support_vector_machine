(my boss is jewish.)  it's so loud up here. i hate it! i need a new job. i used to have the mail cube behind me. so i never heard anyone... they changed it to someone's cube. these people are all inside sales people. i hear fake happy people (and real happy people... which is just as annoying) trying to sell... shit. make it stop!!!!! and their phones ring off the hook... my boss is lucky i like him so much. otherwise, i'd be outta here!
