Work is good, I am rated 10th in our department (out of 62) for my stats (call time, volume, resolution, etc) and I am rated first on my team (14 of us). Not bad for only being there 6 months! Mid-year reviews are coming up. I've been told by my supervisor that I have nothing to worry yet of course I am still anxious to hear what he has to say. And while I am not first in our department, of course my head tells me I should be. One of the things about working in a call center is that so much of my performance is based on concrete numbers. Number that while I may not agree with the formula for calculation, because everyone is based on the same formula, there is no denying the good or bad in them. Numbers of course aren't the only measurement of success there but they do play a hefty part.    My reputation at work is such a far cry from what it used to be at Apple. Same work, same environment (in a sense) so its easy to compare the two. Apple was my first corporate experience. I must say I was pretty hard headed about learning how to work and play nicely in that type of a setting. I had an awesome supervisor though and when I got out of line (which was often) she told me. As much as I hated to hear it, she was always right and because of those lessons, I am where I am today. The supervisor I have now is a gift from God. Literally. He used to be a pastor so its nothing for me to ask him to pray for me if I am having a bad day. He *gets* that a long with a ton of other stuff. He can read people and their reactions and know where they are coming from. He understand my need for perfection even while disagreeing that I should be perfect. He understand that all of us are human, subject to all the stuff humans go through. Its been a great experience there. And I seem to be on track for a good career there should I keep my current actions.    I have requested information to go back to school. My company will pay for it, I need it and I want it. Of course, I am scared to death to think of it but I think it will be good.    Freedom is still Freedom. Ever wondermous and my best friend. His allergies are in full swing but other than that, he's healthy again. He's losing the weight we need to get off of him and each pound we lose, I get another couple minutes added on to his life.    Home is good. Our garden is flourishing. We have all kinds of tomatoes (at least 3 different types), squash, watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew, corn, Chinese eggplant, green beans and bell peppers. Some we started from starter plants, some we planted from seeds. Its just amazing though. Its so cool to go out to the garden and harvest stuff and then eat it knowing that it was something we grew.    So.... work is good, Freedom is good, home is good. Not a whole lot to complain about these days.    And that feel great.
