I told him it was an oxymoron.  Is it really?  Or is it just in my life that sex marks only the beginning of a relationship?    My mother decided that I am "grown up" enough to discuss these issues. She told me she misses my dad and she needs the intimacy.  I cringed.  They've been married 30 years. And they STILL have sex.    I bought the book "The sex starved marriage" (by Michele Weiner Davis). Maybe in it, I'll find some insight on why my marriage to my husband is sex-less.  God knows I love him. More than anything.  But when our marriage became "real". Reliable, stable, caring... sex became extinct.   A therapist costs $170 per hour. This blog is free.
