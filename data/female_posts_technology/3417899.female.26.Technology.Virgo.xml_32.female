I don't think I ever realized how many clothes I have. dozens of pants, hundreds (!) of tops.. enough clothes for 5-6 people's closets. Granted, not all of the clothes fit me anymore. Some are too small, some are (believe it or not) too big. Yet, the amount I have kept around is unbelievable.   I also noticed I have many clothes I have not even worn once. Clothes with the price tags still on them. I counted 9 shirts, 5 dresses, 4 skirts, 11 pants, 2 jackets, 1 suit. All brand new and never worn.   There's no point to this blog, really. Just an admission of waste.
