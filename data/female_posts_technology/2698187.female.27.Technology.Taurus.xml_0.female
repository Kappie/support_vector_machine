I wouldn't mind just hanging out around here, watching movies all day, just spending time with myself. Minor depression will do that to you.  I hate when I feel this way. It's like my lonlieness just envelopes me. It's overwhelming. How do you become happily single? I want SO bad to be. Really I do. I want to be enjoying my single years...flirting, dating, falling in love, falling out of love. But I'm not. I just feel like there's so much I've missed out on.  I know that a lot of my sadness is about Derreck. I still have not heard from him. Don't know what that's about. I guess I have to admit to myself that I am in love with him. Against my better judgement. You can't control that though. I think that's the difference between loving someone and being IN LOVE with them. Loving someone is a choice. Falling IN love just sorta happens against your better judgement.   I meditated today and the message I came away with was to BE STILL. I am going to try my damndest. I know God has it under control. He has it planned and I'm meddling in his business. But I can't help but to ache with lonlieness. I know deep down that no one can fill this lonlieness but God so I should be seeking Him.   On another note, I am pondering starting to see a career counselor. I know that I want to make a move by the beginning of next year for sure. That way i can enjoy another year of AWS, hopefully have 6 mos experience with a content management system, and have steady employment for the condo purchase. Three years at a job with no upward mobility in sight is long enough. I just don't know what exactly it is that I want to do. So I am going to get some help, get focused over this year. I think that if I get into a job that I actually give a shit about, that will give me some purpose. Make me feel somewhat better. My job isn't half as bad as some people's. But I'm no longer interested, I don't care about half the stuff that goes on around there and that's not right. So it's time to go.   I need at least one thing in my life to look forward to.
