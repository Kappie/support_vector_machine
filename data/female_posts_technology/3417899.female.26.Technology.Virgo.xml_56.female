Needless to say, the program did not work - despite my futile attempts to incorporate the words into my daily business conversations.  You can hardly fit the word "capricious" or "sedentary" into a discussion on the benefits of mobile software and the sales negotiations that are my daily routine. Even more frustrating is the fact that the majority of the words in the CD are not even minimally challenging (come on, do I need a CD to teach me the words "struggle" or "negotiate"??!?).  I fell for the marketing hype.   I should have learned how to  golf  instead!    Update:  Here is a new approach. I'm recruiting you, my loyal readers, to my quest for a better vocabulary. Know of a "power" words/word I should be using? Let me know!!
