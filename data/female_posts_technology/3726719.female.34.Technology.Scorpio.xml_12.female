The roomie locked his keys in the house yesterday, so I had to leave work, go back to the house, and let him in so he could go to work. So glad I'm not the only one susceptible to blonde moments. Anyway, it was a good morning - I look pretty in pink today.  There was something that bugged me on my drive in today. This man came barrelling out of nowhere and cut me off at a stop light. Then, when the intersection was cleared, he just proceeded right along. Did I forget to mention that THE LIGHT WAS STILL RED!!!!!!! I thought the guy was a real jerk. Evidently the police officer proceeding through the next light ahead of him didn't even notice. Sigh.  Anyway, there has been some work going on today. I've been working on a business requirements document. Lots of information to impart in a short period of time. And I'm not all together focused on it.   I feel like my time has been stolen away from me. It's my own fault really. Between meeting lots of people and spending lots of time walking on the greenways, I feel like I have no sit down time. I haven't spend an evening on my couch cross stitching and/or watching television in ages. I miss being able to sit still.  The online dating process is exhausting. Checking messages, sending e-mails, trading instant messages, and scheduling "meet n greets." It's funny that the times I wish I had someone to go out and do something with seem few and far between when it turns into all my time spent searching for someone to be with! Guess it's just one of those bizarre life things.  And I had a male friend make the statement to me last night that women "want what they can't have" in response to my question of why the men we are attracted to aren't attracted to us. I think I got a bit uppity in my response to him. The statement just seems like a cop out to me. For example, I'm attracted to a male friend. I asked him last week if we would be interested in sex on a regular basis. My only reason for asking this question was because we have had sex together on 2 occassions, and it was good. My thinking is, we're friends, and the sex is good, who wouldn't want to do that more frequently. I was turned down. Fine. I'm not pining away for him. I still like him and think he's attractive. I've been given the impression that he still thinks I'm attractive. It hasn't stopped me from seeking out someone else to spend time with. Yes I was embarrassed and felt foolish after asking. I'm still friends with him. Nuf said.  The attraction I'm talking about is so much more than just looks. Another example. I've meet 5 men recently. All of them nice. Each not grotesque looking. Great conversations. Only 1 has the potential of being an "attractant" and all indications are he's attracted to me. I guess the big difference between men and women is that (and I'm using my roomie as a reference), when men meet a woman in person, they are driven entirely by looks. If her butts too big, it doesn't matter how good the conversation is, she's not interested. Where as I, using myself as the female example, have met and had great conversations with several men. Dispite not being attracted to them all, I don't have a problem with continued conversations and potential friendships.  I'm rambling. It's just something that bugged me.  The thing really bugging me this afternoon is food. I've got crazy munchies and feel like I could eat 24/7 and still not get enough food. CD says it's cause my metabolism is turned up because of the exercise. It's a good thing....except for this whole wanting to eat more side affect! That's the reason I'm having to exercise every day to begin with!! :o)  Someday, I'm hoping to get back to stitching. I miss stitching. I miss having all the time to stitch.  I'm going to walk now. I'm thinking Sonic for dinner!!
