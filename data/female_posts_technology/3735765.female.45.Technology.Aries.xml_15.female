I will be sharing these posts with you on the upcoming posts.  I hope that you will enjoy and share the excitement that I felt as I embarked upon this new journey! :))    MOTHERS' DAY!  -- a day of rest for me  a day of joy talking with my daughter.  (Note: Remember to bring her back something red or blue.)
