Since the day I was born
Never had a chance
Where is my happiness 
Who are my friends
Where is my family
Some say they understand 
When they don't have a clue
Looking at the reflection
Fuck you 
I don't need you and don't want you
Anymore
This feeling has been here from the beginning
It will never go away
The older I grow 
The stronger I feel
This pain taking over me
