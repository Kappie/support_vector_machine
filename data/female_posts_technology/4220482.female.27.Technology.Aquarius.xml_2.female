Ha.. :) As usual, I continue to design Dorothy's AAD brochure (so call lah!) Carolyn showed me someone's picture - printed on paper... Promised her not to mention... Bi Zhi entered the Helpdesk room.. Then followed by Shan shan.. then followed by Pei Ting... follwoed by Wan Qi.. followed by Sec 1 students having problems with their tablet PCs... followed by time's up! Time to close the Helpdesk and go down to TA office.. Still designing the AAD brochure... made some changes here and there... Finally, can showed Mrs Lee... Dorothy went to show Mrs Lee... I went to Boon Lay to give my cousin tuition... I really don't understand at all.. Why all Normal Tech (NT) students behaviour is so sucks.. attitude is sucks... discipline is sucks... I told him to memorize the formulas for Areas and Perimeters... 30 minutes of revision.. and then gave hime a test.. Nothing! He learnt nothing at all!! All he knows is to play, eat, watch TV... etc I said I am not teaching him anymore... I called his father, my uncle that I am giving up.. I am going to stop giving him tuition... See how he survive on his own.. I wait for his call.. if he calls me or SMS me to go back and teach him, I also want to re-think... Just finished redesigning the back page of AAD and checked through the things.. Everything seemed fine.. But still got to go back on Saturday to work... got to go and sleep.. bye bye
