From 11:15 on, I was not able to access the internet, and by early afternoon, the network was disabled, and they finally closed the office at 4:15.  I, of course, stayed until 5:00.  Not that I could get any work done, but I was encouraged to go through the 7 boxes under my desk that have been there since I moved upstairs last year.  The good news is, I'm down to 2!  Judging from the lack of e-mails on my blackberry, I'm guessing they're still trying to get things back up and running.  But today is Peach's birthday outing.  She's kind enough to let me use her computer as I'm sipping my mimosa and we're preparing for our day.  I showed up at her door earlier with champagne in tow, to find we must have received the same memo on dress attire - not identical dresses (mine's embroidered silk and hers is linen), but identical style and colors.  At least we can tell each other apart - she's the blonde in the hat!   We're heading out to lunch then going to see  urlLink From El Greco to Picasso  this afternoon.  I'm looking forward to it - especially since this is the tour I *just* missed when I was in Denver this past January.  Plus it's my belated birthday present to Peach - so we have a rare girls' day out, which will be fun (I guess that's as opposed to the frequent girls' NIGHTs out - if you consider "out" playing trivia at E - which can be fun as well).  And Sunday.  For the first time since I don't know when I get to have my favorite Sunday morning coffee, paper, mimosa, crossword ritual.  Then I think I'll stop by E and catch a game or two.  :)
