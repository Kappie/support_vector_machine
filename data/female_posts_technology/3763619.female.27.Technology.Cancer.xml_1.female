On the other hand, how disappointing is it when things don't go the way you expect them to on your "special" day.  Why do we think that people are going to change the way they normally are and suddenly become the most thoughtful, wonderful people ever?  Are we really just setting ourselves up for disappointment by having such expectations?  I think I am glad my birthday is over.  Only 364 more days to go until the next one.
