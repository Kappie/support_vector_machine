"what exactly do you do?" is usually the question people ask me when i tell them my job position. so i will explain for the umpteeth time, just so everybody knows. my company supplies environmental information to the commercial property division of real estate and to other environmental companies throughout the united states. we are soon going to be expanding to all types of real estate, including residential. what we do is go through our data bases and give them all kinds of info.  i myself work in the Sanborn Map Dept. i research maps throughout the years, a span from 1867-1996. these maps show actual streets in many towns and cities in the u.s. they show all of the places of business on each street in each town. take manhattan for instance. we can supply about 20 maps of a two block radius anywhere in manhattan. these maps will show each residential apartment building, each store, each metal shop, each gas station, etc. it's really quite interesting to see how much an area has changed in a span of 100 years. when you look up my house on our maps, it shows that there is nothing there because the most recent maps we have of stratford are from 1968, and my house wasn't built until 1977.   so i have a pretty interesting job. it's the structure of the company i don't like. we recently moved to a new building, and since then, everything has changed. we were a very laid back company before the move. they warned us that they would be changing some things once we got into the new building, and we thought we were ready for it. we were wrong. it is an entirely different company, extremely anal and nitpicky, trying to weed out the undesirables by making the workplace uncomfortable. it's a sad downfall, in my opinion. why make all of your employees miserable just to get rid of a few idiots? they don't want to fire them because then they have to pay them unemployment. if they quit, they get shit. that's how shady my company is. every week, there are new amendments to the dress code, some being extremely ridiculous. case in point: we are not allowed to wear flip flops (or thong sandals for those of you who don't know what flip flops are) or berkenstok type sandals. ok, we won't wear them. we now got an amendment stating that we are not allowed to wear any shoe that sounds like a flip flop. what! almost all of my shoes sound like that. most of the women in the office have the same problem. so we just keep wearing them. i don't have the time or the money to go out and get a whole new wardrobe for work. we can't wear jeans, capris, carpenters, cargos, or painters monday through thursday. on friday, we can wear all of the above except painters. why? i have no idea. weird shit like that. supposedly someone got fired a few weeks ago for not following the dress code. yeah, ok. is that really cause for dismissal?   ok, i think i'm done bitching. i have the tv on in the background right now, and they are televising ronald reagan's funeral. there are tens of thousands of people there. i just saw nancy reagan go up to the casket to say goodbye, and my heart broke for her. they were married for 52 years. how sad for their last few years together to have the black cloud of alzheimer's hanging over their heads. i grew up during the reagan era. as a child i didn't know the difference between democrats and republicans and their views, etc, so i remember revering reagan. he was our president. we should be proud. living during part of the cold war, i remember reagan taking those first steps with gorbacev. i remember soon after his presidency the berlin wall coming down. i remember his speech after the challenger explosion. we were taught that he was a wonderful president and that we should believe in him because we were americans and we got to vote for our president. there were many countries who didn't get to vote. they had a dictator, who took the reigns by force. so we should be glad and rejoice that we get to pick our wonderful leaders in this country. this is what i remember about the reagan era. were the teachers trying to make themselves believe all the crap they fed us? i'm not really speaking about reagan, but about the two bush men we have had in office. should we be proud? they seem to have broken more than they have fixed. should we be grateful for all they have done? reagan managed to help end the cold war. for that, i am grateful. bush and bush have stuck us in wars we have no business fighting. but i digress. today is not about father and son bush; today is about a president i did respect, and about his wife, whom i also respected. i will pray for them and their family.
