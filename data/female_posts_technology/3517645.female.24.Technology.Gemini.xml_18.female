Of course my mom ended up going, but we only spent two days with her. God we just can't go anywhere or do anything without one of our family's tagging along. Don't get me wrong I love them and everything, but it is like we are still kids and can't go anywhere alone.    We did the whole tourist thing starting in Niagara falls and then going into Toronto. We went to the playdium ( a big arcade), CN Tower, Canada's Wonderland, the Zoo. We also visited with my cousins for two nights and just relaxed and then headed to Peterborough to visit a friend from high school and his girlfriend. Madison had her appointment on Wednesday. It went well. Everything is going as expected. She basically has back all the movement she is going to get with her arm and hand. She can still get stronger as she uses it more. As she gets older she is learning to figure out how to complete more and more with her right arm and hand. The doctor did say there is a surgery that could be done, however it will not help her function at all but it would rather be just for appearance and place her arm in a neutral position and she would look "normal". So that is a decision that we will have to think about. Next year when we go we are going to meet with the surgeon that would do the surgery and see what he has to say about it and get all the information.    The kids had a blast during the trip and it was a really quick and tiring week, but we fit everything in and we were glad to be home to have a good nights sleep. That is our trip in a nutshell.
