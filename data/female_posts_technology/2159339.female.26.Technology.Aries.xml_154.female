We went to the Yeah Yeah Yeahs..Karen was sexy as usual with her hot pants and the sparkles. Batty  I talked about the versatility of her hairdo. "One haircut, five exciting looks". The funniest part was when Karen O. said something about the next song going out to all those who are in love and in unison, Batty  I went "Boooo!"..as everyone cheered. Not even "Psssss", but  B  fucking  OOOO .  XX and M were standing right behind us.   So I totally sleepwalked last night. I thought there was a squirrel in my wall and I was trying to coax it out. When I realized that I was actually sleep walking, I went to the bathroom and washed my hands casually, pretending like that's what I meant to do all along. M followed me, probably to see what I would do next so he can laugh about it later. Whatevs. He should be happy I didn't sleep-punch him in the ballsack.
