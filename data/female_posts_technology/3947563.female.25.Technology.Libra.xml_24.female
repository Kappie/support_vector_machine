Today I had a subway turkey sandwhich - six inch, an apple and crakers and cheese forlunch with cereal for breakfast. I plan on have salad with chicken for dinner.   I've brought my gym bag with me to work, so I'm not going home until I spend 30 minutes on the elipitcal and 30 minutes lifting weight.   I can definatly say I was disappointed in my self last night when I ate all the mashed potatoes in front of me. I would like to work on my restraint a little more.   You all sound like you're doing really well on your diets. I'm going to step the notch up a little more, which means no more buttery mashed potatoes!   I also will have to get in three more workouts this week. One will be rollerblading, the other two will be the gym.   I know I'm going to get in trouble if I dont' get my four workouts in....so I'm motivated to get through them. ;)
