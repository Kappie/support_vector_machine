Holy Jesus, arrest me, I am criminally insane:  Wed -- The Unicorns @ GAMH -- I'm excited about this show because they're a new band, but their album blows my mind. It's a delightful-edgy-beautiful-pretty-heartstring-tugging album that is sweet and quirky like The Flaming Lips, angular and bouncy like Hot Hot Heat, and with melodically prominent basslines like The Cure. The singing is sometimes soft and whispery like Elliott Smith, sometimes resigned and thoughtful like Grandaddy, sometimes frustrated and loud and yelpy like Steve Bays/ Robert Smith.  The album is tinged with an overall child-like charm and earnestness like the Langley School Music Project but with an adult consciousness. (Example: my favorite lyric: "Somewhere in the asshole of my eye/")   It's also a little Thriller by Michael Jackson in one song that has a comic-creepy Vincent Price-like voiceover. The album is wonderful and I'm hoping the show will be too.  Thursday -- Detroit Cobaras @ BOTH -- I have never heard them. I'm going because the Von Bondies like them and so does Meg White. It's already sold out! I have a feeling this show is going to be good.  Friday -- The Stills @ The Independent -- I saw them at Popscene last year, and they opened for Echo  The Bunnymen, so why is this show being promoted as their "Bay Area debut"? I was divided between this show and seeing Neko Case at Bimbo's, but The Stills won because it's 8 bucks cheaper. And it's closer to my house.  Saturday -- Communique @ BOTH. I'm dragging XX to this show with me. The headlining band is The Wrens, whom I've heard lotsa good things about. I'm going for the opening band, Communique, who are quite good. I like bands that dress in all-black and have solid dark dirgy music with melodic basslines(Interpol, BRMC, Communique). Though this formula seems idiot-proof, some fuck it up and make it a mockery, like one godawful band called MADELIA who are unintentional parodies that make shitty music. They're all posturing and artifice and are generally a horrible superficial band that do not rock. And they're serious about it! No tongues in cheeks. I've had the misfortune of having to see them twice. I left halfway the first time, and the following time I saw them take the stage, I ran for the door.   The great thing about living in San Francisco is that all the bands I love come to me. Even if a band is doing a 7-city American tour, they always hit SF. And I don't have to drive from fucking, like, Monterey to see them. Everything's just a bus ride away, so in regards to bands? Life is good.
