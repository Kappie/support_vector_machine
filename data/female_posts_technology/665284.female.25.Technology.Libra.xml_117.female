Disappointment creeps in when a friend expresses desire to leave the country because the Philippines is this and that.  Not that I wouldn't like to go abroad. Am I living in a bubble? Inside looking out? Seeing, not experiencing? All I know is that If I die out there, I'd want to be taken home.  A lot of Valentine contributions to 2BU has been published and out in today's paper.  I haven't read all of them yet.   Pam Pastor's  article contains traces of "My Sassy Girl". I requested for a softcopy.  Kapal ko noh?  I was not able to bag that section of the paper for further reading e.  Speaking of  My Sassy Girl , I met my nth lover yesterday.  Kwong Sang-woo!  PAPA! *me like Motosuwa-kun with a nose bleed*  A sticker of Bugs Bunny and Lola is stuck on the window of the right passenger door. Bugs is naked while Lola wears a sleeveless top and shorts. A lot of thoughts here like maybe Bugs is genderless and why can't Lola be naked. She could've been drawn without breasts. Just stick a ribbon. Whatever.  Oh, yeah.  Why do most conversations tend to lean toward matters of the heart when V day is approaching?  What started out as a request to configure an AS400 connection ended up in  "Ok ka ba?", "Masasabi mo bang OK ka?", "I'm loveless" .  I just listen and say "Yes, I'm generally okay."
