She knows that he is a depressive person and that we have been struggling..not personally but with finances....and what does she do?? She drags him in the middle of her and his dad.  I love my mother n law very much....but I hate to see my Husband treated that way. I was so worried about him last night.  I was afraid he was pushed tooo far last night.  He doesnt realize how much I worry about that and it does make me angry when I see someone who knows about him ... to push him that far....  I am also upset that she talked in front of the kids the way she did.  Brian and Austin told me that she yelled at them to be quiet when they tried to talk to her when they were at their Dadaddies. And they both asked my what a WHORE was.  Because she kept saying that in front of the them that their Dadaddy had his whore in her house.  I wish the kids would of never went over there.  I pray to god that Brian doesn't go to his mothers house and say what he heard.  We have fought so hard for him that I pray nothing ever happens to turn the judges decision around.  I know she is hurting and I do understand.  But I pray for now on that Ken and the Kids do not get stuck in the middle.  I never knew I was capable of loving someone as much as I love him. They also say that you cant love a child that is not yours as much as you do your own...that is  a LIE.....I love Bri - Bri just like if I was the one who had him.  Well I guess I should stop writing,,,but my mind is so full....and I am so scared and worried about my husband right now. I have been praying ever night that God takes special care of him to help him through all of this.
