But this dream was so vivid. It was unreal how I could feel myself walking, talking, moving through space. Through a space that I have never been in before, nor likely will ever see. It is possible that it was just my mind trying to re-hash old memories, but at the same time it was more than a memory. My senses were involved to the point that I could smell the musty room, I could tell you now in explicit detail the colors of the walls, the feel of the carpet under my feet.   It was more like a premonition of what I'd like to have happen. But I'm not beyond saying that I've had dreams like this before, and they were premonitions about specific times, places and people. I normally don't subscribe to "sixth sense" BS, but it's been happening to me more and more frequently. It was especially odd when I "knew" that I'd meet one of my very best friends before I ever knew of her. It could explain how we became such good friends so quickly. hmmm.
