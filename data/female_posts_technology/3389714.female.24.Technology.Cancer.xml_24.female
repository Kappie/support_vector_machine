I guess u just gotta deal….   Question of the Day   What’s more important having great sex in a marriage or having a great tunnel for communication?  I think communication is far out more important cuz hell when u’re 80…I don’t know if the sex is goin to be that good…if your able to communicate freely..you can get a bit creative…and being 80 wouldn’t even matter…wink wink…
