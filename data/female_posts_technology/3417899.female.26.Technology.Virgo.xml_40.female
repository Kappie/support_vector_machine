Work is x; y is play; and z is keeping your mouth shut." Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955), Observer, Jan. 15, 1950.   I've never been too good at Z. Yet - I'm quite successful. Am I the contradiction to the Einstein's rationale?   I think this formula lacks some of the factors which affect success:  q is charisma r is tact s is demagoguery t is sheer luck  The formula would be A = t*(x + y + max(z, q+r+s))
