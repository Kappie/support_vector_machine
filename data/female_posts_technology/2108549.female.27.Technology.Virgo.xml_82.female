I got all kinds of stuff from M.A. too!  Curtains and sheets and towels and silverware and and and...  :)   Muchly loved stuff.    I have been doing a lot of thinking as I am a bit burnt on the radio and well, I don't know.  That's it I guess.  I don't know what I don't know and I don't understand what I don't know.    Very tired.  Tonight is gonna be an early one.
