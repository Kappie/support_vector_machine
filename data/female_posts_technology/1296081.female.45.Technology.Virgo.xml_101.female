 urlLink "24" is  on tonight.  Can't wait.  Of course that means I will devote the hour  before   "24" to watch that insipid  urlLink "American Idol" .  I swear, I don't know how I let myself get caught up in that crap.  I swore after last year that I wouldn't let it happen again.  But NOOOOOOOOOO, here I am back for more and discussing with friends and coworkers who needs to get voted off.  I swear, it's an illness.  But "24" always is good and riveting and I look forward to it every week.
