And our neighbor with 6 children says she only received thirty four dollars total, instead of the 400 per child that the newspaper keeps saying everyone is going to get! Tuesday night at 11:15 we get on an Amtrak train and ride for about 36 hours to Pasco Washington. How we'll get from Pasco to Yakima, no one knows. Probably rent a car. We'll be at my mom  dad's for a week, leaving the following week on Wednesday night. Of course, staying at my parents' usually meant carving out a niche in the clutter and ducking out periodically to eat at Burger King a lot . I'm glad we're going. Last time my parents saw my 9 year old daughter, she was 3, and they've never seen my 4 year old son at all. And my kids will get to ride on a train  see the Pacific Northwest the whole way!
