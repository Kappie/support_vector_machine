Not mentioning my own problems...         So what happened today? I hung out with Kelly of course! Good ol Chief and me went around town today. She got her helix pierced and we picked out a few things for her new place. Yeah...i talked about how much i loved interior design. I showed her where i got my new bed sheets (that I'm planning on using in my new room) and we chose out a small comforter. Then when we got to her place we picked out colours for her walls so we could paint them. She has THE coolest bachelorette pad ever! I want a place like that sumday! Well, single or not single. It's a really great place! We sat around talking about guys and what we've been up to lately. I really really wannt go clubbing with her sum time but no...I'm not 19 yet..Haha oh well, I'll live.         Okay...so once again jorel's car isn't ready. The part they needed got delivered late so it wont be ready till TOMORROW...damn...taking too long...the kool part is, they're cleaning the car out even more and they threw in a 300 dollar stereo system as an apology for it being so late. Pretty nice eh? My dad even liked the car when we stopped by to see it today.         I've been having a hard time breathing lately...who knows what it is..I need to refill my perscription...         So tomorrow I work, I'm hanging out with Kev and we're going to look at desks and stuff for my room, and then I'm going with my mom and my bro after work to pick up the car...I hope...stupid thing took so long! *Cries* hahaha. the car is sooo kool...         Yep...I can feel success in the palm of my hands. I wont let anyone take that away from me. I promise to dedicate all me success to all thsoe who ever put me down in my life. I don't know what it is...I've been thining abotu it a lot lately. I have to keep believing in my dreams in order to make it somewhere. I have to make my own choices and listen to my heart. I have to want to change and to live and to see two sides to everything in order to come up with a decision, a point of view or an action...yeah...lots to think about lately.         Almost been 3 weeks...hmm...my grandmother seemed fond of josh and she didn't even meet him. She just asked me who he was and said that he seemed very mature. I'm glad. Taht's a good sign. No weird questions or anything like that.         guess I should go to bed already...need to heal my breathing...                         One's actions reveal their true self. That's why he ran...he showed his true self...heartless...    -The Lonewolf
