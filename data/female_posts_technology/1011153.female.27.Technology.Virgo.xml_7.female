I am, believe me, but you have to understand that the past few weeks and the next few weeks are full up.  There are plenty of nights where I get 5 hours of sleep because I'm busy doing things I must do (and there's precious little reading or watching TV going on), then the next day I'm shattered because I only got 5 hours of sleep.  Fitting in half an hour of running, while technically feasible, is not always an incredibly attractive option.  Cycling, however, is a happy medium.  But I have been afraid to cycle recently for two reasons:  1) Last October, running + cycling really made my knee hurt.  Running was ok, but cycling actually caused my knee to react so badly that I couldn't run anymore.  2) My chain is rusty.  I've been running (if you can call it that) for a few weeks with no bad reaction from my knee at all, so I thought tonight I would give cycling a go.  On closer inspection my chain wasn't too bad (though I probably should replace it), so I braved it.  Because I haven't cycled in a while and I was worried that either my knee or my chain would break, I didn't go too far afield, and only did half an hour.  It's not particularly hard work for me, even on the hardest gears, and it's an excellent opportunity to make my left leg work harder (because I would estimate that my left leg is only about 80% as strong as my right leg now).  We shall see how my knee reacts, but I'll probably be cycling more if it's ok.
