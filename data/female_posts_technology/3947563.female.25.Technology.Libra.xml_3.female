Third of all, I remembered that I had a thin-crust personal veggie pizza with lite cheese for dinner on Monday! Sharron "Food Fugue" Jones. :P  Yesterday, I had a shake for breakfast, I had a baked potato for lunch and some chicken strips (alright, I KNOW that wasn't good for me), and had a tortilla/cream cheese pinwheel and peas for dinner, with a sorbet and banana smoothey for dessert. I didn't eat much, but if I wasn't taking that multivitamin, I know it wouldn't be good for me.  Speaking of, I think the multivitamin is doing good things; my skin hasbeen a little better and I'm generally feeling good. I may be imagining things, but I think my nails are growing faster, too?  I went out to Centennial Park for a long walk last night, and found out they have a really cool greenhouse out there. Kudos to Mississauga for having such a great community facility.  I had my weigh in yesterday, and according to Heather's scale, I've actually GAINED 5 lbs. I was feeling pretty bitter about that until Bindu walked up and showed me how she can make her weight on the scale fluctuate by 10-15 lbs based on where her feet were. I would like to tentatively say that I believe my jeanswere a little looser than usual this morning, so I'm going to put my faith in the measurements on August 20th. :)
