I don't know about everyone else, but I am hardly appetized.  I am, however, talking about it - and that's exactly the  urlLink brand recognition  they were going for.      In the ads, the animals sing about the tastiness, crunchiness, and warmth of the subs as pictures of sandwiches on a grill roll by.  Near the end they tell viewers about added features that set Quiznos apart from competitors, one of them being that "they got a pepper bar."  When I first saw the commercial, I was sickened by these nasty, ugly, repulsive creatures.  It's hard to tell what they are; some mix of rat, hamster, and bad human teeth, bug eyes, and hats.  The voices are equally horrific, but Wayne does a hilarious impression of them.          The creatures are called Spongmonkeys, and they were created in Britain by a  urlLink journalist  who originally created them to sing about the  urlLink moon , marmots, and cheese, among others.  I have to say, despite originally being turned off, the others on his web site are very amusing.  There are several more animations, like the one with kittens singing about a gay bar that is particularly funny.  This officially replaces  urlLink Badger Badger Badger  as the meme of the month.
