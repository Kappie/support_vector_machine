Breakfast..didn't wake up early enough  Lunch...A spicy chicken sandwich, fries, iced tea  Dinner and snacked on food thereafter...Caesar's salad with fat free dressing (at least fat free!), chips and salsa, chicken wings, half a hamburger, 2 cups of rice, a bite of deer sausage...much much later, some more chips and dip, and some tres leches cake...ay leche!  Alcohol intake...2 shots of  Tres Generaciones  tequila, a glass of blended margarita, a glass of fuzzy navel.  Physical Activity...because I knew that I would possibly be eating in a not-so-healthy fashion, I made sure I got in about  30 minutes  of treadmill activity. Burned  300 calories . Also played volleyball while tipsy, and danced up a storm.
