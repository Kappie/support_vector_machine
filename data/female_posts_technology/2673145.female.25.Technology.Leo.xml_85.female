The company is downsizing and they had asked 3 engineers to leave. 2 in US, 1 in S'pore and she's my mentor. The CEO is coming down nextMonday. As they said, CEOdon'tvisit for no reason.He came to S'pore office once before, and that was like 5 yrs ago when they opened this office. So, we already know what this means. Lucky for me, I'm on contract and it has come to an end.   I'm job hunting. It has been about 2-3 weeks, coming to a mth and I'm tired of hunting. And I've lost my grip. I don't know what I want, and I don't think I am capable of. And I need money!!!   My bil has moved out. He is given a mth to think about/of his options and decisions. This will also give the couple a breather, and my sis a preview of what and how it'll be like should things don't work out. The Lim sisters aren't optimistic. My parents are still hopeful. They had gone to marriage counselling where my sis works so we get some feedback from the professionals. She asked us not to be too hopeful. So it probably won't look too good. If you ask me if this episode had affected me, it certainly had changed my perception. But that's a whole new blog entry. haha  No matter what life obstacles are being presented, we have to brace ourselves up and learn to face it. You can only dwell for so long but not too long cos there are other people on the line, waiting for you, affected by you. The world doesn't stop spinning. This will be how your story be like, so live it.   (that's what i think, but i don't know if it was me, i would beable to do so. but at least, its some encouragement for myself, should i be caught in difficult situation.)   I've been blessed all my life. Now that I've move onto working adult life, there'll bemore to come, and I must be brave enough to face it. In work, in relationships, love life, family, marriage, whatever. Life isn't always abed of roses. Thing won't always come so easy. That, I have to remind myself. =)   I'm leaving this Sat for San Francisco.. woohoo! Speaking of blessed life, haha, my dear sis subsidised my air fares to let me join her in her biz trip. We both have been there, but it'll be a good break for us. :) So excited.. cos I didn't really enjoy it the first time I was there. I'll be back on 10 Aug.
