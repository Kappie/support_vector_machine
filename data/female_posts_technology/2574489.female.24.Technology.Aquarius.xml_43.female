So tempted to call in sick today but am determined not to start of the new year with calling in sick at work.  Six people are out today due to sickness though.  Maybe I'll take my sick day tomorrow :b  Hubby's b-day today!  I went to Target last night after work to use a gift card in purchasing Vicks cough and cold syrup, a TV antennae (yes, we still have rabbit ears, no cable at our place), and a card and DVD for my husband.  I was coughing and had a runny nose and could feel everyone looking at me thinking,   what are you doing out here infecting everyone?  To them i say: "Aaaaccchoooo!"   There.  Hey, I have to get my hubby a card, k?  This is heroic stuff.  I drive home, I was so out of it with my nose all stuffed up and me wondering could I manage to drive with one hand, while twisting the bottle cap off my medicine and drinking that stuff like there was no tomorrow with the other hand?  I managed to wait until I got home.  I looked at my keyring and could not find my house key.    Flashback to 2 days before:  Rhy: here's your key back Me: thanks, just put it on the kitchen counter  Me two days later in front of my apartment door:  Dope!  I get in my car again, drive to woody's work, managing to come into oncoming traffic lane and escaping with my car intact (no car in sight) whew!.  I go to wood's break room door and knocked.  Some 'puti' loser gives me the look and opens the door a crack as if I could push past his 'taba' frame.  "Can I help you?"  Yeah, you can help me by getting some breath mints and getting out my way!  Instead I take a deep breath and explain to him my predicament.  I needed my husband's house key as I had locked mine in the house.  He continues studying me as if I'm some Filipino muslim girl that Osama bin laden's recruited to pose as a seemingly innocent house wife with a cold and runny nose ready packed with explosives.   I was ready to go for his shin -- or balls-- when he let me past him.  I go through the doors to the office area and say hi to Sylvia, and Kim,   "do you know this girl?" he asks them  Idiot!  Why would they be hugging me in all my coughing glory if they didn't know me?  Found hubby, gave him a kiss, got his keys, and took his money.  I hadn't eaten yet and it was 8:30 p by this time.  I said adios, drove to Wendy's, got me some 99 cent menu items and drove home.  Ah, sweet home.  Let me eat, drink my sleep-inducing medicine and go to bed.    End Credits  Epilogue:  Husband loved the DVD and the mushy stuff I wrote on the card.  I love husband.
