It had issues a few months ago and I had to have the transmission modulator, hoses and the radiator replaced.  It is doing all the same stuff as it did then.  Needless to say, I am not thrilled with the repair shop but because they did the original work, thats where my truck is.    Then as I am waiting for mom to show up, I stood up from the brick ledge I was sitting on and hit my head on their sign.    Yeah, not going to work today.  Gonna deal with the truck and keep praying that everything that is wrong they don't charge me for.   On the flip side, I have an awesome boss and he was WAY cool about me not coming in.
