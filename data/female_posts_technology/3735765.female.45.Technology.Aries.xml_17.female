I will be sharing these posts with you on the upcoming posts.  I hope that you will enjoy and share the excitement that I felt as I embarked upon this new journey! :)) BR>    SATURDAY, MAY 10, 2003 ARIES HOROSCOPE:  A committment you made is uncomfortably calling you.  Perhaps volunteering will make you a better person, but the troubles occurring today have more to do with needing to be in two places at once.     Funny!  Some things are more insightful than others.  I'm very excited about today's orientation, however, I am torn between getting someassignments completed or cutting my orientation short!?!!  I am often amazed how on cue these horoscopes can be.  On the way to the meeting, the radio sings, "Feel the Spirit!"  The orientation meeting was informative and insightful through handouts, videos  slides.  I enjoyed getting to know most of our group (I believe that one or two people couldn't make it).  We have been given assignments for devotionals on certain days; I've been given Tuesday.  My devotional is based upon Matt 2:12-13.  In reviewing the devotionals (mine  others'), it appears to me that this trip is going to be as impactful as my Emmaus weekend was in Sept 1999!  We'll see; in the meantime, the excitement rises and I'm looking forward to giving as much as I am receiving.  Before leaving the orientation, the Northwoods Presbyterian Church invited me to [be] commissioned along with them at their Church on June 1st @ 9:30am.  We also agreed on a date fo July 10th for our post trip review!
