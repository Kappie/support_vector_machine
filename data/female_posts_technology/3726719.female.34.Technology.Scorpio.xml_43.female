Then Casandra came and picked us, and the 3 of us went to play pool. Boy was my game NOT on!! Roomie would have been embarrassed. I need a lot more practice. And then somehow, I got conned into going bowling. I haven't bowled in like 16 years. It only took one time of being told I bowl like Herman Munster to end my bowling career! :o) Yet another activity that will take a lot of practice on my part. I didn't break the 70s!  It was a fun night. I like going out with the girls. Marsha had her mom/wife night out for the month. She had more than her fair share of adult beverages, so I drove her home. And I woke up the roomie to follow me in my car - yep, I owe him for that one.  Saturday started a little later in the day....well I mean we didn't get home until almost 2. I don't know what pushed me over the edge to do it, must have woken up in a strange mood, because I called Comcast and set up high speed internet. I ate breakfast, okay brunch, then showered, dressed, and headed to Metro Center. Luckily the line wasn't too bad, and the rain shower didn't last long, so I was home by 12:30 and get started with my installation. (At this point I've decided to not talk about the Honda Accord's I saw as I drove by the Honda dealership...whimper...whimper...whine..lust...lust...crave....darn budget).  I took my time installing the NIC card and setting up the modem. Everything was going fine, or so it seemed. When it came time to install the service software, it could not recognize the NIC card. I kept working on it, and in the meantime called Net Zero to cancel my dial-up service. OHMIGOD was that not the most horrendous experience I have had in years!!! First off, my call got disconnect 3 times, each after I had been holding for about 5 minutes. I finally got a human being. Actually, I think he was either a demon, or a robot. His name was Ray. If I had any kind of psychic ability, Ray would have spontaniously combusted about 2 minutes into the phone call. All I wanted was to cancel my service. I don't care that they hate to hear that. I don't want anything else. Just cancel my service. I was so angry during this phone call! Ray kept talking around me in circles. He would not listen to me! Word of warning to all: AVOID NET ZERO OR JUNO INTERNET SERVICE. Cheap service is not worth the experience I went through.  I finally got the cancellation code. Hung up and layed my head down on the desk and cried. That Net Zero phone call was a miserable experience and I hated how I had to act just to get a stupid cancellation done. So after I regained my composure (thanks to the roomie for the pat on the back and the chicken wings), I got back to the cable modem set up. I called Melissa and she didn't have any issues with her installation (here's me experiencing XP envy), so I broke down and called Comcast. Jason was a dude! It was really cool. Laughed at my reference to my blonde moment and worked patiently with me to work out my issues.  Unfortunately, there wasn't anything Jason could do. As it turns out, my computer had Windows 98 version 1. I would have to upgrade to even get the USB modem hook-up to work. Sigh.......... At this point it's after 4pm. I went to pick up Mr. D's birthday cake (ice cream cake from Baskin Robbins) and stopped by Radio Shack to pick up one of those instant access cd's so I could have internet access to get the windows upgrade and stuff that I needed.  I ended up going back to Marsha's house to get help installing an upgrade to Windows 98SE and checking my NIC card. Thank goodness for friends with skills!! :D I got back home, hooked everything up, and the thing worked like a charm! Cable internet rocks!!! And Marsha's mother-in-law thinks I'm completely insane (Well, it sounded like Marsha who answered the phone when I started chanting "i love you"). Oh, and that internet access CD I picked....well it was for Earthlink. And Courtney was an absolute angel when I called to cancel that service. So there is always a balance.  So around 8:00 Saturday night I finally finished the internet set up....took so long I missed out on a free movie outting to see Bourne Supremacy with the roomie. I ended up spending a quiet rest of the evening at home. Loving high speed though.  Sunday (happy birthday to Mr. D) started late in the day too. Abbie started meowing around 7 - opened up the cat door and crawled myself back up to bed. Roomie went to the store for coffee, I added an order for breakfast fixins, and then I cooked breakfast - scrambled eggs with ham and cheese, and some sausage. Ate breakfast, lounged around a little, got online and played black jack and euchre with Casandra. I actually played so blonde that it reduced her euchre rating. That's bad!! :o) I then went back downstairs to watch Starsky and Hutch. I actually got some stitches in on Celestial Dragon.  That's about it. I painted my toenails and fingernails, did some laundry, watched Bravo Celebrity Poker, and went to bed. Had troubles sleeping. Think it was from having caffine late in the day. Caused a headache and insomnia. Luckily I slept well and am pretty awake today.
