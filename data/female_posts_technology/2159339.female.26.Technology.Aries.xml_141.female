Luckily, I never delete emails, so I send her back an email of her own instructions. I underline, bold, and highlight them for good measure, letting her know I've done exactly as I was told. Realizing her stupidity and my stupendousness, she apologizes and ends her email with a happy face. Like that's going to get my crotch wet again. The day's ruined.  I can feel things spiraling downward and I'm enjoying the process. Yesterday in my cube I sang along with MF's "Let's Pretend We're Bunny Rabbits" and played with Kinder Egg gnome toys that a coworker brought back to see if anyone would even notice. They didn't. I don't have a job. I have 8 hours to ponder the meaning of life, which is way too long. Marcus is coming back in a week, maybe I'll bug him for a job.  Today will be spent deciding what to take at city college over the summer - Garden Practices, Tap Dance, Art History or Intermediate Conversational French.    The second party at the Wood was even better than the first, if that's even possible. We toasted Batty's birth, ate cupcakes and poured about 25 bottles of wine into the giant sangria jar. Green Marble unapologetically watered the tree outside with her barft chunks, which is why I love her. TJ MAXX desecrated our Meg White shrine on the fridge by drawing an erect penis on her trousers. XX came dressed as Elvis, complete with a red jumpsuit and shades, which got some interesting looks when a few of us smoked outside.   I am broke. This month I can't even make rent. This means no eating out for the rest of the week. With self-imposed halt on fun, I might even get some errands done.  Finally, on Saturday we found out that G got into Columbia for grad school. Since that day, parents have miraculously stopped bugging me about my future. Does that mean that pressure's off? I'm holding my breath.  Batty, say hello to Jessica Simpson for me. I'm jealous.
