What I mean by too much is basically .. anything, because it was only supposed to be a liquid diet - only protein shakes at the most. And of course, still have a couple of 'junk' items .. small quantities but they're still there. So what the hell .. I keep on making excuses. Junk is junk no matter how little I have. And food is still a bad thing to have on this diet. Will do better tomorrow.  No workouts either. Totally lethargic. The only exercise I did today was a couple of jumps up the stairs - two legged, sideways ... and some 'showgirl' kicks - 100 reps x 2 ... and some arm exercises (25 reps each of 5 different types). Not enough for whatever I consumed today.  I have a HUGE craving for a BK Whopper Jr. I think I'll have that tomorrow and not eat anything else (besides shakes or fruits) .. so it would be fine right?
