She then told the British Press that "Clinton's book made her feel "like an insignificant piece of dirt." Well when you are having an affair with a married man, you often feel like a piece of dirt.    Maybe the new publicity will give her a forum, but a forum for what, whining?  Read for yourself and see what you think.  http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5295636/?GT1=3584  I try not to be judgmental.  I know that people make mistakes, and that although an affair is a bad thing to do, it does not make you a horrible person.  Bill Clinton did not "ruin" Monica's life.  Monica was not forced into the affair.  Any account of this affair will not show Ms. Lewinsky's good qualities.  In her defense, an affair with a man that powerful might be difficult to resist.    I hope that this ugly wrinkle in our history one day goes away, but in the meantime, take responsibility.  Say I did a bad thing and then "Suck it up"  Oh, I guess she already did!!!
