I'm havin a bad day. Someone broke into my car last night and managed to steal... really nothing- but I just feel violated...and kinda suckered.The worst part about it I was parked in front of my house. I didn't even hear an alarm.   I can't even be angry at them/him/someone. Because there is nothing to be mad at. They only stole stuff - stuff which is emminently replaceable.   Besides I have too much stuff anyway. I guess.   naw. I want my toys back.
