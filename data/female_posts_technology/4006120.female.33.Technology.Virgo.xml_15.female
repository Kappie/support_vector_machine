We thought a quick drive down to the  urlLink Fisherman's Wharf  would be a good day trip especially since we still had that free dinner certificate from our last "city-weekend-play-tourist getaway" back in May.   urlLink    It's quite amazing how the weather changes so quickly in the North Bay Area. It was 93F (34C) in Marin then 20 miles (32km) down the road, just before you hit the  urlLink Golden Gate Bridge , it was 63F (17C). You can actually see the fog coming in.   urlLink    It is usually foggy in the summer time. So if you're visiting and want to see a good view of the bridge, plan the trip in spring (April-May) or fall (Sept-Oct) .  We were glad it turned out really nice when we got to  urlLink Pier 39 . We decided to chow down at  urlLink Neptune's . Great seafood din!
