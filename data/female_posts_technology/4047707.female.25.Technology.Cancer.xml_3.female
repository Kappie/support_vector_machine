Of course not the deep stuff but just stuff that i like. i'll finish the list of questions later. i promise. Don't you wish that everyone wore a tag on them saying their pet peeves and what they're looking for when ur dating? Mine would say something like, "Sense of humor is a must, smart, modesty, and don't bother with me if ur looking for someone who's patient and doesn't have a bad temper." Whoa! I'ma get all the boys with that one huh? I was talking to a buddy of mine about that today and he said that that just takes all the fun out of going out with people. U'd never meet anyone like that. But i just don't like people to waste my time i guess. I'm not looking for anyone or anything, i just thought it was an interesting point. I was asked how many people i've loved in the past but i couldn't answer that becuz at that time i felt i did and then later on i get over it. then, does that mean i didn't really love em? i care about some boys that i've been with be4 and i think about them. but if they were to come into my life right now, i don't think i'd be with any of em. that is, if i weren't with anyone at the time. but then again, i dunno if i'm taking into consideration why we left each other or who did what to who. i don't make sense. anyway, we were talking about how he's been with girls that have done the whole "i've never loved anyone as much as i love you" speech. i told him i've gotten that too. then he asked, "do u think that if, let's say that person and i were together and then we break up, she'd be telling the next guy the same thing and so on and so on?" i dunno about that one either. that'd just be an endless cycle. til u got married of course but even at that, who knows. anyway, it's all complicated but oh well. that's how it is i guess. i don't know why people, girls especially, are in such a damn rush to meet someone. i guess i shouldn't say anything cuz i dunno what they're going thru. ;) ok well just wanted to share that convo i had with bob. i'ma go get some water. night people.
