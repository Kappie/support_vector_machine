Plus, I am not going to waste your time dissecting it like it was a groundbreaking film that would change the landscape of cinema in the years to come.    5 Reasons Why I Liked This Movie:   1)	The visuals are awesome. I am really attracted to the architecture of the Necromonger civilization. 2)	Karl Urban who plays Necromonger general Lord Vaako is a hottie! In case you don’t remember, he played Eomer in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I can’t explain how he can look cute with the weird hair but he really does have an interesting face. 3)	The story is not bad although it does borrow some of the famous themes from other works of science fiction like Dune and Star Trek. 4)	It’s loud but entertaining brainless fun. 5)	It has an interesting cast: Dame Judi Dench as an “Elemental” and Linus Roche as “The Purifier”, who both end up sharing screen time with Vin Diesel.
