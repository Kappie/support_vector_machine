Because seriously, I am embarrassing myself. My co-worker doesn't do awesomely dork-wonderful dances and have retardo hand movements like Adam Green. He doesn't sing songs about Jessica Simpson like Adam does. He doesn't talk about how he never goes out without his Barnes  Noble card either.  How can he be my officebabydaddy if he says things like "firewall" and "computer parts"? This will not do. No, not at all. I'm in love with someone else now. Someone dorkier and uglier and smarter and better. So there. Pttth!   P.S. Don't tell my boyfriend.
