Which I promptly lost or had stolen this weekend (ransacking of my apartment for determination pending).  All I know is right now I have a case and accessories but no palm pilot.  BOO.  So other than throwing a nice chunk of change out the window, what has this cost me?  bank account - account info in handy money management program.  must close current accounts and open new one.  bank account 2 - use handy money management program to balance checkbook. have NO IDEA how much is outstanding and therefore NO IDEA how much is  really  left in the bank.  sanity - barely hanging on by a thread.  miscellaneous - saved files, personal info, commplete life schedule, handy program that tells me what restaurants I should be eating at.  CONCLUSION:  handy palm pilot - $450 software - $30 extra storage card - $60 having your whole life in a little computer - priceless.   Garrrr.
