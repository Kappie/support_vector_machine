    
       Let me open this one up to the readers. As a part of my new get-organized kick, I have come across two gifts that I have gotten for Christmases past which I never used, and never intended to use. The person who gave them had good intentions, I just don't have much room or need for decoration items, since I'm not home very much.     Is it okay to re-gift these things, if done in a secretive kind of way? I'm open to suggestions, since I got so many great comments about the muffins (you half-muffin-eating wierdo's!).
