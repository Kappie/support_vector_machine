But hten, there was the major change which happend this morning...I had a chat with him..it was hearbreaking, I thought I would get some closure on stuff..but instead it opened up my wounds and fears.  I dont know if its a case that he is playing on my fears or I played on my fears which is why I have got here or what!  He was short of begging and pleading with me, what did I do to get this! My life is torn up so badly where I have my parents on one side and him on the other.  My parents have done everything for me, cant I sacrfice this atleast for them?  God bought me onto this planet to be their guide in their old age and be their treasure.    Yes, I am in pain, I am confused, can this ever be fixed, or do I stand to lose my best friend in life..the same person with whom I had planned everything from the look of our bedroom to our kids names!  This aint going to help me or anyone else...I have to take a decision..and I dont think I have the choice here, I have select my parents, coz they have given me a lot more than I can ever think about!
