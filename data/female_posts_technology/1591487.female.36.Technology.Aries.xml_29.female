Who would have though to put those two together?  Those buffet chefs must have a hard time trying to come up with something new.  But of course, everyone just makes a beeline for the prawns, don't they? Big deal, so over them.  When you can have the seafood extender! I love that stuff. I never want to know what's in it.  It's delicious.  Sadly, I had to leave dinner early to come to work.  It's difficult to concentrate after a big meal, and I shouldn't really have had that second helping bread and butter pudding and custard.  All those carbs make me sleepy.  Yet another food festival awaits tomorrow, a first birthday party! Apparently there's going to be a puppet show! I'm quite excited about it and will push any children out of the way to get a good spot.  I've had so much birthday cake in the last two weeks, I feel that there'll be a global shortage of sponges and mock cream just because of me.  All that food has clearly dulled any insightful tendency I may have had.  Although many may argue that any insights I have are generally dull.  I blame the cake.
