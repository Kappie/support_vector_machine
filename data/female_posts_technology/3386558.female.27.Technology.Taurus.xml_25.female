Now if you've never heard anything about the Booth Brothers (no relation to john wilkes booth that i am aware of) who lived on this property way back when, i can tell you one thing; they were a bit eccentric. The property consists of 10 to 12 buildings, all varying from a blacksmith's shop to an observatory. they are all quite small. and a strange thing about them is that the buildings supposedly have no right angles. they specifically built them that way. have no idea why. there is one building alone with 44 different angles in it, none of which are the norm 90. were they just bad builders? where they building some kind of a doorway for cthulhu and the other elder gods to come through? did they just do it for kicks? i can't remember if there is an answer to that question, although i did take the tour as a young child myself. i suppose i will find out today and let you know, if i survive.  besides the angle thing, these buildings are all filled with various antiques: furniture, tools, housewares, etc. they have all been set on display behind little rope bars. yeah, like that's gonna stop the kids from charging like the proverbial bull in a china shop. am i supposed to stop them? am i supposed to put myself in the line of fire to protect and save the 200 year old loom? should i risk life and limb for the chair that doubles as a toilet? did they really use those? you're entertaining in your parlour and suddenly you feel the need to tinkle. instead of excusing yourself, you simply drop trough right there in front of your guests. you close the lid, sit back down, and say, "i'll empty that later" so all can relish in the lovely scent that must be emanating from your seat.  so now i must be off. wish me luck.
