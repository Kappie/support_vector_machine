They seriously treated me like a queen. This whole project w/ Mike and Steve is going to be a good thing for all of us if this all goes well which looking at it now, I don't think will be a problem. I am contemplating moving out there in the next 6-9 months. I feel that in itself will be a good move for me also. I get to be right there working on music not having to worry about flying back and forth and I will get to start over fresh, w/ a clean slate. Not having to worry about drama or bs that I put up w/ here. I have also figured out that if a friend says they hate drama and don't deal w/ it......run the other way cuz they are the ones that cause it the most! Between the site seeing, the shows, expensive restaurants, clubs, and taking the bike out Sun night....I had soo much fun! I could really learn to live like that. I will bring Collen out there a couple of times and see what he thinks about it. If he wants to, we are out of here baby! Worked on another song on the flight home. It's amazing how you get all of this inspiration out of nowhere but when you sit there and try to force it out you come out w/ nothing! That's how it works though.
