Then I discovered that with the IP address, I can find out the actual location (City, State, Country) of my visitors. (Yes, it is kind of Big-brother-is-watching-scary).  I was pleased (and surprised) to see people from all over the world hitting my blog: Germany, UK, Italy, Spain, south Africa, Canada, Singapore, and obviously USA.  So far, so good.  But a few days ago I noticed someone from Brooklyn has been reading my blog. When I saw this is a returning reader, my heart missed a bit.  I had just finished reading this  urlLink confession of a fellow blogger , in which she tells the world her Mom reads her blog. Notice my comments... (Recap: I would die if my family read my blog).  Well, my father and uncle's family are in Brooklyn. Are they reading it???   Paranoia is taking over me.    So - here is my plea: If you are my Brooklyn reader, and my sanity means anything to you, please post a short comment letting me know you are not my dad, uncle or relative.  Please . You can post anonymously, of course.   And if you, dear Brooklyn reader, are a family member as I fear: then I deeply apologize if my musings offended you in any way, shape or form.  urlLink Who said our family was normal ?
