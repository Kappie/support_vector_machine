They want to reduce the tax breaks for people who make $200k      The effect of this is that when someone like me comes along and wants to stay home with their kid, they suddenly have to remember that "Oh, my husband is going to have to make no more than $200 a year, or at least $250 (estimated) to compensate. If he hits 200 on the mark, we are going to be in worse shape than we will if he makes $190. On top of that, say one makes 60K and one makes 140k. The parent who make 60K (she makes such a low salary because of one thing: She is FEMALE- but that is another issue.) really doesn't make anything because by the time you take out day care and taxes, it is essentially gone. What is the point? She works so she can pay someone else to take care of baby all day, while she sits at a job site for what- 7 or 8 bucks an hour? Nope- not worth it. But if Husband makes $200k, she has to keep working to make up the difference for TAXES. (I haven't totally completed the logic in this theory yet, so it may be flawed.)   They think that Kerry can "Do a better job"      This is stupid. With no experience? This guy and his counterpart don't even show up for work NOW. What makes us think that he is going to show up for work if he is President? This is a man that BOUGHT his political endorsement with money that he got from some chick who has no class and lot's of luck. Money can buy ANYTHING- including a Presidential nomination. If it isn't with checks, it is with expensive parties, star studded events, etc. so that normal people can "rub elbows" with people who won't even remember their names. Ben Affleck? He is there so that he can bang one of Kerry's little girls... By his attending, it grabs the attention of the female 20-40 age group. Ahhhhhhhhh let's watch so we can see Ben- he's so hot. But really, he is being manipulated by an incredibly wealthy, incredibly corrupt group of people. Kerry is a man who uses his daughters to SELL him.   That is enough for now.
