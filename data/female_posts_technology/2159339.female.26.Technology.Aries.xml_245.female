I hadn't visited him for months since my mom and him--fairly recently--are embroiled in a legal battle. This has made her bitter and resentful so her visits have become terse and infrequent. Since she's my only ride to this boony off-road home and since she likes to make me happy, she relented to a visit.   We came into his room and I was alarmed at how emaciated he'd become: he was bony and skeletal and I could practically encircle his leg or arm with my hand. His face, to my relief, looked the same though he doesn't wear his bottom dentures anymore, making him look like a gummy old man. He was alert and talkative, and my mom took this opportunity to tell him how much grief he was causing her, but he'd only reply with confused unrelated statements like, "Did you turn off the radio?" and stubborn butthead-y comments like, "Fine, then, DON'T visit me anymore!"* While she was talking heatedly he closed his eyes and started snoozing. She continued chastisizing him but he was obviously asleep. I looked at her like, "This is absurd" and we looked at each other and realized how ridiculous it all was and laughed because it was all we could do. I said, "Well, we better go."  *(My dad doesn't talk like a teenage girl; I do, and unfortunately I'm the translator here.)  We drove down to Redwoodcity to visit my ailing gramma and aunt and we sat down to a meal of "goi cuon" with my cousins. This is where you wet a round sheet of rice paper, fill it with pork, shrimp, cilantro, mint, chive, lettuce and rice noodles, roll it up, and dip it in hoisin sauce and eat it. The key is to not overload your rice paper thus turning it into gigantic "burrito roll" or the defeated "soft taco." Your aim is to roll one that is uniform in size and shape, perfectly cylindrical like a sizable egg roll.   I started with a poor open-ended one resembling a big lettuce bouquet and my bro's GF made little lumpy ones tapered at the ends that resembled jumbo doobies. By my fourth and final roll, I'd mastered it, but I was already full. For dessert we picked at a cheesecake from Cala Foods then we went home.
