Something has to give!  My parents tell me to learn to budget.  I tell them you have to have something to budget with.  It is a vicious cycle.  If I don't work 2-3 jobs, I don't have enough income to spread to support my family; however, then, I don't have enough waking moments to share with my family.  What is a single Mom to do with daughter heading off to college in about a year???  Life can certainly be very frustrating....  Hopefully, the economy can get on an upswing....  Maybe even our employers can soon offer to match the cost of living that we so struggle with.  Perhaps, they are hoping that the cost of living comes within the range of the wages; I just don't see that happening anytime soon...  Perhaps God will shed some light to offer more hope to everyone???  One can only hope and pray....    PSALMS 18:25-19  (New Living Translation)   To the faithful you show yourself faithful; to those with integrity you show integrity. To the pure you show yourself pure,  but the the wicked you show yourself hostile. You rescue those who are humble,  but you humiliate the proud. Lord, you have brought light to my life;  my God, you light up my darkness. In your strength I can crush an army;  with my God I can scale any wall.
