But I bought 2 of Dido's songs and feel a little better...she modes me. Into a "get it done" attitude. Off track right then....I am paranoid, I guess, I woke up with my tongue real bad this morning and it was past time for medications. I don't think that this is an allergic reaction anymore. Half a pill and over 24 hours and it got worse. But the medication is still in my blood stream. I hope I am allergic or that it is definately from the medication. I am worried that it might be brain "motor" problems. For 9 years I never said a word about the voices but this last 2 or 3 years it got real bad. Especially the last year...Oh God. My memory... within seconds I couldn't understand what people where saying in front of me. I shake when I think about it. And cry.Out burst happen daily, I wanna go to the hospital. But I see my doctor Tuesday. Stoppped shaking then. Something is wrong with me. I think that if I read anything about "side affects" I will start getting them. I gotta go and be ready for work. 2 more nights.
