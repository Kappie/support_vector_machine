He was reportedly fed 4 lbs of food every day by his elderly human.  Most people probably don't eat that much!  The pleasantly plump kitty is now on a diet and living with one of the shelter employees.    I thought my cat was getting chunky, but this one takes the cake... and the pie, and the pork chops, and anything else it can get its paws on.  Sorry, I couldn't resist.
