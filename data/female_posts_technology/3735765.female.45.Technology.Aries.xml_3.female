I will be sharing these posts with you on the upcoming posts.  I hope that you will enjoy and share the excitement that I felt as I embarked upon this new journey! :))    Wow! so much has happend in these last few weeks with my cousin in the hospital (Mom says that this next week she will be moving to the recouperation area -- yea!)  Passport arrived on Thursday a week ago, money started falling into place this past week for the trip, was beginning to get things wrapped up for work, getting things wrapped up for school, getting [my daughter] centered, etc., etc., etc.  Thursday (June 5th) was the longest day in history waiting in anticipation of the trip - opening a new door of opportunities  experiences that I haven't explored.  Amazing.  Sylvia  Bob dropped me off oat the airport at 4pm -- Sharyl arrived closer to five, but I had already checked in  she was at the back of the line still.  I went on through security w/o even and waiting for others at the gate.  Our flight was delayed since Houston rained that afternoon  there were a backlog of flights gettingoff the runway.  A bus from Casa San Jose was there to meet us at the airport [in Guatemala] when we arrived at 11:30pm  took us to Casa San Jose. We unloaded our bags  got into our assigned rooms.  We were to leave to Tikal at 5:30am so before going to bed we had to pack up for a one night stay at Tikal.  To do so, we were to get up at 4:30am!  The trust I had to leave part of my stuff behind was something in itself, but we did so.  The flight there was fairly uneventful, but as soon as we arrived the humidity was noticeably more so than Houston and we all began peeling away sweaters  what we could.  A bus from the Tikal Inn picked us up from the airport in Flores and drove down a long highway past a naval bases.  Our Tikal Tour guide was there as well and introduced himself to the group.  Our rooms wern't ready yet so we changed into our shorts, ate a brief fruit plate, filled up our water bottles and started on our trek to the ruins.  We started by visiting the visitor's center  off we went.  He introduced us to the allspice tree,  the sweetgum tree, and the ants.  Along the way he also introduced us to the ceiba(sp?) tree which is their national tree. I have no idea how far we walked, stopping here and there to talk about the nature (fauna and animals) as well as various ruins we approached.  The worst was this endless hill that seemed to go straight up.  I ended up with charlie horses in my legs and waited for them in the plazas while they explored more before the rains came tumbling down.  I rode back down in a truckl.  Even the truck had problems.  If the truck was having problems, I knew I would have.  I had already been slipping and sliding in the mud up there!  We ate at approximately 3pm and had free time until around 8:30pm.  During that time I had washed my sweaty clothes and slept.  I read my book outside  in the dining room until the others arrived.  Lights out  electricity was out completel at approximately 9:30pm through 11:00am the next day.  (Electricity was also out from 4-6pm [in efforts to conserve that precious commodity in the jungle])
