I like to see things like this and the Google Toolbar, and a few other toolbar addin's I think, generally, they will make the Web Browser an easier to use application and if integrated with up-and-coming UI tools (I believe asp.net has some windows forms support for the web built into it) the web browser would make an awesome generic application host.
