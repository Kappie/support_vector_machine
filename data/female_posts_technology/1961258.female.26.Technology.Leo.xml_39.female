No meals though, so that was good .. and plenty of water.   I don't feel too well. Am feeling a little dizzy so will turn in early today. Maybe because I didn't eat much?  And of course, did not feel up to it to get on the treadmill. I have this huge fear of twisting my knee out of it's socket (which happens often) while on the treadmill and fall off. I know the treadmill has this safety key but if it's real fast, which I do go at my highest intensity .. then .. there wouldn't be time to react and my leg would buckle because it would be useless from knee down. But ah .. no need to explain that :) I'll wake up early tomorrow and do a workout of some kind - toning vid, perhaps.   And will working on the liquid diet tomorrow. Wish me luck!
