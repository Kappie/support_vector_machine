I used to read independent comics like the K Chronicles and Ernie Pook's Comeek; I supported artists like Ariel Bordeaux and Fawn Gehweiler; I loved Maus and Barefoot Gen which my friend  urlLink Raina  introduced me to, and I lamented the closing of Comic Relief on Haight St. I especially mourned the disappearance of my favorite comic hero,  urlLink Hothead Paisan , homicidal lesbian terrorist. Man, that comic was so funny. I remember I'd go to Haight St after school and if they had a new issue I'd immediately snatch it up, hungrily reading it and laughing out loud on the bus ride home.  Today XX let me pick out a few magazines at Border's and I chose Bitch and Magnet. And inside Bitch is a 7-page interview with Hothead's creator, Diane DiMassa! Oh happy day! What's she been up to? I'm dying to know! I can't wait to read it. I am drooling in anticipation.
