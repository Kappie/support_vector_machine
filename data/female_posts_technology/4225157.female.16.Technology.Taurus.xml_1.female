Aubrey and I set up the large 5 man tent tonight to see if we had everything to put it up for camp. He and Ryan are going to use it. Kelsey and I are going to use their tent. We decided to sleep in it tonight so we don't get bothered with the mosquitoes! They get in the house and bug you all night long! Anyway I hope we sleep good out there. Yesterday we had a thunder and lightening storm, it started to fires on the black hills. They are out now.                   We want to get out of here by 6:00 am Tuesday morning.  I hope we do ;) I want to get there early :D I probably won't get to type in here till I get back unless I get to use Kelsey's Lap-top ;) We also worked on the dog's kennel and the rabbit hutch. Fixed the doors on both. I let Kendra out for a while, boy is she getting big! :D She will be really big when I get back!           Well I'll try to type again before I leave, but we shall see.....ya never know what will happen! Good night all! Type at you later!          Kelsey j
