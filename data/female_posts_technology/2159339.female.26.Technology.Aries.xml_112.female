Abby and I have been busy bees, moving into our new place and battling the hordes and teeming masses of ants that have collectively decided to be our roommates. We declared war and won, because bees beat ants, 2 - 1 trillion, but it was not an easy victory. Our weapons of defense were a vacuum, a dustbuster, plastic ant traps and metal ant traps. And inadvertently, our massive gigantic ant-crushing feet. None of these were effective in the battles. What made us win the war was toxic ant chalk.   This little known secret among Americans has a cultish following among immigrant families and those that are down with Chinatown. Abby got some from her mom and what ensued was the most brutal, inhumane, and sadistic anthropod torture that two small girls could ever wage: we drew squares and boxed them in. It was a prison of poison, a poisonous prison. It was sheer hell for the unsuspecting ant, but sheer delight for us, their wronged captors.   "That's what you get for creating a mass suicide in my cider, you base, lowly, uncultivated, breeding bugs! Take that! (Draws a square.) And that! (Draws another square.) And this one, this one's for getting in my newly opened package of dried mangoes, motherfuckers!" It was sweet victory.   The next day, fallen ant bodies were everywhere. The battlefield was littered with the carcasses of our vanquished enemy.  But it was not an ignoble death, for in the end the big dustbuster in the sky descended upon most of them -the ones not along the walls or in corners- and carried their bodies up to meet their maker.
