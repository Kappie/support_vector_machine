Well, you can run, but you can never hide From the shadow that’s creepin’ up beside you.  And, there’s a magic runnin’ through your soul, But you can’t have it all. (whatever you do) Well, I’ll be two steps behind you (wherever you go) And I’ll be there to remind you That it only takes a minute of your precious time To turn around and I’ll be two steps behind.  Yeah, yeah. Take the time to think about it. Just walk the line, you know you just can’t fight it And take a look around, you’ll see what you can’t find, Like the fire that’s burnin’ up inside me.  Yeah, yeah. Oh. Yeah, baby. Two steps behind Oh, sugar, Two steps behind!
