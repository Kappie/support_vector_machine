No matter how early I go to bed I am still extremely tired in the morning. The last two nights I have gone to bed at 10 and gotten up at 6. That is 8 hours sleep, which is not enough for me. I need at least 10 hours to be fully regenerated. But I just can't justify going to bed as soon as I get home from work. I need to spend sometime with the kids as some point. I just wish I work nights all the time, then my sleep does not lack.  After I got home from work last night we took the kids for a walk on the green and then stopped at the wilmont park outdoor wading pool for a minute.  It is mom's birthday tomorrow. I am still now sure what I am going to get her. She has everything. I might get the kids to make her something. Maybe I will take them to get a craft or something at the craft store. I won't see her until Saturday.
