He sat close to the fire to keep warm from the chilly night. At the moment they were camped on top of a cliff to allow visibility in all directions.   "You never asked. Besides I thought you would have read about them or at least heard about them from somewhere." The dragon said haughtily as he picked his teeth having already eaten.  "Well I would have if there was anything written about them. Why isn't there anything written about them?" The wizard scraped the food onto a plate.  "Probably due to no one allowed in or out of that particular country and possibly because no one is alive to remember the last time. Well, no one but me though I don't think I count since I can live for at least a millennia." Trellian said with an air of arrogance while waving a talon in the air.  The wizard snorted at that remark. "There was also some caged wagons standing in the shadows with some shields and axes lying on the ground."   Trellian turned his head quickly to Bardric. "Are you sure?"  "Yes as sure as I can be without getting close enough to touch. Why?" Bardric creased his forehead.  "I'll tell you later." Trellian said swiftly. "Why don't you eat and get some sleep, Bardric? We have a big day tomorrow."  He ate with an air of thoughtfulness. He wondered what happened before to cause that particular sort of banishment and what was the dragon trying to hide from him. He looked at the dragon. He might be able to get a straight answer sooner or later from him. He sighed. He still didn't like the sound or look of this race. He can handle the trolls, ogres, even the orcs but the Drakken? He would soon see he guessed.
