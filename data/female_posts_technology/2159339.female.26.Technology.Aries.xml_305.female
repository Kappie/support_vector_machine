Spotted a whole bunch of people I knew: R-guy and his crew, Jake, and my friend Eric from work. It was a good show. Film School were good, Jim Yoshi were boring, and The Wrens rocked. I must declare one more time that The Wrens are the best live band ever. The best show is The Flaming Lips, but the best rocknroll with no gimmicks is The Wrens. They're better than The Pixies live. The Wrens's albums pale in comparison to Pixies albums, but live, The Wrens take the cake. Take that, Fat Frank!  After the show I checked my cell phone and there was one text message from my cousin and one voicemail from my brother. I knew what it meant. You know there's something wrong when you get calls from relatives late at night. After the show was when my weekend began.
