I use a template that includes formatting I frequently use in my posts, and it appeared a little skewed.   Then I noticed a few subtle changes in the interface and realized I was looking at a WYSIWYG editor (apparently the default editor - as soon as I publish this, I'm going to my settings to set my default to HTML - I'm  guessing  hoping I can).    urlLink Here's  the announcement.  Update: No way to set your preference, but  urlLink they're working on it
