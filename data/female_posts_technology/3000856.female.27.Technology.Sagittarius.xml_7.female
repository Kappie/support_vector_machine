Anyway, I guess I am doing a show on the 14th and am scared I will forget the words.  Am I ready for this? Ready or not this is it! I am not telling anyone about this show.  For 2 reasons actually 1. We are doing the show as Cased not Jetless 2. I want to get the feel of everything w/ the band and 3. I am nervous as hell! Ok make that 3 AAAGGGHHH My cornea is still swollen, went to the Dr's yesterday and they gave me another drop w/ some steroid in it.  I would like full vision back thank you very much. Ok need to get back to work. Wish me luck this weekend.
