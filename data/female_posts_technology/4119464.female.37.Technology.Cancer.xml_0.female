Here's the truth about my Sunday Morning After's...for the most part...excluding one regrettable evening in the not far enough past, I'm pretty well behaved when out on the town. With the exception of acting the fool on the dance floor. I love music and love to dance. I'm quite aware of the fact that I look like I'm on "Crack Cocaine" but here's another truth...I simply don't care what people think when they see me dance. It's all about fun and it doesn't hurt anyone so there  (sticking tongue out and thumbing my nose ).      So, about last night, we had the best time! Drinks and some kind of vegetable and chicken stiff fry affair at Jo's, Chris de Burgh's latest CD playing in the background while we indulged in "Girl Talk". Jojo's hubby headed out to a clam bake or some such thing so it was just us girls. The band at the Event was this group of young boys called, "The Mitchell Spencer Band" and they were hot. When we arrived it was still fairly early so we got to just sit back and listen for a bit and I have to say I was impressed. I doubt that anyone in the band was over 25 yet they played a terrific selection of Rock tunes from my 20's and even earlier. U2, BTO, AC/DC, Pink Floyd (awesome job of Another Brick in the Wall) as well they played some more current selections that I have to admit I'm less inclined to recall the names of, and then the real icing on the cake was a mix of their own original music. To check them out and hear one of their original tunes for yourself go to  urlLink http://www.mitchellspencer.com/  you won't be disappointed.      Unfortunately for me, going to bed at 3:30 am is not a great idea. Especially when Ahna wakes up at 7:00 am. Truth...and this never fails, if you have a small child...the chance of the child sleeping in is directly proportional to the hour you go to sleep. The later you lay your head on the pillow the earlier your child is likely to rise. Guaranteed! So from 7:00 am till about 7:08 am I tried to talk her into coming in bed with me...usually she loves mommy's bed. She'll often say, "Ahna come in with the waves mommy?" (I have a waterbed) But not this morning...this morning not only did she not want to "come in with the waves", she didn't want to do anything that involved staying on the second floor of the house...so I dragged my "tired but" out of bed and we made for the living room. I thought, hmmm...I can be a bad mommy for an hour or two and just veg on the couch and watch Dora, Dragon Tales, Clifford, Barney. WRONG!!!!!! This morning my child wants to play school and apparently it's music class this morning cause the Drum (oy!), the Xylophone, Flute, Saxaphone and Piano were quickly pulled to the center of the floor and the concert was on...my little Mozarta was at her best and quite anxious to include mommy in class I was chosen to play the Saxaphone and quickly reprimanded when I tried to play it laying on the couch..."Get Up Mommy!, Get up and play the "sphone" Eventually I convinced her that we should have breakfast cuddle up and watch Drangon Tales but by then I was fully awake...lol.     The rest of my day I spent doing the chores that got neglected yesterday in favor of hanging out with the kids. Oops, what am I saying...Truth is.... I lazed around with the girls and did very little but I kept thinking I might do some stuff and actually hung a shelf and a few "nick nacks" around the place.       Thanks for reading. Hope you had a great weekend and try not to work too hard this week, eh!
