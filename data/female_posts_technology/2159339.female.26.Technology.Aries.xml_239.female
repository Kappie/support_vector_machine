It hasn't happened yet, but it will tomorrow when it is deposited by the nice folks who ripped out my molars. Upon finding out that my current checking account balance is $0.00, I hurriedly transferred some money from my credit card into my checking account (since I bank online now), but I don't know if it will get there in time. The reason I'm so low on cash is because I've been paying ridiculous amounts of cashmoney toward my credit card debt these few months in an overzealous attemp to become debt-free and, thus, spend (cautiously) on myself again.   To punish self for this blatant lack of responsibility, I went back to the freezer at Walgreen's a few minutes ago and picked up a cheap lunch - Stouffer's Fish Fillet and Cheesy Shell Pasta, which I'm eating right now. It's no Japanese mountain vegetable soba noodles which I normally get on Mondays (for a whopping $8!), but I've made up a game in my head that has made it fun to eat. In this game I pretend that I'm in prison and this is served in the prison cafeteria for lunch. For prison food, this stuff ain't bad. I think I just tasted a hint of lemon on the fish fillet!  Ok I'm done. I wrapped the tray in the walgreens bag because if I keep smelling it, I'm going to yarf.  (soon to be) Debt No More in 2004, Abby
