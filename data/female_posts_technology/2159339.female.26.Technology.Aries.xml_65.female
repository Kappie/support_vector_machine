After a day of carrying boxes and beds and arguing with M, I was exhaused and sore and wanted it over with. In the fancy hotel ballroom, I introduced him to my coworker friends (as my 'non-boyfriend') and forbade him to dance or talk about porn. He behaved. We had a caricature drawing done, ate steak and salad and downed a few beers. In my drunken state, I apologized to Nik for running into his office a few months back when I thought we were being bombed when, in fact, it was just Blue Angels doing their annual tricks above my building. All the 30-and-unders sat at the kids table and talked about fake tans and our feeble bonuses. M  I snuck out to the pier for cigarettes. I said some more inappropriate things to my coworkers and then it was time to go back. The power was out in my neighborhood and we used a lighter to navigate our way through Batty's room, up the metal spiral staircase, down the hall, through the door and to my bed, the only furniture piece I managed to move this weekend.   We argued some more in the morning and I realized that our arrangement has passed its prime. This is exactly what I did  not  sign up for  -  fighting over the blanket, fighting over the radio station, fighting because you have completely different values and don't have much in common and weren't we just having fun anyway? He called later to apologize for saying that I'm the insensitive man in this relationship and since he's leaving in a few days, I left it at that.
