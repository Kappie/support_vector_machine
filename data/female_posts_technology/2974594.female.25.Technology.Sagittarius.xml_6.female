Managed to go out with my uni buddies to OU on Saturday afternoon for late lunch at this superb laksa restaurant!! I love the Laksa Johor!!! Had a wonderful conversation with my girlfriends about my problem with DC... I didn't expect the warm logical advises really but I guess being close friends and caring ones too, they saw that I needed some help on trying to figure things out. Perhaps my misery was pretty obvious that afternoon since I was feeling kinda down when I saw the surroundings at the mall before I met them. I poured my thoughts and along our conversation, I somehow regained my confidence to tell DC that it is over between us... That this has got to stop.  Later, I accompanied my mum to catch the movie 'Days after tomorrow' wic wasn't all that good la... I think Armageddon had better script and drama compared to this one... Quite lame actually. But since I had so little sleep the night before and after falling asleep a few times during the movie, I had to disappoint my mum by not being too enthusiastic about having dinner with her. I guess it wasn't right of me to make face and wanting so much to go home and hit the bed since (Monday was just a few hours away!) What came to my conscious mind was that I wanted some things to go my way... And if my mum wasn't happy with that, she has to just accept the fact that  I  wanted to go home since I was very much tired and it is  what I wanted ... afterall, I have been tolerating the things SHE wanted...Like me accompanying her to the movie and last week's Shrek 2.  So yeah.. tha's when I thought.. Actually been thinking a lot about it since last week la... I've been getting feedbacks from friends, colleagues, and my readings that I've got to set some things in my life and identify the  THINGS I WANT IN MY LIFE... The things I want to achieve in my career...The criteria I want in my life partner...The things I want in a relationship with friends, with my life partner, with my family... The things I want for myself, physically and spiritually.  And then my friend suggested I try this horoscope website and this is the most outstanding remark for my Personal Horoscope:  Give yourself an edge by clearly defining what you want and going for it.  You have to live your dream, you cant just dream your dream.   - How coincidental is this??!!! -  It's not very easy to clearly define the things that I want. Just last week I did the list of the things I wanted to change and so far... I still haven't changed any one of it....Bummer!  I guess it's not an overnight change, dats why I gave myself till end of this year.  but seriously, at this point of my life, I'd like to focus on things I want for me and my life more than what others want.  I've been pleasing my parents and giving them what they wanted out of me since I was born! Leeysha the obedient child, studied hard to get good grades, make my parents proud by being top student, get my degree in uni, get a good job. Never once did they cared to ask me what I wanted. I guess even if they did, I don't think I can tell straight-out what I wanted because I'll just pretend that I don't know what I want and suggest things that they would want me to be or have so that they would be happy and proud parents.  Is it coz I'm just not selfish? Keep putting others first? Why is it so hard for me to come out with the things I want for ME? I'm gonna be on leave tomorrow and I think I'm gonna have that list out by then.   Here's a great advise I got from the net this morning at  urlLink MSN Women:    Realize the worth of logic. Dare to reduce your problem to the simple elements of an equation. See it for what it is: a problem, and your objective is to resolve it.  Remove the hostage from the equation. It is simple logic. Now all you have to do, is to DO it.   Anyways, DC called Sunday night when I made my mind up... I just told him that I want this to end. I guess it took him by surprise, again for the 3rd time... And I was crying the whole night coz I said that... It wasn't what I wanted but it's something I have to do. And when I told him about it over coffee the I want it to end... Cant seem to do it straight to his face. I tried reasoning things out, put everything into perspective that whatever we're having right now is just not right and I want it to end before things get out of hand.... But hell, he reasoned things out even better! I just cant seem to get over him can I? I guess I really really want his friendship and the comfort feeling of finally meeting someone truly amazing and I do not want to lose this special relationship...That's what I really want right now.... But I'm gonna tell DC again this weekend and I'm not going to give up telling DC that "This has got to stop. I'm doing this not because I WANT to... But because I HAVE to..."  "Nobody gets too much heaven no more...it's much harder to come by.. i'm waiting in line.."
