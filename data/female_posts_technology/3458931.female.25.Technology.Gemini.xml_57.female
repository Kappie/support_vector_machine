Last night I went to see 'King Arthur' and didn't get home until around midnight, and six AM came way too soon this morning. I don't do the caffeine thing either so I spent most of the day in zombie-like stupor.  I did not, however, let my fatique stop me from attending the t-shirt printing workshop at the  urlLink Beaverbrook art gallery . I made a shirt for Jasmin with purple little paw prints leading up to a purple cat with black stripes. I'm quite pleased with how it turned out. There was also a theatrical performance upstairs but I lost track of time with my project and missed it. I also caught a few minutes of TAXI at officers' square before heading home.  I think I might try to scam some babysitting the day I move into the new house and attend the 'Dali Gala' at the art gallery that evening. Food, booze, and art sound like a good way to defrag from a move; and I need more opportunities to wear my sexy black cocktail dress and heels.
