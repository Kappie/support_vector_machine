We were told that he had downs syndrome. He had many health problems that were of great concern. No one knew what the prognosis for our son was. Of course we were devastated. The fear of the unknown was the worst.   Weeks later we were told that the tests for downs syndrome were negative. What was wrong with our baby. In between doctors visits and hospitalizations, we started to realize that there was something very precious about our son. We soon realized that life revolved around his schedule, not ours. That was good for everybody because we stopped "scheduling" things like we had been used to. We learned to just take things as they came. We took more time to sit and cuddle with our son's. We had to sit and rock one so it gave us the time to also read or talk to our other son.   Our son had many health problems, he cried a lot and so did we, but he also taught us how to accept things for what they are. Over the years, we have learned to be patient, accepting people. He has taught our whole family how to always find something positive in any situation. He has taught us that even though you may not be just like everyone else, everyone still has their own special qualities. You can do anything you put your mind to if you will only try. It might not be to the same capacity as the next person, but at least you have tried.   I now look at my other two children and wonder, how would their lives have been different if Brad was not born with all of his medical problems and other disabilities. I question whether they would have grown up to be such good people. Brad has been a learning experience for all of us. He is truly the most wonderful imperfection in our family.
