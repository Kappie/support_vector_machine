I guess that truly shows I have no life.. managed to wash down breakfast with a glass of OJ while watchin adolescent at it best on TBS…headed to the kitchen to placed dishes in dishwasher … walked upstairs and took cold shower .. had to wash hair… listen to Z100 while getting dressed… I wonder what it’s like to be a radio personality… must be amazing.. those guys never run out of things to say..or never have awkward silences with their audiences .. I don’t think I could ever be a radio personality… decided to blow dry hair didn’t want it to turn into a frizzy mess…and threw on some clean clothes and headed out the door…to find out that empty garbage cans are blocking the entrance of the driveway … placed garbage cans on front lawn and rushed out of the driveway .. I broke my record time by takin 3 min to drive to work… I’m quite please with myself … walked into work say hi to co worker … log onto computer and start reading emails … today can’t be as bad as yesterday.. so I think I’ll start today off with a smile…: )  Thought for the Mind: When a friend hurts your feelings or u get a notion that they are degrading you..what should u do?… I would take out the time to just relax think things through .. go over what happened … It’s a matter of saying sorry and then replayin by saying “it’s ok .. I forgive you” ..  but it’s up to u whether u want to forgive that someone… I tend to always forgive and that is my weakness .. I need to go to sleep at night knowing that I did not hurt anyone’s feelings … if someone is hurting then u should know that they are truly sorry … u just need to be careful that they don’t hurt u again…next time I’ll keep my eyes open…
