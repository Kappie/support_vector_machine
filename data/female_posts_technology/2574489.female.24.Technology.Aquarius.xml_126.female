But as long as its coming....  ***    Take Me Away   The US does not have a Holy Week.  The Catholic and Christian churches celebrate the corresponding masses, but there is no week-long reflection where there is no work or school.  This is one of the things I miss about Philippines a lot.  Admittedly, nowadays Holy Week in the Philippines is not spent reflecting on Jesus' life but on a holiday away from the daily grind...Tali, Boracay...Oh, I'm dreaming of Boracay. I cannot believe we have white, powdery beaches in our country with clear waters. Just a plea from a future visitor to those currently visiting...Don't spoil it! I hope when I visit next year, it is still pristine, not teeming with trash or anything else except marine life.  I really need to get away. I think, next week, I'll take a day and a 1/2 off.  I have to preserve my vacation days for the trip to Cali (July) and for Vegas (November). But next year...Philippines, and Boracay for 3 weeks!
