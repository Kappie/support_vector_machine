Debbie still dances like Dame Edna, but they were great. Clem Burke must be about 19 now, looking at him. A bit too much of the disco stuff for me, and a touch too much new stuff as well, but they always do that so I can't complain. All in all a fantastic night. I was pleased they did X Offender and Rifle Range, but one day I hope to see them do "Die Young, Stay Pretty". Lee Fox (bass player) looks like the child of Dee Dee Ramone and Charlie off Coronation Street, who is now rivalling T**d G******w for sheer selfish horribleness. At least we have reached incidence number two of soap Nirvana - first Jason chins Nick Tilsey and last night Leanne chucks a pint over him!! You can't beat it. We had a power cut on Friday night. I was all ready with the candles (we had already had a mini acoustic concert by him indoors)but then it came back on. Boooring...Power cuts aren't like they were when I was a child ( and I was a child during the super ones of the 1970s!)
