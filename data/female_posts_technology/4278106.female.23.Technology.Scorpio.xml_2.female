I woke up at 01:00 in the morning to find myself seeing images that were dancing in front of my eyes. I closed them just to reasure myself that it was all a dream and I kept on thinking, "What's the deal God?"  Today I'm questioning if working @ the place I'm at is really worth it. I'm traveling 6 hours a day to get here and back, I find myself bieng a front line receptionist, that aint my proffession. Now I feel that I'm bieng undermined and treated like a complete idiot - suppose It's my imagination, however I can't give up. My loyalties always interfere with these cases of feeling unsettled.  I seem to have turned into a person who is constantly questioning things. I have boyfriend - who by the way is in human terms - a hunk, yet I can't find time to spend with him. I'm ending here today, all I want is for things to be the way they are. What's my deal dear God?
