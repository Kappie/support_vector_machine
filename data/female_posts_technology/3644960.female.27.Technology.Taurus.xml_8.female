As I've always said the only thing better than reading a good book is sharing that book with others.  This post will be updated monthly with the latest book our club is reading.    August 2004    urlLink The Descent  by Jeff Long  I was pleasantly surprised to learn that several members of the book club are actually closet sci-fi fans. I was a bit worried we'd be reading mostly autobiographies and literary classics each month. Not that I'd complain, I have several that match that description on my wishlist, but it's nice to be able to spice things up a bit with sci-fi and fantasy.    July 2004      urlLink The Jane Austen Book  Club by Karen Joy Fowler  This book didn't go over so well with the book club members. I ran out of time and was unable to read the book but decided to still attend the monthly meeting (after all, book clubs really are just another reason to socialize!)  Most of the members were left wondering why the book had received such high critical acclaim and praise. I'm definitely not sorry I missed this one.
