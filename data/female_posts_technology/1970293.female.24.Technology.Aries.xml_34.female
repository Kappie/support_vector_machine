I had to make such a decision and the consequences that followed that choice is what makes this tale very unique.  Or at least so I thought.    My name is Lizzy and I was born just like everyone else.  I had parents, relatives, a house, a dog, even a wayward cat just like everyone else.  Normal I tell you, my family was completely normal. I went to school, got average grades.  I wasn't a genius but then again I never tried.  Maybe if I tried harder, things would have been different.     I worked when I was old enough to make a little extra cash to buy the things I wanted.  Of course my parents said that since I was working I could buy my own clothes which didn't seem to fair to me.  I didn't make a fuss though.    I had two older brothers whom did what they pleased.  As soon as they were allowed to ride their bike past the block, they were never home.  I guess they pretty much stayed out of trouble.  I can't remember any rebellious antics that exploded through the family.  There were four years between each of us I guess to keep mom sane as she raised us.  I don't think I ever want to have children after being a child myself.  I know how hard it is to raise children and how much misery they seem to bring growing up.    Of course that was a childish thought.  It seems with the right man anything is possible even children.    Before I get a head of myself I need to explain the how and why of everything before the decision.   I just graduated from school.  I didn't know what to do with my life so I thought I would try another town maybe another life out before making kind of decision.  I thought about college but just the idea of being cooped up for four more years didn't excite me at all.   I got a small place in the next town and got a job waitressing.  After all I didn't want to move too far away from home just in case.    Waitressing isn't all that exciting either but sometimes meeting a certain person just made it all worthwhile.  Some people were just so interesting and so unusual that it is a unique experience to hold a conversation with them.  The tips are good but it sure did make my feet hurt at the end of the shift.
