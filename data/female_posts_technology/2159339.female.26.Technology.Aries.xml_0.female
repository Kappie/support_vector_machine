Two years ago, when I started feelin lonely around the fall season, it was replaced by the warmth, good cheer, and mulled wine of Christmastime. But this year, ladies and germs, Halloween's back on top! #1!   Everyone in the office is being ridiculous and goofy and having a good time. I received lots of compliments on my costume. Most people were like "Ew, gross: Bloody baby!" but a handful, mostly programmers, took one look and were like, "Alright... Kuato!" During the pizza party in the staff room the CEO announced all the winners of the costume contest and I won "Most Disturbing". Before I went up to collect my prize, I performed "The Birth of Kuato" for everyone. This is where George, Kuato's host, faces a wall, makes some orgasmic gasping sounds, then turns around to reveal Kuato. It went well and afterwards all these boys asked for my number...   When people have dogs or babies, it gives people a reason to socialize and interact. This theory apparently also goes for bloody baby parts glued to an old sweatshirt.  I'm feeling spastic and gleeful and outside, it's raining. First rain of the season... that strange fall rain where it's bright, crisp, cold, and showering. Outside this office, the world undulates with possibility.
