I was in for a double shock, albeit a pleasant one, when I went to the library the first time after it was opened after the renovation.  It was swarmed with people. Well, it was understandable as it was Sunday. You can see teens whispering and looking at books in the teens' corner on level 4.Young adults mugging for their studies in some corners of the Research centre on level 3. Daddies, mummies and their kids doing leisure reading on level 2.   Overall, the library was spacious and well-equipped for academic and family gatherings. The only negative feedback I wanted to give was that the pathetic number of tables that the library provide for readers. I guess it is a strategic move to keep muggers from staying too long in the library, reading their own books than the library books. It explains the increased number of cushions. Yet, I felt it would be a great loss to people who are cramming for exams be denied of the conducive environment to study. Hahah....I am onli talking on my own behalf.
