This means that only in the past year of our acquaintance, there were at least three moments, in the process of moving into three apartments, in which the thought crossed her mind, "oh now I can't throw out the raspberries!"  Never mind the fact that they look disgusting; there has been no appreciable decrease in the raspberry content of the jar (yes I do notice these kind of things).  Even at the paltry rate of consumption of one raspberry per week, that jar would be long gone by now.  
 I'm really not as bothered by this as I sound, mostly just curious.  I move all sorts of junk that I never use around with me, but food?  What goes through one's mind?  It would've lasted through one apartment change with me, but then I would've broken down and admitted that I'm never going to eat that.  Maybe The Jar was a gift, so it's kept around out of guilt.  Maybe it really houses the soul of some dark being and she's its sworn guardian.  I'm sure one day the curiosity will get to me and it'll just come out- "I'm heading to the store, do we need toilet paper, now come on, what's the deal with the raspberries?"
