I picked up some peas in the pods, broccolli, onions, new potatoes, salad, oh and smoked bacon from Mulders!     We (D and I) walked to Queen St. to check out the comic shop and the fountain was filled with bubbles. I had a blast scooping them up and throwing them into the air. D looked on; still too self conscious to do anything so silly, but I got her to play a bit. Then we realised it was getting late and the comic shop wasn't going to open until 10, so we had to leave.     We drove all the way northside for her sisters' yard sale where I bought a hammock contraption for $5. After than we rushed home because I had a coffee date with someone. Wow that was a busy morning!    In the afternoon D and I went back into town for comics, I bought a new sketchpad and pencils at endeavors, and then I stocked up on groceries at the Friendship store. The Friendship store has the BEST tofu, IMHO, and the container it comes in is reusable and a good size. I bought veggie potstickers, which are rare to find there, and a bunch of other frozen dim-sum.     Once home with the groceries unpacked I went for a bike-ride and finished the last episode of 'Last Exile', a really great anime series. D and I once again ventured out in the evening to see Anchorman; very funny. I'm topping the night off by reading comics in bed, how perfect!
