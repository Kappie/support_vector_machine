I will be sharing these posts with you on the upcoming posts.  I hope that you will enjoy and share the excitement that I felt as I embarked upon this new journey! :))      O, God, who by thy Son Jesus Christ hast set up on earth a kingdom of holiness, to measure its strength against all others:   make faith to prevail over fear , and righteousness over force, and truth over the lie, and love and concord over all things; through the same Jesus Christ our Lord.  Amen.  -- George Wallace Briggs  Hmmmm...liked this prayer today. I think many of us don't trust our entire faith to God.  Any doubts, questions, etc. of the unknowns on this trip  must  be anilated by our complete faith in Him to guide us through everything.  He probably has the only clue as to our faith journeys we are about to embark upon.  I am real excited -- so much that my sleep schedule is completely off.  I doubt that I'll really rest until I have my passport at hand and I'm on our 3-hr flight to Guatemala City.   3 weeks from yesterday, we will be on our flight there!  How exciting!! (SMILE)
