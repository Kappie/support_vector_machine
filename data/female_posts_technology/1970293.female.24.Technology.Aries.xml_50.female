He watched the spectacle from the safetly of his cave.  There was such power tonight.  It could only be magic for this sort of storm at this time of year was unheard of.  He pushed his hair back behind his pointed ears.  Many would not believe that such as he existed since his people tend to not make many appearances in the land of man.  But he was on a mission of some great import.  The elves have felt some sort of magic in the lands of the north and it was his duty to find out who and why.  Such magic is dangerous especially weather magic.  It could throw an entire ecosystem out of phase which could cause flooding, droughts, blizzards among some of the worse scenarios in other lands.  He smoothed his leather shirt and straighten his pants before going back inside to his warm fire.  His mission was one of secrecy since no one must know that he was here.  Among his people he was considered a warrior and a wizard with an unusual sense of peace that filled his life.  He hated violence and yet it seemed that he could never escape.  He hoped this mission could be completed quickly so he can return home and to peace.  All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003
