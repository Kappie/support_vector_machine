When they were done I used the pot holder to take them off the stove and drained them in the sink. I then decided to put them back into the pot, I have no idea why so I grabbed the pot handle, without the pot holder, and needless to say I got a 2nd degree burn on my index finger and middle finger. It hurt like hell. Duane wasn't' home so I called him at work to find out what I should do. He told me he would talk to the pharmaists about it and call me back. He calls me back and tells me to put my hand in cold water and it should feel better and to use ointment after with a bandage. Fine, I put my hand in water, it isn't feeling any better my whole hand is burning and feels like it is on fire. I can't go to the hospital because I have the kids at home with me. So Duane finally gets home and yells at me for being a whiner and that it can't hurt that bad. Anyways I get him to put the bandage on and he ends up grabbing my finger and squeezing it I flipped out. He was like what's your problem, blah blah. He was a total jerk about the whole ordeal. Well at 11 I ended up going to the hospital. I just couldn't stand the pain anymore. They wrapped it up for me and gave me some tylenol 3's to take home. Well it feels better today thank god.  Me and the kids are heading up to mom's camp for the weekend. It is finally suppose to be nice. Although today is quite windy. I have to take my car in to have it looked over and get inspected before we head out on our trip to Ontario in three weeks. Hopefully everything is going to be fine.   off to take a shower.
