As Christians, we should bear with people who aren't there yet, who don't know about God, and not put them down or criticize them to make ourselves feel better or greater-than-thou.  We should be encouraging other people, being nice to them and making them feel good about themselves, and then they might be more open to hearing about what we believe.  Even Jesus did this, and when people had bad things to say against God, he took those insults on himself. Everything written in the Bible is there to teach us, so that we can have hope in God, and so we can show hope to others who don't know God yet.  We don't have to agree with everyone else, but we should accept them anyway, and love them anyway, the same way Jesus accepted us.  I probably interpreted this incorrectly, and read more into it than was there.  But it just seemed to be in line with what I was thinking, about how we're supposed to be, and act, and represent ourselves as Christians, not just to other Christians but to non-Christians too.  We are supposed to set an example of love and acceptance, the way Jesus did, and we should be reading and learning from the Bible so we can teach other people too.  So even if I'm off-base with what with passage was specifically referring to, I still think that's a good lesson to keep in mind.
