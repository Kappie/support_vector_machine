There's no turning back under penalty of death (I might be exaggerating). This morning I shucked and consumed an ear of corn. Incidentally my ears started burning... then arms starting itching. I pulled up my sleeves to investigate and noticed that they were turning bright red. This is about the time that the burning sensation consumed my entire body, and I was pretty much red everywhere I checked and found a few welts on my belly. joy. hives. Funny thing is, the same thing happened yesterday when I had corn, only it wasn't as bad. It's never happened before then. I've often had raw corn even before being raw. So, I spent some time researching food allergies and found the following:  "Spaghetti sauces, baked beans, canned soups, and most things found in a normal pantry, contain some corn-derived product. Read the labels. You will be amazed that even peanut butter, processed meats, imitation seafood, and imitation cheeses can contain corn derivatives.  Those who are allergic to corn need to avoid eating products that contain whole corn, corn flour, cornstarch, corn alcohol, corn gluten, corn sweetener, corn sugar, corn syrup, corn meal, corn oil, or popcorn. With this in mind, also watch out for the terms dextrose (also known as glucose or corn sugar), dextrin, dextrates, maltodextrin, caramel, or malt syrup on ingredient labels because they may also be sources of corn. Dextrose is used in cookies, ice cream and sports drinks. It is also found in crispy foods such as french fries, fish sticks, and potato puffs. Dextrin and maltodextrin, often made from corn starch, are used in sauces, dressings, and ice cream as thickening agents. Commercial food producers often make caramel flavoring with corn syrup instead of cane or beet sugar. Corn is used in maple, nut, and root beer flavorings for ice cream, ices, candy, and baked goods. Many soft drinks and fruit drinks contain corn syrup in the flavoring. Grits, hominy, maize, and marshmallows are also sources of corn. Corn starch is added to most confectioner's sugar and baking powders to keep them from caking or clumping. Corn may or may not be in food starch, modified food starch, vegetable gum, or vegetable starch. The manufacturer should be contacted if these terms appear on an ingredients label to see if corn is a factor. Also distilled white vinegar, bleached white flour, and iodized table salt may contain corn."   I think that about covers everything, no? I don't think I'll risk experimenting. :o) I'll stay raw, thanks.
