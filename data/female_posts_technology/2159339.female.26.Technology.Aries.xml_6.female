When I lived around there last year, the cashier was this tall 40-something dark-skinned man with a bulbous bumpy nose. He was scruffy and rugged and looked like he loved to live hard. He was always moving and talking at frenetic speeds like he was on drugs. I imagined that on his breaks he'd do blow with the cooks. Lately, though, the cashier has been a tall 30's-ish man whose face reminds me of Dopey Dwarf. He has big child-like saucer eyes, pale skin, and a saintly expression: calm, pleasant, and maybe a little amused. Maybe he was a little amused because the first time I ordered with him I chirped, "Super Sesos Burrito, por favor." (Beef Brains. Not a typical order, I bet.) I enjoy his placid demeanor and he has nice teeth too. He smiles alot. I imagine that afterwork he likes to write poems.
