This will save you much anguish and petrol money driving all over the countryside attempting to find discontinued balls of yarn to finish your stupid jumper.  And just so you know, this is mainly a tip for me.  This is has been my life for the past couple of days, beginning from the initial 'shit, shit, shit' realisation that eight balls of anything was never going to cut it for a lardy ladies' jacket, to the 'I'm sorry, we don't stock THAT particular yarn', said in a very noticeable condescending tone' to my creepy gratitude expressed to the lovely manchester assistant Sharon at Big W, who knew EXACTLY what my crisis was (clearly, there's A LOT of disorganised knitters out there).  She was able to scrounge the required balls of yarn from the very back shelf.  She even had to get a step ladder! What a nice person, if I had not been on the phone, I would have hugged her.  Of course, did this stop me from purchasing yet even more yarn at a reasonable cost, with no particular project in mind? Because yes, three balls of something fluffy and nice will make a scarf, but do I really freakin' need another scarf? No, I don't.  I need to get my knitting shit together and start planning shit.  I'm not even going to begin to attempt to translate that to other areas of my life just yet.  One major thing at time, thanks.
