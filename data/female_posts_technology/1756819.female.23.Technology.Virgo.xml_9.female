My family on the other hand, has a rather strange relationship to its pets…as one of friends exclaimed, “you eat your pets?!?”  Now before you get all grossed out, I should explain that my family keeps some very unusual pets.  Sure we’ve had the ordinary cats, dogs, birds, and fish, those we don’t generally eat...that's gross.  However, we have also had pets such as pigs, wild boar, deer, pheasants, and other more exotic pets.  Take for example, Flag, our pet deer.  When we lived on the farm, my parents used to keep fallow deer.  I think we had a herd of about 30 or 40 deer.  Now for those of you who don’t know, deer are very skittish…they scare easily.  Whenever my dad would feed them, he would talk to them as he approached the gate, just so they would know he was coming.  On one occasion, despite his warning, one of the does got scared and ran into the wall of the barn, breaking her neck.  And it just so happened that this particular doe also left behind a brand new fawn.  Without a mother, the fawn would die, so my dad took the fawn to his parents’ apartment so that his mother could care for it.  The fawn was dubbed Flag - for reasons that I can no longer recall – and given a home in the laundry room.  My Oma fed Flag from a bottle and kept him warm and dry…and the tough little guy survived!  As Flag began to get bigger, he would jump out of his box and bounce around the living room.  I can remember one time when my Oma tried to fit Flag with a diaper, so that he wouldn’t make a mess on the carpet.  Needless to say, Flag was not impressed and won that particular struggle.    As Flag outgrew his box in the laundry room, my parents took him back to the farm and gave him a pen of his own.  He always loved to have visitors, and my brother and sister and I would pick grass and poke it through the holes in the chain-link fence for him to eat.  Whenever we walked past his pen, he would rub his antlers along the fence (quite a racket) to get our attention.  We would also take guests to see Flag and show them how to feed him through the fence.  We couldn’t pet Flag like you can a cat or a dog, but he was a fun and rather unusual pet to have around.  But like all things in life, all good things must come to a close.  One afternoon when my dad was feeding Flag, Flag knocked my dad down and tore through my dad’s jeans with his antlers.  As my siblings and I watched, my dad had to wrestle with Flag to prevent him from doing any further damage.  My dad came out with a very nasty bruise on his leg, but otherwise, he was ok.  My parents decided that Flag was getting far too dangerous to keep as a pet, and it was off to the butcher for Flag.  My parents put the meat in the freezer…that was some good venison.
