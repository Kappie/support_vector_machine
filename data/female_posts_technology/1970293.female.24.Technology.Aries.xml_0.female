Of course they do not go into each of the assistants lives but they do go into detail on Elisabeth Sladen who played Sarah Jane.  She played under the roles of Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker during the years 1973 to 1976.    I do remember her fondly but she wasn't one of my favorite assistants.  Each assistant had a role to perform and in my opinion a difficult one.  They had to fit in with the Doctor's personality in order to keep the show interesting.  Sladen had her own style in which she supported the role of the Doctor completely as well as added a flare to the show.  That is enough of my two cents, read the article.  It's fairly well written.
