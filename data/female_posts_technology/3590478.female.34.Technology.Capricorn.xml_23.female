There's lots of snow centered activities there including, but not limited to, shopping and drinking. After the shopping but before the drinking we decided to take a sleigh ride. Our snow bunny guide gave us a little speech before we pulled out beginning with, "Hi! I'm Buffy* and I'll be your sleigh master today!" So I turn to the rest of the group and go, "Shouldn't that be sleigh-er?" Lots of giggling ensued and Deb says she was thinking the exact same thing and everybody got it because we are all big geeks but because I said it out loud does that make me the biggest geek of all?  *Not her real name but I changed it for the story because, duh.  Hey, it turns out I didn't really blow out my speaker blasting Iggy Pop. The speaker just needed a nap or something because I was blasting the backstreet boys this weekend and it woke back up. How disturbing is that?  Apparently god loves cheese as much as we do.  urlLink http://poizenideas.com/cheesus/   Ok, so it's all just a ploy to get us to love Richard Cheese. But really, we should be doing that anyway.  Come to Twains tonight if you'd like a babbling, disturbed explanation of where this quote came from. (or, really, I don't care. Email me if you'd rather.)  DRUGGED GIRL: (to Faith) "Hey, you're pretty. You wanna make out?"
