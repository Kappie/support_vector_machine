He's posed the question as to why they should live in the US.  There are many.  First, the taxes will not be as high.  Canada and England both have socialist governments and these two countries do take the burden of college and medical bills.  However, that means collecting almost half of your paychecks.  What about doctor's bills and college in the US you ask?  Well, with your profession, you'll command the same high salary, and good benefits including medical and dental benefits.  You can elect to have your employer take a portion of your paycheck every payday and pay it toward your own dental and medical insurance which can include your whole family.  But it will not be half of your paycheck.  You'll be taking much more of your paycheck home for your own discretionary use.    For college, the government has these amazing things called government student loans and grant.  If you're poor enough, you get grants, which you never have to pay back.  If not, your children are qualified to get a low-interest loan which they start paying back 6 months after they graduate.  They are given 10, 15 and even more years to pay it back.  For example, I pay $160/month for my student loans and it'll be paid off in 10 years.  Now, my income may go up in those 10 yrs., but my payment never will.  To me, the these are great reasons to work in the US.  Also, its the US!  We have baseballe games, MTV (the original MTV, the real MTV), diversity.  If you live in Texas, especially Dallas/FW area, the housing is really cheap.  You can get credit cards, you can get 0% financing on your car with zero money down.  You have huge shopping malls, fast food and convenience stores in every corner, you have high-speed internet, and many more.  Plus, Meg and Malone will be so cute with their accents here!...trust me, Americans love the british accent.    The best reason to move into the US?  We're here!  Hehehe.  You'll get to see both Mama here family and Tito Darwin and his family.  No matter whether you live in our state or Tito Darwin's, we'll see more of each other...  Did I convince you enough?  Move here already!  But maybe wait until we get to visit you!  Love,  Me -
