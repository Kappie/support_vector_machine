Knowing I had a busy morning schedule ahead, I brought a boiled egg and toast with me to work today - thinking I'd grab some breakfast bites between calls.  I get a break, I peel the egg's shell, I run to get a knife to cut the egg in half  (I was never allowed to just bite into a whole egg, as in Judasim, eating whole eggs is something that can only be done when in mourning. At any other occasion, the egg must be cut in half).   So I cut the egg in half, and lo and behold - my egg had two perfectly round yolks. Identical twins waiting to happen. What are the chances?  After a few pangs of guilt (over the twins, and over the double dose of cholesterol and calories) - I scarf the egg down.  No picture taken. Nothing but this story as proof.
