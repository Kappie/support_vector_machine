However, my keyboard broke, my phone broke, I had to move to a different cube with no friends to sit beside and I had all kinds of tough issues to tackle that I had to call supervisors and specialists for repeatedly.. oh well, at least I learned something... riiiiiight.... and I didn't get another awful nosebleed like I did yesterday, wwhich is always a plus. I get excited over the small things. Looking forward to hanging out with friends on the weekend and renting The Butterfly Effect and Donnie Darko, both of which I haven't seen before, so don't ruin it for me! My friend Stan moved and was supposed to have his internet reconnected today, but I don't see him online, so I'm hoping maybe he will be a little vampire like me and come on late tonight. Right now waiting for my husband to come home from work and get me so we can go eat dinner.. I'm starving! All I've eaten today was a yoghurt, some candies, sandwih, coffee, diet pills and a bottle of water. And had a few cigarettes which are making my throat sore but I'm starting to like them again. Uh oh. Someone come online and chat with me! Message me on MSN or Yahoo! Talk to me on Hi5! Comment on my boring BLOG! Anything! Need human contact please, even though I get it all day, if I'm without it I start getting withdrawal pains!
