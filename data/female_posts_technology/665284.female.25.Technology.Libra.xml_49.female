Then the next problem was she did not know how to cancel the check in the system Then we encountered an error in deleting her voucher. It all came down to the fact that the account that she used for the voucher is already closed *dammit* Pressure here because she wants to finish the closing activities tonight. And ofcourse here we have to exhaust all means of troubleshooting first blah blah blah before talking to the big guns upstairs. Natarayan pa ako. Buti na lang nag reply yung naka copy furnish ng mail and took the matter off my hands. *whew* Yun lang.  Away. Away.. Away...
