It gave me the best, saw to that I gave back the best to life and now has kindof left me in a situation where I am wondering where was I all this while...in my dreams or in reality?  Currently I am trying to move out of stranded phase, where I want to leave the past and move to the future. What to do, how to do ...where do I begin? Well, a set of interesting questions, but I think the answer really lies within me. I need to take that initiative and move on with stuff. There is simply no use holding onto something which gives one pain and hurt.  Yesterday I was watching the movie paycheck, and there was an interesting statement made in that.."life is a sum of all our mistakes". Quite ironical, but then, its true. Everytime we make a mistake, we learn from it and try not to make the same mistake again. When we commit the same mistake the second time, we learn a new lesson. The process of learning never ends, its an ongoing cycle.  Life cannot stop for anyone, its' not the way of the world. Time governs us all, and this time only knows when and what will happen. You can dodge your destiny upto a point, after which it will come and bite you and when it does, you might even repent for having dodged it the first time.  As I initiate myself in the process of embracing my past, closing out the questions which haunt me and terrify me, all I pray is that the almighty stands by me again thro this process and gives me the courage to survive this.
