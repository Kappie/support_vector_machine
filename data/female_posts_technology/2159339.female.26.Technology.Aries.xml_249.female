"I'll do it!" I screamed from across the room. After several phone calls between me, my boss, and the production department, it was settled - I would break the routine of my boring office life and visit our state capital.  Cool things  about being here - my car, Lucille, is parked FOR FREE downstairs (downtown SF garages rape you out of three bucks for every fifteen minutes), I have my own office with a view of said car, I can leave at 3 to go to Best Buy and get my iPod.  Lame things  about being here - it's effing hot!, there's lots more driving in store for me, and I'm missing the Free Food Friday at my sf office. Still, anything to change things around a bit..  Since M is busy all weekend and Bart D will take away dear Batty, I'm going to Chico tonight for a comedy show and some culture, of course.
