I think primarily because it's a bit swirly and a bit 50s, it's just a tweedy A-line number, but it's swirly! And it was a bargain to boot. All I feel like doing today is skipping along and whizzing around so that my skirt twirls.  Although legitimately that would mean not much productivity and possibly alot of feaking out of coworkers. Although they freak me out regularly, so it would be worh the payback.  Excuse me , while I walk over to another desk and then turn suddenly, ooh look! my skirt twirled!
