I pulled a twelve hour day at work, which usually isn't too bad but it's awful when everything is taking longer than you thought and you just want to go home.  So today I was gone from work as soon as the clock struck five.  My roomie and I decided to go float around in the pool for an hour or so before heading over to Urban Mill for dinner.  So here I sit, enjoying an evening of nothing after a long, long day at work yesterday.  A very low-key evening.  I been playing around with the colours on this page and making the page more uniform.  What do you think?  Very bright.  But I like it.  For now at least.
