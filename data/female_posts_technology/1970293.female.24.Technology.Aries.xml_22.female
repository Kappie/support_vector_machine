Truan felt goosebumps on his neck and arms.  This spectre of darkness did not leave much to his imagination.  He didn't go by the name of Truan for a long time.  His street name has long since been Shadow when he first learned to steal for a living.  He positioned his body slowly for a quick dash down the alley in which he came.   "Who are you to keep calling me Truan?"    "A friend of a friend.  Actually he is your relative, an uncle I presume."  The stranger replied quietly once more as if the language was either too simple for his taste or a second language.    Truan guessed both since anything could be possible at this point.  An uncle?  It couldn't be Lieth, could it?  He took a closer look at the messenger.  How could he trust someone or something when it won't show itself to him?  "How do I know you are telling me the truth?"  "Actually you don't.  The only way you will know I speak the truth is to come with me right now to a place where your uncle waits.  That, of course, is up to you.  I can assure you that no harm will befall you while you are in my company."  The dark spectre made a grand gesture further down the alley.  "I will start walking while you make up your mind to follow."    Truan watched him leave.  Should he follow or should he not.  This could be a chance to see his uncle after ten years or so.   Without further thought, Truan found his feet following after.  He only hoped his feet didn't lead him into trouble but that of course would be nothing new.
