It made me realize that music plays a big role in helping us remember important people and events in our lives. It has the power to bring us back to the time when life was simpler. Having the benefit of hindsight, when I hear certain songs I can now laugh at the times I was a psycho ex-girlfriend, an alcoholic and dating the worst ever losers on this planet. I can also become wistful about the time when all I had to worry about was where next weekend's night out was going to be. I'm over that phase now in my life. Everything is pretty much in order and I have more grown up things to worry about now. I'm pretty much sober 90% of the time. Just don't let me stay more than 2 weeks in Manila.:)  Since I am in a reminiscing sort of mood today, I have compiled the Top 10 Songs that would be stored on my laptop if I had enough space. If you know me well enough, you can actually play a guessing game of which big event or who I am reminded of everytime I hear these songs. I will not apologize for my terrible taste in music. This is just me.:)  The Songs: (in no particular order)  1) Someday We'll Know (the original New Radicals version and not Mandy Moore) 2) Everything You Want (Vertical Horizon) 3) I'll Be(Edwin McCain) 4) Barely Breathing (Duncan Sheik) 5) If Your'e Gone (Matchbox 20) 6) Iris (Goo Goo Dolls) 7) My Immortal (Evanescence) 8) Your Song (Elton John) 9) This I Promise You (N'Sync)- only because this is going to be played at my wedding if by some miracle I actually marry anyone. 10) I Think God Can Explain (Splender)  I'll come up with a second list maybe a few weeks from now.
