The cool wind blows away the worries that make me anxious, and the problems that cause stress. And the rustling of the leaves or the waves crashing provide me with soft music to calm the soul. Everything feels good and right. I find that the space we are living in is far greater than what our mind allows us to see when we are consumed by the everydayness in the city. I long to feel that sense of serenity again. I remember the different times in my life when I experienced that on the different beaches and fields I lay on. I would be in the company of friends and family, but what I enjoyed the most was laying quietly as they either chatted on or slept. It’s as if I had a private conversation with the stars and the sky.  I would see many falling stars and wish on every one of them. I don’t remember the wishes that I’ve made but only the wonderful experience of making them. It always made me feel like a child believing that dreams can come true. I tried staring at the sky from the terrace of my condo unit. But all I saw was the smog and buildings in the city and felt its enclosure. Though everything is convenient to make me feel comfortable with my lifestyle, the city cannot replace the experience of being in the beach or field, gazing at the stars at night. Such experiences that only nature can provide.
