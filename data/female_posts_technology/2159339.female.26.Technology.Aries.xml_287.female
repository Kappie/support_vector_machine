The combination of his floppy platinum hair and his goofy features made me want to dub him "Sir Pee Wee" but that is not the point. He's  actually not that goofy, but someone who's churned out two good pop albums recently: "Life  Death of an American FourTracker" and "Cellar Door." He's got more back catalog, but I have not yet listened to those. It's indie, it's singer-songwriter-y; not epic, or emo, but a good toe-tappin--yet laid-back--listen for your morning busride. He had an amazing bass player in his live band who added some righteous funk to his songs--as funky as you can get for a band of translucent-skinned indie rockers.  Pedro the Lion was next and they were okay. I have copies of two of their albums (thanks W-gal!) and it's bedroom music. You listen to it alone in your bedroom. On repeat. I've listened to them a couple times each but don't know the songs as intimately as their well-behaved yet quietly rabid fans. Their fans were rapt with attention, absorbing the music, and in ecstacy. But for me, the casual show-go-er, PtL didn't do anything. They made no impression on me. He's a good singer, but the PtL show is for fans only who come to hear the songs, because they provide no easy entertainment or showmanship. There's no urgency. They're self-serious and don't crack jokes. And the bassist looks like Al Borlen from "Home Improvement."   After a couple of songs, they took a break to field questions from the audience. This shook me from my stupor and I found this segment engaging. One person shouted out, "What do you think of Pitchfork?" and lead-dude (I dub him "Pedro" from now on) said that he reads  urlLink pitchforkmedia.com  every other day even though they gave the last album a 3.7. Someone else shouted, "What's your favorite book?" and Pedro cited Salinger's "Nine Stories." From the back someone yelled, "Did you ever finish 'The Idiot'?" and regretfully he said no then added, "But it's in my bathroom, if I ever want to pick it up again."   Okay, so they're not that self-serious. But it's not music to shake your hips or flap your elbows too. It's cerebral because the songs focus more on the lyrics (and where that takes you) than the melodies. There are good melodies, but not a lot of hooks. No juicy riffs, no punchy choruses. In conclusion, I left before midnight because I'm old, but I'll still listen to their CDs at home. On repeat even.
