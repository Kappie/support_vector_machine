She's a vegetarian, home-schooling, baha'i free-spirited wonder-mom and I look up to her a lot. Unfortunately she's also kind of random and spontaneous so though we expected her to arrive early yesterday we still hadn't heard from her at 4PM.     If all goes well her family and mine will all be at the cottage tonight. I've offered to make some chinese food; veggie pot stickers, veggie spring rolls, and ma po tofu. I suppose if I have time I could get some green onions at the local vegetable stand and make some onion cake too. It will be nice to spend a few days at the cottage again, I expect to be back early Sunday with lots to reflect on.     Apparently in the time I've been out of the blogging world, the  urlLink Friday Five  has ceased to be. Luckily I found a  urlLink livejournal community for Friday Five enthusiasts . So here goes, I wish I had picked different questions!!     1) Do you remember your first kiss?       Yes, but it was anything but memorable.    2) How old were you when you had your first kiss?       I would guess about 12.    3) Where did your first kiss occur?       Just outside the junior high school (before they started calling them 'middle' school), after a dance.   4) Where do you think is the most romantic place to exchange a kiss? (locations, not body parts)       At the door, because you never know when a parting kiss may be the last memory you have of a person.   5) What type of kisser are you? (peck, smooch, French, sloppy, etc.)       Ok this is the one I didn't want to answer. I confess, I am a bad kisser. I never really learned the right way to kiss, and at present I avoid it when I can. I guess most times I try to get away with just a peck. And yes, I have seriously considered buying one of those 'how to kiss' booklets. I'm really more of a hands-on learner though, maybe I can find a tutor. *winks*
