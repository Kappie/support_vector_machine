We wrote this, together. I wrote a verse, he wrote the next. Back and forth. In anonymity.    Ask me no questions ; Tell you no lies; I must look away ; If you look in my eyes; My secrets are ancient ; Their flames washed in the rain; But where flames once had burned ; The red coals remain.  For too many reasons ; I keep things inside; Although I can trust you ; Some thoughts I must hide; For the sake of some tact ; For my sins or my shame; But you who asks questions ; Are the person to blame.  So let me just be ; let me hide, let me play The questions you ask - I can't answer today Let us keep on our masks ; Don't you dare take my shield Who knows what will happen when my face is revealed?   "Do not be afraid, dear" ; You must say in your heart; You try to get closer ; When I don't make a start; I can't pull the cover ; Made of secret or lie; So don't ask the questions ; Those I cannot reply.
