Whenever I see those green letters overhanging on a building, it is like a beacon of light to me.  It gestures to me without having to flash or twinkle, and says:  come in; put your feet up; sip coffee; read a book.   I would not trade my B for half-price bookstores even with the deep discounts.  Half-price bookstores do not have cafes that serve Starbucks coffee, or serve chicken panini.  They do not have overstuffed couches where you can sit with piles of magazines and books by your feet, while you sip your cappucino and leaf through crisp, unwrinkled pages.  They do not have jazz, classic, elevator music playing in the background.    After a very stressful day last night, I visited the B downtown.  It is on 4th and Commerce St, encompassing about half the block.  I browsed at leisure.  It's funny what comfort rows of bookshelves filled with books can give you, and book lovers know what I mean.  I bought three books.  I felt both guilt and pleasure purchasing them.  But pleasure outweighed the guilt of spending.  I bought two book, each by a favorite author, and another book to discover a new author.  I cannot wait to travel their pages.    urlLink Everything's Eventual by Stephen King     urlLink Silver Wedding by Maeve Binchy     urlLink Brick Lane by Monica Ali
