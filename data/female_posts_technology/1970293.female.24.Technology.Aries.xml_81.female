She really wasn't in the mood to clean especially not at 10 pm.  The baby was put to sleep an hour ago so she didn't have to take care of her.  She really wasn't in the mood to read a book or a magazine.  She hated to be bored.  Usually she could find anything to do.  It wasn't exactly if she was a boring person.  There were lots of things she could do if she was in the mood.  It is just that lately seemed that is all she does all the time.  It's time for something new to do.  But what?  That was definitely the question.  She had some thinking to do first to decide exactly the activity that would keep her interest.  Maybe she could do some aerobics.  That would keep her busy for a little while.  She sighed.
