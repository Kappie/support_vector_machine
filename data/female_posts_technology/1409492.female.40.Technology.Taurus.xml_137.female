Needless to say, mister stressboy has had all his needles pegged in the red for the last week or so.    We did  watch 2 eps of  24  last night; you know, nekkid Keifer might normally be interesting, but not when someone is applying ) scalpels, b) soldering irons, c) and tasers to said nekkid flesh. Those scenes were *not* pleasant to watch. And those White House bastards locked Ensign Ro in a supply closet! Heads will roll when Jack proves to be right once again.   urlLink Endymion  is quite good. I recommend the whole series; just don't ask me to explain what it's about. I  hate  it when someone asks me what a book is about when I'm reading sometimes. I couldn't sum up these books in less than a thousand pages.  It has been a while since I have read anything Dan Simmons has written; he caught my attention with a short story whose title I have forgotten ( Dying in Bangkok ? Behold, the power of the Web:  urlLink his site  confirms it).  It was about a soldier during Vietnam on leave and a vampire-ish monster who, because of her method of sucking blood, had victims literally lined up around the block. I remember it managed to be quite clinical and erotic at the same time. Anyway, I read  Carrion Comfort  and  Song of Kali  soon after that.  Song of Kali  is set to become a movie as is  Hyperion . I doubt either will happen.   Nancy's husband , Mark, sent me this great link: urlLink The bad review revue . Ha, nothing rouses and inspires the poet in a critic more than a crappy movie!  P.S. I'm glad you're okay, Nancy. Sorry about your Saturn. I'm very happy with mine and glad I didn't buy that SUV I was looking at 5 years ago.  Here's another link:  urlLink The Ruthless Guide to 80's Action . This page has reviews of 80's action movies. They spend a lot of time going over the homoerotic subtexts of a lot of these movies (scroll down to the photos of Jean-Claude Van Damme, Chuck Norris, and Dolph Lundgren for a great laugh). They love  Commando  as much as I do. I haven't fully explored this site, so Caveat Emptor.  So besides two links o' the day, I also bring you a word o' the day:    prevaricate    SYLLABICATION: pre·var·i·cate  INTRANSITIVE VERB: Inflected forms: pre·var·i·cat·ed, pre·var·i·cat·ing, pre·var·i·cates To stray from or evade the truth; equivocate.   ETYMOLOGY: Latin praevricr, praevrict- : prae-, pre- + vricre, to straddle (from vricus, straddling, from vrus, bent).    I was reading an interview with my favorite redhead and he used this word. Mmmmmm, I just love it when a man talks wordy!
