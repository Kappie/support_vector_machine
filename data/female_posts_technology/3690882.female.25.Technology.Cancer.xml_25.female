You need to get there atleast 2 hours ahead of time to have any chance of getting anything.  I spent yesterday chasing tickets that were already gone.  From Shakespeare in the Park to the Theater Development Fund, the lines were blocks long right at the moment the office opened.  So in desperation, I started wandering around, looking for a theater that had any tickets left.  I found some tix to Movin' Out.  After that I spent the afternoon lifting weights.  Then I met Lexi at Central Park to rollerblade.  My stride has been getting a lot better.  This complicates things as my ability to brake has yet to catch up.  The problem is that just as I'm right handed, I'm apparently right footed too.  I can keep balance on my right leg much longer than on my left leg.  As the brake is on my right foot, I have trouble keeping balance on my left as I stick out my right to stop me.  It's going to be a while before I become ambifootstrous enough to stop when I want to.  We ate at the Heartland Chop House.  They had the most enormous Prix Fixe.  Lexi got three times the steak she could eat.   We also had their beer sampler.  There was an unfortunate prevalence of fruit flavored beers.  This wouldn't have been a problem, except for the lingering memory of the apricot ale I had along with cold cheese sausage on the fateful birthday fishing trip for Keith.  I'm not totally giving up on apricot ales the way Lexi gave up on Vodka after my 21st birthday, but I have to admit that apricot ale is a lot less pleasant than it used to be.  I found some tickets to Movin' Out, the Billy Joel musical.  Lexi really wanted to see it and I like a few of his songs.  Neither of us expected the new age rock-ballet that we got.  There was no dialogue.  The entire story was told in a combination of the lyrics of Billy Joel's songs and the movements of the dancers.  There was much frantic spinning to demonstrate a whole plethora of emotional vignettes.  They lose the girl, they twirl.  They're fighting paranoia in the jungles of vietnam, they twirl.  They come home and start doing smack, they twirl.  Always, twirling, twirling towards freedom.  We finished out the night by taking another trip on our skates north along the Hudson.  I really love the bike/skate path along the Hudson.  It's nearly perfectly flat and very well paved.  I can really build up some speed on it.  We did about 7 miles round trip and then came home and collapsed in front of the first episode of Babylon 5 season 4.
