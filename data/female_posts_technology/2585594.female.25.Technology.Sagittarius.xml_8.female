Looking at her, it seems possible. Listening to her, however, is a different matter altogether. See, Heidi speaks english like most Filipinos do. Her diction and her expressions shows she's been here long enough. But her grammar and sentence construction say otherwise. She says things like 'Did they won?' and 'I've gone already' which would irk some grammar-compulsive people. But she's a normal Filipina beauty --- big, black eyes, sensuous lips, and that nice kayumanggi color that's in between the brown of blacks and the cream color or whites --- with the sweetness that's characteristic of Filipinos, and it seems like that more than makes up for her lack in grammatical correctness.  Heidi's been working as a secretary for a private law firm since she turned 21. Today, she's sitting at her desk, typing up some paper work, and thinking of going to college.   Damn, I'm too old , she thinks. But then again, she'd heard stories of people older than her who went to college and finished, and made better careers for themselves. She definitely wanted something more for herself than a second-hand Honda she'd bought 2 years ago and a small cluttered apartment she rented with her Filipina friend.  Suddenly, someone's hands covered Heidi's eyes. Heidi panicked for a millisecond before hearing a voice behind her say 'Guess who?'. It was her boss-slash-boyfriend, Cody. Heidi slapped Cody's hand as Cody let his hands down. 'What do you want?,' Heidi asked, trying to keep her voice neutral. The previous night's fight came back into her memory, as she resolved, once again, to break up with him for good, and to not let him coax her into staying together this time around. 'You're so much prettier when you scowl like that,' Code said as he held out a bouquet of flowers he'd bought for her.  'We've gotta talk, Cody,' Heidi started.  *** Bitin ba?, basa ka ulet bukas hehehe. In Pinoy terms, ABANGAN ANG SUSUNOD NA KABANATA.... (hmm...pero 'di naman talaga kabanata, 'di ba, kasi by day 'tong kwento e. hehehe)
