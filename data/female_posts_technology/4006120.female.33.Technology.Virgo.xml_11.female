So I got there just in time, paid the co-pay of $20, sat down, grabbed a copy of  urlLink "O"  in the waiting lounge, flipped through the first 3 pages of the magazine and then the doctor called me in. I don't like my eyes dilated.  So anyway, the doctor went through my records real quick, a little chit chat just to keep a little conversation going. Then he told me I'm not supposed to be there until December. Geez Lewis! I had to get up early this morning so I could come in to work at 7:30am to make up for leaving early today and for nothing? And of course, I have to go through the receptionist again and get all the transaction voided, etc. etc. Crap! Oh well, I'm not going back to work.  A little over a year ago, while I had my routine eye exam at Lenscrafters for my contacts and prescription glasses, my optometrist told me he saw something not quite right, he thought I might have a  urlLink retinal detachment . Whoa!  retinal what?   Budz and I had a conversation once that if I have to choose among the 5 senses which one should I give up last...Sight, Touch, Hearing, Smell and Taste. I didn't have to think hard on that one - the most important sense for me of course is Sight.  I was at Lenscrafters around 5ish then. Somehow, they got it all coordinated so quickly that they were able to set me up for another opthalmology appointment at Kaiser right away - that evening. Normally it would take weeks to schedule in an appointment but this time they were able to get me in so quickly? Now, all this rushing was scaring the hell out of me. My thoughts were already running wild at this time...Am I losing my sight? I'm getting blind! Am I getting an eye surgery? I'm getting blind! Will I be okay? I'm getting blind! waaaa!  I'm tellin ya, getting a  urlLink dilated eye exam  is no fun. Getting your eyes poked and eyelids stretched and eyes poked, two opthalmologist were taking turns doing this, was soooo not fun, it's discomforting! The diagnosis was the same, retinal detachment, it looks like...maybe. So they told me I have to see a retinal specialist. By 7:30pm, I was seeing a Dr. Meffert retino somethin' specialist. I was relieved to say the least. He told me it is not retinal detachment after all and even if it was I have to go in surgery right away. It was considered a medical emergency. The good news was it wasn't. I have urlLink  retinoschisis .  A retina what again? I thought.  It sounded too medical and foreign to me. He was only the 4th eye doctor I saw in the last 2 hours and a half, I should be feeling okay, right?  As it turned out, I  am  going to be okay. I will still see floaters every now and then. I always thought floaters and cobwebs in my sight was normal. Or sometimes I would think they were semi-hallucinations. When I was young around 9 or 10 years old I also thought maybe I had special powers. I can see dead people! Double crap, I was just defective. Now my doctor just need to keep an EYE on my EYES every 3-6 months and make sure it's not getting worse.  My doctor told me this is really not common for women in their 30s.  Well thanks, just what I wanted to hear to make me feel better, very reassuring indeed.  Hmmm, I'll just have to start thinking I'm special this way.  crap!
