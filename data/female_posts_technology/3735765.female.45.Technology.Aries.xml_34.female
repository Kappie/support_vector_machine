We have been through a lot with each other throughout the many years and without each other much for the last couple of years. We have had many good times and many rough times, but seem to hang in there together in the end.  Last week began my college courses online as well. This will be an interesting term with my working and my college courses, as well as her in her senior year at school and taking a college course or two as well....  Hopefully, neither of us will have our hair pulled out in the end..... well, I think we can make it so long as we don't have any major kinks in the road (ie my car died on me tonight after taking her to purchase some school supplies -- nothing like God placing more hurdles for us to cross when it just seems like we have had enough hurdles!!). Please say your prayers for us that we maintain our sanity -- okay??? :)
