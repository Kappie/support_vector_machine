Second time was after my ex-boyfriend B and I decided that it would be best if we never see each other again, ever. Third time was five minutes ago when I put the backpack on too see how heavy it is and one of the plastic straps snapped. I don't know if it's because I don't sleep anymore and it's catching up with me or because I've been working a lot or because I'm scared of spending three days keeping up with boys. So I bawl for a while, make sure I get really ugly, and then laugh at the absurdity of it all. Cracking up. I think that may be what is happening. Today I wrote one of those mandatory pre-vacation emails at work to [#everyone]. It said "I will be gone from 2/27 until 1/2. Please see *** and *** for all your marketing needs". Then, realizing my mistake with the dates, I wrote again to [#everyone] saying "Sorry. I meant 2/27 until 2/2"..Then Rami wrote me "Abby, you meant until 3/2". Yes, I did. But at that point I didn't want to have to write yet another email to #everyone confirming my stupidity. Then I made about 234,542 more mistakes.  Wendy's memorial finally happened . We went to Farallon for lunch. Dr. Bossman's only rule was that we couldn't take any of our food to go as Wendy would have. We had to finish our plates. On the way there K and I worried that it would be a depressing, drawn out affair, but it actually turned out to be quiet light-hearted and dare I say, fun. There were even anorexia jokes flying around. Apparently her death is still pending even though she's been dead for over a month. Her sister is having a problem obtaining the death certificate.  OK. I better finish packing now.
