Shut up and make it official.   The big problem with this is that people ask the woman in the relationship.  If she doesn't have a ring on her finger, chances are that she doesn't know either!  I have been asked this question three times today.  Is it because I talked about my boyfriend or brought it up in any way?  No.  All three came from people I haven't talked to in a long time who wanted to make conversation.  I graciously referred all three of them to my boyfriend if they really want to know.  I should be used to it, after getting the question all the time, but I'm not.  At first, I thought it was a sign that someone cared and was interested in how I was doing.  Now, I feel a bit insulted when people ask.  I don't know why.  It must be my own fault; I have pictures of us together on my desk, many times I answer the "What did you do this weekend?" question with talk about what we did together.  Perhaps people think that having a boyfriend is all I have going on in my life.  On the other hand, between school, Toastmasters, and work, I know I don't give off that impression, either.    I wonder if he gets the question as often as I do.  Chances are, no.  Why do people ask this, when they clearly know the answer?  Any thoughts?  Thanks for letting me rant.
