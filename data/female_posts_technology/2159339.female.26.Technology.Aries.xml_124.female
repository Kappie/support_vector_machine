He did the splits, the fingerwags, the doublespins, the nose pinches, the helicoptering his jacket...   I have seen him a total of 6 times. This is more than I have seen anyone ever. I am officially crazy. I need to know where he lives and if he wants to spend the rest of his life with me. And if I can't have him, (pull out my gun here) NO ONE will! (female screams. BartD looks terrified but still manages to pinch his nose and kick the air.)  Yesterday I spent two hours hanging out on my bathmat reading design books. Green Marble crept down to look for DVDS and I was like, "Hi!" She looked at me like I was weird and said, "How long have you been down here?" and I chirped, "Oh, like, 2 hours!" She said, "What are you doing?" and I said, "Oh, reading. And hiding."   My bathmat is fuzzy and brand new. My bathroom is clean and well-lit. Hemingway knew the importance of these attributes -- it's a good place for reading. Also, I am becoming a hermit. I am shunning my bigger room for the pod which is my bathroom.  I like to think of it as my secret clubhouse.
