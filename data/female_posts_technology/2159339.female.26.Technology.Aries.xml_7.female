We didn't have on fuzzy high heel slippers, but we were both decked out in the bizarre combo of worktop + pajama pants. Are we geniuses or just lazy?  One thing was for sure, we looked really sexy. (And by "sexy", I mean "puzzling".) We squealed at Seth's charm and cuteness, were shocked by Marissa's scheming mother, and I scoffed at Ryan's cuff.  I have problems with Ryan's jewelry/ male adornment. During the first couple episodes, he sported this leather shoestring choker around his thick neck and it looked wrong for his character. Why would a boy from the cuts tie a leather string around his neck? If he was a handsome pretty boy, like aloof Jordan Catalano from My So-Called Life, it would work, but Ryan is too smart to be drawn to prettifying himself! Bad move, costume designer!   Then in this new episode, I breathed a sigh of relief as I saw that the awful choker was gone, but then I saw the leather cuff. I'm sure they're trying to make him hip and relevant to tween trends, but Ryan's too cool for that. Or he's not cool enough. If he wants to look cool and hott, then he should start with a haircut. His hair is so "Ben-from-Growing-Pains" that I'm appalled. Offended, actually.   And that's the news today on Hair, Make-up, and Boys. Byiiieeeeeeee!!!
