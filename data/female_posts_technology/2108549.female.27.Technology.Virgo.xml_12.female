Well, he was amped up and hyper as all get out when we first set out.  So being the oaf that he is, he can't figure out what side to walk on or which path or even how to walk in a straight line.  There is a raised concrete border around the dirt path, its probably 4- 6 inches tall, maybe 4 inches wide.  My boy, goofball that he is, kept jumping and walking on alternate sides of it.  2 or 3 steps on the right of it, 2 or 3 steps on the left of it.  When that got boring he even managed a few steps on this border like a little kid.  Oh how I wished for a video camera.    That dog is the biggest gift I will ever get in my life.
