It was nice to leave work early and not have to use vacation or other time for the break.:)  Funny how after I left no one wanted to do my job for those 4 hours.  I love it.  Sometimes working with boys is just pure entertainment for myself.  3 weeks time and I'll be up north w/ the fam.  It will be cool to hang with the niece and nephew for a week.  Hoping allergies don't kill my days that are loaded with sun.  Hit the doc for annual checkup type o'thing.  I have tennis elbow!  I haven't played Tennis in years.  I guess working is/can be hazardous to one's health. hehe  I will just have to take it a bit easier at work.  Yeah right.  If I don't do it it will just be there for me to do either later or tomorrow.  Aren't I just a lucky one.  Now for those that know me, I'm not complaining, I'm just stating fact.  If my helper-dude was in today, he would be working his nuts off this afternoon.  Glad he'll be workin' Help Desk soon.  They need a real huge brain child there and I want the ref bonus. :D  About a month ago we had an office/practice close and all their equipment was sent back to corp.  I was expecting about 30 computer; however, I got about that many little portable printers and only 5 laptops.  Wonder what the heck happened there.  Well that got me on one of my rampages.  Many are not happy when I start to go off.  Most/sometimes it makes financial sense and I think that ticks people off.  Gee a company that was hurting about a year ago, not to mention is an auditing firm, now doesn't seem to want to tighten that belt again.  Call me silly but just cause we literally land a huge client doesn't mean we can just buy on whims.  Mad some proposals to the boss today with the purchasing person but they still don't see the big ka-ching.  I'm trying to get a bigger bonus outta them but hell if anyone else sees that.  Damn boys.  Trying to get the Fiji stuff finalized and I talked to the agent a bit ago.  Not sure I like the airheaded-ness or the way she doesn't have all my info there in front of her when I call.  I found that a bit strange.  If the whole thing is on hold, wouldn't it all be there together and one try options to any and all of it?  Maybe it's me and the power of the web when I book flights for myself or fam.  Maybe I'll take some time next year, later in the year, and learn how to do all that and giving myself all kinds of discounts. hehe  Well I have to get my act together and get down to Summerfest before it rains again.  Like I can avoid it when I'm down there.  Ah well.  Here it is:  Pleasure of self or Pleasure of Life, more fun?
