I find this to be a problem at bedtime, which is when I do my best fretting and fussing. For some reason, I can only assume it's the lack of food or drink in my belly, I've also been waking nauseous up at 3AM.   To combat this I've pulled a musty, poorly-bound paperback copy of Moby Dick from my bookshelf and started reading myself to sleep by the light of my lava lamp. I've had the novel, and several others, in my possesion since high school. I was lucky to have the opportunity in grade 12 to take on a self-study advanced english class. I feel especially lucky to have the opportunity since my grade 10 and 11 english marks were not so great. Without naming names, I'll just say that the right or wrong teacher can make or break a class. There are teachers with no energy or passion to be in their profession anymore, no urge to actually teach anything, just counting the days to retirement. Those are the teachers we used to make cry. Anyway, back on track here. In my self-guided english class we were required to study two classic novels; one was our own choosing. At the end of the year the pile of novels still sat in a pile on top of a folding table pushed against a cinder-block wall. Being the miscreant that I was, I made off with several of the novels, a few Shakespearean plays, and two books of poetry. To this day I still feel that my action was more of a rescue than a theft.   I am so impressed with the imagery and mastery of words in just the first eight chapters of Moby Dick I felt I had to share my favorites.  "..whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul.." "..and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it.." "Methinks that in looking at things spiritual, we are too much like oysters observing the sun through the water, and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air."  Oh, and there is a reference to something called pea coffee which has me intriqued. I'll have to look that up.
