I wrote another script for our department, I'm ranked 10th out of the department and my peers like me. Imagine that. And what's more, we have a person on our team that is well, perhaps lacking in social skills. Or maybe its a matter of not wanting them. Regardless, when they moved him behind me, I decided I would make friends with him specifically because I did not like him. And we made friends and I found out he is a cool person. Well, his social skills or lack thereof, have gotten him into some manure with management. Oh how I remember the days. The conferences and meetings being toldI was inappropriate, out of line, unacceptable, etc. etc. etc. It wasn't so long ago that I had an awesome manager that told me these things. I remember too the feeling that even if I did improve, all anyone would see was who I used to be. And that was the case and may be the case for him here, thankfully I don't know. My conferences have been nothing short of praise for my attitude, my willingness to help and my overall *perkiness*. Gag me. I am   NOT   perky. Well, maybe a little I guess. So the problem child on our team has now asked me for coaching on when he is out of line, sarcastic or inappropriate. Me? Really? Wow, a few years ago, no one asked me for anything like that.   Its amazing what a little recovery, a lot of God and fresh chance will do for someone like me. I am actually well liked here, not out of fear but because... they really like me.   So bizarre how things change.
