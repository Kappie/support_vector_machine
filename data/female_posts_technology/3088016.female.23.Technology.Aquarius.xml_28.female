The only part I got to hear was the last 30 minutes, but I was disappointed that every single reporter's question I heard had something to do with asking Bush if he had made mistakes, what they were, and whether he had anything to apologize for.  Hello?  Is that important enough to dominate a news conference?  Several alluded to the election that's still half a year away.  It's hard to believe that the media can be so blatantly political.  We take that freedom of political speech for granted so much; my Palestinian co-worker was telling me about how that wouldn't have happened in her country.  I wish it didn't happen in ours, though I agree wholeheartedly with maintaining the right to do so.   [End soapbox]
