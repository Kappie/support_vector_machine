Some great tunes, which I know DC doesn't like :)  But I thought that Ordinary Day was especially appropriate for a discussion yesterday about life and what to do in life, etc.  In particular the chorus.  I've got a smile on my face, I've got four walls around me  The sun in the sky, the water surrounds me  I'll win now but sometimes I'll lose  I've been battered, but I'll never bruise... it's not so bad   Chorus  And I say way-hey-hey, it's just an ordinary day  and it's all your state of mind  At the end of the day,  you've still got to say... it's all right.   See that girl on the street, what keeps her from dying  Let them say what they want, she won't stop trying  She might stumble, if they push her 'round  She might fall, but she'll never lie down...   Chorus  It's a beautiful day, but there's always some sorrow  It's a double edged knife, but there's always tomorrow  It's up to you now if you sink or swim,  Keep the faith and you're ship will come in.
