A rational person will say no. Then why do people think of running away when they meet an obstacle? Ending a life, will it end all troubles? Is that a coward's behaviour? For me, I must be out of my mind, lost my rationale before I can do it.  Will you come out a stronger man? Will you beable to overcome your obstacle and embrace the next one? Will you complain when the road is smooth, and lament when its rough?   It's all in your mind. Things happen for a reason. Open your eyes and mind, look around you. If something can happen to them, it could happen to you too. So try to put yourself in their situation. Learn from their mistakes. The world don't revolve around you. You are given this opportunity, don't waste it.   A journey can hardly be free of bumps or dents. Don't wish that hurdles don't come your way cos it will. Without it, you won't learn, grow or appreciate. Since it's there on your path, you can't do anything about it, why not just embrace and learn to deal with it?  Life is never perfect. Life is never a bed full of roses. I know you have been through hardships, you are not alone. Share your wisdom, and learn from others.   Things happen for a reason. Don't ignore it. Don't you think it make life more colourful?  You come naked, you'll go not taking anything with you. Everything is just a passing dust cloud.
