Naked Truth sat alone, sad and unattired, "Why are you so miserable?" Parable inquired.  Naked Truth replied, "I'm not welcome anymore. No one wants to see me. They chase me from their door."  "It is hard to look at Naked Truth," Parable explained. "Let me dress you up a bit. Your welcome will be gained."  Parable dressed Naked Truth in story's fine attire, with metaphor, poignant prose, and plots to inspire.  With laughter and tears and adventure to unveil, together they went forth to spin a tale.  People opened their doors and served them their best. Naked Truth dressed in story was a welcome guest.   - A Jewish Tale -   Taken from  urlLink Nuda Veritas
