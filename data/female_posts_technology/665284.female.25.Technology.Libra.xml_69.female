Hmmm...to the counter I went and asked to see a copy and confirm if it's a comic book. Now, I read somewhere that there's a disctinction between comics and manga. Some people might take offense and call me "baka." Holler and forgive my ignorance. Anyway, to make a short story shorter, I bought the first ish of QEM.   SIDESWEEPER:   Think You're Under Arrest. A few grammatical errors. Dialogue could be better.   FREE SPIRITS:  Group of friends out for a week of project making and vacation. Medyo naguluhan ako sa panels.   CANTE ISTA:  About four strangers called to a place in Wyoming. Dean Koontsy. Mahilig sya sa "strangers coming together" or "going back to a baaad place."   CAMP BIG V:  Voltes V meets Gate Keepers  I'll wait (like I'm waiting for OTHER issues...ang tagal) for the second ish before I say that I'd rather not buy anymore. Maybe I'm such a manga addict right now that I've reached a point where the reading is flat.   urlLink  www.anime-club.com/extreme
