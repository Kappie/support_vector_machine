And it has been RAINING since I left Highland Tap last night at around midnight. I like to hang out in the Highlands, always have.  We went to not only Fontaine's last night for dinner but hiked it down to Hand in Hand for a drink as well.  Then for some reason, one of our crowd suggested a change in venue to Neighbors.   This would have been fine except for 3 things.  First, when we got there, we added chairs to our table.  (to which the waiter insisted we turn the table around for better traffice flow)  Second, after looking around at the crowd (and feeling like the oldest people there), the same person in our crowd said we should have gone to Highland Tap to begin with.  I suggested we go, having been the one to resist earlier, it was simply because it was beautiful earlier and why miss out by hanging in a bar where you aren't sure if it's day or night? Well one girl in the crowd had actually forgotten her id.  So for the third thing... Ok, we were all in our late 20's, early 30's in this crowd.... so no prob right?  Well, instead of just trying to get in, one girl had a broken id, and passed it along to her.  The first bar we go in, no prob. But they had left Hand in Hand after the other half of the group was already inside Neighbors.  This extremely astute tattoed young lady, who we will refer to as "Bouncer of the Year", saw thru the ruse and immediately began to interrogate the young woman.  To the point of removing her id and taking it immediately to the 18 yr old manager.  (so he could do what exactly?) After a little name calling, and id retrieving, we parted Neighbors and moved to Highland Tap, where happily NO one checked ANY ID'S.  BE CAREFUL WHO YOU PISS OFF, BE CAREFUL WHAT YA SAY Because last night, I ran into someone from my home town... sort of "six degrees" but not even that many.  She is/was best friends with an old ex-girlfriend of my brothers... who (brother) graduated 2 yrs ahead of her. And yes, I was FREAKED out for a bit because... "It's a small world after all, it's a small world after all, it's a small world after all, it's a small, small world!"
