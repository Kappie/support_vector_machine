He says he is going back to be promoted within the Indian firm he works for.  He is actually moving back to get married. His parents gave him a chance to find a "love marriage". After 4 years his time is up and his parents have made a decision for him.  An appropriate girl was found and the marriage has been arranged.  He will meet her for the first time at his brother's wedding. If he does not oppose the marriage - it is likely they will wed within a month.  It is pretty unlikely they will divorce - arranged marriages have a much lower rate of divorce than "love marriages".   How lucky are we to be able to chose our partners. To fall in love.  Or maybe only some of us are lucky. And some of us, those who can't find love on their own, are not lucky enough to have a family, and a society, that will take care of them so that they do not remain alone.   I wonder what will become of H'.  I have never been very good at staying in touch with people from the past - maybe I will make this an exception.
