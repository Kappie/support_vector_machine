But otherwise, it's been good.  I've made good progress on the Slyth scarf, I've pretty much doubled my progress on the sweater, I've considered working on Charlotte (of all my projects, it's hardest to work on her with the cat around, because of course she's attracted to the Good Stuff, not the acrylic blends *grin*), and I made a washcloth, and actually wove ends RIGHT when I finished the knitting!  I NEVER do that!  (No pics yet, still have to block the thing.)  BTW, hi, Secret Pal!  *waves*
