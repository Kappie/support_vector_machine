I love hanging with the guys.  I'd like to do that more often.  Too bad many are taken and aren't allowed out to play. Only part I didn't like was having it all end so early.  Unfortunately when Jen or I work we have to be there until 3 before we get to leave.  Saturday was such a lazy day.  Slept most of the day due to being up almost 24hrs yesterday.  Did get up for a bit and was online.  Today isn't looking too much more energy producing but then again it really doesn't have to.  No kids and cats love to sleep on hot days. Have a great nap everyone.   For those that do not wish to read sexual content - stop now.     Those that are married and keep hitting on me - please stop it.  As much as I like "fun" I also like to have a person that can be with me instead of having to go home to another.  Here's a clue for anyone:  I want to be with someone that loves to have fun, likes the outdoors, loves to travel and be adventurous.  First and foremost, the person has to already be single.  Not married. Not in the process of a divorce.  Not engaged to another.  Current status has to be:  completely single.  I know it can be annoying but deal with. It's what I want and I almost always get what I want.   Question:  What irks you the most?
