Sometimes clouds cover the sun.  But when the go away, the sun is always there. Sometimes rain and storm cover the sun. Again, when the rain goes away, you see the sun. The sun is always there. Clouds, rain, storm, haze, whatever -- they come and go.  The sun is always there. Don't get attached to the clouds, the rain, the storm, the haze. They are temporary.  They don't last long.  They come and go. Detach yourself from these temporary inconveniences.  Free yourself of baggage, ghosts past, worries, fears, superstitions, prejudices, anger, jealousy. Free yourself. It's the sun that's permanent!
