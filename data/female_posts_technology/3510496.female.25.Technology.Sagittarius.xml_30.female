But I am particularly concern with one particular door of our neighbors. Did I mention DOOR?  urlLink    Yes.   1. This particular neighbor's door is facing our door.  2. Their door has traces of red paint splashes  urlLink   , an 'artwork' clearly represents the people we call 'tailong'.  3. To avoid further 'artwork', they 'cloth' the door with plastic sheet, clad along with a Letter of Notice from the police  urlLink    that their unit is under camera surveillance.  4. So far our Door is undisturbed. But should any same case happen to us, we won't contemplate to report to the police and 'cloth' our door.  5. So far, the splashing has ceased. BUT the 'tailong' are still showing off their 'artwork' all over the walls on our level plus all the pillars at our voideck; stating our neighbor's unit, the amount they owe and other unknown chinese characters (which I believe it to be some warning statements). Poor the janitors had to clean up the 'artwork'.  The occupants of that unit seems too refine to be chased after the not-so-refine. Perhaps it could be a case of mistaken unit.   Friends   Poems commonly 'splashed' in those days autograph books:  "True friends are like diamonds, precious and rare.  urlLink      False friends are like dried leaves, scattered everywhere."  urlLink     To false friends of others out there, or I would rather call the fair-weathered friends, please do not take advantage of your friends by simply 'piercing' in and out of their lives, at the cost of them not wanting to be judge as fair-weathered ones.
