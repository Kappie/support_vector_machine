I would venture to say it was a test of mind of over matter.   Here's what went down:  I get there. After waiting for a bit, the MRI tech approaches me (what a hottie!) and guides me towards the changing room. I put on the robe. A few minutes later, I am guided to the MRI room.  I lie on the MRI table. There's aluminum foil - or something like it - under the sheets.  I can feel it crackling under me.  The tech comes up to me and explains the process: The bed will slide into the MRI machine. I will hear noises: clicks, clunks, hums, rumblings - that's all normal. I have to be VERY CAREFUL not to move AN INCH. This is the most important thing, or the results won't be good, we'll have to redo the test. (I've waited over a month for this exam).  I am given a headset (covered in sterile paper). I put it over my head.  "I just need to position your hip" - he puts his hand on my hip bone and asks me to scoot over a bit.  ("Damn, why didn't I shave my legs!??") "OK - You're going in" he says. "I would recommend you close your eyes".  I do.  The bed start sliding back into the machine.  Once it's reached the position, I hear the tech's voice in my headset. "Are you okay?". Yes. "Okay - we'll get started with the first one. This will last 1-1.5 minutes". Okay.  One and a half minutes are a LONG time when you're asked not to move an inch.  I feel my breath as it hits the MRI machine in front of me - it must be very close. I fight a feeling of claustrophobia.  I want to open my eyes - but I don't dare. I'm afraid I'll get scared of what I see - and I'll flinch - which means I'll move - and ruin the scan. I keep them closed.  The machine is clicking and humming all around me. Louder than I had expected.  It's so hard not to move... my muscles feel cramped.  Then it's quiet.  The tech's voice again. "Are you okay?". Yes, I am. "That was good. This next one will take 5-6 minutes. Don't move".  5-6 minutes!!???!! Oh my - that will be hard. I didn't get a chance to readjust myself before the noise started again. A different kind of noise this time - sound like machine guns. My hips getting warmer and warmer... strange sensation.  My right leg flinches. "Shit!" I think. did I ruin the scan?  I open my eyes just a crack.. then I open them all the way.  The inside of an MRI machine is much smaller than I had expected. It's a tiny white tunnel, with long lights running through it. I feel like I'm in a tube. Or maybe a launching pod in one of those Sci Fi movies. I bet this is what it feels like it you're kidnapped by aliens.  More humming, more clicking, more noise. It takes all my concentration not to move. 5 minutes feel like a lifetime.  Then silence.  The hottie in my ear again (he sounds so far away). "How are you doing?". Okay. "This next one will be our last. Here we go".  Damn, he didn't tell me how long this one will last - will it be shorter or longer than the last one. I hope it's shorter.  The ticking and humming around me becomes monotonous - like white noise. My hips are really warm. My back is too. The minutes creep by and I try not to move. This is the most uncomfortable I've ever been. My left side is cramped, I wish I could stretch. Why didn't I stretch between scans? How much longer will this last?  Okay - maybe I should take advantage of this time and just think - abut things I don't have time to think about everyday - like my future, what I want to do in life. I can't concentrate. Damn I'm cramping! Did I move? Did I flinch?  Okay - maybe Yoga: deep breathing. long, deep breaths. Oh no, the breaths made me move!? Will it ruin the scan?  This is taking so long.... (I later found out the last scan took 15 minutes. Fifteen!!)  Finally, finally silence.  Hottie in my ear: "Good, are you okay?" yes... barely a whisper. "Let me just check that the scan came out all right and we don't need to redo anything".  I hold my breath.  "Okay! you're coming out!" The bed slides out. Hottie is there... It's over.   Now the wait begins for the results.   P.S. He asked me if I was having problems "voiding". I felt silly asking "what do you mean"... but I did. So for those of you who may be in a similar situation - "voiding" means going to pee.  and no - I don't have any problems :-)
