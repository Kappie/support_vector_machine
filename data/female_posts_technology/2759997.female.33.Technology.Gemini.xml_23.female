It’s my own version of "Cheers", with the added bonus of trivia.  We'll call it "E".  Unfortunately, my friends and I are not always allowed to enjoy ourselves without the (most often) unwanted interruptions from other guests.  Highlights from this past weekend include the discovery that L and my trivia names are anagrams of “Cheap” and "Easy” and subsequent conversation that ended with the plan to film a Cheap and Easy adult film, and an offer by a misguided (but admittedly, adorable) waiter to allow one of us to “squirt the food out of his mouth”.    Past experiences have included offers of marriage, propositions by hotel guests, and the famous (but never on the menu) 7-inch sausage special offered time and again by yet another misguided (and measurementally challenged?) employee.  Fortunately, these experiences haven’t deterred from the enjoyment of E – where everybody knows my name (and it ain’t Easy).
