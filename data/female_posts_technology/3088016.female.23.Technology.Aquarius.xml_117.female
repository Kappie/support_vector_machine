I apologize to all two of you who read regularly; here is my attempt to update again.   To my credit, there are several external factors upon which I can blame my blogging negligence:  - Kelly having given me the audiobook version (unabridged!) of the  urlLink DaVinci Code .  - Several things going on at once, including starting a running program, more Toastmasters stuff, more work to do at the office (which hints to job security, so I'm happy), and school.   - Working on getting everything in to UH by the right deadlines for admission into the Electrical Engineering degree program, and subsequent activities after being accepted to said program.  - Editing  urlLink Kelly 's updated resume.   But of course, in the long run, I can only blame it on one lasting factor:  - Laziness.
