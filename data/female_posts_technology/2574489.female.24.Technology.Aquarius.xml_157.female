Friday night last week, I shooed my co-worker and his wife out of their home to take care of their 2 sons, "Ko" and "Ja", aged 4 and almost-2 yrs. old, respectively.  You would think that the boys would dispel some of the allure of being a mother. You would think they'd be rowdy boys, unruly, loud and hard to handle. My co-worker's dog was harder to take care of. Ko and Ja were absolute angels and the 2 year-old came to me so easily, without fuss.    Baby-sitting them did not help. Instead, I was charmed by their innocence, their angelic smiles. How can I not fall in love with boys that smell like angels?   It's so difficult to wait. But we're not ready. I'll just babysit again next week.
