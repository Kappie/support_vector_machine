Some examples of this harsh treatment includes how the manager of the theater was unwilling to help him enjoy the theatoical proformace. How he had to carry a bottle of urine fourty blocks because there was not a suitable restroom for him to use. I really found it instresting on how he tells us about the proposal for handicapped accessible public restrooms on public streets and how the city opposed puting them in because the Public Art Commission had stated that the structure were just too ugly. No one should have to feel insucure just because they have a disability. They should have the same rights as everyone else. No matter what your race, age, or type od disability you have.
