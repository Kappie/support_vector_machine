He wasn't mad, (he sure seemed mad) but he didn't like some of the stuff I said. Well, I wouldn't have either. I was defensive and mean. Of course, he said some things that hurt me a little too. Probably for the same reason.  But is the phone call enough? Not in my insecure little world. So I text message. Are you sure we're ok? Yes we're ok.   Do I feel better now?  A little. I feel annoying and childish, but I feel better.  I hate myself sometimes. I wish I could just turn it off. Once my brain kicks into high gear, look out. There has to be a better way for me to handle myself when I get like this.  But I don't know of one.
