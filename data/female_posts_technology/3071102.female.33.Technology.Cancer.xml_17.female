I always enjoy watching him sing and play.  It was quite a contrast to see him play by himself last night, and not with the entire band like several weeks ago. He is extremely talented, and I enjoy seeing him alone or with the crowd of his band.  If you see a posting for Big Vessel or Chris Jackson, I highly recommend that you go!
