You hate at least 75% of the people you work with. 4. You avidly wait for the weekend. 5. You start BLOGGING during your work hours.  This is one of those days when I wish I could just go home and sleep. I had a really LONG day yesterday (imagine going on 1 day- overseas trip!) and I was thinking of going on leave. As if I could do that! I think my presentation yesterday worked because the prospect is already requesting for a proposal from us. The problem is, the deadline is next week. Oh well, what can I do? You can't really demand from the client that they change their time frame and wait for us right? So I only have today and tomorrow to do the information gathering, requirements analysis and writing the usual marketing shit I include in proposals. I think I'm already getting an ulcer.   Gosh, this work is killing me. If only I had enough money, I would pack my bags and leave tomorrow. But what I have saved isn't enough. I still need to bear with this for 13 months more. Actually, if I had not been practical for the last 3 years of my life, I should have left this company a long time ago. I just always had a reason to stay like, "I need to wait for my bonus." or "Ooopss...they offered me a better job." But every additional year I spent here, made me feel like my life was being sucked out of me.   I think I'm hitting rock bottom right now. I feel like an empty shell, a being without a soul, simply floating across this desert called lfe. I just need more time to fix my financial status. Unlike some people who can depend on family memebers to help them out, I am completely on my own. So if I quit, I need to make sure I can support myself for at least 6 months of bumming around.
