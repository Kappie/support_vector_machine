Er, your moms’ place I meant to say. I didn’t go there on my own because, you know, every opportunity to check out the hotness that is you, well I’m taking it.” Kendall: “I don’t understand. And by don’t understand I mean that I do understand but we need to have the same conversation 400 times a week.” Ryan: (in a tone that would offend even Miranda) “Good thinking Greenlee. And by good I mean retarded but thanks for playing. Right now Kendall is number one but according to the scenes for tomorrow you’ll be number one then and I’ll be breathing on you. Go home and wait.”   Kendall: “Shut up frontal lobotomy. Greenlee, if Lesbianca ever has to go away to, say, a mental institution then you and I should do the whole subtext thing together. You have great eyeshadow and nice arms. Do you work out?” Greenlee: “Uh huh. (flips hair)” Kendall: (licks lips.) Ryan: (breaths with mouth open.)  Babe falls out of bed and goes night-night on the floor.  Krystal with a K stops objecting quite so loudly that Tad is a wack job for saying perhaps it was Bess that didn’t make it when she has flashbacks to some scenes where her doped up, blood fevered daughter said the same thing.  The cops show up to “help” Adam but Tad pretends he’s a doctor and that Adam is the number one loony escaped from the bin. And after much finger wagging  (cops), hair shaking (Adam), bodacious ta-tas in your face shoving (Maria) and smirking (Tad) the cops leave. Jamie, back from holiday at the Dinah Shore open, wakes Babe up from her nap. They bond. Who (whom?) is the bigger girl in that scenario?  Brooke staggers along and Tad hands her Adams’ leash. It’s not short enough if you ask me. And where the hell is Mary?! Her evil antics in all this are sorely missed. Aidan shows up. He and Tad hold hands and skip off to “find Lesbianca.” Uh huh. Aidan is so pretty. Maggie asks Babe to cut Lesbianca some slack and love her like the saint she is (Oh sister she’s so already there) but then she whines about it so much that Babe begins to have an anxiety attack.  You can tell she’s thinking, “Yikes! If this head case is all for letting Lesbianca roam free with my baby then there has to be something wrong.” Good work Maggie! Yet another rack scared away from your not girlfriend.  Erica (in a scene clearly shot 2 weeks ago) chews a massive amount of scenery at the funeral home. There were some really nice flashbacks though. Even some from the 80s.  At the very end of the episode Greenlee shows up At Erica’s, takes in the freak show Lesbianca is putting on and flips her hair. There was more stuff with Reggie, Bobby, Anita etc. but it was too boring for words. I do think I’ve figured out the lip-gloss factor. Only one woman at a time per scene is allowed to have on copious amounts of it. I still don’t know how they decide whose turn it is.     Bloody hell still no Lena.
