I'm not sick of having an opinion though so I will say that, live, Steven Merritt is a magnificent grump. He doesn't say much when he performs leaving the between-song banter to the girlish and dorky Claudia. Partway through, someone from the audience shouted out, "San Diego Zoo!" and he grumbled, "No requests, please." When he sings, his voice is low and sonorous like a cello and I envy his lyrics and knack for clever rhymes.   Opening for TMF was an acoustic folkie singer-songwriter from Australia whose name I forget. At the end of his set he had his friends play some rhythm (cowbell?) from the back of the theater and it was a hilarious disaster. "Tempo! Tempo!" I mock-complained but the enthusiastic arhythm continued. It was like hearing two different songs being played at the same time, one from the stage and one from the last row. It was unintentionally cacophonous. This is why I love live performance: the spontaneity and the mistakes that ensue; the potential for either transcendance or comic disaster.  Fuck. I just wrote a review. Anyway, here's a fuller one below if you want more in-depth analysis. Just click on Steven Merritt's face. I really dislike Neva Chonin's writing style, but I guess Aidan Vaziri didn't get assigned this show.   urlLink
