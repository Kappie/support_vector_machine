I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop and I am terrified of what it will be.    So my choices are fear or anger.  Fear to me, is an emotion of inaction.  Its paralyzing in its grip and it causes me to freeze up.  Anger is an action emotion to me.  I run fast. I drive fast. I talk fast. I react fast. I do fast.  Fear is simply not an option so I'm angry.  It makes no logical sense and this angers me even more.  That I can be so stupid, so illogical.  Knowing that my fears are illogical or at the very least, somewhat improbable.  Its sort of like the notion of winning the lottery.  Oh sure, its a possibility but not a very probable one.  I can intellectually tell myself this stupid all I want, it doesn't make the fear go away.   Yep, I'm a big girl and big girls don't get scared and they don't cry. So what am I so damn afraid of.   I'm scared that I can't do this job.  Scared that I can't adapt to the routine of working again.  Scared that I can't remember how to be a tech support agent. Scared that they won't like me.  Scared that they will find out "who I really am". Scared that everything negative I have ever thought about myself will be confirmed in one day.  Scared that this new way of trying to live is going to collapse and I will be left in a limbo of not being to able to live in the old ways and not able to grasp the new ones.  Just plain scared.  So my option is to freeze entirely or get pissed off about it.    I want to hold everyone at bay for fear if they see me like this they will run. I am tired of needing support and guidance, tired of needing period.  I am getting disgusted with myself and while my life is yes, finally pulling itself in the right direction, that scares me even more. It boils down to this: I don't particularly care for me therefore no one else can and once they realize how inadequate, bad, needy, stupid, incapable I am, they will leave anyway, so I might as well give them that push in the other direction.  Because you see if I push them away its my decision and it won't hurt as bad.
