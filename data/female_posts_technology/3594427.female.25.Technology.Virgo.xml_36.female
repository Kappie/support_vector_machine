When she would ask everyone to stand up and sing, I would sit down in defiance. Even when she threatened to report me to the guard, I would just look at her. Once, I even had the audacity to turn my back on her when she was talking to me. I mean, why did I have to do what everyone else was doing anyway? Out of sheer embarassment, my mother pulled me out of class.  My mother thought she would be able to raise me to become a proper little lady. So she got this crazy idea of enrolling me in ballet class. I ended up being the little terror who pushed all the kids around while they were balancing on one leg. I think she would have had more luck placing me in a martial arts class then.  When I was a little older, my Mom sent me to a summer class in some finishing school where girls were taught how to walk properly and behave properly. In one of the classes I had to take, my teacher didn't believe in the theory of evolution. So at 12 years old, I was already debating against a guy who was probably 20 years older than me about why Creationism simply cannot be scientificaly proven.  In High School, I remember we also had another debate in class regarding artificial contraception. Out of 45 people in my class, I remember being 1 of the 5 people who stood up and said that it is not evil. Everyone else still believed in Catholic teachings.  In college, I took a course everyone else thought was useless and joined a sport very few girls dared to.  Don't even talk to me about my Dad. I don't think I ever followed anything he said. My Mom knew that I was very hard to control, so she just resigned herself to the fact that I would always do things the way I wanted to. She just hoped for the best that I wouldn't get myself into too much trouble.  Today, somebody told me that I am wasting my opportunities by leaving Singapore. Duh?!!! The only reason why I got here is that I seized every opportunity that came my way. A lot of people stay in jobs they hate because they never have enough guts to get out and take the risk. The reason why I am getting out anyway is that I believe there are other opportunities out there and other adventures to be taken.  80% of people I know are deceived into thinking that security means having a big, fat bank account, a stable job, a nice house in the suburbs and a conventional family setup. Sometimes I wish I could be like everyone else, but I really don't think that's for me at this point in my life. Most of the time, I don't think it ever will be.  I don't know, I wish it were easier to explain why I am doing what I am doing. All I know is, I just have to.
