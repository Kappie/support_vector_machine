I find that when I have a problem in any area of my life, social, family, career, personal, whatever it may be... something goes horribly wrong in all.  I hate uncertainty.  I hate not knowing... I'm not a control freak but I like to have some semblance of control when it comes to the outcome of certain situations in my life...   My Career:  I graduated with a BBA in Finance and Real Estate only to find out... I HATE IT!!! My first job out of college was in Insurance... I realize at this point, "Alicia, you couldn't sell water to a dehydrated man in the Sahara."  So I started my search and found something to do that I was happy doing.  I'm a behind the scenes kind of person.  I do what I do well... I get along with most of the people I work with, but I'm not happy with the person I work for.  It's the WHITE MAN's WORLD... that's for sure.  And being a non-white woman, makes it just a little harder...   My Social Life:  I have none.  I've grown into a hermit.  I'd rather be sitting doing nothing than to do something and realize that I'd rather be home doing nothing.  My idea of an exciting night is... MORE THAN ONE MOVIE FROM BLOCKBUSTER... Or a marathon of the World Series of Poker.... But I'm good with this... You can't get into trouble at home...   My Love Life:  Something else I don't have.  The most uncertainty lies here.  I don't know what to say, when to say it, what to do... You get the point.  I don't know how to feel about the situatuon.  I don't even know if I should feel anything. It kinda hurts when someone barrels into your heart and become so much to you and you realize you're nothing to them.   My Family:  Old West Indian people can try my damn patience... "HOLLA, if you hear me!"... Enough said...
