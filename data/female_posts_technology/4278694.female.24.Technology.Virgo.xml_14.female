My apologies in advance for most of this blog being pretty much dribble about Ireland, Irish stories, and Irish news articles, as that is what I hope my show will shape up to be.  As for the title of the blog?  Check out this news article about the smoking ban in Ireland and the largest complaint so far a few months into the ban:   urlLink http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3854699.stm   If you read down, you will see that one of the complaints about the ban is that now that the smell of smoke is gone, it has unmasked the smells of the drinkers' farts.  Dude!  How funny is that?!  If anyone sees any more articles about Irish curiosities, please post them in comments.  I never know where my inspiration for my writing will come.   Later!
