Isn't the world today one made of our collective will? Isn't this progress? Aren't things better today?    Oh to be like Audrey; charming, demure, delicately feminine. In the movie she has all the power she wants at her command, but it doesn't fulfill her. And him, the leading man; hard, focused, selfish. Suddenly he finds his heart softened by her young enthusiastic spirit. I'm not afraid to admit it; it's what I want.     Fuck you feminism; I have my career and my house and thank you for that. I thank you for the right to vote. But it is my choice to want to be with a tall and dashing man. To want to cook for him and look nice for him. It is not wrong that I want to groom myself, to look pretty like a girl should be!     Fuck you mainstream media; I do not have to show my ass crack to be beautiful. I do not want your metrosexual with his 5 o'clock shadow and faded jeans. I do not want your whiny, 'my dick is small and I masturbate too much' professing emo boy.     As with everything else it seems, I refuse to take sides. I will find my leading man, and I will define my life and my relationships on my own terms. Amen and praise be to me!
