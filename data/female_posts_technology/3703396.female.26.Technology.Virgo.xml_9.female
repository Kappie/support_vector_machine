Small pieces of each character set are identifiable, and they have had interesting plot lines and interjections since the beginning.  However, I have to ask, has is started heading south?  I caught the replay of the newest "Episode 41: In Case of Rapture" last night on HBO2.  Of course, these are just my personal opinions, and should only count as such.  The role of Arthur, causing turmoil between Mom and her new husband, seems somewhat pointless.  We understand that he is jealous because he wanted a relationship with her, but does he have to go so far as to look up words in the dictionary to prove himself right, or ask for replenished yogurt from her man?  Next there is the relationship between David and his boyfriend Keith.  I enjoy the drama of their relationship, with the breakups and makeups of a gay relationship.  Why do we have to then realize David is making poor decisions with the plumber?  It just didn't make any sense to me.  If anyone were to cheat, I'd have thought it would have been Keith, not David.  Then, why did he tell Keith?  Even more curiously, why did Keith laugh about it?  I'd have been really upset.  We all know where Claire is headed with the newest character, Edie (played by Mena Suvari).  Of course she's heading into bisexual territory with her art-girl curiosity.  Let her go there, and break her eye open.  Go Claire, have a blast.  At least you won't have to worry about another abortion.  I won't bother commenting on Nate and his inability to cope with Lisa's death, other than it is a little too obvious.  Nor on Rico's cheating frenzy with the stripper... but why buy her DVD players and knee surgeries?  Whatever.  After so many seasons, when a show becomes popular enough, it always seems to head south.  I am hoping that Six Feet Under doesn't get as bad as the last season of the Sopranos.  Please, let it die first!
