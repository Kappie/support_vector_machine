           
      ..... i'm happy, i'm feeling glad, i got  an orange ball  in a bag....  after over a year of no contact... finally my jesseman is back!  so quick version: after losing contact with someone who was my best friend for a while, today he signs on .... and no contact is no longer. two weeks or so until he gets back into clearwater, and i can't wait to have my best friend back...
