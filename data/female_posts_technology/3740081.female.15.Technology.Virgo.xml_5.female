Whatever.  ---Getting Blink-182 cd.  ---Playing songs on my keyboard out of sheer boredom.  ---Going to see Spiderman 2   Finally, I found something interesting that Rydia told me. She says that they are considering Ralph Fiennes, among other actors, to play Voldemort. NOOOOO! THAT IS WRONG!!!!!!! Maybe they've chosen him all ready, I don't know yet. We'll soon find out. But he is not Voldemort, I tell you! He's Remus Lupin! Anyone else up for him and Mr. Thewlis to change places? I am. Voldemort is not suppost to be good looking, and Lupin is not suppost to be bad looking. *groans*
