Base model, but with 4 wheel drive, side airbags, and XM Satellite Radio... I couldn't think of a better vehicle for me. It rides like an oversized Cadillac, which is exactly what I was looking for.     This sweeeetride replaced my 1992 Lumina APV minivan, with 169,600 miles. Quite an upgrade, I must admit! I'm so glad I have A/C again!
