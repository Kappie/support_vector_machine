A Silly Poem   Something wild, something gay whatever happened to me today? On the road, sitting here it's been a while since I had a beer. Dark outside, blinking lights, my butt is aching, wanna say goodnight. Where are you? Come to me. Go away! Let me be. Silly me...  *Found my poem still posted in the Pacific forum.
