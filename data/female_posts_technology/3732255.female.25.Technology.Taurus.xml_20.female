Singer/guitarist Ryen Slegr had this to say on the subject:   "Dear ozma fans,  I regret to inform you the band has called it quits. It's been a pleasure to get to know all of you at the shows and through the forum, you’ve all helped our band be all that it could and for that I am personally thankful. It would be impossible to explain all the reasons for our decision due to their personal nature. These problems have affected the creative and professional facets of the band to the extent that no one feels like continuing any longer. Though I personally wanted to wait to make this decision and give everyone the opportunity to think things over, in hopes that something might be salvaged, certain members felt the need to end things as quickly as possible. Therefore, I see no point in waiting even a few more hours to let all of you know what’s happening. Again, I'm sorry to have to tell you this. I'm telling you this without the consent of the other members of the band, though based on our most recent discussion less than an hour ago I believe the decision to be final and this to be accurate information.  Thanks for the memories and all the kind words over the years that kept us going. Please continue to listen to the music as you always have and remember us as we once were. The forum will remain in operation for the next 2-4 months.  Sincerely,  singer/guitarist  Ryen Slegr"   Drummer Patrick Edwards has recently added to the post on the website, simply affirming Ryen's post and thanking the fans for supporting the band.   Bassist Daniel Brummel is expected to continue playing with the Elected; no word on where the members of Ozma will end up.   Via  urlLink punknews.org
