For those who are just now tuning in, I'm a programmer, so here are some of my favorite sniglets from  urlLink WhatIs .  I won't list them all here because there are too many.    urlLink alpha geek  - the most knowledgeable, technically proficient person in an office or work group.    urlLink assmosis  - the process by which some people seem to absorb success and advancement by kissing up to the boss rather than working hard.     urlLink blamestorming  - sitting around in a group, discussing why a deadline was missed or a project failed, and who was responsible.    urlLink cube farm  - an office filled with cubicles.   urlLink oxoxomoron  - a person who includes symbolic "hugs and kisses" at the end of their e-mail.    urlLink stress puppy  - a co-worker who seems to thrive on being stressed out and whiney.
