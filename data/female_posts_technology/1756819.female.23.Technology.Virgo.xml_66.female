It was kind of nice to be able to talk to the girls on a more one-to-one level.  We sat in a circle and talked about our holidays.  I had an activity involving Bible verses and the names of God which they enjoyed.  I wrote out Bible verses on pieces of paper and put them in a hat.  The girls took turns picking one out, reading it, then matching it up to one of God's names on a poster board.  Then one of the girls suggested we read our favourite Bible verses, which I thought was a great idea.  One wanted to read Psalm 119...but then decided it was too long :)  Overall a good evening.
