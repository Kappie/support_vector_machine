My nerves were calmed about it when I had my consultation and learned about all the measures they take to make patients feel comfortable: Valium the day before and morning of the procedure, a cold spray before the IV, 'Twilight' sedation, local anesthesia, and of course, a lot of great drugs once I'm done.  My co-workers have encouraged me to post on the blog tomorrow when I'm at the height of drugginess.  We'll see.  My Oma (grandma to non-Germans) is taking me to the appointment, and Wayne has kindly volunteered to be my nurse while I recover.    I know that I'm trying to diet, but I won't be able to eat solid foods for a while.  Therefore, this afternoon's dinner (before class, so it was early) I had the super-carb feast from La Madeline.  I helped myself to creme brulee and a french dip, and didn't feel the least bit guilty.      I even got a phone call from the receptionist at the oral surgeon's office this morning to confirm, and I found out that I only owe $387, when I had expected to pay $1600.  They're trying to push it through dental insurance instead of the high-deductible medical that I have.    Overall, I feel comfortable going into tomorrow's surgery.  One of my colleagues today made sure to remind me of the dangers I could face, including a blood clot reaching my brain and the possibility of chipping my palate bone.  Just what I need.   Keep me in your thoughts and prayers.  I hope to be back here to post.
