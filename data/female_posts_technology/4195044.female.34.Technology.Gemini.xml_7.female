I have typed in more than a million words and boom *&^%$! in a snap it was gone.  Don't you just hate that!? GGGRRRRR... Jammer! Ugh.  I was supposed to be talking about that *big yawn* cliched household chores... and how I am sooo glad that my Dutchman isn't a Chauvinist Pig! Har har har!  Perhaps next time, I will extrapolate the matter. For now, we can dwell on the idea that Dutchman is a GOOD PICK! *wink*
