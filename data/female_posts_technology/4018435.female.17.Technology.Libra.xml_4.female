It was pretty fun. A lot different from the european habbo. Actually, slightly better.   My head is hurting, my eyes are sore, my ears are ringingand my back is in pain. Melanie and Jasmina were sweet enough to invite me out to the club tonight cuz they wanted to cheer me up. When we got there we were in for SO much fun! IT was foam night and the place was packed! I'd never been before, but I had enough fun to take things off my mind. It was sooo kool! The foam came out of this big black can thing hanging from the ceiling and dropped over everyone. Imagine the look on my mom and dads face when I got home at 3 am. Well, mom expected it. Dad looked a bit stunned by the fact that I was drenched. Thanx Jas and Melly!   There were a few icky guys that tried putting their hands all over me. Boo urns to them. But man, it was great dancing all night and raiding the boxes and cages. At the end of it we were soaked. Melanie and I ended up changing i the parking lot. She had no idea when she was changing her shirt that there were a few guys watching her from behind. I just thought, fuck it, and changed my shirt there and then while melanie started talking to the guys saying "oo it's cold. sorry you gotta see me change like this!" Lmao, as if they minded. Woo hoo! Fake phone numbers are great! We took theirs but mel just handed them a digit off piece of paper.    I'm actually pretty hungry. My stomache is aching... Hmm...my grandma offered to send me to las vegas sum tiem this summer or sumwhere else in teh states to get things off my mind.  The other day she gave me a matching bracelet and necklace that say "friendship stones" on the box. I told her I'd put it away. Then she hugged me and started to cry while I did and she said "You are too beautiful. There are so many more men out there. You'll find someone who will treat you the way you deserve to be treated. You know that no matter what I will always be here for you." That's about when I started bawling...  I'm considering where to go now. I'm most likely not going to the phillipines because ther's a high risk of me getting sick there due to the heat and my asthma. Maybe I'll go to Las Vegas or San Francisco. It'd be really nice to go back to LA and see the places I usetago to...The problem is, I don't know the family that well down there anymore and well...I don't wanna go traveling alone.   I really do need to get things off my mind. I just wish I had the right people here to support me. Here I am. Lonewolf. Numero Uno. Start back at one. Who knows that will become of my life. It'll be interesting to watch...  -Lonewolf
