My face is now about the size of a basketball and I can't move it enough to talk in a normal voice.  Something tells me this will not all be gone by tomorrow, which is when I said I would be going back to work.  I won't be returning before I'm well enough, but I hate to call in just because I underestimated my recovery time.  I'm also anxious to be able to do things like talk, eat, work, and be normal.  It's one of those damned if you do (or don't) situations: either I'm drugged and feeling good, or I'm in pain but coherent.     Wayne has been a total sweetheart through all of this.  He's run around to get me smoothies, ice cream, movies, soup, and anything else he thought I would need.  Even the moral support is extremely valuable.  I don't know what I would have done without his help.    I don't really have anything else to post on, since I've done close to nothing for several days.  Saw the "Beverly Hillbillies" today, and "Matchstick Men" yesterday.  "Something's Gotta Give" was the day before that.  Maybe I should have been more productive with this time and become some kind of movie buff, but that takes energy.   I'll write more when I'm up and running again.
