Writing this down is more for my benefit so I can keep track of what I'm eating, but it's also for you make any suggestions etc. If I like the way this goes, I'll do it everyday.  Breakfast: banana  Snack: Almonds and peanut butter - random I know...but that's what happens when you don't pack a lunch - what ever is left over from friday looks good! Lunch: Greek Salad, two handfuls of organic corn chips with avacado spread.    Snack: Two more handfuls of corn chips, 1/4 Cantalope   Dinner: Chicken with salad, TCBY Yogurt for dessert, Nectarine for snack     Exercise: 30 minutes of weights during lunch
