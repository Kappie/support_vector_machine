XX accused me of being cynical, which I think is untrue. I can be quite sarcastic and funny in a mean raunchy way, but I'm not cynical. Cynicism = pessimism. Cynics sit in their armchairs and complain about the state of the world. They mock institutions and scoff at the condition of humanity, but they don't try to change things. I don't attend this school of thought because I'm too busy trying to glue two pieces of felt together. I used to be cynical and ridicule the ridiculous, but I realized I'm pretty ridiculous myself.   This weekend was spent decorating a CDcasebook that W-gal gave me. My muse:  urlLink Side 2 of Beatles vinyl ; my medium: felt, thread, and glue. I learned to embroider and execute a french knot. I did the backstitch until my eyes ached and my back hurt. I sewed on a sequin where the hole in the record goes. I used yellow thread to outline the bulb-like shape in the cross-section of the apple. In the end, it looked spectacular, but upon closer admiration of my handiwork, it actually really looked like a vagina. The bulb-like shape evoked the labia majora and the sequin was a big glittering clitoris. I showed Abby my masterpiece but warned her, "looks like a vagina" and she laughed at my deprecation. But upon scrutinizing the stitching closely, she exclaimed, "It  does  look like a vagina!" She placed her finger on the sequin and I yelled protectively, "Hey! You're touching the bean!"   5 reasons I feel positive today : --- Yesterday I won tickets to see  urlLink The Lovemakers  off Live 105. Thanks Disco Sean! ---  urlLink Soundcheck . Sunday nights on Live 105. Yesterday they played Blonde Redhead, The Start, and Stellastarr. Disco Sean (the sometimes DJ) is knowledgeable about good music and filled with fun facts and gossip. I see him at a lot of the shows I go to and he looks like Peter Brady. He's really nice too.  ---a silvery mesh scarf that I saw downtown yesterday. I am quietly gathering items for my Halloween " urlLink Sleepy Jackson " costume.  ---I applied for a new job. ---my roommates and my show buddies. I can talk in shorthand out of my derriere and my roomies know what I mean. I have show buddies who go to even more shows than I do and who are low down with the downlow. --- urlLink BartD  is finally playing with his band in April. ---Peeks at XX's cute  urlLink buns  when he's asleep.   Ok, that's 7, but despite the general funk and Monday-osity of today, I am brimming with glee!
