I got all excited the other day when it said I was down to 218.  Then I get on the damn thing now and it says 222.  I did not gain 4 pounds in 36 hours.  So I step off the thing and wait.  I press in the button again and step on.  This time I look down.  It says 217.  Ok cool, that's more like it.  I step off, and press the button again.  I get back on it and look down, and it says 221.  WTF?!?!?!  I get off and wait a moment or two.    I press the button and stand back on it.  This time though, I slide my feet a little more out toward the edges than in the center.  Wow, 215!  So *that's* how I'm supposed to get on the scale?    Maybe next time I should just put one foot on?
