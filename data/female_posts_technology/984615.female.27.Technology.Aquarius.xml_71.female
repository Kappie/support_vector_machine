Although much more fun because now there is evidence of your stupidity. HA.  I am happy - and this is terribly rare...its meant to explain the absence of posts...When I'm happy I tend to get wrapped up in it. and that is not necessarily such a bad thing - it just means that my life becomes mundane in the meantime.   that and this is really just a segway before I get rip-roaring drunk tonight...  yay for international cronies who love to drink as much as I.
