While there was some of that, it was really pretty motivating.  We talked with several folks [including Jason, Luann, Kevin, and Richard] who have done the ride before and have really great testimonials about it.  I'm genuinely psyched about the whole thing.  Apparently, there is actually a Saint Arnold person at the finish line in La Grange (the overnight stop) to direct Saint Arnold-ers to the team tent and they even give us a beer for the last half-mile of our journey to said tent.  Now THAT is why I joined a brewery team!       Once we do this, I am definitely going to have more posts here about it.  One of the things that I wish I'd had access to when first starting was some real advice for "Freddies," or Beginners.  Hopefully if this helps anyone, it is to give some real feedback to new riders about what to do and not do.   So, after rounding out our training this next two weeks and getting everything ready, we've got it all taken care of.  Of course, I still need to raise some money.
