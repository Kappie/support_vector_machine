But, I hope we will pull through. I have apparently had this for 9 years but I didn't think that it was "something". Even though I have had this awhile and there is really nothing new..it has gotten worse over the years. I am paranoid of normal things. The restroom happens to be one of them. I am afraid to shower and use the toilet because I think someone is watching me. Of course I do shower everyday but it isterrorizing to me. I "fight" the terror and just do it anyway. Just go on and live anyway. Don't let anything stop ME from living. It's hard but then there are good days. I forget things for small periods at a time. It feels really scary to me to be the only person who really knows what is not a normal thing forme and see it happening every day.  I looked at the doctor who knew what medicine to give me because he has this skill and knowledge for it, and I wanted him to tell me how this happened. But, I was afraid to ask. HAHAHA
