You wept where my path crossed yours, And I, ignorant in the delight of joy in punishment, I kept silent. Did not. Could not  Fathom why.  You wept where my eyes gazed, And I, ignorant in the facade of pretense in joy, I kept silent. Did not. Could not. Fathom why.  You wept where my words reached your ears, And I, ignorant in the excitement of thrill in the future, I kept silent. Did not. Could not. Fathom why.  You wept, and I doubled up in gaiety. For while you saw me, I saw you. I saw you.  You see? I kept silent Because you could not. I kept silent  Because you would not. I kept silent. Because you did not fathom why.
