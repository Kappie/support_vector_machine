It is my way of eating. I cant remember if I mentioned it before but a few days ago I bought a really large drinking mug. It holds like half a gallon. I really love it. Ice stays in it all day. Im still not drinking as much as I hoped but I am drinking much more than I was.   I have been working outside and enjoying it. Today I plan on starting on the wood.
