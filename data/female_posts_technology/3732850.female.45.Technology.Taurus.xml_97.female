Throughout the essay, she describes how she has lost her privacy, independence and her freedom. She describes how one mundane day leads into another without any variation. Because one day is just like the next, it is difficult for her to know what day of the week it is. She talks about the residents with Alzheimer's who are not aware of where they are. I wonder if she isn't a little envious that they are not aware of their fate.   The author talks about the fact that even the employees don't stay long because it is not a desirable place to work.She states, "This is not the best job to have." They can move on to a better place of employment but she cannot.   My heart goes out to the author. Because people are living longer these days, they are often times unable to take care of themselves as they get older. Family structure is different today with both parents working and leading busy lives. The elderly can depend on their families to take care of them. They are forced to go to some kind of care facility to live out their days. They loose everything they have worked so hard for, even their privacy. I don't know what the answer is, I only know that my heart breaks every time I must go visit someone in the nursing home.
