It was still VR but now it showed the folders on the computer as file cabinets or drawers filled with files that showed up as papers or pictures.  Programs were actually entities such as a sweeper showed in VR as a broom or a cleaner showed up as a mop and bucket.  The Recycle bin or trash on the old computer now shows up as an actual garbage can filled with all the deleted items of the system.  She smiled.  Technology has certainly improved over the years.  It's about time.    She looked closely at his system.  She couldn't see any known holes or cracks in the wall.  Hmm, he is getting better.  A challenge.  She moved slowly closer to the wall.  Being very careful not to trigger any security systems.  It looks like he fixed the hole she found the last time they played the game.  She, of course, knew another way in.  She never played all her cards at once.  Looking closely around to make sure the surveillance was looking in the other direction.  She flew quickly to the right side of the wall.  There.  A key hole.  She grabbed a key from her pocket.  She gave a twist and a door opened.  She moved quickly inside and shut the door.   She shook her head over the flamboyant use of colors and elegance.  What a waste to use technology such as this.    She looked closer at the code that showed up in the walls inside.  The code didn't match the architecture of Brett's system.  She walked down the hallway.  She entered the first office on the right.  Opening up a file cabinet, she glanced at the folders inside.  A name caught her attention.  Genesis Project.  She opened the folder and skimmed the contents.  She felt someone coming through the system.  Quickly she downloaded the information onto her system.  She ducked through the door and back the way she came.  Quickly she opened the backdoor and left the system.      All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003
