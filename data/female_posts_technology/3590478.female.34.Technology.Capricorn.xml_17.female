I got to spend four hours in the Salt Lake City airport on Thursday evening because I missed my original connecting flight. So, I thought that would be the perfect opportunity to be accosted by Mormons. After all, who needs saving more than I do? I was sorely disappointed. Not a single Mormon tried to change my evil ways! I was sucking down caffeine, beer and cigarettes at the speed of light and sporting a band-aid the size of a candy bar above my eye. Surely a sign of some disturbing domestic abuse or sordid life style, right? (The reality is lame. Apparently relatives of Delta employees are not allowed visible piercings in odd places. But the Mormons couldn't possibly know that.) And then there was my extra fine outfit, like one big, giant sign screaming "I'm on the highway to hell."   I guess they don't have any geriatric Mormon recruiters because if they did I'd be telling a very different tale now.    I also expected to hear the Osmonds blaring at top volume out of the speakers but the closest I got was Supertramp muzak. I learned later the beer in Utah is only 3% alcohol by volume or some such lameness. That would explain why it took 6 pints on an empty stomach to reach cruising altitude. I figured I could purchase obscure Orson Scott Card books too but out of 4 books stores all they had was speaker for the dead. Bollix to the bloody Mormons! You think they'd be pushing him harder than the golden tablets of god. Or whatever.  Oh yes, and the duty free shop? A travesty to international flights everywhere.
