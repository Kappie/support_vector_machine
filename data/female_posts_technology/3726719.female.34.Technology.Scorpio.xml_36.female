Phone numbers and my schedule were accessible and the little press of a button.  However the recovery was short lived.  It bleeped it's last ounce of life last week.  Stupid thing wouldn't charge anymore!!  :o)  So I bit the bullet and ordered a replacement.  Not the sleek, high speed, high memory, multi-function one I really really would like to have.  Just a good sturdy, gray-scale, enough memory to do what I need it to do.  Ordered a case for it too so jostling, dropping, and purse traveling will be less harmful.  Waiting is the hardest part......Overstock didn't even ship it until the 12th!!  Sigh.....so here I am....no palm pilot....hoping I don't lose all the schedule and phone number notes I'm carrying around with me......
