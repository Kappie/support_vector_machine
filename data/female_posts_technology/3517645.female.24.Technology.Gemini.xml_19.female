Got to see some of my cousins that I haven't seen in awhile and just hung out. On Saturday night we went out to the bars with two of my cousins, my uncle, and sister. It was a fun night, we all got caught up on what we are doing. We, duane and I, also ran into some friends of ours from high school when we were on our way home.  On Sunday duane called in sick cause he wanted to spend the day with his mom. We took her shopping and she bought the kids there school clothes and sneakers, that was a great help, now I dont have the expensive of that but only there school supplies.  Speaking of school supplies it is insane the stuff that the teachers ask for us to buy for them for school, it basically gets right down to the color and brand of the books, pencils, markers, and everything else. Also the number of items they need is crazy.  I have been told by other parents that it is because they give the supplies to other students in the class they may have purchased the incorrect supplies or wrong brand. So I started only sending one of each set. like one set of markers and one set of pencil crayons, then when they need more I can give them to them to take.  Duane and I both had Tuesday off, so we took the kids out for some brunch and then to the Mactaque beach. It was a fun day. We took them to see spiderman 2 in the evening. They loved it. It was a really great movie, excellent all around.  Well back to work for another 2 days, gives me some time to study for my next exam. oh so fun.
