I cant figure out what else may be wrong.  I want my husband to want me.  In the last month he has stayed up more than laying down with me.  I know his back is hurt and I know I was on my period.  But I truely feel as if he isnt interested in me.  Damn it my heart hurts.  But I will do what ever I can to make him want me again.
