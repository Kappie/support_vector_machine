Its the feel of your mans touch, its the warmth you feel from his breath as you sleep snuzzled up. Its the look in his eyes (you know the look I am talking about) its the sound of his laugh, and the way he makes you laugh. Its the drumming of his heart that you can hear through his chest. Its the way my baby makes me feel.  One day, he will realize what he means to me. The times that I tell him I love him more than life, is true, he will see that one day.   Baby I love you! This has been the loneliest week of my life, but thats not a bad thing, I just miss you when our hours clash like they did this week and it makes me even realize, how much and how deep my love goes for you.  I am truely yours ....heart...mind and soul!
