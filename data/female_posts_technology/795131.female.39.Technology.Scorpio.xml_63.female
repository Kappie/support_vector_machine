Assemblyman Feliz Ortiz says the hotline would connect to the State Department of Motor Vehicles. The caller would report the time, date, location and license plate number of the car being driven by the talker. Think about this for more than two seconds and it becomes obvious that this plan is flawed. The only people who are going see a person using a cell phone while driving would be other drivers. And how are those other drivers going to call the hotline unless they use their own cell phones while driving?
