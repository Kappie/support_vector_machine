He made a lot of U-turns and sped through yellow lights while I marvelled at the majestic and chimerical Victorians. My sole life plan is to eventually live in a Queen Anne victorian in Alameda and drive a Lincoln Continental or an old-timey Caddy. I told XX that I like the Queen Anne's whimsical pointed turret and he mused that it would make a great writing nook. I scoffed at his idea and said there could be a nook only if there's space left under the awesome candelabra. In my future house I plan to have a weather vane, wooden owls, and a ghost. But only if it's friendly and likes to conserve energy by turning off the lights AFTER I'm already asleep. And no howling.   I don't know how, but after crisscrossing the city a couple times and circling around its perimeter, we arrived at the bar. We had a few drinks, a couple piroshkis, then headed to the Alameda Auction House, a second-run movie theater, to watch "Rififi." I have two current cine short-term goals: one is to watch the entire oeuvre of Tim Burton and identify style and recurrent themes, and the second is to familiarize myself with the French New Wave. Rififi was good, but I dozed off for a bit because of the lethal combo of fatigue + 1 beer. The really riveting part about the movie is a long segment when there is no talking and no music, only gangsters working quickly and in complete total silence. The understimulus is compelling.    Saturday  I watched cooking shows on PBS and made two pots of chicken stock. Then I walked down to Clement St. and bought lots of dim sum for myself at the bakery. Each time I go, I like to try something new. There is this one odd dim sum item that is my current fave:  sweet bread laced with creamy mayonnaise and topped with wispy dried pork and bits of green onions. I don't know the name, but its description made XX blanch and confirmed my status as a thrill-seeking fatass.   At night we went to the Chinese New Year Parade at Union Square. XX brought his Super 8 camera to capture some footage for a future film, but we couldn't get a good spot. It was crowded and in the thinnest sections, 4 people deep. He held the camera above his head and hoped for the best. The parade was spectacular. There were gilded monkeys, long jewel-toned chinese dragons slinking along in S-shapes, noisy smoky firecrackers, lovely beauty queens, male cheerleaders, the KTVU news team, marching bands, and marching kids.  One elementary school had little kids dressed up as Italian tables with red checkered tablecloths, some walking pizza slices, and a little chef with a big poufy hat. I got a little choked up because it was so silly and wonderful and cute. Later on in the parade, there were little kids dressed up as firecrackers, puttering around, and having to turn their entire firecracker bodies if they wanted to look to the side or talk to their firecracker friends. XX leaned down and said in genuine honesty that he gets a little misty too, but not when he sees people dressed like pizza or explosives, but when he sees retarded kids. I was like, "What?" and he just shrugged, eyes starting to glisten. I was like, "I don't see no retarded kids! Where are they? Where are you looking?!" and he ignored me, thinking about some other time, some other parade that had retarded kids.    Sunday  I went to brunch sans Abby (boohoo), Urban Outfitters, and a surprise birthday party. XX went to the party with me and afterwards we ordered Chinese food and hung out at my house. He hasn't travelled much lately because of my petulance and whining, but is on the road again this week and frankly, I'm relieved. After hanging out allthetime with him, I'm crabby. I used to think it was cute when he'd fall on his rump, or trip, or drop things, or spill things, but now, it's grating my nerves. And like the bitch I can be, I let him know.   Yesterday night, he knocked over the fried rice container and spilled food across the table. I pointed out that he is clumsy. Later on that night, he spilled some beer on himself and so, I point out that he is klutzy. Post-coitus, I ask him to reach over and get me a napkin, so he rolls over and in slow motion his arms flail, his legs kick up, he reaches out for something, anything, to save himself... he grabs my metal, hot, free-standing radiator... he lands with a crash on the clown tray that I keep by my bed... the pitcher of water on it tumbles off and spills... I am not amused, but all I hear is his loud raucous laughter from the floor. He gets up and is embarrassed but chuckling. He has ruined the mood. I do not feel like cuddling or coming. I want him to leave.   He puts his clothes back on and in putting on his jacket, all the contents of his pockets manage to free themselves and tumble to the floor... cigarettes, keys... he looks up and shushes me before I sigh or scream. We say goodbye, and when the door shuts, the air is still and calm. I sleep soundly. In the morning, I wake up and turn on the light. On the floor, in pieces, is the ceramic dish that I made in high school -- the only piece from my ceramics class that was worth keeping...  But it's unimportant. When I was in high school I used to think how unfair it was that we couldn't take our possessions with us when we die. Our collections we worked so hard to amass become divided again. Our clothes and things we treasured and valued get sold or given away.... My thinking has changed since then. What I once considered an injustice is now a blessing because in the end, the material becomes immaterial. We leave our bodies behind and go someplace else. And when that journey begins, who the heck wants to pack?   But on a second note, I am XX-proofing my room. Before he comes back, I'm going to wrap everything in bubble wrap and marshmallows. Though the price of sex may be shattered pottery, I like to bargain, and I'm gonna try very hard to get my lovin pro boner, I mean, bono.
