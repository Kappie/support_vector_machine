She has an annoying phony personality, but she's starting to grow on me. Anyway, the trick I learned from her is white wine marinade. A little Muscat wine, some honey, some orange rind, some juice, and voila, it's like a bowl of sangria-flavored fruit. Went to my brother's BBQ for his gf's bday and ate 1 cheeseburger, 1/2 a polish sausage, and 1 hamburger patty. And mac n cheese and fruit salad. Then the whole lot of us went to see  urlLink Saved!  at the Metreon. That movie was great. I'm a new fan of Jena Malone. She will save us all.  Then Green Marble and I went home and fragranced the apartment with parfums d'posterieur... then there was a trumpeting contest... Ok, I'll stop now.
