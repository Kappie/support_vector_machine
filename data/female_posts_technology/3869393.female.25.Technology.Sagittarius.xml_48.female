Everytime, it used to be picturized as this feeling which was unmatchable, and something which could never die from your life!  I used to wonder, hey, its' just a person who comes into your life and then moves away, and you then move to the next person...so whats the big fuss all about?   But then, a few days ago, I began to take a different angle to this ideology and decided to do a little research on why it is said that " true love is the purest form of love, and why one cant ever get over it for life! "  First and foremost, when does a person fall in love the first time?  Well, one can hardly say, coz true love is quite different from a crush or an infactuation, it's this feeling of weightlessness which overtakes a person and makes them feel that the entire world in which they exist is too perfect, when in reality, they know quite well that it's far from being called perfect!  When one falls in love for the first time, the emotions which conquer the heart and mind are quite unimaginable really, everything feels amazing, there is a complete halo aroud the person and things feel absolutely perfectly warm and  romantic!  When does this happen to people, well, can happen at the age of 10, 50 or even 80...one never knows when they'll find that first person for whom they will have such overwhelming feelings for....it just happens one fine day!  Everyone remembers their first love. Few experiences will ever be as intense and overwhelming as your first crush.When teenagers develop a sense of extraordinary closeness with another person, the experience has echoes of the close contact between mother and child in infancy. Falling in love as a teenager is more intense than the experience in adulthood. But these early relationships usually burn out quickly!   Falling in love for the first time is like taking your first go at cocane!  As funny as it sounds, the effects are very much the same, a heady mix of emotional and physical passion with your partner.  So how does one know that they are going thro' the process of falling in love for the first time?  Researchers have identified three phases of love. The initial physical response is 'lust'. The falling in love is called 'attraction'. The emotional commitment, required to make relationships last in the long term, is known as 'attachment'.  The first cuddle, the first kiss, first hug, first date and many firsts will always linger in your mind with all other special memories of your life!   So why is it so tough for people to get over something as your first love? Isnt it just an experience like another?  Its' not as though we dont fall in love and out of it again?   Well...the answer is quite simple, like all special things, its the first experience, the first of the addictions in your life...the first step towards maturing...the first step towards adulthood!  Can one ever forget their first love?  No way, its a part of your history, your life on this planet!  For any amount of pain which might have gone with this experience, its an experience worth cherishing for a life time...the first time you fall head over heals for a person and that person reciprocates the same feelings towards you!  Love is an addiction, you cant kick this habit without finding another addiction to get addicted to!
