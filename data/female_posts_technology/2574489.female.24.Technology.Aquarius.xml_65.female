First of all, we got snow in Texas!  This is the first snowfall of the winter season and having hubby wake me up and pull up the blinds to reveal drops of snow and a white covered scene outside the window was a good way to wake up on Valentine's day.  Unlike those that live in colder parts of the world, snow is still a novelty for us.  We thought we wouldn't be able to go anywhere because the roads would ice up but the weather cooperated and we were able to trek to Carraba's Italian Grill and beat the crowd.  No waiting, unlike the  poor folks who came in about an hour after we came in.  I didn't order the right thing--too much pasta.  But I had a peach Bellini and the atmosphere was romantic as hell.  I looked at the couples around us and I imagined we were the happiest couple there...corny, I know.  After that, we went to the mall.  I have been feeling selfish lately because it always seems to be about me.  My shoes that we buy, my purse, my flowers so I tried to get Woody to buy a pair of brown boots that he's been wanting.  But he took a look at the prices and just couldn't bring himself to be impractical for once (sigh).  I bought myself a pair of dark blue jeans from the Gap (used $$ gift that I got).  I love it.  The style is called Long and Lean.  Before purchasing, they told us they had a deal of buy $75 and get $15 off.  So hubby picked out a sweater and a pair of pants as well.    And Sunday was good too.  I got my eyebrows done (finally!). We met up with my family at Galleria mall.  Visited a lot of stores.  I bought a belt from Gap and hope I've heard the last of hubby saying I need a belt (he thinks wide belts are sexy...go figure).  We had dinner at Tokyo One.  I had Teppanyaki, crab legs with butter and lime, chicken teriyaki, shrimp fried rice, creme brulee for dessert....the best part: towards the end of the meal after coming back from the bathroom, our server brought out a cake with a candle and a chocolate-dipped strawberry on top and my whole family sang me Happy B-Day.  I have the best family.  And I have the best brother:  Rhy, thanks for the paper-shredder! It's weird but I have always wanted this.  I now feel safer about my private information when I put it in the trash.
