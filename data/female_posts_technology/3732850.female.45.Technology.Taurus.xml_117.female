I get the impression that she really doesn't like her position in the family. Obviously she has some pride in what (or rather, how many things) she does, but she doesn't seem to get much appreciation. In a way she is presenting her own life through her husband's eyes and I have a feeling all is not well in paradise. This essay is probably well received by many wives. I am not a wife myself (hallelujah, a shaft of light and angelic voices), but I liked it. I get mad at myself when I take my mother for granted and just basically anyone in my life. And it's so doggon easy to do.  Many wives probably feel this way. Problem after problem arises and they are expected to handle it because the man has been "working all day." It's a pity that this author felt so frustrated that she had to write something like this. It's a pity she felt she needed a wife. It's a pity she felt unappreciated and harried. I'm sure Brady voiced what many women wish to voice. But I wonder, how many men are feeling this way, too? The grass is always greener.........
