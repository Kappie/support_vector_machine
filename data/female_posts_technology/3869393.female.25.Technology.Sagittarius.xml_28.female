Yet again, I had problems posting stuff on someone's comments page, I thought okay, anyway I need to update my blog, so why not address certain issues in this ....  1. Temple visiting bringing peace: anything with god for a truly religious person, will bring peace to one's heart to a good extent. But there is a saying that God helps only those who help themselves. One needs to truly believe in their heart and mind, that they can find peace, only then will they ever get close to that.  2. Trying to mend fences : well, this is something which I can do if I had a reason to do so, but right now I see no rhyme or reasoning coming from the other side of the fence to mend this. Anyway, as said by someone some time ago, certain lessons learnt can cause a lot of pain and grief to people, and trying to implement the changes will only make others experience more pain and misery. This is somethign which I dont think certain people are upto to facing up to!  3. Moving on in life : Its' just a process, one needs to try to take an initiative towards moving on in life, you cant wait for life to thrust something onto you to make your life. Unlike someone, I aint got people hounding them with horoscopes, photos of puny  cute women, ads, trips, training, etc, all I have is my work, workout at the club, trips out of chennai and my music. I am trying to find solace in this and am quite aware that this is going to be long process, but I need to make an effort towards this, coz I cant run away from this!  4. Memories : For someone who has been in love, that too true love, its far too tough and also not exactly humanly possible to forget these good memories. If one is able to forget these memories, it only shows the commitment they had to the relationship.   Today, after nearly 7 years, I went back to the swimming pool, was shit scared to get in, and felt oh my, I might just drown if I get into the deep end. This was the thought which was ringing in my head from my office to before changing at swimming pool dressing room. As I was changing, I began to wonder, hmm, I have swam before, learnt the art well enough, yeah I lost touch, so , does that mean I will drown if I set foot in the water...??? I then decided, no more idiotic thoughts in my head, I will get into the deep end and swim across to the shallow end and back. In addition to this fear, I had this fear that, oh my what if I look depressing in my swim suit and people give me the stares. Another stupid thought which just filled my head, which I simply decided to overcome, and yes, I did check things out in the mirror before I got into the pool...geez I wasnt exactly a hippo and more than anything I believed in myself that I was taking steps to drop my weight, and this was good for me, so no use running away from it. Got into the pool, had a shaky start, had a little tough time getting to the other end, but within 10 minutes I was back to normalcy and could feel my body moving like a fish. How did this come, simple, coz I believe that my heart and mind are co operating with me, and also feel that I am doing the right thing, and nothing wrong at all!  Life is about choices, the choices we make may appear to make or break our lives, but usually the choices we turn down find a way of coming back to us later on in life, in a differnt wrapper....its' just the way you see life!   Wear your belief on your shoulder, trust yourself and you'll realise the world has a lot to offer, and there are a zillion people around you wanting to know you more!
