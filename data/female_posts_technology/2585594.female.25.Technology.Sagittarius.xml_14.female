And I wish I could still write nice poems like I did once before. Before I got into this mess that I now call my life. Yes, I have friends. Yes, I have money. And yes, I do as I please. Still, I am not where I once wanted to be.  Was it the lovely fairy that I left when I entered the world of maturity? Was it Santa and his magical Christmas that I left when I stopped believing that people did care? Was it the magnificent unicorn and its healing power that I left when I filled my head with talk of technology, stocks, investments, and garb?  I don’t know exactly when I stopped looking at the sky. I don’t know exactly when I stopped dancing in the rain. I don’t know exactly when I stopped listening to the sounds of the world. I don’t know exactly when I stopped dreaming. I don’t know exactly when I stopped laughing like a child. I don’t know exactly when I stopped. I just remember that life overtook me. And this is what life’s supposed to be. Then death must be such a beautiful thing. A chance to end the silence and renew my commitment to life.
