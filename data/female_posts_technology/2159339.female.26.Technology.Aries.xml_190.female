Ok, so what's new, I'm really tired - was up all night with my cough. Finally decided to chug some Codeine around 3 am, so of course couldn't get up this morning for the life of me. The inhaler Kaiser prescribed is actually for asthma, Kelly told me, so no wonder it's not doing anything for the cough. This morning at the doctor's they said that I should wait another 2 weeks before contacting them about this (the purpose for my appt was my jaw tumor thingie). Yes, I was in the exam room, talking with a medical doctor after having waited for 45 goddamn minutes and they couldn't bust out the stethoscope for 20 seconds. Bastards!   On the bright side, my car got fixed today and it only cost 60 bucks!! I was waiting for Alex (the paternal parent) to help me deal with this situation, but surprise! he stopped talking again last Monday (a la November-December 2003) and since no one knows how long he will be in this peaceful state, I had to take the matters into my own hands with the drive to Coachella coming up in mere days. In addition to taking care of this, drove mom around all weekend - cheese shop, produce market, bread store, meat store, gramma's, lastly SF Center for some retail therapy. She is overly generous when Alex gets weird like this and while at Nordstrom, kept pointing at random things and asking if I want them. I didn't, but I did let her buy me some shoes and a sweater. Also had my kayaking class yesterday and dinner with Alex (friend, not father), Genny, M and some friends from NY.    Tomorrow is the big 26. Want to hide under my bed very badly, but that's not an option since I'm trying to save up my vacation time for the road trip. Jann Workmama is taking me out to a fancy lunch, bless her heart. Then might get some ribs for dinner. I'm foregoing offical party-dom in favor of pigging out all day. All week, actually. Just need for the cough to go away long enough for me to be able to say a sentence.  That's all for now.
