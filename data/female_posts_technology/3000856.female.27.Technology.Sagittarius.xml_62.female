She said she felt so comfortable and definitely wanted to come back. Also find out she is getting a bike too so I will have another girl to ride with. VERY COOL! I have come to the realization that something that could have been really good is coming to an end. What am I gonna do about it? Keep moving forward baby! I will be alright I always am. Anyway gotta get a move on talk more laterz!
