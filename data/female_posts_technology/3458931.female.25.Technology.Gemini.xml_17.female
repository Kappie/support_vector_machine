For those living in the Fredericton area, the city is showing classic movies every Sunday at 9PM on an outdoor screen near the officers' barracks/library.   On Sunday D and I saw "The Italian Job", 1969 version. It was pretty funny, and I loved the little cars they used in the chase scene. There was also a short independant film from a local film maker that was pretty amusing; "Tie Your Laces".  A word of advice to those who venture out: dress very warmly and bring blankets. I could have made use of some mittens as well.
