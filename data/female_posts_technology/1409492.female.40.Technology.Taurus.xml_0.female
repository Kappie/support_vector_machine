I have 3 full weeks invested in this diet and haven't lost as much as I wished. Actually I'm just being impatient. The facts are: 1) my clothes fit looser, 2)I am not fatiguing (is that a word?) out at the gym, and 3) I am losing.  The gym part makes me happy. I quit trying to kill myself on the cardio. I now am running at a pace that gets me going pretty good, but I don't stumble around the weights like I did the first week. During this last week it seems my lifting is at the level where I left off before vacation.
