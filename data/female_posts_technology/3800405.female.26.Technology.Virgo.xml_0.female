They take a bunch of women, women who have been screened down to the biggest prima donnas who can't last outside a city with high-end salons and hotels, and drop them out of a plane into the Australian Outback to compete for an Australian guy named Jack.   Seriously, that's the premise of the show.  The saddest part is: I'm hooked.  I missed the first episode, but having gotten through 3/4 of the second show I find myself looking forward to the next episode. In my own defense, I enjoyed the stuff about what the Outback is really like. OK, I like the petty fighting among the women too, and checking out Jack. For one thing, he's pretty cute.  ...and his accent rocks!  Is this really what we've sunk to - watching other people's love lives played out in a completely unrealistic setting?
