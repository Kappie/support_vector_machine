Some of you know that one, others, well, good thing there wasn't a video camera in the cab because ... My potential political career would be ruined (wink wink) . Anyways went to a local bar thurday night. My intention was to go their get 2 beers then go meet a friend. That planned was quickly ruined by 4 chicks whom kept buying my shots of some brown drink, it wasn't Yeager but it tasted just as bad. Now I should have known it was a set up because they weren't really drinking, kept giving me their drinks. Long story short I almost got taken advantage of by 4 chick so I had to brake out of their and go home. The weridest things we do when we are drunk. I stumbled in the door and began to clean my house in the wee hours of the morning. I was vacuuming and sweeping and throwing out trash till I passed out in the middle of my living room with a dust rag in my hand. Hmmm well maybe not as interesting pf a drunken story as I use to have. No fights, sex, running people over ...etc. I GUESS I AM REALLY GETTING OLD HUH?
