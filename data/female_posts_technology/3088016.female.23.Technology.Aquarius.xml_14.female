They are small, slow-moving primates, and very cute.  One of the party guests later sent out a  urlLink fact sheet  she had found on the internet about the animals.  Wayne forwarded it to me.  I promised to stop asking for a puppy if he would get me one, paying no regard to the poisonous spit or the toxins in their forearms.    I have had interest in various other exotic pets before.  For a while I wanted a  urlLink Sugar Glider , but I was easily talked out of it when I read about how high-maintenance they are.   urlLink Fennec Foxes  also seemed cute, and many people keep them just like they would a small dog, but when I found that some of them do not house train very well, I gave up on that one, too.    I think what it really comes down to is not that I want to own any of these animals; I just want to play with them for a while and give them back to their owners, sort of like kids.  Maybe what I really need is just a trip to the Houston Zoo.
