I never really had a Christmas when I lived with my dad and all he could afford was two presents each for my brother and me. That year that I moved in with my mom, I had the biggest Christmas ever. It was so huge that when I wake up I honsety thought I woke up in a different home. That Christmas tree was very much so pregnant that I went back to bed and went to sleep and thought this time I will wake up and this time I will be in the right house. To my suprise, I was in the right house that tree didn't change at all!  I was working at McDonald's at the time so I had some money to buy presents for my family, that was great. I love to shop for people I have no problems getting them things. I think that is why Christmas is my favorite holiday, because I can buy presents for people and I can make them happy. I like Christmas now, that I have kids it great to see their smile and excitment on Christmas morning.
