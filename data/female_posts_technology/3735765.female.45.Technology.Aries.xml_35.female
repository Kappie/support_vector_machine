Was he trying to say that I am a Nerd??? Hmmm... I am not sure that I would "resemble" that remark; however, come to think of it....    I started in 1984 working for Michael Dell when he was operating as PC's Limited, and nearly every job that I have been involved with has involved a great deal of software applications and teaching others computer usage in some form or fashion. I have a logical mind that feels challenged by some critical thinking processes. But, does that make me a techie???? hmmm...    I also have a creative side of me that is often challenged by the endless possibilities that can occur within any particular software program, but needs far more than what the computer/technological world can supply me for resources of creative media.    Additionally, I probably am the only girl that can attest to helping her Dad with putting together Heathkit TVs, etc (back in the day), having a Lionel train set up on a large plywood board table, a playable victrola, a library full of books on two walls of the room, a handmade radio and turntable made with visible vaccum tubes, and extra stored gidgets and gadgets that could not be placed in anyother part of the house but my very own bedroom!! :) Perhaps, I was destined to be a Geek, Nerd, Techie -- or, whatever the label is these days by mere osmosis of being around my Dad???? Who knows.    However, if being one of these labels, means also that I can master some critical level thinking skills, then I guess I am fitting the bill to the -T. In this day and age, it would be unrealistic to say that technology never affects oureveryday existance and means for living; in fact, it is quite clearly the opposite that is true. I yearn to see what might be coming about in the future of our world. I have seen technology advance by leaps and bounds. I am so excited to be a part of the growth and expansion process by providing technical assistance to callers calling into the center regarding an assundry of issues. Why, in just the last 25 years, there has been an incredible advancement made in technology; I am soexcited to see what the next 25 years will bring that I am quite literally sitting on the edge of my seat!! Technological advancements are only limited by our own imaginations. Just imagine where we will be!! :)
