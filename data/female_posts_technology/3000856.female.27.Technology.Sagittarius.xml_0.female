LOL Sat went to go see Mike and the boys play w/ some AC DC cover band that totally sucked! Really thinking about this job thing.  Wondering if it will interfere w/ the band.  God, I hope not.  It shouldn't I was told I will only work Mon-Fri but may work an occasional Sat. Why can't anything come easy to me? That would be asking too much. Sent my resume to Loyola, so maybe I will hear something from that. I guess all I can do is wait and see.
