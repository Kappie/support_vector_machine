Losing to St. Louis sucked.  Making the playoffs anyway doesn't.   Explaining to my mother why it's not unusual for her to find me at E at 8:15 PM wearing sunglasses at the bar is futile.  Having her return an hour and a half later to find me in the same state proves it.   Working on Sunday sucks.   Getting a free pass to skip out on the most convoluted family Easter dinner was just too easy.
