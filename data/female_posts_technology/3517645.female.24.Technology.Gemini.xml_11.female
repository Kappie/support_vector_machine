I grew up in a family where you kept everything inside. Even when my father was killed, my mother and I didn't even share a hug. I look back now after 6 years and realize how strange that was. Now that I have kids, I make sure they know that I love them and share hugs and kiss every day to show that I care. I don't want them to grow up in a house like I did, cold and quiet.   Ah the kids. How great are they, 6 and 5 next week. They keep me on my toes and keep me smiling everyday. It is his birthday next week going to have a party with some of his friends.   Well work is calling again. Until next time
