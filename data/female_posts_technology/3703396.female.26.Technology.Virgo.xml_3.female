I had gone to the pool store earlier for lunch, and picked up some goggles, a snorkeling kit, nose plugs, ear plugs, a kickboard, a ball, a thermometer and a new bikini.  Woohoo!  For the first time ever, I was able to snorkel.  Ok, well, I call it snorkel!  I know it's just cheap plastic and 2 feet of water, but it was really cool!  Just as we were laughing and taking underwater pictures and learning to breath under water, a HUGE DUST STORM came flying into Gilbert.  It came very quick, and the massive cloud was upon us within about 2 minutes of seeing the first sign of the sweeping cloud masses of dust.  It was like a scene out of Twister.  Andrew looked up behind me and said, "We have to cover the pool, now!"  I turned and saw what he did and yes... oh yes.. must cover pool now!  We barely made it out in time to cover the pool, put down the patio umbrella, flatten all the chairs, and bring in all the towels and the stereo before the storm hit.  The wind knocked down our unicorn winder (like a wind chime thing) and continued to break our patio umbrella moreso than it is already broken.   I was so depressed at having to get out of the pool... I felt like I was 5 years old and somebody told me Christmas was cancelled.  All I wanted to do was snorkel!  Ahh well.  Maybe tomorrow night we can try again.
