I don't mean to sound like a bitch, but this is not my problem.  I am not taking down my achives again and they can threaten me all they want, anyone that knows me also knows I don't scare easily! Worked w/ Jake last night.  He may be filling in for our 22 show.  I hope so anyway.  This is all so fucked up right now! I have a ton of stuff to do this weekend and I am on call.  YIPPEEE! Can you hear the enthusiasm? Jeremy is throwing the sox in my face right now and I am about to beat him. LOL Sean called today and is being very nice.  Something is up and I am scared.  He is actually picking up Collen from school tomorrow to spend some time w/ him.  WOW! What else? Hmmmm Oh yeah did I mention my life sucks! Still job searching, no luck.  Like I have said before, if I didn't have bad luck I would not have any! :-p
