Although one colleague pointed out that it was being held by a man who could be seven foot tall.  It's a World Cup, it should be bigger. You'd need another five to make a decent set.  Saturday night again, and am waiting for the front page of this esteemed Sunday publication to arrive on my desk, so it can signal the end of another working week for me.  Damn the delays brought on by sports carnivals.    I attempted some Christmas shopping this week, to no avail.  I did buy some things for myself though, although I resisted buying yet another denim skirt, I feel that having four is enough.    It's been a weird week, people stressing around me all over the place, colleagues crying from the stress and having violent dreams. Others confessing all sorts of personal life issues, it's been strange and revealing and fascinating,  I live for that stuff, the humanity, that is, not the suffering. Although some could argue that they are one and the same thing.  It's that time of the year, I guess. It kind of begins around September I think, all the pressure of having to deal with the 'end of the year' I think. People get reflective and think  'what have I done?'.  When really, it's just passed all in a blur of work, sleep, eat, reality television - well, for me it has.  How do you find meaning in between that stuff? I guess it's in the small moments.
