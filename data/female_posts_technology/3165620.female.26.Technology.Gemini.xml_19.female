I found out that  urlLink http://www.tourhendrickscounty.com  organization has a list of wedding/banquet facilities that are available within Hendricks County.  They can also help with out-of-town hotel guests by informing the hotels of when/howMany/howLong and the hotels will submit their best offers for rooms.  Contact Jeff Brown 317-718-8750,  urlLink mailto:jeff@tourhendrickscounty.com  for more information.  Jeff talked briefly about several possibilites, golf course clubhouses, etc and seems to have a lot of the contacts you might want to check out.  He has the schedules in some cases.  Here's the things I found out by calling around - most things are already booked.  McCloud Nature Park is open if you want something less formal.    urlLink http://www.tourhendrickscounty.com  - McCloud (Nature) Park, Available Aug 28, 'Hanger' -$250 all day, Gazebo $100 All Day.
