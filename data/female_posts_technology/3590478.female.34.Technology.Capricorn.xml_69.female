I don’t always have to bother putting stuff in a neat little story or list form. The two people who actually look at this without being coaxed to do so with a cattle prod won’t care. (Which has ceased by the way. The prodding I mean. How hard is it to stop playing Texas poker or free cell for 5 seconds and go check for an update? You know you’ll be disgusted and offended on some level. Gosh, maybe you could, oh I don’t know, bookmark the link? Crazy talk I’m sure.) Right then, off I go. I saw the Village (Settle down, I’m not giving any secrets away) and I’m torn between screaming, “go see it now, hurry up damn you!” so I’ll have someone other than Rhoda* to discuss it with (Rhoda being my partner in crime at the viewing. And *=Rhoda is an alias.) Or screaming, “Don’t see it! Let me tell you and save you from pissing $8.50 away!”  I can make these comments without revealing anything: 1) It’s shot beautifully. 2) Ron Howards’ daughter is in it and thankfully the child received her mothers’ genes in the looks department. 3) Sigourney Weaver was speaking kind of weird. Sort of like her character from working girl crossed with Erica Kane on one of her “trying to distract from the actual topic” rants.   Speaking of Erica Kane, I framed a poster of her recently and hung it over the bar and it makes me cackle with maniacal glee every time I look at it. Erica, in all her 1988 glory, next to a list of all the “men she’s loved”. (I swear to god it says that! The list is 15 years old and it’s still massive.) The poster is advertising 2 very special episodes from February of that year (must’ve been sweeps).  Easily amused I am.  I spent Saturday night catching up on replay TV cheesy goodness and getting toasted. My social life is to be admired and coveted. You’re all just jealous.    I saw another movie last week called without a paddle. No fear of giving any plot secrets away on this one as there was no plot worth speaking of.  Why would I go see a dreadful teen movie you ask? Well, not because Seth Green was in it but because Seth Green was  at the theater . You should have seen the pile of crap with his picture on it that I had in my purse in hopes of getting him to sign it. (Rhoda was with me so I was planning on involving her in my stalking plans. She didn’t know that part.) Alas it didn’t work out but I did get shoved into him. What an adorable young man he is!   Here’s a tip for you: Don’t wear shorts while you’re slinging a weed eater. I know this but continue to ignore it because it’s Africa hot. So now I have all these owies all over me where chunks of glass, asphalt etc. were slung against my flesh at top weed eater slinging force. No bruises mind you (I hardly ever get bruised-must be that hardy cattle stock I hail from) I might could get sympathy if I had a bruise to back the whining up, but the weed eater is a professional model and extra heavy so, bonus, bulgy arm muscles.    Can you tell from my frenzied delivery that I’m back to lovable monkey sidekick mode? Whew! I’m sure you’re relieved. I know I am. Lovable monkey sidekicks should not be depressed, it detracts from their comedy relief. I believe I’ve discovered the key. Lots of vitamin B and beer.
