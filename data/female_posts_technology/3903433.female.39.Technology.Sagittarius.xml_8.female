I started when I was 7, and several months later entered a NJ state competition and eventually came in 3rd place that first year (you have to go through the preliminaries, semi-finals, and then finals over the course of several months). My sister gave her first concert when she was 4 1/2 years old.  My dad assumed he had two little Mozarts for daughters but it turns out that's not true. It's the method that's important, and what's interesting is that my dad was able to capture the gist of my piano teacher's techniques by watching her operate when we took piano lessons. Coupled with his background as a now retired physicist with a PhD from Cornell, and you have an online tutorial that enables others to do the same thing we did when we were children. One teenager wrote to my dad recently to follow up. He started piano lessons in Dec. 2002 using the techniques outlined in my dad's book. Three months later he entered a concerto competition hosted by his high school, and came in first place. He beat out others who had been taking lessons for 10+ years.
