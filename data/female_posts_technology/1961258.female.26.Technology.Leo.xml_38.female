I do so wish I could be around that weight again, would be wonderful.   Have eaten nothing so far, which is great. But will go down in awhile and have some cereal and fruit. And do a workout .. or maybe I should eat after I have a workout? I think it's better before since I need the energy.  Will update this later and see whether I've stuck to the plan.
