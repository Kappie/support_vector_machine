It is becoming a portrait of who I really am, underneath the tailored business suit and make up and behind the loud outgoing voice.  It represents me more than any resume ever could.   Can you imagine?  A business card with my blog's URL elegantly engraved on it.   Shaking hands. "Nice to meet you". Exhcanging cards (with both hands, and a slight bow of the head).  Then they would sit at their office desk under a flickering fluorescent light and check out my site - expecting the usual captions: Professional Experience, Education, Skills...  and instead finding these... "Semblance of Sanity", "My dark hours" and "Bedroom Invasion".   Would I get a follow-up call the next day?
