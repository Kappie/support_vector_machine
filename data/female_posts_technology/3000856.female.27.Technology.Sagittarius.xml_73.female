I forgot how incredibly good it makes me feel.  Ran 3 miles and did legs and abs today.  I know I will be feeling it big time the next couple of days.  I love the burn! I have decided that I am going to get the people that give me negative vibes out of my life.  I don't need people in my life that upset me, stress me out and make me feel poorly of myself.  If they were good friends they would not have made me feel like that in the first place is what I say.  I have many positive goals that I am now working toward and plan on meeting and surpassing those goals. I will beat my negative feelings and I will beat the feeling of not feeling good enough.
