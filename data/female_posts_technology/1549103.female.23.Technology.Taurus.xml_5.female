It made for a rather heavy piece of mail, but I slapped four stamps on it, wrote on the envelope "photos enclosed, please do not bend" in several places, and called it good.    The letter arrived in his mail box BENT IN HALF.      Now I don't know about you, but I rarely receive folded mail.  My bills, bank statements, etc. arrive in their long business sized envelopes crisp and neat.  Am I to believe that the United States Postal Service has such limited mail handling equipment that a FIVE BY SEVEN (or whatever, it wasn't very big) envelope can't get through unharmed?   Although I believe I'm justified in my righteous anger, I do have to come clean.  I was very polite in my scrawled requests on the outside of the envelope, but I admit that the letter enclosed made reference to "those Post Office fuckers" and how they better not bend these pictures.  But you know, it was a joke.    There are, of course, only three possibilities for what happened:   Someone bent it DELIBERATELY to be MEAN which, I mean, I'm no angel myself but how can people be like that?  Someone opened the envelope as part of the new government policy of total privacy invasion in the name of the greater good, was insulted, and bent the pictures in revenge.  Okay, I should be nice, but what are they doing reading my mail?  Karma for making fun of the USPS.  I guess I would just have to accept that one
