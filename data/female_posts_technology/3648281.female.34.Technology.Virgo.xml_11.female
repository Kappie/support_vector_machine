I know this move is the best thing for him and his family. What I feel is pure selfishness.  Greg called me tonight. He wants to spend some time with me this weekend. He said he would take a look at what is going on in the attic. That's sweet. He took me to a cafe for dinner Tuesday night. It was very charming. He planned the whole thing out. He warms me. It's strange.   Tomorrow my sister is coming!! YIIIIPPPEEE!!! I will make Mexican and watermelon margaritas!! A visit from Debbie ALWAYS cheers me up. It's good to have a sister.  I am making progress with my project. Finally. I can breathe. Archie is coming to pick-up the side project Monday. I will be glad to see that thing gone. If I pick-up anymore side work I need a good kick in the ass.  To bed - plenty to do but need to sleep now...
