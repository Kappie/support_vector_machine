She has this rule where in order to buy 1 thing, she needs to get rid of 3 things.  I think it was 3.  Might have been 5.  I'm going to stick with 3 for now.  So I just got rid of 24 pieces of clothing and 2 stuffed animals.  Now I want to go shopping!  I also decided to transform some old t-shirts.  Every buy or get a t-shirt that you never wear because it's just too big or too boring?  I took out the scissors and went to town.  I'll probably wear my newly tranformed Wallingford Wurst Festival shirt tomorrow. :)
