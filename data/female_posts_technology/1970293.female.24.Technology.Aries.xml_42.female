She didn't know if she could ever trust or even love him the way she did at the beginning.  There just seemed to be so much heartache and pain.  She didn't know if she could go on living like this.  Was it really worth the pain?  She didn't feel that it was.  She did love him, God help her.  But the pain is too much for her to handle anymore.  Could she go on alone without him?  She might just find out soon if she could.  She used to be independent of everyone and anything.  Strange how that changed when she fell in love with him.  it is of no matter though.  She could live on her own if she must.  It shouldn't be that hard.    All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003
