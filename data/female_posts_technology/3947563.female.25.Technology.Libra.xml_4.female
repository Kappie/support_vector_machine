For dinner I had a torilla shell with low fat refried beans, cheese, onions, red peppers, tomatoes and some cajun spices. It was great! I had some low fat popcorn with kernels salt and vinegar spice and some cherry's.   I haven't gotten one workout in yet this week - I know I'm terrible. I could make exuses...but what would they do really;) I'm heading to the gym right now for my lunch break to do some weights.   I have almost no plans this weekend so I'm going to spend time at the gym and cleaning to make up for the lack of phyical excersise this week.   You are all doing really well! Keep it up.
