I appreciate your insight, patience, humor and the way you slid the tissue box over when my eyes were watering up and I looked like I would lose it at any second (which I sometimes did). I appreciate all your help but I think I will take it from here. And I know that just yesterday, at our last appointment ever, you said that my relationship with M borders on abusive (from both sides), and recommended cbt (cognitive behavioral therapy) so that I can reprogram my brain to think healthy happy positive thoughts. It's just that I think I'm finally okay with it. Yes, he talks about threesomes occasionally and I have gotten into the habit of physically restraining his speech by placing my hand over his mouth, but you know, every relationship is different and this works for us. Besides, he's leaving in June and it'll be over and I'll find someone else, maybe just as fucked up yet amusing, to spend my time with. But you should have seen us at the bar last night. His friend with the glasses and the facial hair said he liked me because he had never met a girl who talks so much shit about her boyfriend to his friends. You would've thought it was terribly unhealthy but I had a good time. And you're right about my family. Yes, we almost let my father die of a heart attack rather than forcing him into an ambulance against his will, but that’s just our way. And I've told you a million times that my parents pester me about marriage and career and children, but I never told you that that they’re the most youthful, fun-loving, smartest people I know (and they’re donating whole bunch of vodka for the party).  And yes, my gramma is a catch-22 in so many ways, but she’s the matriarch and I don’t think I’m supposed to agree with her about everything. And when she dies I will regret not telling her so many things, but I just can't tell them to her now. That's just how it is and I don't want to change anything. So thank you. Good luck with everything. Maybe we'll run into each other in the future.  With Utmost Gratitude and Appreciation, Abby
