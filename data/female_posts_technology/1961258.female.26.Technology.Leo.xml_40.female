And did a great workout for 40 minutes total, plus some quick interval training right after - sprints, running up  down stairs etc. Lots of good sweat but thankfully I am definitely not as unfit as I look, I could really push myself at everything.    Saw something on Discovery called 'Faking It' where this guy who worked in the junkyard was supposed to fake it as a male model. So he had to lose 30 lbs. in  3 weeks  and he did it by having a really high protein diet, combined with 3 hours of workouts 5 days a week. Well he lost 24 lbs. in 3 weeks, then the final 6 lbs. came off after he did a colonic. I know guys lose weight faster than women but it just shows that it can be done. Lots of examples of people who  have  lost weight in a matter of weeks - the Body Challenge on Discovery, people on Body For Life, any Fitness or Shape magazine you pick up from the newstand.  It's simple, sacrifice a little these few weeks (4 - 16 weeks) then I'll be thin enough. 16 weeks x 2 lbs. a week .. that'll be 36 lbs. which is just about what I need to reach 140 and below. It's easy for me to maintain my weight, as it is right now .. it's so stagnant when I do nothing and eat however I eat - no matter whether I was 145, 155, 165 or now at 170.   I'd like to see how fast I can take it all off, and seeing as how good I did today .. I'm going to take my diet up a notch and really not do that grazing thing I did today - I took half tablespoons of things here and there, instead of eating full meals. I need to cut that out, and some of the snacking .. it's healthy stuff but not so much. It was supposed to be a liquid diet, which I didn't keep to just yet. I'll try phasing the food out and do a total liquid diet in a couple of days when I get a handle of my hunger, or especially the impulse to eat when I'm  not  hungry.  And of course the workouts, today's cardio needs to be maintained .. at least that 40 min of cardio EVERY SINGLE DAY. Then add in the interval training, to extend it to about 20 minutes and beyond .. plus a toning vid. I've had major success with Cindy Crawford's Shape Your Body .. which is kinda old and people say that some of the moves can injure you .. like the abs, where she goes too fast. But I pause it and take my time with it, so it's fine.     I'll incorporate that into my workout next week or .. maybe I'll do it later, in an hour or so.    Mini goal for the week ending Friday, 9 July 2004 is  1 - cardio 30 to 60 min, 4x minimum for the week 2 - toning vid, 2x minimum for week 3 - diet, keep at it but by next Thurs or Fri .. totally liquid diet 4 - weight goal is 168 lbs. or I want to see it dip below 170 (clearly)
