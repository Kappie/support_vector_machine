I watched Mrs. Winterborne last night and was so inlove again with Brendan Frazer ( he is really cute.. not sure though if i will choose him over Matt Damon and vice versa). It was just a nice story really.. though i don't want to be in the Connie's shoes really ( single and pregnant), but i would like to find a guy just like Bill Winterborne (maybe not as rich as he is) but as cute and loving and sweet.. sigh..oh well i know I'll have my own love story one day.. not maybe as colorful as that.. but it might be more colorful as well.. who knows, possibilites are endless and am still young.. okay back to work. urlLink
