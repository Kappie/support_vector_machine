Woke up at 6am(heaven knows why I wake up so early even on holidays), did some light exercise and then sat down to my painting work by 7:30 am.  Kindof lost interest mid way and left the painting at about 10am.  This painting was due in feb 04,but I couldnt work on it coz I simply wasnt mentally atuned at that time.  I then sat down and watched Khakee.  This movie was a little too predictable for me, but nevertheless good acting across the board.  Had a very late lunch at 3pm, as I was unable to eat anything, effect of not exactly being able to digest my breakfast, stomach and eusophagus was a complete mess!   Evening was really spent at home, except for a visit to the eye doctor to check my eye sight and see if there are any issues.  Thinking of moving to contact lens in case the power doesnt stabilize and I cant do my LASIK. Courtesy of the medicine put in my eyes, hardly could watch the tv too!  Had a pretty stormy discussion with my dad on marriage.  He was pretty bugged to the max after having that chat with me, and kindof gave me a " you just cant be corrected!" shrug at the end of the discussion!  Well, thats me, the woman who refuses to bite the bullet right now!  Sunday... Parents had to go out for a function, and granny wanted to visit our religious pontiff.  Since there was no one else to go along with her, I had to be her guide.  Had to hunt for a saree at 6am, lousy task esp since most of my mom's sarees are of rare colours!  Finally found some saree, wore it and rushed downstairs, almost tripped over.  Man, it could have been an interesting thought...sliding down the steps in a saree...rofl!Could have been a serious sight..hahaha!Anyway, the visit to the Ahobila Mutt was okay, heavy crowd since it was Independence Day and  a sunday. In all of that crowd the pontif took a few extra momemts..okay, not moments,  lot of extra moments...for me and my granny, got royally ragged by him over issues like what the mutt stood for, about my work and finally the one issue I simply hate talking about...marriage! After 20 minutes of a complete drill, I was short of running out of that place.  Reached home at 11:30am, to be greeted by my parents who were just leaving for the ceremony. I was feeling miserably down, stomach hasnt been doing too well, so decided to skip lunch.  Sat down and watched " Addicted to love"...interesting movie must say, good and hilarious...had a good laugh over it and kindof began to feel a little better. Aunt wanted some lousy matrimonial stuff to be done, finished with that, and was once again left back in a lousy mood.  Had to shift thro' a zillion profiles, for my cousin bro and a cousin sis too!  It was miserable,as I had to go thro' guys profiles and my aunt and others would comment, we could check that for u,grrrr!  Man, I hate this marriage process....so lousy!  Anyway, in the process, also got to see the ad placed by my ex's parents.  Quite an interesting ad, must say, wonder who their target audience is!  Anyway, after a lousy matrimonial hunt session, I had something to eat as I was feeling dizzy.  Was around 4pm, then decided to watch  a movie, so checked out "what a girl wants".  Nice fairy tale, warm cuddly movie must say.  This was the moment where I began to feel my emptiness, so I had to go to the temple to smooten myself out.  I then headed to my favourite temple in town at Luz, drove past the beach....amazing cool wind was blowing across, but the minute I had a look a the crowd, I just turned and headed ot the club.  Club was its usual boring self, had dinner and headed home.  Once I was back home...hmm...had an interestingly noisy discussion with my mom on the favorite topic of the house...yep, marriage...I suddenly have this funny feeling of wanting to run away from home...jsut to avoid talking about this topic!  Man, this heat is getting too much for me to handle....might just a scoot from this place!
