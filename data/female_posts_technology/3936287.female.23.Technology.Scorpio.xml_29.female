People are always in a hurry and times even rude. 3.) Central park is a huge place and is not that nice as it appears in TV. Lol 4.) Its only in NY that is China and Italy is just a block apart. 5.) Id rather be in Chicago than in New York. ( oh yah.. I love Chicago!!!!) 6.) But I want to watch all the plays in NY.. well, what can I say Im a play addict! 7.) Chicago subway is cleaner than NYs (and this is really true!!!) My firsts while I was in NY: 1.) My first time to go to a bar before Ill leave for a trip.. I usually sleep early.. 2.) Its my first time to be in NY ( of course!). 3.) The first time I got lost in the airport ( I know my way all the time!). 4.) The first time I watched a play..straight from the airport. 5.) The first time I stayed in a house near the beach and never had the opportunity to swim (beach is just 3 blocks from my aunts place). 6.) Its the first time I spent much time with my aunt. 7.) First time was able to talk to my grandpa in Hawaii 8.) I was the last one to board the plane. 9.) I was the first one to leave the plane. 10.) When I arrive in the baggage claim my bag in there already. 11.) The first time I was undecided if Ill take the taxi, airport shuttle or subway.. finally decided to take subway. Today I'm a bit confused though..might be because I've read some romance pocket books  again and as expected, I'm again in love with the thought of being in love, I'm again buying in to the idea that its really nice to spend some time with someone you love and who loves you back (aside from family and friends that is..). I know somebody will get a change to read what i've written here.. or maybe nobody will really care to read. Am i doing self pity? nope i'm not. I'm just more into  comtemplating if i'm really into this guy.. i know my friends will again say that I'm such a polaroid.. but really i can't help it, I fall fast, develop fast, don't think I recover fast though. Nope this is not really related to my NY trip haha, its more of related with my struggles with these emotions I'm hiding. Like i want to tell this guy that I really like him and i want to see if he can be the one, but i'm too scared to say really or tell him what i feel, so what happens is that I just wait and hope against hope that he will notice me someday not just a friend or someone to talk to if he is bored..oh well.. Better stop now.. that's it for now ;) urlLink
