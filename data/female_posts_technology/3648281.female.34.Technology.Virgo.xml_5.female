I've learned to make the most of the time I have with people because of this.  I've spend most of the day reflecting on the past year and thinking about what I really want to do going forward. What do I want for myself? That is a hard question. Being selfish is hard.  I guess all that I want today is to get thru the latest round of change.   I feel like traveling..... to someplace far away.
