Week 3 officially began this morning. It was a good run. I'm now running for 10.5 of the 20 minutes. I'm trying not to look too far ahead in the program. In a couple of weeks I will be running for 20mins with no break. For now I just need to get through each day.  I have been thinking about what to do after the C25K. I don't want to jump right into training for a race, because that was my downfall last time. My boss has suggested a 5k on July 16th, but I will barely be ready by then. I would rather build a solid foundation and start entering races next year.   Thoughts about after C25K: I will spend 6 weeks maintaining my base. That will be 30 minutes, 3 times per week. I will include one interval run or a hill run, and one long run each week.
