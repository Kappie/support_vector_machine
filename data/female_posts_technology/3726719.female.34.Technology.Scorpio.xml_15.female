I've also scheduled an appointment with my eye doctor for Monday morning.  The eye issue is an over-convergence thing that has been causing occassional double vision. The occassional part has gone by the wayside this week. It's almost constant when I'm at work or in meetings, and it's making me a little nauseous. Sigh...potential fixes are constant eye glasses or surgery. We'll know for sure Monday.  I had a great conversatioin with a guy online last night. He's someone I met via Yahoo personals. We haven't met in person yet - that's coming Saturday. It's nice to chat with someone who can appreciate the off-beat things I do.....Babylon 5, euchre, Good Omens by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman. We've had some really great IM conversations, so I'm looking forward to meeting him Saturday night. I'll keep you posted.  Today's funny.....I went to put on my new pair of jeans this morning. Haven't worn them yet. As it turns out, I won't be wearing them at all. One leg is at least 2" longer than the other. I got them at Walmart - they're not suppose to be irregular! :o) I'm taking them back this afternoon. So the weird jeans thing left me with having to wear a skirt today. Haven't worn a skirt in ages....and it's jeans Friday. May not be the most relaxed and comfortable.....at least I look cute!
