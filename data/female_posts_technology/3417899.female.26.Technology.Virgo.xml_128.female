Trying to figure at what or who I was so mad about, I remembered the last minutes of my dream - I was fighting with some cashier over the price of some product that he was trying to overcharge me for. The fight had escalated to shouting and just as I was about to make my point, to rest my case - I woke up.   I looked over at my alarm clock and realized I must get up  now  if I want to make in time for my 8:30 AM conference call (as always, all the important business calls take place in the morning).  I thought this over for two minutes and and decided that if I just get up and go to work - I will be in a foul mood all day - just because of the silly dream.  So I get up - send an email to my prospect telling them "something unexpected" came up and I will have to postpone our call - maybe we could do it this afternoon.   Then I go back to bed, to sleep, so that I can finish off the argument with the make-believe cashier, give him a piece of my mind, and wake up happy.
