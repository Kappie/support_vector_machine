Munched on some pistachios though (although def. not more than a handful incl. shells). My only one 'bad' thing of the day was a chocolate shortbread biscuit a couple of minutes ago.   Small progress, but it is still some progress in the right direction. I WILL lose at least 20lbs. by the end of July.
