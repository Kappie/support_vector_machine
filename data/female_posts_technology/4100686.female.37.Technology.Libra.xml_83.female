Some of the leaflets contain messages  urlLink "used to inform Iraqi people about United Nations Security Council resolutions".  Barely a day before the leaflet drop, Bush prepares to meet with two allies  urlLink "in a last-minute attempt to head off what looks to be an embarrassing defeat at the United Nations for the resolution backed by the U.S., Britain and Spain which would authorize war on Iraq."    Was that, like, pre-emptive, pre-meditative, pre-sumptuous, or just pre-posterous?
