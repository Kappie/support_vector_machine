I really like the idea of separating the idea of  work  from  paid employment . Also, it is important to separate who you  are  from what you  do .  With getting married soon, it is probably a very good idea for us both to be more fiscally aware before we merge finances. I know we both live within our means, but  how much  within our means? At what point could we become financially independent? I should start tracking this stuff. (Well, first I'm going to finish the book. Then, I'll go back and start working through the steps it contains.)
