Went bowling at Warta (not bad since there was not so many peeps but the balls are in pretty bad state. But next time i want to play in the new lane.) Manage to embarassed myself by having the ball to roll over just when i'm about to throw it -throw?( ehmmm... )and i got cheers for that haha...next time when somebody mentioning to anyone about a girl who rolls her ball off (haha!) it could be me !!!!! and i better not laugh at that! i guess since i'm in agood mood that day,the game was pretty beautiful (eheh) only to get beaten up by nudd and mimi. but considering i haven't been playing for a long, long time, i guess all was forgiven.  the rest of the week is spent on projects and assignment..*sigh*
