Twice during the day, I took my contacts out and rinsed them off and still couldn't read.  Then (11 hours later), I went to E to play trivia (gotta play Tuesday, you know).  And no matter how hard I squinted or leaned toward the television screen, I could not make out any of the questions or answers or clues.  Not one.    So, I thought that perhaps I had inadvertently put the incorrect lens in each eye.  And I went to switch them.  And I took out the left contact, and while it perched on my left index finger, I took out the right one.  And I looked and saw that the right one was actually two contacts.  So I looked back at the left one - and it was one.  After peeling the two contacts apart, I put one back in my right eye.  I know what I did.  I got up and put in my contacts and THEN showered, so when I got out of the shower, I saw a contact case lying next to the sink, and opened it up and put in my SPARE pair of contacts.  On TOP of the pair I had already put in.  And I didn't notice it when I took them out TWICE during the day to rinse them off with saline.  And, I didn't notice dropping one of the left lenses one of those times -- unless it's still in my eye...  I know, Peach - it's the blonde roots...
