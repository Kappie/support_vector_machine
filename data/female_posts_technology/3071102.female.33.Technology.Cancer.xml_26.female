Is it possible that  even after coming back from a vacation, you find that are your co-workers WERE as SURLY as you perceived them before you left, it wasn't your imagination. Is that when you know? Or is it that silent scream that is building up in the back of your throat, threatening to emerge every time that you open your mouth? Or when you want to bring in some crazy glue and get creative with those desk dwellers? Or perhaps... I just really want to be back on vacation ALREADY.... Perhaps to a sunnier, not so wet climate, get some rays, play in the surf, etc etc etc AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
