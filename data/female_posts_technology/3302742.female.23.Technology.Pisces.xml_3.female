I should point out that I'm not a spiritual person.  I'm not quite the atheist either but that's another story.  Indeed, that statement could actually act as an example of what I mean. See I think everyone contains the seeds of a multiple personality disorder.  Everything we say and do is the result of a battle between the opposite voices inside.  This isn't a new idea, but I really don't mean the opposing strains of 'good and evil'.  For me at least, both voices can be valid depending on the circumstance.  I use this theory to explain why, for instance, I can write something I believe to be genuine one week and see it as sentimental schmalz the next week.  It can also be used to explain my contradictory personality.  I live for lists and order and logic, but I'm also messy and scatterbrained most of the time.  It all depends on which 'voice' is prominent at any particular moment.  It's all about balance - yin and yang as I've said.  Opposite but in tandem.    Jesus.  This is complete armchair psychology.  Don't encourage me.
