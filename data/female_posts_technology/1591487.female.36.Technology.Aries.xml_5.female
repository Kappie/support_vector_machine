I've enjoyed the solitude immensely, but it's done nothing for my social skills.  And just think, as single occupier households are growing in numbers, there may be more and more people out there who might actually be forgetting how to converse.  It's kind of scary, but also secretly a bit of a relief, possibly. :)  Maybe the future will be silent. Sshh.   Of course, there's always the dilemma where you are so used to saying things out loud without thinking of the consequence when you live by yourself, that there's an inherent danger in doing this in public.  I need to check that the brain>mouth editor is engaged a lot more than I used to.   Also, I've been watching far too much pay television.  It's not good. I'm getting RSI from changing channels, and not just in random order. I need to start at 1 and keep going just to make sure I'm not missing something really good.  Fortunately, I never am. Although that doesn't stop me watching.  Ironically, someone gave me a notepad today with 'Things to Do' written on the top. In first place I wrote 'get a life', in second place I wrote 'find another job', in third place I wrote 'go cold turkey on Foxtel'.
