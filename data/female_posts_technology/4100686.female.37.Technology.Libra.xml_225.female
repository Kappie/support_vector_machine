With small peaces of pineapples inside it, liquid chocolate on the top, and a big cookie in the bottom of the glass, that you discover after eating everything inside it, that its eatable too, oh God o love food! Anyway :D As most of you know, I am Palestinian originally, but I live in Baghdad since 1991, I love this city, before this last war (can you name another country where its not enough to say "the war", you have to specify which war you are talking about?! ) we were in Jordan, in our summer vacation, since we have Jordanian nationalities, and we lived in Jordan, and many other countries, before coming to Iraq. As we look Iraqi (ya... the mustache, the dark skin, the tummy, you know…) and everything, since my mother is Iraqi, and I talk Iraqi "language" (as I call it) very good to the point that Iraqis who I meet in my daily life, don’t know that I am not Iraqi. But still of course, inside our house and among the family, we talk Palestinian, we eat Palestinian food most of the time, we go to Jordan every year (more than 60% of the population are Palestinians, and much more that that in Amman), so back to the subject, we were in Amman right before the war, but we took the decision to come back to Baghdad, just few days before the war, we could let Baghdad go through this alone. As arabs, not Iraqis we had a very difficult life in Saddam's time, we didn’t have the right to invest, we didn’t have the right to buy a house, we didn’t have the right to buy a car, we didn’t have the right to have a deposit account in the bank, we didn’t have the right to buy a telephone line (you can buy a phone line, but only form another arab, don’t ask me why) in a word, everything we have, everything we own, wasnt registered in our names, everything was registered in names of Iraqis, friends and relatives. What I am trying to say, that our interests were severely damaged by Saddam, I hope this answers one of the questions I read above. Have I been in jail? No why have you? But I am surprised actually that I never went to jail, or anyone of my family members, because of our stand of the bath, but thank God, we were never "caught" criticizing anything. Enough about me, I hate talking about myself, so please stop asking questions and making comments about me, this is a place to discuss Iraq, politics, not my personal life, so lets agree on something: I am tiered of the stupid stories about us benefiting from Saddam, can we get over it, and make questions a bit more relevant to the Irqi issue? I read some people talking about the debate between me and ladybird, I decline that, there is no debate here, ladybird made some comments, that I found irrelevant, and tried to answer sometimes, but there is no debate going on here, sorry! As she doesn’t live here, I was interested in showing her what is happening here, as I am in the field, and she is not, but after her funny announcement where she said: "Believe me, there is not a single Iraqi, I repeat not a single Iraqi and responsible of what I am saying is Anti-coalition from patriotic feelings. They just lost something with the fall of sad dam, they can’t say it in public and they need a mask, so anti-coalition, anti occupation is the name for the mask " after this seinfield-funny annoucement, from ladybird who KNOWS, cause she is HERE and cause she knows each one of the 22 000 000 iraqi, you must believe her guyz! Try to at least, I mean, after all, "she is responsible for what she is saying" :)) I am so out of here! Namrud is one of he most important kings in the old hesoty of Iraq, (old hestory, know what is that jeff?) and its totally impolite to make such comments on the person who used the name, rudness is the weapon of weak, if I wanted to play your game I would refer to that your name, means in arabic a ******************************, while ladybird, as my dectionary says, means *********, but i wouldnt play that game, totally not my style;) So, we are done with this, lets move on with our lives:))) I met a very hi-ranked american officer, a very interesting event, I will talk about it next time, inshalla. Take care… Me* ps: aw aw, remember that Sadr-irani thing? out of the 1200 member of Almahdi army who were caught, 4, yes only four were Iranian, best regards for your theory.
