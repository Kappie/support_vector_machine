Their reasoning is chauvinistic at best, detrimental to the well-being of hundreds of girls at most.  I hate reading crap like this.  I feel like I'm back in the freaking 18th century when I read crap like this.  Just when you think the world has made progress and become civilized, you hear about some act of chauvinism, terrorism against women, degradation of women, from another place, and you've just taken a hundred steps backward.  Because I believe that as long as there are women out there that are still treated as property to be traded, slaves, sexual objects, etc., then we as women haven't really been liberated.  The parents sending their daughters to that school should pull them out immediately.  Each and every one of them.  Then let's see whether they change their policy or not.  I'm just really frustrated.  I'm not a feminist really, or at least not a radical feminist.  I believe in the power of women though.  I believe in our strength.  I don't do anything to further women's causes, but I will do the following:  I will make sure I raise my daughter to believe in herself.  To value herself.  To be strong by herself but be wise enough to accept aid and companionship when needed.  I will raise my son to respect women, to know the value they have in his life.  To listen to their opinions without a thought in the back of his mind that his opinion is better just because he's a man.....
