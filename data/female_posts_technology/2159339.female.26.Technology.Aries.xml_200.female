So Abby, my onionpit trumps your clamhand. Green Marble used to extoll the virtues of keeping some deodorant in the office, but I didn't listen because I'm a FOOL!! To counteract I have clamped my right arm shut to contain the effluvium, but to no avail: the B.O. only feeds on itself and becomes more powerful.  In wonderful news of my wonderful new life (despite odor problem), I have a job interview on Monday morning after my dentist appointment. I really hope I do well and get the job, because I need more new and exciting things in my life. To have a major job upheaval would occupy my mind with other things than, "Why, XX, WHY?"  I am slowly regaining my senses, and enjoying life again. Yesterday was the first day of absolutely no contact with him and I hope that it continues for a lifetime. Our mutual friend Lingling said that my hostile feelings will pass, but she doesn't know my capacity to hold a grudge. I told her, "This grudge will go beyond my lifetime. I'll pass it down to my children, and my children's children! Hear me now, woman, I swear it!"  I think the only way I can forgive him is if he drunkenly crashed his car into a lightpost and he's on a hospital bed dying. I'll look down at him pityingly, tightly clasp his hand, and whisper hoarsely, "I forgive you, XX. I forgive you." Tears will spring to my eyes but I will quickly dash out of the room, my bridal train trailing behind me.  Also, not trailing behind me would be my B.O. problem, as that would have been solved by then.
