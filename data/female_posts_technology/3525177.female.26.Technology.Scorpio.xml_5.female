She is vunderba (cutesox word meaning: very wonderful)!!!    So, Saturday I once again went to my hair mecca of Salon Nula where the fabulous Nula put those gorgeous blonde highlights in and cut my hair.  Plus, she's really funny - so the two hours it takes to get everything done flies by. :)    Later I took my Little, Chelsea, to the Travs baseball game to volunteer for Big League.  It was fun, she was such a good girl and a big helper.   I finished off the day by picking up Lee Anne from the airport.  I am soo happy to have my partner in crime back :).  She even brought me a present!  - In Key West she bought me this FABULOUS purse.  If you are lucky - I will take a picture of it and post it.  It's a pink and black bustier purse with dangly beads.  Very hip.  Sunday - the adorable, wonderful, angelic, precious, beautiful, sweet, cutie ptitutie honorary niece was christened.  She looked so perfect in her little christening gown.  Her mama and daddy were glowing too.   .  She knew it was her day.  It's so interesting to be with babies and small children.  It's a miracle to look at the world through their eyes.  To see it so fresh, new and magical.    Now we go 180 degrees - Sopranos!!!  Last night was the season finale.  Last week Ade got whacked.  This week - after long speeches and proclamations that Tony S. was backing up Tony B.  - Tony Soprano drove out to the orchard and BLAM - Shot gun to the head.  Blood on the firewood.  Johnnie Sack wasn't happy.  But hey - he's been busted by the Feds - kind of serendipitous actually.  I still think that at the end of the show - Tony's gonna get whacked - or go into witness protection or something - and Paulie Walnuts will be the head of the family - to me that would be comedic.  It would send me into fits of giggles.    Round off with today - Okay - if you are going to be on TV - and there is any chance you will be within 500 feet of go-karts - wear pants.  Today, for my Big League TV spot on the Channel 7 morning show, I wore a flirty blue skirt.  And much to my surprise, the news guy was all about some go-karts.  Meanwhile, I'm in a skirt!  But, I'm not one to let a little detail like that stop me from having fun.  So, away I went holding down my skirt.  And even though I lost - I think, and the ladies in the studio agreed, I really did win the race after you add in technical adjustments for the skirt  .   But I take satisfaction in knowing that I'm a better putter than KB :)  Bwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!  Sayanora, cutesox
