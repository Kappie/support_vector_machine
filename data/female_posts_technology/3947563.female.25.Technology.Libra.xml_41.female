Two shakes, fruit for snacks. Fish for supper again. (It was a new kind today and was actually quite nasty. I'm not looking forward to eating the end of it tomorrow.) I did cave and have a coffee today however. Snack was a Danon Mousse yogurt and oh my lord it might be my new favourite food. Incredibly dessert-like, and only 70 calories. Um yeah so was my snack. Oh yeah, i almost forgot I had one chicken nugget since they came from Chez Sharron and I didn't know if they were gross. I liked them, lol.       I also got some herbal tea tonight (Sharron stop laughing) because Elisa always used to drink it and it smelled so good, but I couldn't bring myself to try it. So I was finally like screw it, it's only 1.97 if I hate it. I loved it though. I am going to start bringing it to work to help kick the afternoon coffee habit.      What else...I hit the gym tonight for 35 mins on the eliptical. I upped my gym coolness factor by very nearly having an asthma attack, and by walking into a treadmill. Oh yeah, I rule that place. Hopefully tomorrow will be less painful! Wow, I can't believe tomorrow is Thursday already. Feels like this week just got started...
