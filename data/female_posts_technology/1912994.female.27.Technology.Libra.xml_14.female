Finally, it is the way it needs to be.  got tickets to tonights lighten vs sharks game (go lightening), but not sure i will be able to make it.  oh well ---  tomorrow is halloween and i'm not dressing up - might go to a party in the evening, or might have my own little party at home... haven't completely decided.  peace out...
