I love her column not because she's trained in any way to give advice, but because she tells people what they need to hear.  You don't need to take advice just because it's given, but I think she hits it dead on quite often.  In a recent column, the writer and her husband are having trouble because the wife in a couple they are friend's with discovered her online journal which had some not nice things about the friends in it.    I bring this up because this blog is not going to be a record of everything in my life.  I won't be discussing any details about my job, the company I work for, the people I work with, my friends or my personal life.  Co-workers may be mentioned - i.e. "a guy I work with recommended this book to me."  I may mention friends - i.e. "I visited my former roomate/best friend today.  We hung out, made brownies and watched movies."  It's not my place to reveal any personal information about people who aren't me.  I may let details about myself slip, but that's my choice.
