People who call me about a computer problem, and then swear at me when I tell them to reboot.  Sorry. It's the first thing to try. And I sure as hell am not going to walk over there to do it for you. 4. My boss brought his dog to work and I can't. 5. My ankles are swelling and I forgot to take my water pill.  6. I need to go get my hair colored after work, but be home by 8 - in time for the cable guy who says he'll be there at 8 with the new box but probably won't show until 10.  7. I need to go grocery shopping and shampoo my carpets.  8. Spreadsheets. 9. Haven't had sex in 3 days. Only one time was my fault. I fell asleep... 10. Cramps. Did I mention that?
