They're off to a better place where they're not harassed to leave the house that they bought at an auction and where they don't have to pretend that they've got money and can still live a life of luxury like when they were in Iran.  The former owner and the married boyfriend went to jail. It's depressing.  I thank my parents for I did not turn out much worse than other people and that  here  is not a bad place to be.
