Jorel picked me up for lunch and I went to his store for a couple hours till mom could pick me up. I went across the street to mcdonalds for a while and sat by myself, eating and thinking...imagine when I'm older...I'll be living in toronto on my own, taking care of my own life and minding my own business...that's the way it'll be. I know I'll be successful someday. I can feel it in my hands. I WILL make my dreams come true. I am truely happy living my life even when I'm down. Though life may feel like hell, i look back on the bullshit and tell myself it's all apart of the next step towards tomorrow.          My brother told me last week about how my dad saw something in me as a child that made him picture big things for my life. My brother admitted that it hurt to hear it, but it made him wonder what people saw when they got to know him and things like that. He told me that dad has high hopes for me. Whether my brother was making it up or not...it added on to me wanting to make it sumwhere even more. The fact that my family knows how to make me smile and they know how to live a happy life while also making others happy, is a big reason as to why I know I can be sumbody. They'll be there to support me. They respect me and I respect them. Everything I do will not only be for my sake, but for theres to say thank you to them for being such wonderful parents...yeah...they don't know it...but they are.           I met up with Amanda, Kevin and Tom tonight for a movie. We saw I Robot and I thought it was good. I liked it. Lotsa good stuff in it. At the end of the movie I chucked the pop corn bag over Kevin's head and he ended up taking th leftovers and getting me back. Ah, good times, good times...            Tomorrow I'm hoping to meet up with Josh at elements, but I'm supposed to be in toronto for my dad's b'day get together. I think I can get out of it. We already had his b'day party. This one is just basically meeting up with my aunt. I wanna go dancing again! It'll be my new workout! Ha! Josh will be going to New York for a week so I'm hoping to see him before he goes. *sigh* everyone is so far away... yep, megan's in vermont, shawn's in winnipeg, heathers in algonquin, god knows where mike is, mom and opa are going to the phillippines for a month, may's going to florida for a week...Oh well, I've got amanda and kevin to keep me smiling and busy!                    She looked back...and she became a pillar of salt...  -The Lonewolf
