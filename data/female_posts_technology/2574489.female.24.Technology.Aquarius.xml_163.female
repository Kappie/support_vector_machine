I mean, c'mon, she was the one leading Harry through the time turner thing, she's the one who did the wand trick that got Sirius out of the cell in time...if I'm ruining the movie for you , sorry.  I just love Hermione! There's actually scores of people that think Hermione really carries the book and not Harry Potter, despite the titles. :)  And I feel so stupid, but I get  kilig  during those few and far between moments that Ron and Hermione show affection for each other, a preview of things to come.  As a disclaimer, I am an avid Harry Potter fan. I even took myself and my little brother to the midnight launch of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix at Barnes and Noble the day it came out.   One funny anectode: I was trying to imitate Hermione's very kick-ass way of unlocking the cell door using the Alohomora spell and my shoulder bag went up and its strap hit me on the face! I swear, sometimes, I am too goofy for words.
