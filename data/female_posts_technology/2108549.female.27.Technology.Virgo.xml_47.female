Everything is going as it should I guess, its just been too much for me and when I have had the time to sit and write, I have instead just shut down.  Its been necessary.    I saw Jars of Clay last night with Caedmon's Call an they put on an awesome show.  Saturday night was Girls' Movie night and it was nice.  We ended up sitting around and talking instead of actually watching a movie but the conversation was good.  I have the beginnings of a new life falling into place and its good.  I'm scared though and that tempers the excitement. Studying, women friends that want nothing more than friendship, housesitting, new job, new car, new well.... me.  I guess its normal.    It's amazing to me that people actually trust me with things like housekeys and their house.   I start housesitting for 6 months on the 24th.  I'm happy about it, a little scared about it, however I am mostly looking forward to the space it is going to give Freedom and I.  He'll have a huge backyard and I'll have a 3 bedroom house to roam around in.  Its a good thing.
