I will leave you with Anastacia to begin your day.  Blessed Be!   Welcome to My Truth  ~Anastacia   Sentimental days  In a misty clouded haze  Of a memory that now feels untrue  I used to feel disguised  Now I leave the mask behind  Painting pictures that aren't so blue  The pages I've turned are the lessons I've learned   Somebody bring up the lights I want you to see  (Don't You Feel Sorry For Me)  My life turned around  But I'm still living my dreams  (Yes it's true I've been)  I've been through it all  Hit about a million walls  Welcome to my truth.. I still love  Welcome to my truth.. I still love   Tangled in a web  With a pain hard to forget  That was a time that I've now put to rest  Oh, the pages I've turned are the lessons I've learned   Somebody bring up the lights I want you to see  (Don't You Feel Sorry For Me)  My life turned around  But I'm still living my dreams  (Yes it's true I've been)  I've been through it all  Hit about a million walls  Welcome to my truth.. I still love  Welcome to my truth.. I still love   Sentimental days  In a mist of clouded haze  Of a memory that now feels untrue   Somebody bring up the lights I want you to see  (Don't You Feel Sorry For Me)  My life turned around  But I'm still living my dreams  (Yes it's true I've been)  I've been through it all  Hit about a million walls  Welcome to my truth.. I still love  Welcome to my truth.. I still love
