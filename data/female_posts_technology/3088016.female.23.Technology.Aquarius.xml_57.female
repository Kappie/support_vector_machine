I went through about half a dozen iterations of clicking "some random blog" on my nav bar when I realized that although there are hundreds of thousands of blogs on the 'net, most of them (a) don't have nearly as much attention paid to detail or (b) are just not meant for my type of audience.   For example, this is the last one I read.  It was disheartening enough to make me give up for the night.  I do believe that it's based loosely on English, but that's about all I can tell.  Are these my blogging peers?       in sch now... in a happy mood. hahah yesterday played bball at bukit merah. quite fun sia... hahah played rat and horse... hahaha .... sch sucks manz.,... nothing to do now hahahahhah well nothing to blog now ... ciaoz
