After a few hours in the water we landed on Talames Beach and, realizing that we were the only ones there, took a few minutes to stare at the tiny little cars driving on the other side of the bay. I knew what M was thinking because I was thinking it too - Are we going to make it through the weekend without hurting/killing each other? We had joked about bringing along a list of conversation topics we would refer to if the urge to stab each other ever came up, but no such list was ever compiled and now we were shipwrecked.  After unpacking the kayak (one tent, two sleeping bags, two sleeping pads, 2 bottles of wine, 6 wooden logs, way too much food, etc.), it was time to play ‘first man, first woman’. And I don't mean procreate. I mean setting up shelter and making some food. So naturally, being the gatherer without the need to gather, I read my chemistry book while he built a fire,  finished the first bottle of wine as he cooked dinner (pasta  salmon in alfredo sauce), took a nap as he cleaned up. In my defense, I did put up the tent and gave him pointers on cooking and cleaning, which, to my shock and dismay, he didn't appreciate. Then we took a walk in the mountains (which smelled like cow poop). When it got dark, the wind picked up and I got in the tent. Then began the bird wailing - loud, high-pitched crying that sounded like a beach full of pregnant woman giving birth, which kept me up until about 1 am. At one point I made M get out and check to make sure that it were birds indeed.  The next morning we hung out on the beach, ate eggs  bagels and drank coffee. It felt so peaceful and nice to not have to think about work or family or bills or my messy closet. My phone didn't get reception and there was no email access anywhere on the beach. Since then M  I have been emailing each other kayak links.
