Bend it like Beckham  tops this year's line-up of cinematic gems. The fil is about two 18-year old girls playing football. Both girls dream of playing professionally, and are on their way with help from their coach, Joe when they fall in-love with him  Other film titles scheduled for the film festival are  Born Romantic  and  Divorcing Jack . Alongside this, in collaboration with BBC, a selection of TV materials to include  Absolutely Fabulous  (comedy),  Pride and Prejudice  (classical drama) and  Wallace and Grommit  (animation) will also be shown at the British Council Information Centre.  Wallace, the eccentric and naive, cheese-loving inventor and his faithful dog, Grommit were introduced to the world when the film A Grand Day Out was nominated for an Academy Award in 1989. The entertaining comic-book story revolves around the adventures of the somewhat inept Wallace and the real brains behind the partnership, Grommit.
