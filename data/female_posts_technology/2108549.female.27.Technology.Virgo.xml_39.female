I like it there though, I have plenty of time to study should I choose to, I love the guys I work with. Financially even if I got that apartment, I could swing it.   It appears though that I might be offered a position with another company. As a database analyst. Something I would have to learn. Major stress there. But its about $5k a year more, permanent and with benefits. Its a longer commute as well. Its also a great opportunity and the money would be nice.   I don't know what to do. I am thinking about talking to my current boss, not as an ultimatum by any means, more though as a help! type thing. If they were to take me on permanent, even at the rate of pay I make now, I would stay there over going to this new job. I'm safe there, comfortable there, happy there and the money just wouldn't be worth it. But I need benefits. I need sick days. I need vacation days. I need to know my job is definitely going to be longer than 3 months. Especially before committing myself to this apartment.  Help.
