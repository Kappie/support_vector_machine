She confided so much to me and I would advise her what I would do, etc.  Things got crazy in 2001 though.  Both her own father (I had been separated from since 1989 and divorced officially since 1991) and I had found other people to get married to.  Her father had been out of her life for many years prior to that and started showering her with gifts.  She was beginning to think that the grass was much greener on the other side and started throwing things like, "My daddy will buy that for me", "Daddy would let me do that", etc.   I wasn't in a position to give in or compete and I did the hardest thing for me to do -- take her to her Dad's to live @ 14 years age.  Last September (almost a complete year after my husband I was married to in 2001 died from a heart attack), she had asked me to move back to Austin, and again I was faced with a little bit of competition, i.e. "I'll move in with you if you will buy me a pillow top mattress" etc.  I, again, was not in a position to compete or give in; so, I did not.  Tonight, she surprised the heck out of me by announcing that she was going to move back in with me!!  I was pleasantly shocked and amazed.  My little daughter is actually growing up.  I had hoped that I would hear her utter those words long before now; however, I don't want to jinx myself yet.  Right now, she is asleep in my bed.  I love having her back...  Sometimes, I guess, a little firmness in a stance actually does pay off in the end.  I pray to God that he blesses her soul for some good decisions that she has been making recently and continues to watch over her as she proceeds onward with her life journey.
