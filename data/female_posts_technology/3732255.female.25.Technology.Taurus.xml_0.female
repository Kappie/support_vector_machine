This is only the second time (since Another State of Mind) that the group has been captured on film. This event was filmed on January 19, 2003, at the House of Blues in Anaheim, CA, and will feature back stage footage, interviews, a photo gallery and more.   “ Live In Orange County” spans the guys extensive history, and will take you from “Mommy’s Little Monster” through “White Light, White Heat, White Trash”, and includes two never before released songs, “Footprints On My Ceiling” and “I Wasn’t Born To Follow”. Both songs are to be included on Social Distortion’s forthcoming studio album due out later this year.
