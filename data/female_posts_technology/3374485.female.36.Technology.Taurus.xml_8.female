Yep, he is being true to his own nature, yep its all down to headline-grabbing shock-script editors (I know that doesn't rhyme like shock-jock does), but I like Sarah and therefore I don't like Todd. Mind you, I don't like Gail either. Or Martin. Or Katy and her solid-state hair. Or indeed Karl. But I DO like Audrey, and Todd has upset Audrey so therefore I am upset about him all over again. Good job I don't watch any of the other soaps! Or does The Bill count as a soap? I have MAJOR opinions about people in The Bill.......
