It was TJ MAXX, harassing me about going dancing with him at some new bar-club on Polk. Since I already had plans to take Thursday off, I called him back and told him I'll pick him up at 10:45. Despite my initial hesitation about going and my predictions of spending 3 hours watching scenesters trying to out-cool each other, it turned into an pretty fun night. Me, TJ, TJ's ex MK, JJ Fad's ex and her new girlfriend, all completely smashed and dancing to early 90's hits by such talented singer-songwriters as En Vogue, Digital Underground and Sir Mix-A-Lot as well as some new stuff. I was seeing double by the time we left, so I asked TJ to drive. At his house 15 scary minutes later, he revealed that he, too, was completely wasted and was 'just trying to do what all the other cars were doing'. Thank you lord jesus for getting us safely to TJ's abode. So that was Wednesday.   On Thursday, anticipating a day of much needed rest and relaxation, I drove home, called in sick, and got into my soft warm bed. Ten minutes later, Marcus called and told me to be ready to go to the sweatshop in 45 minutes. Fuck!!, I thought, that's why I took the day off, not to nurse my monster hangover. At the factory, Marcus explained to me how the whole operation works. I tried to pay attention, but all the machines were too intriguing, so every ten minutes I took breaks and ran around the floor. I had to hold myself back from jumping into the enormous piles of felt and cotton scraps on the floor. After that, Marcus got me my very own Costco card and we went out to lunch in chinatown. Then it was time to go to chem class.   It's finally Friday and I'm counting minutes until I can go home and veg out in my pajamas. Mike is back on Sunday. After finishing his scarf, I decided to keep it for myself, so I have to churn out another one by then. In addition to all the other stuff I was planning to get him for christmas but never did. He wrote that he lost weight in the last 6 weeks so maybe I'll roast a chicken on Sunday or something.
