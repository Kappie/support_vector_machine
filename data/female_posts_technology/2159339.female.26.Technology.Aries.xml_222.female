I'd seen Azure Ray in December at BOTH, opening for Crooked Fingers but I was too nervous (my first date with XX) to pay attention. I remember it being really slow, but my heart was racing. It's hard to be attentive when you're freaking out and really anxious. After the show, W-gal burned me their CD, Hold on Love, which after several listens becomes stronger and stronger. It's a solid album, if you like slow sad music. So for this show, I was prepared. I knew one album intimately and I also drank a strong cup of coffee.   Okkervil River: OK, kind of boring.   The Elected: Solid. Alt-countryish w/ the right amount of noise. Great melodies. They're on Subpop and the lead singer is also in Rilo Kiley. (Listening to the CD, the first song is totally Chris Isaak, while the rest of the album is acoustic guitar with some jangly countryish twang, but the singing/mood is whispery and melancholic like Elliot Smith.)  Azure Ray: Beautiful. Beautiful show. My favorite of the two girls is Orenda. She's the non-goth. Her singing and delivery is so subtle, but so moving. Her delicate facial expressions and the sad vibrato of her clear voice is balm to my heart. I got a lump in my throat during the first song she sang because it was so quiet and sad and pretty. The girls barely strum and they barely sing above a quiet indoor voice but this time around, I understood. I got it. I get it.
