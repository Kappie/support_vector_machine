Time is relative, Earth is continuous, Life is about change.  A mother has a baby, A new cycle of life begins, As a grandmother dies, and ends an old life cycle.  It's hard to think, It's hard to feel, I just want to be me, and yet, I can't go back.  Time has changed me, For the better or the worse, Only I can  know.  I dream of times gone by, and times yet to come, I wish, I wish, I wish.  All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003
