When I first read this story I thought that he was talking about the clutter that we have in our lives through material possesions. But as I read on I soon came to realize that he meant through one's writing and how as a society we have learned to not be able to cut to the chase. Throughout this essay he states that we should simpliflyour lives by looking at our writing and changing it. I know that this might seem hard but it can be done so says the authorof Clutter. So Simplify, sinplify and your life will be better.
