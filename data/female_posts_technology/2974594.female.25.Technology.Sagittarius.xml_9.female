I think it's such a classic band with such soulful tunes that I just have to appreciate each and every song on every album. Who can say no to Simply Red's music...Sometimes with a touch of reggae, sometimes R, most times jazzy..Lovee 'em!  It's been a tiring two weeks for me. Running here and there just to be sure I won’t miss one bit of happy moment in my life. Works been crazy as usual, I can’t believe these accountants cant figure out their finance management and reporting since the company started its business!!  It's all haywire and we have to help them figure it out.  Imagine their own people can’t even figure their own financial system and process...how bout us outsiders trying our best to figure it out for them. CHAOS!   I'm wishing for time off to go to the beach and expose my skin to some sun, sea and fresh air right now. Traffic's like shitty these days, it's killing my patience! Need some peace of mind...but where can one find some peace of mind here in the heart of KL??? Back in Penang I could go to the beach anytime I wanted to and it's just 2 bus rides away from my apartment. Here...I’m just stuck. it's traffic everywhere, no sign of the ocean; it's the office, crowded shopping malls or home. I don’t mind the city really, but it's just suffocating at times for me. Being so used to be near the beach, seeing the horizon, finding peace of mind while listening to the waves...man, where does one find such peace of mind here in the city?  MT came back in my life out of no where...and proposed. Man, I think he could have done better than what he did. a shock to me without doubt but I don’t really care anymore since I’ve got no feelings left in me for him. I’m assuming it's the distraction and attraction to DC that has caused me to feel nothing for anyone else, which means I might end up alone as always for denying other men and giving my all to DC...just like how I did with RT. What is the difference between what I have now with DC and RT? the difference is that DC reveals his feelings for me, and RT didn’t. but hey, in the end of the day I’m just going to be all alone by myself anyways, so why bother worrying about shitz like that. For sure I don’t think I can pretend and accept MT's proposal just coz everyone's getting married and having babies of their own. I can’t even pretend and live a superficial lifestyle just coz it's convenient for me...let alone with reasons to get back to some bitch out there. I'm not that kinda person.. so yeah, rationally, don’t think I’ll be marrying MT anytime soon or ever.  DC and I are in our second month now. feels like I’ve known him for ages tho and yet discovering something amazing every single time I’m out with him. it's just been a magical journey of course, all day everyday. am predicting some change toward mid next month since he's gonna move to a different location. I’m gonna miss him so much, too much. I'll keep holding on...to whatever than I’m suppose to hold on to. DC speaks to me of   FOREVER...IMMORTALITY  ..I hope I’ll live to see the ending of this twisted episode in my life. Never was there a time that my heart does not ache every time he speaks of the other half...after all, I am the fool in love...
