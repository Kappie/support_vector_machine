It was refreshing, just enough water to float around in, but not so much that it's overwhelming.  Not too much to do in there though.  We don't have any water toys or television or music out on our patio.  Just the neighbor's dog barking and the very, very, very loud air unit that never seems to stop.  It seems to vibrate even louder when there is water nearby for some reason; like it echoes heavier.  After our swim, I went for a walk with our neighbor Trudy.  It's really fun when I get the chance to walk with her because she's a really nice person, and I enjoy talking with her about life.  It's been quite a long time since I've made a new friend that I can really talk to, so I'm not sure if I'm doing a good job of it.  We're supposed to get together on Saturday to watch a movie, and I'm looking forward to that.  Andrew is going netgaming this Saturday so we should have the house to ourselves and can chat the night away.  Exercising, then stretching in the pool, then walking 2.1 miles in 100 degree heat was maybe not such a great idea.  Boy oh boy am I sore today.  I did NOT want to get out of bed this morning.  *Uuuuu...  snoooze... please... hit the snooze...button...*    I'm glad that this week I'm on the light duty for work.  Thursday starts the second-most heavy duty, Reporting.  Right now I'm on Mitigation which doesn't entail much work.  Change is the worst though, by far the heaviest and most complicated.  Duplicates is third in the rank, but that was last week.  We rotate through so each of us experiences the duties once every five weeks.  My coworkers are really nice, so that is helpful.  I've only been in this new job for 8 weeks now.  Considering the first 5 weeks was daily training, I've only really been working for real for the past 2 1/2 weeks.    In other news, my DaD is moving his family to a new house up in Michigan.  They are only moving about 4 miles from where they have been living since 2000, but it's a big move for them.  He and his wife have my little brother to move, not just themselves.  Noah is 7 months old and starting to pull himself up on things.  It's hard enough watching him with a house where you know the placement of everything, but during a move everything will be dishelved.  I sure hope it goes well and the boxes get unpacked quickly!  Time for me to get back to work...
