I mean who comes up with these types of clothes ..probably the same guys who invented Playboy …and have u ever tried buying a bikini.. I mean no matter what style u get your thighs will never look proportional to your ankles.. so in turn your butt looks flat and your boobs look small…so u decided on a stupid one piece which will ruin your tan but will cover your oprah sized tooshie… but the bad thing is if you have the slightest bit of flab around your midriff ..it’s over.. that one piece will magnify itself 100 times to the bloody 10th power… one tiny roll of fat will look like your pregnant with septuplets… that’s why smart desi women should wear boxer bikini’s with a halter tops… this style allows u to cover those thunder thighs and enhance those size A’s…and might I also add it makes that tiny roll of flesh in your tummy area virtually disappear…. So all your desi chicks out there strut your stuff and have fun in the sun…I know I will…    Question of the Day:    What do you think looks awful on desi chicks…?
