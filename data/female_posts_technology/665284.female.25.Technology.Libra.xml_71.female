How many houses/apartments have you lived in throughout your life?  - My grandparents house on my mother's side - My grandparents house on my father's side - The apartment in Manila 3   2. Which was your favorite and why?  - The current place which is the apartment in Manila because it's in the city and most of my growing up years were spent in this city.  It is near UST where there are lots of trees.  It's near a lot of retail stores, malls and the Walled City of Manila.   3. Do you find moving house more exciting or stressful? Why?  - I was too young to appreciate moving out.  I never left since I got to where I live right now.  In theory, maybe if the place I'm going to is my own house or somewhere that is really great and better than where I am then I'd be excited.   4. What's more important, location or price?  - Price   5. What features does your dream house have (pool, spa bath, big yard, etc.)?  - It would have stained-glass windows.  Well part anyway.  Or if not reall stained-glass then glass art.  I have always thought that part of my house would have a domed roof.  The roof of my room anyway =)  It would have a side or backdoor to a raised walkway placed over a mini-river or pond.  My house would be airy, a bit minimalist.
