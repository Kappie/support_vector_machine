But mainly, we meant it for Mama, to smoothen out her recuperating period. Thinking of it, the last time we went out with full strength of us 6, was last Eiduladha.    Since the 2 madames of the 2 households justifiably let to surrender their pots and pans, we decide to had early lunch at the most-talk-eatery-at-nook-of-Geylang-Serai Hajah Maimunah. I am not exactly a fancy of rice-as-staple-food diet, but I really took a fancy on its roasted chicken and sambal cockles. I better at least enjoy it, after sheer surviving of its horrenduously long Q and in scavenge for that decent table of 6.    After the lunch, we X-over to Joo Chiat complex with Mama in hunt for that perrrrrfect rug for the room. Hubby managed to grab the 'magic   charcoal  ' for his sheesha activities. And brother ..... I have to start on a new paragraph for this .....    He bought an ointment, Minyak Firdaus, to boost growth of moustaches and beards. That is such an amazing discovery for me. He wants to grow a goatee as a significant to proclaim his independence of NS. Better show me the result...    Sister and I hit the 'Musical Records'. Sister managed to get her hands on the 'Budak Dini' latest album, while I was disappointed that the super-unfriendly-plus-faggodish-salesman-with-cutting-like-that-budak-apis-glam simply told me that the i-look-i-look-i-see album is no more. Yet, I wasted my 10 bux on that PHSM vcd, which is so disappointingly unscary. But I fell in love with its theme song, that I keep humming to it 'scarily'.    The weather was so fine that later on, we were positive to hit the Pasir Ris Beach/Park. Not exactly having a picnic, but we did lay out our picnic mat, and bring out the 'picnic basket' of kueh we bought from Hajah Maimunah. We grabbed bottles of drinks and ice-cream from a nearby to succumb into some cooling in the midst of the heat.    With Mr Good Wind blowing, we decided to bring out the kite. Many kite-flyers were green-eyed, seeing our Last Kite Flying, not tangled at all to the trees. Must see hor ..... who the expert kite-flyer ..... The Hubby.      Brother met up with some of his sea-activities friends, who were training some novices on canoeing and sailing. Brother said, they offered us free tries on the canoe and sailing boat. But we skipped the idea lookin at us geared, unprepared to be very wet. But I managed to kick some saltwater plus sand towards hubby, in revenge to his attempt to throw me and sister into the water.    At the children's playground, I was hoping to hop on the 'mini wired flying fox'. But with the visible  WARNING   sign against adults to hop on it, I simply had to drop the idea. Furthermore, there were so many kiddies around, and I don't think I want to invite spectators to my intention.        So after that, we settled down to some bicycle-riding action. We had so much fun, till we were hungry again. We packed up, left the place, and head to Changi Village, to ta-pao nasi lemak. Our favorite stall was closed, so we settled with another stall, the few recommended by Makansutra. Yet, its taste doesn't enliven our tastebuds. Last dash, before we left CV, managed to grab 6 packets of fresh sugarcane juice with  lemon  to quench our thirst throughout the journey back to Woodlands.        While, I'm typing this, hubby is heavily engaged on the television with the running of PGA: British Tour 'LIVE'. Thank God, it's the last day today. He has been over-feeding me with golf jargons like  green , approach, rough, backspin, which yeah ... do not sound jargon. He even handed out his first golf handbook which was written by that famous 'living brand' Arnold Palmer. Well, for now I finally understand what is birdie putt and boogey.
