My boyfriend thinks there is something wrong with me and I should go to the doctor. But I know I am just a clutz. Two came from getting out of my jeep.  I need nerf bars or something.  Two are from when he bounced me off the teeter totter.  His daughter landed under me and was fine.  So I only have one that is unaccounted for.  I probably walked into something and just don't remember.   I remember last year for my friend's birthday we did jello wrestling. My knees were completely purple for 2 weeks. My friends were all pretty much fine.  I look like someone beat me.
