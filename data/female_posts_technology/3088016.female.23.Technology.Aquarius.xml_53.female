I took a  urlLink CNN quiz  to see "which vacation best suits [my] personality for 'finding hidden treasures'."  It ended up telling me that my ideal vacation is the Gilroy Garlic Festival.  Nice try, but nowhere close.   That said, I'm really looking forward to my vacation to Chicago this coming weekend.  I'll be there in 5 days and counting!
