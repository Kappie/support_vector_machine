For being single and not buying anything for the animals, I still don't get how I spent as much as I did.  However I have a ton of food in the house now and many many many meals I can fix.  Spoke with the landlord today and the General Contractor is supposed to come over Thursday to fix the short in the walls for the phone and finish off making the entire building cable ready.  Things are settling in, last night I got my electric blanket on the bed and between the featherbed, the electric blanket, the down comforter and 3 cats and a dog, I was toasty last night.  I love having the house cold and the bed all warm snuggly.  It does make it so hard to get out of bed in the morning though!  Things are good, I'm just blue I guess.  I don't know how to describe.  Everything is wonderful with my life and I have nothing to want or need for and really not a thing to complain about, yet I still feel vaguely down.  I can't explain it.  Maybe its just the time of year it is.    Freedom and I went for a walk last night sort of late and before I realized it I was in an area largely populated with homeless people and I felt a twinge of fear at first.  No one had done anything to me or even given me a reason to be scared.  But Freedom and I kept on and got to say hi to people we had never met.  Next thing I knew I was back home and we were safe and sound.  I think I like it there.  Maybe it'll keep me humble.
