Dr. Joyce Brothers  Psychologist and Television Personality   Trust is an underlying factor in every relationship.  The other day I spied a young couple at work sitting in cubicles next to each other; the woman heavily involved in her work; the man heavily involved in his work, but exploring the Y! personals while he was talking to customers in a minimized screen format so as to not be obvious.  Is it my responsibility to tell this young woman that her beau is perusing other possibilities??? I don't think so.  The young man's actions will catch up with him eventually -- especially, if they are even remotely dishonorable.  Perhaps, he is just exploring the possibilities before he asks her to marry him.  They make such a perfect looking couple. She has kids from a prior marriage and they are all living together.  I don't want to rock the boat if he is just looking to see what might be out there before he makes the life-long committment.  Hopefully, though, she won't be oblivious and distracted too much to see this behaviour and to not be in touch with her own instincts.  Trust is the foundation towards any relationship and if you cannot have that trust built firmly into your relationship, you truly don't have a relationship that will last.  Relationships built on distrust and deceipts can never last.   Ephesians 4:14 -- "Then we will no longer be like children, forever changing our minds about what we believe because someone has told us something different or because someone has deverly lied to us and made the lie sound like the truth."  Ephesians 4:15 -- "Instead, we will hold to the truth in love, becoming more and more in every way like Christ, who is the head of his body, the Church."  2 John -- "the truth that lives in us and will be in our hearts forever."   Part of finding a soulmate is largely determined by the amount of trust one can trust in the other, which is largely fully trusted until proven wrong.  Once proven wrong, it is difficult to truly rebuild that trust completely.  If any counselor is telling you that it is possible to rebuild that trust is only telling you that to build your confidence in the opportunities of rebuilding a relationship, but isn't being completely truthful to you.  The only time this because more than just a mere possibility is when both parties reside themselves to being completely honest and truthful to the other in order to rebuild the trust that became wavering.  The only thing to truly trust is your instincts; they are rarely wrong.  Any flags that are being sent up should be acknowledged and dealt with directly and head on before the situation escalates and becomes out of control and/or a relationship is inadvertently built upon lies and deceipts.  Prayers go to the couple that was observed the other day and anyone else who might be living lies and non-truths through distrusting and deceiptful ways of living.  Life is too short to waste in untrustworthy or deceiptful ways of living!! :)
