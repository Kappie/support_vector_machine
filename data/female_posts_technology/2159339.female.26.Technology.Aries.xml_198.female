What I already know is that XX and I had lots of unprotected sex, and before me, he was a dog. We're talking one-night-stands-on-the-road kind of dog. I didn't ask him to get tested because I wanted him to like me. I didn't ask him to use a condom because he didn't have any our first night and I wanted to get laid. I'm not going to do that anymore for anyone. I just read an article in Newsweek about a moratorium in the porn industry because one actor recently tested positive. He also infected at least one more person: a 19-year old actress. 19 and HIV-positive! That is scary and I'm going to err on the side of precaution from now on. I will think with my brain instead of my internal boner.   Sometimes late at night, I'm seconds away from dialing up XX and saying, forget it, let's just have a good time, roll around, romp, all that: No commitments. Then I figure, why do I need him? I don't. Why should I compromise myself? I shouldn't! I can't divorce physical intimacy from emotional intimacy so I end up turning off my phone and doing the deed with myself. Because I love me and I'll always be around for me. I would never tell me, "You know what? You don't look good in green" or when I ask myself to be true I don't sigh loudly and say, "I guess so. It's not like there's anyone else right now." After my O, my thoughts are clear and I remember what I truly want: Love.  Sex ruins things. My emotions get involved, then in the very end when the guy leaves (XX aka "Fucko") I'm hurt and confused. I can't just have sex with people. I don't care if I'm treading a trail to spinsterhood. I don't care if I have to wait 1 year, or 2 years, or beyond my lifetime for someone special. I'm going to wait until there's mutual love before I have sex again. I'm going to wait for love in the way that I want it and if it doesn't happen during this life, I will wait until the next.
