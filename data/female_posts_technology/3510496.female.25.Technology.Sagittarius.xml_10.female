He left our sunny island   to recoup back his spirit after losing a very loved one in a plane crash.   Ok, I am not going to spin sad stories here. More of something this friend picked up while he was there. Like calling potatoes as 'murphy' and milk as 'moo juice'  . I happened to recently did some 'research' reading, and 'bang' on a bank of American diner slangs. Share with you all some.   Adam's ale ............... Plain water (over here, sometimes we call 'sky juice')  wreck 'em ................ scrambled eggs  on wheels ................ take-out (ta-pao)  haemorrhage .............. ketchup  sea dust ................. salt  belch water .............. soda water  bucket of hail ........... glass of ice  yum-yum/sand.............. sugar  java/joe ................. coffee  life-preserver ........... donut  breath ................... onions  looseners ................ prunes  hounds on an island ...... sausage on beans  shingles with a shimmy ... toast and jam  2 cows, make them cry .... 2 hamburgers with onions  burn the British ......... toasted muffins  wreath ................... cabbage  Eve with a lid on ........ apple pie (think of America Pie movie, hahah!)  lumber ................... toothpick  mike  'ike/side-arms .... salt  pepper  no cow ................... without milk  a squeeze ................ orange juice  warts .................... olives  axle grease .............. butter   'I would like to order  shingles with shimmy . Errr could you spread a bit of  axle grease  on the toast. And could I have a bowl of salad with generous  wreath  and tomato. Make sure there's no  breath  because I abhor the smell and taste of it. I will have my cup of  joe  decaf, with  no cow . Oh, I will stir the  yum-yum  in it myself.'       Vietnamese Steak Sandwich       total time: 20 minutes | makes 3 sandwiches  This is actually an adapted recipe which I slightly modified.   1 6-ounce steak meat about 1 inch thick 1 tsp of Thai chili sauce (Maggi brand) 4 tsp of sugar 1 1/2 tsp of fish sauce (Knife brand, promote my co's prod) 1 tsp of minced garlic 1 cup Apple Cider Vinegar (Heinz brand, original suggestion is to use rice wine) 1 medium carrot, cut into matchsticks 1/2 medium green bell pepper, thinly sliced 4 tbsp of low-fat mayo (Bestfood) 1 baguette from Delifrance, sliced horizontally 6 sprigs of Chinese parsley (can get from Pasar)  Pre-heat oven to 225 degree celsius. Place the steak on a bowl. Add chili sauce, sugar, fish sauce and garlic, and marinate well. Set aside.   Place vinegar in saucepan over medium heat. Toss the carrots and bell pepper in. Cook for a while, remove from heat and set aside.   Place the steak in the oven and cook around 6 minutes per side (medium rare). Meanwhile spread the mayo on the baguette. Heat the open baguette with mayo-side up until mayo melts and baguette turns crispy.  Cut the steak into 3/4 inch-thick slices. Fill the baguette with the cooked vegetable and steak, and top with Chinese parsley. Sliced the baguette into 3 and serve.  2 down, 5 more to go!
