I think the word 'stalking' and indeed, the concept, has become one of those with such an overuse in general conversation that it's meaning has been dumbed down a bit. Stalking is quite a serious issue, 'real' stalking that is, the criminal offence kind.  People seem to use it for all sorts of situations, including just being interested in other people's lives! (god forbid!) I asked someone a question once about whereabouts they lived or some other innocuous comment and the immediate response was 'Are you stalking me?'.  And I've just realised that I've used it myself in a previous post too! Gosh, I'm a hyprocrite.  Okay, I now vow never to use the word 'stalking' in an inappropriate context again.  Anyway, enough of that unpleasantness.  This afternoon, we have been trying to work out ways to put drops in dogs'ears. Lovely colleague, Susan, has  two labradors whom she loves dearly, and fair enough, they're beautiful.  However, the black one has an ear infection which needs drops, but unfortunately is making it very difficult to allow his owners to do this.   Being a bit of clever dog, he's cottoned onto the fact that when both mother and father come out with some treats and a calming voice, that something is up, so makes a bit of run for it. Sadly, the vet wasn't that helpful with tips, so we've resorted to the web and found some useful information.  My suggestion of giving the dog a general anaesthetic each time didn't seem practical, so tonight they're going to try a couple of the tips recommended by the University of Washington State Veterinary School. Good luck!
