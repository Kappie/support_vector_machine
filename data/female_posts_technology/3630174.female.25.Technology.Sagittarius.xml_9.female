I spent the first two nights at my parents' Fruit Orchard in Kalai (about 60km from Baling), helping them to pick up durians and to pick other fruits like mangosteens and rambutans.  Had some nice chats with my mom, and like magic, she managed to set things straight in my mind...without even knowing she did it. That's a mother's power. And my dad, as usual, his funny self. Always make me laugh :)  My grandpa is as healthy as ever, although he's over 80 yrs old. Pretty amazing old man.  Well, as i said, back to work!
