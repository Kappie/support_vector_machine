I'm hanging out with Green Marble's bf who is obsessed with " urlLink Texas Justice ."   Yesterday we walked all the way to the beach then all the way back. We took our blood pressures at Rite Aid at "The Geary Mall" and The Safeway on La Playa. He's lost a substantial amount of weight, while I've gained a substantial amount of weight, so when we stood on the scale at Rite Aid, we basically weighed the same though he is MALE and TALLER THAN ME!!!   In family news, we've all collectively gained weight, so there's a bet. It started with my brother. He's an ace gambler and loves to wager so he bet my narcoleptic cousin-in-law P. Diddy, his chubby equal, fifty bucks for fifteen pounds. Whoever loses 15 lbs first gets $50. Then all the other guys got in on it too. The bigger bet is whoever loses the most weight by August 20--the eve of my cousin Duck-duck's dam hoi (engagement ceremony)--wins. The players include my brother, P.Diddy, the fiancee, and P.Diddy's brother.   I'm secretly competing too, but shhhh. It's because relatives like to poke my brother in the gut and go, "Chubby! Chubby!" while I titter nearby. If he loses the weight, I do not want them to re-direct their pointy fingers to the nearest gut:  mine .
