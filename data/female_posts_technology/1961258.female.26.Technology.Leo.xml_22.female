I feel better about myself, about how things fit .. and I can see the curve of my waist vs my hips REALLY coming back.   So not sure what's up with the digi scale, maybe it uses a different calculation for kgs vs lbs? I doubt it. . I mean it must be progress since that old scale, in the same spot, used to read 175 a few weeks/months ago. And my sister, who's the yardstick because she has a constant weight always tests it out and it reads the same for her ... so .. okay I AM 165lbs!  I think it's good progress to see that I've gone from 175lbs to 165lbs pretty quickly (i think). Imagine how fast it'll all go if I start working out properly? So 155lbs here I come in about 2 months!    I've been eating great, although at night I get the munchies. Nowadays I reach from some wheat crackers, instead of chips or chocolates .. so that's good. I only give myself one chocolate item a day .. which is either a snack size Snickers bar or a choc pudding handi-pack. And I only eat one - two meals a day, no dinner .. not really. Maybe that's why I've been snacking late at night? I'll have to watch that.   Btw I haven't posted in my weight loss blog for quite awhile, but since the last post .. my lingerie arrived in the post about a week ago. And I look AMAZING in it! Even the one-size fits all one. I didn't think I could look that good honestly. I think all women should get some sexy lingerie .. just for themselves because it's so wonderful to know that you CAN be sexy no matter what your weight is.
