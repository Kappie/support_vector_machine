At the beginning of our era, the Romans built a fort here, the remains of which still lie under the Domsquare today. The first Saint Martin’s church was built on this location in the 7th century.    From Roman to Gothic  The predecessor of the current church dates fromthe start of the 11th century. Some remnants of this Roman Saint Martin’s cathedral can be seen in the garden beside the Domtower. In 1253, a huge fire swept through the city and badly damaged the Roman cathedral. A new architectural style, Gothic, was chosen for rebuilding the church. Construction of this Gothic Saint Martin’s church began in 1254, when Bishop Hendrik van Vianden laid the first stone. Bit by bit, the originally Roman cathedral was replaced.    urlLink      The DOM in Utrecht     1254  - Bishop Hendrik van Vianden laid the first stone of the Gothic Cathedral.    1320  - Construction of the tower began.  1500  - Tower and church were connected.    1520  - Construction of the cathedral ended.    1 August 1674  - Utrecht was ravaged by a tornado.
