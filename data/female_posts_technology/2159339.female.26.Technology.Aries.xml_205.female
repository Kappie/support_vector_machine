In the muddy shitty wake of this most awfully agonizing and humbling experience, I want to better myself and make myself proud of me.   This weekend I finally attached a masonry bit to a drill, drilled two holes in my impenetrable concrete wall, pounded in anchors, and screwed in my IKEA lamp by my bed for bedtime reading. Hooray! I’d put off this task for months, hoping that I could cajole XX into doing it for me… but since he’s out of my life, I took off my pants, pulled my socks up high, and did it myself. I’m a hero! Now I can read at night! I haven’t read a real book in three months! I mean, why read when you could be having orgasms, right? Well, I will still be having orgasms, but instead of the subsequent pillow talk and hours of snuggling, I’ll cool down by feeding my mind instead of my id.  Other goals for myself: install curtains, take more walks, learn to sew, watch more movies.  Unfortunately, I’m not always this gleeful and pragmatic. Truthfully, the breakdown is 19% glee, 68% abject glumness, 6% ugly snotty crying and 7% contemplation on what I should do with the rest of my life. 86% of the time I still hope that XX will show up with an enormous bouquet of roses and utmost remorse. I imagine him groveling and admitting that indeed I’m a goddess and he was a fool to let me go. We’ll get back together with newfound mutual understanding, then live happily ever after, giving each other space and encouraging each other’s art. The other 14% of the time I wish him a miserable life replete with crippling STDs and an occupation as scourge of the earth, causing women to turn their faces in horror and babies to cry in fear and shame. I usually follow these two trains of fantasy by some logical thinking…   When XX and I were together, I was a mess. I neglected my music entirely and only made a few crafts here and there. I would be really proud of the stuff I managed to conceive and make, but XX didn’t support me. I’d talk to him excitedly about painting frames and gluing ribbons to felt, but he’d only ignore me and talk about himself some more. Even though my art is on a small homey level, he didn’t think what I did was important. He couldn’t see its importance to me because he was anxiously waiting for me to finish so he could resume talking about himself.  XX annoyed me a lot, but I’ll miss a lot of things about him too, like his ridiculous sense of humor, his tenderness, and his awesome sexual prowess. He had a small tool, but was very good with his hands and his tongue. He knew my body better than I did. He showed me a lot of things and made sex exciting again. But now that he’s gone, I can continue my interest without him. If the objective of sex is climax, then I will do just fine on my own.  I'm still very pathetic though: I check my phone all the time, hoping that maybe he’ll call to apologize and desperately beg my forgiveness, pledging his undying devotion to me; or maybe that he’ll slip a letter under my door with tear-stained ink and descriptions of his miserable life without me. I know there’s a better chance of popsicles in hell than these things happening, but until the heartache subsides, I'll still hope.  I took really good care of him, calling to check up on him and making sure he was content, but he said he didn’t like that. I should’ve known since he’d never call me when he was on the road: I’d always call him. And if I didn’t call, we wouldn’t talk at all. Maybe it would’ve worked if I played hard-to-get and read “The Rules.” But love isn’t a game to me. When I love, I love fully, exposing all my vulnerabilities and raw edges. And though XX couldn’t handle it, I have no regrets. I loved him in the only way I knew how, and he wanted out. I was never dishonest or “played” him. Maybe he wanted to be played and if so, it’s a good thing he quit, so he could find a more suitable partner: one with a poker face instead of one who showed him she was glad to see him; one who will bluff instead of one who said honestly, “I missed you.”
