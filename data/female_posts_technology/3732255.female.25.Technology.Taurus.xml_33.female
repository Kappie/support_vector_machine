Following the implosion of the genre-defining Grade (the band that many music writers and bands give credit to for the creation in 1995 of the screamo genre), its mastermind and creative leader Kyle Bishop was possessed to create something profoundly new and vibrant. He connected with Chris Gray (Zyon) and wall of sound axe-wielder Alan Nacinovic. The troupe was completed with a groove-laden rhythm section that can shatter the bones of the Gods - Derek Petrella on Drums and multi-instrumentalist Mike De Eyre on bass. They chose the The Black Maria as their band name, which comes from the slang term given to a police patrol wagon- “The Deliverer of Death”  The Black Maria head into the studio this July to record their debut album.
