My Uncle Steve Zana is one of the DJ pair that broadcasts the morning show on  urlLink Indiana 105 .  It's all because of  urlLink this picture , which travelled the Internet so fast yesterday that the folks in Valparaiso were stunned!  Uncle Steve interviewed me about how I heard of it, and how fast it went around the world.    Interesting experience, to be on the radio across the country at 6am...  Good morning, Indiana!
