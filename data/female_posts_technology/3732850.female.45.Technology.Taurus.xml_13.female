I don't have to rush to get some where or have to run here and there for my kids or husband. The fish don't bug you like the kids and husband. The fish don't know our names, so you don't hear "mom or "sweety". I like the relaxation that you get when you go fishing. It's nice to sit there and feel the breeze and the only sound you hear are the other people in the boats finding their spots to fish or the kids haveing fun on the tubes or water skiing.  I feel that nothing can bother me here and I can enjoy God's creation that man has not destroy for the society. I feel relaxed and don't worry about anything just to out fish my husband and son and sometimes thats hard with my son. We actually laugh more here too, they like seeing me squirm when they ask for the worms and leeches.
