Actors and Actresses are not typically highly educated people and their focus in life is on their appearance. Though they may be nice, they have a reputation for being good at the party scene and not generally the kind of people we want our children to grow up to be like. Think about this when Glenn Close (of whom I used to be a fan) or any other celebrity publically endorses a presidential candidate. They aren't the smartest kids on the block, but they sure do look good. Do you really want to take advice from THEM?
