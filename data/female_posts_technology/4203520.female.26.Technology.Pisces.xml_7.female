I was at the dentist talking with the receptionist about living situations. She is living with her husband and one of her four sisters. Her sister moved in for a month a year ago, the situation is tense to say the least. I mentioned that my  urlLink husband  and I live with another couple in a townhouse. She said "Gosh! That must be awkward". And I was struck once again by how completely not awkward the move and cohabitation has been so far.  Andrew and I have been married for 8 years and Eons and his wife have been together for about that long too. Eons and I were in the same class at college but only really got to know eachother after working at the same place after graduation.  I find it surprising, yet also somehow comforting that living with another couple, especially this particular couple has been so relaxed and fun and funny. It's been nice to have a little change in routine, to see how other people live their lives on a slightly more personal scale than friends, even close friends normally get to see.
