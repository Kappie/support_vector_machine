I'm grateful for my wonderful husband, whose patience runs as deep as an ocean and whose love for me he demonstrates in many different ways.  I hope to be always the good and appreciative wife you deserve.  I'm grateful for my Mom and Dad.  I can't believe you two are about to celebrate your 25th Wedding Anniversary!  Let's go to San Antonio or San Marcos! hehehehe..  I'm grateful for my wonderful brother, Jedd, who I wish wouldn't grow up so fast.  I can still remember changing his diapers and him being short enough to hug my leg standing up and now we wear the same size shoes!  I'm grateful for Rhy, who's always been my partner in crime.  We have so many inside jokes, it could fill a hummer.  And lastly, I'm grateful for the weekends.  Those two days when we're allowed to breathe, pause, play, and reflect.    Have a wonderful weekend everybody!
