You don't "know it" every living moment, every time you meet or kiss. Sometimes it feels like routine. Feels like inertia. Sometimes you doubt. But certain moments... Certain moments are so real, so deep, so true - and these moments cement that feeling in you - and then you know. And those certain moments carry you through the banalities of the day to day life and the routine, and the ups and downs and turmoils.   I had one of such fleeting moments today. Nothing in particular happened. But I had one of these moments where I looked at my husband, and I felt my heart swell so large and so full, and I just knew he is my soulmate and there is no one on earth I would rather be with.And I fell in love all over again - with his kindness, and sense of humour, and wit. And I felt blessed to have found him, and for an instant thanked god for my luck.   That moment is over, my heart is back to it's original size, and my day continued on - just as usual. But I felt obliged to commemorate this in writing, so that one day, when temptations rise, or when a battle ensues, I can read back on this and remember - I know. I do. I love.
