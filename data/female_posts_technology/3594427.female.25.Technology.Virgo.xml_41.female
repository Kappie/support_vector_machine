The Head of IT used to work for my current company. He found out I was going to leave, so he asked me to submit my resume to him ASAP. Nothing's final at this point, but he's very interested in acquiring my services. Now I am confused because I don't know whether to go home to the Philippines or if I should just stick it out here in SG. We might start initial discussions soon if he likes my resume well enough.  Pros: It's contractual work for only 1-2 years. Plus, I get exposed to the client's environment. For the last 4 years, I've always been exposed to this world from the vendor side.  Cons: Do I really want to stay in the Investment industry?      Sigh! I was really looking forward to going home.
