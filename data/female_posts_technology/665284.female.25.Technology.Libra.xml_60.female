That was what was so scary.  - Richi Tozier -    I don't understand this all.  I don't understand any of this.  Why does a story have to be socio-anything?  Politics...culture...history...aren't those natural ingredients in any story, if it's told well?  I mean...can't you guys just let a story be a story?  - Bill Denbrough -    ...on those days Ben would sometimes look sideways at Beverly, stealing her face, and his heart would both hurt desperately and somehow grow brighter at the same time  If a hole leading into the underworld had opened before him at that very moment,  Ben would have dropped into it without a sound...or perhaps with the faintest murmur of gratitude.
