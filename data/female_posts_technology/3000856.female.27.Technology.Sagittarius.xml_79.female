Have you ever felt pretty much set in your ways and someone or something comes along and tries to change it or maybe just confuses you and how you are feeling? That is what happened to me.  I have been seeing someone (nothing serious) we have hung out a few times and talk on the phone all the time. Anyway, he unloaded a lot on me last night. I mean A LOT! I felt very uncomfortable. I really don't know much about him at all. Things were said about future, marriage, kids.....WHAT? OMG! The thing is, I am set in my ways and what I want, and marriage and kids are not one of them. That might sound bad, but that is how I feel.  My son is all I want and need and I just don't think I am capable of loving someone so much that I would spend the rest of my life w/ them. That is a really long time. Talk about pressure. I don't think I can love someone at that capacity period! Man I sound like a bitch right now.  This is why I am still single and will probably remain so for the rest of my life at this rate! My luck has always been that there are like 15 guys waiting for me to date them and the ones I am interested in don't even know I am alive! That is no big deal, really. Why can't I ever be on the same page as everyone else?  I am either a chapter ahead or in a different book completely! What am I gonna do? Take it one day at a time. That is all I can do, I don't want to stress about every fucking detail in my life.  That is why I am turning into a complete lunatic these days. NO JOKE! I don't know how a lot of people are putting up w/ me these days. I sure as hell would not put up w/ me that is for sure. LOL
