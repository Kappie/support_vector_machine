Would they weep in my wake and after I’m buried, would they still continue to? Maybe some will and some wont. I don’t know. Life goes on. I’m not expecting them to weep for the rest of their lives. They’ve got their own living to do. Will I be remembered? How will I be remembered? Have I done things that are significant enough to touch their lives?  I think I’ve tried to live my life fairly the way I can. I think I’ve helped people and tried to be an existentialist. I’m not really sure if I’ve done the best that I could because sometimes, I’m so jaded and consumed by self-loathing. But since I’m a contradiction, I bounce back and look on the brighter side of things. I mean what else could I do? I don’t want to be dark and pessimistic all the time. I find it such a drag when I come across people like that. I can’t say that I’m pretty little miss sunshine. Hell no. But I’m not a dark person either. Well, I can’t really understand myself sometimes. So when I die, are there people who have actually understood me? It doesn’t matter. No point to it. I’m just trying to live life the only way I know how.
