God, I miss the days when I had the luxury of time to just walk around aimlessly in  Megamall.  2) Go to Boracay finally. I've never been a beach person but I know my friends would like to go, so maybe I'll give it a shot.  3) Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep.  4) Chase my cats around the house all day. They hate being hugged, but I don't care! I miss them so much every single day.  5) Find myself a date.  6) If I had the extra cash, I'd probably go to Venice. I was supposed to go this April but my boss didn't approve my leave. (What's new?)  7) Climb a mountain again.  8) Go on a retreat for a week.  9) Watch all the art film DVD's we have in Manila that I haven't seen.  10) Do some spring cleaning.
