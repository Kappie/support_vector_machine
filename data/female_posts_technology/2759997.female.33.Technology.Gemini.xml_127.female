This being my first Frontier experience, I was looking forward to seeing how it compares to  urlLink Southwest  (no contest) and also thrilled to have an affordable non-stop option to Denver.  First off, Frontier has seat assignments (big win).  Second, they allow you to pay $5 and watch any of 24 channels of live TV (including Food Network) via  urlLink DirectTV .  And they serve  urlLink decent   urlLink beer .  I'm not impressed with the  urlLink animals on the planes , but I found out that one of their major ad campaigns centers around the animals talking to each other while sitting at the gate.  Still don't think much of it (in fact probably less) - Southwest's cleverly decorated regional planes win out, hands down.  As does their magazine.  In fact, I quickly flipped through Frontier's rag and wrote it off (read: no crossword).  And when I read in the  urlLink Sunday paper  that it was a new product of their ad agency and was "worth" $8 a month as a high-end coffee table magazine, I was more than a little skeptical.  So, fly Frontier if you can.  Row 9 is exit row, for those who want some leg room.  And have a Foster's or a Newcastle and pay the $5 for TV, even if only to ensure that the person next to you won't speak to you during the flight.
