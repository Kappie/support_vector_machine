This small piece of device is an amazing thing.Thanks to my mentor jose (HP - Fargo) who taught me so much about it much to his enormous knowledge.   The more popular ones on the stall are the ipaq 4150,4350 (the latest) or the dell axim series . I personally love the hp 4355 .If you are looking for a small handy piece of art then this is it!
