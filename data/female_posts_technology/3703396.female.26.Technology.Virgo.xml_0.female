After coming home from the dentist (I'd rather move to Iraq, as those of you who know me can figure) I was already in a petrified state.  I was cranky because I could not eat (couldn't feel my lips) and proceeded to add chlorine to the pool, which makes me sneeze like crazy.  When I turned back the cover there was a HUGE dead cockroach in the pool!  GROSS!  Returning to my office after the chlorine, I realized Olly dumped the trash and scattered it all over the room, eating all the plastic in the process.  I cleaned it all up and went into the bathroom, at which time the wooden cupboard door jumped out in front of me and scraped my knee all up.  As I screamed in pain and cursed and swore, I went to the other bathroom for some bactine and stepped in kitty puke on the way.  Olly had thrown up in the hallway after eating all the plastic.  As if all this wasn't bad enough, I went to find the carpet cleaner to see that there wasn't any left.  I tried to find something to clean the carpet and came across another cleaner, which I grabbed and headed back to the hallway to clean the kitty barf.  Stubbing my toe on the couch, I couldn't take it anymore!!!    To top everything off, I have a 4:30 appointment to get measured at the gym that I joined.  This is my first session with my personal trainer, Brandon.  After all that has happened, the least enjoyable evening I could have would include having my fat content documented and my flexibility criticized.  I hope Brandon is nice to me!  This is one of the worst days I've had in a really long time.
