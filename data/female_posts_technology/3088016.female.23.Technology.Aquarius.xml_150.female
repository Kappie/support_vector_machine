On Saturday after scuba, I was ravenous.  Slug came over to go with me to Tacqueria la Tapetia (which is not as good now that they’re in the fancy new digs).  Then he was stuck running errands with me all day – back over to my place to take my car in to get inspected and the oil changed then back over to the scuba store to get the tanks refilled and for me to get a skin suit, then back over to pick up my car, then back over to Academy and the dollar store, the back to pick up a prescription.  We didn’t plan well, so ½ the stuff was by me and the other ½ was in the Westheimer/Shephard area.  Anyway – the point of all this is that running errands is more bearable when someone else is along.   Especially when it’s a slug boy that knows he’s about to have a ton of salt poured on top of him.   I don’t usually do relationships.  So I figure slug boy is a good practice relationship until the real guy comes along.
