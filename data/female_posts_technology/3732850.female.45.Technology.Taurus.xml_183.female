They're listening for weaknesses in logic to leap on, points they can distort to make the other look bad. We all do this when we're angry." In her essay "The Triumph of the Yell"  I feel this paragraph especially relates to my life. The biggest fights Tim and I had were always over money. One night we were discussing the disbursements of the money and where it needs to go, when I reminded him the importance of dates. This sparked a fude.
