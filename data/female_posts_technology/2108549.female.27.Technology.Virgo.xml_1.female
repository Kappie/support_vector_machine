For example "Per our chat last night", "Hi", "Job leads", etc.  I got one this afternoon from a site that supposedly someone has information about available.  But I can't find out what the information is unless I pay for it.  Now I ask you, if the information were valid, which I doubt this is, wouldn't I know it already?  If this information were about me and truthful, wouldn't I, being me, know what it says?  Why would I need to pay for it? And to make it more obscure, the information is only listed by an email address I use for resumes.  Not by name, or a more often used email but by one used for job hunting.    Just another example of the many. many scams on the net.  So yeah, I am a tad irked by it.    In other areas, work is still good.  Life is still good.  45 minutes til the weekend starts!
