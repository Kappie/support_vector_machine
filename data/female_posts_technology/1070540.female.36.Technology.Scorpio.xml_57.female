I feel my husband must think I am gross or something,  over the last few weeks, he has started leaving the house at night, like he did when he had found someone else.  If he does not leave then he stays up and not in bed with me. I know he works strange hours and is not tired when I am,  but he normally loves sex,  he doesnt even seem interested in that.  Twice this week he has not come to bed or made love to me, and when he has lately he has turned the lights out and tv off, i guess so he doesnt have to look at me.  Damn it, I feel as if my husband doesnt want me or doesnt like what I look like.  I am trying real hard to loose weight and have started excersing all the time.  I pray that he notices the difference when it starts to show,  I miss him deeply.  I am so depressed and my self esteem is so low....I just want to please my husband
