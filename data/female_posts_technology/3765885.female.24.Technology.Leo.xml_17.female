Really hope the holiday will go well... the beach... the sand... the water... the sun... a relaxing holiday... 2 more weeks and OFF I GO! wee!!! this is really exciting... hope this excitment is enuff to push me on for another 2 weeks.... arggg work is getting really frustrating... getting pushed and pushed to close work units... yes... this is working life... deadlines everyday... stress everyday... How I wish I can be back in school... at least I still have a choice to skip some classes when I am feeling real down... now... no matter how sucky life is... work goes on... and work only makes things worse... much worse...  Maybe I need a change in environment... some other job which allows me to do more then just programming... some other job which gives me more exposure... more growth...  Too cooped up in this current one... maybe a break will do some good... 2 more weeks... to go... I will go on....
