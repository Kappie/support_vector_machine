There is a saw and I get to help cut down our christmas tree. We drive around and mom and i are in back. Dad dumps us out in the snow. We are laughing and having fun. My sister is helping my dad drive. We spot the tree we want forchristmas. My dad starts to cut it down. This is at the ESPE Tree Farm in Wannaska. We live twelve miles from there. We now head back to the cabin to pay for our tree. Mrs. Espe invites us in for her hot chocolate and homemade cookies. We enjoy them and I ask to take some cookies home. There are other people to visit with. We load our tree and head home. Dad finishes trimming the tree while mom finds the stand for the tree. My sister and I help mom find the decorations. We are all tired but too excited so dad brings in the tree and we string the lights on first. We continue to decorate and I want to string popcorn. I don't finish stringing the popcorn that night. Mom is helping me. Even though we finish with the decorations being put on the tree, my mom helps me the next day to get the popcorn string done and we somehow manage to make it look nice and add it to our. We went to my Sunday School program and when we got home we took turns taking pictures in front of the tree. I wonder which presents are mine? Every year we take turns putting the angel on top of the tree. My mom told me once she watches over us while we sleep. We have our own special day for opening presents before we go to granpa and grandma's house. One year I asked santa for a furby but I didn't get one. I was disappointed but mom said that santa had too many kids asking for the same thing and his elves couldn't keep up. Later, in april for my birthday I got my furby. I had lots of fun and then I ended up with another one from a friend who had given one to me. It was fun to teach them how to talk. One was the color blue and the other was light blue. Now I've outgrown them and gave them to my sister.
