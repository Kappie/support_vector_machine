The first to ask, what comes along with that? Well, I realize that we are all looking for some sort of bargain along the way... in one form or another.  And "it never hurts to ask"... but I bet that you know (as of course, do I) at least one person that is just pushing it to the limit... and of course... killing some opportunities as well for you.  (Because the "benefits" have  been abused...)
