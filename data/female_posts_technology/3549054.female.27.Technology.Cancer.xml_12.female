ABOUT THE MUSES The Nine Muses are the Greek goddesses of inspiration, learning, the arts, and culture. According to Hesiod's Theogony, Zeus lay with Mnemosyne ("Memory") for nine days, and she gave birth to the Muses, who rejoice in their bright dancing places on Mount Helicon -- "nine voices united in one song." Their companions are the Graces and Desire, and their leader is Apollo, the god of music and harmony.  ....  I am not sure now how far the title suits the blog. Now, time to rename this....  And for all those people who have been going over this blog, can u please suggest????
