Sears would charge a pretty penny to send a repairman over here, and I feel confident that they would not hesitate to charge more than once in this saga.  So that's a victory in itself.  Second, I'm proud of myself and my persistence in pursuing the repair project through all these many calls.  It's annoying but I'm not letting it stop me.  Third, I've discovered that I really miss my treadmill.  I miss being able to walk after work each day.  Sure, I could walk outside.  Of course, it's presently 90 degrees out there.  And that's been the temperature every day lately.  So I *could* walk outside but I'd get a better walk on the treadmill.  Fourth, in an effort not to be stalled in my fitness goals I persuaded my partner to join the local rec center with me.  I think she's shocked that I would want to do that, since I've never been very athletic.  The thing is, I know that if I'm to become healthy I have to become more active.  And the local rec center offers a lot of options for that.  Plus it's reasonably priced and what we pay helps support the center for everyone.  And finally, I got creative today and looked into my college catalog.  We live very near a community college campus and I've been taking classes there for a couple of years.  It turns out that they have a fitness center on campus.  For the cost of one credit hour I can use the facility from August 23 through December 12, and taking a Physical Education class includes what amounts to guidance by a physical trainer!   So GO ME!!
