     
      Hitting Flannery's tonight for some food and drinks w/ a friend of mine that doesn't work at JWI anymore. Anyone is welcome to join us after 8p. Give a ring if you want to come down and don't see us there. We might hit Taylor's for a bit if the waitress at Flannery's starts giving us the "get outta here" look.
