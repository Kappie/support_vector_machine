I drove to school.. then my dad drove back... My dog barked "bye bye" to me... so cute.. I love 'him' - Lucky!! Well, have finished my stuff at work... that is -- updated the school web page info... then play online games (What game? Neopets of course!) Got free gift today at work... given by my colleague... he said was given by 'big fat pig' After work, go for tuition... PSLE student!!! Very important year! Got SMS message from school P while I was teaching... (What else could that be? Work loh!) Just gave up in doing the PSLE story sums from other primary schools... tired of using my brain... Wow almost 11.30pm.. want to sleep loh!!! ZZZZzzzZZZzzzZZZzzzzz.. sweet dreams...... (If got any typo errors, please forgive... coz din wear specs and din on the lights... Heee :))
