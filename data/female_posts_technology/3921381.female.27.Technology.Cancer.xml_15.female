NEVER PAY OUT OF POCKET EITHER.  it took me almost 1 hrs to do paperwork and crap of who is paying. finally, we got it all settled. my friends insurance will cover my expenses and then they insurance will go after the other guy.  damn.. i'm feeling headaches. need.....................rest................................
