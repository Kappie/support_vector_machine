I blindly take risks on music, enduring hours of mediocre CDs and horrible opening bands, hoping for that awesome feeling of secret discovery.

I have that feeling again. I almost want to keep it to myself. They're wonderful and poppy with traces of the Beatles. (Two songs specifically: the chimey guitar in "Julia" is evoked in one song, and the brassy guitar tone in the intro riff of "Something" is used in another. They're also like The Beatles because they're strong singers.) But they're edgier than the Beatles. They're more atmospheric and less annoying. They remind me of the Britpop I listened to in high school mixed with that very-now, swaggery NYC sound. Ah sweet soaring melodies, ah enchanting pop hooks! I'm in heaven or love or both. I almost want to keep it a secret because I don't want to share... But here goes. They are...
