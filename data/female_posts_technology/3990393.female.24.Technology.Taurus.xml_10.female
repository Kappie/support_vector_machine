God is really so good..He keeps on giving us many blessings and guiding us all the way that’s why i’m really very thankful to Him.  before, i used to complain of problems that come my way or things that i can’t or don’t have but now i learned to be more thankful of what i have and of what i am. i learned to accept that problems are just trials or obstacles i need to surpass in order to be more worthy and deserving of the good things that are about to come.  i must admit that i was such an insecure person during my younger years..i used to think that i was such a nobody (maybe it was the way that i was raised) and this feeling led me to become a pleaser coz i want people to appreciate me and the things i can do.  but ever since i met my honey, those insecurities slowly disappeared coz finally i got this one person who completely appreciates me and all my flaws.  =)
