He had gorgeous eyes - at least I think he did. Who can tell through all that smoke. ;)  Something that sparks my curiosity....is  urlLink www.shareyourexperiences.com . Evidently a few people are trying to scope out information about me. They know my e-mail address and that's how they are posting on that site to find out details about me. It costs too much to join, so I haven't been able to do much investigatin. And I'm wondering if it's just a spam type lure. If anyone knows anything about this site, I'd love to hear some details about it. Or if you know who is trying to scope me out, I'd love to hear about that too!!   Something that tempts me....is my roomie stretched out on the couch watching a movie. Especially after we've eaten a big meal. I want to go over there and stretch out next to him. What is it about the comfort of just laying on the couch next to someone? Maybe it's just that. The comfort. I like the activity I'm bringing into my life. I just wish I had more of the lounging on the couch with someone going on in my life.  Something that gives me hope...is having a crush on someone that complimented me yesterday. Well call him Mr. S. He's an adorable guy who works for another department. We were in a class together earlier this year. He's got a Chicago accent, sparkling blue eyes, a warm smile, and a very laid back personality. He works in a different building than I do, and I've seen him maybe 3 times since we finished class. We were in a meeting together yesterday afternoon. We were chatting together with a co-worker of mine. I managed to invite him to a party she hasn't even scheduled yet! :o) He didsay he likedmy hair. So here's to hoping there is some interest and a potential date in there somewhere. I'm tempted to just be forward and call him at home. How do men feel about women asking them out anyway!?!?!  There is lots of work to be done today. I'm still in sleep recovery mode after my lack of zzz's this weekend. May have to get some coffee.
