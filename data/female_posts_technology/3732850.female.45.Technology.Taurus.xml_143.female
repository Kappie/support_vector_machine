I loved the say that he pointed out the multiple extra fluff words and expressions that we use in our english language everyday and we are now accustom to hearing. We don't even think twice when the weather man states, "At the present time we are experiencing precipitation." That is just the way they talk and we take their language as a part of them. Never have I heard a professional weather man state, "It's raining" and leave it at that. Is the jargon really what makes these people professionals in so many peoples minds?
