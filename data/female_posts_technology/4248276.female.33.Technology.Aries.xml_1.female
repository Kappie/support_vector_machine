Two large pizza's. Of course they are very nice and thankful and tell him they will try and get our electric on by tonight but there are two breaks in the lines they can't find. Oh well it was a nice gesture right...more like a bribe to me. :)  Ate two hot dogs from 7-11 for lunch. Not sitting to well I have to admit. I do not know why I torcher myself the way I do. I knew before I ate them it was going to hurt.
