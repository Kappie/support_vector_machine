I think normal people do more hobby-stuff in the winter, but I've never claimed to be normal.   Running keeps my stress-levels down, makes me healthier, and keeps me from getting too chubby.  Blogging gets all of this useless crap that you're reading out of my head.  Crocheting lets me watch all the TV and movies I want without feeling lazy.  French is a language I've been learning on and off for years.  Aside from the 45mins a day they tried to teach us in school, I've done a year immersion in junior high (at an English school) and have taken evening classes.   One of my French co-workers is giving some instruction one lunch hour a week and I'm listening to audio lessons everyday and studying.  I'm also going to start watching some French TV.
