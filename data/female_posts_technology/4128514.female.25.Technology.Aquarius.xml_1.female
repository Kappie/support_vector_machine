And I don't mean just a good partner in a relationship. Even being a good friend goes underapprciated these days. I got a voicemail from a guy I had been involved with earlier in the year, we'll call him the "crazy one". We had been dating off and on for about 3 months or so. And the entire time, I knew  something  wasn't right but could never really put my finger on it. He was one of those very charming guys, was really fun to be around (at first glance anyway). But he had a habit of not returning my calls, and being unavailable at "normal" hours. On top of that, he starting having trouble with the law. Now, I'm a "ride or die chick"; I'll stick by a good man going through a hard time; hell, I would want the same from a friend or mate or whatever. But the combination of his "unavailabilty", plus his accumulation trouble, and his lack of attention AND his evolving negative attitude eventually pushed me away. So it's now been about 3 months and every 2 weeks, religously, he calls me. I have long since stopped answering my phone when he calls because our separation wasn't exactly "pretty". Every message is the same: " I miss you, I want to see you, Lets take the kids out, Lets go eat". it's amazing to me the things that you are offered when you don;t give aperson any attention. I couldn't get the time of day from him when we were involved...oh but  NOW ... now you know who I am, and want to come around. Not happenin' buddy...take your negativity elsewhere.  And I say this not, while admitting that I have been NOT perfect in this area myself. I just broke my neck myself last night to see a very good friend of mine (we'll call him Babyface) who is going back to school this weekend. He and I were involved for a good part of last year, although completely long distance. Our realtionship kinda died out towards the end of the year, but we're still real cool. Anyway, once I moved back here, I was happy to know that in the summer we would get to kick it. He came home in mid-May and we hung out twice. And I haven't seen him since. And that is of my own fault, I confess. I wasn't really calling him, hadn't really invited him over and wasn't really returning his calls...I know I'm a damn hypocrite. I ran into him at D&B two Fridays ago and he told me when he was going back to school and I just went crazy.  Now look who's calling who trying to get in some last minute QT...lol  We kicked it last Friday and last night and said our lil goodbyes. I'll miss him and I know that I won't slack on our time with each again. I have so few men around me that I can call real "friends" that I know have to appreciate them more. Especially since out of the 5 men that I do call "friend" only one live here in Atl right now.
