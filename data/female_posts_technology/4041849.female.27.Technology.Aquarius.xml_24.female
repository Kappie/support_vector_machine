My allies are the ones wearing crosses or American flags. The people sporting shirts emblazened with the "F-word" are my opponents. Also, as always, the pretty girls and cops are on my side, most of them barely able to conceal their eye-rolling.   so, that's the first paragraph... directly from her site: anncoulter.com    this is another favorite of mine, again lifted directly from her site:   As for the pretty girls, I can only guess that it's because liberal boys never try to make a move on you without the UN Security Council's approval. Plus, it's no fun riding around in those dinky little hybrid cars. My pretty-girl allies stick out like a sore thumb amongst the corn-fed, no make-up, natural fiber, no-bra needing, sandal-wearing, hirsute, somewhat fragrant hippie chick pie wagons they call "women" at the Democratic National Convention.   i shit you not. she wrote this for a newspaper... what was she thinking?       i can't believe that any rational adult would actually write these things... so i'm guessing either she doesn't really believe it and she's doing it for the attention... or she's crazy... i'm sorry... but, this woman seriously, seriously needs to get her meds upped. maybe she can call rush limbaugh for a referral. :P
