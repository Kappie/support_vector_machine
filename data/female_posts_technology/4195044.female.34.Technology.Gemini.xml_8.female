There is reason in fact to celebrate... if not because of this crazed technology, Dutchman and I wouldn't have crossed our paths! He would forever stay in the flatlands, maybe end up being a cheesehead ( kaaskop ) bachelor all his life, while I... will be in someone else's arms in God knows where land. Blech! Me thinking that gives me an icky feeling. I guess that is what real   "  LOVE"   can do, exorcize you! Haha!  Let's see... I have several  Forums  that I am a member of. A travel forum, a Fil-West forum (couple of them), Bisaya forum, Government forum, European Expat forum, Philippine forum, International forum.... what else? Oh yeah I forgot, the forever friendly networking   urlLink Friendster   and this addictive   urlLink Blogger  . To add, I have   urlLink YM   and still contemplating of installing   urlLink ICQ   in this new laptop. I still have   urlLink mIRC   but I rarely go there.  Albeit, having not degenerated myself into a full-blown Internet Consumer, I am by huge chance prepared to join the pack. Who knows when?  Je weet van nooit!  To consummate this pledge would be the day that I loose human adroitness in socializing, even if I have to only go to  urlLink  Albert Heijn  ,  urlLink  Nettorama   or  urlLink  ALDI  . I know they are poor choices of social forms but hey, that's as realistic as can be! SOBER...  Oh well, I book my tickets online too.  urlLink  KLM   has flying colors on my notes with  Online Booking  and  Kiosk Check-Ins...  but I have no freaking idea why they behave like PAL? -Plane Always late!- Duh, not  urlLink  Philippine Airlines  , boohoo! Teehee!  Then we got for sure the money and life savers - Online Banking in NL. Fantastic!  urlLink  ABN Amro   ( De bank ) does the trick.  urlLink  Spaarbeleg   quite so too... absolute convenience is all I can say.  What's next? .... ......... ..  Maybe nothing yet, hehe. I am still thinking. I think sandman caught me....
