I will be sharing these posts with you on the upcoming posts.  I hope that you will enjoy and share the excitement that I felt as I embarked upon this new journey! :))    Wow!  What a rollercoaster ride I've been on during the last few days -- emotions encircling and keeping me from being as organized as I should be.  On Friday, I had off to go to San Antonio, but I actually didn't get to leave until Saturday morning (had to get my camera  contacts from the office, oil changed in my car, log in new assignments to a spreadsheet, etc., etc).  Saturday morning was more of the same centering around from my garage door not closing  my pants tearing by catching on the pitch of the doorway.  It was really comical that I even got out of The Woodlands area at all!! When I finally made it to San Antonio!!
