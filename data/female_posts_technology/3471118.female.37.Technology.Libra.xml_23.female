It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away. 15 Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts. 16 But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.   Refers back to the Exodus verses from a day or so back.  The difference is that for Moses and the old covenant with God, the radiance faded so he covered his face so no one would see it.  With the new covenant with Jesus, the radiance does not fade, so the veil is not needed.  So when you become a Christian, that veil is taken away, so everyone can see the radiance that shines through you because of God.  At least, I think that's how I understand things, from the learning Bible.
