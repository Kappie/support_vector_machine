The landlord screwed some things up and it might be a few weeks before those things can be installed.  I got moved in on Saturday and things went well.  I spent most of yesterday unpacking boxes and moving things around and getting things put away. Amazing how much more gets done when I can't plop in front of the tv or stay online all day!   Freedom and the girls are adjusting, I'm adjusting and while Saturday was hard, I am back to loving living alone.  The first night there was weird.  I think I forgot how to be alone like that but last night was great.  I have a long list of things that need to be fixed but I think everything is going to turn out ok.  I met my new neighbors and they seem really nice so I think that's going to be fun.  He's a chef and invited me to come to dinner with him and his girlfriend one night.  They seem really nice and we're together in the whole no communication problems with the landlord.    So I am here, I'm just not real available right now.  If you have my cell phone and need me, call that.  I check the new phone message center now and then but not with any regularity.
