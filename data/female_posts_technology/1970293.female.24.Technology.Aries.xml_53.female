Numbered at least four to one, the soldiers charged on with hope still left in their beating hearts.  And yet they knew they might not survive this battle but they still had to go on to protect their lands, families, and honor.  There was no hope for these soldiers to come out unscathed.  Most will die and some might survive to continue the fight for another day.  Still they rumbled across the brown field, their swords, lances, maces raised and their sheilds held high.  Shining armor flashed in the waning sun as if a warning to their foes that they won't give up.  The sun hid behind the clouds as if afraid to witness such a extraordinary event happening below.  Drums echo across the plains from both sides creating a thundering effect.    The soldiers crashed into the main horde of foes sweeping through the middle into the center of the fray.  Slowly a gulf of soldiers brutally cut, slashed their way through towards the castle, standing high at the other end of the field.  With their prize so close and yet so far away as the swarm of orcs kept coming.  There was too many to kill or even hold back for very long.  The King blew his horn to return the soldiers to him to regroup for a final stand.   The horn blasted to the four corners of the battle.  Soldiers vainly fought to return to their soverienty's side.  The King blew his horn again and again.  Finally he blew and led a new charge towards the castle killing orcs left and right.    A new thunder raged across the battle.  Lightening lit up the sky.  Thunder crashed again and again.  Finally rain poured down cleaning the earth.  Blood swirled in puddles of water before soaking into the earth.  The horses slipped under the weight of their riders in the mud and the muck.    All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003
