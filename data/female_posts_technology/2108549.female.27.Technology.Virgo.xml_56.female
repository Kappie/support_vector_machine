I am referring to the *have nots* that literally have nothing but what they push in a shopping cart or carry in a bag.  They live on the streets of every city of every state in this country.    While a man in a BMW fiddling with his laptop, talking on a cell phone fights with his wife about what house they should purchase next, the man on the corner wonders when he will get to eat again.  A lot of people ignore them, for blindness is easier than caring.  It is easier to pretend they do not exist, than to admit "that could be me".  We're all guilty of it. Everyone has done it.  More often than not I haven't given to the man or woman holding the sign because I am greedy and cannot police the way they are going to spend my spare change.   What if though, every one of the people in the *have* group made one bag lunch every day and gave it to a *have not*.  Something simple, a sandwich, a juice box, some fruit and some chips.  The kind of lunch we resented getting when we were 13 because they weren't cool.  Its inexpensive to do, takes very little time to make and even less time to give away.  Wouldn't then there be a little less of the *have nots*?  Its hard to make a good impression for a job interview when you haven't eaten in 3 days.  Its hard to not consider shoplifting that sandwich if its the only prospect of food.  Sure, some are homeless by choice.  A lot aren't though. Through any series of decisions they made, they are living on a street with nothing.  I know I could have easily been there.    Last year it was a serious possibility.  It might not have been long term and I am sure any one of my friends and family would have let me stayed with them but not everyone has those options.   No single person can feed everyone.  But every single person can feed just one.
