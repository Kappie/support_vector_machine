I’m such a dumb*ss… well the poor dog needed to go pee desperately ..and I refused to open her cage.. I mean this dog is huge.. I usually don’t fear dogs.. but this one is a monster… before long G Anti’s kid came down and let the dog out.. I got ready and decided to go to work.. I was half way there when I noticed I didn’t have my seat belt on.. I’m usually anal when it comes to that stuff… I will not drive until everyone has their seat belts on and today …well I forgot to wear mine.. I have no idea where my head is today… I hope god’s watching over me…cuz today I’m a lost cause…
