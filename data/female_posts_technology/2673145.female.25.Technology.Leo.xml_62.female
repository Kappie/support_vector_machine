A very enjoyable movie with witty dialogues, a mature/adult comedy show that I believe you'll enjoy it. ;) [And Keanu was gorgeous!!]  There's a scene when Diane was telling her daughter the pain of falling in love. And her daugther said, "That's what I've been telling you, to protect yourself." (not in actual words)   The mum said, sobbing "You mean you have been living that way?"   ...Fast Forward>>   The daughter said, "I never know how love feels." "You have to let someone in. Even though it hurts, I had the time of my life."  It was touching the way the scene was played. Not to mention the words were what I have said and been told.   I have said to many friends who have got heart broken that one should always protect one's heart. My sister told me that I have to open up, let someone in, experience love even thou it might hurt. The sweetness will linger, anger will eventually subside, the wound on the heart will heal, the pain you'll remember. This is life. If you haven't experience falling in love, you haven't lived.   So Charbel was right in my previous entry. Knowing that chocolate will make me fat, will I still eat it?
