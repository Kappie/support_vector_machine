We were seated in a private booth and I looked around at our gorgeous surroundings, at us, and had to concede. Sure, we both find our jobs tedious and joyless and the base of our depressions, but our stupid jobs paid for our fabulous dinner of pate, oignon (onion) soup, truite (trout), and desserts of bread pudding (no raisins, thankfully) and creme brulee. Oh, our feast was sumptuous and rich and decadent. Oh, how high our main course was artfully piled. Oh, how the red wine was expensive. But how I didn't want to be anywhere else. Good food, good friends, and good health is all a girl really needs.   We will cry when we get our credit card bills, but for now, we will grin wickedly.
