Lots of laughs and kisses there!  Worked in the garden a bit and just in general kept to myself. My feelings have been hurt by a couple people and I know when it is more than one person, there is something wrong with me.  Regardless, they are still hurt and I am licking my wounds and trying to analyze myself.    Yeah... Shannon wrapped up in her own head is a muchly scary thought.
