And really it's supposed to be a daily sort of entry like a real diary.  Sadly, I am old enough to remember the 'real diaries', you know, the ones you hold in your hand and write in with a pen, or a pencil.   I loved those diaries, the ones with the lock.  Although, really, what are you writing that needs a lock? Unless you're planning to overthrow the government, or are a terrorist, or a potential mass murderer.  I always felt the lock was unnecessary.  Well, for the things I would write anyway, which really only consisted of 'Today I went to school' or 'I have to lose weight'.  One of my favourite cartoons was one of Robotman - which I have no idea if it's printed anywhere anymore (it was about a robot, funnily enough, with very human traits).  The first cartoon frame was him sitting at a desk with a diary open on the desk.  The second frame was him writing 'Dear Diary', the third frame was him writing 'Today I bought a diary'.  This kind of sums my life in terms of writing any sort of daily account.  But I digress.  Well, LisaMisa's part-ay has been had and was quite tremendous, as it always is. Although the whole 'disparate groups' thing still happened. I guess you can't force people to mingle can you?   I felt though I was running a bit of a party obstacle race, racing from group to group and frantically chatting, in between heating up the party food and wanting to hide in the toilet, and then really wanting to spend the whole time gazing into the eyes of the boy on whom I have a crush.  Which was the whole point of inviting the whole department at work, when really I only wanted him to come along, but thought that might be perceived to be slightly creepy.  In the end I hardly spoke to him at all.  Which is just as well, as I wouldn't have had anything to say.  Who does those sort of things? How pathetic and weird.  Me, that's who does them. Mrs Passive Aggressive, thinking that people might get the hint, but they never do. Hopeless.  Anyway, apparently the caramelised red onion and feta tarts came out a treat, the sausage rolls were apparently quite good and everyone ate the dodgy cold rolls.  Don't get me wrong, I'm happy that people ate stuff but it would have been nice been to try one.    LisaMisa is Mrs Party Queen, really. She's amazing. Everyone loved the candles lining the driveway, the tents, the band. She's a good shindig thrower.  Even though it makes us very tired, in the end, it's all good.   I guess this is not the blog either to dwell on hideous work-land, where the Big Hand Of Retrenchment once again descended on us and resulted in the loss of two co-workers, two very talented boys, without who's knowledge and skills are going to result in us being screwed, basically. Not to mention, making morale non existent and leaving us feeling like a bunch of miserable lost children wandering around a forest of uncertainty.    Fuck corporate America, that's all I have to say.
