  urlLink   How to Cook Everything: Simple Recipes for Great Food   I have this great kitchen all to myself, so now all I need for my journey to culinary greatness is a cookbook.  Also I'm kind of a fanatic recipe-follower, so this one sounds great in that it covers the basics that everyone supposedly knows but really no one does, like how to pop corn on the stovetop.  
  urlLink   Women Don't Ask : Negotiation and the Gender Divide   Sounds like it should be an interesting look at gender issues in the workplace, hopefully without lapsing into either blaming the male patriarchy or telling women they are biologically unfit to compete. 
 I wanted a copy of this for my birthday, but I was too afraid to ask.  Har.
