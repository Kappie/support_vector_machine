I've only been able to get internet access for like 2 minutes at a time.  Might be a problem with the wireless network or something.  I've been craving internet access all weekend.  I had no idea how much I relied on it.  At least my phone works.  That would be tragic.  Got to see Alexandra and Mike for too short of a time.  They're still the same fun people that they've always been.  We're going to have lots of fun in the fall.  I think B and I are going to Walden Pond today then back to Seattle tonight.    Don't forget to call your dad for Father's Day.
