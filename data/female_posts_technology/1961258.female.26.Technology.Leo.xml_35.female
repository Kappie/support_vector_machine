Had a very tiring day at work but it's just a horrible excuse.   Back on the horse again, tomorrow. If I don't cut back on the food .. I'll really suffer on Thursday or Friday when I really hit the liquid diet.   Of course more workouts, will not justify that with any more excuses. Will do some squats and such before bed.  Good news - got a swimsuit, that fits beautifully and I look good - from the front. The back is a little icky - no backfat but I have a huge back. And of course from the side .. I don't have the nice curving in at the stomach. I guess I can say I have a womanly body, but .. that's not any kind of consolation.
