Anyway, this is the veil that I got from Kirstin, since she didn't use it for her wedding. I've attached it with velcro to a hairclip. You can at least get an idea of the length here. I'm thinking of getting some sort of headpiece to go with it. I could get a tiara to kind of tie in to the sparkly beads on the bodice of the dress, perhaps.
