But I've gotta give the boy props...this new album....Which   have NOT purchased  but have sampled    urlLink courtesy of MTV's first listen    Heck, even Miss Janet is getting down with the boy. (I can't blame her either - if you got it go for it!!)   he's actually goin for the real grove - and lots of sounds that are obviously influenced by the greats  Stevie Wonder  in particular. Which really wants to make me take out all of  LP's  and park my butt on my carpet and rock-out in my room - like old times...  "She's a Bad-mamma-jamma"
