It worth 2 stars out of 5 but Ethan Hawk earns them another one start. :"> He's damn cute in the show. Kiefer Sutherland (the lead actor in 24) was good, pity he wasn't given much to play.  2. Barney's World Tour is coming to Singapore.   3. Black Eye Pea is coming to Singapore!!!!!!!  4. Kill Bill vol2 opens today!! "They" want to do the vol.3 but Uma don't want to continue anymore. Good move Uma. Cos Vol3 I heard, is stupid and getting too draggy. :|
