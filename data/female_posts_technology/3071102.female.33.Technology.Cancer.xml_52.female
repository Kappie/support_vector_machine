    
       we pause for this blogging moment... I am doing anything that I possibly can to NOT study for my final on Wednesday OR finish a paper that I also have due on the same day... I am wondering, with my summer daze going on, how I will make it this fall when I will be taking MORE classes? MADNESS, I surmise.
