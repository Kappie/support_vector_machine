Started the day out with one heavy duty circuit workout at the gym and followed it with a nice hot water bath..man, the hot man believe me helps to soothe those muscles up! Then I decided, its time to start to pick up some of the old pieces of my life...yes, my painting. Had about 2 paintings overdue and 3 orders, so it was high time I put my ass on the line and completed it. So after slogging it out for 4 hours thro the afternoon, I finally took a break and decided to listen to some of my old cds. Hardly had an idea as to what I was playing, put pushed in the cd, closed the room door, lay on the ground and allowed the music to take over my senses.  Gosh, I seriously dont know how I picked this particular CD....the songs were a little on the older side, most of my favorites which I had compiled over a little more than a year ago. The songs sure did haunt me.....too apt for my current state of mind...  Toni Braxton - Unbreak my heart, Spanish Guitar  Breathe Again Eric Chalpton - Tears in Heaven Wet Wet Wet - Love is all around Daniel Bedingfield - If you are not the one Wham - Last Christmas Madonna - Say good bye Celine Dion - Power of Love Seal - Kiss from a rose Phil Collins - Another day in paradise Take that - Nobody else OST Alladin- Its a whole new world OST Lion King- Circle of Life OST Dirty Dancing - I've Had the time of my life Bed  Breakfast - If you were mine  Gosh...these songs seriously messed with my emotional status today. I dont know, but everytime I seem to be urging myself to move a step forward, there is something from yester years which pulls me into a different mode altogether and I go on this..."what if things were so" routine! This is seriously painful for me, but then I guess its' something I have to go thro' and I know others too would be going thro the same....I'm not alone in this!  Anyway, towards the late evening, I decided enough is enuogh of my weird routine and I pleaded with my parents and went for a drive. This drive though took me to a 108 Divya desam place called Thiruvinanur. Nice quaint temple near Chennai, about one hour's drive, that too mainly becoz of the traffic! Sat there in the temple for about 40 minutes, had a good dharshan and got back home at 9. Now I am quite tired..had a long chat with my friend and discussed life and it's wonders with him....was quite ironical, esp with him, coz over a year ago I was kindof in a situation where I was advising him on his love life, decisions which needed to be taken, why it had to be taken etc...and now I was in a situation where my personal and professional life is kindof a mess and I have little or no energy to figure my way out...am quite like in a maze right now....heres' hoping I find a way thro' this maze called life! Cheers!
