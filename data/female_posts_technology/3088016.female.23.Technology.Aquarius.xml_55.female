First, I got a root canal around December on a front tooth that had been broken in the fifth grade and needed a crown.  Then, of course, I started having unbearable pain that was traced back to my wisdom teeth trying to move in.  Sixteen hundred dollars later, I'm starting to wonder whether the wisdom teeth were ever a problem at all.    The pain is back, and it got so extreme on Tuesday that I had to leave work.  I literally got teary-eyed while telling my boss why I had to leave - it hurt that bad.  The tooth farthest to the back on the top left side has had a cavity since the last time I went in for a cleaning.  It's hard to reach and apparently, I don't really have much room for it.  The cavity and the tooth are now infected, despite my efforts to keep my teeth clean, and the dentist recommends its  urlLink removal .  He cites the massive cost of a root canal and crown which only  may  save the tooth, versus having it extracted to make more room in my mouth and be rid of the problem.  Since I found this out, I have been brushing after every meal (5-6 times a day) in addition to the requisite morning and evening, plus flossing at work.  I don't know if teeth could be any cleaner.  I've been told that weak teeth run in my family - great.   I have feelings of fear and relief about getting this tooth removed.  Fear, because I understand that an infected tooth cannot be deadened and it's incredibly painful to have it removed.  The procedure is done only under local anesthesia, so I'll be fully aware of any pain I'm feeling.  I am on antibiotics to cure the infection, but I wonder if it could come back before June 16th.  If not, there should be no problem.  Relief, because it's supposed to be a hundred times simpler than my wisdom tooth surgery and I'll finally be rid of the pain that's bugged me for nearly six months.    There will no doubt be more updates on this.
