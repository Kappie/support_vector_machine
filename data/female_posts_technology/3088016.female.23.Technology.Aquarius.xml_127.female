I just needed a break.  No pushy guys, no whiny guys.  I just needed to hang out with my friends!  I am not saying that I'm discouraged, or don't want to do this anymore, but just needed to back away.  This internet thing can be fun, but I think I might need to take a step back.  My friend told me that I should do one of the more involved sites like E-Harmony.  I am considering that too!  I'm also trying to get out more and meet people the old fashioned way,in person.  Let's see how that works.
