Of the five men who have starred in ABC's  The Bachelor , none have been able to keep their relationships going.  The two women who have been Bachelorettes, Trista Rehn and Meredith Philips, are either married or engaged to the men they met on the show.  Even though I know it's a bit fake, I have for some reason stuck with this show through most of its seasons.  This season was the only one where the guy actually picked the girl I thought he should have; it unfortunately didn't work out because "individually, [their] next steps take [them] in different directions."  Was this something that they didn't discover before he picked her?   One reality show that probably won't disappoint me is the parody show,  urlLink Joe Schmo 2 .  This is the one where everyone except two people are actors, and the other two people think it's actually a reality show and they're all there for the same reasons.  I've only seen the first episode, but it's already funny.  The best part is how cheesy it is.  They parody  everything  about other reality shows, including the bad plot twists and goofy host.  Before every commercial they promise to show "the most shocking elimination ceremony ever!"  All of the actors play off some stereotypical character: the drunk, the player, the rich guy, the ditz, the gotta-be-gay guy.  Check out this show if you can.
