None of which I have even removed from the box yet. They have been sitting in the spare room untouched for the past week.  This begs the question, did I really need any of those items in the first place, despite the total purchase sum of these objects being relatively substantial?  Why the fuck then, did I buy them? I don't know, peer pressure, I guess.   Additionally, the situation begs the question - what have I been doing with my time, that I haven't even attempted to sit down and tinker with each of these new acquisitions?  Well, let's see, this week included a substantial television mini-series commitment, the baking of cupcakes for morning tea for a departing colleague, attempting to do more knitting and, oh I don't know,  I guess talking with people in person!  Gosh, completely low tech pursuits, while the potential for a high tech lifestyle sits untouched gathering dust.  How can this be in 2004?  While I felt slightly anxious at the whole inability to schedule time to plug everything in, I finally came to  the conclusion  that feasibly, the quality of my lo-tech life is possibly far superior to anything which can be provided by an electronic piece of equipment (oh, get your mind out of the gutter).  Although be warned, clearly, this time next week I'll be extolling the virtues of my groovy new mobile phone which apparently has lights which flash in time to loud music.   How cool is that?
