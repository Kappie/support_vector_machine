I took the initiative to ask him for meal yesterday but alas, it was a wrong move at the wrong time. He was busy and I was hungry. In the end, I went for dinner myself and he had his dinner with his long-time bosom friend...duh! I shared my view on how he handled a matter that concerns about one of our colleagues and somehow I believed that I brought out the optimisim within him. After the short chat with him, I realized that I do not have the chemistry with him...well, at least not anymore. I was wondering whether do we have any in the first place now...Shrugs.  Forget about that...I should concentrate on my studies now, provide my parents a better standard of living and sought for better life partner.   *Calculating* If I am to get married by 29, and pregnant by 30, my child would be at most 20 when I turn 50! Gosh...that sounds old....I better find someone to get married fast! Wahahahha
