I passed around the corner, and someone saw my grin.  When he smiled I realized, I'd passed it on to him. I thought about that smile, then I realized its worth.  A single smile just like mine, could travel the earth.  So, if you feel a smile begin, don't leave it undetected.  Let's start an epidemic quick, and get the world infected!   I seriously believe in smiles as they are truly infectious.  They can even be seen through the phones.  I talk on the phones for a living so I know.  Even the must riley of clients who have a beef about this or that are often joking with me by the end of the conversation.  Some say I have a gift or talent in getting a good raport with others.  Tell you a little secret though -- SMILE, you will make someone's day and do your part in generating smiles across the world!!
