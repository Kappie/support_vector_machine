We cleaned up the old one and hopefully they don't charge us too much for my sloppy bathroom cleaning...scrubbing toilets and bathtubs are the worst.  Rhy, my bro, has left for home (tears) and it is just Woody and I now.  We had a DVD marathon over the weekend.  I got the cold and didn't feel like going out.  The only time I went out was Friday night when Rhy treated me to dinner and I treated him to a movie.  Ate at Joe's Crabshack and watched our servers do the Macarena as the night's entertainment(uh-huh)....  Start of the year and we've already spent money. Woody bought a sweater on sale at Old Navy I bought socks and sweater and a new pair of jeans at American Eagle.  Woody, my cheapskate husband, gave me a $35 budget for my jeans.  Husband, I love you but you know you're cheap...people at work call him Mr. Cheap-o, a reputation which, oddly enough, he is proud of. Good thing AE had a sale going on.   New year's resolution: Obtain my network+ certification Start with my workout regimen and maintain it  Eat healthier Hopefully fit into my size 6 jeans again Save up for Las Vegas Be less LAZY!
