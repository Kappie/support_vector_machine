Quiet, loving and musical he will be missed RIP 1945 - 2003   I went to the wake yesterday morning. It was at the Fort Mason in Building A. The place was filled with people who loved and wanted to honor his memory. It was truly touching, and very emotional. I cried. Not for myself, but for his wonderful family who now have to live without him.  Then I decided to go hikin...in Marin...in a skirt...and flimsy shoes. It was not (obviously) a good idear.
