Humans are meant to be outdoors on a day like today.  My day started off pretty well. I got some good sleep last night. Even got to sleep in a bit since I was going to the chiropractor this morning. They don't open until 9, so I had a bit of a lie in. Dr. Doug the roommate helped me get started with the xrays. I've had a hip concern over the past several days. There is pain that hasn't gone away. Since it started with me trying to do a bit of jogging, it made me wonder if there was a joint issue going on. And with my mother having had a hip replacement at 42, I didn't want to risk it. The xrays look fine. There may be some minor calcium deposits, however they are not where they would be causing friction or pain. Diagnosis is continued exercise and more hip stretches.  I finally got to work a little after 10 this morning. I knew it would be a busy day for me since I've got a meeting tomorrow afternoon and the final requirements are going to be reviewed with the customer. I brought in leftover pizza and geared up for a busy day at the computer.  What is it, about certain things that just makes you aware of them at odd times? Today is my father's birthdate. If he were alive he would have been 57 today. We were not close, my father and I. I've thought on occassion since his death that he really missed out by not knowing me better. Maybe that's what brought tears to my eyes today. That and the potential that I may have missed out by not knowing him better. Whatever the reason, 10 years after his death and I am a bit raw with emotion today. Go figure.  The more I think about it, the more I attribute my raw feelings to the book I started listening to last night. It is "The Five People You Meet In Heaven" by Mitch Albom. It's a story with purpose. It's very moving. I've actually started taking some notes. Here are the things that have struck me so far:   Strangers are just family you haven't gotten to know yet.  No life is wasted.   The only time we waste is the time we spend thinking we are alone.    We are all connected.  The 1st lesson - There are no random occurrances.  Courage is often confused with picking up arms (weapons)....cowardice is often confused with putting them down.  The 2nd lesson - Sacrifice is a part of life. It is not something to regret. It is something to asipre to. Sometimes when you sacrifice something precious, you are not losing it, you are simply passing it on.  All parents damage their children. It cannot be helped. Some smudge, some crack, some shatter.   These were powerful statements to me. Especially the one about being alone. It's definitely a reminder to be more aware of my thoughts.  Of course even words that powerful don't keep me from putting my foot in my mouth! I actually told Casandra today just not to tell me anything because I'm to capable of doing something stupid like alluding to the knowledge in front of people I shouldn't. Sigh. It's bizarre to me how some knowledgeI keep so hidden so well, and other knowledge just seems to fall out of my mouth. Talk about feeling like I have a screw loose.  On a completely different note, I saw a prime example of the difference between men communicating and women communicating. At the chiropractor's office this morning, I was talking to a friend of mine. She's adorable and always puts a lot of effort into her appearance. She still looked cute this morning, however it was evident she didn't spend a lot of time on her hair or else she was just having a bad hair day. I thought this, though I didn't say anything to her about it. A few minutes later the doc walks up and is chatting. He looked my friend in the face and said "what's up with the do today- why the flat hair?" :o) What was the point of that? If she was having a bad day, that would have just crushed her mood even more. He may have been trying to joke. I'm not sure. I just couldn't help thinking he was a clod.  There are just a couple more things I want to mention before closing out today's post.......  First, in my eagerness to impart the tales from my weekend, I failed to mention the kudos awarded to me and my coworkers on Monday. We were asked to a senior management meeting and presented with certificates of recognition for work we did on a recent project. It was really cool! I just love our director and assitant director of finance. The certificate is hanging in my cubicle above my monitor. Gotta love being acknowledge for your hard work.  The other thing I want to mention is stem cell research. I'm potentially leaving myself open for a lot of character attacks if strangers read this. It can't be helped, because I want to share some information I found today. There is a lot of political and religious squabbling. The thing that bugs me about that, is the fact that this type of research as a whole is being bad mouthed.   From the little bit of research I've done, I've found that there are two basic types of stem cell research. Embryonic and Adult. There have been some successess in treating diabetes with adult stem cells. It's the embryonic part that is controversial. Stem cell research as a whole IS NOT A BAD THING. I disagree with those who would speak that opinion out of ignorance and the narrow understanding of what a few researches do. They don't take live babies and kill them to do embryonic research! And as it turns out, they seem to be experiencing more success with the adult stem cell research at this stage. So it's nothing to condemn out of ignorance.   Okay, I'm done with my soap box for the day. I have yet to determine what I'm going to do with my afternoon. I want to walk on my greenway, though I'm too drained to do that with company. I may just go home and do yoga. I don't know yet.  Happy hump day everybody. And here's hoping Doogie has fun at the Curiosa concert tonight! :o)
