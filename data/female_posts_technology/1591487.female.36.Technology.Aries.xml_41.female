I know this because I'm house sitting again and had to haul four washing baskets full of stuff with me.  And I still forgot the hair dryer and sneakers. And my books.  It would be alright if I was Mrs Glamorous Fashion-plate who looked immaculate every second of the day, but I'm not, I'm just me. Albeit me, with clearly, a hair product fetish.    Oh, bugger, I think I forgot the hair spray too. Hair spray, eh?  Such a dead giveaway for the high maintenance thing, clearly.  But I don't want to be high-maintenance, Mum!   I want to be the kind of carefree, easygoing girl in the old fashioned tampon ads.  Flipping around in jeans and t-shirt with nary a care in the world and without a handbag.  Girls in ads never have handbags, do they? Don't think I haven't noticed.  That's just wrong.  Maybe I just need to face the fact that my carefree days are over.  Actually, did I ever have any carefree days to start off with?  I don't think so, come to think of it.  When have I ever been carefree? Never! Who's carefree anyway? Irresponsible people, that's who!  But I digress.  I guess I just have to come to terms that I'm the kind of person that needs a lot of stuff to do stuff.    I've always advocated better living through chemicals, but only from a cosmetic perspective, of course.  Seriously, anyone with  hair like mine would understand.  Two words 'naturally curly', so 'naturally curly' that if anyone were to see it in its 'natural state', well, let's just say that people would be chasing after me with torches and pitchforks to drive me out of the village.    I also think my need for stuff smacks a little of misdirected hope.  As in 'surely this anti-frizz serum/cafe au lait lipgloss/geranium scented body lotion/egg separator' will make my life fantastic, fulfilling and oh, maybe a little carefree perhaps?  Oh well, hope springs eternal doesn't it? and if not, then at least I'm keeping the people at the pharmacy in a job.
