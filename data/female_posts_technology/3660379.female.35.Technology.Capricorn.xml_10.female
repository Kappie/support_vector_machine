Well, a minor back injury slowed me down for a couple weeks, and I decided it was time for me to start giving back to society, and this was the first thing I could think of doing as a volunteer.  The event was tons o' fun and  I met some very nice people and cheered on the participants.      In case you haven't heard the other big news, I'm starting a new job on July 26th.  I'm certainly going to miss having fun at work with  urlLink Matt ,  urlLink Seth , and  urlLink Henrik .  While the lure of a new job is exciting, I'll be honest and say that it's a little intimidating to start over again.      Finally, I solemnly pledge that before the end of the month, I'm going to make a quick stop at the car wash and vacuum out my little   urlLink  Corolla   .  The floor has gotten a tad bit dirty.. and she just isn't happy.
