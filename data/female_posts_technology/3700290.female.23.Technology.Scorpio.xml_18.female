If you have a big group of friends, you can choose to meet whoever is free to meet up with you and just go out to have fun. On the other hand, you would not feel comfortable in a sense that you can rely heavily on one person.... Hmmm..I am not very sure whether anyone know what I am talking about but it just suddenly dawned on me after a heart chat with Sharon.....  ****  My ego is really inflated after receiving compliments for two consecutive days .... One was even from a guy and he had mentioned that I am a perfect lady...wahahah... I am so scared that his illusion would be dashed soon....      ****     Anyway, I have already actioned to matchmake him and her together. To think that I felt delighted when I told them about each other...I am wondering whether would I ever feel jealous if they were to be together. *Shrugs* I have made the choice and I should not regretted it.
