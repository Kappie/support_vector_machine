I've never been a big fan of Tom Cruise, but I liked the director's other works, so I knew it was something worth seeing. Plus, the premise was pretty interesting. A hired killer hires a cab driver to take him to 5 stops. The hired killer gets to finish his assignments in one night and the cab driver earns twice what he makes on an average night.  "Collateral" really isn't your typical action film. It's more of a psychological drama involving 4 major characters. The sharp, witty dialogue though keeps you engaged with the movie and you really get to know the characters pretty well. You see how whether one is good or evil, there are common threads of experiences that run across every human being. There are the insecurties, unfulfilled dreams, doubts, hopes, fears, and all the other things that make up our life. The only difference is how we face up to those challenges. Are we going to be the best that we can be or are we going to spend the rest of our life drifting through existence while paying the bills?  The hired killer played by Tom Cruise believes he is seizing the day and living his life fully by his work. However, the cab driver played by Jamie Foxx has been lulled into a false sense of security despite the fact that he is a really good driver. He's been dreaming of putting up a limousine company for the last 12 years, but hasn't really had the guts to take that leap. In one night, they learn things about themselves and they do things they never thought they would. The cold-blooded killer saves the cab driver from robbers, policemen, and other characters intent on killing him. The cab driver, who has never given anyone trouble in his entire life, gains access to the depths of the underworld.  I guess my only complaint about the film would be Tom Cruise. This guy works really hard, but he wasn't really born with natural acting talent. The supporting cast pretty much overshadows his performance. He's just damn lucky that he was given a really good script to work with.  I'd recommend you all go watch it! However, if you are the typical brainless guy looking for mind-numbing violence onscreen, don't waste your time. I doubt it that you would like it.
