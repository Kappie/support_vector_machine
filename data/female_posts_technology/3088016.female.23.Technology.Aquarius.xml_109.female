This is what those in hip-hop (this may be the only reference you ever see to that type of music on my blog) would call "keeping it real."     urlLink     urlLink     One thing that I couldn't help but notice is that I had  11  visits yesterday from different variations of the search " urlLink William Hung " and "Take me out to the ball game."  Upon further research, every last one of them was from a different ISP.  There were actually eleven people who wanted to hear about William Hung and singing at the ballgame!   urlLink Yahoo Search  seemed to turn up my blog the most often, about which I can't complain.  Curious, I followed  urlLink one of the links  to find that he was scheduled to sing America's second National Anthem at a Toronto Bluejays vs. Texas Rangers game on Sunday.  This is what people care about.  To the Americans' credit, several of the ISPs listed were Canadian.  When will this fad end?
