One more week to CNY and I realise I need at least one decent attire. Went shopping at Suntec/Marina/Raffles City on Monday, Bugis on Tues, FarEast Plaza/Isetan on Wed and I suspect that the shops are clearing their last season's stocks. It's horrifying. I'm trying again today. It'll be Paragon/Ck Tang/Taka, and whatever that's still open and my legs can bring me to. I also conclude that I need to shed those extra fats or I can forget about fitting into dresses.   10 days after I wrote down 7 new year's resolution I'm finding it hard to keep a few. Haha.. what to do? Chocolate is my life, my weakness, my endorphine, my aphrodisiac (not that I need any.. haha..). Nevertheless, I still have 349 days to admit defeat! Until then, never give up!!
