( urlLink Click here for the full details of the Triathlon ) Then, I finally got to the theatre to see  urlLink Harry Potter .  (Loved the movie.. I can't wait for the next one)  Saw the  urlLink Spiderman 2 trailer  It looks great!!!    Finally, as a reward for all my hard work at training for the Triathlon, I went to a restaurant for a well deserved pizza dinner.  Imagine my surprise to see a clown there performing.    What a great day!!!
