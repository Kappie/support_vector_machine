I appreciate my guy ??? picking up my son for me everyday from school so I don't have to deal with parking issues. Seeing him everyday and not knowing what to say to him is really wearing me out. I guess if the doctor does put me back to work full time next week. The bright side would be I would not have an excuse not to pick my son up from school since his school is on the way home. The whole situation is just so awkward. I'm to tired to elaborate further tonight. I even have a headache which is a rare thing for me. I must go lay down and relax so I will be bright eyed and bushy tailed tomorrow. Peace :)
