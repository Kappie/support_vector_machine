Okay, to those who remember Gaby Concepcion, former Mr. Sharon Cuneta (hehehe), you guys know that he has/had children with other women, right?  Well, through a series of convoluted internet surfing, I found one that's almost the same age as KC Concepcion.  And apparently she is the reigning Miss Teen Filipina having recently won the 2004 competition. Name's Malay Concepcion.  Click  urlLink here  to find out more.     But that's not the weirdest thing.  The weirdest thing is that in the pictures of the competition, who was escorting her but Papa Gaby!  He looked so proud too.  I'm kinda irked at him for his absenteeism as a father to KC.  Oh well, not my problem.  Here are some pics:      As you can see, they're really bad so go visit the official website for better pics...and I'm really so baduy!  Okay, that's the last you'll hear from me about unheard of beauty pageant winners!
