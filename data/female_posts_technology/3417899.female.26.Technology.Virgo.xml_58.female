Bam, bam, bam... bam, bam, bara bara baaam.... I'm in an airplane (again) filled with business people (stiffs) and nobody is watching the movie. And me?  I am barely held in my seat by the seatbelt, the beat of the latin music carrying me, moving my hips to the rythm in the small confines of the airplane chair, and dancing away in my mind to  days long ago and  lands far away .
