I had planned to make strawberry jam this year, but missed out on the best u-pick berries. Shortly after that a friend commented on his appreciation for raspberries and my jam-making scheme was given new life.  Saturday I stopped at an innocent vegetable stand near my parents' cottage and purchased the five pints of berries required in my jam recipe. On Sunday I gathered around me the fruit, sugar, lemons, and Certo ready to commence with the boiling and stirring. Then what to my utter disappointment do I find but mold, MOLD on my berries! Yes, it appears as though they must have been quite taken with the stuff just under the surface when I bought them, for surely blooms like I witnessed there were not formed overnight.  After much wailing and knashing of teeth I determined I was not going to let these rampant spores ruin my jam! I meticulously picked out the berries untouched by any nasty fuzz and rinsed them in some warm water in the sink. I could make this work, I had lots of strawberries still frozen from my u-pick adventure last year; I would just supplement a few cups of one berry for another, genius! Now all I need is that large bowl....    CRASH!  BANG!   SMASH!    tinkle tinkle....    In reaching clumsily for the bowl I knocked it over and managed to also take out one of my onion-soup bowls in a shower of glass and pottery shards. I looked down at the collander in the sink, the berries now covered in the tiniest slivers of glass you've ever seen, and I swore like a sailor. I cleaned everything up and carefully packaged all the glass, and berries, in a cardboard box so as not to impale any unsuspecting sanitation workers.  And just to give you insight into my phsyche; I am more determined than ever to make raspberry jam now.
