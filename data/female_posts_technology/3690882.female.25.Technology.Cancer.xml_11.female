I was greatly amused to hear that it was first performed in 92 when the first Bush was elected and was recently revived in the past couple of years (hmmmm.....).   It's a great dark comedy and indictment of social inequities.  They focus on the sad lives the assasins lead before killing or trying to kill the president.  It's very much about the dark side of the American dream.  I swear some liberal millionaire must have decided to fund the revival of this play just to spite Bush Jr.    Got to go get lunch,    Bye
