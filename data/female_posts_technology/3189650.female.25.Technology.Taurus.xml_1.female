         "er, hang on a sec dearies, while i clear the screen yet again. There, now I can almost read what I am writing. Yippppeeeeewwwwachoooo!"    I seem to have been infected by the super-contagious list virus, last seen proliferating  urlLink here . The family doctor tells me that the only known cure is to start rattling off a list of my ownon the blog, no matter how humdrum, fatuous or moth-eaten. Further, this has to happen within 24 hours of my first sneeze, or else the virus will spread to ALL the other blogs I frequent. Hence I amsurethe following prosaic attempt at jotting down a list of the situations when I was made to wish I hadn't been born (or since that folly can't now be undone, the next best thing, when I desperately prayed for the power to simulate Yahoo's invisible mode in real life) will not only be sympathised with, but also appreciated.   #1 : Thishas the most recall valuein the list of my "oh-shit" quandaries I put myself into way too frequently. It came about when, in the hot pursuit of an errant hard-to-catch-and-super-fast male, I didn't realise I had actually chased him right into the gentlemen's restroom.   Now now, let me quash any wild ideas you naughty souls may be entertaining right now bytelling y'allthat this didn't happen at a wild night-out, both of us weren't inebriated, and the proceedings in the loo thereafter did not resemble those in the VIP Frenchie ad in any way. (Rotten comparison, I know, but somehow this is the only advert that comes to mind whenever I think of the men's loo. And you can ask why I happen to think of that particular enclosure so often. As I said, you can but ASK!)   Back on track, this took place way back in class II at school, and the 'guy' in question was no hunk (then, he grew up to be one though!) was a too-garrulous-for-his-own-well-being classmate, called V, and I was just fulfilling my class-monitorly duties by enthusiastically chasing him through the school corridors, so that I can bring him back to the class in triumph (trussing smart-alec kids in chains wasn't allowed even in those good old days, alas!) and make him stand on the bench. Bully, anyone?   As for the epilogue, there was none! *Serves right to all of you who were smacking their lips in anticipation of the mortifying aftermath for me* Just took me a couple of sweet-nothings in V's ear, telling him how I would conveniently forget about his defaulting on his Maths homework (guess who was supposed to collect the homework notebooks and deposit them in the staffroom for future perusal by 'miss'?) if he returned the favor by conveniently forgetting a much less significant recent happening.   As Inever tire of telling himsince, he was always a smart alec!   #2 : Thiswas quite recently, when....  "hey, no sneeze in the past 10 minutes!! guess the virus gave up! Let me save up on more such adventures for another rainy (literally!) day then."    Till I achoooo again!      Play it again, Sam! :   urlLink Aerosmith - Dream On      Say it again, Sam? :   "You will always be my friend. You know too much."       
     
      She has got mail. FROM HIM.   Its like a kick in the gut. Apparently, her system has had one of those virus attacks which makes it pick up random people from the address book and send nonsensical mails to them. And it sent a mail to him of all people! After four months of trying to convince herself not to give in to her inner demons and NOT mailing him, NOT calling him up and almost having made herself believe that she has gotten over him. So, she gets all worked up,   "Damn, Damn, Damn! Now he is going to think that I am again trying to spy on his life, even now, now that he is married. HAPPILY MARRIED."   But she is thrilled too, however irrationally, that he must have thought about her at least once while sending the mail. Anyhow, she decides that she wont reply back.   "Now that I have 'moved on', I should not want to get back in touch with him."    This honorable resolution lasts exactly half an hour, after which she starts thinking on the lines of,    "What’s wrong in a one-liner reply, after all I must not seem rude. He mailed me after getting that rogue mail, didn’t he?"   This line of thought then gives way to,    "See, he didn’t need to reply back, the fact that he did probably means that he wants to know what I have been upto. I SHOULD mail."   Doesn’t occur to her that IF he wanted to know about her, he could have probably added a line or two like, 'How have you been?" etc etc. And that he is just being polite, letting her know about the virus to save her further trouble.  She decides to wait for a day (since she doesn’t want to appear too eager to talk) before she replies, apologizing for the unintended intrusion. She also tells herself not to ask how he has been and stuff, just limit the reply to a stoic and impersonal one-liner, just as if getting a mail from him is an everyday occurrence and not too important for her. She also resolves that she would NOT think about it the whole of next day, dreaming up non-existent connotations.  She fails miserably, not thinking much else, and the first thing she does after getting back home the next day is send him the reply. To her credit, she manages to keep it short (her ego working to her advantage SOMEWHERE at least!)   "sheesh... sorry about that!"    She is pleased with herself when she deletes his email,    "Now there, got that out of the way, since he is not going to reply back, try to practice selective amnesia and get on with life."   all the while hoping in a pseudo sort of way that he WOULD reply back.   And he does. Nothing earth-shattering, just a simple,    "lol, that’s ok.. :)"    She feels a little upset and angry at him that he didn’t write anything else, and she tries to use it against him, to prevent herself from replying back,   "That’s that then. He intentionally left it as a dead end. Now I am not going to click the 'Reply' button and prolong the trail. I do not want to hurt myself any more. I do not again want to wait for his replies, trying to find out non-existent hidden meanings in perfectly innocent words, feeling shitty if he doesn’t reply how/what I want him to. I don’t want to go back to my 'Me Earth, You Sun' mode, letting my life revolve around him, when he doesn’t and has never given a damn for me."   But soon the fact that he replied wins over the disappointment at the length/content of his reply, and she is back to being comfortably-ecstatic again,   "Well, he could have as easily not, the fact that he did probably means he also at least wants to remain in touch with me, he also doesn’t want this chain of mails to die out."  Yeah, whatever!  After an almost sleepless night of struggling with herself as to whether she should reply to his mail again, she decides that she will, more woe. That evening, she spends two hours willing the frigging Yahoo servers to speed up, so that she can send him the mail. Eventually, she manages to compose a smartass reply, so that he is conned into sending a retort, just like the old days.   "and here I was quaking in my boots, thinking that you would do a SC (holier-than-thou ex-colleague) and holler,'It’s all because of those fucking sites you visit!' "   Yahoo misbehaves again and doesn’t show up the confirmation page. As if the anxiety of wondering whether he would deign to reply back or not isn't enough, she also has to contend with worrying about the mail managing to reach him before Yahoo decided to play spoilsport.   The next morning, after another night of fitful sleep, she stops trying to persuade herself NOT to reply back in case he does,   "Fat lot of good it is doing me anyways! In the end, I know I will give in. Anyhow exchanging mails isn't that big a deal, as long as you can deal with the possibility of painful topics like his wife (shit, even saying that hurts, bigtime!) coming up. Till the time you keep your feet firmly on the ground. And for God's sake STOP thinking that he has had a change of heart, you juvenile kid!"   and then that bout of self-pity again,   "How lucky *she* is, here I get almost unbearably happy at getting a mere mail from him, and that bitch is blessed enough to be able to see him, talk to him, feel him, run her hands through his hair, get angry with him, fight with him and then make up, and all those wonderful things, for the rest of her life... Why is life such a bitch??"   Anyhow, she is happier, much much happier than she has been in the last four months. She cracks jokes at work, pulls people's legs, hums along to herself, the Delhi heat doesn’t bother her any more. And she tries not to walk around with this wide, foolish smile plastered all over her face.   She ultimately decides to go along with the flow (or at least thinks that is a good enough excuse to turn a deaf ear to all voices of reason) and she checks her Yahoo mail today to see his reply (she tries not to look like the proverbial cat who ate the whatever),   "lol.. im not SC.. and you can visit all the sites you want to.. lol.. ;)"   First reaction,  "that’s all you could say? Couldn’t you have said anything else??"   Doesn't stop her from wanting to write back though. And quickly. Since the weekend starts today, and he won't be in to work for the next couple of days. Also, she doesn’t want him to think that she considers his mails unimportant enough not to reply back immediately.  Another wisecrack, perhaps, would ensure a reply again,   "Damn damn damn! Couldn't you have said this sooner? I have been deprived of my daily fix for exactly 2 days and 4 hours! Now what do I do about the upset tummy that it has resulted in?"   Two voices in her head this evening, #1 : "If I keep replying like this, I will continue to weave my days around his responses. And sooner or later, he is going to get tired of this mail business, and stop replying. How would I feel if I check my inbox tomorrow and see no reply from him? And what is this gonna lead to anyways?  Mails ARENT going to graduate to calls and meetings. He is NOT going to call me up one fine day that say that since the day we have restarted mailing each other, he has realized that he loves me after all and wants to marry me? (Yes, that thought has already done several rounds of my mind by now. Wish my words had such charm and power!)HE DOESN'T CARE A HOOT WHETHER YOU MAIL HIM OR NOT.  Why keep replying when THAT IS WHAT I WANT and when NOTHING ELSE IS ANY GOOD? Why keep pretending that sending mails is okay, after all we are friends, arent we? Coz I CANNOT BE JUST FRIENDS WITH HIM. I LOVE HIM TOO MUCH FOR THAT."  #2 : "Take things as they come. You are mature enough not to read too much into all this. Think of the bliss it gives you to be back in touch with him, if only through mails.  You will be miserable if you don't reply. You will keep thinking, however absurdly, if he has taken offence at your NOT replying. Not sending a reply would not stop you from daydreaming about him, would it?"    Should she reply? Should she not? Should she even mail him on his birthday, which is coming up in a couple of weeks?    P.S.: Any comments on the nauseating number of times the words "reply" and "mail" have been repeated in this post will be taken in the worst possible spirit! 
     
         Disclaimer : The below is the product of a sleep-deprived, melodramatic and depraved mind, and I will be surprised yet again by the resilience the human mind displays in face of adversity if you manage to go through this obscenely long post. I say a silent prayer for thee, o brave, if atad foolhardy,soul!      What follows is a tale of two speakers, not of the electronic varietyyougeeks, but fellow homo sapiens and esteemed colleagues of mine.   There was a prez on one of those new-fangled languages at office today, one in a series periodically conducted by the gurus at work (also known as crackpots among the less-technologically-inclined). The two 'speakers' are henceforth referred to as M and F. This is intended to protect my interests more than theirs, just in case they stumble upon this sacred space somehow. (I think I should call the CNN people and tell them not to air the feature on my blog until I give them the go-ahead). Since contemplating my project-mates' reactions when they read what I am about to write is about as pleasant as watching Shoaib Akhtar gloat (all the while trying to impersonate *a flying object* careening horribly out of control) whenever he gets an Indian batsman out, I will desist from meandering any further and come back on track with my account of M  F's brush with fame/notoriety (this I leave you to decide)one balmy afternoon in July.   *Never quite figured out if it is a jet or an eagle he was in a previous life. I would have bet on a eagle judging by his looks, but as I begrudgingly admit to family and friends, the jet part looks plausible too because of the damned speed at which the guy runs in to bowl.*   First off, let me give you a quick introduction of our two protagonists. M is this suave, however arrogant, guy, who is quite a hit with the smallish female population in the office (God knows why). You will understand the relevance of this fact as I proceed. His teammate, F belongs to the clan of damsels who possess the delectable combination guys find too hard to resist: beauty, charm, wit and a certain engaging fragility.   As if that isn't enough, she has got the most mellifluous voice to add to her virtues, which makes even the most macho of my male colleagues go all gooey-eyed when in her presence.         Please note that whatever be my opinions of them otherwise, the above is an unbiased sketch. Perhaps you will agree with me when I tell you that I can't stand the sight of theM type of male, cocky and abrasive as he is. As for F, I consider you smart enough to understand that a woman will never appreciate another woman, until she has got a good reason for it. I chose to suffer this self-inflicted torture so that you, my dear readers, can understand what transpired today.   The two most important things to remember, however, as we delve further into this incident are :     #1 : M is a male and F a desirable female. Oh well, i will say it, M is a desirable-to-the-most-devoted-ofM male.  #2 :The females atmy workplace are hopelessly outnumbered by their male counterparts.   So the presentation was divided into two parts of half an hour each. M started off the prez in a manner which suggested that it was the last thing in the world he wanted to do, with a I-really-don't-know-and-care-what-I-am-talking-about-and-dare-you-morons-ask-me-any-stupid-qs expression on his face. I did try todiscard these uncharitable thoughts from my mind (attributing them to my usually nasty disposition, aggravated by my dislike for the man) and was settling down to an hour's uninterrupted sleep in the back row, but alas it wasn't to be!        Apparently, the majority of the gentlemen in the audience shared the same feelings, or probably it was an already thought-out conspiracy. Whatever it was, they decided they just couldn't understand a word of what M was saying. Each sentence ofM's was punctuated by a question or a remark, people questioned the very basics of the topic being covered and sometimes led the discussion onto a wild goose chase, and the grunts and whispers were intentionally loud enough to carry to the speaker when he wasn't able to answer a query, which I noted with devilish glee, was quite often.   The next half an hour was eminently enjoyable, as M completely lost his poise and his already-questionable command on the topic, and just about managed to hem and haw through the slides, whenever the poor guy got a chance to speak. I could see the ladies in the front seats hanging on to every word he spoke, and give him sympathetic glances when the going got too tough. Perhaps it was their unspoken but fervent support that carried him through the half hour. Anyhow, all thoughts of a nap were driven from my mind as Iobserved M's ordeal. I wasn't too glad when he handed F the baton.   The ladyvery gracefully came forward and continued from where M had left, rather in haste it seemed. As she started to explain the intricacies of the subject under discussion in her hypnotically dulcet tones,I could sense the uncanny hush that descended upon the male subset of the audience. (The ladies I guess were still recovering from the shock of the treatment meted out to the Adonis).          The contrast to the pandemonium prevailing 10 minutes earlier could not have been more stark. As I looked on, the loopholes in the arguments of the lady were conveniently forgotten as the men meditated on the better things in life. I even found the particularly aggressive fellow sitting next to me nodding sagely as F tried to explain a particularly tricky scenario, repeating exactly what M had said a few minutes ago, and which this laddie had so vigorously contested. Ah, as someone told me, such is life!   The rest of the prez went by quite uneventfully, with a couple of deferential qs addressed to F towards the end, which to my suspicious mind, was to prolong the wonderful time everybody was having more than anything else. The agenda in the beginning said that M would be rounding off the prez, but apparently he thought the better of it and let F do the honors. Bah! I could have done with some more of the amusement!   As I was walking back to my desk, I was glad none of my fellow colleagues could read my thoughts, taking off from what   urlLink  Robin Williams so eloquently expressed   , "The other head at work?"    Play it again, Sam! :    urlLink  Hootie  the Blowfish-Only Wanna Be With You         Say it again, Sam? :  "I would give my right arm to be ambidextrous."
