I do not have tolerance for spicy food ..so I took an embryo size droplet and place it on the edge of ma taco ..and proceeded to take a hefty size bite… suddenly I became enchanted by this luscious texture of finely chopped tomatoes, onions, and coriander… I was baffled that I was actually enjoying this heartburn causing poison in an orgasmic way ..before long I ladled out a huge scoop of this new venom and smeared it all over the bed of lettuce and devoured it like a deprived Somalian hyena… before long I was reaching for seconds ..I knew that the salsa was tainted but with what?.. my tongue tingled at the spiciness but kept asking for more ..and my lips burned with eternal fire ..I knew I was hooked.. like a fetus to it’s umbilical cord …what caused this madness?… why was I not able to have any self-control? … why was I not able to think for myself?.. something had taken over me.. I was addicted.. but to what ..salsa.. no I think S anti must have tainted the salsa with cocaine.. she had to … like the old coca cola soda pop.. they used to put cocaine in it to have their consumers addicted to their useless idea of soda with no nutritional value.. was S anti trying to get us addicted to her salsa.. by tainting it with an illegal substance …would she dare ?…   Question of the Day…?  What do you find yourself addicted to?
