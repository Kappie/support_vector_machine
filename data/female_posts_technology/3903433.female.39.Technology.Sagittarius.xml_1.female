Carl Sagan's books. Paradigms Lost/Regained, The Emperor's New Mind, Briane Greene's Elegant Universe (string theory), Whitley Strieber's The Path and The Key, http://www.futureperspective.com/futpers.htm, Power vs. Force. It's become obvious from all fronts that there is far more than meets the eye, and that there seem to be numerous dimensions we can't perceive, possibly even multiverses. Time and space are an illusion, so why do we perceive time and space? Why can't we see the future? Why must we grow old, infirm, and die?  I've always looked on this universe as a giant playground, a place to explore. Then this thought occurred to me. Do we perceive time and space so that we experience what we otherwise could not?  What would happen if we didn't have time? If we could see everything all at once - past, present, and future? Would we be able to enjoy music? Or would we perceive everything all at once, one giant chaotic cacophany? Would we enjoy the dancer who floats gracefully across the stage? What about watching those sunsets? There are times we all feel constrained by time and space, we'd love to break those barriers and see beyond them. And I'm all for exploration, I feel it's inevitable. But as we seek beyond what we know, do we truly appreciate what we do have?
