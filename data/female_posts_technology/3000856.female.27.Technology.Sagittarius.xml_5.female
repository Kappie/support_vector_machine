My brother-in-laws cousin was hitting on me right in front of his girlfriend so that was awkward.  I did not want to be a bitch but at the same time I wanted him to lay off.  Some people just get so stupid when they are drunk.  We had fun though.  My bro played the guitar while I sang.  By the way....I am in this band now.  Pretty exciting but very nerve wrecking.   The guys seem pretty cool and a lot of fun. I can't wait till everything really gets set in motion.  It looks really promising.  I miss Shannon as usual and I am scared that I will run into her doing a gig.  That would be very awkward and strange.  Eventually I will get over this whole ordeal. I have to get some sleep now it has been a very long weekend.
