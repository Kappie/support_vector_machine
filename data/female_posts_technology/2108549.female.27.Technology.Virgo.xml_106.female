It was an easy $10 a week to baby sit for a few hours on Friday nights.  I did this until I was around 18 or so.  Every Friday night I would get there around 7, play games and do origami and crafts with the kids til they went to bed and I watched tv.  S and Ka were the parents I wanted.  They listened when I talked, they were interested and they wanted their kids to have every advantage in life.  For high school graduation, S built my first computer.  A 386, which at the time was the best of the best.  I broke that thing and had it fixed so many times I lost count.  That's what got me started in computers.  Bought a DOS book and thought things like fdisk and dblspace would be fun to try.  I got into the Grateful Dead, they got less active with Amway, the babysitting became less and less and I moved and we lost touch.   Presently... When I started at Intel I remembered S had worked there and looked him up.  He was still there so I shot him a "Hi, Remember me..." e-mail.  I never got a response and never really thought about it again.  Thursday I was walking into work and saw someone that looked somewhat familiar although I couldn't place the face exactly.  Then he started talking to someone else and I recognized the voice.  It was S. I said his name quietly enough that if it wasn't him, I wouldn't be humiliated.  He turned around and I did the "Hi, 'member me".  We talked and it turned out M was graduating that night from High School.  He invited me to the party yesterday as a *surprise guest*.  We had lunch Friday and got all caught up and made the plans for yesterday.  I showed up yesterday, completely nervous, second guessing if the kids would even remember me.  M opened the door, no recognition at all.  I asked for his dad and he went and got him.  As I was walking out in the backyard, Ka saw me and instantly recognized me, BIG hugs all around.  Then K saw me and did the same.  It was so good to be there yesterday.  Ka and the kids reminded me how much a part of my life they were and I theirs.  They have a third child, Pa, who is 7 that I got to meet. I was reminded of what an integral part of my upbringing they were.  It was Ka I told about my first kiss,  I confided in about the abusive boyfriend and the kids that kept me sane through it all.  We promised to keep in touch and I have no doubt that it is a promise that will be kept.  It was total God thing in each and every way.    As for the lake..... Well, J from work (not my other Ju) and her boyfriend R, invited me to the lake today to hang out and enjoy the sun.  Freedom and I got there and we were all enjoying his enthusiasm, and being that they are also both sober, the soda and water.  There were 2 single guys next to us with jet skis and then on the other side, a group of 18 or 19 year old.  About 4 guys and 3 or 4 girls and their bulldog.  Well yeah, there is a leash law in place but neither Freedom nor their dog was on a leash.  Freedom goes out to the water and back to me and that's about it.  He listens and comes when called and has never gone through anyone else's area.  Well, I wish I could have said the same for the bulldog.  He came tromping through our stuff, leaving water and sand on our towels and we ignored him.  I must say though when he lifted his leg on R's truck, we were all irritated and angry.  R told the guys to get their dog out of our area and back on a leash.  They did... for a short time.  Then the dog came back, this time to lift his dog on R's trailer.  So R picked up a handful of pebbles, tiny stones really and threw them near the dog to try to get him to leave.  Well the jerks next to us start yelling about Rick throwing things at their dog and this asshole picks up a rock the size of my hand and throws it at Freedom.  I yelled at him to knock it the f--- off and he picked up a larger one and did it again.  I lost it at that point, I jumped up and ran over without even stopping to think.  OK, I am a girly girl.  I don't know how to fight, I don't even know how to throw a punch other than what me and Billy Blanks practice with Tae Bo.  But it was Freedom and there was no way I could let anything happen to him.  The kid shoves me, knocking himself over in the process, R comes over to grab me and go after the kid and then the single guys came running over.  They were yelling at the kids, R was yelling at them, J had Freedom by the collar because he was coming to protect momma.  It ended about there other than smart remarks, dirty looks and the like.  I'm not really proud of my reaction, yet... its Freedom and my reaction was far from thought out or planned.  It was a knee jerk reaction.  One that if it ever happens again, I hope I am better prepared for!   Work...  Is going awesome. I got a review last week and all are pleased with me, my performance and my skills.  I pretty much have a world of doors open and I just need to figure out which ones I want to go through.  I got a lot of compliments and it was nice to be able to talk about some of the issues we deal with just in the working environment, not necessarily about the work itself.  I think that if I stay on the track I am on right now, I have a very good future there.  And best of all, tuition reimbursement kicks in next month so I'm goin back to school.  For what yet, I dunno but somethin!  :)
