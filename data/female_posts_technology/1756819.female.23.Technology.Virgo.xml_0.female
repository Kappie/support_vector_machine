Now of course I don't have ants in my pants at all, but rather am feeling restless and unsettled.  I can just imagine what it would be like to have ants in my pants...itchy and uncomfortable (not to mention a little creepy).  I suspect that my current state of antsiness has to do with the fact that I'm looking forward to a long weekend and I'd rather be outside enjoying what little sun there is today.  I just hope that the ants leave me in peace for a while so that I can get some work accomplished today.
