She  urlLink claims  that it's a lot better than going out and actually buying the expensive drugs when one can just go in the backyard and pick off a leaf to calm the nerves.  In addition to prescribing marijuana for her own patients, she is actually a first year professor to medical students at the University of Southern California.  I bet they're proud of the message the med students are getting.    This could he all for naught, though.  Dr. Jensen would probably be relieved to realize that a lot of the work has been done for her.  Teenagers with ADHD have been self-prescribing pot for years.
