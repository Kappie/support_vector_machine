Although work has me ticked off. They tried telling me I could not take off Aug 2 because all of a sudden there would be no one to cover on that day. Oh fucking well...... I gave them a lot of notice and I already have my itinerary. So what they have to do as far as I am concerned is not my problem. Malise and I drank a bottle of wine last night. I got real tired real fast. That is enough for today talk more later if I have time. Dena comes in at 4:20 in the morning! GEEZE!
