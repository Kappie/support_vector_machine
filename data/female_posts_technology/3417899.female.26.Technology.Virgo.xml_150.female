Clean-cut, professional, respectful, handsome and very polite. Married.  Today a letter addressed to him was received at our office. As we have no forwarding address for him, and the envelope looked like it might be a business related letter - our secretary opened it.  In the envelope was a love-filled, lustful short letter in a greeting card. Apparently from an ex-girlfriend or lover. In this card, she expressed her undying love.. how she'd been carrying around his picture for years... how they had a second chance a couldn't "blow it again". She listed dates when she'd be alone (her husband traveling) when they could meet.  It was a very personal letter, which we had desecrated by reading - a sin which I am compounding by writing about it in my blog.  That peek into his secret life, so different from the man we had known - was a rush.  Knowing we weren't supposed to read what we were reading, know what we had learned, guess what we deducted... I couldn't help it.   I, voyeur.     Then I thought, something like that could happen to me. Either before or after I'm gone - someone could write an incriminating letter to me. My colleagues could find it. My husband could read it.  Worse than this blog.  And I recalled a letter I received (when, I can not say - nor from who) - and which could have been found.  I looked it up, re-read it. And remembered. Once upon a time... Here is the letter - devoid of any identifying names or details - but in its entirety.  urlLink
