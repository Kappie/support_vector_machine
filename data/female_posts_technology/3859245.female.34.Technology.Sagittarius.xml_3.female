My 1 year WLS anniversary is coming on July 29. I have gone from 286.5 to 150ish. I am pleased as can be buying my size 2-8 clothing and I feel great.   I went to a plastic surgeon on Tuesday.  urlLink Dr. Shamoun  seems to be a great guy, and very qualified. Of course this is not a medically necessary procedure so it is going to cost me about 28k if I go with him.  He was very reassuring however. A tummy tuck, a lift of the old bootie and a medial thigh lift will get rid of the skin. This could be done in two operations. The thigh lift is to be done alone, I guess it is trickier. He showed me by a lot of yanking and pulling at the skin that I don't really have much fat on me at all. He even said, look at that, do you see any fat on you? I don't.  That was nice to hear.  I do have a hernia, which is something to consider as I visit other surgeons. I am going to try and get a referral so another doctor that is in my health insurance and might be able to do the tummy and hernia together and get insurance to cover it. I don't want to choose a doctor just because it will cost me less. I want the right doctor for the job.  I will keep you posted.  Julianna
