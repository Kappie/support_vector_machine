Last night Dr. Leif presented to me my new torture devise, the Shwarz retainer. I know, so rad!! All the other doctors admired it as it is the latest and greatest in the field of orthodontics for it will not just retain my teeth but move them to their rightful place in my mouf. Dr. Leif did the robot dance for me after which we laughed at my version of 'she sells sea shells'. Good times. Then I took it for a spin at The Lovemakers show. Thank you, Batty, for being my friend when the bouncer asked questions about my expired license and I embarrassed both of us by answering him in my new retarded/deaf/brooklyn accent voice, for buying my pear cider so I didn't have to order and, most importantly, for being patient when trying to figure out what the feck I was trying to say the whole night. Thith ith weelly fun! I'm at wok now and I can't wait to thpeak up at a meeting!
