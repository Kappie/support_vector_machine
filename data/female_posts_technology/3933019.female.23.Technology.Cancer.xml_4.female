And I'd give up forever to touch you      Cause I know that you feel me somehow      You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be      And I don't want to go home right now         And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming      Or the moment of truth in your lies      When everything feels like the movies      Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive          Well, i told u i'm a senti person!!!
