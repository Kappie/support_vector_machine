These kind of people and few and far in between - the kind that will stop to help a stranger out.  My father was lucky enough to have run into someone like that today. He was lost on a NY highway and frazzled, no knowing which direction to go to get back on track.  This guy at a gas station helped him out, and not only let my dad follow him, but also gave him his cell phone - in case he got lost again. Which, he did. This mystery nice guy proceeded to spend a long time on the phone with my dad pointing him in the right direction and making sure he got where he needed to go.    It is comforting to know people like that still exist , even in NY.  I have the guy's first name and cell phone number and wish I could do something to express my appreciation. What is proper protocol? A thank you call? Find out his address and send a card or gift? (Or is that too creepy?).  Well, whatever I end up doing, that guy is certainly going to have good karma.
