Linda was rather enthusiatic and asked a couple of classmates to take a look. However, most guys are not interested. I do not know what was the reason behind. Perhaps I should go and find out.   Patrick had the idea to drop off from the course as he just got to know that the degree course is NOT recognised by SAF. Damn...this news was as bad to him to me. It just shows that the paper is going to be how useful for job seeking next time.   I think I should concentrate on studying on the time being. It is going to examination time soon. 24 days more to be exact and I have not really started studying. My goodness! I better stop surfing the forum for the time being.   GOAL(s) ========  A for AT B for AI
