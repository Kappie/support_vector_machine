It is my most prize possion that I own.  Not even my computers are worth more to  me than that. I love this present more than anything else in the world that I have been given.  It may sound stupid.  But it even has a wish inside.  I wished a 2 part wish.  It may sound childess  but I pray my wish comes true.     I still think he wants to leave me.  I have come to the decision that I wont stop him.  I will just pray that he will come back to me.  I want to just devour him and show him how much I love him.  Why do I hold back.  I think I have been holding back all along.  DAMNIT...I love him.
