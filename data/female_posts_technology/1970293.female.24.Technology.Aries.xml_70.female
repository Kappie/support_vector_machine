Next he would remember to bring his winter clothes before going on a trek with a dragon.   "Are we here?" Bardric asked as he yanked his fingers from the scales and flexed them slowly, feeling pins and needles.  "Actually no but I thought I would give you a chance to warm up before finishing the last part of the trip. The rest of the way is just about as warm maybe a little cooler depending on shadows and things." Trellian said with a smile as he swooped closer to the ground.  "Oh you didn't need to stop on my account. I am completely fine. Not even a little bit cold." Bardric boasted to the dragon.  "Oh that would explain the two hands frozen to my scales for a little while." Trellian smiled as he landed on a ledge.  "But why stop now though. I am slowly thawing out." Bardric asked as he tried to jump off only to find himself frozen in his seat.  "That's why we are stopping. We can't have you looking like a fool as you try to thaw out." Trellian said as he turned his head to look at the wizard trying yank himself lose.  "You know you should warn me about this. I could have done something so I wouldn't become frozen to your back." Bardric said as he pulled his staff out. He said a small spell and suddenly a bucket of hot water poured down on the dragon's scales.  "Ouch!" The dragon yelled.  Bardric pulled himself away from the scales and hopped down to the ledge. He turned to see the dragon hopping a little from the hot water. "Come now. That couldn't have been that hot. Why it never bothered me a bit."  "That's because you're not human. You're not a demon. You are just plain cruel and mean to do something like that to a cold dragon." Trellian hissed at Bardric.  "At least I am not longer frozen on your back." Bardric said with a smile as he sat down on a rock.
