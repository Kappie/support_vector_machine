I'll show you the moves if you ask nicely (and if I can remember).  I apologize in advance for the use of the term "Injun." as it was written before political correctness.  These days, even use of the term "Indian" is controversial.  I have the utmost respect for Native Americans.   urlLink Valley Cottage Indians Cheerbook
