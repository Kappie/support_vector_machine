Below is one of my favorite sites:   urlLink CNN/Money   -------------------------------------------------------- Adding more stuff....I think I'm gonna like this blogging thing. I love to talk but there's the small problem of no one to listen to me.  Let's see, I have my husband, Woody and my brother, Rhy, who are probably the only two people in the world with whom I do not run out of things to talk about.  But when I talk to them, they insist on talking back. Even when I'm not asking questions.  Even after I interrupt them.  I'll say something and they'll insist on returning the favor by saying something related to what I just said. (Who cares what happened to you, I'm talking about what happened to me!)  Anyway, ode to Da Ganda whose posts inspired me to start blogging. She can be found here  urlLink daganda   I think she (daganda) may be quite popular and have a large circle of friends/acquaintance to read her blog.  I only have my husband and my brother.
