See, I thought it was going to be, like, one of those new age poetry readings (like the bit in Rent where they start mooing), something his film school buddies recommended.  But, I figured, everything is worth trying once. (Except for broccoli.)  So we went to  urlLink 45 Bleecker Theater  for the Friday night show of "Bridge and Tunnel".  It was nothing like what I expected - I was completely blown away by the performance.  She does dozens of different characters, switching back and forth between guises at the drop of a hat.  She has a really instinctive understanding of the backgrounds of each one - each seemed like it was effortless, not like a performance.  The poetry read by each individual character was pretty neat - some was funny, some was serious, all of it was well written.  But the one by the young Vietnamese character just reached out and grabbed me - the style and the rhythm felt  right , as if all other forms of verbal expression were just shadows of what is possible.  It was the first poetry slam I had ever heard, and as I listened to it, it made me really want to write poetry like that too. I mean, I'm not going to quit my day job and move to the village and turn all bohemain, but it's been a while since something new called to me like that.  Anyway, this post is called "limericks of mass destruction" because that's my favorite line from the performance - the main character is warned that the government might investigate his gathering of immigrants reading poetry, and he responds, "what are they expecting to find - limericks of mass destruction?"  So, in that spirit, I have one:  The UN once got an injunction Barring Iraqi weapons production   But what did Bush see   In each bombed city? Just limericks of massive destruction.
