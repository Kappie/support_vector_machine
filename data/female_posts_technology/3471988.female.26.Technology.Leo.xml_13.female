I tried to scout them out on MG Road but either they were super shy or they really didn't go out at all. Or perhaps I was just to straightforward in my questions and shocked that I would ask such questions. I was a little disappointed. I am ready to meet some cool people and show me how the Bangaloreans party! Particularly the trance going crowd! :) I know you are out there!
