Some small change in life prompts a whole lot of dominoes falling and life shifts plane and things aren't quite what they used to be?   Most people I guess, try constantly to make that happen - most young people, perhaps. But not me, I like my comfort zones - er, der! That's why they're called 'comfort'!  Perhaps this is how the first protozoa felt on the way to becoming a fish or whatever it was that came out of the swamp to eventually become life on earth.  I would have stunk at evolution. Seriously. I would have been the one saying 'no, that's fine, you go on ahead'. I'm quite happy staying here in the middle of the space rock, it's nice here, I know where everything is. But send me a postcard when you make New York City'.  Anyhoo, there's a whole bunch of comfort zones being intruded upon currently, so it's pretty much occupying most of my head space. Which makes for a very dull blog I'm sure, so why don't you go  urlLink here    urlLink   and look at something nice.   Or  urlLink here   urlLink   and learn the words to a lovely song. Go on, then.
