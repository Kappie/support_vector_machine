If you can help someone who needs it, do it.  Don't put off helping someone who needs it if you can help them now.  Get along with your neighbors, with those around you, who have no reason to distrust or suspect you - don't blindside them with something that can hurt them for no reason.  Don't lay down judgments and make accusations as a third-party observer.  If someone has done you no harm, leave them alone.  Don't be violent, or appreciate violence.  That would go against God.  Do what God wants you to do and you'll be part of his family and have a close relationship with him.  The helping others who need it part is something I've been thinking about more often.  I would love to be able to do something that helps people for a living -- I mean, really helps people, who have immediate needs, not in some obscure arms-length sort of way.  Bobby and I briefly talked about foster parenting, but I'm not sure that's right for me, for the same reasons I haven't been sure about parenting my own child.  I know there's something out there that I can and should be doing.  It'll come to me, and I hope that when it does, I act on it the way I'm supposed to.
