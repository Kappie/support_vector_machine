I am not a Rabbit, actually, I might be a Pussy, or possibly a Squirrel, but it has yet to be completely agreed upon at this stage. If I was a Rabbit, then perhaps I would have not been tired the next day at school/work...  but of course, I was!   I was completely entertained with lots of beautiful men to look at, until I suddenly awoke on the Rabbit/Dog couch at 4AM.  Oh well...  I was off to home, and bed... and lots of beautful, but gay men to think of.
