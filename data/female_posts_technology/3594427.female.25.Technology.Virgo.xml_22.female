I had to check the Internet for the proper format and findideas for how to put painful truths in a more diplomatic manner. I also asked my friends to edit it for me just to make sure I got everything right. The important thing is that it's done.       After sending my resignation letter via email, I went out to meet some of my friends. It was raining, but this time I was no longer afraid of the rain. For the first time in 3 years, I walked in it. It was like I suddenly felt alive again. I felt like I had finally freed myself from what was holding me back from becoming who I truly am meant to be.       I finally had THE CONVERSATION with my boss this afternoon. He was suddenly so nice to me today. He was even trying to get my sympathy by saying he fell down the stairs during the weekend so his back is not in good shape at the moment. He was even telling me how people have been giving such good feedback about me, so how could I think of leaving. It's just that people don't change overnight. He could be nice to me today, but who's to say he won't scream at me again 2 months from now at 2 AM in the morning.       Gosh, I guess it's really human nature that people will appreciate only what they had in the first place when they are about to lose it. He told me to think about my decision. We're supposed to have another talk tomorrow. However, the preparations for my return have already started back home, it will be highly unlikely that I will change my mind.      OnceI file my resignation officially with our HR,I'm still his employee until August 31, 2004. So actually, this Friday I suddenly need to go to Malaysia again for another business trip. It kind of makes me feel sad that I shall be leaving this lifestyle soon, but then we all need to choose the path that makes us happy. I don't think people should spend their lives crying about their jobs.
