Tears welled up within her hazel eyes and her head pound with a throbbing pain.  With her whole being she felt the solitude and the isolation of being a woman.  Failure floated within her mind as she tried to come to some sort of solution.  A solution or at the very least the answer to the answer why.  Why is life treating her this way is an age old question that feels everyone's mind at least one within a lifetime.  Still this question has plagued her since the day she was born.  There was still no answer.  With her entire being she could feel the hurt and the pain.  She tried to find some sort of answer for this and yet she could not.  Of course she tried the usual journals, meditations, or even yoga.  Nothing seemed to work.  She just was not happy with her life.  But what could she do?  Change?  How?  There was no way she could change her life.  But maybe she was exaggerating everything.  Maybe she was imagining the problems and the irritations.  Maybe she was imagining the raising voice as she tried to talk about a problem.  Does it really matter?  Does it matter at all?  Maybe not.  She would stay until she wasn't needed anymore or at the very least until she was no longer sane.  That might be sooner than later.  She shrugged at that thought.
