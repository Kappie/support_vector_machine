Aside from the recently normal pain and cancer related crap, I got to leave something very dear to me as a means of self preservation. After over a year of one bastardizing slap in the face after another, it was just time. Did you ever encounter people who live for drama? Well, these people made my life like really bad community theater. There was all the name calling, reputation smudging and balls out innuendo of a good 70s camp movie. Much like a campy movie, these characters think they have a leg up or have gotten the better of you...now THAT is funny. I can just see the victory dance now - I hope it rains. BAH HAHAHAHAHAHA.  It was a day that makes you look and feel like this:    Now where is my coffee? The BEST thing to come from yesterday was the following quote I found while being frazzled from lack of clean air:  I've gone to look for myself. If I should return before I get back, keep me here.
