I tried to go to a step class at lunch, but was so stressed that I started to have a panic attack.    I have learned lately that exercise does help me stress, but when I'm starting to breakdown it does not help.  I left the class and went to visit a friend at a nearby office.  I have not given up on running.  I will try again tomorrow.    Money is the main cause of my stress.   I work a boring office job, where I am well liked and therefore make the average salary.  This however is not enough to be comfortable in Toronto on my own, when I owe $30 000 in student loans.  I have $2000 charged on my Visa and I want to visit my parents in the Fall.  They live in another part of the country and are not able to help me financially.  My immediate goal is to pay off my Visa debts and not max it out again.  I would like to at least buy my plane ticket in cash.  I've given my Visa cards (there are 2, each with a thousand dollar limit) to my best friend.  She is hiding them in her underwear drawer at home until I show her statements with zero balances.  To be able to pay them with just my present income would take a year or more, and it's even harder when I keep sneaking small purchases onto them.  So, I've decided to look for part-time work.
