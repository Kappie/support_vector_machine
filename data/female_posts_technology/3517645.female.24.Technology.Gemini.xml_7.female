The dog loves going after sticks in the water, but you have to watch him cause he tries to sneek off. He thinks he is tricky but he isn't.   Mom was telling me that there is a monument in Ottawa that has placks for everyone whos has been killed on the job and that she wants to go up and see it. I think I might mention it to Duane and see if you wants to stop on our way home from toronto. I would love to his it as well. There is one there for dad.   Dylan party is tomorrow. I have to remember to stop at toys r us to pick up his party bags for the other kids.
