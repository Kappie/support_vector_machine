I know, you're probably going to say I'm just having a rough day or something, but the truth is I have felt this way for quite some time.  From looking at and talking to me, you'd never know it.  I am considered the "social butterfly" at my place of work, who knows and talks to everyone.  I enjoy the conversations I have with people, but when it comes down to it, I would much rather spend my time alone, and I often do.  I think one of the biggest problems I have is that I have high expectations of people; that's especially true of those closest to me.  The problem with that is the fact that I frequently feel let down and disappointed because of these expectations.  Is it wrong of me to have such expectations?  Then again, is it too much to ask for people to simply be respectful and thoughtful?  In today's times, I guess it is.
