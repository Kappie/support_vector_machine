I spent a lot of my day in paid training, too, which is always nice for a change. There is a cute supervisor boy that sits near us who has shoulder length hair and that kind of "I just rolled out of bed" style. He's pretty dreamy and nice to look at while working, but I'm getting teased a little about it now... guys, I'm married, I'm not DEAD! The only bad thing about today was on my first lunch I got a bad nosebleed unexpectedly. After work we took pictures of our friend Mitchell's Jeep because Adam's mum might buy it and then Adam can over for dinner and we had spaghetti and beer. I'm really tired so I'm going to bed now, I was just playing around online and thought I'd blab here for a minute.
