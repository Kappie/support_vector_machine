Found an apartment which is huge, probably going to room w/ Aaron and Mike if it all goes through but it is not available till May.  Don't think I can wait that long.  Jammed w/ Jetless.  It kicked ass although I was sick and this whole experience will take a little getting used to, but I love it! Found out I will not have a job after the next couple of months. (getting laid off) The good news is I was offered a job for ZT Technical Services, doing the NCV's and SSEP's and Spinal/Musculoskeletal Diagnostic Ultrasounds, the bad news is I am required to travel out of state every so often and being a single mom that will be difficult to do at times.  Hopefully my family will support me on this! I wish the sperm donor would help more. Hah I have good and bad things going on right now, but like I always do, I will get through them. I just have to keep fighting and look at the positives of everything. At least I have my health ( I hope) my family and my friends, right? That is all I need! Oh yeah we can't forget about the band. LOL
