I only work four hour's a day due to my recent surgery so I was glad to get out of there today. I had a lot of laughs this morning though before I left. I wish the work day was always four hours. I hope my doctor let's me have a few more weeks on limited duty because it is still hard for me to work past five hour's. Well what will be will be. I just don't want to end up a cripple standing on my feet all day before I'm ready. Well just did the bills when I got home. Watched my HBO shows and printed some 8x10's and wrote a letter to my grown son who is unfortunately incarcerated. He has been away since he was 14 for a robbery in which no one was injured. He is 21 now with seven more years to go. This was his first offense. Before this he had started to run away from home. If he would have committed a murder he would have been out sooner. Go figure. But anyhow he's not bitter he looks at it as a blessing because he could have been killed at least he alive. Where there's life there's hope and a second chance. It's just to bad the justice system is not a fair one. If I would have had a pricey lawyer I'm sure he would have been home in a couple of year's if that. I miss him... My guy called again not much to say as usual I don't know what he wants. Our relationship as of late is he picks my little son up from school and than goes wherever he goes when he leaves. But anyhow must get ready for another one of God's days. Peace :)
