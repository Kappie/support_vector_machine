From sweater, jackets and scarves, I'm slowly peeling them off one by one.  First the scarf, then the jacket, then replace the sweater with a long-sleeve shirt. I can't wait until I can get to wear my favorite outfit: tank tops, capris and flip-flops.  Maybe the warming weather is responsible for the weekday's faster speed.  Hmmmmm....maybe.  I need to visit my family this weekend. Haven't talked to my Mom since her triumphant win as Ms. Valentine, and to my little bro Jedd in weeks!  I miss them. I think my Mom is probably  tampo  that I haven't called.    But this weather's too good for anyone to remain in a sour mood .  I'm feeling too good, are you?
