The humane society we found her at said if we did not get her spayed in 30 days, they would come take her back, and fine us $500 ! Now I come home from lunch to let her out of her kennel and walk her, then drive back to work, so essentially I don't really get a lunch.  My 3 year old son's day care told me, a few weeks ago, that they were going to start charging my son the old, toddler rate, a more expensive rate, because he has to many potty-training accidents, more than the other kids and at a later age. Next day my husband asked them to show him where in our contract we signed last September, did it say we'd pay a higher rate if not fully potty trained by a certain point, and they reversed the decision. Thank heavens.  About 2 weeks ago  , he pulled the fire alarm on our way out of his day care, and the owner had to call the police to get it turned off! Yesterday it was the going-away party for somone in the company that I barely know, but I arranged to go anyway. I convinced my husband to leave work early enough for him to pick our kids up, and I got to go out for drinks with my co workers. They had beers, I had 2 cokes, because I don't drink. I loved being able to go out with people!
