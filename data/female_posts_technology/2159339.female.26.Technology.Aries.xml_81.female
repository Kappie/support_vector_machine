On Friday afternoon I had a list of productive  creative things to accomplish this weekend but then the car broke down and taking the bus with a sewing machine/packing boxes seemed impractical. Instead: went to a Korean hostess bar, saw the midnight showing of Kal Ho Naas Ho, a 3.5 hour Bollywood epic of most outrageous proportions!!, went to dinner for brother's birthday where he announced that he'd been asked to become the news editor for the paper (it was actually the Shakespeare action figure I gave him that made the announcement...in perfect Elizabethan english), had talks with M about which one of us has to email my good friend/his ex about our little 'situation' (he decided it should be me), went to dinner for Genny's birthday where her dad and stepmom referred to us as a couple (crap!!) and made us pose for photographs together. In these photos M is smiling at the camera as I try to stab him in the head with a chopstick. Last night was spent watching the Hilton 'movie' on M's laptop (mediocre as far as pornos go), psychoanalysing each other to see who would get offended first - apparently I'm “stuck up and repressed” and he is “unbelievably superficial, tactless and has a lethal combination of a big ego with a small self-esteem”... Fortunately, we discovered that we're both dead inside as none of the insults had any impact whatsoever.   This morning was spent trying to kick him out of my house, but since he doesn't have anywhere to be and spends most of his time sleeping, it was impossible. Secretly praying that he's not trying on my underwear as I type this.
