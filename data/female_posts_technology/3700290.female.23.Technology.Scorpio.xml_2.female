Starting with the good news, Diana Ser's face was splashed over the mag cover. She is going to be Mrs Lye very soon. Looking at the pictures, James Lye and her do make a handsome pair. Indeed, couples like them in the media industry are rare gems now. They have a marathon-long relationship of 9 years before they finally decide to walk down the aisle.                                ****    And on the newspapers' headline was the Korean soldier who was held as a captive by the terrorists. He was beheaded despite his pleas. I was quite upset by the news. Perhaps if I did not watch the clips in which he has pleaded so pitifully to the terrorists to let him off, and the heartless (or should I say, thoughtless) Korean government insisted that they would dispatch more troops to assist US on air, I would not feel so much.   After reading the article, I was having mixed feelings: IF the Korean government do have the intention to save the hostage, they would not have said such things on air. It was OBVIOUS that the terrorists wanted was that the Korean government stop sending troops. On the other hand, the Korean government insisted on doing the silliest thing in mind...and that was to declare that they would not stop dispatching troops ON AIR. Oh mine, even someone with an IQ of 80 would have known that the poor captive's chance of suriving was slimmed down to zero with such bombastic announcement.   On the other hand, on a more intellectual and less emotional point of view, the government did their role. They have sticked to their promises to the US government and acted accordingly to what they have promised. At the same time, they did try to send special missionary troops over to rescue the captive. Well, on a grave note, people should know that survivial or death are just part and parcel of life. Perhaps, the demise of the Korean soldier should be viewed in such a way that his death was a patriotic act, and not just another loss of an innocent life...   Sigh...Being the ever-peacemaker, Icould not help but to think that would not it be great if there isn't any war at all? Humans should be cultivated to realise that violence(War) should not be the ultimate solution to solve problems. COMMUNICATION do it. How many lives have been robbed off in the substitution of power and material gains?
