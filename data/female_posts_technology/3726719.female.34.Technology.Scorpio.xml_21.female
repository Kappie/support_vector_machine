The reverse of that is, the moment I have some free time and would like to go out and do something, I cannot find any living person in the universe who doesn't already have plans!!!  ;o)  So this surprise evening of getting out of work before 8pm finds me eating popcorn for dinner and sitting in front of the computer.  I'm contemplating trying my hand at Texas Hold'em Poker.  Scary thought I admit.
