Cool.  Congrats on the alcohol only diet.  I'll try that next.  Maybe if I helped with the ratio of Chris in your system, not eating alcohol might seem less catastrophic:) -----Original Message----- From: Linda  Sent: Tuesday, April 20, 2004 2:07 PM To: Chris Subject: RE: Starvation Diet   The only thing  Most of what I "eat" is alcohol.  And if I were to upset the ratio of blood to alcohol in my alcohol system, that would be catastrophic.  And I only use Tom's of Maine toothpaste and mouthwash.  All natural.  :) -----Original Message----- From: Chris Sent: Tuesday, April 20, 2004 2:05 PM To: Linda Subject: RE: Starvation Diet  Because it is actually a "detoxification cleanse" that gets rid of all the pollution that you encounter in everyday life.  As time goes by, you eat foods as well as encounter chemicals in anything from makeup to toothpaste.  A toxicity builds up in your cells.  Some people, like me, are affected by that more than others.  People like you don't feel it because your system is better at processing the toxins.  But if you did this for even 10 days, you would feel a difference and have more energy.  Even things like chicken, steak and hamburgers (hormones in feed) and fruits and vegetables (pesticides) contribute.   -----Original Message----- From: Linda   Sent: Tuesday, April 20, 2004 1:54 PM To: Chris Subject: RE: Starvation Diet  If this starvation diet is so effective, why on earth would one have to do it several times a year???  -----Original Message----- From: Chris Sent: Tuesday, April 20, 2004 1:52 PM To: Linda Subject: Starvation Diet  Hey blogger.  Day 5 of the starvation diet as you call it.  Blood pressure normal - diastolic at 84 down from 136.  11 pounds weight loss.  Much better breathing but still need more improvement in the allergy department.  I am meeting someone tomorrow who does the diet several times a year and is well-educated on it, gonna ask if that technique is just as effective as 40 straight days, which seems like forever right now.     I figured with your vast experiences of being hit on that you would have found out a way to get rid of the guy at the bar who thinks he has a date in August;)
