I never figured out my role or how I fit in.. but I was a part of it..and for that I’m utter and most grateful.. here are a list of my friends sand their qualities…  Sadhi – Amazing girl who I always fought with for reasons I can’t even remember.. I remember once I called her father a chiea pet and she didn’t talk to me for 2 weeks we had an amazing love hate relationship.. when we were together we used to fight and when we were apart we would long for each other… it was odd..sadhi got all the men.. she looked great in whatever she put on..had a body of a short greek goddess… the girl was able to stop traffic… she was a little ghetto in her ways ..but I luved goin over to her place where she would cook for me… the person who I never thought I’d look up to.. now is my mentor in life…  Radha – My dad said we were made for each other .. just like our names… we fit well.. she was like the mommy and I was the baby.. I remembered whenever a little fight would break out among us usually sadhi and me.. we’d go to radha for advice.. for some odd reason I can’t seem to remember what she told us..but whatever it was .. helped… radha was like a ring master to me.. she made sure everyone was happy…he was wild and adventurous… she was the one who told me sneaking out and goin to parties was OK.  She the one who taught me how to lie to my parents.. she taught me well her teachings came into great use in college ..for that radha I will always be grateful…  Ripal – this girl was so cute.. she came in a tiny package but she could be heard for miles…she never stopped talking… and never procrastinated.. this chicka would have her school clothes planned out on the weekend..so all she had to do was put them on in the morning.. I thought that was odd. She would mix and match shirts with pants and earrings.. she was the fist girl that got me acquainted with manicures, and eye makeup.. sorry rips I stopped using eye makeup… to hard of a task to apply…I remember the birthday parties and Christmas parties we used to have at her house in her basement … sadly I don’t even remember what we did.. I remember eating and talking up a storm.. to this girl I own my shy days too.. for now one can not get me to stop talking…  Krishna Shah – other than having the same name as her.. we called this little one “SHAH”..this girl was quite brilliant ..very competitive.. never against me though I was the airhead in my group..i think they all called me “Clueless” at one point in time… it was neck and neck with this girl and radha..don’t know y…perhaps they were both extremely brilliant…miss shah..had the most interesting crush’s…she would swoon over guys while I’d be thinking about Barbie dolls… always very mature and never really acted her age…she wanted to be an adult when she ws marly a kid… I learned a lot form this girl… if u study and give it your best shot u’ll do well.. look shah .. I did well in college and have a great job.. look I’m not a slacker…I finally succeeded…  Vivek – this man…amazing he suppose to be the “PLAYER”.. “MR. HOTTIE”.. I can’t think of any desi girl who did not want to go out with him at one point in time..other than me.. remember I was never into guys till I hit puberty sophomore year of college..i know I’m a late bloomer…  Mr. Stud..here got all the girls … I’ve never seen him without one.. I once bumped into him at a club my 2nd yr of college and girls were hanging off of him like monkeys off a banana tree..he’s very sweet and charming has charisma, style, and a killer smile.. basically he’s the guy a girl would want to bring home.. NOT!!!..but over all very sweet kid that all of the above girls wanted at one point…   lucky man..no one wanted me.. pooo  See I had amazing friends growing up… hopefully I’ll get to see them all very soon…that was the last time I saw vivek since graduation and sadhi one a year ago at her wedding.. but the reast I really never saw… all I know is that I’m very grateful…thank u all for being my friend..and I’ll never forget u…muha…
