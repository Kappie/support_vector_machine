Apparently she has read my blog and I was chastised for talking about "personal things" and for opening my husband to ridicule because of my previous posts.  According to her, "it's funny but it ain't worth it".  So to offset any negative impressions I may have made on my husband by talking about his skivvies, and about his ahem-ahem, thriftiness, I have compiled a list on why I have THE BEST HUSBAND IN THE WORLD:  1. He never lets me leave without giving him a hug and a kiss. 2. He wakes up with me even though he works afternoons just so he can cook me breakfast.  3. He eats breakfast with me. 4. He makes lists to remind himself what needs to be done.  He is a list freak. Trust me. 5. He still calls me baby. 6. He lets me call him baby, honey, darling,  pappi , daddy, doofus,  sidi (prince), even weirdo. 7. He panics when he can't get a hold of me at 8 pm. sharp. 8. When he can't get a hold of me (I've cancelled my cellphone) he leaves worried messages on our phone machine. 9. He packs my lunch. 10. He offsets my need to spend with his practicality. 11. He is patient. 12. He puts up with all my foibles, whinings, poutings, unfair criticisms, delusional thinkings, insane accusations, schizophrenic episodes, and maniacal outbursts. 13. He is patient. 14. He is kind. 15. He is patient. 16. He has a kooky sense of humor. 17. We have the same sense of humor. 18. We sometimes think then say the same things at the same time. 18. He never fails to surprise me with his originality. 19. He believes you shouldn't just show your love for someone on one day like Valentine's, it should be everyday. 20. I have a compilation of letters and emails from him that prove what a poet he is. 21. He takes pleasure in the simplest things. 22. He loves the outdoors and nature.   23. He loves Asian things. 24. He loves Filipino things. 25. When he was a little boy, he told everyone he was going to marry a chinese girl.  In his culture, "chinese" encompassed all asians. 26. When he was a little boy, he took a photo of his face and superimposed it on Bruce Lee's body. 27. When he was a little boy, he kept a pair of chopsticks, as one of his prized possessions. 28. He has a blackbelt in Martial Arts. 29. I joke that he should have been born Asian. 30. He's into Tai-Chi. 31. He should have been born Asian. 32. He's patient. 33. And loving 34. And wonderful to curl up beside on cold nights, on warm nights, on any nights! 35. He's patient. 36. Did I mention that he's patient? 37. He is very handsome.  That's it for now....
