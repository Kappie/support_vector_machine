We've still got 3 movies to shoot this weekend so Saturday morning/afternoon and Sunday morning are shot.  Still I'll have a chance to hang with my east coast friends tomorrow and have a nice picnic Sunday night (hopefully).  It's hard to fit in all the fun with all the work.  Last night I was out rollerblading for two hours with Lexi after a full day of class.  We met a roller-dancer named Greg who gave us some free rollerblading lessons.  The portrayal of New York as a rude city is definitely unwarranted.  We've found most people on the street to be much more outgoing than many of the people we meet in California.  I think it has to do with the very compact nature of the city.  In San Francisco, more people drive or take the train than walk. You are usually on your way to a get together, which requires you to drive/bike or take the train.  As such, you don't have as much opportunity to mingle with everyone else on the street.  It's a refreshing change to have so many people walking around outside their personal bubbles.  It's off to Avenue Q.  So long
