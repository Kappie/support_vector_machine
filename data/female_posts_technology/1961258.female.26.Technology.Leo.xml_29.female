Or I just am eating 3 normal meals per day and because I'm not normal I can't do that. I have to go back to my protein shakes and absolutely nothing else. Will try that for dinner today. I can eat breakfast or lunch, like a normal person .. but dinner .. or after 7pm absolutely nothing.   Still have not completely phased out junk food, in fact .. it's been cropping up all over the place. I'll have one or two "cubes" of Cadbury choc (one of those huge bars, they segment it into cubes of 4x across). And maybe an ice-cream cone once every two - three days, because it's so hot. Other than that .. some kind of chewy sweet, I think .. and nothing much. No soda, besides sips. No chips, 2 weeks once perhaps.   I don't get it. Am I just destined to exercise like mad every single day? I eat such small portions compared to other people. Yeah I guess so, I need to make sure I work out every single day.   I'm trying to motivate myself by doing these 10 - 20 min segments throughout the day. Instead of allocating 45 - 60 minutes, which .. just thinking about it makes me feel so tired .. I'll do short bursts of 10 - 20 min high intensity workouts. I'll TRY to do them 2 - 3 times a day, or more .. as much as I can. I think that's a better way to go around it since it does not feel so tedious to do.   I watched Fear Factor Couples the other day and the women had THE most amazingly buff, perfect bodies. I want one of those. I don't want to be stuck as a fat woman for the rest of my life and not be able to enjoy the final days in my 20s as a 'normal' 20-ish woman. I don't like looking in the mirror and seeing my stomach .. bulge out. Or looking at my face and seeing how fat  pudgy I look. Or my thick thighs. Or my horrible upper arms. Or .. all the cellulite, stretch marks, whatever else that befalls me as a fat person.
