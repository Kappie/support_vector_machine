But I really can't be angry I knew it was coming I had more than ample time to prepare for this one, but it still hurts the paycheck when I suddenly don't get one anymore.  Unemployment line here I come ...  on the bright side - I only had to wake up at 7:30 am to move my car for street cleaning. Cool. aaand I got several errands finished. I feel very proud of myself.
