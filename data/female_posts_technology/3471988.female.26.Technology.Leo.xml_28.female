We drove for an 1 1/2 hr North of Bangalore to a resort called Club Cabana where we spent the day playing ice breaker games (language is not an issue at all - their accent takes getting used to but for the most part we understand each other), watching them fight because they keep changing the rules (where are the processes?), eating, watching the local monkey family play on the trees, eating, more ice breaker games and fighting, more eating, bowling to sappy love songs from the 80s/90s, and then of course ending our day with a late afternoon chai tea.  Oh my god...South Indian food is so yummy! Its definitely nothing like the Indian food we find in the States. This IS more spicy, more flavorful but less rich and more sharp in taste. I will like this very much!
