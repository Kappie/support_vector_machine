Really struggled thro the day and closed the doors finally in the evening. A person like me, who hates to hit the bed before 10, fell asleep at 8:30, man, this must have been history in the making!  Anyway, the day as a whole was quite depressing, hardly was able to conquer my hurt  pain and the headache and body ache kindof added that extra dimension to the misery. In all, one seriously depressing day in my life..coz I felt emptiness at the very max today.  I have always wondered what it would be to be marooned on an island and have to live a few days there.It kindof feels to be a good thing...maybe a few days of solitude will help me forget these unanswered questions and move on with life?? I dont know really, but then the more I think about it, I doubt I will ever get answers to my questions.  The only good news I got for the day was my close friend from Dubai was getting hitched finally, to her senior from Philly..and to top things off, she's getting married two days after her bro..and the wedding is at chennai. So I guess it's gonna be party time in teh 3rd week of August for me...four days of fun and frolic! I just hope the marriage blues will leave me by that time...:)
