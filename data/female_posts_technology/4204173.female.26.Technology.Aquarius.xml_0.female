But, I am attempting to keep the carbs below 80g net per day. I am also counting calories, too, because I know from experience that calories DO count. So what have I eaten today so far?  Breakfast: 3/4 cup cereal, 1/2 cup skim milk  Lunch: 2 Sausage Patties, 2 slices reduced-calorie whole wheat bread  Snacks: 1 orange, 1 oz. of dry-roasted peanuts, 1 container of fat-free yogurt.  Dinner: 4 oz. turkey breast, 1/2 cup of mashed potatoes, green beans and 1/2 cup turkey gravy.  Total Calories: 1140(Yikes!) Total Net Carbs: 78g  I need to get off my lazy ass and exercise. But this blogging is oddly addictive.  On a personal note, my husband Gary runs a small golf course in our town. He leases the land from one of the local business owners, who informed him today that he was putting the land up for sale in a couple of weeks. He is asking $500,000 for it and wondered if we'd be interested in buying it. Oh, yeah, we've got that money in our back pocket, mother fucker! So it looks as though Gary will be on the job hunt in the near future. In a way, I'm glad--he spent entirely too much time there and now he can be home with me more, but, he really loves what he does and I hate to see that taken from him. More to come in the future.......
