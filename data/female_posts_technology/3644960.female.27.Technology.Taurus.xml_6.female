Reminds me very much of "Pope Joan" which is one of my all time favorite novels.  Word to the wise though, if you're going to purchase this book, spend a few extra bucks and get the hard cover. The softcover is one of those short and thick "beach" novels that aren't very comfortable to read!   Update: I can't put this book down! I'm completely engrossed in the story, I honestly feel as if I'm watching a wonderful movie in my head!   " As a new age dawns in England's twelfth century, the building of a mighty Gothic cathedral sets the stage for a story of intrigue and power, revenge and betrayal. " - Book Description    urlLink Icewind Dale Trilogy  by R. A. Salvatore  I might never get to read this book! I made the mistake of introducing my husband to the Dark Elf books, and while I was suffering through 'Le Mariage' he was thoroughly enjoying 'The Dark Elf Trilogy'. Now he's reading 'Icewind Dale Trilogy' so I have to wait until he finishes before I can begin. And with over 1500 pages, that could be awhile... Oh well, it's worth it to have turned another person on to this series.  " Icewind Dale. Windswept passes and forbidding glaciers stand at the top of the world. Below them, in the cold valleys, an evil force broods: the magic of Crenshinibon, the crystal shard.       Now dwarf, barbarian, and drow elf join to battle this evil. Tempered in the furnace of struggle, they form an unbreakable friendship.       A legend is born. " - Book Description    urlLink The Descent  by Jeff Long  This is our bookclub selection for the month of August. I'm definitely excited to read this book, sounds right up my alley!  " Long's smart and epic tale takes the reader into a Dantesque world, a journey to the center of the earth for the new millennium. And what is found there is both horrific and entrancing: a system of tunnels that network beneath the earth, and homonid relatives of Homo sapiens evolved to live in the depths of what appears to be hell. " - Baltimore Sun    urlLink Legacy of the Drow  by R. A. Salvatore  " The Legacy of the Drow Collector's Edition brings together four bestselling novels: The Legacy, Starless Night, Siege of Darkness, and Passage to Dawn. The adventure begins in seeming serenity as we find Drizzt Do'Urden enjoying a rare state of peace. But he did not arrive at this station without leaving powerful enemies in his wake. Lolth, the dreaded Spider Queen deity of the evil Dark Elves, counts herself among these enemies and has vowed to end the drow's idyllic days. Thus begins a severe and lasting chain of events that make these collected Forgotten Realms novels unforgettable reads. " - Book Description
