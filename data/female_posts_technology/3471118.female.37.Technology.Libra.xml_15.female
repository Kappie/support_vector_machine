He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. 46 If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? 47 And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? 48 Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.   This makes a lot of sense to me. It's easy to love the people who love you, anyone can do that.  It's a lot harder to show love to people who hate you, or who you hate. Doing that is what really shows that you are the kind of Christian who can be an example to other people, because it is so hard to do and so against our human nature and instinct. But doing that will show other people what it really means to be a Christian -- far more than the fire and brimstone condemnation of everyone who isn't a Christian that so many "Christians" demonstrate to the world.  We'll never be able to reach that level of perfection that is the standard set for us, but that doesn't mean we can't try for it.
