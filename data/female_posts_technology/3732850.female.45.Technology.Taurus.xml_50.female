I remember there was a tree that had fallen across that river and I would walk and sit there for a long time.  I feel like there was a spot just for me because on that tree that fell across that river, it had another part of a tree branching upward.  This is what I considered to be my private spot and this tree had a built in chair for me, so it seemed.  That is how I pictured it.  I went there everyday during the summer.  The grass was so green.  There were also outhouses so I wouldn't need to go home to use the bathroom.  There were trees with names carved into them.  One had the shape of a heart with someones initials abbreviated inside that heart.  There were picnic tables.  Those also had abbreviations or initials in them as well.  We would have our last day of Sunday School at this park in Gonvick, Minnesota.  We would have teachers bring bars or we would pack a lunch, if we liked.  We played games and I remember someone falling into the river.  I don't remember exactly who it was but he/she was completely drenched from his head to his/her toes.        I went there to the park for Sunday School and Vacation Bible School Settings.  Sometimes as the child and sometimes as the Teacher.  I think I taught Sunday School for three years and I also helped with Vacation Bible School for two years.  We played games and ate lots of food.     I think this place I found to be safe for me in my life and I also have a lot of enjoyable memories.  I remember going there also with my brother and sister.  We would be running through the culvert because, at times, there wasn't much water so we would start running and swaying and moving from side to side so we wouldn't get wet by the water.  We would just keep having fun going back and forth from one end of the culvert to the other.  We weren't the only ones who did this because I remember the graffiti inside that culvert.       My brother, Dennis, would go fishing there during the summer and we'd tag along, my sister, Jane and I.  I spent a great deal of summer with a friend.  Her name was Sherry. We would also go there a lot and sometimes we would fall in.  I remember one time the water was going pretty rapidly and I didn't think nothing of it at the time but we could have drowned.  Boy, I don't know if my Mom knows about that to this day.      I think the existance for this essay is that I found this place comfortable and convenient for me.  I would go down there and sometimes walk along the river to see where it led to.  I was gone for a long time.  It took me about two hours just to walk the one way of the river because I would find or spot some interesting things.  I thought of having a place where I would build a fort but that never happened.  I only imagined it.      It's sad to say, but I think this was a hiding spot for me, away from my dad when he was drinking.  I'd get tired of the arguing and fighting so this is where I would always go for hours.  I also believe Sunday School is another Safe Haven place I found to be and I enjoyed the songs.  Sometimes, I would sit on that tree and remember a song from church and sing.  One of those songs, that I remember, is: "What a Friend we Have in Jesus."  I also feel this was something I'd like to say was my thinking grounds.  I found peace and serenity in these surroundings.
