Anyhoo, my boss made a compliment today: "It'll be a challenge but with you leading the charge I'm sure things will go smooth." That made my day.   My reply was "Should I go Hitler now or wait until everyone returns from vacation?"  She told me to wait.   Moral of the story: There's a new Hitler in town and she ain't blonde blue-eyed. Goes by the name of BITCH.
