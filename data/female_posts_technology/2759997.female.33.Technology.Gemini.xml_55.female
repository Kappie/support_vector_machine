I can deal with them going down in the first round (and we know they've certainly done that in the past), but knowing that they weren't good enough to go was too much.  I could have used ONE good thing in my life...  Congrats to UConn - they were my pick.  And even better that they eliminated Duke -- and the  urlLink team that beat IU  in the only game I've seen in 10 years...  There's always next year.   urlLink Maybe we'll get a new coach.  :)
