("you remember your cousin, joe, don't you? joe? your cousin? i was his best friend.") and then somehow the fact i got a 99 percentile on the psat came up and he was just FLOORED. ("oh! i didn't know you were smart. wow! i can't believe YOU got a higher score than ME. etc, etc, etc.) he just thinks so highly of himself, it's unfuckingbelievable. i hate people with his characteristics. normally, i respect artists. it's definitely not easy making a short film or making music or writing... lord knows i can't do it... but i can't respect him. he reminds me of someone else i hate... stan. fuck stan, too. mel's making the biggest mistake of her fucking life. it's too bad she's too stupid to see it.      i'm so sick of dealing with the majority of people. i wish i could live out in bumblefuck somewhere. it's too bad i would miss korean food... and just the option of going out, even if i don't feel like it. heh...       anyway, thank god it's hump day. wish it was friday, though....
