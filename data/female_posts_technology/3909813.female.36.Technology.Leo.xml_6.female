The dishwasher is running and humming along, the dog is barking next door, as I click, click, click faster than I can read. Today was a good day, good sleep last night, sleepy morning, puttered most of the day with my Baby Girl. Registered for school, etc., am excited about that. Family is out shopping for me, it is my birthday, one week from today. I will be 36 and I am so glad I am here every day with my beautiful family. The remainder of this week will be full of final preparations for next. Then it all begins, my favorite time of year, fall, August/September and the lot until 2005.  How do I feel today, I feel good, my skin is brokeout which makes me frown, and am still toooo voluptuous for my own good, but that will come. My son is still seething from the day before of blowups.  I am still recovering from the trauma of having two incompetent, alcoholic, chemically dependent parents who won't stop trying to inflict pain and torture their children, but for the most part they can't hurt me any more.  This week I would like to say goodbye in my own way to the summer, and hello to the next act. I want to find good ways to nurture my little girl inside and cherish her. Not sure how yet, but that would be a definite goal.  I want to start being more romantic and caring to my love, and cherish "US."  For some reason that seems so hard.  I feel unworthy sometimes, I am sure he does too.
