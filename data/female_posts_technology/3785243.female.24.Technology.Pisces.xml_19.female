I have today to enjoy as "vacation", then I'm back at school tomorrow for the second summer semester, Developmental Psychology.  This should be a pretty cool class, learning about how little kids and adolescents work.  I know enough people who are still mentally teenager(s), that some of the concepts will apply to adults as well.  ;-)  I have a fun little sideproject going right now that is keeping me entertained.  I have adopted an elderly circa 1987 Macintosh SE.  It is currently in the process of being connected to the internet.  One might ask why you would want to put a 17 year old machine on the internet, but I say why not?  I love the style of the Classic Macintoshes (the "cute" Macs most of us probably remember), and it makes me sad to see old computers abandoned.    -- Aeryth
