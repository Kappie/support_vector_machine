I’m always thinking or worried about something or someone ..but this weekend I wanted to be selfish and take care of myself…on Saturday I went to the gym ..and then hit the park with my sister…I parked the car under a tree and opened all the windows and read .. yah u got it I read for about 2 hours straight ..it was great…the cool breeze getting tangled within my hair ..and the soft chirping of baby birds in the trees above…it was the most amazing feeling ..it was just me and the world… I think I’m going to do this every weekend .. I enjoy it thoroughly ..plus it’s about time I manage my time usefully… On Sunday…I decided to go shopping I had a whole list of things to get…however when I hit the store all the items on my list appeared to be beyond ugly on the display shelf…so I ended up coming home with 2 disc-mans…one for me and another for my brother… during my time at the store my buddy C-man called about 2 to 3 times … he was having issues picking out presents for his parents… I guess I know where he’s coming from I never know what to get my parents … at times old people have such complicated taste ..or else very high expectations… to top of my wonderful weekend Doctor P called and he quizzed me on my sports teams and the cities they were from ..i’m not really a huge baseball, football, basketball, or hockey fan ..but I was surprised that I knew so many teams from all sorts of cities… I think Doctor P was a bit surprised at my sports trivial knowledge…soon after Doctor P and I started practicing my guju in a very unusual manner… My gujarati sucks.. I speak so poorly and have no idea how to conjugate verbs… I think the Doctor got a good laugh listening to me sound like an *ss but hey .. at least I’m trying to get better…I’m excited today Dr. P and I are going to go over colors and fruits in guju…yippie… mu thanna maaru?…    Question of the Day…   If you can bite anyone anywhere where would u bite them…?   I would bite someone on their shoulder it’s the perfect shape ..it will fit perfectly in one’s mouth once they open their jaws very wide…so u all out there wear extra shoulder pads ..cuz I might just bite u…yummy…
