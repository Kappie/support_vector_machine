She was 50 yrs. old, had just recently married, and has a 10 yr. old son. I'm having a hard time processing this ... and I'm pissed off at her for doing this to her son. She has sentenced him to a life of emotional hell. Why didn't she call me, or one of her other friends, when she had the gun to her head? Why didn't she look at me and say "I can make it through this thing" (I am a cancer survivor)? Instead she pulled the trigger. Now she's gone forever.And her son doesn't have a mommy. Suicide is a permanent solution to temporary problems. Rest in peace my friend, because we won't.  Just when I thought this was the lowest point, I heard that my ex-boyfriend was killed in a car accident along with his wife  one of his kids. He leaves behind a son whom he was very close to. This guy was the salt of the earth. He was the most polite  respectful person I've ever met. He use to leave me love notes on my car windshield every day. His greatest wish in life? To be a father. And I bet he was a damn good one, too. It is such a shame that a great person like him died so young. The world needed him ..... so did his son.  I promise my next blog entry will not be so much of a downer. >^..^
