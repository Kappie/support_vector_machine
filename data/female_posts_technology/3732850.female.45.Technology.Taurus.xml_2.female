I remember Tracy when she was a little girl and she gave up her bed for me when she was about 5 years old. She has grown up and became a wonderful mother to my first great-grandson and the great-granddaughter she named after me. I hope that they enjoy it here in California. This is her first time here and the first time she will always remember me, she has told me that all she remembers about me is that if she was sleeping on the couch that meant grandma was coming.   I hope that I stay healthy enough to visit, because this will probably be her only chance to see me again. I haven’t been feeling well lately so I hope the memories will always be with my granddaughter and great grandchildren. This was the best birthday gift I could ever receive. Now, I got to see my first great-grandson and boy is he a great kid she’s doing a great job and my great granddaughter that is named after me and her grandma’s middle name. Tracy told me if she knew my middle name she would have named Laura completely after me, but I told her that her mother’s middle name Marie was nice too and that was a good combination.   I seen them off today they are going to Disney Land and then the next day they are flying back home. I hope her stay was great, I know it was great seeing her all grown up and she got to meet her cousins for the very first time. I can’t believe my eyes on how much my grandkids have grown and Tracy with a family. Things seem to be going good with Tracy she has found a good man and she and the kids seem like they have survived the divorce well. I hope she knows how much I love her and proud of her. I hope the memories will stick with the great-grandkids. On July 7th I passed away and I was happy to meet my great-grandkids and see my granddaughter all grown up with her little family. I can go in peace knowing that she is finally happy and I got the chance to see her and the kids.
