I should get him something this year, now that we're friends. I know this because he doesn't make puking noises when I hug him good-bye anymore. I think he has fogiven me for that razor blade accident 13 years ago and I have forgiven him for being 20 months younger, which for some time meant that I had to cook and do dishes while he played video games.    G  I had virtually the same experience growing up, down to our ceremonious induction into the communist party and our obsession with the World Wrestling Federation, but have turned out quiet differently. While he has the ability to hold calm conversations with my father about his Future, I throw my hands up after 15 seconds and storm out of the house. While he can tell you 25 reasons why Shakespeare is the most brilliant writer in history, I am often bored by things I have to struggle to understand. So while mom  dad party it up russian style on Thanksgiving this Thursday, G  I will be sharing Stove Top and working on his article for the paper. He told me to not expect to have any fun.
