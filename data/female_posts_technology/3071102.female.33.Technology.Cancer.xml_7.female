AND CHOIR DRAMA CONTINUES  You know that you have had a bad day when the first thing that you want when you step into the door is a drink (of the adult kind) and a cigarrette (esp when you generally smoke when you are 3 sheets to the wind). Don't you hate it when you start your day out by being late? It's not enough that you are awakened out of slumber by whatever noise, light, cat leaping on top of you, etc... but then you realize that the clock somehow doesn't seem right.  And what I mean by right is correct... it seems to be reading at a different hour than you normally awaken.  And then, in the next 15 seconds, it clicks... because the light coming in your window doesn't look quite correct, and you know you feel a little too well rested... and then you realize why you were dreaming about being trapped in a house when you so desperately needed to be somewhere and your ex-boyfriend was there thwarting you, teasing you, making you linger because you are wandering what the fuck he is doing there in your dream in the first place!  Of course, the dream is bad enough.  But then you get into traffic.  Traffic of the variety that you are NOT accustomed to contend with... which is why you generally wake up EARLY. Ok, so you have your coffee, because at least the coffee pot woke up when it was supposed to and produced it's magical brew.  You have tunes... but you are in a rental car, and you don't have the exact variety that you are accustomed to, and you know it's going to be a long commute. However, it's still early, there is time to be optimistic based on the rate of speed that you are going and how much ground that you are covering. And then, you hit the traffic wall. That moment, when you realize that it's NOT going to get better...no, in fact, it's going to get WORSE!  and it does, and all that you can do is sip at the remainder of your coffee, try to stab at the buttons on the stereo and distract yourself.  "With acceptance, comes peace" So, you've accepted, you've come to some sort of peace with yourself... and then you get to work. An entire other set of issues to deal with, personalities, explanations as to why you are late... phrasing it so that you don't look so idiotic... because you feel kind of bad.  I mean, we all get upset when someone is perpetually late... or it happens on a really BAD morning for lateness, etc.  but then we do it, you do it, and you can't help but feel a little twinge. And then, "with acceptance comes peace" You know, and please tell me if I am wrong... but when you are late to work so early in the morning... the groove is gone before it gets there, you know what I mean?  Oh!  and the choir drama continues... The day before yesterday as you know, there was an emergency meeting for the choir to decide how to proceed as our choir director was clearly overmedicated for his problem with depression. Oddly enough, the choir members present (can't say I was there... too much drama for me) decided to split under another director.  (which I completely agree with) All of this was cool, great!  We were going to meet at another location even. And then we all received the expected goodbye email from the old, depressed, overmedicated, director. And then another letter from the same... By the third, I was done. Or, so I thought.  Because of course there were replies from members of the choir, some derogatory, some not... The not was either chastising the members that had been derogatory, or aplauding other choir members for coming "clean" about their depression, and applauding them for it. No offense, I do aplaud these individuals for dealing with their emotional issues.... but I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT!!!!!!!!!!!!! If this is bitchy, then call me a bitch.  But I barely know these people, so please!
