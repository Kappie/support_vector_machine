I've gotten about halfway through it.  The hardest part is barely dented though.  I got home around 5.  Surprisingly the roomie was there.  He went to Atlanta with the other docs for a conference/seminar thing.  Evidently they were bored so they came back home after about 1 hour.  Which meant the roomie was bored.  We hung out and chatted a bit.  When I went to get ready for my Saturday evening date, he went to the liquor store.  :D   Yep - pina coladas baby!!   His was a good attempt...they were nowhere near as good as mine.  So before I left, I made another pitcher to get him through the evening!  My date Saturday evening was with Mr. B.  He's the one I had coffee with last weekend.  We met at Opry Mills to catch dinner and a movie.  Planning didn't work out for a dinner at Macaroni Grill, and that turned out to be okay.  With the Titan's playing the first pre-season game, I suggested eating at Jillian's so we could chat and keep tabs on the game.  And of course with the pina coladas started before I left the house, I kept Mr. B well entertained.  We had some time to kill between dinner and the movie, so we did a little walking around.  He wanted to check out Tower records for something he's been looking for, and ended up buying me a CD.  It's by Jem - an artist you can hear on 100.1 Lightening 100.  It's awesome.  His reasoning was that since he didn't buy me flowers, the least he could do was buy me a CD.  It was very sweet actually.  And a smart move on his part - whenever I listen to I have a thought of him.  So here's the embarrassing part - two mature 30 somethings went to see the movie Harold  Kumar Go To Whitecastle!!  :o)   It was completely stupid hillarious!!   Guys will love it.  Not mentally challenging by any means.  I did love Neal Patrick Harris in it though - boy has Doogie Howser grown up!!  After the movie B walked me to my car, and I drove him to his.   We talked a bit and I got a very nice couple of kisses.    It's a bit disarming to spend time with a real man that is a real gentleman.  B is definitely someone I want to spend more time with.   I got back home about 11:30 - the house was lit up like a Christmas Tree!!  The roomie had gone to Krogers and was cooking up some shrimp and basically turning my kitchen into a disaster area!!   That's the last time I leave him unattended with a pitcher of pina coladas!!  It's fun to hang out with a cool friend after a cool date....except for the part where he kept asking me about the movie....like 10 times!!!!  :D  Rumor has it he has tickets to the Titan's game next weekend and is going to take me.  We'll see if he remembers that part.
