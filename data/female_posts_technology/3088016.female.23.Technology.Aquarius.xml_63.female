We had stopped at a break point (which occur every 10-15 miles) to get water and food.  There was a group of kids there selling homemade pastries for their local 4H club.  I purchased two baggies of brownies - one to eat then, and another to eat after the finish line.  Just after we took this photo, everyone started herding toward the other side of the building and all we could hear people saying was "Bees!"  A huge swarm of bees gathered around the handlebars of one girl's bike, so thick that you could no longer tell that the handles were curved.  She had apparently eaten something sweet that had gotten onto her bike.  Thank God they didn't like brownies.   urlLink
