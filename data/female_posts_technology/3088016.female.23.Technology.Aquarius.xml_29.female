    
       Today is National Blame Someone Else Day.  In my  urlLink Toastmasters  group, this was the theme of the meeting, and the word of the day was Blamestorming - one of my sniglets from a few days ago.    In observance of National Blame Someone Else Day, I am pointedly blaming everyone in my household for moving my USB keychain drive from the computer.  Actually, I am determined that I didn't move it myself, so I believe the distribution of blame to be appropriate.  Looks like no one can ever say I don't observe holidays.   This reminds me - it's a big transition here, but follow me - of my boyfriend, Wayne, having his birthday fall on Martin Luther King day this year.  As a part of his employee development plan, he had committed to being more active about diversity.  He kept talking about taking his birthday off and taking it as a diversity day to get paid for it.  I told him that bad karma would come back to get him for something like that, but I had to admit it was pretty funny.
