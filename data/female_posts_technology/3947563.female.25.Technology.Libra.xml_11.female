Their lack of support is disheartening considering they should both be doing this as well. Let's keep them out of it as much as possible.   My week was quite successful and I was proud of myself. I made good snaking options - fruit, cheese, veggies. This weekend however was a complete disaster. I had way to much to drink on Friday night (didn't eat to much bad stuff except the chocolate cupcake) but Saturday was a write off. Started with McDonalds breakfast to try and cure the upset stomach, ended in chips and licorice! Sunday was better, stirfry for dinner and thin crust pizza for lunch.   I've really taken your dedication and motivation to heart especially what Heather's man said. I'm not going to do all this work this month and have it not result in anything. So this week I'm going to be focused. I had bran flakes for breakfast, today I had salad and calamari for lunch. I'll be having a light dinner - probably more salad with some almonds and fruit for snack.   I'm going to go for a run after work as well. This is my week to really do well. I'm counting on you all to help me through it!   My Workout Plan:   Today 30 minute run  Tomorrow: 30 minute run or eliptical and 30 min weights  Wednesday: 30 minute bike or run and 30 min weights  Friday: 30 minutes of ? 30 minute weights  Saturday: 30 minute cardio - perhaps hike?   After a disastrous weekend I'm really looking forward to proving myself this week. I know I can do it. It's just a matter of reminding myself when I see something I shouldn't eat that it will not only add fat to my diet but it very unhealthy in other ways (preservatives etc).   Ok girls....here I go!
