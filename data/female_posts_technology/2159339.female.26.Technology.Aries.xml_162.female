You stepped on my foot you rude ruffian! I wonder when I take off my shoes later if I'll have dangling toenails or missing ones that I'll have to look in my shoes for... The crowd is really jostly tonight! Oof! Their bass player is cute. He reminds me of Henry Thomas from E.T... Their singer has a similar style to Kelly Osbourne. Or is it the other way around? Ouch! Oof! With the rowdiness of this crowd, I better keep my mouth closed because I might get bumped and accidentally bite off my tongue.... Ohmilord, are they actually doing "pass-the-dude" at Bottom of the Hill?!! Wait, are they passing him to ME? No, that way! That way, people!    =   ?
