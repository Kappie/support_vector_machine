I'm getting excited about the baking this year though, I'm thinking biscotti and gingerbread.  Although people have already professed their dislike of the gingerbread, even though I'm convinced they ate it last year without knowing what it was.  I'm going to attempt the fudge again, the chocolate one comes out great, but the white chocolate one is always a disaster, I don't know why, must be something to do with the cocoa solids distribution. It's a fine line, I'm sure.  I love the minutiae of cooking!   It's LisaMisa's Christmas extravaganza part-ay this Friday, I've invited all sorts of extranneous people to it. She's so cool and is getting excited about it, but now I'm having second thoughts.   It's that whole party/conversation thing, what happens if they show up and they don't know anyone? And they just stand there, thinking 'why have I come here?'.  And then I'll feel compelled to talk to them the whole night, while the other people who've come and are thinking the exact same thing are also standing there going 'well, this was a complete waste of time, how lame'.  And I'm already trying to think of things everyone has in common and maybe trying to mix and match the people, but then realising that they're all completely different and probably won't be able to stand each other. And then no-one will ever talk to me again.  I really dislike parties.  The toilet better be free a lot of the night, so I can hide in there.
