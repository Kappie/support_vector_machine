Her hazel eyes sparkled with a warmth that normally isn't there.  Her flowed down her back with a bright reddish sheen in the candlelight.  She wasn't really looking at herself but through the mirror into a world long ago.    Her warrior.  A man filled with vitality and strength but also a loving hand.  He could kiss the thoughts right out of her mind.  She yearned still for his touch, his kiss, the feel of his body against hers.  She remembered the last time.  It was so filled with passion and love that the room smelled of it for days afterwards.   She wished he never had left her.  Now she would forever be warmed only be memories but still be cold from his lack of touch.  She laid the brush down slowly.  she covered her face with her hands and wept.  Never would she love again for she had known love and nothing else could ever compare.  All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003
