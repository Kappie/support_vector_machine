I had to read it to my husband you would think he would say something, NO!! He didn't, you would think that would of made him say hey I'm sorry that you would need a wife. I will start helping out, but No!!   A lotof women can sympathize with Judy some women have husbands that seem to take us for granted and don't understand what we really go though. We work harder then we do in the workforce, we sometimes work or even go to school and they still expect us to do everything. I think we should have this put into a poster to have hanging where our men can see it so they can be reminded how much we do for them.
