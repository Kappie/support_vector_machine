We’ve done all right I guess (and by all right I mean I haven’t eaten him and he gets food) but he’s got issues and they are many and vast. Here’s how our conversations go: Cat: (whining) You scare me. When’s the good one coming back? Me: What is wrong with you? You’ve got food, see? And water. Have a drink of water, it’ll make you feel better. Cat: (whining) I don’t like you. You won’t let me play in the basement or go in your room. Not that I’d want to go in there anyway, it smells like you and I don’t like you. When’s the good one coming back? Me: Shut up. You have no concept of time. All you know is now, then and forever. She’s coming back in forever. Now go outside and stare at the chickens next door.  Cat: (whining) Crazy, bovine bitch.  And on another day:  Cat: (whining) God, you again. You’re always here. Where’d the good one go? Me: Why am I hearing you? You don’t like me, remember? It’s a shame about the no thumbs thing,  really . That’s got to suck. Cat: (whining) If the good one ever comes back I’m going to tell her about how all you ever do is push around the noisy monster, sucking up all the lovely hair I’ve so graciously placed all over every square inch of this place. And it hurts my ears. Me: Hey rabies, I can’t hear the TV over you. Run along and stalk something. Or maybe you’d like to help me vacuum? Don’t make me get the vacuum out.  And yet another day.  Cat: (whining) Hey, I thought I heard the good one! Is she back? She isn’t. What did you do to her? I know it was you that made her go away. You are evil and off-putting.   Me: Christ on a raft rat boy I swear she’s coming back! Did I ever tell you I’m really glad she figured out a way to keep you from dragging your kills into the house? Yeah,  she  did that. The one you think is your god.  She  ruined all your little plans of taunting and maiming your prey on the hardwood floors. Come to think of it, she is kind of a god for putting that to a stop. Cat: (whining) I lounge on your computer when you aren’t here. I get my cooties  alllll  over it and you can’t stop me. Me: Oh  somebody  woke up cranky from his 18-hour nap.  Cat: (whining) Someday my kind will once again rule this world and then you’ll pay. Me: Dream on rat boy.  Vicky sent me the coolest haiku about cats but I can’t find it. I know I have it at home. I’ll add it later.    Ok, I couldn't find the haiku. Why would I delete it? It was really good. Anyway, have one more exchange I forgot about in its place. Cat: Hey satan, it's hotter than the sun in here. It's hotter than outside in here. The good one keeps it nice and cool. See how I'm covered in hair? I'm hot and I don't like you. Me: The one you're not a big scaredy pants about keeps it like a meat locker in here. I like it hot. I'm satan, it reminds me of home. Why don't you go outside and lie in the red clay for a while? Then come back inside and rub it all over everything. That's always fun and it will cool you right down. Cat: I'm not afraid of you. If I felt like it I could steal your breath while you sleep. Me: Sure you could, if you had  thumbs  to open my door with. Say, I know what will cool you off. Where's my water pistols?
