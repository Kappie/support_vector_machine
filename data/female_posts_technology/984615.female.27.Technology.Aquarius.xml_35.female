I am envious and spiteful about the fact that "he" has national acclaim as an artist and writer and general former of a "new" zeigeist for the "x-generation." Thankfully though I have NO reason to be jealous. He is humble and he is  urlLink very philantropic .   of course its always easier to be nobel when you have money.   But I will say this. He is a  urlLink fucking awsome writer .   **edit...I had to edit  urlLink this dialouge . For Truth in advertising's sake...that and to prove to the world that I have to be the biggest drunken dork there is in the Bay Area.
