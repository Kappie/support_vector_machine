Well last night we attended a show that my daughter was in and she was fabulous, which also meant that we had to be in the same room with the ex and his live in squeeze and his mother. Well, it was ok, all in all, don't get me wrong we can both talk about a few things now, where we couldn't before.  We get along ok, but this is not the type of relationship in which we would get together (both couples) and have dinner, or even sit together on the bleachers to support our children.  We are on opposite sides of the room for most events.  Strange it is to me, I would like to at least be civil enough to sit somewhat close to each other, but kind of not really.  I mean, the tension, it is still soooo thick.  At least now he is at the stage in which he responds to a hello with a hey.  It used to be silence when I said hello.  To me that is crazy.  Interesting enough his new squeeze won't talk to me either, she has never had a face to face conversation with me, only brief necessaries during phone calls, etc.  It seems she avoids that at all costs.  He comes to the door to pick up my daughter, I don't know what it is, but won't say hello to my new husband. Last night, after the event we were leaving, and I walked by the group with ex and his new family and the new squeeze stood behind him as he walked up to talk to me, and I confirmed when he would drop my daughter off in the morning, and he said, yeah, just like always, and I said ok, goodbye.  So the new squeeze stayed behind my ex and never moved.  Interesting I say.  Why is this the case?  1.  Why won't my ex's (new squeeze) even come close to me? 2.  Why if my ex is sooo "over" me why doesn't he at least behave in a civil manner? 3.  Why can't we sit together, and be somewhat civil? 4.  Why does the fairly odd ex mother in law hate me?  Blah.  Would love comments.
