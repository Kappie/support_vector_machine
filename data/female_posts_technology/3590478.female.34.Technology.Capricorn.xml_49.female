A list of the worst 10 movies I’ve seen and could remember at this very moment. I’d love to “review” dirty dancing, top gun or ghost but there is no way I’m sitting through them. Most of the movies I’ve listed probably made tons of money so clearly my opinions are addled.   10.) Any Police academy movie (or actually any movie at all) with Steve Guttenberg. According to the Simpson’s he only became famous because of the masons which makes way more sense than my “sold his soul to the devil” theory. I imagine “cocoon” and “3 men and a baby” are playing 24 hours a day, back to back in the movie theatre in hell. And on the weekends they show  “short circuit”, “it takes two” and, of course, the police academy movies because, well, it’s hell.  9.) Far and away. I want to know who was hopped up on crack and handing out blowjobs so that this pile of horror could get greenlighted. I knew it was a bad idea but still, somehow got forced to sit through it. Nicole Kidman has since redeemed herself and has been moved off the list but Tom Cruise? Yeah,  no . I thought their accents were the worst thing about this, until the sex scenes came along. Nicole may be a good actress but even she couldn’t convince me she was enjoying being pawed by monkey boy.  8.) Jerry Maguire.  Please refer to my football rant for this review.(Posted 01-24-04)  7.) Space Balls. Mel Brooks, ”Say, I think I can mock this Star wars thing the kids are all about these days! I’ll get the kiddie audience sucked in, to go along with my geriatric following. Now, whom can I hire? Who’s hip and happening? I know! Some of those punks from the SCTV, fruity Canadians, the kids love them. And Joan Rivers! The kids go wild for her potty mouth. And by potty mouth I mean she opens her mouth and screeches like a chicken spotting a bug. I’m so smart, I’ll make a bazillion dollars. Never mind that the Star wars ship sailed 7 years ago and children have the attention span of....children, they’ll love me!”  6.) Full House. Yeah, I know it’s a TV show, not a movie, shut up. It’s bad. Usually little children are cute. Not this bunch. The Olsen twins were trolls (even my mother referred to the show as “the monkey baby show”) and the other 2 kids were well on their way to anorexic prostitution and drug habits. Bog Saget is the TV version of Steve Guttenberg and the other dude in the Hawaiian shirts was like a scary clown sans makeup. The only good thing about that show was John Stamos. But 1 mulleted stud cannot cancel out the horror of troll babies, crackhead preteens, evil buffoons or the slumming version of Steve Guttenberg.  5.) Coyote Ugly. This movie was a gyp. The women jump around as if they’re naked, slinging booze all over everybody, shaking their bottoms in peoples faces and reading their lines off of cue cards large enough that you can actually see the shadow of them at the edge of the screen. Problem is, they  aren’t  naked. Maybe the actual experience of attending the bar is better, I wouldn’t know. I’ve never been able to sucker anyone into taking me. Rent real porn, it’s got the naked.  4.) Lost and Delirious. I saw this at a film festival when it was called something else. I guess they figured if they changed the name they could trick all the people who saw it at film festivals into paying to see it again. And they needed to trick us because I could hardly keep from making that choking, gurgling sound all during the movie. When I wasn’t gagging I was resting my eyes. Pretentious piece of coming out fairy tale. Oh and hey, the main “beautiful, tortured youth” was also in Coyote Ugly. Go rent real lesbian porn.  3.) Laurel Canyon. I saw this at the Edinburgh film festival last summer. I almost couldn’t include it here because I only saw three fourths of it. Yes, I had to walk out before it was over. I guess the fact that it’s an independent film was what attracted Christian Bale, Kate Beckinsale and Frances McDormand to it. “Look at me, I’m making an art film!” I think the theme was “my mom’s still a wacky hippie and I’m her uptight, upright son. How ever will we get along? Let me get my yuppie girlfriend and move in with mom.” Mayhem ensues. Except mayhem does not ensue. Naptime ensues.  Here’s a funny after note. On the plane back from Scotland I’d just explained how this was the only movie I saw there that sucked to the seemly interested (and by interested I mean bored but I was practically hallucinating at that point from exhaustion) young man sitting next to me. And then they started playing it on our TVs!  He watched the whole damn thing! One scene where women make out does not a movie make.   2.) Good Will Hunting. I saw this with my sister (thank god as she was the one doing all the entertaining, the movie sure wasn’t) and we spent the entire movie making up new, replacement titles. I think I won with “good lord, puking!” Affleck wrote this and let his bestest butt buddy Damon star in it. It’s a movie about math. Yay! Robin Williams is also in it but since he abandoned all hope of ever appearing in a movie that didn’t suck back in the early 90s, I don’t have any comments about his performance. No, wait, one thing. I think he had retarded facial hair.  1.) American Pie. I had a free pass for this dreck and I still felt like I paid too much. Yes, I know some of you would pay good money to see Alyson Hannigan eat paste or read the labels on cans of cat food. She was doing neither here. I will admit when she was on the screen my nausea disappeared but sadly that was not nearly enough. The following people were in this movie because (I must assume) they had massive gambling debts, freebasing addictions and/or student loans they needed to pay off/for: Eugene Levy, Natasha Lyonne, Jennifer Coolidge, Molly Cheek, and Eden Riegel. The following people from this movie will be appearing in the surreal life in about 10 minutes: Chris Klein, Tara Reid, Jason Biggs, Mena Suvari, and Seann William Scott.  Especially  Seann William Scott.
