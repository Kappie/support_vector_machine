But the question remains, was it about greed, Martha? Or should you have really gotten some better financial advisers, and/or lawyers. Maybe we'll never know.  All I do know, is that I have to make some cupcakes in commiseration.  Maybe I could put some tiny files in them.  The Oscars went by in a bit of a blur this year, it seemed that I preferred to go and do a step class at the gym than watch them. What was that all about?  I think it's about the blandness that has beset Hollywood.  It was all there, the bland and the beautiful.  Bland movies, bland movie stars, bland awards.  When one single movie completely blitzes the whole show, you know that the, how ever many, members of the 'Academy' were possibly so bored out of their minds with this year's selection of films on offer  (or completely hyped up on the free coke), that they probably scanned the list of films and just went 'Yeah, Lord of the Rings, the kids loved it' - tick.   urlLink Despondent   has been my word of the week, really.  It's been mainly free-floating despondency, however, I was cheered this week while watching a very interesting documentary about happiness, and informed that basically, humans are predisposed to being happy due to the limbic system and the frontal lobes.   The best thing though, is that you can train yourself to be happy whenever you want!  Although the catch seemed to be that you had to be a Buddhist monk and dedicate six hours a day to meditation, or something along those lines.  But it's good to know that you can do it, if you had the time.  I bet Martha's feeling slightly more despondent now, though.  She'll probably have quite a bit of time to meditate once she's in jail.  See? Every cloud has a silver lining.
