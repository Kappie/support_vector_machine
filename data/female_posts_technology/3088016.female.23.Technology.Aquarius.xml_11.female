In order to celebrate a friend's graduation from Mortuary school, she is throwing a "combination Mortuary School Graduation and [Adult] Toy Party."  I just got the  urlLink Evite  for it earlier today.    There are several things that amuse me about this.  First of all, it's open to everyone, so there are actually a lot of guys going.  One response, by a guy who I won't name, says asks if he can bring his other two guy friends.  Hmmm...   Another is the response by the graduate's mom.  She will unfortunately not be able to make it into town for the party.  I can safely say that if a party of this type were ever thrown in my honor and my mom *was* able to attend, I would be the first mortuary customer.    Unfortunately, I probably can't attend.  In addition to my surgery about 48 hours before the event, I am also invited to a longtime friend's birthday party and a going-away party for another.  Kelly, I'm counting on you to exercise that famous picture-documentation ability as much as they will allow you.
