BIG mistake. I think i hear em havin sex. i didn't really feel like washing but now i have to wash the sheets and stuff. they're weirdos so i'm sure they're not jut having "normal" sex. maybe i should sleep in the living room or somewhere where i can't hear em. my roomis too close to the guest. anway, i guess i better go to sleep. i don't have to be at work til noon but i gotta go to my mom's to pick up my mail. ok yeah so i'ma sleep in the living room. this is retarded.
