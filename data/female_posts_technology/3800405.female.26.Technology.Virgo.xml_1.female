I submitted my list of things I wanted taken care of before closing, including bringing in an exterminator.   Boy, did she bring in an exterminator! She apparently spent $4000 on an exterminator. They told her they'd need 8 hours with no one in the house, which they used, and they were back the next day to finish the job. They replacedall of the insulation from the attic because it was infested, with rats. EEW! She even went so far as signing up for 6 months of monthly checkups by the exterminators to be sure they don't come back, and she won't even be living there in 2 months!   After finishing that and bringing in a roofer to inspect the roof and tell me she pressure washed it and that's why it looks unusually worn in a few spots, we've agreed on a set of things she'll take care of or give me a credit off the purchase price for.   I've got my insurance taken care of, so all that's left is to finish the loan process. It's a month minus a day from when I'll take possession, can't wait!
