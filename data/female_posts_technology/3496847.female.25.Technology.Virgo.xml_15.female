I unplug the modem, wait and reboot like the support guy suggested, but it doesn't always work.  I called my dad to see if he could help - he thinks that maybe something has come loose inside the tower. He thinks that when I moved to my new apartment it may have shaken something loose. I didn't tell him that I've moved the comp around in the apartment a few times as well. I'll call him later this week and have him walk me through doing it.  I was going to do it tonight, but there was a chance of a severe thunderstorm and it was pretty muggy. I will do it this week - I don't want to go another weekend without Internet if I don't have to.    Until I'm fully connected, blog entries will be sparse and the formatting issues will have to wait. And there isn't time to think up cute entry titles. I know the current font is big and ugly, but live with it. I also need to learn more HTML so I can spruce up the layout. So please, don't judge me (the blog) by my looks.
