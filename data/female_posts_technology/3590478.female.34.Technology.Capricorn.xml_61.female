So, here’s some tips. There’s 3 of you and 1 of me. Let me play through. It even says that on the back of the scorecard. What, I’m invisible because I don’t have a penis?  Clearly.  If you’re almost hit by a pretty pink ball 10 minutes after you’ve teed off, you suck. I suck and I almost hit you. I wonder if a ball from an invisible golfer would hurt if it hit you? Nine practice swings for every ball you hit is not making you better. It does get you called ass wipe at top volume by the player behind you though. But I guess that if you can’t see me you can’t hear me either. Hey, biggest tard of the lot, you’ve hunted forever for every single ball you’ve hit. You suck the best! Start dropping balls. And the ones you “lost” back into my fairways? You’ll never find those in my invisible golf bag. If you’re actually loosing balls backwards I think you should just go sit in the car and fiddle with the radio for the next three hours while your peni superior team mates play the remaining four holes. A note to the hawk on the seventh hole: Yeah it was funny a while back when you were trying to steal Heathers’ ball. But I don’t have time for your predator shenanigans today as I’m busy with the trio of losers. This one woods got a hell of a reach and your head is considerably bigger than that ball. You can’t keep it if you can’t pick it up and fly away with it. Move on.     Oh, now the twosome behind me can’t see me either? Can they see the dope show going on ahead of me? Your penis power is truly awesome. I wonder how your balls kept disappearing or ending up in the creek? Could it be that the woman you’re firing the balls like bullets at in front of you doesn’t like it? Nah, women on golf courses are invisible.  Hey homeless guy trying to sell me a huge bag of golf balls: Oh  you  can see me, great. I’ll bet it’s because I’m alone. No, I don’t want to buy those balls. Number 1, I’m poor and this $7 golf game was worked into the budget and number 2, I’m picking up free balls left and right from the bleeding, wanking, tossers ahead of and behind me. Was it a full moon yesterday or what?
