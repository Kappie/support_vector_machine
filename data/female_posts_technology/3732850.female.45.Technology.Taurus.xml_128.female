I don't see why women should not be allowed to do this because like the author states they could get hurt in any other job that they do. One point in this story that puzzles me is the question Can a nurturer also be a destroyer? But when you look at the issue women have been involved in the war forces for many years. Yes as many different parts and yes never as combat flyers. But we have still played an active role in the one thing that keeps are country safe and I think that is very important.
