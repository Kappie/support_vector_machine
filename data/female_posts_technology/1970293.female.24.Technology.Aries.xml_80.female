"And why are we going there today if I may ask since I am the pawn who is taking you there?" Trellian lowered his head and looked right into Bardric's face.  "Last night you said a wizard knocked down the magical barrier. I thought that today we would go find that wizard and make him put the barrier back. Satisfied or do I have to explain more?" The wizard placed his left hand on his waist while his right hand pointed his staff at the dragon.  "Oh, fine. Let's go since you are the only one with a plan at this moment." The dragon turned and lowered his body close to the ground to allow the wizard to hop on.  "Up, up and away." Bardric shouted brandishing his staff.  "Might I ask what all that was about?" Trellian turned his head and just looked at the wizard. He didn't move a muscle while he waited for an answer.  "I always wanted to do that. I can't help myself. I am much younger than you. Almost considered a child compared to your age." The wizard said blandly without cracking a smile.   "Now we get to hear about the age jokes. My day is so complete at this point that I feel I must take a nap." The dragon said dryly still staring at the wizard.  "Oh no. No nap today. Time to fly." The wizard smiled as the dragon turned around.  With a hop off the cliff, the dragon spread his wings, caught an updraft, and soared up into the sky. The wizard clung to the few handholds he found on the dragon's back. Probably a good thing that the mountain isn't that far off. It was a beautiful day with a blue sky and white puffy clouds. The wizard glanced at the ground marveling how tiny everything seemed from his perch.   "Are you sure you will find answers there?" Trellian asked as he turned north toward a ridge of mountains.  "If there are any answers in this world that is the place to find them. Plus all the wizards tend to stop in from time to time looking for answers so I just need to snoop around and ask questions. I should find a lead there." Bardric yelled almost choking on the sudden gust of wind as the dragon swooped down thirty feet before climbing back.  "I hope so." The dragon swooped again to gain more altitude before entering the mountain range.
