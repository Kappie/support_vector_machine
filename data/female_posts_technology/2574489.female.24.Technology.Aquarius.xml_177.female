With our regular account (which is about $23/month), we average about 3 DVDs a week.  We used to rent our videos from Blockbuster.  That's $4.82 a video x 3(DVDs) x 4(WEEKS)=$57.84=BIG SAVINGS. I urge you all to get a membership if its available in your are. Of course,  others are getting these DVDs and then burning them, but I would NEVER do that, would I? Ahem.  For those who needs some suggestions on what to watch, here is the list from my netflix queue (24 movies in all so far). I would also love some suggestions of what to add, especially for really good foreign films.   Secret Window Cold Mountain Mystic River The Cooler Girl with a Pearl Earring In America Moulin Rouge Secretary The Triplets of Belleville Devdas Fawlty Towers: The Complete Set: Vol. 1 Fawlty Towers: The Complete Set: Vol. 2 Monty Python and the Holy Grail   Fawlty Towers: The Complete Set: Vol. 3 The Man in the Moon The Importance of Being Earnest Legally Blonde 2: Red, White  Blonde The Cider House Rules Sex and the City: Season 4: Disc 1   Sex and the City: Season 4: Disc 2   Sex and the City: Season 4: Disc 3
