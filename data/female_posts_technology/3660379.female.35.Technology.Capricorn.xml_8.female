However, to recognize each of them for all their hard work, I am providing you with this list of some of my favorite foods often prepared by family and friends.       Mom (Sandy)  - The Next Best Thing to Robert Redford, Potato Salad, and Lasagna   Sister (Debbie) - Enchiladas and Sweedish Meatballs   Grandma Opal - Baked Spaghetti (with Bacon) and Ham & Beans with Cornbread    Grandma Izzy - Homemade Noodles     Aunt Judi - Peanut Butter Fudge and Chocolate Covered Pretzles    Shelly (Cousin) - Italian Sausage Lasagna    Julie - Spinach Pizza (even the crust is homemade) and Chocolate Brownies    Monica - Couscous and Black Bean Roll-ups   Erin - Chicken Parmesan and Stuffed Mushrooms   Ex-boyfriends (to remain nameless) - Kugel and Pierogi's    If I neglected to include your speciality, let me know :-)  Also, if you feel like cooking me a meal.. let me know!   LOL
