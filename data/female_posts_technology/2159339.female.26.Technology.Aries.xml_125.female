You may be with him for another day or another decade, but there are a zillion other better-constructed and lower-maintenance doods out there. In my humble opinion, the beauty of men is their simplicity, loyalty, dependability, and supportiveness. They're not supposed to be whiny pouty bitches! At least, not in public. Don't tell M, but his occasional bouts of poutiness make him a big fat GIRL. How's he supposed to care for you when he's busy whimpering about his wounds?  Unrelated, I read today that Star Jones has 500 pairs of shoes. She had a special closet built into her apartment to house and display her shoes, like art, she said. That is not insane. To me, that is perfectly rational and a mark of absolute lucidity. I'm set on expanding my own collection by three pairs.  I've rid myself of 2 pairs, so I deserve a reward. Rewards in the form of red wedges, gold flower sandals, and scalloped black pumps. Who needs men, really, when there are so many wonderful shoes in the world?
