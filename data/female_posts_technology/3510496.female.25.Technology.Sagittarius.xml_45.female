Anyway, last night, decided to pay a visit to parents' place, to see how mama's doing. She's much better, but this time round, her left knee giving her away. Papa, and sister, who were OFF from work and school, respectively yesterday, nicely gestured mama out, to take some fresh air out there. I think that should be encourage in her. She can't forever coup herself in the house. It's unhealthy. We don't encourage her to do marketing, hanging out laundry   or other heavy chores by herself, all for the name and benefit for her to recuperate. So, we thought a slow walk would do her no harm.  But when I saw her, she was all complaint of her knee from the earlier walk. Still nice-nice daughter offered to massage it gently with some ointment. I could see that she's having difficulty to move and walk, alright. Papa was telling us, that he intends to invest on a walking aid and threadmill   for mama. We think that's a very good idea. So, next shopping trip, hubby and I will be scouting for these 2 items.
