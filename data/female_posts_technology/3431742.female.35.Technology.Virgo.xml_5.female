Did a song or two from them.  Also did a Damn Yankees tone as well.  Pretty cool in my view. Rufus was awesome per usual.  Jen, Brenda, and I got guess passes so we did get to met him after the show.  Real sweetheart of a dude.  He is willing to play at Pridefest next year.  Now I just have to get my friend Todd to get him at the Gig. Tonight is Joan Jett.  See ya down there if you are there.  I was reading both the Fiji books that I have and trying to determine if the Island I select was the one I would really want to be on for the monies I have.  It's come down to a point where I'm thinkin Fiji is just not for a Single Chicka traveler.  Maybe  urlLink Palm Island  is the best spot for me or  urlLink Sanibel Island  is better.   I know there are several thousand islands out there but I'm not a money bags kinda girl.  Thoughts?
