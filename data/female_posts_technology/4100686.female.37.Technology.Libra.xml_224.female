As if by some queer diffusion of thought  urlLink Rusty Shackleford  is guest posting for  urlLink The Commissar.  He has posted a special collectors edition, can you guess  urlLink which blog stamp  is for this site?  I'm not really sure what  urlLink Rusty  is  urlLink saying.  Whatever it is Rusty, is this where i sing now?  *sings...*  Baby just  urlLink let me be...  Don' wanna be a   urlLink tiger  'Cause tigers play too rough Don' wanna be a   urlLink lion  Cause lions ain't the kind You'll love enough 'Just wanna be your  urlLink teddybear...   Yeah, you're right. I should stick to shaking hands.
