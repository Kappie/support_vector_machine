Well, yesterday, let me see if I can remember what I ate...no breakfast, but I was REALLY hungry so I had a plum and an apple around 10:30, lunch was shake and veggies and a COFFEE. I know, I know, but I was sooo tired. I also had a whole wheat bagel with nothing on it around 4 because for some reason I was super hungry yesterday, and I knew if I went to the gym without eating I would probably pass out. For dinner I had tuna, cottage cheese and raw veggies, then later on I had a bit of sorbet and a fruit to go.      I did get to the gym, and managed to do 30 minutes on the recumbant bike and 30 minutes on the eliptical trainer. I didn't do any weights because I am still a little intimidated by the weight room. (I don't know what the hell I'm doing; the machines have no instructions on them.) Someday soon I'll go workout with Ryan and he can show me what they are all for.   Today I might go to the gym between work and baseball, I haven't decided yet. It is a double header though, so I won't have much time to eat if I do that. Ah well, I might just do it anyway.       Harshala, I feel your pain about the bathing suit, but I find if I go swimming with a swim cap and goggles on, 1) I feel like I'm in a disguise and no one will recognize me anyway, 2) I look so stupid from the neck up that no one is looking at my body!       Also, I retract my statment about the inches lost. I measured again yesterday and it was back up to the old number, lol. I must have been sucking in. Still, I am now able to get into the shorts that were WAY too tight a few weeks ago. With room to spare! Hurray!
