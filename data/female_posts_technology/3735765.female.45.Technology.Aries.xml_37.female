I still don’t know; therefore, this project is difficult to do.  I am studying Criminal Justice because it is fitting with my background of a paralegal (a field of which I have worked throughout the past 15 years).  I don’t necessarily want to be working in the police department (the first career people think is your goal when you mention you are studying criminal justice), but I do want to be employed in a position that requires best utilization of my investigative and deductive reasoning skills.     These skills were used to a degree with my role as a paralegal; however, I am looking for something a little more rewarding – for example, I have volunteered as an advocate in the CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocate) Program; Child Advocates; and GAL (Guardian ad Litem).  All of these experiences were definitely rewarding in working with the children involved in the Courts as a result of abuse, neglect or abandonment; the problem is that working as a volunteer doesn’t pay the bills.   As a result, I have considered the options of being a director of one of these programs, or a similar program, in the future; however, it is somewhat a competitive market to be in because these programs aren’t just a dime a dozen, especially those that pay an income that one can live off of.      Alternatively, I am looking into owning a security business with a friend of mine that has more than 25 years of actual security experience in this area.  The idea is that the combination of his experience and my background as a paralegal and office management would be a combination that would give us an edge on most of the security companies in the area.  Learning the management of a security office would be new to me in that it would be in the security industry; however, I am not new to managing offices and/or various projects.  I am well skilled in those areas.  Management of a security office requires a license in this State though, therefore, my title would be that of a receptionist.   Although the title of receptionist would seem minimal and not worthy of my level of skills and abilities, it is going to provide a great jumping board to learning the field, obtaining a split of commissions for contracts that I would help to bring on board to build and sustain the company, learning the rules and regulations of the Private Security Commission, etc.  These roles would enable me to see the whole picture being developed.   In the future, my friend and I hope to be able to set up our own security business.  We have already talked with members of the Board and they are keeping an eye on us because of what we can both bring to the security industry when we do begin our own company.  The would be the ultimate goal for us to accomplish so that we can eventually work not as hard as the worker bees and be able to enjoy life a little bit more; however, that probably won’t be seen for another 20-30 years at least.   Other avenues that bring interest to me include being able to persue studying how to capture identity thieves and other computer related issues.   There is another whole avenue waiting to be explored and accomplished.  I would love to be on a team exploring those capturing options as I already thoroughly enjoy all sorts of computer aided research and writing, web developments (see http://Bluebonnetfields.blogspot.com and other links stemming off of that one), and so much more.  Between all my diverse skills and abilities, I am certain that someday I will figure out “what I want to be when I grow up”!!
