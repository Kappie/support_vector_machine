Plus the heat and humidity here are too much for me, and I need cooler clothing. I bought a dress, some capris, a few shirts and a new cardigan. I love a good cardigan, they're versatile, but a good one is hard to find. I'm not a big clothes horse, so black or navy blue is the way to go. Coloured cardigans don't match everything - I like a good mix-and-match wardrobe. I hate picking out what to wear in the morning, and for a girly, I'm not that fond of shopping for clothes.  My best friend and I went shopping on our lunch break yesterday. She just works down the street from me - close to the mall, so we met up. She needed a strapless bra for a cute outfit she bought to wear to a wedding today and I was looking for new sandals. She got a good bra, but it was in the "plus" section. She's a 38C. How is that a plus size? She's a size 10 in clothes - thin but not grossly skinny (i.e. Lara Flynn Boyle and Paris Hilton.) I can't believe what passes for sizing in clothes these days. I'm built about the same as her, but shorter - she's 5'9", I'm 5'6". We are not overweight.  Here is a break-down of the clothes I bought:  @ Reitman's Black  white capris - size 11 Gold Capris - size 10 (petite) Cute dress - size 9 2 t-shirts - size XL  @ RW (a subsidiary of Reitman's) Purple striped sleeveless top - size L  @ Jacob Black cardigan - size XL  @ The Running Room Dri-fit tank - size M  I can't just pick something up and hope it fits - there is no consistency. There should be a standard size chart for clothes sold in Canada. It could be North America; I don't really care. Just a standard of some kind. I don't care how the label it. There could be a scale for petite people (under 5'4" - that's right Ma, I'm not petite), hourglass figures, straight-shapes (no waist or hips - like me)....  I know there are too many different types of people for this to work, but I like to dream.
