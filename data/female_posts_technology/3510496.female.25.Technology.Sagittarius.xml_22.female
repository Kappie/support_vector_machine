It's been one week, hubby puts me on a 'torture' with it ever since I constantly fell asleep halfway in-front of the TV. Since it's a 'rare' condition of me like that, Dr Hubby 'diagnoses' I could be suffering from 'chronic fatigue'. Sheeez, its sounds so serious like I am suffering from chronic bronchitis. Analysing further causes, it could be due to my workstress, perpetual weight-gaining, bad diet, lack of vitamins.....    So, Dr Hubby's remedy recommendation is the *yuckies*  urlLink Apple Cider Vinegar    . Every night after dinner, now, Dr Hubby ritually, mix a tbsp of the vinegar and a tbsp of  honey    into one mug of warm water. It takes me almost 1/2 hour to sip to the concentrated liquid down my throat.    So we shall see the results of the consumption in the coming future.    Ohhh NO! Here comes Dr Hubby with a mug of 'it'. Help, help!
