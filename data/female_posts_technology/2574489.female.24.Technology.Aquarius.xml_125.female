Right now, as I am typing this, he is watching his Qi-Jong (pronounced Chee-cong) DVD, and following the slow, calculated movements of the old guy on it, all to the sound of Chinese instrumental music.    Have you ever heard of a Muslim/Arab who does tai-chi and qi-jong?  Who has a black belt in wushu, who can speak five languages, who refers to his take-to-work lunch as ' baon ' * , who can do flips in the air, who wakes you up in the in morning to say good-bye and whisper to you that there's eggs and bacon waiting for you on the kitchen table?  I have, and he's looking pretty Asian to me.  ***  On another note entirely, my allergies are acting up again.  The warming weather seems to be triggering it.  And, just like what I wrote in my  urlLink 100 Things , I sneeze loud.  I sneeze so loud at work that people on the other side of our floor can hear and will Instant Message me a 'bless you'!    *Tagalog word for packed lunch
