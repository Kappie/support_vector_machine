I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic .  Oh, Britney, how correct you are. You are a bit of a cultural toxin.  I think it's the bit with the strings in that song that mainly is sticking in my brain, they're so, I don't know, wrong.   Oh, what am I saying, everything about Britney is wrong. Just wrong.  I've been watching quite a bit of the music videos lately, and golly, it's all a little bit eye opening.  There's an enormous amount of flesh on show at every opportunity, which is perfectly fine, but where does it all come from? Is there some amazing machine creating incredible-looking black girls with double-jointed pelvis' in some Hollywood backlot?  There must be, like, a gazillion of them hanging around waiting to be cast in the next Usher video.  The weird thing is there's never any two alike.  It's kind of scary.  It's like there's a whole race of uber-video girls roaming the planet in tiny outfits ready to take over the world.   Which I guess for the heterosexual male population of the world, I'm sure would be perfectly okay. But I feel a bit frightened that they'd force the rest of us to go to the gym every day and only eat protein.    Okay, so I'm knitting again.  Which is totally cool, however, the enormous amount of yarn (I used to call it 'wool' but apparently that's old school, baby) I have is testament to the ridiculous-ness of my obsession with the whole knitting extravaganza.  I've acquired so much of the stuff, that it's taking over a whole room in the house.  I know this, because while clearing off the stash of yarn from the spare bed to make room for my niece, the pile was so high, at one point,  I couldn't see her standing behind it.    But joy of joys, next weekend is the Sewing, Stitching and Handcrafts Show at the  urlLink Adelaide Showgrounds . I am SO there.  It's gonna ROCK! It'll be the Big Day Out of craft, I can just feel it in my waters.
