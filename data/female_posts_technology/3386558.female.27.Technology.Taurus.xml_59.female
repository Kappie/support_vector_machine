we actually became better friends after the fact. we decided not to tell anyone about it at the time. it was just between the two of us (well, we told a few outside friends just because we had to tell somebody). it's been years since it happened and i figured there's no harm in talking about it now. i told my husband about it when we first started dating because we had told each other that if we ran into anyone we had slept with, we would let the other know.  so the group eventually broke up. two of us are now married, two are living with girlfriends, and mike is still a player. kev, chris, and tom all moved to north haven, and they get together every so often. i started hanging around with kim, and she introduced me to harry. i still feel to blame for all of us not hanging out anymore, but like harry said in "when harry met sally"..."a man and a woman cannot be friends because the sex thing gets in the way" (or something like that - i suck at quotes). when i first saw that movie, i didn't believe that statement. i thought it was a very male chauvanistic thing to say. i was young and naive (evian spelled backwards - it's the only way i can remember how to spell it).   so that's my story...  it doesn't upset me so much anymore. i have moved on and so have they. occasionally they pop into my head, so i think about them for a bit. then i put them away until next time. it's like looking at old pictures. you can't throw them out. they are a part of you.
