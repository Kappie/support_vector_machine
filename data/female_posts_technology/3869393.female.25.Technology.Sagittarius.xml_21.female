For men, if they say they want space, it usually means, I think I am getting bored, and need to check out some other women before I decide you are the one...this is a 90% probability situation, while for the other 10% , space simply means, you're nagging me just too much, I dont know if I can out with this for too long, so give me a break, let me return to sanity, and then come back to you!  For women, on the other hand means, let me think whats going wrong in our relationship and see if it can be fixed at all, this is 95% of the cases, and yes, theres' that 5% who use this cliche excuse to check out other men!  Why this difference in the meaning? Simply from the inherant nature of men and women...women tend to take more responsibility for the direction of the relationship, which is why, in most cases when a breakup happens, women tend to go thro' much more pain and misery than a man. It's kindof a situation like there's this part of them which is been removed from their system, something which they have nurtured and cared for.   So now, this brings us to the quesiton, why is the space so important in a relationship?   I would say withsome level of affirmity, that without this space between a man and a woman in a relationship, things will simply get too hot to handle and instead of colourful sparks flying around, it becomes colourful remarks! Relationships are something like sugar, heat it in a spoon, first it liquifies, then it starts to bubble with energy, then it gradually changes colours, yellow..to light brown..to dark brown, then it gradually changes it consistency, and starts to come out like pines and needles. At this point, if removed you get to make the best of the bases for ice cream servings, but if you dont and continue to heat the spoon of sugar, the sugar turns black, it gets smoky and then turns into tar!   Just like sugar, when one gives the relationship, enough space and time to grow it becomes a beautiful base or even the basis for making the best of pralines, but if not given the right space and time, it turns into a bed of tar!  Space helps people realise the true value of their relationship. Its' not a case of simply taking a break and thinking, oh my I have taken a break, is the guy/ girl checking out other ppl, but instead thinking, right, where is my relationship now, is it heading anywhere, where are the areas of concerns, can it be fixed, if it cant be fixed, how to work around it, etc. If one is able to take a third person perspective of the relationship during this break time, its' the best antidote which can be provided to a shaky or volatile relationship.  Give your partner that space, understand what is the meaning of your relationship, then you will have it in you to understand the true magic of the relationship!
