I grabbed some low fat coffee mocha chip ice cream and bought the book dimpsey recommended “holy cow” by sarah macdonald..and hit the park… I sat in my car with the windows wide open… and just read… it was a great feeling there was no one to bother me or scream my name as if I had just ran over a dog… no mom judging my every move ..and dad was not in sight… it was a great feeling for 2 hours I actually thought I was special ..and didn’t have a care in the world … it’s been a very long time since I felt this way..my life is so inter-twined with my parents’ and siblings’ that I’ve truly lost myself.. I had forgotten what really makes me happy…a book and an ice cream cone… I told ya all I’m not high-maintenance …   Question of the Day:  Why is it that I have no problem watching 2 guys make out but get a bit freaked when 2 girls go full throttle?
