Although I was completely sure I was over Derreck...why did I remember a convo where Lynn asked me if he asked me to marry him that day would I say yes? The answer was yes then...and I think it's still yes. WTF????? I need some new wang to totally and completely free my ass from that man. Free my ass...and my mind will follow!  Al called me last night. WTF???? Why don't I want to call him back? I have no desire to. I have been silently praying for male companionship. Placing ads on Cragislist (to no avail) and I'm not following up! WTF???  You know, living alone and spending loads of time alone like I do makes you really realize some shit about yourself. I am a really trife mofo. I am really trife and lazy about a LOT of things....housecleaning being a main thing. And I tried to buy a house. WTF???  I'm also still disturbed by the whole patio incident. Didn't write about that one. But long story short, I locked myself out on the patio and although people passed by, I didn't say anything. I was too...embarrassed or something. So I stayed out there all night. Finally in the morning, I timidly said something to the man downstairs and was rescued. But I stayed out there ALL night rather than be rescued. What's with this passive/agressiveness? WTF???  My weight...my eating...out of control. Me and Shaq might be about neck and neck. But I ain't 7 feet tall. I know what it is. The lonleliness is palpable (quiote from Carrie on Sex and the City). I eat in order not to feel the lonlieness. I eat so I won't feel. It's my company as I watch television.  That doctor was right. I don't really have much interaction with people once I come home. My phone barely rings. I have been really treating myself badly. Eating pasta and icecream and a bunch of other shady shit.  I need to stop myself before I pass the point of no return. I am about 40% sure that I will have the surgery before I turn 30. That may be too late. I may be well over 400 lbs by then. I think that's the point of no return. Once you get there, there is no way you're taking that off on your own.  Well on a happier note, I am going to start writing again. I went to a book fair last weekend and met this 25 y/o stunner (of no consequence, but just thought I'd throw that in) that was on her 2nd self-published book. WTF am I doing with my life!!!! That should be me. Living that dream. That's my passion. So I am going to take some fiction writing courses in the Fall. I think my market might be young adult readers---like 15-18. I want to catch them before they are reading that gangsta street shit. I want to write my Lexie-like stories, but with some real world shit. Like yes, they are gonna be fucking and cussing because that's what girls that age do. But with a moral in there. Like The Right Mistakes. We'll see.  Well as I said, I think...or thought I was ready to start dating again. In actuality, I think I'm scared of men. Scared of talking to an interacting with them. I think it's largely because of the abuse from the babysitter's son and Darren. Someone that made me scared of men. Wow---I've had that breakthrough before, but have never written it down.  I think maybe I should talk to a psychologist like I planned before. I got some shit going on in my head that I need to clear up. I need to figure out why I'm so lazzzzy...why I procrastinate....why I have all this ambition but sometimes find it hard to manifest it. Is that just me? Can that be helped? Or is that just me? And those are the same qualities that Derreck possessed. So I guess it's true. You are who you attract...  I am loving this blogging thing. Being able to peek into other people's world...other people's drama...I love it!  I just ordered these 2 CUTE shirts--1 for the Prince concert--says "Purple Rain" and one with "1908 on it". I am going to be a bad ass bitch! I may be "morbidly obese" but I'm still a fly ass bitch now! Chicks en-vee a sista. I be ragging!  I have been doing some good reading this summer. I think I've read about 7 books since the summer began and am still pushing on through. I've got a whole lot more to keep me busy. I call it research :-)  Okay, a bitch is really acting like she doesn't have to work tomorrow. I'll holla sooner than later. I think I am going to commit to writing at least 3 times a week. I gotta get my writing in somehow.  Until next time...ta ta!
