If you don't know what I'm talking about, check out this website  urlLink Eye for a guy   I happened to watch the first 2 episodes and I must say it makes American reality shows look so much better. I've to admit I watch it out of curiosity. Curiosity to see how our very own reality show fair. Curiosity to check out our local FHM girl. Curiosity to see how thick skin the contestants can be.  So what's my verdict? The show is not really up to the mark and production seems cheap. In addition, it does seem a bit too contrived. So what's your opinion?
