Spent most of my time sleeping, or reading  Endymion  which is as captivating as the  Hyperion  books.  Well, I did spend Saturday night at the Cullman County E.R. with a skydiver who had a hard opening. No real damage; he's just a hurting puppy for now. I hate that part of my job.   I was  outed in the Damian Lewis mailing list I'm a member of; someone apparently did some web-surfing and found my site. A few disgruntled comments about my use of the term 'slamhound', but no real flame-fest. I hope it's understood that sometimes I use a snarky tone when talking about things. I blame all the time I've spent at  urlLink TWoP .   Jon and  I have been freed from the tryanny that is  Bell South . Hooray! We are cancelling our land line and getting rid of our DSL line. Cable modem and cell phones make them redundant. We have never been happy with their service, anyway.   Later on  when I get home tonight I'll have some more boring pictures to post; they are not of our cats.
