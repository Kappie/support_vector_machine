Well, I am not very sure how long would I be persisting this "ingenious" idea of mine to travel for free in the substitution of waiting for the bus to come in the hot bloody sun. However, for the time being, I can still say that I am quite comfortable with the routine. Adeline told me that I am cheapbo when I told her this. Hahah..but I don't care...at least I can save money *hmpf*  I dropped by Daiso in IMM after going to library. I had the intention to buy a dumb bell to build up muscles in my ever-skinny arms but I dropped the idea and bought myself blotters instead. Boy, this act of mine revealed how vain I am.... In fact, I decided not to buy the dumb bell because the quality of the dumb bell was not as good as what I had expected (but what can I expect huh...since it costed only 2 bucks). Therefore, I decided that I can save the money by  NOT  buying the dumb bell and I do push-ups at home!   Adeline asked me to accompany her to watch Spider-Man next Monday and I am wondering whether should I go. After watching Shrek2, I have decided it is cool to watch animated movies. I mean, why not since technology is so advanced these days that the characters look almost real... Yet, on the other hand, I am thinking of saving money. I had planned to buy thermal wears with Linda on Wednesday...and my bank a/c was depleting....  On the subject of money, I think I am a failure in savings. I don't understand how come for working about nearly 2 years, I don't really save a single cent. Okie...I did have some basic savings now but that constitutes to my travelling expenses to UK next year. After I come back from the one-month trip next year, I would be back to square one again...with almost zero amount to start with. Haizz...I better don't think too much and concentrate on the present.  Algorithmic theory proves to be much drier than I thought it would be. Or is it the teacher? Anyway, after taking part-time studying, I realized that I enjoy the studying process but at the same time, I felt stupid as I was slow to pick up...That sounded a bit of contradiction isn't it? Hmmm....maybe I am one that enjoys being lost?
