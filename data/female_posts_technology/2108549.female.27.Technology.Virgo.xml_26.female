There was a gallery we walked by with the most amazing picture of a field of sunflowers and by this time I was starting to really like what I was seeing and even understanding the faintest amount so I went in and found a painting I fell in love with.  I can now say I understand when people say "It spoke to me".   urlLink This painting  (Turning Point II by Robert Watson) might as well have been a book from everything I read into it.  There is the person standing there, they have done some growth in life, coming out of a darkness and into the life. They have done footwork by walking up the steps and they are now at a turning point.  They look tired, weary from their walk but they have to decide.  Do they keep going, tired as they are farther into the light?  Or do they keep walking on the plateau they have reached into an abyss of nothingness?  Or there is the decision to turn back and return to the darkness. There is the white flag of surrender they will reach if they keep walking. Yet they have already experienced that light by simply starting to walk up the stairs.  There are also 2 shadows that seem to be in a face off if they walk into the abyss.  Its so amazing.    I might never own the original but someday, I'm going to own a print. I couldn't stop thinking about it after we left the gallery and obviously can't stop thinking about it now.  I want to meet the artist, sit down with him and say "this is what I saw, what did you mean? And what does this signify? And why did you choose these colors? And and and" :)  I know my facial expressions always give me away.  Love, hate, sadness, hurt, etc have never been unreadable in my face through my eyes.  I can't conceal what I feel and I'm sure the excitement and comprehension yesterday was no different.
