I'm working with Houston Fit you can find them  urlLink here.    This seems to be a positive way to meet people.  I signed up this past weekend and they are taking registrations through next Saturday.   If nothing else, what a confidence builder.  At the end of this program I will be able to say that I can complete a marathon.  Cool!
