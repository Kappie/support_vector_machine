Ok, so I go ahead and delete my webpage and then try to republish it.  NOPE - nothing doing.  The Front Page Server Extensions on the Cox server are out of commission.  This rankles me - BIG TIME.  I get on the live tech support chat to ream "Paul" a new one - he tells me they have been down for 3 days and he's sorry as hell.  As fast as my little fingers can type I let "Paul" know just how sorry he and the freakin' Cox horse he rode in on are.  He then sheepishly gives me 3 days of credit for my high speed internet.  I tell him that is all fine and dandy but it doesn't solve my webpage issues.  I red-ass spanked the guy via the live chat - it was a moment.  He told me to use FTP and signed off like the weasel he is and leaves me STEAMING about the whole thing.  I know nothing of FTP which is why I am using the g-golly Front Page.  I am totally pissed off.  Cox are bastards - all of them.
