The tone that I am refering to is that of a very deep intensived process that his people go through with the white people. Chief Seattle uses many examples of this treatment through out his writing of this essay but the one example of this use of tone that sticks out to me in his writing is "The white man's God cannot love our people or He would protect them." To me this is his way of getting back at the white man for all that we have done to his people. To me it is not the current peoples fault of what are ansestor did or didn't do to the red man or in the case of Chief Seattle his people. It is not like he owns them. In that way he is telling them what to do instead of letting them make up there own oppions on the white man and how we treat them. The major techique that he uses through out this essay is the way that he words things so that when you read it the reader gets the sense that the blame is on the white people if he is of a different background and this inside of it's self can cause problems if you go back in to history. If the reader is of white hertige this essay can make them feel like everything that they have no control on is all there fault when in reality they may have nothing but their heritige to do with it.
