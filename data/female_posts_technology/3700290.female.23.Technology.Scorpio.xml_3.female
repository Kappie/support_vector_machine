Being a very conscientious, and I should say VERY conscientious person, I kept staring at my reflection in the glass panels of the MRT.   Why didn't I notice that my skirt is at least 2 inches above my kneecaps before I left the house? I look more like   going to school and joining the cheerleading team than going to work. Staring below the skirt, I began to think of the exercise regime that I should start so that I could add some meat to my scarecrow-like legs and arms.   On the other hand, albeit those little complaints here and there, I felt happy. It had been quite some time that I really wear a skirt to work...I mean, those real skirts and not casual denim skirts. Maybe I should top up my wardrobe with more office skirts when I have the financial means. It is good to have a change at times. Wearing skirts make me feel more lady-like and less workholic...hahah....skirts have a psychological effect on me.
