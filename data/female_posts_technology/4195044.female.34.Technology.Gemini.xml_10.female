No more checkbook balancing.... no more accidental paper trail... no more writing so-called money on paper. I am aversed to this kind of chore back in Manila. I am terrible with numbers and I must - if I must, use Excel to be able to add (and minus) things up. I wish I have a personal Accountant, har har har!!!  So, here's to Dutch ingenuity:  PIN  -  Pinnen  and  Online Banking  ( ChipKnip  too! but I never use this so we can forget about that hehe). Purchases are directly debited to your account. Even the sleaziest cafeteria in the dark alleys in Groningen up north has a Pin System. On the contrary, Credit Cards are not that popular - take note.  With Online Banking, you manage all your portfolio via the internet. It is very   SECURE  . Banks give you this " Identifer " code - a tiny calculator-like machine which is programmed to match a series of number codes together with your Pin. Brilliant really. These sober-looking Cloggies would probably give you their winning cheesy grin and say  Gaaf ! In reality, these Dutchies just want mundane things to be   SIMPLER ,  FAST ,  EFFICIENT ,  ORGANIZED   and   CHEAP  .  Nifty swifty, is how you can describe transacting all financial movements over the internet.  Muah!  Kusje  Dutch banks :-)
