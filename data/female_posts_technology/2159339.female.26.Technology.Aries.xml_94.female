And unfortunately, inflate words to stupendous meaning when I don't mean anything at all. After 3 sake martinis at Fly last night, I told XX he was "the handsomest man in the world." Now, in my stark Tuesday morning sobriety, I admit that this is not the case. I find him attractive, but he's definitely not the handsomest man in the world. He has a triple chin. Sometimes, on a bad day, the count rises to quadruple. Why did I lie? I think it was to get him in bed. Though I have fun with him and he's now one of my best friends, I really cannot see myself spending an eternity with him. I'll take it day by day, but I want more drama! I want to be swept off my feet! I want someone worldly and dashing and suave, and accepting of me for me instead of someone who constantly asks, "Why are you like that?" or "What are you doing?" or "Why are you doing that?"   I've told him that it irritates me that he's constantly questioning me, but he just shrugs. He's a little violent in his play too. He bought me a mini-drill and he turned it on and started coming at me with it, pretending to drill into me. WHAT THE FUCK! Other people may find this amusing, cute even, but not me. That is not funny to me. That is like "pretending" to shoot me with a loaded gun. That's how Jerry Garcia lost his finger, people! He was "pretending" to chop his finger off and he missed! I don't like play that could end in tragedy. I don't like play that could end in tears, blood, or a trip to the emergency room.  But, like all relationships, there's always redeeming qualities that outweigh the annoyances. He told me that he thought I was the prettiest girl in the room at the rockabilly show (even though I felt like a butch bulldyke) and he told me that I'm cuter than his ex. He was also drunk last night, so these statements probably were inflated. But that makes me think -- how can I truly communicate when I'm too inhibited in my sobriety to say heartfelt things, but when I'm drunk, I just pronounce meaningless words to lure him into my bed? Is there a happy medium?
