I was born, raised, and have never moved from my city. I've traveled rarely, and limitedly. When I found this site, I realized I had landed a winner.    urlLink FindYourSpot.com  really has a great method of helping people discover which places in the US might suit them, on a permanent basis. It's really simple to use. You 'Find Your Spot' by answering a series of questions about your likes / dislikes, needs / wants. It will also give you IMPORTANT information about average home prices, climate, crime rates, schools, and even recreation activities. What's really nice is that I bookmarked my quiz at the end, oh... about a year ago, and I just opened it up again to find all my quiz results still there. Quite nice.  As I said, amazing content, and VERY Useful. Here's the grade and the reasons why.   WEBSITE GRADE FOR:  urlLink http://www.findyourspot.com       A    =  USEFUL CONTENT (4cr)     B    =  APPEALING DESIGN (3cr)    (The main page is Nice and Simple looking. There are a few page breakovers, but nothing major.)     A    =  EASE OF NAVIGATION (3cr)    (Very easy to navigate. The Quiz goes area by area, with a good category breakdown. Simple to follow.)     C    =  VALID CODE SYNTAX (2cr)    (Upon running a validation check on the HTML behind this website,  urlLink View Validator  The lack of a doctype declaration is quite unacceptable. This needs to be fixed. I  suggest going to:  urlLink Importance of DocType  to learn more.)     D    =  DISABILITY AND BROWSER ACCESS (2cr)    (Upon running a validation check on the HTML behind this website,  urlLink View this Validator , it came up with some problems that should be fixed. There were 10 images on the main page lacking alt text, and 24 browser support conflicts.)     A    =  FINDABILITY (3cr)    (Excellent Job! There were no errors in the meta tags, and that leads to us being able to find the site easier through search engines.)     A    =  FRUSTRATION LEVEL (3cr)    (Excellent Job! There were no broken links. However, the website (total size including all images that must be loaded: 57.3k) was estimated to take approximately 15.9 seconds to load over a 28.8 kbps network connection. That's not bad, especially considering that using the squished version (white space removed) of the webpage that this validation site offers, would save 16.3% on load time.)   Total Possible Credits = 20 Total Possible GPA = 4.0 Total Quality Points Given = 67   Total Website GPA =  3.35 (B+)    ~Review conducted by  urlLink WebsiteStyle.com ~
