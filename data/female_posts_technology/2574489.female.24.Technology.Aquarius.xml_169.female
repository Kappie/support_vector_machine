Dizzy and a little bit nauseous, plenty disoriented so forgive me if this post has typos, grammar mistakes, etc.  This is what I love about America, you go for a doctor's visit and pay $15 (for now, next year it will probably be $25, and after that $35 and after that...never mind).  They see you for 5-10 mins. and then send you away with an appetite suppresant. Ha!  When the doctor said that one of the "drawbacks" of my medicine was that it would suppress my appetite, I could barely contain my glee.  ***  On to the next topic. The 2004 elections.   Maybe its because I'm not caught up in a burgeoning relationship and school anymore, or maybe because I've acquired a sense of civic duty now that I'm getting (aray!) older.  But this is the first presidential elections I'm really paying attention to.   I've been watching the Democratic Party Convention and I'm loving the speeches, the veiled and not-so-veiled insults hurled at the other party, and the cheesy analogies, and self-congratulations. There is not a bigger circus than politics I tell you. I'm awaiting the Republican Party Convention to have a more balanced view of party platforms, but I'm pretty much convinced that Bush is a buffoon and should be ousted from the presidential chair. We'll see though, I could still turn Republican. I'm one of the "swing voters" the Democratic party keeps mentioning. No, not a "swinger" voter, a swing voter, meaning I could still be persuaded either way.   Actually I guess I'm not, cause I can't vote. I'm a Canadian citizen and I'm proud of it eh!  I had a third topic but it deserves to be on a post of its own because it will be about my hubby, that wondeful man of mine.   All I'll say for now is... "how wonderful life is, now you're in the world..."  (Still thinking about Moulin Rouge).
