It was a pretty bad connection but at least we could hear her voice.  I found out that the cd mixes I sent her were more popular with her roommates than her.  Kind of funny.  I figured she'd be really into the Shake Ya Body mix with a great assortment of dance music.  She did like the Random Mix for Ger.  And I didn't realize there are people that don't like the Beatles.  Who'd have thought.  Yesterday, I read  The Five People You Meet in Heaven   by Mitch Albom.  I liked it a lot.  It gives a whole new perspective on what heaven might be like.  I never thought of it like that.  Albom is really creative and writes in a very engaging way.  A lot of the scenes were very colorful and resulted in these vivid mental pictures.  I'm officially a fan of this author.  I liked this book even better than  Tuesdays with Morrie .  Although that one was great too.  They both teach you some lessons.  Now I'm reading  Disgrace   by J.M. Coetze.  It's well-written and I'm enjoying it, but the main character is pretty despicable.  It bothers me when the person you're supposed to like is clearly a bad guy.  It's hard to read sometimes, but the writing is so wonderful that I can't stop.
