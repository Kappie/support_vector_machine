Django Reinhardt was some French dude who put together American jazz and gypsy music in the 1930s, which means the music sounds like jazz except it's coming from unexpected instruments.  The concert was performed by seven musicians who had studied in that style.  It was like nothing I've heard before.  Not that I make a habit of going to classical concerts or anything - if they're all this cool, maybe I'll do this more often. There was a  jazz violinist .  See, I never would have even put those words in a sentence together, but apparently there is  more than one  (the playbill says that this violinist, Roby Lakatos, is "one of Europe's major jazz violinists").   He just wailed on that violin, playing really fast and getting lots of range out of it. OK, that's not a very descriptive description, but I don't know the right words for what violins are supposed to sound like.  Anyway, at the end, after the violinist had finished this really long and complicated solo, the lead guitarist, Stochelo Rosenberg, took the violin from him and played a pretty good solo of his own.
