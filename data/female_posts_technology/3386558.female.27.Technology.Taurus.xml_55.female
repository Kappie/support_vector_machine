Lovecraft, which was very good. i got into his work while i was still in high school. before that, i read some sylvia plath ("johnny panic and the bible of dreams"). it was a collection of short stories, essays, and journal entries. good stuff. before that, a collection of shirley jackson's short stories, also excellent. and i also had the unfortunate displeasure of reading nick hornby's "how to be good". now i am a nick hornby fan. i like his work, his style, his stories. but this book blew the big one. i went on a huge rant about this book to jessica a few weeks ago. terrible book. i don't recommend it. do not read it. do not waste your money. yeah, that bad.  an author i would recommend is jane green. if you are into the bridget jones variety of reading, jane green is the way to go. her style is different from helen fieldings, but her stories are as wacky and original. i started with "bookends" which i absolutely adored. i've also read "jemima j", "mr. maybe","babyville", and "straight talking". all are excellent. she has a new one that just came out that i will have to pick up in the next month, as does helen fielding. melissa bank is also good, as is mary karr, anna maxted, megan mccafferty, and laurie halse anderson.   then there is, of course, virginia woolf (and i include "the hours" in that because "mrs. dalloway" was it's muse), aniis nin, henry miller, jack kerouac, john updike, sylvia plath and shirley jackson, as i already stated, sandra cisneros, and on and on and on.   then of course is more of my sci-fi/fantasy fixation. the harry potter series rocks. so does "the lord of the rings" and "the hobbit". peter straub is wonderful. madeleine l'engle, william shatner's star trek stuff (yes, i am a bit of a trekkie), and of course, stephen king. i also like some comic book stuff, mostly graphic novels. james o'barr's "the crow" kicks ass. i love "kingdom come", "the dark knight returns", "batman: year one", "death", and "the watchmen". i love the novels "kingdom come" and "the death and life of superman". am i beginning to bore you all? ok, i'll stop.
