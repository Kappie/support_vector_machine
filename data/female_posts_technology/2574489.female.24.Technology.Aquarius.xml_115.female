Of course not entirely happy, as some of my professional frustrations spill into it, and there are some things I want to change. But I am a generally happy person anyway. Here are some things I'm looking forward to, am grateful for, etc...just things in my life that make me happy:   Trip to San Diego! It's in 3 months. But it will hold me over till next year's trip to the Phils.  In San Diego, they have yummy Filipino treats galore...I'll get to taste the empanada I've been craving for!   The summer! I can't wait to buy my first new bikini in 5 years...yup, that's 5 years...i've been wearing the same things over and over...and can't wait to visit a water park to get a much needed tan   Trip to Vegas in November! My hubby is dragging his feet cause he doesn't want to spend the money, but I've been saving like crazy and I'm confident we can afford it.   My coach purse that hubby promised me...hahaha... mababaw  *    The fact that I've been able to regularly work out for 2 and 1/2 months.  There's been a slight improvement in the belly area, but the best improvement is with how I feel.   Almost ready to take my network+ test! Wish me luck.   This real estate deal that is coming together for me and my partner...even if it doesn't pan out, at least I did  something  to make goals a reality instead of giving lip service to it   My hubby of course! He's the best!   Japanse food....gosh, they're so yummy and have been enjoying eating them a lot lately.=)     *this is a Filipino word for shallow
