However, I got very restless and had to go do "things".  What sort of things?  Hmmm, go to Ikea and get a new computer desk, go to Sam's Club and get a crafting table and haul all this stuff home.  We also did the grocery shopping, laundry and took in a Nature Walk at the local atrium.  Today I just had to put together the new desk before 10:00am and then just tore up some cardboard sitting in the garage.  Geez, so much for relaxing.  I don't seem to get how to relax.  I did do Yoga this morning...does that count?    Anyway, I have many things at work that I'm wanting to get a jump on tomorrow morning.  I have these new servers just waiting for me to install them...it has all my Geekamones going.  I've been working towards getting my company to an Enterprise level of server architecture and it's hard to convince management to part with their money.  But I am one step closer with these new blade servers I had them get.  Now if they would only finish up the order so I can complete the Windows 2003 Active Directory upgrade.  I warned you that I was a geek.  ;-P  So, today is my mom's birthday and I lost her phone number.  She doesn't really seem to want to celebrate it so I just sent a card because that is what she said she wanted.  But right when I was going to look for the number, she called me.  Not about the Birthday mind you but about the diet both Renee and myself had been on.  We lost 35lbs a piece on the South Beach Diet.  I would recommend that diet because of the focused on low fat, heathly meats and veggies.  The low carb thing is rough on your ability to be regular, but it works on the weight loss.  So, we talked about that for a while.    The relationship between my Mother and myself goes like a Roller Coaster.  There are definitely ups and downs...and fast curves.  I don't believe that mom is very stable in the head but it took lots of therapy for me to realize how much I am like my mom.  I don't like that too much, but I'm working on it.  The latest thing was that I didn't talk to her for a year because she wanted me to go to a deprograming seminar for gays and Lesbians and telling me how Renee brings nothing to my life.  It took me a while to finally let it go and grow up a bit (master of understatement here...as you may or may not be able to tell).    That's about all today.  I'm finding that this is a nice venue for my thoughts and ramblings.  I use to be very faithful in writing in a journal, but I'm infront of a keyboard most the day and it is convenient to just logon and post something.  Maybe I'll get a reaction, maybe not.  Who really cares?  As long as I'm being true to me, that is all that matters.  Thanks for Reading...
