Beautifully written, well-paced (until near the end). I am very fascinated with Japanese culture and the lives of these socially condoned flirts and mistresses is even more so.  Alongside my enjoyment was dismay at the fact that these women were forced into the life they were living. That they were being treated as object, prizes to be won, with their virginities up for grabs in an auction as young as 15 years of age.  They were subjugated, and whatever rights they enjoyed was directly proportionate to how much money they earned, by entertaining constantly and by acquiring a  danna  or sugar-daddy.  The number of geishas has dwindled to almost extinction, but there are still some of them in circulation.   I wonder how it would be if the roles were reversed and we had men, trained from childhood on how to please women? Now that would be something.
