Ironically, I had a  purple  jeans, which I think it's the most 'oh-bit' garment I had in my wardrobe during my early teens. I remember ONLY wearing it a FEW times ONLY at night-outing to get it unnoticeable. Somehow I overcome my skepticism against this 'Barney' colour. You see, now  purple  simply doesn't come in boring  violets  or  grape -likes. There are tints of  lavender ,  lilac  which are ... errr ... simply purplish!   I wore  purple   songket  during my  sanding . I splashed the whole of my dining/living/bedrooms with  lavender . And what else? I am hunting for  purple  pillows to 'throw' at my upcoming daybed.   MORE  PURRRRR-PEARRRRRLLL !!!!!       Anybody spot a Manolos?   But the one I am currently falling-in-love-and-dying-to-get is the one right at the bottom,  urlLink the jelly strappy sandal in lavender vinyl frosted .   Aiyoyo ... don't tell me I am going for another round of shoe-buying.
