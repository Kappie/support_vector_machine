The idea of a house isn't something that interests me, however, a condo sounds more my speed.  Luckily, my sister is a real estate broker, so I don't have to worry about that part of it.  However, it's making the decision of which condos to look at?    A couple friends own condos up on the North-side, and I've pretty much lived on the North-side since moving here after college.  But, there's the lure of Broadripple ( urlLink think Monon Trail ) and  urlLink Eagle Creek Park  area.  UGH!!  I just can't decide.
