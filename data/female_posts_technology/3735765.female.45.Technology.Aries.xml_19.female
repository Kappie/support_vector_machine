(NOTE TO SELF:  If at a point in time I am able to be on the giver to the pantry again, I am going to concentrate on healthier food options.  It is so welcomed when a case of bottled water and/or fresh veggies/fruits are available as alternatives to canned veggies and beans.  I think more considerations should be given to things to cook with as well -- oil, butter, milk, cheese, etc. to provide flavors to those that are food pantry recepients.)  If one is forced to buy inexpensive foods at the grocery stores, it is sad that most of the inexpensive items are the most caloric options.  Why is that????  In reading an article on the net today,  urlLink Snacking: Which foods are healthy, which are not -- 9 snacks that might surprise you , it was certainly an eye-opening viewpoint.  For example, I had always thought bagels were a good alternative; according to this article, it might not be the wisest choice.  Right now, I am hungry for some grapes -- anyone got any grapes to share????
