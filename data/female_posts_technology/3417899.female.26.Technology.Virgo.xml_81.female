       
      Driving back from a long weekend trip, A few hours on the road, several hours ahead.  The sun was beginning to set (or maybe it just seemed like it), my husband was dozing off on the seat next to mine, and I was (uncharacteristically) at the wheel.  Our ipod playing songs, shuffled from a playlist.   And then,    this song   comes on.  ימים של שקט (Days of tranquility)   I listen to the harmony playing, hear the steady breaths of my husband, and I am...soothed.  And I suddenly believe - they are coming. Days of tranquility.
