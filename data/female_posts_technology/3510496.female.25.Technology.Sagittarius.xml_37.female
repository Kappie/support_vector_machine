Out, damn those ...    Perspiration stains:  Mixing equal parts of ammonia with water, add a few tablespoons of liquid dish soap and soak the garment overnight. Then wash as usual. (Liza n.b. Ammonia? Chemistry class reloaded. I remembered it release some pungent gas we nicked as 'German Gas'.)   Collar stains:  As shampoo dissolves body oil, take a small paintbrush and brush on some on the collar before washing.   Grease stains:  Sprinkle talcum powder on it to absorb the fresh stains before putting your garments into the washing machine   Food stains:  Saliva can be applied to the stain believe it or not! The former contains enzymes that can break down protein-based food stains. (Liza n.b. I am thinking of collecting my saliva and bottled it up. Saliva for SALE, anybody?)   Wine/coffee stains:  Sprinkle moist salt to absorb the stain first. Then wash with detergent in cold water.   Blood stains:  Pour hydrogen peroxide over them before washing. (Liza n.b. More chemist stuffs, and where am I suppose to get that?)   Ink stains:  Alcohol makes the stains perform the disappearing act when you rub some on them before washing.   Liquid paper/permanent marker:  Dabble sunscreen over the stains and rub with papwer towel until the stains disappear.  ~~~  Are the smell of  mothballs   making you sick? To get around the problem, put those  slivers of leftover soap  to creative use. Place the soap bits in unsealed plastic bags and pack them up together with your clothes. Not only will the scent keep the bugs away, your clothes will also smell like fresh meadows. (Liza n.b. Trust me, this works. I've bug off those mothballs because hubby has kind of allergy to it.)  The laundry basket overflowing with soiled laundry can be a potential  stink  bomb. Sprinkle  baking soda  at the bottom of the basket to help absorb some of the embarrassing odours.  Saturate  cotton balls with your favorite perfume  and put them in corners and shelves of your wardrobe. How's that for wearing (literally) the fragrance that is distinctively you?  ~~~~~~~~~~  Talking about my  urlLink upgrade-update list , I will be observing point no 4 this coming weekend. I intend to whip up Swedish meatballs, recipe complimentary from  urlLink this . Simply an indulgence after learning that some of us going goo-goo-gaa-gaa hearing our non-Muslim acquaintances palating the famous 'balls' in Ikea.  And yes. I was just flipping M.Hood *2 issues ago*. Spot a photograph, with a familiar couple but unfamiliar baby. I remember now. A friend of hubby. Lovely.  ~~~~~~~~~~  What?!  urlLink Cybertarp  is unable to run free picture gallery anymore. So I signed up with  urlLink Photobucket , but I am having problems in getting to display my pics. Help! Help!
