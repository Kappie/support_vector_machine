I have ruined my chances with M2 and now that I'm deciding to end my psudo-something with M1, I'll be flying solo again. But that's just fine.   In other news, went for a six mile hike yesterday in Muir Woods with M1 and Genny and Alex and now my ass cheeks feel like ground chuck. It was worth it for the most incredible view I have ever seen and getting out of the city for a day.
