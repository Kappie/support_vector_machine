I am home alone today, which is about the worst place I could possibly be, because "alone" and I don't always get along.    I got the job with Force, which is good news, provided we don't all get laid off in three months when Solectron sells it. I start on the 15th. I gave notice last Tuesday afternoon.  By Wednesday morning, a flash flood had come and destroyed most of Adax.  Now some would say this is some kind of karma happening, some physicalization of a clean sweep, a washing away of pain and frustration, and, in the literary sense, I suppose it is.  But in the physical sense it is very different.  I only wanted to leave my company. I didn't want to see it destroyed. I didn't want to see my co-workers walking around in a daze as years of work floated in the lake. I didn't want to see it torn apart; I didn't even want to see the horrible crazy owner sitting, staring into space because two days after he buried his father in an Adax teeshirt, Adax was under a foot and a half of water. Nobody really wishes harm.  But see all those things I did. And it makes me sad.  I've been off of work since I made it out of the flood on Wednesday morning, spending money as though I had no budget, and tomorrow I'm supposed to go back to work. I can't imagine why. My furniture is not usable, my files are pulp. I'm not sure why I'm wanted there, except maybe to remind me of the karma.  But surely there can be no karma in my estranged friendship with Thomas. I do not believe I did anything that would actually make me deserve the pain I'm in now, and I've been doing some serious self-examination here.  I've done nothing but provide that man friendship. I've done nothing to cause his fiancee harm, though the only reason I don't like her is because she rejected any possibility that I might be a friendly sort.  But here it is.  How does one ever know if a friendship is real?  At what point do they say, "Okay, this person isn't going to suddenly change personalities and decide I am no longer worth anything in their lives. This person isn't after anything, this person isn't lying to me, doesn't want to cheat me, and only wants to share my life as a friend"?  And then, after you've reached the point of acceptance, that they're not going to do any of those things, what happens when they do?  Thomas is there, and then he's not. And sometimes he's there and he's not at the same time.  Thomas is cold and can inspire great intimidation. Thomas is a warm, wonderful and loving man who earned a piece of my heart with his quiet dedication and daily e-mails.  Thomas opened up to me. Thomas damned me for knowing about him. Thomas won't answer my e-mails unless they're school related. Thomas invites me to coffee and encourages me to keep writing e-mails that aren't school related.  Thomas comes with me to see Mark's play and even comes to our party. Thomas pretends past conversations never took place, Thomas won't discuss the play.  Thomas has no time to get together, Thomas goes to political events twice a week. Thomas has time for a walk in the afternoon. Thomas forgets to tell me that he doesn't have to take a day off without pay every two weeks now.  Thomas is friendly and nice. Thomas is cold and heartless.  All at once, sometimes sequentially, and all of it new.  Thomas marked me down.   The e-mails that say how much I mean to him--are they null and void?  Why should I put up with this? Thomas asks me to be patient. I wonder what I am being patient for, exactly. But I can deny what was once my dear friend Thomas Loecherbach nothing.  Once you've determined that this person is a real friend who would never kill you slowly with little tiny stabs, then bandage them, then stab you again, you start to love them. You find a safe place in them. And when the knife pokes start coming, you don't believe it's real. You don't believe it will last. You don't understand what happened. And you think if you can stick it out, if you can survive this, you'll have your friend back.  I wonder how long one should believe this?    My fingers so automatically type "Thomas" because they have every day for two years, that they like the familiarity of the sequence. I loved the familiarity of the friendship. And I want it back. Is this my karma for something else? Do I deserve this?
