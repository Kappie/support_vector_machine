Yet pride, ego and fear get in the way.  So many have ulterior motives, hidden agendas, unspoken feelings.  It becomes not worth it when the cost is considered.  Sometimes I want to disappear.  Not run away, simply disappear for awhile.  No commitments, no responsibilities, just nothingness.    Sometimes I cry at funny movies and laugh at sad ones.  So many scripts and books are written to elicit emotion, yet sometimes they are overdone and simply comical.  Sometimes I wonder if there is truly a way to rewrite the past. Not to change events or their outcomes but to change my perception.  To make it so that lessons were actually learned instead of having to be repeated.    Sometimes I long to be ugly.  While I am no show stopper, people tend to see me but not hear me.  How frustrating it is to know that intelligence has to be proven for someone to see past the outside.  Sometimes I drive fast just because I can.  Something akin to tempting fate.    Sometimes I smile when I only want to cry.  No one wants to be around someone who is always upset.  It pulls people down, its draining and overwhelming to be around all the time.  Sometimes I wish that everything I have done right I did wrong and everything I did wrong I did right.  Sort of a checks and balance system to see what side adds up more.  Sometimes I don't want to know me.  For what I see on he inside you could never fathom when looking from the outside.  Yet what you see on the outside I can never understand from looking within.  Sometimes I long to be ignorant.  To be happy with *less than* or under-achieving.  What I expect from myself, I would never dare to expect from others, yet the expectations rise daily.
