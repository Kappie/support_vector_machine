This wasn't a popular choice when I took a poll on a  urlLink previous post .  I chose it because it was the cheapest and my uncle and aunt and adorable cousins are there (see sidebar for pics of family in UK). It has a slightly higher exchange rate (which is abysmal on the dollar) than Paris as well.  I am happy on our choice!  And very excited. I can't seem to stop babbling, planning, daydreaming about our days in London, which won't happen until October, timed to let us save more money, and for more convenience and consideration for my job (which professes to need me during the busy rush of August and September).  We're staying at a not-too-shabby hotel, walking distance to the West End district and close to the British Museum.  Anybody have any tips to make this trip more fun, safe, efficient? I welcome it!  It's London, baby!
