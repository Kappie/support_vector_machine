First the bad stuff...my body ache is starting to climb on me again, and the idiotic stomach prob aint settling, so the medicines have to continue..boohoo...hate that stuff, coz its killing my appetite big time! Am just hoping that my body ache settles down so that my trip for the next three days doesnt get wrecked. Anyways, the popping the pills session will need to go on for a while...as much as I hate it!   Good stuff now....hmm, I found a guardian angel,who kindof gave me a solution to my php program, but then the software works on all systems, but mine...:(( Seriously depressing! Anyway, am hoping to somehow find a way to make this work. Kindof reminds me of the days I sat with him and slogged it out with this software trying to dig out a bug and make it work. Finally found out that it was one stupid marker which we had ticked by mistake. Hoping that this prob will get solved and will have the software working on my system soon, else I lose my bet...boohoo!  Today the first steps have been taken towards my team integration, and am hoping that this will make some sense in life and wont be yet another flop show. Because if its'a flop show, there is more to lose than gain in this!   Need to go and purchasea gift for my dad today, wondering what to get him. This time we will be visiting his ruling deity temple on his birthday, so am super happy over that. Am praying that this trip goes off well for everyone, coz it's a trip which will hopefully bring back the happiness to my entire family!
