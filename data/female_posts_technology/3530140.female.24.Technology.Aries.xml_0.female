My three week hiatus was not completely due to the lack of connection. I've been living my work. It owns me. This past week especially has been most tiresome. First, I must admit I'm not a morning person. Strange, I know. This means that work doesn't typically start at 8am for me. Add 30 minutes to that and you have programmer hours. Imagine my horror when we were ordered, not told, to be ten minutes early to our week long Java class that started at 8am. But luckily it was scheduled to end at 4. Was that why we were all still doing labs at 5:30 in the evening? My college years passed before my eyes. Suddenly I had a renewed craving for coffee and ramen noodles. That's nothing, you say? Why yes, I would have to agree except for the minor detail that normal work continued to happen outside the realm of college land. Therefore, even though I left at 5:30 in the evening, my work day didn't end until 10pm. Rinse and repeat. Friday had never looked so good and I'm glad I made it.  Before I crash and burn in my bed, I have to share a story. The trainer of this Java class was your typical computer nerd/freak. He was very knowledgeable in the topic of discussion, but delivery was dry and calculated. Through the week, we had gotten to know him pretty well and today, he felt most comfortable with us for on the way back from lunch he asked the driver to whip out some eminem. Shy, reserved computer freak teacher became a playa hatin' cracka. The situation peaked at the moment when he attempted to keep the beat by snapping his fingers. I'll never be able to listen to 'Cleanin Out My Closet'with a straight face again. Mr. Trainer IS the rap lovin' movie character from Office Space. A perfect way to end a Friday.  Fatigued, Pinkie
