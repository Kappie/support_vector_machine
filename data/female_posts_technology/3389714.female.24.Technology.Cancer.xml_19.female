I’m your typical ABCD that will never understand anything typical desi…I remember sitting in a 15 passenger van with various family members wearing sari’s and dothi’s … I was told we were going to visit my dad’s house in some remote village in Gujarat.. Mom told me dad had a great big farm with cows and buffalos .. I was soo excited…I thought it would be a bit like Little House on the Prairie … god damn was I wrong..in his little village the roads were not paved and there was cow droppings everywhere…and everyone spoke a different launague..mom said it was guju ..but it was a different dialect that we were used to… but she stated I could manage if I told family members to talk slowly…haha..PS: mom it didn’t work..that’s why I never spoke to anyone..they kept laughing at me…and calling me “Miss America”.  They all thought I was to “gori” for them…anyways..i didn’t care to speak to anyone…I had my Grandma and Grandpa..who understood English and I understood their Guju…so we got a cute little compromise going…well on my first day in dad’s village … I decided to sit outdoors most of the day..inside it was too hot … and outside there was a cool breeze.. it was odd in December the weather was decent in the mind 70’s and people were wearing blankets and sweaters ..like it was 40 degrees.. I guess they're not used to it…I used to sit on a little porch with my dada…and watch people work..I thought it was entertaining…the paan guy was always busy…making paan and mavo..and ever so often he’s spit out red crap on the dirt road..he was amazing..he was able to spit like 10 feet away.. I was totally dumbfounded ..he’d win any spitting contest here in the states…but my most amazing and vivid memory in dad’s village was the old lady who collected cow dung…she would walk around and collect all this crap and place it in a straw basket which she perfectly balanced on her head…she’d get mucho dinero if she worked for Ringling Brothers and Barnum Bailey Circus..i knew she had skills…but check this out ..guess what she did with the cow dung…she put water and straw on it and played with it ... like it was playdough…I could see the dung water slowly running down her arms and making small droplets near her elbow.  She’d wipe it off with her blue sari…and continue on kneading her pile of sh*t…like it was some sort of atta…but what I luved the most was that she’d take a piece and roll it into a ball then pat it out till it looked like a disk..afterwards she’d balance this 8 inch disk in her left palm and swing her hand over her head ..and with all her might fling the disk into a wall…in a few hours the whole wall would be covered with cow dung disks…and she’d clean up her mess and go into her concrete hut…the next day I saw the old women peeling off the disk from the wall and placed them carefully in a basket like there were mom’s special dinner china set only reserved for stuck up anti’s…before long the old women was off again to collect more cow dung..I was baffled ..this women must luv playing with cow sh*t…I wish I had some playdough for her…however if u toss playdough into a wall it won’t stick..maybe she was tryin out for the Olympics…she was pretty good..anyways .. I watched her do this for about 4 days then I got curious ..i mean hello … no one enjoys smelling like cow poo all day…I finally asked mom..and she told me they take the disk and burn it in a fire stove it tends to give off a great amount of energy and heat…because wood is hard to find where my dad lives the locals burn cow dung and straw in their stoves…well I was absolutely grossed out that I stopped eating anything that was made from the dung burning stoves and decided I’d live on prepackaged food that u didn’t have to warm up and fruits….but I still wonder about that old women..and her making cow dung patties…she must have really liked what she was doing…she always had a smile on her face and hummed sweet bajans while she worked under the hot sun…I wish her well…however I still refuse to eat roti off your stove…sorry…   Question of the Day:  Do you think it’s possible for someone to learn to love their spouse after they had an arranged marriage?  I do not think this is possible, I believe one should fall in luv…it don’t think it’s right to force oneself to love someone..one should not compromise to attain love…It should just happen naturally…
