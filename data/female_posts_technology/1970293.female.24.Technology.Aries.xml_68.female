Bardric looked around at the mountain peaks but could see no differences between them.  "How are we going to find this wizard?" Bardric yelled as he peered ahead.  "First we look for the highest peaks and then we check each one out. Sooner or later we should come upon the one we need." Trellian yelled back as he hovered for a second.  "Oh I am so glad I came with you. You make the best plans I have ever came to hear about." Bardric said in his most sarcastic voice.  "Do you have a better idea?"  "No I don't."  "Then we do it my way. That peak there looks higher than the rest." Trellian pointed with a claw before flying closer.  As they flew closer, Bardric could see something strange about the peak. It didn't seem to have the natural formation of a mountain peak at all.   "I believe we may have found it, Trellian. Fly in slowly and carefully." Bardric warned as he brought his staff to point at the peak like a knight's lance.
