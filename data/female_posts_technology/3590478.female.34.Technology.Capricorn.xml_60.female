So, as I was packing my Buffy lunchbox I took a set. Then I wandered off to put on my shoes and brush my hair. (HaHa! That’s a joke, I don’t have enough hair to brush and haven’t actually brushed it since I got it cut. I combed it once though so settle down.) I forgot I’d taken the first set and took a second set when I went back into the kitchen. During the morning meeting I was buzzing like Bevis hopped up on sugar.    I just found out about something called Brazilian steak. It’s a tender steak, not marinated or otherwise molested in any travestied way, rolled in chunky salt then grilled. Oh my god, my evil, carnivore, salt whore heart is stopping at the mere thought. Also, I drooled a little.  Z93 has changed their format. They used to be pretty good (and the radio station of the gods compared to 99X these days) except they played too much Led Zeppelin (yeah, yeah, is there even such a thing as too much Led Zeppelin-stop helping me stoner hippies). But now they are outstanding. In one 40 minute block I heard Elvis Costello, really, really old Elvis too, Icicle works, Tom Petty, Nirvana, Oasis and the Stray Cats.  They are still too excited about their format change so they spend 20 minutes telling us how great they are, don’t be afraid of the change etc. And I haven’t heard Mara either. After the commercial break of them flogging themselves with goodness, they played old Indigo girls. When I  switched back  to them they had moved on to Live. Ok, so lay off the “we are so great” plugs, the Indigo girls and Live and bring back Mara. Then we can continue with the cruising of the outstanding.  Remember that Episode of Buffy where Dracula shows up? It turns out the guy that played Dracula played Kendall’s husband on AMC when Sarah Michelle Gellar was playing Kendall. That would explain a lot about Erika, wouldn’t it? Her daughter is a vampire slayer and her son in law is a vampire. HaHa!  Todays’ fantasy marriage, Hollywood edition: Male-Giovanni Rebisi. (Giovanni was on my two dads where he sported an adolescent mullet. That show was bad because Paul Reiser was in it and it was stupid. That show was good because Greg Evigan and Giovanni were in it and it was stupid.)  Female-Andrea Parker. (Andrea kicked ass as this evil, chain-smoking centre operative in the pretender. She was hot. And evil. Now she has a new gig in some crap sitcom where she’s blond. She’s still evil but it's more in the comedy vein.)   I love the way drivers of Miata convertibles always wave at me. And if I see them first, I wave first and they always wave back. It’s like belonging to a really goofy club. I’ll bet Honda, SUV or Mercedes drivers don’t act like that.  Hey, you know how sometimes you really, really want something? Like a Vespa for example. You think it’s the coolest thing ever, in 50’s mint green like Annette Funicello rode in escapade in Florence or those gals in three coins in the fountain. Or maybe in 60’s blue like the wacky mods rode in Quadrophenia. All retro and shiny and perfect. You know you’ll never in a million years get the Vespa. The Vespa doesn’t know you exist. You are not worthy of the Vespa. The Vespa is only for the hip, happening kids. Yet still you foolishly dream of the Vespa. Then one day your friend has a Vespa. He’s pretty and smart, he stands up straight, he’s clever. He deserves the Vespa. He’s the epitome of hip and happening. And even though your head knows all of these things are true, it still hurts. It hurts a lot.  Random thoughts not comedy gold today?  No duh  McFly. You try to stay in the shallow end of the pool with the killing of the brain cells and the blond thoughts but unfortunately, on occasion, some few deadened feelings wake up. (Stupid feelings.) Or maybe it’s just hormonal, haggard insanity.
