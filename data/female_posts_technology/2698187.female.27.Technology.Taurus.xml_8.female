I am spent, bleary eyed, and bewildered...so what better time to write. This is my second time seeing this movie and I remember the first time shedding some tears, especially during the scene where they are at the stoplight--should I stay or should I go? This time I SOBBED. Tears were streaming down my face like someone poured a glass of water over my head. I cried so much my head hurts.   I guess its reflective of the state I'm in emotionally now. I want love so badly but I know I first need to love myself and I don't think I totally do. I want someone to love me for my own selfish needs instead of thinking how I can give love. I'm not sure I'm ready to give love in the way that it needs to be given. Yet, still inside of me, there is this burning....    Nobody understands...when a woman makes a choice to marry and have children...in one way her love begins..but in another way it stops. You build a life of details and just stop and stay steady so that your children can move...and when they leave they take your life of details with them. You're expected to move on and you don't remember what it was that moved you...because nobody has asked you in so long...even yourself.     Franchesca, Bridges of Madison County   I wonder if its still 50% of marriages that end in divorce. Is it because nobody stops to think about what it is REALLY about? Most people come into marriage so needy.   When Franchesca said what is written above, I was like ta-da. This is it. This is why I'm not ready. I want to move, I want to be asked what makes me move. Why do you have to get caught up in the details? But you do. And its my responsibility as a wife to tend to those details. My dreams have to be deferred so that my kids can move. That's the sacrifice you make and I think that anyone who believes different is kidding themselves. You may be able to strike some type of balance if you're lucky. But that kid, family..those details come first. That is what we're taxed with in holy matrimony. And I know that's not something I'm immediately prepared to accept.  But what about the meantime? What do I do with all this love I feel I have to give. Turn it inward? Give it to God? Those are the "right" answers. But what do I do with these tears that I've been evidentially holding in for so long? What do I do with this burn?
