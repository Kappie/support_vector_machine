He keeps it cool with the door shut and checks and waters them daily. He keeps them by the window with the shade drawn at night and in the morning, when the sun is shining, he draws the blind up so the tomatoes can get some sunlight. He is the biggest fanatic when it comes to his tomatoe plants. My dad last year had a tomato plant and I asked him what kind of plant that was. I thought it to be quite ugly myself. And that was the name of it. The Ugly Tomato. He has even had some yellow tomatoes and I have no idea what they are but they don't taste much different. He plants way too many tomato plants. He had people from all over town in gonvick, minnesota coming over for tomatoes and he has plenty. Gonvick is a small town. The population is around three-hundred. My mom does a lot of canning with tomatoes and uses them mostly when making chili. They sure are much better than store bought tomatoes. Sometimes when I stop over there will be tomatoes sliced on a plate on the table and I will eat some of them with a sprinkle of sugar on them. My dad will put salt and pepper on his and my three year old son will just take and eat them plain. My daughter, Brittany doesn't care for tomatoes much. Bridget, my oldest daughter does though. She will ask grandpa everytime we are there if she can have some tomatoes to take home and everytime he helps her to pick the best ones she can find. She also loves the cherry tomatoes. I'm not as big of a tomatoe fan but I do like them fresh from the garden for a B.L.T.
