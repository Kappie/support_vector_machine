So, this is my idea for a post Buffy project. Spike and Drusilla have a talk show! Sort of like Space ghost crossed with Regis and ex AMC star Kelly Ripa. But, you know, much more surly, belligerent and insane. Lots of tirades by Spike when Dru makes him crazy. And on special occasions Spike could present Dru with discombobulated body parts. “In honor of your 200th birthday Luv I’ve had Elton John turned. Now you can hear him play all the young girls love Alice to your dead hearts’ content.” “Oh Spike, he sparkles like all the fishies at the bottom of the gay, blue sea.” Oh! And they could have Andrew do special video reports. Then, when he would show up at the studio, Spike could threaten to strike him if he didn’t quit being such a poof and Dru could frighten him into wetting his pants. Any guest that sucked (say, Steve Guttenberg, Tom Cruise, Bijork, etc. blechity blech.) would be eaten. During musical performances Dru could roll around in the floor as if she were freebasing and Spike could clutch his head in his hands and/or chain smoke. Doesn’t that sound like the funniest thing  ever?!  (No Valerie, it does not. What it sounds like is you have too much free time, you’re way under supervised and you haven’t killed off enough brain cells with beer. Hurry up with that already.)
