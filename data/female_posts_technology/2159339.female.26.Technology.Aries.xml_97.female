I tried my best to pay attention in class and solved all the word problems about condensation of hydrogen molecules. But when I left I was completely miserable (about having to wait for the bus in the freezing cold) and so so tired. I thought back to five years ago. I was doing the same thing - working full time, going to cal, eating take-out with beau, seeing shows and coming home at 2 in the morning. But I had so much more energy back then. Where did it all go??!?! I'm only 25!! School and work are sucking the life out of me. Which reminds me, I have to work this weekend. Tonight I'm having dinner with Marcus. Will try to convince him to let me help run his clothing business. He keeps saying that I'll find it boring, but nothing is more boring than running financial reports on a Sunday afternoon. Nothing.  And Batty - I love you for the way you are, especially you orientalism and the fact that I can be racist around you, but I'm so sorry I don't have a penis to offer you.  My borrowed penis is back in 9 days.
