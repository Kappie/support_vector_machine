I revised my cover letter so I can induce some sparks and catch any attention worth catching! Boom, sent it. The next morning I got two responses. That was quick, really. I didn't match to their profile and requirements! What news - Life. Ack. Oh well, you win some, you lose all!       Work. I am still ZERO on the board.      Was nice to be back in the centrum of   Amsterdam  . Dutchman asked me to join dinner together with his business colleague from the UK, Matt er  Mister  Matt.   Leidseplein   was it... an intoxicating place. Beertje then Thai food. Uuummm nice for a change.... except that the waiting ladies took a long time to wait on us for the food to be served! Moreover, all I heard the whole evening was the ubiquitous and riotous word, " Mister ". Don't ask what it means because you'll never get it anyway. A niche in  Mister  Dutchman's world, kind of a secret boys club password.      And surprise surprise.... Pat called! It's been ages. We are getting together come Friday evening. Aaaahh friends...     bewitching.
