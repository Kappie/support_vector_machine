I was all happy and prepared for Shannons appearance, but at the end of the night when she didn't show (shocker) I was really down  REALLY  down.  I turned into that angry-depressed-sappy drunk and John and Jen witnessed it.  I guess I just want closure that I am never gonna get.  Oh well. Time for me to just move on and even if I do get the chance to just move on cause this has affected me so much in the past 4 months that it is changing the person that I am and not for the better. I am so angry these days and I hate it.  I have a show tonight. Nervous yet not. Just read Johns blog so that kind of upset me. He really thinks I am gonna sing flat. Thanks for the fuckin vote of confidence. I am gonna start working on me more and stop worrying about everybody else.  This is getting too crazy and I don't want to be that girl that everyone is saying "man that girl is nuts" Or maybe I was already nuts and it is just coming out now. From here on out I am worrying about me (and collen of course)I am going to take a journey of self discovery. That's it for now have to get ready to go.
