My best friend, we'll call her Rachel, found out she has fibroids on her ovaries. They are quite big: 8 cm, and 9 cm - on both ovaries.  She had an MRI done and learned that they are taking up so much space that if she were ever to get pregnant, the embryo wouldn't be able to grow - as there is no room for her uteros to expand. The fibroids take up all the room.   My favorite TV channel is Discovery Health. I can spend hours and hours and hours watching it, and never get bored.    [I think I was meant to be a doctor. I missed my calling. I always felt "right" in medical emergencies. Always calm, controlled. When I gave CPR to a biker girl who got thrown of the bike. When a colleague had an epilepsy attack]    My favorite show is "Moment of Impact". At the beginning of the show, they say something like "in a moment of impact, life can change...".  Last week, the story was one of a girl whose head got crushed between an elevator door and the wall - wiping her face and essentially crushing everybone in her skull. The story was of her amazing recovery. Her face is now... almost... normal. After years of surgery.   The week prior the show was of an athlete's busted knee. In a "moment of impact" all his life's work was gone. His life purpose had changed.     I just learned that my sister's mother in law had cancer. She recovered.      And I am obsessed with my weight. With cellulite, stretch marks, and a few extra kilograms.   Perspective.
