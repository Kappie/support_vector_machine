Things are a little rough getting everyone settled in, as well as focused upon their respective needs; but, hopefully, we won't end up being three bald folks by the time this upcoming semester is complete!!  That, certainly, won't be a pretty site!!   Right now, it is complicated by the fact that my daughter has lots of spyware programs downloaded on her computer through various sites she goes to download the documents.  We are running around fast and furious to make sure that it doesn't bring my computer down as well.  I have had enough down time during last term; I certainly don't want a repeat of that...  Pray for us??? at least, for all of us to keep our sanity.    My academic advisor forwarded this to me yesterday -- it is certainly well appreciated and applicable to our concerns at hand.      The other side    When your skills are challenged, you can become far more capable. When your beliefs are challenged they can become immensely more compelling and persuasive.   When your intentions are challenged, it can make you more determined and committed. When your faith is challenged, it can grow even stronger.   The downside of challenge is that it can be difficult to go through. The upside of challenge is that it's great to have been through.   When you arrive at a challenge, take a moment to look at it from the other side. Imagine all that will be gained by working your way through it.   The bigger and more imposing it appears when you first encounter it, the more value you'll have gained when the challenge is behind you. And that will set you up to conquer even bigger challenges, and to enjoy even more substantial rewards.   Give your best to the challenges. And what you get will be even better.   -- Ralph Marston
