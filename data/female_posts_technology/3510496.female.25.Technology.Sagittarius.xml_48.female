Not bad lahhh.  urlLink Lulu , you must be proud to have a good student like me, kan? For all the taggers, who were pleading for the pitas, am truly sorry. It's SOLD OUT on the spot. God's willing, in future, will share the recipe with you all, food-enthusiasts.  After the 8pm news on Suria, 3 siblings plus 1 BIL were cat-fighting on which boardgames for playtime. I chose Scrabble (being the *so-called* wordy person) and brother chose Ludo. Both of us lost to 2 votes by Sister and hubby, who insisted on playing the  Saidina  (Malaysia's rendition of Monopoly). If Parklane and Mayfair being the most expensive sites in UK rendition, it's Pulau Penang and KL for M'sia. My purchases included only those 2, adorned with houses and hotel, which was a 'curse  swear' affair for the other 3 players, every time the dices   brought them there.  Their cries is my pleasure . Close to midnight, I was the proclaimed  Saidina  (winner)  , with brother came in with a close fight in totals of our properties. Sister was the poor  Bankrap , who was also the Banker. Hahahhh!  Gosh... it's almost 3am. And I could see hubby still blink-blink open, counting sheeps perhaps  . Cialat, how to 'gear' up for 4 weddings later.
