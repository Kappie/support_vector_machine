I will pass it but  I have so much frustration and anger right now.  You sent me your Son and I'm so glad I've found my way to both of you! I know you hear my prayers. I know you feel what I feel. I want strength and I want courage. I want to see Jesus again. I love the feel of no fear, no anger, the feel of warm embrace, warm light and pure unconditional love.......... I remember you sent him because I called onto you. Come back to me.  Show me the way.  Amen.
