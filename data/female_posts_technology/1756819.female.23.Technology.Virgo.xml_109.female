They were taking nominations, and there were some people who were interested in the position.  But there was a catch.  The job would be in England.  Most people weren't too happy about that, but I thought, hey, sounds great!  So I got my name on the list.  I remember it saying something about my not having any advanced mathematics, but that I would be a quick learner.  Unfortunately I woke up before I found out if I would be moving to England or not.
