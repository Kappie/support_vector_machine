I never felt anything like this before about my work. I am always being praised for being conscientious and an able employee but now...it seems no one apart from my department people, felt I am up to the work.  I have been here for less than 3 months and I am thinking of quitting. Should I have stayed on in the last place? At least I am being regard as ' important ' there.  The situation now is actually encouraging me to leave this work and proceed with my plan to find work in NZ. I have nothing to look forward here... except being make a scapegoat by the two main people from another dept.  Hrmmn...talking about NZ, I actually plan to migrate there but I need to have a job offer first. After weeks and weeks of job hunting and dozens of mail sent out to the Immigration Consultants, I am now stuck. It seems that I will need to be in NZ itself in order to apply for work. But before I resign from my current job, pack my stuff and leave for NZ -- I will feel more secure if I am able to know whether I will have interviews to attend to, while I am on holiday there. The most, I can take 2 weeks unpaid leave. I would like to know my percentage of getting a job before I leave everything here. It is risky to resign and hop to NZ and come back without a job here. But I think that is how this world works. You got to lose something before you can gain what you wish for. I see myself in a win-lose situation here.  I have no one to talk to, no one to discuss with... Yes, I do have friends but I am worried they will just dampen my spirit. I tried telling to one of my friend which holds a Oz PR. She was saying, by going there...you will be considered a second class citizen. And I can't tell a very close friend of mine...for we are working in the same place and she is very close to the management. I do trust her but I just can't bring myself to discuss it with her.  And this is part of the reason why I have decided to blog. I can just pour my worries all to here.  p/s: I have already bought my air ticket but I have not made up my mind on the return date yet.
