I basically did nothing but fix up my room a bit and finally got rid of a bunch of stuff.I mostly just have to clear out my closet and finish up with the rest of the posters that need to be put away. I got most of em. Other than that I sat on my ass in the morning and watched a few dramatic movies and cried my brains out to them cuz I'm a sap. Yeah...i had cookies for breakfast *tear* and now they're all gone! Hahaha...       So later on today Kevin ended up showing me a giant box from across the street cuz I can see into his friend Jeff's window the house behind the one in front of me. Yep, the box was big enough for me to put my stuff in. I ended up putting my stuffed animals and junk in it. So what happened next? Hmm...Kev came over at about ten or so and we hooked the Cube back up to my tv in what's left of my room. Suddenly I started talking to Katy, Amanda and my brother online. In attempt to show katy what my room looked like, she turned on her cam when i turned on mine and Kevin saw. Yep, he was like "Yo man! She's hot! Invite her over!" Freakishly enough, we picked her up at midnight and we jumped in the hot tub...for...well...y'know how you're only suposed to be in the hot tub for 30 minutes? When we got out and everyone was raiding my fridge, I noticed the time was after 3 am...we were in there for over 2 hours. It was actually really relaxing. I ended up looking at the stars for a long time. Hey! I even got a foot massage from both of them! Ha! Then Kevin kept talkin bout threesomes, telling me and katy to kiss and stuff like that. Then I asked him if he would get mad if I slept with his friend, jsut as a teaser. Hm...That was funny. Anywho, KEvin ended up taking his shorts off while in the hot tub and wanted katy and I to take off our shirts. I did, but I kept my sports bra on hahaha. Katy did for a short time but remained in the water with her hands over her chest. So ha to that.  Afterwards, we headed out to mcdee's and sat back for a short meal. Mmm late night fast food...I took the video camera along and bumped into mario. Haven't seen him in a while. Him and Cintia are still together. They've always been such a cute couple. When i first met mario i remember him and I raiding Becky's famous brownies at Lisa's party. Hmm...i could go for sum junkfood like brownies now...but my stomache hurts and I wanna go to bed.I have to finish my room tomorrow and I gotta work at 6 too.  Well, I'm off to bed. Another akward but very fun night. I hope there's more to come.   The Road ahead is long and winding.  -The Lonewolf
