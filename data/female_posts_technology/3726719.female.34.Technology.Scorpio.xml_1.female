Sigh...I'm a girl, guess it's to be expected occassionally.  And I have actually had men interested in me.  Unfortunately the feeling wasn't mutual.  Go figure.  I'm having a busy day at the office with meetings and document updates.  Lots to get done before next weeks vacation.    At this point I'm looking forward to soaking up the sun in my pool on the patio.  Ahhhhhhhh.....the simple things in life.  :o)
