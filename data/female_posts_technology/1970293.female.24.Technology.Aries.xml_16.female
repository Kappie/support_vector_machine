This one's for the girls.  This is for all you girls, about twenty-five. In little apartments just tryin' to get by. Livin' on, on dreams and Spaghettios. Wonderin' where your life is gonna go.  This one's for the girls, Who've ever had a broken heart; Who've wished upon a shootin' star: You're beautiful the way you are. This one's for the girls, Who love without holdin' back; Who dream with everything they have. All around the world, This one's for the girls. (This one's for all the girls.)  This is for all you girls, about forty-two. Tossin' pennies into the fountain of youth. Every laugh, laugh line on your face, Made you who you are today.  This one's for the girls, Who've ever had a broken heart; Who've wished upon a shootin' star: You're beautiful the way you are. This one's for the girls, Who love without holdin' back; Who dream with everything they have. All around the world: This one's for the girls.  Yeah, we're all the same inside (Same inside.) From one to ninety-nine:  This one's for the girls, Who've ever had a broken heart; Who've wished upon a shootin' star: You're beautiful the way you are. This one's for the girls, Who love without holdin' back; Who dream with everything they have. All around the world, yeah, This one's for the girls. (This one's for all the girls.)  Yeah, this one's for the girls. (This one's for all the girls.)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Another excellent song.  This one evokes a feeling of bond with all the girls in the world.    All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003
