We were to go to Lao Beijing but I overlooked the fact that the NKF coupon could not be used on high-tea buffet..so there goes our hopes *%#@!  The food at the restaurant was delicious. Well, I am glad that we went as I bet the dim sum that we ate would be of no less quality compared to that of Lao Beijing. Most importantly, dad and mum looked rather happy.  Zec told me that I do not need to work Ot today at the very last minute. In one sense, I felt happy as I do not need to rush to work and work 24 hours NONSTOPPED but on the other hand, I felt sad that I would not be able to earn 2 times OT. Nah...I should comfort myself that I could sit comfortably at home to type my things out rather than at work.  Bro has just gone back to Thailand tonight. Dad and mum decided to send him off although he insisted that we do not need to. I felt that I have too much work to do..so I decide not to go. Moreover, he will be back in a month's time soon too.  I had a shopping haul today. Bought a pair of ballet shoes, facial products and 25 hangers to re-organize my own cupboard. My cupboard seems very much tidier now. All thanks to brother's recommendation to buy the hangers. I realized that mum's remarks on my clothes are indeed true. I really have too much clothes!!! Damn it....I think I have tons of t-shirts in my cupboard. They are practical. I could wear them for daily purposes but as I work, I need more formal kinds of clothes which I do not possess much. On the other hand, I think I should keep a low profile at the moment. I don't want to change my wardrobe overnight. It would be too much...I can survive with mix-and match for the time being.  Read on JH's blog again...she was lamenting over some heart affairs. Sometimes I do think that I know what she means. I am also wondering whether I do feel anything for him. Although I am able to change topics swiftly when he asked me how come I am especially nice towards him, I could not help to wonder why I am so. I just could not help but being nice to him. However, on the other hand, I know if we come together, we would not be able to last long...Our lifestyles are not really accomodating towards each other and our perceptions are not really the same...I believe I do have feelings for him but the feelings have faded away gradually within this past year...I could carry my life on without him in the picture much...though sometimes his image does float into my mind and it brings me warmth. Self-indulgence? Yes it is but it is not a crime.
