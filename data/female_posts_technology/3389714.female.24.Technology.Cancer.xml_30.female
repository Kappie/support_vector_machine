I managed to softly say “11” and he flexed out his tender hard muscles to the elevator button labeled “11” that’s when I got a whiff of his freshly wash head and shoulder shampooed hair… I was in heaven.. nothing could spoil today… then due to my horrid luck once again in a super possessed elevator designed by Satan himself.. oh my god it was gross.. he lifted his right hand from his right suit pant pocket and reached behind himself and tugged…. U got it.. he bloody just picked a freaking wedgie right in front of me in a freaking elevator.. the man had no shame.. my brain went dead ..and the tacky hindi music stopped playing and me and him stopped dancing in the rain… reality hit and my daydream was brutally interrupted by is delicate fingers picking at his tighty whities… i was beyond disgusted.. the elevator now stopped and I had a huge frown on my face.. I walked out of the lift…without looking back… and remembered Newton’s 3rd law to every action there is an opposite and equal reaction.. to every thing good there is something as equally bad… I just proved this law in an elevator no bigger then 5ft by 5ft… gorgeous guy picks wedgie.. what a turn off.. looks like I’m going to have to put ice on it today.. poo…   Definition of WEDGIE: (The condition of having one's clothing stuck between the buttocks)    Question of the Day….   What’s the most gruesome act you’ve seen committed in an elevator…?
