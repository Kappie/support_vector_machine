 At least the workshop that I was in charge of today went well.  Really well, in fact, I was afraid that no one would show, or that my lack of planning would be evident, but it was well-attended and everything went smoothly.  The presenter was to thank for it really, he was excellent.  I guess that's the secret of really being a good leader: know how to find good people!  
 So now I can relax for a little while, right?  At least until my math test on Friday and the ACM programming competition on Saturday...
