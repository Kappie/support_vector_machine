Yet I find myself, more often than not, engaging in the somewhat childish act of wishing a certain person (we'll call him Ralph) terrible illnesses and a gruesome death.   This Ralph person has made my family's life a living hell for the past several years.  I could write a book about the things he'd done. The book would become an instant best seller. Ralph would be arrested and probably jailed. (Not a bad idea, I might share some horrid juicy details of Ralph's wrongdoings in some other blog. I am too furious to do it now).   So yes, it is probably immature. It may be sadistic and it may be against the morals I have been taught.  But I do. I wish him dead. I wish him in pain.   And in lieu of a more physical action I could take, I found  urlLink this   to vent my anger on.  Didnt help much, I must admit.
