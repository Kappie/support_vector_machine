On Monday and Tuesday night of last week, TCSSC members urinated in the sandbox and other nearby areas prior to and during their games at Fieldstone. The sandbox is used as a play area for students. School officials spotted these individuals first-hand and immediately brought the health and safety issues to our attention. As a result, Fieldstone has issued a final warning to the TCSSC.   Fortunately, the school will be allowing us to continue using the field in the near future. As a condition for this, the TCSSC has had to (1) replace the sand in the sandbox, and (2) install a "port-o-potty" on site. A padlock will remain on the door - the combination is 21-35-13 (this will also be posted at the location description for Fieldstone at our website). The port-o-potty will be serviced on a weekly basis; combined with the padlock, it will be suitable for the needs of our members for washroom needs.   After I read this, my first reaction was "What is wrong with these people? Have they no common decency?" Then I realize something, there are NO washrooms at any of the outdoor fields we play at, and our games last 1 1/2 hour. So what's one to do when nature calls? I am not saying that it was right to urinate everywhere, but TCSSC should really reconsider the kind of facilities they are providing.
