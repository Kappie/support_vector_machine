It's inevitable that they will wilt and die so I'm trying to figure whether to put them out of their misery now and send them to trash purgatory or let them stand tall for a little while longer.  Hmmmm....I think I'll wait another day.  Despite their slow wilt, they still smell wonderful.  My title was very misleading...don't shoot me.
