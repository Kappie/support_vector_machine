Its not those emotional-lovey-dovey-high-sex-hormone show. I would think it's more realistic-bitchy-sexy-unscrupulous-scandalous show. Well, that's what it's about anyway. Girls bitching about each other, using underhand methods to sabotage, trying to be in the "in" group, etc. Hmm. that's what most college students are facing.   Story: A newbie to the school, who eventually joined the most popular girls of the school but for ulterior motive. That is, to get the boy she admires in class. So she went about to sabotage on the "Queen" of that group. Before she knows it, she has become one of them, and landed herself in more problems. But of cos, such movie always ends happilywith a prom. ;) No need to guess, everyone bcomes good friends again. (Duh!) Hhaha  Well, I think this is about 2.5/5. Funny, but it's a teen movie! and teen movies cannot go beyond 2.5.
