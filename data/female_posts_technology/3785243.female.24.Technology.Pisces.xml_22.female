I craved Asian food today and was looking for something different from the normal Chinese stir fry and Japanese sushi that is so readily available in my area.  So I found something new to try, steamed buns!  Step aside, Krispy Kremes!  Here are some links to general sites about Philippine culture and food.     urlLink Discover Philippines->Culture->Food   urlLink Evolution of Food Dishes in the Phillipines   urlLink Steamed Bun (Siopao) Recipe 1 (with pictures)   urlLink Asian Breads (includes Bibingka and Puto Bread)   There are a lot of great foods from the different parts of Asia that never see the light of day here in the US.  I remember taking my diving certification and a sweet young Korean couple cooking stir fry from fresh ingredients they had brought with them for the trip.  They kindly offered me some stir fry and sweet kimchi.  I wasn't too sure what to expect with the kimchi (fermented cabbage), but I just kept in mind that it was basically Korean sauerkraut as I ate it.  Sure enough, to my happy surprise, I really enjoyed it!  --  Aeryth
