I notice the posting has slowe down.. PEOPLE! LOG THE BLOG! Or maybe I'm just too free. Haha.   How did ur wkend go? I went to KL/Genting. It was pretty cold up at Genting and crowded too. It's my first time there. The trip up was pretty interesting as we took the wrong turn and end up driving the deserted 'scenic' route, away from the highway and toll. Of cos, played at the casino and won RM75 at the "Money Wheel" (the wheel of fortune kinda thing). If it wasn't time to go, I would have continue to try to win the RM200 I had won before that. Greed!! U can never beat the odds eh?
