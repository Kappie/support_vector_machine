For anyone that has ever worked around children this is often the main goal. I know that it has been my goal as a future educator.   My goal is to see the children thrive. But I also want to protect them for the harsh reality that we now live in. I don't belive that at the age of five or even six they should have to understand what an attack on U.S. soil is, abduction, or murder is. Their main concerns should be learning, and interacting with kids their own age. But the reality is in this day and age that is something that they learn. I have worked with many kids through my work study program in high school and I have noticed the importance of how a kid needs to be a kid. A child that is forced to grow up to fast is not healthy for any one exspecially the child. As teachers we should help children to be kids.   They only time that they should be a grown-up is when they are playing dress up and acting like one. Children that have play grown -up to soon is devistating and can even cause problems later in life. When they are actual grown-ups they don't know what the meaning of fun is. All they do is work. Their life turns into work. Trust me that was me a few years ago. I never went out with friends or even to school funtions. I thought to my self why bother. No one at school has the same goals in life as I did. At this time I was also fighting a battle with depression. That had been going on for a while. Then in eight grade I snaped I just could not take it any more.  After spending 48 hours in lock down I took a good long look at my life and the direction that it was headed in and made many changes in my life. Like instead of going out I just wanted time to my self. I had friends but now it seemed that they did not share the same goals as I did. That was until I moved to Bagley and met my two best friends Tarah and Leah they showed me that I should not let my depression get the best of me. They have been through everything with me and they are there when I need someone just to complain to. Just as I am there for them.  Then in 11th grade I started to go up to the elementary school and worked with the kindergardeners on a daily basis this helped me face many of the problems that I was facing because I saw them sruggling and it made me feel better because I could help my self over come my fear by helping them with their's. Weather it be learning to read and write to the simplist task of tieing a shoe. It both of us happy when I helped them learn a skill that they are going to use in everyday day life. So no matter who you are you the simplist way that you can help a child thrive is by just being their to help them if they have a problem.
