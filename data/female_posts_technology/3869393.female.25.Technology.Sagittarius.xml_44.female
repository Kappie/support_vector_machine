This grandfather was one of those cool grandparents I had, really cool guy, smart cookie and amazing in vedic maths.  He had been suffering with Spinal Cancer for over 1 year and really everyone knew his days were numbered.  Guess I just didnt want it to happen so fast!  Anyway, could hardly sleep after that.   Began my day with an hour of SS Music.  Was quite surprised, coz these guys too play some good music in the mornings.  Heard this song from Def leppord, been an age....kindof brought me to tears...probably my next post would have to be this song...."two steps behind"...one really moving song..and then heard songs from Micheal Bolton, 'when a man loves a woman", Rod stewart, Bryan adams, Sting, " All for love", From the OST of Alladin, "whole new world", George Micheal " jesus to a child"  finally Duran Duran" ordinary World".  Had to have some of the new medicines this morning, and man, are the terrible medicines or what, I almost feel as though I have morning sickness!!! Yuck..totally disgusting...!  This is the heights of non sense in my life, my eyes are burning like crazy because of the lack of sleep, my stomach is behaving like a rollacoaster, and I feel like I'm living in the theory of constraints!
