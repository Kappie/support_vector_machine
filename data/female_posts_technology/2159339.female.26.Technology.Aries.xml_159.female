Put on rest of  ingredients all at once. Place tiny multicolored light between lips and play contraption that looks like cross between traffic light and motherboard. Cull sounds of heavenly Hallelujah choruses, souls in hell, and apocalyptic chaos. Ask your friend Abby "What does this all mean?" Hear her say slowly and gravely, "I think it means you're the devil."
