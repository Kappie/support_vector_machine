It's about cool sites where they think they can label you based on certain criteria....  http:// urlLink www.hilowitz.com/john/test/html.php  According to this site --> You are 28% evil(Me, not you, dear reader :P)--> You try to stay away from evil deeds but succumb to temptation every once in a while. You aren't quite on your way to hell but you certainly have some explaining to do.   urlLink http://www.blazonry.com/scripting/usname.php  According to this site, my US names can be any of the following (Note: I used variations of my real name and my nickname with my last name):  Suzanne Curry (I don't even like curry!) Vanessa Austin (me likey!) Joan Warner (sounds very average) Katie Barber (model? porn star?)  'Yan muna. Let me know if you got a kick out of it too :P
