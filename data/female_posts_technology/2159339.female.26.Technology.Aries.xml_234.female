He took out a bag and reached inside. He handed me a mini-Eiffel Tower. We walked to get lunch and I said, "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have kissed you." He said, what you don't want to get into that again? I said nothing. He smiled and said what, you got a fella now? and I shrugged.  I don't have anybody. But I'd rather have nobody than somebody who gives me a stupid nothing.  Later he said he wanted to take me out on a date and I said no thanks. He said what's wrong? What's changed?  And I said, "I think I deserve better."
