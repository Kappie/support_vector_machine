To recap my weekend:   Friday - I didn't have ice cream, nor, quite frankly, was I really tempted after hearing Bryan and Andrew snicker about which one of us was going to cave first. (That's why we had to speak up, Kate! I'm sorry!) I had a couple of fat-free oreos on the way home and had a pre-cooked skinless chicken breast with some corn chutney before the game. We lost the game, but I did run around the bases at least once when Rick hit a homerun! After the game, we went to Lone Star and I had 3 steak fajitas, light on the sour cream and cheese. I didn't have chili (which I normally do) but I did take a couple of bites of Rick's garlic toast and I had a virgin raspberry margarita (no sugar rim). Its all about the compromise, folks!   Saturday - I had a sushi lunch (c'mon, can you get more low fat that fish and a little rice?), but I had prime rib for dinner. I made sure to have the leanest cut I could get, though and I had a big bowl of swiss chard from my garden (Yay! I'm starting to harvest veggies!). I didn't even have any snack... hmm... I did better that day than I thought! I forgot my vitamin, though... but I did some walking and gardening, which got me out of the house.   Sunday - oops, I had bacon and eggs for breakfast. But, I only had 3 strips of bacon, burnt to a crisp so there wasn't much fat left on it, and brown toast. I had coffee, but only with 1 cream, and I ate my tomatoes on the side, instead of the hashbrowns. Plus a big glass of OJ. While I was cooking dinner that night, I had a flatbread with spinach cream cheese as a snack (I hadn't had anything to eat since breakfast). For dinner, I had two beef souvlaki skewers, seasoned rice and sliced tomatoes for dinner, with some sour cream. Again, no snacking. I didn't get out to exercise, although I did go up and down the stairs in my house about two dozen times doing laundry, plus lifting weights, stretching, and doing all of 11 sit ups.   So, in retrospect, how did I do? I'll give myself a "B". I didn't exercise as much as I wanted, but my eating was pretty good, and I managed the stretching and vitamin 6 out of 7 days. I pretty much avoided junk food, and when I DID go out to eat, I compromised between what I really wanted and what was good for me. I'm not sure that my weigh-in tomorrow is going to be great, but its a good start.
