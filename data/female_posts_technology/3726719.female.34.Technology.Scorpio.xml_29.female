It's called the universal message of "wanting."  By sending out that vibe, that's what comes back, the vibe of wanting.  I know, deep thoughts explained in a shallow way.  Whatever.  So I've been giving this online dating thing a try.  I've met a few people.  Nothing major.  I have met a "special" friend that has come in handy on a couple of occassions.  Nothing serious, just the right kind of fun.  Many women may experience this, I however can only speak for me.  When "that time of the month" is done, I'm out of my mind with a craving for something that isn't chocolate!   It's what I would imagine it's like for a werewolf during a full moon.  As it turns out, timing really is everything.  My one and only special friend was out of town.  And still is.        Enter Melanie's frustration at the cruelness of life!!  :o))   That friend is suppose to be back in town Sunday night.  Hopefully Monday evening will take care of my craving issues.  And the wait is for Monday, because I have gone from a time when nobody was around or even had my number, to a weekend of dates.  Three nights - three different guys.   Who gets how this happens!?!?!?!?  :)   Hopefully one of these bloks will turn out to be a wonderful presence to add to my life.....maybe even with some benefits.  They've all got potential.  I really like the idea of not having to introduce myself to anyone else ever again!!!!   Boy does that take a lot of energy.   As for this weekend....well I'll be happy to get a regular date out of one of these meetings.   Of course I have a preference, however after the disaster date a few weeks ago, I know nothing is a sure bet!
