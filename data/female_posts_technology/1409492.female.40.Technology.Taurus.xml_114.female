I would like to add my voice of protest against slicing any wienies. Unless it's Harvey Keitel again. Seen enough of you, thanks.    Micturating  is a $2.50 way of saying "urinating". The things I learn from James Lileks!   Claritin and ephedrine  probably shouldn't be mixed.   The sequel  to  Dungeons  Dragons , a godawful movie, is purported to have Paris Hilton. I  will  watch, maybe even buy a DVD of this sequel, if someone assembles a ballistae behind her and shoots her with it.   Game # 178  of the XP version of FreeCell is a major ass-kicker. I finally solved it, though.   The movie  Powers that Be are not going to show the  Batman Begins  teaser in front of  Spiderman II . Instead, it will be shown in front of  Catwoman , which is supposed to stink like a wet litterbox in a hot garage. What trailer will we see in front of  Spiderman II ?  Catwoman , of course.   Gary Oldman  is doing the voice of Darth Obvious. Or something like that. Bad guy for the third movie. He will always be Sid to me.   I still  can't smell anything. My doctor's appointment is next Wednesday.    I'm still bored . Can't you tell?   Richard "Master Thespian" Burton  ran like a girl. Boy I'm in a snippy mood.
