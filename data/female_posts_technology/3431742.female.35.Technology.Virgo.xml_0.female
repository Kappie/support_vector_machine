Was fun to take a mini-nap with my baby girl.  she's so adorable sometimes.  it's even more great when it rains.  TV cool stuff: On June 6th two shows will be coming back that I love!  MONK and The Dead Zone.  Sad news: Jerry Orbach is leaving Law  Order.  I guess he's done like 12 seasons.  He started with the show.  It's going to be weird without him on it.  I'll so miss him.  Thank god he'll be on another new spin off tho.  Now for the soap box.  Remember I warned ya.  I whole-heartly believe that if the USA will get their head out of their ass AND out of everyone else's business we might actually be able to get out of our Trillion/zillion dollar debt. As the quote is going around lately:  "The war is only over for those that have died."  I say get a Woman as president and this shit wouldn't even be happening!  I find it really great that our own weapons are being used against us.  Also finding out that we trained most of them here in the States and now the training is being used against us as well.  WTF!  Info gathering question:  Have you ever fell in love or loved someone and not told them?  Salute to all those that have served, to those that are currently serving, and to those that will choose to serve in the future.  A huge thank you to those that have fallen.  You will not be forgotten.
