Did you guys know it was the Philippines Independence Day last Saturday? Well our little Filipino community had a santacruzan to accompany it. My mom was Reyna Elena.... bonga mother ko! *. -Empanadas! Got 'em flown from Chicago by my dad who attended a wedding there. They were a day old, so they were not in top form, but still... -Pictures, pictures, pictures! I'll be posting lots of them hopefully by tomorrow.   Abangan! **   Bedroom Fortunes   And to tide us over until tomorrow (hehehehe), here are some fortunes to laugh over. Remember the rule: add  in bed  at the end of your fortunes.  -Keep up the good work! in bed ! -What we love to do, we find time to do  in bed ! (Ain't this the truth!).    *Ain't my mother grand!     **Watch out for it!
