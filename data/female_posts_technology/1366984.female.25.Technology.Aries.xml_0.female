I forget time, don't register anything, and the sun keeps on cooking me!  I'm red now. I have to go kajaking in some hours, and have to face the sun again. I don't know if it's wise, but I love my Kajak.  Someone tried to start a fire today...and I came to the conclusion that I must sufer from pyromania. Someone had obviously enjoyed a cigarette. And left it on the dry grass. I was lying there, after finishing my studies, and juuust wanted to relax. I was REALLY enjoying life and the birds were singing, my body was feeling all numb from the sun, I was gettign so tired and sleepy by the wind caresing my face...when I turned, it was there! Smoke was coming out of the grass!!  I did   nothing! Just looked at it and observed it, while the smoke was rising up the air. The smoke was getting white and thick. I looked how it danced up it way into the amazingly beautiful, bright blue sky. I was fascinated of the structure of the smoke, although my heart raced wildly, since I knew this probably wasn't good. I was devouring the smell of burnt grass or what reminded me of wood. The smell took my right back to excursions in the wood, where one had to try to start a bonfire.  All of sudden the smoke stopped. The cigarette had finished burning and I was left with an empty sensation of loneliness-I had attached myself to the burning cigarette..I had had all these strange visions in my head of sirens, ambulance, firedepartments hunky guys and my flat burning and people yelling. A little 9/11 scenario in this little suburb of Copenhagen.  I was kinda disappointed that nothing had happened, that the vision of me being the Cigarette hero, pouring my last drops of water onto the dangerous little butt of cigarette, had vanished in thin air.  Then I wondered if all those previous toxines from my early smokingdays, really had me all screwed up?  Smoking really IS bad for you...
