Although he wasn't fortunate enough to get to meet me.  ;)  Seriously, he and I and the other 800 people there really enjoyed ourselves.  I took a picture - I'll post when I'm back.  He's about a speck in the distance, but you can tell it's him.  Here's the full  urlLink speech  he gave.  So I want this day to be over.  Karen Hughes is speaking at this morning's general session, as her plane was delayed and she missed dinner last night.  But I'm hanging at the Internet Caf, which turned out pretty cool.  I guess I can take pics of that as well...  But right now I'm just too tired to worry about it...
