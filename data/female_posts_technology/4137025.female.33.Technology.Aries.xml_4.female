Got my bloodwork results back---everything is okay---but that doesn't explain why i feel so lousy.  Went to the gyno--not so bad.  Highlight of yesterday was that Ed came over to say hello.  Going out with him Friday.  Today...notified about some trouble on the workfront with 2 employees.  have decided to suspend them both for 3 days without pay.  that's no fun and not something i enjoy doing but need to show them that their behavior is unacceptable.  so, my stress level is pretty darn high today.  not good.  i know i need to relax.  going to dinner tonight with seymour (deborah), kristen and nick.  should be interesting.  kristen and i aren't real thrilled about the deborah saga but are trying to be supportive of seymour.
