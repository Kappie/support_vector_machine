If I was a Jeopardy category, I would be 1980s Vintage Microcomputer Trivia.  Ok, maybe Obscure Early Internet History too...    When I was a little kid, I wanted to be a geneticist.  I thought it would be fun to manipulate genetic code to change how ordinary things look (peaches with real hair!).  I settled for working with computer code and manipulating data instead.  I have 4 Macs at home for fun and code on a PC at work (a polyglot, I know C/C++, Java, VB, and all sorts of stuff).  I am a small, white female with ghostly pale skin, big eyes, and brown-blonde hair.      I have a secret life pursuing a nursing degree (few know I plan to retire as an engineer soon).  I hate being called a hacker, geek, etc. and tell people so to their face.    My blog is intended simply for recording random thoughts.  Maybe something beautiful will come out of the randomness, like a Mandelbrot fractal in prose.    -- Aeryth
