On Tuesday I spent the entire day in the back of shipping, prepping boxes of See's chocolates to be shipped out to the company's customers. I accepted the sad fact that I would not see XX because of my imprisoned state. But for some strange reason he came back to talk to the other admins about something or other. I was deathly quiet the whole time because I felt my face grow hot and I was suddenly self-conscious of the task I was doing. I was at the cutting board slicing cardstock in half. Each half had a message surrounded by a bright pointsettia border. The message read: "In the spirit of the holiday season, please share these with your staff members."  Isn't that a bossy fucked-up message? It's implying that humans are essentially selfish pigs and need to be reminded to share. I was embarrassed that I was cutting up these stupid cards.   Anyway, the cat got my tongue like a howly bitch, and in my mind, I was like, "Damn you, self, can't you think of anything to say? Goddamnit, think of something to say! Something! Anything!" But no words came. Nothing clever, in fact, nothing at all. So since I was being retardedly cripplingly shy, I smiled during the jokes and smiled at myself smiling during the jokes like a socially retarded shyfuck cripple.  The back of shipping has a wall that is a chain-link fence. On the other side is the set-up room where computer people fiddle with computers. Later on I was alone in shipping for a while and we saw each other through the fence. I stuck out my tongue at him like the socially graceful adult I am, and he stuck out his tongue at me then we started talking. We talked through the fence for a while and I felt like I was falling in love with a convict. I pictured a rough future replete with sex through the fence and trying to smuggle him knives implanted in hot dogs.  He asked me if I wanted to hang out in the set-up room while he boxed up a computer and I said sure. We chatted and made jokes and I was very charming and talkative because my brain was trying to ignore all the signals coming from below my waist. If I was a guy I would've been completely rude and boorish because a big fat boner would've been bulging through my pants. Fortunately, I am a girl, so my boners are internal and thus, invisible to innocent office hotties. I know what you are wondering. Why didn't you guys just make out? It's because there were two other people in the room. And they were giving us glances like, "These two horndogs are gonna doo it and make fuckin UNIX babies back here."
