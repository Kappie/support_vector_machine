I  love  lists. Love making them I mean. If I have a list I can face the day with anal-retentive gladness in my heart. Plus I don’t have to keep all that crap in my brain. This plan should keep me busy and off the streets for a few minutes at least.  List #1: Observations about the dollar store I adore the dollar store. Maybe it’s the white trash in me but I love spending $12 and getting a bag of crap so heavy I can hardly carry it to my car.    Why is everything at the dollar store sticky?  Ew , thank goodness they also sell wet naps.  Don’t buy undershirts at the dollar store. Wherever they manufacture them a mens size 46-48 chest does not equal an American mens size 46-48 chest.   Other things you should not buy at the dollar store-bras, make-up (lip gloss, lip balm and nail polish are ok), hair dye, hair care products. Sometimes, quality matters.  The foodstuffs are exotic and foreign. And sometimes the package is only in a foreign language.  If you buy something and discover you really, really like it, go back immediately and buy all they have. If it’s so damn excellent then they will never carry it again.  Great candy! I don’t really like candy unless it’s weird. And boy, dollar store candy is weird. Ginger flavored mints. Gum that was the bomb when I was seven. Stuff so hot you’d think it was mislabeled as candy and should in fact be labeled as hot ass spicing.   Don’t ask the stock people where stuff is. It makes them anxious and it confuses you. I ask for eyeglass repair kits and get sent to NSYC coloring books. Ask the owners, they even remember what was on aisle 4, 3rd shelf down six months ago.  Sometimes, mostly around the holidays, they give you coupons. 6 pieces of crap for the price of 5, gak!  If you only go once a month, it’s like a whole new store the next time you go back.
