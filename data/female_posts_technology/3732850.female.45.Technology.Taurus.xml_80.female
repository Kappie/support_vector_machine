I want to plant them in my world tenderly care for them, helping them to grow healthy and strong. I want to build a fence around them and protect them from the harsh elements of life.” It would be so much easier as a parent to be able to protect our children from anything that hurts or disappoints them. If we could only create a perfect little world for our children filled with love, happiness, success and good fortune.   As a parent of a child with “special needs”, I have found this statement to be true so many times. I have had to stand back and watch my son be disappointed, rejected and taken advantage of. I have watched him try so hard to be just like the other kids but never quite succeed. I have watched him fill out job applications with miss-spelled words and almost impossible to read handwriting, because he wanted to do it all by himself. I have watched his disappointment when the phone did not ring for an interview after all the time spent filling out those applications with the miss-spelled words and the messy handwriting. I have watched him stand in the doorway of the dugout cheering on his baseball team because the coaches would not put him in the game because all they were thinking about was winning. I have listened to the excuses he made for them saying, “It’s okay. There just wasn’t enough time for me to get in the game mom.”   One day I went to pick my son up at school for a doctor’s appointment, he came out of school with different clothes on than he had left the house with. When I asked him what  happened, he informed me that when he got back to his gym locker, his clothes were gone. He had to get dirty clothes out of the lost and found to replace the ones that had been stolen from him. I asked him how that could have happened if he had locked his locker. He said, “I couldn’t get the lock to work so I laid it on top of the locker where it would be safe. I didn’t want the guys to have to wait for me.” He knew I was upset about his missing clothes. He tried to comfort me by saying, “It’s okay mom, someone else must have needed my clothes.” He was so forgiving. Somehow he always finds the positive side of any situation.  As parents, it is our nature to want to protect our children from hurt and disappointment. However by allowing them to experience the hurt and disappointment, it helps them learn to be better people. Our son is compassionate, forgiving and full of never-ending love. He is not judgmental or prejudice. He accepts people for what they are. He survived the harsh elements of life.
