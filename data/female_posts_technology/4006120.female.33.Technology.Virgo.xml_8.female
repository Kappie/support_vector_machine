Budz and Barbi went to see Eric Clapton (lucky dawgs) in San Jose Saturday night. It was her "Father's Day belated present", very cool, huh? He wanted me to go and I would have loved to but I thought it would be great for them to spend some father-daughter time...it's been a while since they went to a concert together. And hey, we can always watch Eric Clapton next time around. They sure had a wondeful time!  It was actually kinda nice to get to hang-out with one of my good and oldest friend Tata again. We were co-workers and roommates back in the Philippines eleven years ago. She was also my old boss at work for a year or so until she quit about a year and a half ago. We and her hubby Juan used to hang-out a lot at my old place on weekends when I was living by myself. I remember the booze, munchies, 80's music, and a lot of old stories to tell and re-tell. It was fun, we always have a blast!   urlLink     Me and Tata. Bantayan Island, Cebu. 1993.   I scored some adobo cebu-style with the fish sauce dip and beef green currry for dinner and some cassava and torta cake for dessert last night (yums tums!). She's a very good cook. We always make sure we don't miss her parties. It's almost like a cardinal sin to decline or refuse her invitation.   urlLink     And another.   So anyway, we thought we'd take advantage of my little night out. We had a couple shots of vodka cranberry and some munchies while "story-telling-a-lie" as my mum would say while gazing at the beautiful blue moon until midnight.  I was home 6 seconds after Budz and Barb pulled into the garage. Perfect timing!  Today was easy like a Sunday morning. The whole day was actually -- very relaxing. We drove around and see if we hit some cool garage sales in the neighbourhood earlier today, but no luck. We did some chores around the house, watched tv and just kicked back until 5pm then headed on out for Budz's family dinner party.  We get to play and smooch the niece and nephews tonight and scored a delicious meal again! Sweeeet!   urlLink    Andy and Lilly
