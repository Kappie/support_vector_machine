We hadn't married yet when the deadline to choose our benefits came up.  I checked with our office HR and she said that I can add my spouse "anytime" because its a change in status.  So I was happy.  Well, office HR was out sick for a week and we didn't receive our marriage license till the beginning of January.  When I went up to her yesterday she told me I only had 30 days after the change of status to change my election and add my spouse....I looked at her with horror--our wedding was on Nov. 22nd of last year!.....Why hadn't she mentioned this before?....then she starts telling me how when she had her baby she didn't know about the 30 day rule and so they wouldn't let her add her son to her benefits....why didn't she tell me this before!?!?!?!?!   Nakakainis ...It's not her fault.  It just goes to show you you have to rely on yourself...I should have called the HR office in Orlando and asked them all these questions or read our benefits guidebook.  Husband is pissed!  On a lighter note I got my Coach purse today.  Still haven't picked it up from the apartment office.  Husband said he will do it.  Husband still loves me despite my gaffe. Yay!  Was very productive last nite...Went to school after work and did some more labs...They're getting a bit difficult especially the ones in quiz forms. I then went home vegetated in front of the TV and watched  Finding Nemo  on DVD.  After that, I.....worked out!  Will notthink too highly of myself for working out this one time because I may fall off the wagon again so to speak, and neglect being physically active.  I also got my referral check from school.  They have a referral program where they give you money for referring people to go the school.  I referred my husband =).  I can do the following with the money:  a)Pay off credit card used for new tires b)Buy a new printer/scanner/copier (all in one) c)Save it  I'm leaning towards b.
