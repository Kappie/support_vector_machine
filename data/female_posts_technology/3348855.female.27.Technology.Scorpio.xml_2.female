    
       I've always been a little unsure Is this my friend for evermore?  People change and drift apart can I really count on this one heart  To spill the beans - no holds barred to show myself - the pretty and the dark  The scars and fears, and still be cherished still be told "You can be so much more"  calm and clear, I must remember  to rejoice in simple things - like his voice.
