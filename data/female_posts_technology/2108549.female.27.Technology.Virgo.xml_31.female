I went this morning to get my pins out but.... the doctor said they need to stay in for another month. The bone isn't callusing or calcifying or cal-something the way its supposed to. And removing the pins at this point will lead to having to have a plate put in later. So the pins stay. One surgery and one set of metal things in my hand is enough for such a lil finger. I have a new cast though and I'm not going to be able to work for another month.   I also got a call from the woman I was to start house sitting for next month and her deployment date has been moved to December at the earliest. I'll still get to house sit, just not yet. I spent the evening at Ju's last night and had a little of the emotional meltdown that has been building as of late. We relaxed and I ended up falling asleep while watching  urlLink Gilmore Girls . There is just something about the house that makes me feel all safe and sometimes safe can lead to sleepy when the lights are off and the TV is on.   I'm supposed to go to a meeting tonight in Coloma but I am SO sleepy. I don't know if I'll make it. Gonna have to see how I feel in a few hours. Right now is definitely nap time.
