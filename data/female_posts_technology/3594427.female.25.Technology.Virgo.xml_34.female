I am brimming with ideas for stuff to write but there is just so little time.   I was supposed to have a meeting in Malaysia this Friday, but the prospect decided to move it to Wednesday next week. Flying in on the 8:30 AM flight and leaving on the 6:50 PM flight.  Anyway, maybe tonight since I need to stay in the office late, I will have time to add entries to my journal.
