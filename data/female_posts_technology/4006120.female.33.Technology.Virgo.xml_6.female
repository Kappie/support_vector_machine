I pretty much completed all my tasks and cleared up a few follow-up flags on my Outlook. It feels gooood to get things accomplished.  We saw  urlLink The Manchurian Candidate  earlier tonight. I enjoyed the movie. It was a good thriller, entertaining but can't really say I was wowed. I think Washington Post's review summed it up pretty much "A stylish hoot: entertainingly edgy and ludicrous all at once."  Anyway, here are the pics I got in my mailbox today.   urlLink    The "birthday girl"... my niece, Liv, who just turned 5.   urlLink    Liv, her kuya Grant and their cousins.   urlLink    Since there are 5 more siblings after me, i think having a dozen nieces and nephews sounds just about right. i miss them all sooo much. at least i get to see three of em in my email today. Sansan, Grant and Liv. Big smile for me!   urlLink    Here's a pic of moi and Liv 2 yrs ago. see the diff? she's grown a lot, huh.   urlLink    With mum (left - sitting, moi in the middle), cousin Lalaine (second from right, standing) and friends. [forwarded email pic, thanks Jan!]
