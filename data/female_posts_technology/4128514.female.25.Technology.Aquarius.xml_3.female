When I'm interested in someone...and it's so rare that I am...I pick up the phone and call just to say "hey, you were on my mind". Yet, if I do this, I may get you on the phone maybe 85% of the time.  great, thats cool with me.  HOWEVER, my voicemails seem to go unreturned for a day or two. Hmm, so now I'm thinking "you're not interested after all". Cool, no prob...I can certainly take a hint. I'm not calling you if you aren't interested..I'm interested, not desperate. Now after a week, you call, wondering why you haven't heard from me. Come on, what is that about? Do guys have a different way of showing their interest? I'm mean, I know you don't like talking on the phone...truth be told, I'm not much of a phone person myself. But I do understand that if I don't call, you don't know you crossed my mind. So looking in the reverse...yeah I'm gonna think the same thing. Damn, once again..I just don't get it.
