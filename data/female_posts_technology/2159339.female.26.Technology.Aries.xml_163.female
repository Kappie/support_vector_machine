It smells like decay and charred tar and vile inhumanity. I know this smell because I used to smell this way. It happens when you are condemned to a life of bad skin and you decide to apply medically-prescribed acid to your acne. To get to the good skin you must burn through the bad. Unfortunately this smells like hell and pure evil. And the results aren't even worth the olfactory torture ("What  is  that foul smell? Jesus H., it's  ME !").   What's also grosser than gross is entering the bathroom when someone just laid a bomb. And as you're doing your business you conclude that it's not just #2 you smell, but the peculiar combo of #2 and apricots.
