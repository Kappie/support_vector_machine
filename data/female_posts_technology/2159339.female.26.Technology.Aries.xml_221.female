Cute as a button but in an edgy tough she'll-kick-your-ass way. She's Joan Jett for the younger set. She'll glare and scowl at the audience, then flex her arm to make a muscle and kiss it. "Do you want to hear another hit?" she'll call out. The audience cheers and she continues, "cause we only play hits!"   Reasons Abby and I were glad we stood a ways back:  1. Unexpectedly, Maja dives off the stage into the crowd. It wasn't that packed, mind you. In fact, it was kind of sparse that night. She kind of sunk as an army of weak indie arms hoisted her back onstage.  2. After smoking a cigarette, she flicks it, still lit, into the audience. Ouch!  Reason I've had my fill of The Sounds: their relevance. After seeing them for the third time, I am questioning this. Their new songs sound like their old songs and all the songs are sounding the same to me. The synth guy knows he is extracting a distinctively 80s sound. How will he manipulate it to move The Sounds onward from novelty throwback to something current and fresh? How are they going to step into 2004? They don't have the versatility of the YYYs or the emotional range. They have an equally dynamic lead singer, but I feel they're going to stunt their growth if they don't show some vulnerability. All metal bands always have one slow rocker: Extreme's "More Than Words" and Guns N' Roses' "Don't You Cry" for example. Unless The Sounds grow, they're going to remain entrenched in 2003.   What am I talking about? Don't listen to me. They're one of the highlights of Coachella! I can't wait to see them in the hot sweltering heat! I wanna hear that synth blast through the desert air!
