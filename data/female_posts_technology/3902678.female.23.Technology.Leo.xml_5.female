On Saturday I went shopping and got new clothes and shoes and purple hair dye, but I forgot to go to To The Point and look into getting my eyebrow pierced like I've been meaning to. GRRRR. Sat around last night and went to sleep early, feeling a little grumpy with my friend situation at the moment. My best friend moved to Ontario on Friday and that's making me feel kind of sad and another friend is kind of frustrating me but ANYWAYS enough about that... whine, whine, bitch bitch... who needs friends anyways? I have a cat and a dog. :) Today Al (my husband) and I went to the antique shops and boutiques in Ft Langely and then to a farewell BBQ for a friend of his who has been a youth pastor at our old church for almost 10 years and is just leaving to pursue other opportunities. It was kind of cool, got to see some old church friends whom we haven't seen since we moved, and that was nice, we have been "kind of" going to church since we moved but haven't really connected with anyone. In a way it was scary though, they are all married and look the same with the same clothes and hair and strings of matching kids named McKenzie and Dakota and Madison..... yikes! That is frightening to me, I never want to be like that...On the way home we got to talking about how maybe when we got married a year ago it was a little too soon for me and I am really starting to realize that now, wishing I'd had a few more years to do what I want and have my freedom without being obligated to someone.. not that my husband isn't a wonderful guy (he's awesome and my best friend) but I think I just wasn't ready for the responsibility yet. Now I feel bad because he is being so patient with me and says he's going to sit back and wait for me to get myself sorted out and figure out what I want to do, and I don't KNOW what I should do. I'm not "unhappy" we do have fun together and we never fight, I just think we should have done some stuff differently or maybe make some changes before it's too late. We are quite different people, that could be it too. Maybe I should be with someone more like me? I don't know. Anyways, I don't even really know what I'm using Blogger for but if anyone out there wants to chat, I am outgoing, cheerful, friendly and always like meeting new people, feel free to get in touch! Hope your weekends were fantastic.....
