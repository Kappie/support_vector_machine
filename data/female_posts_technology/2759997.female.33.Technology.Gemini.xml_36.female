So you can easily read it in order without having to go to the end of the message, read down to the bottom, scan up to the next reply, read down until you get to the start of the first item...  you get the idea.  ...and it allows you to collapse to view just the new part of any message in the conversation or expand it...  ...and, it automatically opens up the print dialogue box after opening the printer-friendly page...  ...and it's so easy to label messages so you can sort them by custom metadata properties rather than by throwing them in a directory...  ...and I'll contain the rest of my excitement until I take a week or two to evaluate.
