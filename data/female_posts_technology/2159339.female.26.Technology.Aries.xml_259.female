Store after store overflowing with bright knock-off purses. Congested sidewalks with pushy hurried women scrambling for cheap goods. Green Marble and I both commented on how much boobie action one gets walking down Canal. I counted at least 3 soft boobs that were pressed into me. There are street vendors packing the sidewalks with fanciful scarves and imitation Tiffany jewelry and grommetted belts. I bought a white belt there for $3! There are rows of Chinese women, purses hung from wrist to shoulder, shouting "PUHSS! PUHSS!" as you walk by. We pushed through the crowd and made our way to Chinatown and Little Italy.   Chinese bakery . XX once said that the Chinese food you get in NYC is different than the stuff that's available in SF. I was like, "Oh yeah, honky? Like what?" And he said, "They make these green onion pancakes there" and to this I laughed long and hard because he's such a food fool. But at the bakery there, they had tuna buns! I've been to a lot of bakeries and never in my 26 years have I seen Tuna Bun! It's exactly like a baked pork bun, but with soft tuna inside!   We went to  Dean  Deluca  the famed delicatessen and tried their cheese samples and bread samples. We bought cheddar and spinach muffins that were so delicious and dense, it was like a meal in a muffin.   We also went to H and some  local tourist shops . GM bought a pink T-shirt with a mexican-style drawing on it of Mary which read, "Mary is my homegirl." I bought XX the Jesus one that said, "Jesus is my homeboy."   I had a  hotdog  there for $1.25 and NYC hot dogs are the bomb-diggity-dog because not only for a dollar and a quarter do you get ketchup and mustard, you also get free sauerkraut, and a delectable drippy orange onion sauce they plop on top.  We walked through a  streetfair  that smelled so good. Everyone was selling whole roasted corn on the cob, grilled chicken kebabs, and this round sandwich everyone was eating (I forget the name) that's like two layers of crepes filled with melted mozzarella.  On Saturday night, we went to a Tapas restaurant,  El Cid , which was a pleasant experience. We (Green Marble, her friend we were staying with, Sara, and myself) sat at the bar and shared a pitcher of white wine sangria. We ordered 4 tapa plates: sweetmeats, a baked quiche-like egg omelette, sausage in wine sauce, and tiny croquettes. At meal's end our waiter gave us each a small glass of Muscat! Their muscat was so smooth, and sweet, and clean, not at all like the $5 Sutter Home muscat I usually buy.  Afterwards we went to a bar/club " The Park " which was a bar with an outdoor restaurant and an upstairs open-air club that included a hot tub. I felt frumpy because I didn't bring any "club-type clothes" but I had fun anyway with Sara and her crew. The men at that NYC club dressed really sharply in fitted ironed shirts with queer-eye type pastel stripes. They wore flattering jeans that were hemmed to hit just right over their Italian shoes. The girls all wore cute fitted halter tops or tank tops with tight bootleg jeans and strappy high heels or a top with a short ruffly tiered mini. I marvelled at how cute everyone looked but I knew this type of fashion-forwardedness would be impossible in SF because it's too cold to take off our coats!  On Sunday we brunched at  The Popover Cafe  and each had a popover which is like a brioche but big, airy, and crisp. They were served with strawberry butter which, when melted, tasted like Yoplait yogurt--creamy and not too sweet. Everyone else had eggs, but I got a chef salad because here is one of the tenets of my new diet: eat more salads. Who the hell savors lettuce? I salivate over chorizo and roasted pork and fried chicken, not lettuce and arugula. When you eat salads, you eat it because it's good for you, not cuz it tastes good. So when you're full, you stop eating because it's not particularly tasty and the smell doesn't intoxicate you into wanting more. Salads have no smell actually. No one ever come homes and exclaims, "MMMM... that salad smells so good!"  After brunch we split up. Sara and GM went to see the Yankees vs The Mets game, and I headed downtown to check out some   architecture . I walked from 59th down to 23rd and admired The Lipstick Building, The Chrysler Building, The Empire State, and the Flatiron Building. Along 5th Ave too, was the  NYC pride parade  so every once in a while I'd watch that and cheer people on. It was really crowded and everyone was in high spirits. I made my way along Stonewall, the historic street where the Stonewall riots occurred in 1969 and clapped for the senior citizens in the parade who were seated and waving their canes. Walking around NYC by myself along the parade route, with the sun warming my shoulders with all my amenities on my back, I felt really content and happy. For the first time ever I genuinely felt happy to be alive. I think, finally, I can forgive my parents for selfishly bringing me into this wretched world because sometimes, it's not so bad, and sometimes, it's kind of beautiful.
