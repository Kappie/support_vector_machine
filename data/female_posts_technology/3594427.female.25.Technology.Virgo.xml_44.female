I really didn't know what to do at that point whether to throw it to the wall, cry or walk out of the client's office and jump off  from the top of the building. I guess you can all visualize what it would have felt like for me. We tried various things to make it restart, but nothing worked. We even called various people from the Singapore office to get suggestions. Well, no one could help us. In the end, I asked the prospect if we could borrow his PC and access the system online via Microsoft Live Meeting. The connection was really slow, but we just tried to make the best out of the situstion. In the end I survived and that's a good thing.    Life is full of so many unexpected twists. Of all the things that could happen to me at a client site the worst thing really is my laptop crashing. My laptop could also be just a reflection of my own condition right now. Physically and emotionally, I just crashed. However, just as in life, you fall, you get up and you move on.      I really don't know what's going to happen to it now. I'm already on my way out and there is no point in my getting a new one. Currently I am using one of the spare units in the office. I will miss it because I have brought it with me to different places and it has a lot of important files for me. Anyway, when I get back to Manila, I'll probably inherit my sister's other laptop. I'm trying to see it as proof that when you lose something, it means that there's another thing better out there for you.
