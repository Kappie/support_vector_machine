So tomorrow is Warped Tour and I am soooo excited...no sleep for me tonight...gawd we are leaving at 6:30am tomorrow morning so that we can get there in decent time.  I am sooo excited about seeing the Bouncing Souls and Lars and the Bastards...oh yeah and The F-Ups ( I hope they have a CD there)  So the verdict has come in...I am now offically NOT going to Boston...gawd doesn't that suck!!!  I guess we can't afford it or something like that...ah well such is life...actually such is my life...BUT there is a show in NY in October that is AWESOME and we are saving up money to go to that.  So for all that are interested (and actually read my site), the show is...The Explosion, Tiger Army and SOCIAL DISTORTION!!!!  How awesome is that lineup!  So yeah Monday is RAW at the JLC...so awesome!!!!  I think this weekend is going to be so much fun and I hope that next weekend is fun as well.
