For the last three years we've picked our favorite charitable organizations, and asked you to tell us which ones are the most important to you by taking a few seconds to vote in our instant poll. This year nothing is as important as the upcoming election, so all the charities in our poll are ones involved in voter registration, education and mobilization for the 2004 elections. This year the poll will only be open for four weeks so we can send our donation in time to make a difference in the upcoming elections so if you're planning to vote please do it right away! You can vote for your favorite charity once each day until September 6th. On that day, we will take the top three (3) charities, divide $50,000 proportionally, and send a check to each organization on behalf of Epitaph and you. Thatâ€™s all there is to it. Thanks for helping us make a difference! Have your say  urlLink HERE !  Via  urlLink Epitaph
