Snack - raspberry yogurt smoothey Exercise - nothing, nada, zip, zero, zilch  Alright, so my plan of going out to batting practice or throwing the ball around every night has been seriously curtailed by the fact that Rick's been umpiring 2-3 nights a week, but then I'm not exactly motivating myself to get going with something else, either. Fortunately, I've been very good with what I'm eating, so at least I'm not ADDING to the size of my posterior. :P
