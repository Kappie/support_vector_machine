Woohoo the dreams and happiness of every Doctor Who fans around the world have finally been realized.  There will be a new season of Doctor Who with Christopher Eccleston playing the Doctor.  Again I can't claim I am familiar with his work but truthfully I don't care.  As long as he can pull off the role of the Doctor I am contented.  With a long line of characters William Hartnell, Patrick Troughton, Jon Pertwee, Tom Baker, Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy, and Paul McGann, Eccleston will make the 9th Doctor.  I can't wait to see his acting styles and his way of presenting the doctor.    I do have to admit that my favorite doctor is not Tom Baker but Sylvester McCoy.  The reason I can give for this is that when I started to watch the Doctor I had started with Sylvester McCoy.  I got used to his style before watching the other seasons with the other Doctors.  I do like Tom Baker though but he is second to McCoy.
