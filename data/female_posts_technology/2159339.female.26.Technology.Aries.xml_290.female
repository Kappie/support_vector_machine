Then brought that over to XX's house for his backyard BBQ. I saw his ex-gf for the first time in person. He was with her for five years then she dumped him. I mostly avoided her because I didn't have anything to say and if I did say something, it would sound forced. Despite this one neurosis, I had a good time. I ate a cheeseburger and a grilled shrimp kebab and a polish sausage and lots of mac n cheese. When XX brought my dish over to the table he said that everyone cheered. Though I mostly hung back and tried to be invisible, his friends engaged me in conversations and made lots of jokes at XX's expense. This made me feel right at home.   After everyone left, XX showed me his collection of swizzle sticks and bar accoutrements and demonstrated how to play a nose flute. I tried, but it sounded feeble. I blamed it on his cavernous Caucasian nostrils versus my small pea-sized ones. He ignored my self-oppressive statements and said to keep trying. After a while I could manage some thin airy notes but I was starting to feel light-headed. I made him give the nose flute to me and I'm currently working on expanding my repertoire from three notes to five.  I'm also back to boinking, but with rubbers this time around. My friend, Mr.Hottie, is training to be a counselor for people with HIV/AIDS and the stuff he tells me is harrowing. I already have to deal with my fair share of physical afflictions and disappointments, so I do not want to add HIV/AIDS to my depressive hodgepodge. I would like to live a long time and die of old age. I would like to live a long time and die of old age surrounded by my coterie of gay male worshippers.
