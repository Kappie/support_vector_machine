Aah the sweet succulent smell of grilling Costco patties whileimprisoned inan officeis the ultimate olfactory reward for a job well done. The execs donned aprons and grilled burgers, dogs, and bbq chicken breasts on the patio while tremendous amounts of smoke billowed onto everyone and their pasty programmer complexions. There were trays of potato salad, regular salad, and beans. The condiments lacked bbq sauce but compensated with a strong showing of sauerkraut. There was also a respectable variety of cookies and desserts.    In other fashion news, today is Nordstrom's Anniversary Sale and another day of Macy's Pre-Season Sale.  urlLink Urban Outfitters  has also come out with their new fall catalog. In honor of these events I'll be staying home, cleaning out my closet. Not to make room for more clothes but to create a fully functional, streamlined PULSATINGGROTTO worthy of worship. Everything I reach for will be relevant and alive. A fashionista can also be an ascetic, eliminating mistakes from fashion past and turning her closet from hits, misses, and maybes to all hits, all the time. Unfortunately, mistakes from fashion past hauntthe present in the form ofcredit card bills. This is the real reason why I'll be staying home--to keep my dreadful credit card monsters from charging and bankrupting my fashion future.
