The following code shows the syntax for generating a DataSet using this tool. xsd.exe /d /l:CS XSDSchemaFileName.xsd /n:XSDSchema.Namespace In this syntax, the /d directive tells the tool to generate a DataSet, and the /l: tells the tool what language to use (for example, C# or Visual Basic .NET). The optional /n: directive tells the tool to also generate a namespace for the DataSet called XSDSchema.Namespace. The output of the command is XSDSchemaFileName.cs, which can be compiled and used in an ADO.NET application. The generated code can be compiled as a library or a module.
