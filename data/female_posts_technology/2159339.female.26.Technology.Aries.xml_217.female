He liked the post but said I gave Masmelow a lot more credit than they deserved. "They were awful!" he said. "If I played like that, I'd be embarrassed to go on stage!" I said that's true because he's a guy. I then went on a long diatribe about why it's important for girls to play rock music which I'll go into details about here. Warning: this will be boring and warning: he totally tuned me out.  It's an important act in itself for girls to even pick up rock instruments and play them, because rock is a male-dominated territory. It's a quiet revolution when a girl does it, because there's a dearth of female rockers. Until Courtney Love, there were no female role models who encouraged girls to pick up guitars and claim ownership of rock instruments. Rock may be less than 100 years old, but the icons are all men. There's Elvis, The Beatles, U2, and an infinite list of others, but who are their female equivalents? Who's sold this many records? What female plays guitar and swivels their hips and charms the world? Madonna is pop. Wanda Jackson is barely known outside of rockabilly and music geek circles. We're not talking jazz vocals or MTV pop or electroclash (genres with a formidable female presence), we're talking about rock n' roll.  It's subversive for the two Masmelow girls to pick up an electric guitar and tap on the drums because they don't approach making music with the typical male bombast of swagger, virtuosity, and technicality. They play with simplicity and reserve. It's almost annoying because they're timid, even, but all the more reason for applause. Why? Because it's a bold effort for women to enter the arena, let alone two shy Japanese girls. XX said, "People only liked them because they were Japanese girls; if I was up there, they'd laugh their asses off." This is completely true. It's because the rock playing field is all dudes. Dudes have to work harder to make themselves stand out from the sea of other dudes. Dudes get guitars for Christmas and have dude rock icons to look up to. Dudes get the adulation and the supermodels. Ladies experience resistance from the beginning, whether from sexist sound guys or overly-critical press that may question merit vs. sexual promiscuity (ex: this week's article on The Peels in SF Weekly). There are so few ladies, that the few that play deserve respect, regardless of their ability. And "ability" is subjective anyway. The traditional term of ability could mean mastery of an instrument, knowledge of all chords, and speed. That belongs to the male realm of technicality. But how about the ability to write a good song? The playing field is levelled with a new definition, but the gender ratio remains inequal.  One can argue that there ARE female Japanese rock bands out there, and Masmelow deserve no credit. But are there? Let's name some: The Boredoms, Cibo Matto, Blonde Redhead, SSKHKH, Shonen Knife, Deerhoof. That's six I can name. SIX out of one gadzillion bands. And they all have cult followings, with no widespread success. I have nothing against all the dudes, but when I see a band of two Japanese girls making rock music (a profession/ hobby comprised of mainly white men) I will applaud and cheer them on. My post focused on the positive, which is that they have potential. The mere fact that these physically and culturally conspicuous ladies are taking the stage conveys a spark inside them. A spark that will broaden definitions and make footnotes, if not pages, in rock history. A spark that could turn into a flame into a fire that just may fuck shit up.*   They're playing music on their own terms. And though they sound simplistic and rough now, I will clap to encourage them to go home and write more songs and practice and continue playing shows. I'll clap for young sloppy girl bands until female rockers are no longer rare but common. And by common, I mean equal in population. For all the shows I go to and all the opening acts I endure, I'll make an educated guess that for every 12 rock guys, there is 1 rock girl. And that's pathetic. So I'm going to clap until my hands fall off for the 11 girls who have yet to take the stage.  (*fucking shit up can also be done in a polite non-aggro way)
