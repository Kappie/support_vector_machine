I will be sharing these posts with you on the upcoming posts.  I hope that you will enjoy and share the excitement that I felt as I embarked upon this new journey! :))      Truly I tell you, whoever says to this mountain, Be lifted up and throughn into the sea! and does not doubt at all in this heart but believes that what he says will take place, it wil be done for him.  For this reason I am telling you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe (trust and be confident) that it is granted to you, and you will [get it].  -- Luke 11:24  A global society grows from common human experiences?  Hmmm... are we a global society about to embark upon some common human experiences?  This verse seems quite profound in light of the trip ahead  my cousin in the hospital.  Any doubts that I may have should be immediately anilated and a greater emphasis to be put upon the words:  GOD CAN!
