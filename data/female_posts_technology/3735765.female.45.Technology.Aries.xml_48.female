Duties will include administrative needs for the Operations area where I'll be able to utilize my statistical and analytical background.  In supporting myself and two others, I am hoping that it will also include a significant pay increase; however, I am going to be thankful for any level of pay increase at this time.  Times have been tough during the past few years where the economy has seemed to have slumped to an all-time low.  I have applied for several positions at my place of employment.  If it isn't meant to be for me to have this particular position, I truly hope that this will be the first of many interviews to come and that I will find the perfect niche soon!! :)  Say your prayers for me today...
