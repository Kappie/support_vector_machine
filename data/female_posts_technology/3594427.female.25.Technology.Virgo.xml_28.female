I know there are some conservative Catholics who disapprove of people going to fortune-tellers, astrologers and psychics. To me though, I see nothing wrong with that. A good fortune teller will help clarify for you possible consequences your decisions may have. They could warn you of any dangers that may come your way. However, a true fortune teller, psychic or astrologer will always acknowledege that everything boils down to the choices we make and that we always have the power to change our destiny. So in a way, my readings are a form of therapy for me and not really a way of finding out what will happen in the future.  Anyway, I asked her about certain decisions in my life that I have made recently and she says I am on the right track. I think I don't need a fortune teller to tell me that. As it has always been in my life, once I have set my heart on something, nothing ever stops me from achieving that goal. I also wanted to ask her about certain people in the office and the big question, "Who can I trust?". I got some pretty interesting replies.  Anyway, it's the start of my favorite time of the week....the weekend!!!! Leaving the office now to watch a movie with one of my friends. Done with all my reports so I am free already!
