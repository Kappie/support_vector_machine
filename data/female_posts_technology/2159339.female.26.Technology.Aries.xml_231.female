We met up with LingL and her friend Charo at The Hotel Utah, which is a bar with a small stage. I asked the bartender to make me a drink that involved ginger or ginger ale and she made me a Jack  Ginger, which was ginger ale and Jack Daniels. BartD was sitting two seats down from us at the bar and XX kept threatening to start a conversation with him. It's a threat because I'm adamant about never meeting him or talking to him because what if he's mean? What if he's in a hurry and doesn't have time to talk to me? What if he looks over my shoulder or looks around the room while I'm talking to him? It ruins the fantasy! My fantasy isn't that complicated: I imagine that he's nice, likes to go camping, and sing songs for his friends. Also, that he has asthma and allergies and isn't a whore.  I tried to contain my excitement and girlish glee when I watched him play because I didn't want to look like a big goofy dork, but occasionally I'd look over at XX, who the entire time was grinning from ear-to-ear like an idiot, god lovim. I led XX into the wonderful world of Bart Davenport and now he's equally smitten. It's his 5th show. He even went once without me.   I love BartD. The only drawback of going to see your favorite performer at a sparsely-populated intimate venue is that you can't sing along. You must not, because if you do, everyone will hear you and the performer may even shush you as you will be louder than he is.   The headliner was Red Thread, who we didn't stay for. Charo and LingL said they were great. Next time. If they OPEN for Bart.  This was my 8th BartD show. He should just have some kids so I can send them to college. Next time I'll just skip the formalities and stuff bills directly into his pockets.
