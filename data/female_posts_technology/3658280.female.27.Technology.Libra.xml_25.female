We're taking state routes instead of the Interstate, so it should be interesting.  It will just be nice to get away for a while.   The weather is supposed to be cooler than it's been, but that may be comfortable sitting in the stands.  Last year I roasted.  I kept taking ice from the beer cooler and holding it on my back and chest so it would melt and run down my shirt. (Much to my boyfriend's dismay, I did not have on a white shirt) I'm a puss when it comes to really hot weather.  I never drink enough (well, enough water anyway) and then I get all lightheaded. And hopefully it won't rain tomorrow.  We got rain gear, but I really don't want to have to use it!  I just wish our hotel had a pool.  I would love to go swimming.  Actually, after that much time on the back of a bike, a hot tub would probably be more suitable. I haven't been on a real vacation in so long where I've been able to swim.  I miss it.  I miss the beach, too.  But boyfried says he's taking me to Cancun in March, so I guess I can wait that much longer.  Last year, Rusty Wallace finished 10th at the Brickyard.  He was also doing better in points than he is this year.  I'm kinda taking a liking to that young Kasey Kahne.   Excellent driver for a rookie!  I get a lot of flack for liking the Dodge drivers.  But I've always been a Mopar girl.  Ask my daddy.  So it's great that I get to go with a Gordon and Earnhardt Jr. fan.  Actually, it's no big deal, but they do like to tease me.  Anyway, I don't care. I'm going away for a few days and won't have to think about work or the housework or anything.  I can use the break.  Bring on the Miller Lite!
