My husband got no email or memo, and there was no meeting to announce it. My husband learned this because his window from his cube at the Saint Paul Travelers overlooks the news ticker dat-board at the Minnesota Public Radio building nearby in downtown Saint Paul!  Saturday July 24, we took our kids to the Minnesota Zoo. The St Paul Travelers Company had an employee discount day, and we purchased tickets for it several weeks ago. We watched an IMAX film about coral reefs, went through an exibit about animals from Madigascar, including Lemurs, We rode on a hay-truck being pulled by a John Deere tractor to a farm yard and the kids enjoyed the petting zoo. I couldn't drag my 5 year old son out of the petting zoo pen! He was petting a goat, and protesting, "But he likes me! He likes me!" We had lunch under a canopy, part of the company plan, but the Saint Paul Travelers is such a big company, my husband didn't recognize anyone there! We came back exhausted and dehydrated, just in time for my daughter to go to her friend's slumber party.  Sunday, yesterday, we drove off at about 9 am to join our friends at their camp-ground. Many of them were old college class-mates of ours, but really were my husband's friends more than they were mine. He's currently in a stock-investment club with most of them, but their whole purpose for this camp-out was to play role-playing games. Not Dungeons and Dragons specifically, but other games like it. One of them had made super-hero capes for all the children, and when my daughter asked if she had any purple ones...yes she did! We were all so impressed, as my daughter has been looking for a purple cape for weeks, to complete her costume of her hero Raven , the Teen Titan! The adults played volley ball. The children played with squirt guns, and I took numerous trips with them to to the nearby old-fashioned water pump from the ground, pumping the lever so they could fill all their squirt guns some more. I've secretly banished all toy guns from our house. I don't buy them and luckily no one has ever given them to my kids as a gift. So this was a total novelty to both my kids and they loved it! Again, that afternoon we returned home more dehydrated than before, I fell asleep on the couch that afternoon. Made hot dogs for dinner, fell asleep on the couch after both my kids' baths, and still slept through the night, and didn't want to get up this morning!
