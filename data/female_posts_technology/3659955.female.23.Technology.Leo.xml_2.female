I cannot believe how much information is swimming through my head... I'm so glad it's the weekend, though other than Father's Day and grocery shopping, I really have no plans. I need to get a life, I'm turning in to a boring married person! Help me! My best friend Melissa is home from Calgary soon, so then things will pick up a little, but still. I don't really know anyone here in Chilliwack. I need to make some friends and not sit around the house as much. I feel like everyone in the world has a really great social life except for me....
