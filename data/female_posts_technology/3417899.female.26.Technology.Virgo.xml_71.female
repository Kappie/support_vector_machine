Time ended:  3:00 PM CDT   The results :     Good deed: Crying kid lost his parents. Nobody cares. I hold his hand, take him to the information booth, page the parents. Hysterical mother approcahes after 40 (!) minutes. I get yelled at (!).  I keep calm.     Bad deed: I sneak into the Admirals club. I am not a member. I am not allowed. But here I am - free food, free drink, free internet.
