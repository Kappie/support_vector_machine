It was worth my time because the kissing scenes were so... terrible. I was amused by the way they made me uncomfortable and squirmy. The kissing was awkward and passionless. There were no squeaky suction-y kissing noises. No sweet puckering of luscious lippies. The first kiss was a chaste press of the lips between the guy and the gal. It was like they were co-worker and co-worker, priest and nun, or... my mom and my dad. Boring! I can see that shit for free at home.  Then there is a kiss at the end with the gal kissing Andrew McCarthy. I laughed because I was embarrassed. As she closes her eyes and goes in for the liplock, Andrew McCarthy coyly pulls away before he indulges his passion. That is so GAY!!! Andrew McCarthy, you are so gay!!! Why the hesitation? She is clearly better-looking, better-dressed, and a better kisser than you! I don't understand! That is such a metrosexual move! I am exacerbated by the fact that he was trying to be all sexy, but he has a weak chin and that unblinking googly stare! He is no matinee idol, but a pasty nerdling with an overbite. Andrew, know thy station!! He pulled away, as if he had other options and was reconsidering. That is unbelievable and so, so, gut-stabbingly, gas-inducingly gay. So I laughed, but really, I wanted to cry it was so gay.
