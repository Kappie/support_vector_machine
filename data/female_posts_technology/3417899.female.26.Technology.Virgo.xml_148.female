It was the first funeral I had attended of a friend, someone around my age (later in life, I would attend a dozen more...). That funeral remained etched in my memory. The soldiers crying, the shock, the parents. The poem Y's sister read when he was buried.  Y was part of a close-knit gang of guys, who did everything together: "Y"," I", "N", and "E". I had dated "N" for almost a year, and had some on/off romance with "I". They were all devastated, but "I" - who was Y's best friend, was shattered. He committed suicide a couple of months later, and that was the second funeral I had attended. That funeral was more difficult, more painful and more terrible. Because it may have been prevented, because I had a crush on him, because we had kissed only a few months earlier.   After that things changed, people drifted apart, some started using drugs. "N" left the army and had a nervous breakdown. I grew up, grew away, grew different.   Years had gone by, and although not forgotten, these memories were pushed back into the dusty - hardly used - drawers of my brain. Hardly ever resurfacing. Until today.  I saw "I'"s face in that of a teenager on the street. The same smile, the same freckles. I stopped in my tracks. That's how "I" looked before he died. (I couldn't age him in my mind).  I tried to look them both up on the internet ("Y" and "I"). Surely they have been commemorated somehow. "I" does not appear anywhere (anywhere that is googable, anyways). "Y" is only briefly mentioned in the caption of a photo included in the article. A photo from that first funeral. "N" is wearing the red beret. I was standing right next to them.  They are not on the Internet. They are gone.    urlLink    An Israeli soldier weeps during the funeral of Sgt. ----- in 1995.
