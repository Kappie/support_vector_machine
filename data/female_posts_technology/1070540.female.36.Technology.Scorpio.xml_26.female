I was trying to make a great dinner and it turned out to be the worst ever.  Then he told me how I should keep our house clean but I dont.  It is my responsiblity, but I cant seem to get it done.  I have been trying hard to play catch up.  Tonight I am staying up to finish the laundry. But today out of no where.  My mother n law came over, returned her computer?!  (still not sure why) and then told me that she would be coming over to help me clean house and iron everyweek,  That really made me feel inadequate.  Plus the oldest 3 really acted up today.  But I truely think that is because they had to go home to their dads and did not want to. But it made Ken feel like they were picking on Brian.  So see...I am not a good wife, and not a good mother.  Cause if I was either,  none of this would of happened.  It seems the harder I try, the worse I get.  DAMN IT!!  I really hate me.
