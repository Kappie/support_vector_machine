"Okay," they think to themselves, "Here is a brand new person who smiles at me."  Followed by them yaking the slimy white mucus all down your arm, shirt, onto your shoes (hopefully you are wearing some), all over your shoulder, etc.  " There !", they think, "This new person is marked as  mine .  Henceforth, they shall clean my dupa, feed me and otherwise scramble to find out why I'm crying."  Then, they look up at you sweetly and smile toothlessly, and you say, " Awww  - how cute!".    Yes, another baby spit up down my arm.  And then, she grinned at me.  (sigh) - What are you gonna do?   Let's talk about airplane flights.  I booked a flight today - and paid a  good 150.00$ more than I would have paid 10 days ago.  What is up with this bilking of the world citizens.  Shouldn't airfare either stay the same or even go down close to the flight.  I would think that if there are open seats closer to the flight date, they would want to reduce the price to book people on the planes.    With the current system, people are forced to plan their trips well in advance.  If airfare were cheaper, I think there would be more spontaneous traveling.  I spontaneously go to Memphis.  Why wouldn't I spontaneously go to NYC if airfare weren't so damn cost prohibitive?  So, Commercial flyers are a bunch of Punks!   Okay - that's my opinion on that -  Let's move on the new guy on the horizon - Kyle.  Kyle is a sweetie.  Smart, sweet, polite and by all accounts a cutie too.  We talked on the phone for about an hour.  And, we didn't run out of topics.  He did tickle me - he asked me if I knew what OPEC is.  To test my intelligence.  I said, "What? The Gas people?".  Which is still not the best answer.  The correct answer, which came to me about 20 minutes after we got off the phone is Oil  Petroleum Energy Commission.  But, hey - he was just checking to make sure I knew it had something to do with fuel. :)  Which was very cute.  In my opinion anyway.    It's not a bad little question to root out the dumb girls.  And any man worth his salt doesn't want to date a dumb girl.  Well, I take that back - lots of decent men want to date dumb girls - but only because they are insecure.  And I wouldn't want an insecure man anyway.  Confidence is a desirable quality. (wink).  Even average guys become hotties if they are smart and confident.  Aloha! cutesox
