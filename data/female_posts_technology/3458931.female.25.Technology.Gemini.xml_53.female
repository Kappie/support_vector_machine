From the CBC website: "From the team that produced Newsworld’s “The Docket”, Sweet Justice is a weekly radio program probing the legal issues that make you roll your eyes as you read your morning paper, raise your voice in a heated dinner-party debate, or wonder whether Dick the Butcher had a point when he declared it was time to “kill all the lawyers”."  Tonights' show focuses on the democratic right to protest, and how to do so without violating any laws and landing in the slammer (or even worse, pelleted with rubber bullets and eyes doused in pepper-spray).
