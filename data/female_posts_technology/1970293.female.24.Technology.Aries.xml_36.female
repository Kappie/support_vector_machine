Still yelling, he savagely kicked her over and over.  She curled up into a ball in such shock that this could be happening to her.  She never knew this side of him until now.  Their marriage so new and yet so horrible.  If only she could get up, she could maybe stop him by fighting back.  He stopped for a few seconds, long enough for her to stand.  He slammed her back to the floor to kick her again and again.  The tears would not come but the fear strangled her.  She didn't understand how this could happen to her.  How she could choose a man who would be abusive to her.  She could never trust him again for fear of raising his anger towards her.  Her innocence broken forever that someone could hurt her in this manner.  She always thought she would be safe and protected in this world.  She was wrong.  Finally he stopped.  She stood up slowly to make sure he wouldn't just knock her down once more.  He was quiet.  She sidled past him and rushed to the bathroom.  She just wanted to hide in a small hole forever.  Not only was this hurtful, it was also shameful and embarrassing to be a victim of physical violence.  She realized that she couldn't talk to anyone about this for they would get angry in her defense and wonder why she wouldn't leave him.  But she loved him though the reasons are getting thin.  She didn't think he realized how much she loved him and yet how he was killing her slowly.  She prayed to whomever was listening to help her but she knew no one would.  She also knew it would happen again one day.  Will she be strong enough?  All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003
