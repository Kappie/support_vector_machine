We set up the little charcoal grill that I bought almost a year ago, and he showed me his Secret Technique For Grilling Chicken:   Step 1:  Stack coals in pyramid and light with match in several spots   Step 2:  After the flames have died out, spread the coals evenly across the bottom of the barbecue grill   Step 3:  Place the chicken on the grill, and shut the lid   Step 4:  Have a beer while you're waiting for the chicken to cook   Step 5:  Check the chicken, and see that it's not done yet   Step 6:  Have another beer while you're waiting for the chicken to cook   (etc.)   The chicken never actually gets cooked all the way, but eventually you're drunk enough that you eat it anyway.
