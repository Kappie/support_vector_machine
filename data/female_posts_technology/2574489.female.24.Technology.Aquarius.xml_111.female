Actually, make that till 11:00 because the stupid building people decided to wax the floors at about the time we were leaving and wouldn't let us pass through lest we leave footprints.  Grrrr....  I got home tired, hungry, cranky...until I saw what hubby had prepared.  He had been home hours before but had waited to eat with me. In the meantime, while he waited, he had prepared rigatoni pasta in olive oil and garlic, with slices of golden bell peppers, caramelized onions and baby carrots.  The main entree was mouth-watering chicken marsala with mushrooms.  It all went down nicely with a glass of Beringer White Zindfandel rose wine.  A nice way to end the day.   I would have taken pics but we devoured the food within minutes.
