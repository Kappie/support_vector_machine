I wonder if I should get an award for that.  There will be plenty more of it next week when I have my wisdom tooth surgery.  I had been pretty tired all day, but I thought my little nap wouldn't last but a few hours.   If you've ever seen Seabiscuit, Wayne says I'm like that horse.  There's a scene where they first show him, sleeping in a pasture.  The trainer talks about how all he does is sleep and eat, but he ends up being really fast out on the track.  I think Wayne's just being nice about the last part though; he's a much faster cyclist than me.
