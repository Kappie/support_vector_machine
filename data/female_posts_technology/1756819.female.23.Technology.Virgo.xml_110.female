Unfortunately everyone else had also decided that it was a great beach day.  All you could see was a sea of bodies, and there was no parking to be found.  So, plan B.  We changed our minds and went to a local park, much fewer people, a less crowded beach, and best of all, available parking!  So we settled down on the sand with our towels, sunscreen and reading material to enjoy the afternoon sun.  Watched a mother bury her son in the sand, kids building sandcastles, couples walking hand in hand along the shore, and one family digging a big hole to bury their father in.  Upon returning home, we picked up some noodle soup after a bit of grocery shopping, and headed home to watch Minority Report.  What a life :)   urlLink    Samara and I at the beach.
