We're staying at  urlLink Heritage House ...nice!  And...we finally booked our Hawaii vacation, yipeee! After months of surfin' online for some cheap vacation packages...and debating if we want Cancun, Puerto Vallarta or Kauai...we finally found a really good deal...yeah baybee...$800 with air + hotel + car...sweeeet! YES, we are off to  urlLink Kauai Island  in 7 weeks! for 8 days and 7 nights in  urlLink Plantation Hale ... I'm sooo excited and I just can't hide it...   Friday is always a good day!
