Neil Patrick Harris played no part in it, other than discussions of his outstanding performance in Assassins.  We ordered a six pack and a cheese fries.  Lexi's analysis of the burgers as the American Chasiubao is fairly accurate.  Each burger is mainly soft sweet bun wrapped around a slice of meat so small that it is difficult to judge its quality.  The grilled onions and burger grease create a kind of a sauce.  They come with a choice of regular cheese, jalapeno cheese, or bacon and cheese (there's almost more bacon than burger meat).  There are also chicken and fish counterparts.  I like the chicken cheese best of all the options, even though the strip of chicken was mostly breading.  The fries were hot and fresh though.  It was slightly disappointing to find out that cheese fries means fries with a tiny tub of colored, flavored oil similar to 7-11 nacho cheese.  Our White Castle experience did not go off without any setbacks, as they were out of not only ketchup but water as well (I wouldn't have cared before, but now that I'm avoiding caffeine, I can't just drink gallons of diet coke as I used to so I have to revert back to the basic staple of life H20 for liquid refreshment).  It was an interesting experience, but I would suggest to all those Californians that may be craving this East Coast "Delicacy" that they buy the freezer packs and microwave away.  I doubt the experience will lose any of its savor.  Or better yet, skip White Castle and go right to the nearest In-N-Out for a truly tasty burger.  (It's a shame we will never see a movie of similar nature based around In-N-Out what with the Bible verses on their bags and fry baskets and all)  Check out the Andrew and Lexi go to White Castle photo montage at:  urlLink  http://www.seq.org/~acasteel/newyorkwhitecastle/index.htm   I've also updated the Subversive Graffiti Pics.  I'm a little scared.  The Young Republicans have spray paint.  And neat little stencils too.  Aren't they so cute being all ribald and painting on the side walk.
