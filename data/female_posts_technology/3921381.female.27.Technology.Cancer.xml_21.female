I'm effective as always but just tired. overworked and underpaid. i got myself an office and new furniture but no promotion yet. maybe that's why i'm so bothered and upset. the promise of a promotion that may not take place anytime soon.   I think i'm going to work on my rubiks cube at work during my downtime. got to get a hold of some algorithm and apply it in hopes of getting all the damn colors back on each side. Its do-able. Just have to have patience and i think a brain is needed for the algorithm.  What a goal! i'll be figuring out the cube in my dreams, i'm sure.
