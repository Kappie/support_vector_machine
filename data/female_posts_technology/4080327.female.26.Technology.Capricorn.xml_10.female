When I arrived at work yesterday, I met up 2 of my colleagues and my CEO for breakfast. I was told to take care of the new project which is going to start. Still blur from the morning blues, I just nodded. My colleague told me, someone told the CEO I am bored with my current work. I wondered who. I never talk to anyone about my work ...  unless he saw my blog!   Then later, I was given my first task as an Implementer...and it kept me busy for the whole day  and  night. First time burning mid-night oil since working here.  Sigh.      I wonder what Implementers do. How I am going to handle this new project when I have never been an Implementer. The other two implementers are outstation. I guess I will have to take one thing at a time. Think about it when it comes.
