You know, like you do for background noise...  but as you know, these shows are like train wrecks... you just sort of find yourself watching them and wondering what these poor people did in some former life to be run over by the karma train and end up on Jerry Springer or Ricky Lake.  (as even Jerry Springer mentioned to the audience in one of his shows, "If you're on this show... you know it can't be good.") Today's Ricky was all about "extreme breast makeovers", of course, they took other parts and pieces off the women as well... for the "makeover part" I suppose. All the girls were in their mid 20s, would be my best guess.  Hell, one even had her boyfriend with her at her operation (and exactly why did she feel so insecure about the whole procedure??? was it him???) But they all made it sound like this was the best damn thing that they EVER did... and how much it increased their self esteem and gave them confidence... Some things that disturb me (beyond all the little girls at home watching how easy it is for them to change their body by knife for a new look), well what I just mentioned disturbs me too.  But with all of these makeover programs, is it any wonder why people are so disatisfied with themselves?  Playboy, Men'sIllustrated Swimsuit Edition... advertisements.  Is it any wonder how people can be so irrational if their nose has character, if they are tall, if they are short, if they are curvy.  Whatever happened to what's inside someone?  And women are just as bad, GQ, Mens Health... I know that I sneak a peak between the covers of those mags to see what's smoking once in a while. The truth that we all know... ok, maybe not until you are closer to your late 20s, or just EXTREMELY insensitive, shallow or STUPID ... once we get under that pretty wrapping, we taste something sweet, but soon begins to make us sick to our stomach.  Because the candy coating was all that there was... and if I can elaborate a bit more, sometime there is a stinking pile underneath it... (which can REALLY make you sick!) Ok, ok, I hear you... some simply WANT a taste... nothing else.  (but not most, not all)   Isn't it about time that we start learning to live with who we are, and not the idea of who we someday hope to be?
