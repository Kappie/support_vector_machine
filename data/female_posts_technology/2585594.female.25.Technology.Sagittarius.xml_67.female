What I found was hilarious...It was almost like a filipino comedy series. Hahaha. Here are some snippets (of course, they're my mind's version...but I tried to stick as much as possible to the lines I remember her saying)...  Girl: so what do you do? Guy: I actually own a small internet company Girl: oh really. What is it? Guy: I sell shoes for pets Girl: (short pause…) hmm…so you went through college to sell shoes? Me: Okay, maybe she has a point. In a philosophical kinda way….  Guy: So what do you do? Girl: well, I have a lot of jobs… Guy: Really? Like what? Girl: well, I’m an administrative assistant and a receptionist Me: Oh my, dami nga!  Girl: All I really do is work, shop, and drink. Me: Hmmm. I am so impressed.  Guy: (sun is still up) Are you hungry? Girl: No. I just want to drink. Guy: Don’t you wanna eat first. Girl: No. It’ll leave less space for the drinks. Not eating will make me drunk faster. Me: Wow. Powm-chickey-powm-powm is in the air for this guy (wink wink)  Girl: Let’s drink up (holds up what looks like a pinkish iced margarita) Guy: Uhh..okay.. Girl: I might get ice head. Or what do you call that…freeze brain…freeze…brain…freeze…oh, brain freeze… Guy: I’m not sure it’ll hurt you. Me is gagging from laughter…  Girl: I may be bubbly but I’m smart… Me: Yes, darlin’. We believe you.  AND MY FAVORITE REPARTEE from this couple: Girl: (talking about her hair getting darker as she got older) I’m actually starting to doubt my parents because of my hair color Guy: (chuckles) oh...maybe the milkman was over huh…(chuckles...getting red in the face) Girl: (5-second pause..) Are you making fun of my skin now…? Guy: What? (confused look) Girl: Yeah…milkman…milk…my milky skin…. Me: Huwaaaaaaaatttttttttt!!!!!!!! Mooohahahaha…  And that's all for tonight, ladies and gentlemen. ba-dump-bump-tshh (lights out, curtains down).
