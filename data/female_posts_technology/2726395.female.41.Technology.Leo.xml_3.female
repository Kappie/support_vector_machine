Welcome to my blog, my pyschopathic sister tried to kill herself a week ago tonight, I saved her life and today I am the family's pariah.  Still with me?  All right, if you can take that, you can take anything else I might write.    Somehow I felt I ought to be sharing all this, and what is going on. Maybe it's a cautionary tale, maybe it's interesting, maybe its a comment on what society has become, maybe I'm just whining.  At any rate, welcome to Rosenthorns.  So, let's get back to this sister's attempted suicide thing.  My sister is a psychopath. And I don't mean that in the colloquial sense, the way we used to use the word "terrorist" to describe an energetic two-year-old, but don't anymore.  I mean, she is a severely ill psychopathic woman.  She has caused my entire family nothing but pain for all of her adult life.  She stole from my parents, lied to everyone she ever knew, cost me every old friend I ever had with whom she came into contact, stole my SSN and took my name, ruined my credit, cost me at least two major corporate jobs when I failed the background check, and cost me thousands of dollars in additional fees when I tried to buy a house. She poisoned my dogs.  She has never had a long term relationship with another living soul, but has created some very imaginative boyfriends. Real boyfriends can be identified by their restraining orders against her. This is not a colloquial psychopath, this is a clinical psychopath.  Last Wednesday night, I got a call from someone I never heard of. "Regarding your sister," was all the message said. I almost didn't call. "God," I thought. "she ripped someone else off and is now coming after her family for the money."  But I did call. It was the Right Thing to Do. And Pam always does the Right Thing.  The voice on the other end of the phone told me that my sister has been threatening suicide, and earmarked the next day as the day she would do it.  My other sister had told this person that our sister is a pathological liar and that she should ignore the messages. However, if she felt that she needed to, she should call up our sister Pam, because Pam always Does the Right Thing.  I told this person that there was at least a 60% chance that my sister was lying, but because the next day was our parents' anniversary, I thought it would be best to at least attempt follow through. After two harrowing hours on the phone with a completely inept San Francisco Police Department, they broke into her house and found her chock full of Valium with a plastic bag over her head and two suicide notes.  Apparently nobody in our family can say anything in less than two pages.  She was "detained" and then promptly lost by the SFPD for another two hours, while I tried to track her. The ineptiude of SFPD is epic, but that's another Thorn in My Side.  Anyway, now it's a week later. My parents, who never were particularly good decision makers, have come rushing to her aid with open arms and checkbook. They mortgaged their home and are paying her way through everything while my sister continues to lie to them.  They are supporting her rather extravagant lifestyle while she gets "help," though most psychiatrists agree that psychopaths are beyond the help of their profession.  They have practically canonized her, constantly speaking in glowing terms about how she is going to get job training, how she is going to make good on all her debts, how she is going to get better and has such a bright future.  I raised a point. "Um," I said, "Can you afford to be supporting her to the tune of $2000 a month?  Is there a reason she has to stay alone in her three-bedroom apartment in North Beach with a view of the bay that costs more than my home mortgage?  Do you have any time limit for this open-checkbook policy? Do you have any expectations of her?"  I explained to them there was a difference between helping and enabling, and that they were not doing anybody any good by supporting her lifestyle so that she can go out and lie, cheat and steal some more with no end in sight. I explained that help would entail a plan, with an end-date, a budget based on what they could afford, and a list of expectations.  My parents angrily told me that they would pay for "as long as it takes," informed me that I have no compassion, and told my sister that she should not talk to me because I am "hysterical."  There's another aspect to this little tale.  I have a five year old son.  My husband and I really feel that a five year old really shouldn't be subjected to a psychopath who has already shown she is dangerous to herself and to others, and let's not forget that she poisoned our dogs, not once but twice, with what two sets of vets think was some kind of detergent. My parents insist my sister is of no danger, and that I am being horrible. The words "Child Endangerment" seem to mean nothing to them.  Meanwhile, some of my other friends have been very critical of my actions in preventing her suicide. Here in San Francisco, we are very politically correct, you see, and we are allowed to do with our bodies what we please. I am apparently a fascist because I prevented my sister from doing what she pleased with her body.  Still others have criticized me for saving her because she is so useless, she's caused nothing but pain, she wasn't worth saving, and now I've caused my family more because I had to be a hero.  I am not a hero. I did not save my sister for her sake. I saved my sister so it wouldn't hurt my parents. There's an irony, huh? I am not a willing victim, as someone suggested. I did the Right Thing. I know I did.  But damn it all, it is awfully lonely.
