Reportedly, The band North Side Kings were on the bill and was bumped completely from the show, after they drove 6 hours from thier hometown. This video is a portion of what happened when a NSK member went to find out why they were bumped. Clearly, as you will see, Glenn assaults the guy first, then gets knocked out. I guess it goes to show that if you start a fight you better be ready to deal with it (Warning Violence): http://www.azpunk.com   Via  punkunited.com
