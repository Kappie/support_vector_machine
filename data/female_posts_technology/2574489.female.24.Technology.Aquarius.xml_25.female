I come across so many computer illiterate people and when I was new, I used to be very patient with them, grateful for my job, grateful for working in a gorgeous downtown setting.  Now, I have no patience at all with these people, especially the ones that call and say they are: network admin, admin, technical coordinators:  Here are some nuggets from my work:  Caller: I am an admin! Me: Okay, then try to create a new folder Caller: I can't. It's saying access is denied.   Me: Exactly, buttwipe!  Me: You need to install it to a network drive: Admin: What's that? Me: I need to talk to someone who is familiar with your network if you're not an admin Admin: I am an admin! Me: Then learn the difference between a local and network drive, you buttwipe!  Tech coordinator: Is this a zero or an 'o'? Me: If it has a slash through it is a zero Tech coordinator: I'm typing it as a zero but when I do, it doesn't have a slash through it on the screen Me: (Laughing my butt off while I have them on mute).  You're a buttwipe   I'm sorry for feeling so cynical today.  All my patience has run out.  I can't wait for the freaking weekend!  And of course, I don't actually call these people buttwipe.  Although I would love to.
