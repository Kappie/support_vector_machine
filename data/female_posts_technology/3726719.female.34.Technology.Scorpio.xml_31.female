Got a call in the afternoon - the radiologist report was in.  Hip was fine.  No problems found.  This is good AND bad.  It's good because there isn't anything seriously wrong.   It's bad because I am still in constant pain!!!   It's not AS bad as it was.  I still limp with every step.  Stretching doesn't relieve it.  And I feel broken down.   Sigh.  So now I've got to figure out what to do next.  I'm thinking about scheduling an appointment at the Franklin Bone  Joint clinic.   There's got to be something I can do to get this pain gone and get back to feeling good again.  I'm not getting any answers or suggestions from the chiropractors, so it's time to try another field of medicine.
