Friday night we went down to saint john and went to a free concert on the board walk. It was cold and foggy as usually in Saint John, but the music was good. It was Nathan Wiley who opened for Matt Mays. It was pretty good. Duane and I set at Keystone's with Aimee and Scott and had some drinks.   On Saturday we all went to Moncton for the night. It rained all day Saturday which ruined our plans. We were going to go to parlee beach or magic mountain. Instead we just hung out and went to the driving range (well it didn't rain) and the went to the mall. We had some lunch to, so that took up some time. We all went to the club that night and got totally loaded then Aimee and Scott go into a fight and left at like 12:30 or 1, can't remember. We tried to help them sort it out but decided it was best if they did it on their own. Duane and I went back to the club and had a great time dancing and stuff. I won some free drinks and some $1 off coupons for the club. So it was all cool. Duane and I went on the go carts on Sunday and to costco then we all headed home. Scott wasn't feeling good and was cranky so we didn't do much. I guess they finally got everything sorted out on Sunday after they got home. Aimee emailed me and apologized for Scott being such an ass. Duane and I had fun anyways so it wasn't a big deal.   Well it was back to work tonight, for 4 nights. Fun fun, more test prep to develop.
