I wonder if it ever seems as boring as it actually is to the rest of the world. hmm.   talking to myself again. Its an awful habit I've re-acquainted myself with. Things have been going along swimmingly...Pippo got a job and a working visa. he'll be returning at the end of October for the holidays. Its good to know that he'll be coming back after the scare that he gave us last week. Very suddenly and incredibly breifly he tried to slip out of sight without anyone knowing where in the hell he was going to. We only JUST got the chance to get in a send-off under the wire before he fled the coop. Not very nice of him.  however it is a good sign. It is also an auspicious sign that Ken got a job as well. Over a year and a half of nothing and he got an offer. Its not definite but it is definitely promising. You have to be hopeful otherwise there is no way that you can survive that kind of torment. Besides....EOP works in his favor. Most companies would kill to have an intelegent black man as an employee. (not necessarily loyal mind you - and rightfully so considering the prior hell he went through with his previous employers.)  so things are looking up. I am making a good impression...and if my memory serves me there was mention by my predicessor that she might not return after the birth of her child. I'm hopeful that she will NOT return if only because I like having a paycheck. I like having a job to go to. I like having co-workers again. And although the work is not necessarily saving anyones life...it is satisfying nonetheless.
