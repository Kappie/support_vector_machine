I am thinking about getting a boob job.  I feel I need them lifted and slightly bigger.  I wish I could get other plastic surgery, but god knows I will not be able to afford it. I want to get my eye brow pierced too.  Am I going through some mid-life crisis? I don't know. My family seems to think so. LOL Going to be a very long weekend.
