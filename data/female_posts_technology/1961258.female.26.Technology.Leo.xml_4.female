That's got to be a record .. now it'll take me .. hmm ... 12 - 18 months to get it off. I DO NOT like this weight gain, then weight loss ... then all over again. It's not healthy and it's horrible for the body (plus when you put it back on, it's actually MORE fat than before .. how this works, i don't know). I need to change my behaviour, I need to have a point where I go STOP and re-evaluate my weight when that happens. Like say if I gain 5lbs. I can go, okay .. now I need to lay off the sweets and step up the exercise. And not just let myself gooooooooooooooooooo for like half a year. Bloody irreversible damage to my body!   I need to buck up NOW. I am so not going to be the fat girl anymore. The fat girl DOES NOT get anything. The fat girl IS NEVER happy (truly, completely 100% happy). The fat girl never gets the guy. The fat girl never has an exciting life. The fat girl NEVER wins!   So right now I'm 80kg, 177lbs, 12.5 stones, Size 16 UK. I'm going on a super crash diet tomorrow. No sweets/crisps AT ALL (if you have one, you just have to have more!), NO meals for 1 week (only have protein shakes or bars .. breakfast as usual - cereal or yogurt), no snacking AT ALL (again, do not start even ONE), LOTS of exercise (interval training .. 30 min at least .. every single day; toning .. every single day).   I AM OBESE! I AM SO FAT IT'S UNHEALTHY. NO MORE LIVING IN DENIAL! Almost half of me is composed of fat, how disgusting! I am most definitely a thin person (I have a small frame, NOT a big boned girl like everyone used to say ALL MY LIFE!) .. so I will get thin by July 2004. I'll lose 15kg, 33lbs, 2.5 stones and 2 - 3 dress sizes ... 65kg, 144lbs, 10 stones, Size 10 - 12 UK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 5 kg a month? Okay then ... it's a do or die thing. I cannot live like this for the rest of my life. I do not ever want to be the fat, insecure person anymore. I don't want to be the girl who'll always be ignored by guys. I don't want to be the girl with the pretty face but horrible, fat, ugly body. I don't want to be insecure. I don't want to wear Size 16 clothes.
