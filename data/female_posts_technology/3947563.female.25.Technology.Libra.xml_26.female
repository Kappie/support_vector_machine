Well, all was well, until after dinner. I went to go swimming, and only got to go for half an hour, and for some reason that made me REALLY ANGRY.Like, run over Mother Theresa angry. I came home and started whining and bitching and all of a sudden it hit me..."I WANT COOKIES!!!" but I didn't eat any cookies.   I ate pickled onions, that didn't quelch it. I tried to eat (a small amount of) cheese, that didn't help. I finally calmed the beast by eating a low carb bun that was kicking around for some reason. I think I have some carb issues. I am no longer bitchy, and I no longer want cookies.Still, can't keep that upevery day.  Now I am going to do some pilates to make up for my damn short swim. Grrrrrr.
