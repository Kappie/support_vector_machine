This lead to asking to borrow the dictionary, which then led to the question 'What are you looking up?', which then led to the comment 'Hey, what does 'existentialism' mean?' Which led to the reading out of the definition. Which lead to the discussion 'Am I an existentialist?'   Which lead to the conclusion that you can't be an 'existentialist' and have a job.   The someone said something about the Simpsons and monkeys and the whole existentialist discussion was forgotten.  From the sublime to the ridiculous in the space of half an hour. Don't say to me that philosophy is dead.  Have I mentioned how where I live is now a bit of a craft central?  The most fabulous wool shop called The Yarn Barn has just recently opened up within five minutes walk of my house, and how it has the most beautiful collection of wool and knitting paraphernalia I've ever seen? Clearly, it's a sign that I need to continue with my knitting obsession and that I now need to progress to bigger and better things, such as a jumper or maybe even a beanie.  In addition, another brand new shop called 'Adelaide Beads'  has also just opened up approximately seven minutes walk from my house, selling a wonderful collection of beads and jewellery and trinkets.  Shiny, pretty things all within walking distance!   I'm never leaving home now.   I feel my mother is not as keen on the nearby craft shops as I am.  See 'attitudes to consumerism' in previous entry.
