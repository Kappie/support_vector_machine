I met most of  urlLink Brian's  family on a Caribbean cruise last fall, and quickly adopted his dad (with his mother's blessing) as my "boyfriend".  We found out shortly after the cruise was over that his dad was sick, and now he's gone and I just hope he's better off and not suffering and waiting for us all in a better place.  My parents are another story.  I found out days before the cruise that the divorce was imminent, and was sworn to secrecy to keep it from my siblings at the same time.  So to leave my nightmare and go on a vacation with my friends and newly-found extended family was difficult, to say the least.  But I struggle tonight to accept that, although it's hard to accept he's gone, Brian's family can move on and make the best of things and have an endless stream of happy memories.  My family has just begun the struggle, and memories that may have once seemed "happy" are tainted.  My mother, who has been incredibly strong since this started, has finally lost it and cannot speak to me or my siblings without breaking down.    And I wonder how selfish it is for me (hence the comments for this post being disabled) to think about how better off we'd be if the man I used to call Dad had just died instead of divorcing us...
