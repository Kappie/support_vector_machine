Sarah and No Name were just talking about Cher and her lesbian daughter Chastity's, coming-out book or something. They were not against gay or anything like that however I realized that there are still a lot of people out there that thinks otherwise. I don't really know what's the big deal with being gay or lesbian, man. I don't understand why some people have a strong dislike or irrational hate towards them. I have no problems or issues with them at all. I actually think they are fun and interesting people to hang-out or make friends with.  Growing up in the Philippines, it was quite common to have a gay or lesbian friend or a member of the family. We don't see them as different, they are always part of the community. Filipinos accept them for who they are, or at least that's what I think. We don't go around and beat them or  urlLink drag them at the back of a truck and torture them . Strange one might say especially in a country where majority are Christians - Catholics precisely.  Well, this brings a lot of memories from gay/lesbo people I know back home.  I wonder what happened to Ojie and his gay friends. He was a hairdresser who rented this little unit in front of our house. It used to be our little sari-sari store turned it into a beauty salon. Imagine how convenient it was for us five teen-age girls and then a few more girl cousins here and there. We sure kept them in business. I remembered Ojie and his gay friends were hilarious when they got together.   urlLink     found some baby pics. Here's the old sari-sari store - Kid A @ 2 with mum and Kid B.   I also have a cousin 3x removed who was gay. His name was Junior. I can assure you Senior wasn't too excited about him. He was gay alright but was not in any way like Ojie. He did not wear women's clothes nor make-up. He was nowhere close to being a drag queen. I could not forget about him because he taught me how to smoke when I was 19. Back then we thought it was cool. Now it think it's dumb!  Now, Junior has a lesbian sis, Abi. She was a total butch. The last time I heard, she wanted to be straight and realized she actually needs a man and wants to start a family. Hmmm, rumors always sound interestingly juicy.  I have another gay cousin 3x removed or whatever. His name  was  Jojo.  Was  because I think now he goes by the name Michelle or some chick name like that. He totally transformed into a pretty girl. And very feminine, more feminine than the females I know. He was beautiful, just like one of those Miss Gay candidates you see on tv (well probably not in US tv). Gay beauty pageants are big in the Philippines. If you get a chance to see these shows do check 'em out - it's quite entertaining.  I also have a lesbian (or so we thought) or should I say bi-sexual first cuz. Buloy as we all call her grew up to be a tomboy. Her friends from college would always think she was a lesbo. We all did. Then she came to the States and things changed. She started dating and fell in love with a guy. She has two adorable kids. She later got divorced. I always thought or noticed she's happier with a girl but she tells me otherwise. Whatever makes her happy makes me happy. She knows I love her dearly.  Whoa, I din't realize there's so many queer in the fam. The list could go on and on and on but I know one thing for sure they're just people like you and me, they can't help not to be gay or lesbian. Understanding, acceptance and tolerance is all we need.  Well thanks to discovery channel it kept me up on the new findings on transexuality and gender issues.  Recent research/studies suggest rather strongly that human sexual orientation is to some degree biologically determined and/or there is a physiological difference between the brains of heterosexual and homosexual men.  Sexual orientation is not a thing you can choose and homosexuality is not just about sex. I understand we - straight people - would say eow or ulk when we see 2 gay men kissing for example, simply because that is not our sexual preference. It doesn't necessarily mean they are bad or "dirty, sick" people. I don't think homos choose to be different, to be laughed at, picked on and be emotionally troubled because they find it fun to be condemned and judged.  If a woman and a man love each other what is it based on? Looks, Sex, Money or Love? Most likely Love, right? So if two people of the same sex love each other, what's so different? Love is love and thatâ€™s what it's all about.  No rainbow disconnection here. I support the  urlLink Rainbow pride  .
