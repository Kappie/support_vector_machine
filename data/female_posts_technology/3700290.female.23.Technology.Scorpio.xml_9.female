After posting the last message, I read upon the last few messages that I posted and I realized that I had taken actions to rectify/improve my "poor" living conditions.   I got myself another bank a/c and I had worked out my own "saving" plans to ensure that my cash inflow and outflow would be balanced. :)  I also got myself re-organized in the sense of my wardrobe, and my studies...  Now what I need to do is to continue my way of savings, concentrate to do well in my studies, and start my ever-procrastinating exercise regime!
