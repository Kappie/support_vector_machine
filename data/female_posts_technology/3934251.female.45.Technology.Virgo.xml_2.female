I just do) I think it's because he's grounded until Saturday morning. He's grounded because I found a packet of my cigarettes in his pocket. (Don't state the obvious, I know I shouldn't be smoking either, but you can't get valium on prescription any more and alcohol makes me feel a bit dodgy when consumed in quantity night after night after night.) It was his second offence of this kind and I don't think a a 48 hour grounding makes me the worst mother in the world.    My husband (mental age of 10) is threatening to leave home because he says he has no authority over the kids, so why should he bother to stay.    My daughter (9) is demanding I buy her a new cover for her mobile (ok, that's not such an issue, but it's the  way  she demands things)    We have to get through a lot more summer holiday before they go back to school. Happy days.    When people ask me why I hate summer so much, I know I don't need to ask them if they have children.
