From where I live, I can look out across the city and see the tops of at least three big fireworks displays, plus whatever explosives the neighbors decide to light. There was a woman and her son lighting Roman candles in the parking lot when I came back inside.  I just hope nothing big catches on fire tonight. We've had some rain, so it isn't as dry as it was, but I still worry that some idiot kids may decide to set off bottle rockets too close to the bosque or something.  I'm trying to decide if I want to bother taking tomorrow off or if it would be better to earn a day of flextime. I doubt I'd be able to get much of anything done on the home front, so maybe I should just go to work. I have a morning meeting on Tuesday, and I'm afraid I'll have a terrible time waking up for it after an extra-long weekend.
