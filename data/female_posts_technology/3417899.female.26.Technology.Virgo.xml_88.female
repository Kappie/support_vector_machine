I am not a part of his life and he is not a part of mine. And I really don't know much about him, except remembering I used to think he was pretty smart.   Today I read about him on a friend's blog. They made a movie.   I watch it over and over and it makes me feel sad. But theres also something romantic about it.  Bottom line - it made me feel. And that's what counts.    urlLink Here it is
