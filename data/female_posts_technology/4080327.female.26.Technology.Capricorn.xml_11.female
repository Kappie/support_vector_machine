I have been hiding away from making a decision - for I do not know whether I will like my decision at the end. That is why I buried my soul into Harry Potter for the past few weeks. Day and night, I look and search for HP. I want to live in the HP fantasy so I wouldn't have to give an answer. I never give my body and brain a chance to rest. I read and re-read HP. I talk HP day-and-night. I watch HP when I am free so I wouldn't have to think of  'other thing'.   And What ' other thing'  is that?  September is approaching. And I will be flying to Auckland. Am I coming back to Malaysia? Am I leaving for good? I have been thinking about that since yesterday's meeting.
