I had to take two buses to get home so you can imagine I'm usually dead beat when I reach home. My work place is 5mins drive away, but the bus ride and the wait will keep me for 30mins. I'm not complaining, I still think that we have a good public transport infrastructure here.   The bus was crowded with uni kids and working adults. Standing near the exit resulted me getting 'assulted' by big bags and files. I got scratched by some idiot who didn't know how to hug her file when it's crowded like that. And people with big bags should not be allowed on crowded buses! I'm not frail but it was really getting on my nerve. By the time I alighted at my stop, I was as grouchy as Oscar in Sesame Street.   I thought to myself. I need to go out, relax and chill. I scrolled through my mental list of possiple chill-mate but there was none I could call and get positive respond. Maybe I'm cynical, skeptical, or just isn't trying at all. I was thinking of a dear friend in a distant land and wish that I'm there, or he's here.  I stepped into my room, dropped my bag and keys on the floor, and slumped onto my bed without even changing out of my day clothes. Suddenly, I was 'at peace'... I was just lieing there, with the world cut off, thinking, stoning, staring and dozing off.   It was 10pm when I opened my eyes again. That turn out alright. No chill, no mates, no booze but it was alright. I made a mental note, to remember to remove the contact lenses the next time.
