It hasn’t been that long but it still feels a little slow sometimes because my life isn’t as exciting here as compared to when I was in Manila. My friends are all there so I don’t have any reason to stay out late on Friday or Saturday nights and get into all sorts of misadventures.  Anyway, what is life like for me here in Singapore? Monday to Friday, I go to work 9:00- 6:00. That’s the official time, but more often than not, I have to stay a little later to get some urgent stuff done. I once stayed in the office until 6:00 A.M. the next day but that’s the exception rather than the rule. After some time it got really boring to have that routine so I signed up for gym classes. So now, I have Yoga on Tuesdays/Saturdays and Aerobics on Thursday nights. I refuse to step into a gym and lift weights because I am one of those women who develop muscles easily and I am not interested in bulking up anymore.  On Wednesdays, I study Basic Mandarin just so my boss will get off my case for not studying any Chinese dialect.  Weekends? I wake up really late on Saturdays and Sundays. I want to make up for the sleep I don’t get on weekdays. Saturday is really my leisure day so I go shopping, watch movies, and basically bum around when I can. Sunday is chores day. That means I have to do my laundry, ironing, cleaning my room, and cooking all my meals for that week. After doing that for the last few months, I realized why I refused to get married years ago. I can barely manage a household for myself. How would I be able manage for 3 other people? You can’t exactly hire a maid here in Singapore because it is expensive and impractical.  When people ask me how I can survive in Singapore when it is such a boring place as compared to Manila, I just always say, “I’m in rehab.” Now that I am here in Singapore, I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, I rarely stay out late. I spend my free time at home reading books, watching TV, listening to music, cross-stitching, cooking- stuff I really like doing. Anytime I feel like it, I go to the malls and watch movies. Recently, I even started a new hobby, solving 1000 pieces jigsaw puzzles.   I live in suburban Singapore, particularly in the Simei area. Rent is cheaper. There is much more space to walk around. Plus, it’s really convenient because there are 3 malls I can easily get to. It may be a 25-minute ride to the main business district, but I don’t really mind the travel time because it’s a very relaxing place to live in. Once convenient thing about my place though is that it only takes 15 minutes for me in a cab to get to the airport.  I guess that should be enough for now. I’m thinking of what else to write about next….
