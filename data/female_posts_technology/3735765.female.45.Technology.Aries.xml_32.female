I was in the United Way office today and they had a Williamson County Bicycle Map available. It was interesting because it not only mentioned the pathways designed specifically for bicyclists in this region, it also specifies the safety features of various roadways and highways throughout the county.  It does have a disclaimer that it "was developed to aid bicyclists in finding their way safely through Williamson County.  This is not a map of existing bikeways, but an evaluation of Williamson County's street and road network."  This particular map was produced through a company called ProLinks (Productivity Links, Inc.).  I would suggest contacting them to see if they have such a map designed for your county as well --  ProLinks .  Special note:  This same company, its corporate offices strategically placed in The Woodlands TX, has been involved with organizations such as the Montgomery County Genealogical and Historical Society and the Taminia Community with projects involving GPS mapping of various cementaries in their county.  Their projects are limitless and have many more listed on their website; be sure to check out  ProLinks !! :)
