There was still not a chasiubao that could stand up to the Golden Gate Bakery Buns.  I rated a few places and put the ratings up on the picture page listed below.  I've rediscovered my love of photography.  It has something to do with my time in film school and being in such an exciting and novel place.  There's always some moment occuring around me that seems unique and individual enough that it demands to be recorded.  I've been playing around with some Walker Evans style candid city life shots and some macro texture shots.  None of it's too original, but it's still fun.  The pictures from Chinatown and Maria and Sarah's Wedding are up at:  urlLink  http://www.seq.org/~acasteel/NY/index.htm
