Worked on the songs that John gave me. I am getting so ancy cause I want to jam so bad.  I asked Mike to do a show w/ us on the 22 of May. He has to look and see what other shows he has booked.  Man that would be so weird doing a show w/ V90!  Cool, but weird.  Started writing a song.  The lyrics that I have been writing are very depressing though. Of course it is about the whole situation w/ Vic.  It was 2 months ago yesterday that all of this started and it still affects me like it was yesterday.  I so badly want to talk to Shannon, but I am sure we will never speak again.  I hope she is doing ok.  She can't handle a lot going on at once and w/ planning her wedding and her band and her son she has a lot on her plate right now.  Tomorrow is Friday and I am so glad. Going to be busy all weekend.  Will I ever get a day to just vedge? Yeah, when I am dead. LOL
