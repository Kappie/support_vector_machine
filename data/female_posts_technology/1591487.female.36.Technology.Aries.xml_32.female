I feel I peaked too early with the whole Christmas-spirit thing and now I just feel depleted.  Also, I'm sick of eating.  I know that this is very difficult to believe, but I'm sick of it.  I have had at least one meal out for the past eight days and frankly, I'm so over restaurant/cafe food.  If anyone says the word 'coulis' or 'jus' to me, I think I'll burst into tears.    I really think you can have too much of  good thing, and clearly I've reached my limit.  Even the thought of having one of my beloved mince pies has paled.   I'm hoping that all the food I've eaten in the past week will actually suffice for my energy intake for the whole of 2004 and I won't have to have anything at all for the next 12 months. Think of all the money I'll save.  But I musn't grumble, it's so easy to complain about Christmas isn't it? Such an insane time of year, it's really a time of excess - food, drink, spending, however, the only excess we never seem to have is time.  And really, a few more hours in the day would be the best present of all at this stage.  I've realised that there's a reason to take holidays at Christmas away from the workplace, because the only people who work through Christmas and New Year are the miserable ones, the anti-festive people who have nothing else in their lives. (Of course I do not include all those wonderful people such as doctors, nurses, emergency services, 24 petrol station employees who have to keep the rest of the world going through this time).  I can't help feeling resentful when somebody actually wants work done today.  But really, I only have myself to blame, don't I?   Oh my goodness, maybe I'm one of those people! Argghh!  I am looking forward to a lovely day tomorrow, I am looking forward to a day of R on Friday also.    I am a lucky girl, to be looking forward to a lovely Christmas, to be able to have spent time with family and friends during this time.   Okay, I think I've talked myself back into the Christmas spirit! Yay!
