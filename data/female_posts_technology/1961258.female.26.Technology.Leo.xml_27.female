I'm supposed to be at least 68kg (which is fat as well) .. and really should only be 45 - 55 kg! I can't imagine that. I have an extra one half of a whole person. I weigh more than a man, a man who's much taller than me.    At least it scared me into really moving my butt. I've been exercising pretty regularly and upping the duration and intensity for the past 3 days. So today I hit 45 minutes on the treadmill, did some crunches and very light arms, legs. And I did it in the morning! Which is such a miracle. The doing at least 10min per day thing works. In the end I don't only do 10 minutes, by the time I hit that mark .. I think it's more worth it to go to 15 .. then 20 .. then 25 .. then 30 .. and on  on! So yeah it's a good plan, tricking myself that way :)   Now, I have to watch what I eat. Honestly once you exercise, you rethink it before you put something in your mouth. You go .. I just worked my a** off on the treadmill for about an hour and if I eat this or this, it'll negate all that. At least that's how it is for me :) I need to make a habit of this.   Back to 155lbs within 2 months. I did it last year so should be a snap. Then .. 4 lbs each month, and voila .. by the end of 2004, you can have a new start with your new body.      And I so want a buff body. I keep on mentioning this but i am so sick (with myself) when I see people who can wear whatever they want and look soooooooo good. I want to be one of those women who can bounce quarters off my stomach  my butt, have thighs that don't touch, arms that don't jiggle. I don't think I should be satisfied with just being a healthy weight. At least once in my life, I'd like to unveil the smokin' body I know I have under all the fat.
