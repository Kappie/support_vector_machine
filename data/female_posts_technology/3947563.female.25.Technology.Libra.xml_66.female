I love reading what you guys write, though... keeps me motivated. Keep it up, ladies! We're almost half way through!  Friday - breakfast: corn flakes and blueberries, lunch : a few cashews (I slept my lunch in the park!), dinner : 1 and 1/2 pork chop with tomatoes and broccoli, snack - raspberry sorbet. Exercise - busting a gut laughing. "Jello Pudding Cups!"  Saturday - lunch: cup of chili, 2 beef fajitas, light on the sourcream/cheese, dinner: clamchowder and garlic bread (yikes!). Exercise - parked at the far end of the Woodbine Racetrack parking lot (Casey would be proud of me :P) which is one hell of a walk and earned us some funny looks from the security guards, and walked around Port Credit for a halfhour, looking for a decent place to eat.  BTW: Premier Fitness is having a deal right now where you can get a 3-month membership for $89! I think Rick and I are going to check it out b/c they have an olympic size swimming pool at the one near our house. :)  I went to the Mississauga Farmers Market this morning... I love shopping for veggies there! For $20, you can get more food than you can carry. Not to mention, every vendor wants you to taste thier latest crop; its a smorgesbord (sp?). Raspberries are on the way out, but melons and tomatoes are coming in.  Speaking of which, I hope you guys like tomatoes b/c there's no way Rick and I will eat all the tomatoes that are coming in in my garden so I'll probably be bringing some to work for you folks!
