Now, it would have been so much cooler had it said, "Don't Mess with Texas!".   Especially since they are trade-marking that phrase! :).  Talking of Texas, it is always important to note that the Dallas Cowboys SUCK!!!!    Yes - I have strong feelings in that arena.  I am a big football buff.  I love the NFL.  My favorite team is the Buffalo Bill's.  They give me a warm fuzzy feeling.  I'm elated when they win, and quite pouty when they lose.   Being a Bill's fan - I have my own little football axis of evil:  1)  Miami Dolphin's:  Because I'm a Bill's fan.  Duh.  Dolphins gear offends me.  I had to make sure some guy in the bar knew that last night too.    2)  Oakland Raiders:   They are ineffable evil.  They play dirty.  I can't respect a team whose players who make it their modus operandi to cheat and hurt players on the opposing team.  It's evil and I don't like them.  They are a bunch of PUNKS!!!!  3) As previously established, The Dallas Cowboys :  They too, are a bunch of silly punks.  The Cowboys are comprised of Wife beaters, druggies and thugs.  And - Seriously!  Was there an election?  Because I certainly didn't vote them, "America's Team" as they bill themselves.   Clever piece of marketing buck-o - but I'm not buying it.    Yes, I'm passionate about my football.  I love it. I am a fantasy coach.  And I follow it almost religiously.  My Fantasy team is named the, Soul Rippers.  My guy friends teased me that I would have some cute, fluffy name.  Like the Cute Socks or something - Or the pink fluffy bunnies - so I went the extreme opposite with the meanest name I could conjure.    My pick 'em league name is the "Fighting Cacti".  Which amused me for some reason.  But then, I find I get more fun out of life by being easily amused, than by being jaded.  Just for today - Be happy!! cutesox
