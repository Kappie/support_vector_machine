I wrote to him yesterday morning and it is today afternoon and he still has not replied! My email heart is bruised! My reeling imagination does not help matters much. Here is the email that he has yet to compose:   Dear Batty, Though I enjoyed exchanging emails at first with you, it seems that as I get to know you better, I would like to get to know you less. I do not appreciate disparaging remarks aimed at our co-workers, “Ren-fair hairdo” or not. Despite my tattoos, I am a sensitive man who aches at the hurtful comments you indiscriminately fling at everyone in this office. Have you no mercy? I am scared to open your emails because of what you may write next. I am not concerned with who needs a makeover or who needs to lop off their ponytail or whose manboobs are getting bigger. That is none of my business, nor should it be any of yours. It is apparent that you detest your job, but I love mine. I cannot further associate with you because of the harm it may bring to my position in the company. Computer code encryption gives me boners like nobody’s business, so a word to you my ex-friend: if you can’t swing on the library software automation swing, then get off the swing. You catch my drift? When I come back, let’s pretend we don’t know each other, okay?   Miggidy Mickey    P.S. Give me back my Pee-Wee doll you thief.
