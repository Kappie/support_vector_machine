I grind my teeth in my sleep, so the filling was weakened by that.  Now that same tooth is fractured and I need a crown.  That will be $950 and is not covered under my basic dental plan.  I did take out $500 worth of elective coverage, but I will need a nightguard ($230)to keep me from damaging the crown (or other teeth.)    I know I'm lucky to have a dental plan, but I will still be paying over $600 out of my own pocket (a.k.a. Visa, and that is going to hurt until I find a second job.  Back to my point - there is big money in dentistry.  If you like people being afraid of you and you aren't grossed out easily I say think of dentistry as a career.
