Good thing I brought other projects down here with me :-)  Started and finished another Splash scarf, this one in blues. I made this one a bit narrower than the first one, so it's quite a bit longer. Now Tiffany wants one, so I'll be picking up yarn for that tomorrow. And the kitty bed is progressing quite nicely. I don't see how any cat could NOT want to cuddle up against this stuff, it's so fuzzy-fun-comfy. Now I want to make one for every cat I know. Wonder if the shelter would appreciate donations.
