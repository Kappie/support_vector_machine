Honestly, most of my content is done over at quixotica.com, there is tons of content there.   More art here. See how that works? I got a job last July in the Agribiz, doing web things.   Last semester I took a drawing course, which was wonderful and time consuming and I learned a lot, but had no time for personal art.  There is a new piece finished for this year though, fanart for Game Neverending. Check it out -->   jaenwhufs.html   Obviously the redesign hasn't happened, we'll see what does.   Cheers! Happy New Year
