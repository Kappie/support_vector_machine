To be able to make a point on paper and have others interpret your point as you want them to, must be very fulfilling.  What I have noticed as a result of reading the many different essays from “The Familiar Essay” textbook is that there is no right or wrong thing to say or write. It is how you say  and write it and when you say it. For example, writing from a child’s perspective is much more effective in the story “Coon Hunt” than it would have been had it been presented from an adults point of view. The short, direct sentences help us to understand the underlying message this author was trying to convey. I was fascinated by the subtleness the author used to present the abuse she was being subjected to by her father.   I have become much more aware of the underlying messages that a writer can weave into their stories. Often times this message can be missed if you are not actually looking for something. Reading a story more than once can give you a whole new perspective on what the author is writing about. I have found it very interesting when talking in class about stories that we have read, how one person can “read” a story so differently than another. When discussing the same story among class members, I love to hear all the different interpretations of the exact same story.
