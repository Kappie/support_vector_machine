If this is what he thinks is appropriate behavior, what would he think is appropriate when he would be representing the United States as whole (withhold the slam)- to people who hold our fates in their hands? Did his people even have the time to read the 9/11 Commission report? For God's sake, he was out pitching a baseball at some ball park while Bush was reading what the report had to say! He has a track record of being non-participative, as does his Vice Presidential Candidate. Kerry has the highest non participation rate and Edwards has the second highest. Why would either of them work harder than they currently do now when placed in new positions?
