No more standing on the scale, adjusting my stance .. and seeing different values at different times of the day (5lbs. difference? puhleeze).   Unfortunately I'm now at 80kg and 44% bodyfat (i think .. well, it's above 40%) which is SO not good. My sis is at 55kg and 19%, which is perfect. Ouch .. so so horrible. I don't want to be this fat anymore.  I've been so depressed lately .. i have an issue with a certain part of my body and it's consuming all my thoughts. I want to go back 6 months ago and change it, or not make such a stupid decision.
