I clearly remember that Rick had something to each which wasn't what I had eaten, because I remember wanting him to hurry up and finish his dinner so that we could go to the library. Dammit, why can't I remember?! I've literally been sitting here for the past 20 minutes trying to remember. Grrr.... I went for a walk, and did some more stretching and weight lifting. Btw, my situps scare the bejeezus out of my cats because they can't figureout why I'm lying on the ground. :)   Tuesday - to spice it up, I had a banana/raspberry/blueberry smoothey for breakfast, had a baked potato w/ sour cream for lunch, and had two tortilla/creamcheese pinwheels for dinner, with some baked fish (minced something or other) and half a cantalope. I had a wanger of a headache (probably from the funky weather we've been having) so I didn't do much butread and play with kittens (they're going back to the shelter in 3 days! :( )   I'm getting a little bored with the shakes and tuna for lunch, so its time to start mixing up my breakfasts and lunches. Rick has been really supportive, in as much as he lets me cook my own dinners (rather than for both of us) and he does the dishes. :)
