But you brought my life up from the pit, O LORD my God.  7 'When my life was ebbing away, I remembered you, LORD, and my prayer rose to you, to your holy temple.  8 'Those who cling to worthless idols forfeit the grace that could be theirs. 9 But I, with a song of thanksgiving, will sacrifice to you. What I have vowed I will make good. Salvation comes from the LORD.'   No matter how bad it gets, God will still protect and save you, as long as you remember him and continue to pray to him. Don't worship idols instead of God and give up all that he can provide to you. Worship God and he will give you salvation.  I still have a hard time with the story of Jonah, accepting it as literal truth. But whether it is or isn't, the message is the same. It really doesn't matter how hard things get, even being close to death.  God is going to be there to protect you and save you.  You just have to keep worshiping him, and praying to him, and he'll give you salvation.
