What is that over there?" Trellian turned a hard right almost upsetting the wizard into free flight.   The wizard grabbed hold and looked where the dragon had turned. Billows of smoke appeared from the trees like a forest fire. They circled closer to the smoke but couldn't make out anything. The smoke teared their eyes which made them turn away and to try again from another direction.   "What is that smell?" The wizard yelled as he wiped his eyes on his sleeve.  "I am not sure. I could hazard a few guesses but I would rather not at this point." The dragon hollered back as he circled around the smoke.
