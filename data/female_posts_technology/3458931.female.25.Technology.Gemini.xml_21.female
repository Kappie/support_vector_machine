I filled the bowl halfway with very hot water and managed to scrape about 90% of the putrid black woolly growth into the toilet. The last of the organic matter was easily brushed away with soapy water.   I have triumphed over the bowl but though the battle is won, the war wages on. I now face the remains of my enemy in the bathtub. I think it has a strategic advantage. It knows I have only two options; push it down the drain it is poised so precariously near, or scoop it into some sort of transfer vehicle and have it join its' fallen comrade in the toilet. I could turn on the water to try and flush some of it away, but I risk the possibility that the tub will fill up and the scum will spread itself around. I must prevail, I want to take a shower.
