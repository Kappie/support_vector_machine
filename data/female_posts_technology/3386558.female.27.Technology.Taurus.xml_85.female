YEA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      these are the kinds of things i look forward to. like seeing the odometer hit 12,345 or the one time i got to see it hit 100,000. what a treat. it's life's little pleasures that mean so much. "the moment your laughter becomes a cackle."       i started reading  ERAGON  by Christopher Paolini. so far, it is unbelievable and ihighly recommend it. i will admit, what first attracted me to the book was the author. i read a small blurb about him, and decided i had to read the book out of mere curiosity. Paolini graduated from high school at age 15, and immediately started to write this book afterwards. his family helped him to self-publish, and by the age of 17, the book was out. now at age 19, he has sold tens of thousands of copies of this book, and the numbers keep rising. he is #3 on the New York Times best-sellers list for children's chapter books. this would put his right up there with  Harry Potter,  and this is where he belongs. the book has a  Lord of the Rings  meets  Harry Potter  kind of feel to it. The author is extremely talented, and i was happy to find out that this book will in fact be part of a trilogy, the next installment due out next year. i always root for the young writer; they usually don't get the credit they deserve. it has been rumored that this guy may actually surpass Tolkien's legacy with this trilogy. and why not; it is a new century.
