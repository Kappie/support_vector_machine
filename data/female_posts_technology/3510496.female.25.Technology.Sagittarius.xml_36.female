But I only need you, one time, call me 'Abang'.  blearghhhhhhhhhh!  urlLink     That is truly against the Act of "Liza's Ethics" under Section "What to call your husband?".  Wife *sarcastically*: Bila masa I kahwin dengan abang you, or you kahwin dengan kakak I sampai I nak kena call you itu?  I have nothing against other wives calling their husbands 'Abang', but it's just isn't me. Ironically, I call hubby, 'Baiyaa' (reads: Brother or Abang in Hindi/Urdu). I should give these credits to my 2 flower-girls (Paki-blood) who 'manja'-ly always call upon hubby, "Baiyaa... Baiyaa!". Thus the word kept rhyming in me, and I love it, so be it.  Despite constant tickering from the girls' mommy and other Indian pals to stop calling him 'Baiyaa', I simply can't after constant toungueing  urlLink    it for the past 4 years.  (This is a gentle note to dearest husband)  ~~~~~~~~~~  Interruption for an announcement.  urlLink You ,  urlLink you ,  urlLink you  and  urlLink you ! Take note. July 31st 14 30 hours @ CBTL Boat-Key. Can? RSVP via  urlLink her  shoutbox.  N.B. Kindly leave 'baggage' (Reads: Another way to call husband from  urlLink her  dictionary) at the comfort of your shack.
