Books touch me in a way that no other media can.  I can travel the universe inside my head -- and what a strange and wonderful journey it can be.  Some say why read when you can get out and do, I say why not read on your way to the doing.  What I love almost as much as reading is being able to share the books I read with others.  So without further ado I give you my June reading list.  Feel free to leave comments or suggestions.    urlLink The Dark Elf Trilogy  This is one of those books that I can't imagine living my life without having read.  It didn't change my life or teach me how to be a better person, instead it created such a vivid world in my head that I felt as if I had lived life alongside the main characters.  Their struggles were my struggles, their fears my fears, their happiness my happiness.  Not since "Lord of the Rings" have I felt so utterly immersed in a storyline.    Speaking of "Lord of the Rings" I've heard a lot of people compare the two trilogies.  I'm kind of on the fence as to whether or not that's a good comparison.  I can understand why some people may find them similar, both are epic, sweeping tales that span generations and share the underlying theme of good versus evil, but to me that's where the similarities end.  The characters are written differently, developed differently.     Another reason I'm so in love with this book is that it is just the first (chronologically) of many in what I call the Dark Elf Series.  I just ordered the next two trilogies in the series and can't wait to begin reading them.   Do yourself a favor and give this book a chance.  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at how wonderful it really is.    urlLink Under the Tuscan Sun  I honestly didn't expect to enjoy this book that much, not even sure why I got it.  It was one of those books that you add to your wishlist and forget about until someone gives it to you as a gift.    I read this book mostly while I was at the hospital visiting my mother-in-law.  We spent long nights at the hospital and this book helped to pass the time.  I can still smell the hospital when I think of this book.  Crammed in a small couch in the corner of the room, barely enough light to make out the words on the page.  It's a good book, full of Tuscan imagery and history.  Definitely a worthy read, not the best I've read but no book is ever a waste.  I learned a lot about life in another country, small hints at what my life may have been like if my ancestors had never boarded the Mayflower.      urlLink The Bookseller of Kabul  A glimpse into the life of an Afghan family seemed timely.  With everything going on in the world I hoped to gain a better understanding of life in Afghanistan both pre and post Taliban.  Some parts, especially about life as a woman, make me so mad that I want to put the book down and never read it again.  I find it amazing how strong these Afghan women really are.  Some may see weakness, I see only courage.  They posses more strength than any Western woman who has been handed her rights on a silver platter.  Even with the everyday barriers that are placed in their way, they manage to persevere with grace and acceptance.    urlLink Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  Fun read.  Made the smart move of reading the book before seeing the movie.  Never was able to get through the first two books after seeing the movies.  Too similar I suppose.
