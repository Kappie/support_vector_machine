I did have porridge though, for breakfast, and that kind of made everything okay again.  My weekend was slightly weird.  Starting off okay, with a weird bit in the middle and then ending up okay again with a bit of an ice skating fairy tale bonanza.  It was, I guess, a kind of 'bookended weirdness weekend'.  I guess it mainly had to do with taking my Dad to the hospital.   Oh, he's okay, thankfully. But gosh, when you calmly walk into the house and announce that the doctor suggested it might be a 'good idea' to go to the hospital after suffering from chest pains for TWO fucking days. Well, yeah. You can't expect us not to go a little wiggy.  Poor J-Girl, who was eating cheese at the time at my house and had to be ushered out hastily all because of my father's denial of his health. Sorry J-Girl!   I feel I would like to take this opportunity to lament about the state of both the public and private health sector. The first question one is now asked when seeking medical assistance is not 'How are you?' but 'How are you going pay,  girlfriend ??". And I mean  girlfriend  because clearly, there's a bit of an attitude going on with the whole paying thing in hospitals nowadays.    Honestly, the payment information/waiver which was shoved in my face the second we stepped inside the sliding doors  could have said '..EFTPOS, Credit or Cash ..oh, and you will sell your soul to the Devil'.  I didn't give a shit at the time and just wanted someone to make sure my father was going to be okay.  How bizarre! I hope I haven't sold my soul to the Devil? Although, he'll soon realise he'll want his money back, so I'm not too worried.  Anyway, clearly when there are heart issues with people they don't mess around in the emergency medical care area (the cynical part of me believing this to be that if someone does cark it in the waiting room, who's going to pay the fucking bill?).  We were pretty much ushered in almost straight away.  The upshot being that my father's heart is okay and his lungs are fine too. Apparently. Despite being a smoker for 60 years. Can you believe that? My Dad is some freaky dude.  I guess that goes a long way to explaining, well, me.  After the initial relief that it wasn't a heart attack and while we were waiting for other tests just to make sure I entertained myself by eavesdropping on the other patients and their associated dilemmas in the next bay in the emergency room.  The first woman had been thrown off her horse and broken her arm. She seemed to be in a lot of pain (er, DER) The moaning was a bit disconcerting, but then almost immediately she seemed perky and fine.  Morphine rocks, clearly.  I did secretly giggle at the nasty jokes about the fate of the horse made by her father and husband. For example 'well, I know what the dogs will be eating for the next couple of months heheheh'  one of them said at one point. (I am not making this up, by the way).  The second woman came in and starting describing her symptoms.  Hmm, I thought.  Clearly, she has had a panic attack.  The doctor examined her and proclaimed  "You've had a panic attack".   YESSS! I whispered. How good am I? I said to dad, "I should be a doctor". He gave me the 'dad look' that said 'you should be an idiot'.    That's when I knew he would be okay.
