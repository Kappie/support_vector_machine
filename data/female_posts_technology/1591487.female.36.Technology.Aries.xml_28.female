It started off as very useful tool for communication with colleagues in different parts of this vast compound I work in, to answer quick questions, check on pending things etc.  However, I now feel my Instant Messages are becoming 'public domain' with people 'impersonating' other users responding to my messages. How old are we? What's going on? It's ridiculous.  The thing, is that it's making me laugh, and I'm always waiting for the next message.  So unprofessional.  It's such an inappropriate forum for some of the things which are being discussed too.  Surely, there's some way of vetting the things which are said on these applications?   However, the sad thing is that  urlLink Peter  is leaving to go to Japan today, although really we should all be used to him going somewhere after that whole 'moving to Melbourne' deal.  I wish him lots of luck and Japanese fun. He'll be a star in Japan, I feel that he'll end up on some TV show either as a host, or as a regular commentator on the Western perspective to pop culture.  They'll call him Peter-san and have pictures of him on packets of noodles in vending machines.  Bon Voyage, Peter!
