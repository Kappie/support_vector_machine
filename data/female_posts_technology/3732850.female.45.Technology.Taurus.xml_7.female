She loves them so much, but when she eats certain ones they give her a thing on her mouth that looks like a cold sore. I always and sometimes forget to tell them at Burger King no tomatoes on my whopper because I know she loves them. At Burger King their tomatoes don't bother her.  I like the smile she gets when she see tomatoes. She gets so excited that I think she could jump out of her skin. I wish she would like other foods like that. The only time I really like tomaotes is when I eat B.L.T's. My son takes the tomatoes out and my husband just plainly doesn't order that sandwich, he can eat them on a whopper. I think she's the only one in the family that likes them. So every once in awhile I will buy them tomatoes for her, i like buying special things like that for my family. When, I was kid I liked them with suggar, but I'm not going to introduce that sugar thing to her! I hope she enjoys them when she grows up.
