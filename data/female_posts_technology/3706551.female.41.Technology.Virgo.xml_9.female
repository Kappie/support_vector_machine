And she is SO shy! Clearly the only place that she is truly comfortable on-stage is behind her baby grand. But it's one of the things that makes her utterly charming. And Diana, if any of your peeps are reading this (three cheers for webot spiders),THANK YOU SO MUCH for taking the stage on time! This shows that you respect value your fans. Unlike this  urlLink rock divum  (what is the masculine form of diva? divum??) who was a full HOUR late in taking the stage.    Back to Ms. Diana! Her voice is pure heaven! and her piano playing divine. Her humor is very understated  sotto voce (under her breath) ..... so you better listen up, or you'll miss her true wit  charm. Typical New England humor from the girl from Nanaimo, B.C. It will take me weeks to come down from this high. There is only 1 other concert that effected me thus--ly. Click  urlLink here  formusical greatness.  urlLink Here  is pretty damn great too.    So if you'll pardon me while I go buy EVERY CD that Diana has ever made ...... later folks.
