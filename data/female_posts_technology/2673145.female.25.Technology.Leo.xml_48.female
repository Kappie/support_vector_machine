It is about obesity problems in America and an experiment on the narator/creator was done to show how bad fast food are.  The experiment is carried out over 30 days, where the guy had to eat Mac meals.. 3 times a day. At the end of it, he got serious problems such as liver failure, depression, and bad sex life. (haha)  Very interesting, although some parts I almost wanted to sleep when the experts are talking away. But it shows you the seriousness of the problem and how big the fast food meals are at the States. At the end of the film, I don't feel like having fast food or coke at all. Hahah..   The idea is.. moderation...
