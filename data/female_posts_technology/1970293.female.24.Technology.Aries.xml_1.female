I can still remember the night my brother got me to watch the show.  It was late and I was tired but I stayed awake with determination.  I can't remember which episode it was but I do remember the Doctor was Sylvestor McCoy with I believe Mel as his assistant.  I believe it was right before Ace became the assistant.  Now remember that I was watching this in the states and the PBS station had the show on right after Red Dwarf at around midnight.  It was so weird that I had to watch it again the next week.    Soon I had met the Daleks and the Cybermen as well as the Master with his evil plans.  I have to say that the Daleks were so unique that I still go around sometimes saying "Exterminate. Exterminate."  The Cybermen with their strange warfare and way of walking.  The Master I believe had to be the most interesting because here you learn that at one time he was also a Time Lord.  It really takes you back when you find that out that you wonder about the Doctor's own past.
