If you say, "Rock!" it switches the settings to play rock music!   If you say "Classical", it switches settings and plays Classical music!   On my way home last night some kids ran out in front of my car.   I hit the brakes and yelled "F*cking Kids" and the radio started playing Michael Jackson. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
