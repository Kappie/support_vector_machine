After (almost) 2 wks of planning, 5 turned up for the barby (instead of 8). Some of them had to go for their mum's day celebration. One just didn't want to come. The reason given didn't really convince me.   Anyhow, we didn't succeed in playing mahjong (the other two gals were busy chopping and marinating meat), neither did I manage to have a dip at the pool. I end up being too hot and sticky to change out of my flithy clothes. The thot of changing back into those undergarments and clothes puts me off. It's better to stay with them until I get to the shower room at home.   Food was alright. As usual, we bought too much, and exceeded our budget. Sigh.. all those seafood. I bought a bottle of Lindeman's chardonnay and it sorta lighten up some of our moods and the night was beginning to be a little crazy and fun. Pity there's only enough for 5 full plastic cups. Anyhow, it was soon time to pack up and go. I'm greatful for my dear sis who drove all the way to pick me up. I was so tired and alcohol made me sleepy.  Still, I think barby is a hassle and dont wish to have another one. Unless I dont have to lift a finger.
