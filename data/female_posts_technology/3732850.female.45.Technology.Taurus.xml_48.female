Then I thought of tape but realized that helps with wrapping presents so the thing i find meaningless is butter or margarine.  I just don't see the difference.  I can take it or leave.  All i ever had was margarine and I was fine with that.  My sister-in-law grew up on butter but my brother says the same thing i do.  Margarine is cheaper and to my brother and i, there really isn't much difference to us.  Reminds me of when i make chocolate chip cookies.  I use two sticks of margarine and the thought never occurred to me to use butter.  When i make chocolate chips bars, i use margarine.  In fact, i only buy butter when it is cheap enough.  It has to be on sale for me.  I don't know what the point of this meaningless subject is and i can't find an end.  The only time I have used butter is if i have bought it on sale and use when i make mashed potatoes but it makes no difference to me because it tastes the same to me even if i use margarine and i don't even think my sister-in-law can tell the difference then.  Especially, if gravy is poured over the top of the mashed potatoes when eating them.  How would anyone know which one i used, butter or margarine.  I guess the point I see myself coming to is "Buy margarine! It's Cheaper!
