How is it that a random sampling of 12 people has never seen  The Mummy ?  Because if they had, they wouldn't be running around saying, "What the hell is a scarab?????"  If your brother's knees are bad, can't you just suck up and dig through the sand?  He's been travelling in pain all day, you owe him a finish to the race.  Is the bidget* insane?  She tries to steal a cab and when it doesn't work calls the other team crazy.  And carrying goats causes her to think she's going to die.  If I were her cousin, I'd climb up on a chair and give that whiny thing a big ol' smack up the side of the head.  Arrrrrrrr.  I be feelin' better now.  *bidget:  bid-jet (noun)  a big idiot or big midget.  take your pick.
