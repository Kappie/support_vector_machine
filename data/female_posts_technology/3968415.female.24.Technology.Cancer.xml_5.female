With so many responsibilities and only 9 hours of available meeting times, there are often tug-o-OKWs. Today, i happen to withness the most verbal and balant!   Contestants  On my right: Ms Whinny-Gotta-Do-It-For-Me On my left: Mr I-Am-Not-Yielding-To-U   Round 1, Fight!     Ms Whinny-Gotta-Do-It-For-Me : " Hey, can u release OKW for this meeting i have at 4pm?" Mr I-Am-Not-Yielding-To-U : " I cannot. This is a very impt meeting with Mr HIT-man, we have to decide and commit deadlines, so we can go talk to Mr Big-Shot-User on Monday"  Ms Whinny-Gotta-Do-It-For-Me : " But i booked him so long ago, u cannot just barge in like that." Mr I-Am-Not-Yielding-To-U : " We need to look at the importance of the meeting. Can't someone else stand in place of OKW for your closure meeting?? "  Ms Whinny-Gotta-Do-It-For-Me : " No. No one can stand in for the almighty OKW. Can someone else like Mr Probably-Know-Not-What-To-Say stand in for OKW on ur side then?" Mr I-Am-Not-Yielding-To-U : " Of cos cannot, he will not know what to say!! "  Ms Whinny-Gotta-Do-It-For-Me : "Can u help me out on this?" Mr I-Am-Not-Yielding-To-U : " If i help you, who will help me?"  Ms Whinny-Gotta-Do-It-For-Me : "This is really important and it is very difficult to get everyone. " Mr I-Am-Not-Yielding-To-U : "So yours is high priority lah... Must give in to you issit?"  Ms Whinny-Gotta-Do-It-For-Megasped in desperation and picks up the phone to call the secretary of Mr Hit-Man to try to push the meeting back for Mr I-Am-Not-Yielding-To-U.  After which, Mr I-Am-Not-Yielding-To-U called the same secretary NOT to push back the meeting andmade her remind Mr Hit-Man to be on time for the meeting.   Till the next time of "Tug-O-OKW ". Stay tuned.     *man.. I would hate to be the secretary*
