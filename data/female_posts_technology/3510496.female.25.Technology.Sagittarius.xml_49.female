In addition, sent her a packet of  nasi lemak  (uikkks, bit heavy leyyy) while she'd just about to 'entertain' her 1st user problem. So sweet, sweet wife, put aside that problem, and spared time to have breakfast with sweet, sweet hubby at the company's canteen. And sweet, sweet wife wants to tell sweet, sweet hubby not to forget to check the 'Love Notes' she 'vandalise' on the bathroom mirror, before they left home (simply ways to keep the  flame alive ).  As another sweet gesture, sweet, sweet wife told sweet, sweet hubby, there's no need to fetch her from office later. Sweet, sweet her said she terribly misses taking public transport  . The real intention is, sweet, sweet her wants to do a little of her own grocery shopping  . Sweet, sweet her wants to prepare pita with *roasted* chicken fillings.  She is making her own roasted chicken. 2 chickens already marinated are awaiting for her in the fridge, to be send for roasting. She not so sure whether the chickens will turn out well. But in case of emergency she will send force to get the honey-roasted chicken at Causeway Point. Hahah!!  After that, sweet, sweet her will feed roasted chicken pitas to her sweet, sweet hubby. Then she will make enough roasted chicken pitas for her sweet, sweet family across the street. So everybody will have roasted chicken pitas.    I Declare It's Pita Day, today!!!!!
