You know, that's the thing about me--I like feedback. I like to to hear some applause if I do a good job, I like to be criticized if I'm off-base. At least I know where I stand.  On Monday everyone sort of moved like sheep, not really sure if the message was "Welcome to Motorola, you're fired, go eat a Danish" or not.  People really were as glum as the day.  I guess I can't blame them. At least for the week that I was putting the party together,  I was able to push it to the back of my mind that Motorola doesn't really need me much after the end of the month.  Others probably aren't so lucky.  So there was no feedback at all, not a thanks, not a 'good job,' not a 'that really sucked.' Nothing.  But at least I feel in my mind I did a good job, and I have pictures to prove it.  On Wednesday, Thomas called me. You could have knocked me over with a feather. We talked for two and a half hours. (Yeah, Nancy's in Ecuador.) It was our first "normal" conversation in the year 2004, and it almost made me think I have a friend in him again. But then, I can't let myself think that, or I will be setting myself up to be hurt again.  After all, I still don't know if he is married, and I do know that he would not have called me at all if Nancy's watchful eye was not two time zones and three thousand miles away.  I must be wary, I cannot get my hopes up, because they WILL get dashed. I have to work on having no expectations.  I have been interviewing for jobs, just in case. I had one last week, for a place called Immersion Technologies.  Their products were somewhere in the middle of a high wow factor (adding the sense of touch to the computer experience) and a "My God, this is the stupidest thing I ever heard."  To top it off, I instantly hated the hiring manager.  I mean at first glance.  She was this stuck-up, standard-Macy's-career-blouse-issued woman with a turned up nose and permanently pursed lips who never smiled and who kept insisting (without a smile) that her job was to help make the computing experience  fun .  I wanted to ask so desperately, "Okay, so now your phone is on buzz mode, and instead of getting one single buzz when it rings, you get two pulses from someone you know. So now you know who you can't talk to at the moment. This is fun....how?"  When she went into virtual slapping matches and tactile emoticons (a heartbeat pulse for "I love you") I almost ended the interview, but when she asked me if I had a typical German personality, that was it. I would not work there if it was the last place on earth. It has "dotcom" written all over it. It reminded me of interviews in 1999 where everyone kept asking me, "Have you seen our game room?" Which of course translated, in 1999 speak, into "You are never leaving this building."  Thank you, NEXT!
