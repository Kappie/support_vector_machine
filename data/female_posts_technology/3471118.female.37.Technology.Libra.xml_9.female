As Christians, we should live our lives in a way that lives up to the expectations God has for us now *because* we are Christians. We should be humble and gentle with each other. We should be patient with each other, and we should show love to each other (which helps us to be humble and gentle and patient).  We should try to keep things peaceful (the learning Bible says, "Keep the unity, which God produced through the reconciling death of Christ. It is the heavy responsibility of Christians to keep that unity from being disturbed."  I don't really understand this, but I think it means to keep the holy spirit close to us, the way it was when it first came to us from Jesus' death. But I really don't know if that's right, it seems very confusing.).  We need to remember that there is one God, one son, one spirit, and one hope - which is in them. There is just one God and Lord and Father and he is everywhere, in everything and in everyone.  This was really a little confusing to me (I don't like Paul's writing very much, it never seems clear to me) but I think it's just basically telling us how we should be interacting with other people now that we are Christians -- with patience and kindness and gentleness and love, upholding the expectations and responsibility that comes with being Christian and setting the example for others.  And do all of this remembering where our hope lies, and that God is in control of everything.  And if that is what the passage is saying, then it's something I know I need to remember, and I hope I'm doing better with that.
