Mine was taken in 1999 and was truly an amazing and remarkable journey.  The Walk to Emmaus is told in the Bible in  Luke 24:13-34  and entails a journey of two people who end up walking with Jesus, unbeknownst to them at the time.   An Emmaus Walk  is further defined in an article as:   "The Emmaus Walk is an exercise in which prayer and scripture run together in a walking meditation. The specific goal of this exercise is for two believers to walk together in fellowship and in silence, allowing the risen Christ to minister within and between them. It begins in a group meeting, providing the context of silence, scripture and prayer, then breaks up into couples for the actual Emmaus Walk, and returns about an hour later to share the experiences of the walk, and to offer it to God in gratitude and praise."   For further descriptions of the Emmaus Walk process, please see the article,  An Emmaus Walk .  Perhaps, the crux of the Emmaus Walk can be summed up in the following two passages from the Bible:    Luke 24:31  (After Jesus explained the passages from the writings of Moses and all the prophets, explaining what all the Scriptures said about himself and broke bread with the travellers:) "Suddenly their eyes were opened, and they recognized him.  And at that moment he disappeared!"   Luke 24:32  "They said to each other, 'Didn't our hearts feel strangely warm as he talked with us on the road and explained the Scriptures to us?' "   When speaking to a friend of mine today about the Walk to Emmaus, she reminded me of this song...from the  Casting Crowns  website:    If We Are The Body  Song based on James 2:1-9     Lyrics by Mark Hall    Music by Casting Crowns  It's crowded in worship today As she slips in trying to fade into the faces The girls teasing laughter is carrying farther than they know Farther than they know  Chorus: But if we are the body Why aren't His arms reaching? Why aren't His hands healing? Why aren't His words teaching? And if we are the body Why aren't His feet going? Why is His love not showing them there is a way? There is a way   I will never ever forget the journey I took in 1999 nor the people I met on that journey.  Their faces are forever engrained in my mind.  Everyone experiences the Walk to Emmaus in a different way; and, when you begin participating in the putting toIf you have strayed away from your beliefs or want to make your faith even stronger, such a walk is certainly recommended (please note:  this walk isn't only for adults, there are Chrysallis walks for the youth, and Genesis walks for pre-teens; their missions are all the same!), for example:    urlLink What is Emmaus?   urlLink Emmaus, Cursillo, Chrysalis, TresDias, Ect   urlLink Mt.

Without my Emmaus Walk in 1999, my Guatemala trip may not have been enhanced so greatly.   I am looking forward to sharing with you more about my Guatemala trip.  Stay posted.
