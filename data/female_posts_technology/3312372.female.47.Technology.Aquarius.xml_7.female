Just had a couple of beers. Less calories :) I stuck to my exercise program also. So I feel pretty good about myself and my new goals to cut the drinking down and to get the pain meds down also. I'm on the road to getting my body back in Hawaii shape!!! I gained about 10-15 pounds after the knee surgery I recently had. I don't look bad I just want to get back to my wardrobe and feel healthier. Well hopefully this will be a good week and I stay focused on my goals. My guy called still just small talk. Oh well I guess that's better than fighting. Nice weekend all and all just to short. Peace :)
