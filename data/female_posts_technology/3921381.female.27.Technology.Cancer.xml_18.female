BAM!!! and there was smoke in the air from the air bags. some idiot rear ended us at a very good speed. i was in the back seat passenger side. my other friend, who wasin the passenger side, and i were both in shock. my friend, the driver, was very upset because this may be like the 5th accident in 2 years, all not her fault, and the second cadillac she's had. she got out of her car and went to bitch out the guy who hit us. his reply to her was, "you stopped in the middle of the street". well, yes, because there was a car infront of us turning. had his idiot ass paid attention, we'd all be fine!  on-star came on. there was also a detective who was around when it happened. he directed traffic so we could move out of the street safely. police man came. took report. took names.  my friend, the driver, got her left thumb smashed. maybe be from the airbag. my other friend had her legs crossed at the time so her impact was harsh. her left leg was bruised. the seat belt squeezed on her during impact. her left hip was hurting along with her back. i felt shock. i had numbness and tingling around my face and all over my body, mostly my hands. i was scared.   the two girls went on the ambulance. i went back to work with a staff, who came over after we called him. i picked up my car and went to my doctor. i started feeling pain on my left side:leg, arm, neck. then there was more pain around my lower head and neck area.6 hrs later and i'm feeling pain along my lower back and shoulders. i made an appointment to see my chiropractor tomorrow.  i had to get the claim # from my friend and i also need her insurance policy. anyhoo, i hope everyone is ok.  now for the twilight zone moment: last year 4 days from today, we all had gotten into an accident with a county car also going to lunch.   as for my friends: as stated previously, the driver--> this is her 5th accident within 2 years the passenger--> this is her 3rd accident of the year.   next time we go to lunch, i'll meet them there.  as for me, i'm hoping this whiplash does not come back every so often to remind me of the today's accident.  thank you God for watching over us so that we can continue to breathe.
