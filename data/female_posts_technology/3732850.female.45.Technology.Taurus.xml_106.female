This essay makes her sound unhappy and exhaused in her role as a mother. She is ironing and what comes to her mind is, "Yeah, why not get or have a wife?" She's thinking of her divorced friend and sees why he wants someone. To take care of his needs and his one child. She almost sounds angry or bitter at the role she plays because I think her duties are unappreciative in her household.  In this case, I'd like a wife too. In reality, it is a fifty-fifty deal to me. Working together, because an income now-a-days takes two people to make it in this world today and with that I would say, "IT TAKES TWO!" to accomplish the routine of everyday life. When both making incomes, there needs to be an agreeable arrangement of working together in the home equally, as partners so transitions can run smoothly as possible.
