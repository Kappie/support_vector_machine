If the world were to suddenly end right now, what do you wish you would have done?  I wished I had told my family and husband that I loved them, that I had sky-dived, gone white-water rafting, visited the countries I wanted to visit.  All the goals I had outlined to accomplish when I was in high school.   2. How many times do you hit the snooze button before getting out of bed?  About 3-4. I'm really, really bad at it.   3. What cartoon do you enjoy watching from the present (or the past)?  I loved Tiny Toons, and now enjoy Dexter's Laboratory and Power Puff girls though I haven't watched any cartoons in a long time (or any TV for that matter).   4. If you could go to any time and/or place in history, where/when would it be?  I've always wanted to go back to the fifties cause of the cool fashion. I really loved the way ladies dressed back then.   5. If your life were a movie, what would it be rated and why?  I'd rate my public life a PG-13, but my life behind closed doors with husband "Restricted" (wink, wink)     Have a Great Weekend Everyone!!
