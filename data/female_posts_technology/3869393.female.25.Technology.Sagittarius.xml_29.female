First, when there's nothing but a slow glowing dream  That your fear seems to hide deep inside your mind  All alone I have cried silent tears full of pride  In a world made of steel, made of stone   Well I hear the music, close my eyes, feel the rhythm  Wrap around, take a hold of my heart   Chorus:  What a feeling, bein's believin' I can't have it all, now I'm dancin' for my life  Take your passion, and make it happen Pictures come alive, you can dance right through your life (Solo)  Now I hear the music, close my eyes,  I am rhythm In a flash it takes hold of my heart   chorus (with ... "now I'm dancing through my life")   What a feeling What a feeling (I am music now),  bein's believin' (I am rhythm now) P ictures come alive, you can dance right through your life  What a feeling (I can really have it all)  What a feeling (Pictures come alive when I call)  I can have it all (I can really have it all) Have it all (Pictures come alive when I call)  (call, call, call, call, what a feeling)I can have it all (Bein's believin')bein's believin'  (Take your passion, make it happen) make it happen  (What a feeling) what a feeling... (to fade) !
