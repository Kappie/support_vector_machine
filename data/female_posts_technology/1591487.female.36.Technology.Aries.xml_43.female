You know, that stumbling around kind of deliriousness, the kind that makes you knock over whole displays of chocolate bars in convenience stores.  Clearly, it was yet another universal sign that I shouldn't not have even veered in the direction of the chocolate bars and just stuck with the bottle of water.  The shop owner was most kind and said not to worry about helping put all the chocolate bars back, but I persisted in helping him anyway while explaining the whole 'it's a sign' business.  His sense of relief when I walked away was palpable.     I think I'm turning into one of those old ladies who accost people at bus stops by beginning conversations in the middle of the story i.e  '...yes, he said that I should keep taking the aspirin for the blood clots' as if you're supposed to know the whole medical history.      Last week was hard rubbish collection week in my suburb. Here are some of the things I saw when I was out walking;  seven ovens (people must go through ovens like tissues in our suburb, this also included our oven, by the way.  There must be a shitload of extreme cooking blasting ovens all over the place in our area)  an enormous metal chest that looked exactly like a treasure chest in a pirate movie, I was almost tempted to open it and would not have been surprised to have been blinded by a great big pile of pieces of eight  a solitary computer monitor perched on the edge of the footpath in one street where there was no other hard rubbish, it looked as if it was waiting to cross the road. Surreal, man.  a huge pile of baby furniture, including a change table, a bath, a pram, a tricycle, a cot.  I'm kind of surprised they kept the actual baby.  a hibachi (so 80s')   Fascinating, really.
