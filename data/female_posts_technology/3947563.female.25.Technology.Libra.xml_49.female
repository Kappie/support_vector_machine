When I got home from baseball Ryan made me eat a handful of popcorn and a homemade muffin. (haha, made.) But I managed to get to the gym for a half an hour, so it's all good.      Friday I forgot to make my lunch, so I ended up having the spinach salad from Wendy's. That one's my favourite. (With low fat dressing, of course.) Then I had some fruit at the meeting. I went to the gym for 30 mins of cardio after work, and ended up doing a few chest exercises and some leg presses. Then some sweaty guy tried to chat me up, so I left. I had a sub for dinner, 12 inch turkey on brown with no cheese, just mustard and veggies, but I also had a bag of sunchips. 250 calories, but except for the cake I'd been good all week.       Today I am going to do some errands, so I'm not sure if I will work out or not. I am feeling good about the weigh-in on Monday. Anyways, off to do groceries and buy a not-so-ugly sweater, much to Sharron's delight I'm sure :P
