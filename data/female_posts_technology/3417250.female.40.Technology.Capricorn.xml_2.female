Wow! (interjection) It is clear to see that these young (adjective) thespians (noun) have worked hard and have had fun doing so.  Ranging in age from 11 to 14, these folks handled the pressure of live performance like many older, more seasoned actors must aspire to do.     We got a special treat in "Interplant Janet" when nine of the teachers as well as the school principal played the parts of the solar system.  The crowd loved it.  I mean, they ate it up!  Principal Taggert especially will always have a backup career on the stage should he ever tire of principaling.      For many of the parents watching, the show was a trip down memory lane.  During a few  songs, I could almost see the cartoon that went with the song in the TV version.  For you young readers, this was back when cartoons were pretty much a Saturday morning thing; lacking the 24/7 availability like it is now.  This means that we took our Saturday morning cartoons seriously.  Astute parents used this fact to their late-sleeping advantage.  As long as we kept quiet and didn't wake the parental units, we could have the ONLY TV IN THE HOUSE to ourselves for one glorious morning.  That glorious morning always included Schoolhouse Rock. Tonight's production took us back to that place.  Thank you and congratulations Ms. Hornsby on a job well done!  Kudos!  Of special note in the performance were Kelly Ferguson (chorus) Caitlin Doucet (chorus and dancer).  It was only by virtue of her smoldering, molasses voice that Ashley Johnson was even noticed by the crowd, so brightly did Kelly and Caitlin shine!
