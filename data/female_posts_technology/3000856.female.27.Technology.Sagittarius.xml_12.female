I got something in my eye yesterday at work and me like a dummy kept rubbing my eye instead of taking out my contact.  One of the dr's finally told me how irritated it looked and to take the contact out and flush out my eye. Anyway, because I kept rubbing it I scratched my cornea.  I can barely open it and it is so sensitive to light.  Dr said it should be better in a few days.  I can't stand it anymore.  I am ready to gouge it out w/ a fork! LOL I know pretty boring stuff to read! Sorry I will make it more exciting soon.
