"someone's unfriendly today... give us a pretty smile, grace!" i just kept on walking... and then i heard them whisper something about pmsing.       why can't i just be a fucking bitch without having it covered up by some excuse like pms? i can be moody  whenever  the fuck i wanna be. that's my god-given right as a woman. if i don't feel like saying hi to you,  i don't have to . and if i do, then it's your fucking lucky day, isn't it? maybe they should take a hint and just NOT say hi to me. there's NO reason to talk to me about what i did this past weekend or if steve and i are planning on having kids... it's   NONE OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS  . could i make it any more clear?      i hate people so much i took the extra chair out of my cube so they couldn't sit and chat. as soon as i'm done ranting, i'm taking down all pics in my cubes so they can stop using them as conversation pieces. it's not that i have a lot of friends or anything, we could all use friends. i just don't want  them  as my friends. i'd rather have no friends than have these stupid work people as my friends.
