Could it be that the melody is more soulful, or the words begin flow when pen meets paper, the feet move more rhythmically, the brush stokes become more fluid...Could it be that one tends to channelise all the sorrow in one direction...The medium becomes a vent to all emotions built up inside.....   Well, in some cases i have experienced that when i'm feeling a lil out of sorts and down..i tend to concentrate better ...be it on studies, or the work at hand...When all else seems hopeless, do all energies tend to be focussed more towards the job on hand??   Is there a connection?
