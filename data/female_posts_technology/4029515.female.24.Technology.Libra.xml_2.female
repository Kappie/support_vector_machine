The most hilarious part of the movie(what?it's isn't a comedy??) was when good ol' "Mr.President" spends hours on the phone chatting with his wife or some such thing and gets himself killed trying to get out in the last minute.How duh is that??!  Real sorry if I'm ruining it for some of you who might have not watched it btw...(the pleasure is all mine..:D)  Nevertheless I enjoyed the eye candy(Jake Gyllenhaal)..Mmmm...
