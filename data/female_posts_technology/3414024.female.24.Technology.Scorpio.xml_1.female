I have no idea how it's prepared, but I wouldn't mind adding it to my diet to spice things up a bit. :o) I've noticed a few small things about my over all behavior that changed since last week. I'm no longer in a hurry to do nothing. Meaning that when I go home, I don't feel the need to "veg out" , and instead try to spend my time either riding my bike, cleaning months of disorder or strengthening relationships. I spent some time cleaning up and rearranging the furniture in my room last night. I think that once it's finished I'll be rather pleased.  I took the long way to the grocery store last night to pick up some more food. Menu: (last night) celery (2 stalks) peach (one rather squished from being stuffed in my backpack) milk from a young coconut   Breakfast: 3 cherry tomatoes,  1 stalk of celery,  5 snap beans 7 baby carrots and of course my green tea.
