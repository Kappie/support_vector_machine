Last time I  got a haircut I was like so why'd you move back and he said, "Well, all I was doing in San Francisco was watching TV, doing drugs, then going to work." I opened my eyes wide and said mock-aghast, "You mean... you cut my hair... ON DRUGS?" and he waved his hand dismissively and said, "Oh yeah! All the time!" and I lisped solemnly, "No wonder it was so... INSPIRED."  I knew it was love at first appointment because the first time he washed my hair he was going on and on about a movie starring Carol Channing and Gwyneth Paltrow. He described it as dark and about two women in a corporate environment, one a top exec and one just starting out. He goes on and on, and it sounds familiar to me... I've seen this movie, but I'm not seeing Carol Channing in the role as the high power executive. I interrupted him and said, by Carol Channing, don't you mean  Stockard  Channing? And he stops for a minute and goes, "Yeah, right, Stockard Channing," and continues to describe the movie and how much he loved Gwyneth Paltrow in it. And I think a little more, and the  urlLink movie  is coming back to me and I say, "Hey, that wasn't Gwyneth Paltrow... that was Julia STILES." And he laughs some more, and goes, "Was it?"   "Anyway, I loved that movie."  My last haircut was 2 months ago when Abby and I made the pilgrimage all the way to  urlLink San Jose  for our fab 'dos. They cost us $70 each, tip included. For two months, that's less than $1 a day for awesome hair.  I'm feelin pretty shaggy these days, but $70 pinches my wallet. But for a haircut, an hour of celebrity gossip, Courtney Love impersonations, stories of his family life and his road to sobriety ("I"ll eat a whole dinner at home then drive straight to McDonald's and get a Quarter Pounder!"), and just the sight of his get-ups* alone are absolutely, fabulously priceless.  *He once wore an intricate necklace that looked like a gothic fishnet/chandelier draped across his chest. It was worn over a black t-shirt.
