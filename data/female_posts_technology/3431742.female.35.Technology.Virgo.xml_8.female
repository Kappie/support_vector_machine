Many might not think that is too bad since I normally leave at 6p; however, I started at 730 today.  Yeah.  Too many hours at work.  No planet for me this Friday.  Maybe next after a few hrs at Summerfest.  Next Tues - 6/22 - It will be budget movie night.  Feature that I'll be watching - Hidalgo.  Gotta see that hot, sexy Viggo. :D ;)  Night all and have a great weekend.
