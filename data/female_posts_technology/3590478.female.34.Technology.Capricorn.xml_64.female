They’d try to make sure you see them ordering baked beans for breakfast, and do their best to mention your apartment so they can call it a ‘flat’. Here’s something else newly cosmopolitan people do after they get back from their trip: if you give them a chance to talk, they’ll relate any event or detail to the country they visited no matter how boring or unmentionable it is. For example, they might interrupt your cocktail party to say, “These olives are dark green. When I was in France, the olives were a much different color. I remember I ate an olive when I was riding the lift over there.” And if you’re honest, you might say back, “you seem different after your trip…ever since you got back, it’s like…it’s like  Europe gave you autism. ” I quoted this from a web site I found recently (I’ll give you the link in a minute) because it sadly and completely describes me. God, for a whole year I’ve been annoying in an eye rolling, shoulder clinching, comma inducing way. What was I thinking?! That I was endearing and entertaining? (well, yeah) And yet you all continued to spend time with me never running from the narcissistic dullard. Or striking me even. I remember in this one episode of friends Monica and Phoebe had this friend who’d spent a year in London then she came back and was driving them nuts with her fake accent and hoity toity affected European ways. It was hilarious but only because it was TV and the friend was played by Jennifer Coolidge and it only lasted 22 minutes. Not so funny in real life is it? So kudos to all of you for putting up with me and I promise to cut it out. But I’m still allowed to write about it. And I’m not giving up the fruity obscenities. Although to give credit most of them came from Mil Millington and from Spike, a character only pretending to be English.    I found the site on my soap opera message board. Link removed* And I have  yet another  hero. In depth smarty pants dissertations of the super friends and their archenemies. My favorite was the one about bizarro superman from the legion of doom. Thanks all my children message boarders and writers of Sealab 2021 for being such hugely clever geeks!
