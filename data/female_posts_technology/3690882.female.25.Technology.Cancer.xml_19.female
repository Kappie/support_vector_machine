(The "Three Philosophers" Belgian beer was excellent - I think we found it at the grocery store on 8th near 23rd.) I am drunk enough that iambic tetrameter seems like a fine transport mechanism for tonight's entry.    I stood on the apartment roof And watched the world  urlLink implode  in light Some drunken Irish serenade As I absorb the sounds of night  Some helicopters fly above I wonder if they see us there Or, if we are just ants to them Up in the sky without a care  The sound rips through the ashen sky It fills me with a sense of pride As fireworks of red white and blue Illuminate the riverside  It reminds me that I'm lucky To celebrate with friends and beer So even if we're still at war At least the bombs aren't falling here.
