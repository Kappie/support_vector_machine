Fun except for the fact that early on in the evening I had some guy decide that I'm the most interesting, beautiful, intelligent, funny woman on the face of the earth and he wouldn't leave my side all night.  Literally.  And he got to be incredibly annoying.  I'm not saying he was wrong ;), but he didn't seem to think that my opinion of him mattered in the equation.  We'll take care of that the next time (if there is a next time) I see him.  He thinks we have a date in August and will be waiting for me.  Somehow, I donâ€™t doubt that.  Anyway, back on track.  Peach had a good day - she even got to take the afternoon off!  And after taking care of her errands and such, she checked her child (the furry four-legged type) into a doggy hotel and came to E and we got our own hotel room.  Knowing the only thing you have to drive home is an elevator can make for a crazy night.  Not stupid-crazy, like when one is in her twenties, but fun enough.  There were no shots or shooters or anything that would cause unnecessary pain and suffering the next day, but I managed to move quickly from beer to cider to wine to white Russians (dessert) without thinking twice.    And after a few helpings of dessert, Peach grabbed her balloons and we made it to the elevator and safely drove to the fifth floor.  I just hate that I left without getting my complimentary breakfast. We'll have to do it again in May!
