My boss has accompanied me in my last business trip and observed me interacting with  prospects. He gave me three notes of criticism:   1) Use the term "Back Office" instead of "Back End". Ok, this is not too bad - I think. I can do that. It's not a critical comment. Doesn't mean I am not doing a good job. Fine.   2) I use "Very" too much. "Very", "Many", "Extremely", "Substantially", and other superlatives of this sort. This comment hit closer to heart. Perhaps, in my eagerness to push our product, to prove my belief, to convince.... or maybe my lack of English skills. Still, this comment points to a problem that is closer to being a character flaw than a technicality. Fine.   3) I shouldn't be so friendly, tell silly stories, put myself down, call myself "stupid".  To put things in perspective, I certainly do not put myself down or think I am stupid (If you are a frequent reader of my blog, you already know this). However, at an informal lunch today I did tell stories of my adventures on Ebay and how I fell for a silly scam, and perhaps I used the word stupid. I thought I was being charming. I had everyone at the table (20 people) captivated, listening, laughing at my punchlines. Was it improper? Should I have been more conscious of my professional image. Perhaps... In Hebrew, this is called "Fason". That's what he said I should have. Ouch... This one is not a technical comment. It is not something I can easily fix. It is my character. And my boss disapproved of it.   Take it as constructive critism - I tell myself. And still...
