I can get used to this... surf the web, talk on the phone, no hiding my screen from anyone.... privacy. LOVE it..... Year 2- Share happy office with 1 other "happy employee" This isn't too bad.... She is cool... I can still chat, browse, and talk on the phone.... I just cant get too indepth when it comes to personal calls.... what would she think if she over heard?! Year 3- Partition life..... Sharing 1 large room with many boys, and 1 other girl.... with only partitions to muffle the sounds of IM beeps, and phone calls.... OMG did he REALLY just tell his wife THAT? punk.... and what the HELL are you eating?? im going to barf! Year 4- Cube life.... no personal phone calls... anything that requires more than a yes, no, or maybe in the conversation is out of the question. ewwwww WHAT did you eat lastnight? cause you be STANKIN! fights for 1 tiny bathroom, and hide your computer screen at all costs.... 1 thing I HAVE to say about cube life ( as Kim puts it) is that we have ALL grown to use our sense of hearing... I can now hear approaching footsteps a GOOD 2 cubes away.... Im getting better at it!  1 last thing.... WHY OH WHY must we have 3-8 meetings a week?? they are 2 hours of WASTED time.... you guys can go have the meetings, ill stay here at my desk and try to remember what it was like to have a office the same size all to myself.... and not share it with 3 other people! maybe I can fake the Flu, and everyone will want to stay away from me?? naaaahhh.... they would all flock to me so they TOO can have just 1 day of home time, and not cube life!
