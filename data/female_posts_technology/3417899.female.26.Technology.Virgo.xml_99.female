       
      Wake up every morning. Brush your teeth, paint your face on.  Walk into the office, greet your coworkers brightly and cheerfully: "G'morning!" Have a cup of coffee or tea, catch up on email, make a few calls.  Type type type. Talk talk talk.  Go to lunch.  Chat about last night's episode on TV... bla bla bla. yada yada yada.  Drive home.  Eat. Sleep. Repeat.    Only rarely does one feel truly alive.  It's that moment of clarity when routine is broken and emotion is awakened.  Be it breaking the rule, or crossing a line, or making one hurt, or drown in pleasure. It's those moments of insanity that truly keep me sane.
