For those that saw them on Warped, the track is called "Blindman's Holiday," and they played it every day. It's fucking awesome. It will be an instant hit with fans of the whole Letter Kills/Foo Fighters-type sound. Also, if you haven't already, add Lobster to your friends list. Once you've done all that you can slip over to  purevolume.com/asmallvictory  to check out another ASV track called "Random Celebration."
