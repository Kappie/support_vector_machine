Those who know me well, will understand why this site has such an appeal for me. My fascination with language, my background, etc... I was instantly captivated.  The more I played around with it, the more interesting items I discovered.   Remember  urlLink my post from a long time ago , where my boss had complained I use the word "very" and "many" too much? Well "very" is ranked at 84 (out of 86800) and "many" is ranked as 108. Both pretty high up - so I guess I am within the normal allowed usage of them both.   Remember  urlLink my post on trying to learn power words ?  urlLink SteveR  had suggested "taxonomy" in his comment. This word is ranked at 25048... Certainly a great word (assuming the less a word is used, the more impressive it can be).   "Love" ranked at 384 while "hate" ranked at 3107 - what a positive reflection on the English language.   "I" is 11 ("you" is 14), "My" is 69 ("your" is 73) - tells us something about priorities.    "Yes"  is 146 but is closely followed by "however" at 147, for safety's sake . And " no " beats them both at 51.
