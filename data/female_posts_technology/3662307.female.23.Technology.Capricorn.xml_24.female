I used to wonder why some things that are not meant to be happened. Things that made us sad and happy at the same time. Things that gives us pleasure and guilt at another time. It's really hard to understand but all things happened for a reason. It makes us grow stronger and more mature. Good or bad, it's how we think of it. It's how we analyse it. So, occasionally, you might be sadden by it but hey...it's in the past....
