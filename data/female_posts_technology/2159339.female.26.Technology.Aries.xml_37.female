I don't do stiches in time: I wait until I'm about to get fired, then I do nine. Then I burn out. Then I slump down and fantasize about XX coming into the file room and we turn off the flourescent lights and kiss in the dark between the rows of file cabinets...  In reality, we haven't interacted once today. Every evening I cross my fingers that he'll come up to me and offer me another ride home like he did last last Monday. And everyday I lock the door, and turn off the lights, and leave the office by myself.    God, this is so emo, I'm going to stab myself in the chest.
