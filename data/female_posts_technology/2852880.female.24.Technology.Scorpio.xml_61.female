They range in age from 19 to 24 and they are from the following countries: Kenya, Turkey, India, Italy, South Africa, Slovenia, Canada, Australia, US, New Zealand, Norway, Argentina, UK, and Japan.  They were recruited from an organization called TakingItGlobal ( urlLink www.takingitglobal.org ) and I have been completely wowed.  I am so grateful to have participated in discussions with this group.  Listening intently, I have learned so much about what is going on outside of the US, what people care about, what people need, and our global challenges moving forward.  I'm inspired to become more internationally involved myself.  As a relatively rich American, I feel somewhat guilty for my lack of global involvement, but I also feel empowered.  We are so lucky that we have the freedom to voice our opinions and our access to influential people.  I'm looking forward to the last two days of the week.  I've already learned so much, yet there are still plenty of issues to discuss.
