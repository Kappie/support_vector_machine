I am pissed but then even more pissed that he picks up the phone and strarts talking. I was ready to get enraged and start yelling but then I looked at my wrist and saw the bracelet that says "WWJD" or what would Jesus do. So I calmed down and did what He would do. I set the guy on fire and sent him to hell.  // posted by Scott @ 11/21/2003 09:29:20 PM
