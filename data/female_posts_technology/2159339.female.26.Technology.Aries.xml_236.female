If that fucker gives me a mini-Eiffel Tower, then I'm going to turn off all feeling for him. A mini-Eiffel Tower isn't a present that a lover gives--it's reserved for friends and family. My confidantes tell me that I can do better than XX/Fucko, but what if I just want to make out with someone  now ? This is the eternal dilemma. But to put my life in perspective, what would I rather have, immediate gratification or something better in the long run? Something better in the long run, I guess. Someone special who doesn't come home from Europe and present me with a mini-Eiffel Tower. If I get this mini-monument, I'll be disappointed, because there's nothing special about it--it's a common cheap trinket found all over Paris--and thus, it'll mean that there's nothing special between me and XX.   Details to come regarding the results of... THE PRESENT TEST.
