He is so very scientific, analytical, unbiased, open-minded and intelligent and, I'm sorry, but I find all of it very sexy.  I'm now only on the 2nd season DVD, disc 4, and last night, we watched the episode where the very introverted Grissom sends Sara Sidell plant (instead of flowers) to convince her not to leave CSI.  And the next episode has Grissom alluding to beauty related to Sara.  I find it all so very exciting, so-for lack of a better word- kilig *  !  Does this make me crazy?!  Husband finds it weird that Sara is so young and he calls Grissom, a dork.  I disagree.  I can't find a better fit for Grissom than Sara and at this day and age, it is trite but true to say that age doesn't matter.  I cannot believe my favorite romantic couple in television is a couple who are not even that romantic but rather, very scientific.  And a disclaimer...I have not been watching the show as it currently airs.  I will wait to progress watching through my Netflix DVDs.  ***    Happy Mother's Day to all the mothers out there! I salute you all!      * this is a Tagalog word that roughly translates to exciting in a romantic way...there's no adequate English word translation for it.
