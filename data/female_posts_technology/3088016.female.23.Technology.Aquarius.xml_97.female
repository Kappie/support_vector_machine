On June 14th (a week ago yesterday), Wayne and I celebrated our two year dating anniversary.  A lot of people tell me that they didn't do this, but I think it's important.  Whether you're married or not, it's always good to show in a relationship that you're happy to still be there.  That's definitely the case for me; it's been a great two years.   We marked the occasion by dining at the place where we met, La Vista on Fountainview.  It's hard to explain the appeal of a place where people will bring their own wine and drink it while waiting in the parking lot for a table, but this little sidewalk cafe has its own unique personality.  We did bring the "good wine," for what it's worth.  Later we watched a rented movie and fell asleep on the couch.    In the Wayne-and-Cynthia gift giving tradition, we made up wish lists for the other person to pick from for gifts.  I had quite a time picking out Wayne's barbecue grill, going to several different stores before finally selecting one that wasn't even on his list, the  urlLink Aussie Bushman Elite .  We've cooked on it several times, and I must say, it's pretty nice.  I haven't quite mastered making the food come out perfectly, but we're getting there.   What he got me was also cool.  I had put three MP3 players on my list, and the one he found -  urlLink Samsung 'yepp  - was cute and tiny.  I was happy that he picked it instead of the jewelry I had asked for that wouldn't really be very nice in our price range.  (Wayne, if you're reading this, it's not an endorsement for electronics over jewelry every time.  I just want to make that clear.)   urlLink     urlLink     On Sunday night, I got a bit agitated with the player because I couldn't get files onto it.  The error message just read "g".  What am I supposed to tell from that?  The next dialog box would reboot my machine if I hit yes, which I accidentally did several times.  It was frustrating.  It didn't dawn on me until tonight that I was writing to the wrong drive entirely.  To my credit, it doesn't show up in Windows Explorer unless I just try the F:\ drive.  Now that I can get music onto it, I like the device even better.    It's funny; I write code at work for plant equipment symbols with complex mathematical logic and scripts that can move directory trees, but something like this can still have me stumped for two days.
