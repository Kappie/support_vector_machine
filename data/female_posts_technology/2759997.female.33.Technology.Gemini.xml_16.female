Therefore you might just go through them like a house afire, wanting to clear out as much clutter as you can. This is always good, as a cluttered house parallels a cluttered mind. However, make certain you at least scan something before discarding it. You don't want to throw something out you may need later. How appropriate...  That's what I have planned for the weekend.
