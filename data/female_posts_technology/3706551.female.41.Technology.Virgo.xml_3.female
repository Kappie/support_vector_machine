They started in California in April of 2002 and are now in South Africa ... they plan to cycle back to the U.S. via Antarctica  South America.  They keep an online journal of their adventures, and boy they've had some gnarly ones!  Would you like to read about them? Then click  urlLink here  silly!!  I have some biking adventures of my own planned.  Across Great Britain is one of them.  I would also like to bike around New Zealand.  For now, I will read the stories of my adventurous friends.  Take a look!!
