I was surprised that I only saw one other person running.  There were a few early morning commuters waiting at streetcar stops and coffee shops.    I’m trying to be healthier, and sleep is an important part of health.  I strive to go to sleep around 10pm and wake at 6am on days I want to run (10:30-6:30 on off days.)  Sometimes I find it hard to turn my brain off and I lie in bed thinking.  On top of that, I live on a busy street and my apartment is a few floors up, right on the street.  There are streetcars until the wee hours and garbage pick up twice a week around midnight.  I can’t always hear the television if a streetcar goes by, so I’ve learned to watch it with the closed captioning on.
