Why can't he see the show and they sold him the tickets knowing that he was in a wheelchair, so they should of told him then that they had a policy for disabled patrons. I feel that any one that pays for a show or movie should be accessible for the handicapped.   They are as equal as we are that are not handicap. I know now there are places that are pretty much equipped for the handicap. In Montana were I used to live, there was this lady that would go around places to see if they were accessible and then she would get a petition going so that they would make it accessible to any one.
