Tammy at Sleepy Hollow Tattoo did a kick ass job. if anybody is interested in seeing some of Sleepy Hollow's stuff, there new web site is http://www.sleepyhollowtattoo.8m.com/. they are located in milford, ct and they rock!   harry survived his first sitting on saturday like a trooper. brandon couldn't finish cuz he started bleeding, so he's coming back with me to get it all done. he's not sure if he'll get another one, but he likes the one he's got. the detail is amazing. i will have to post a pic of his once it's done.   nothing has been going on so i haven't really had anything to write about. i will say that harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban was amazing. very dark and sinister. did the book justice. possibly a little bit too scary for any child under the age of 10. gary oldman is the shit! he is one of the most versatile actors around nowadays. the kids are growing up. Rupert is such a little cutie. his hair's all long and wild now. i'm sure he's already a little heartbreaker. i'm wondering when the next book is coming out.  the newest installment of Stephen King's Dark Tower series is coming out...i think today. i gotta check and see so i can order.   i just reread mark waid and alex ross's kingdom come. if you have never read this graphic novel, go out and get it. the story is fantastic and i can't even begin to tell you about alex ross's artwork. it's like no other i have ever seen. you can't even begin to put it into words. people were once blown away by thomas blake's lithograph pieces. people of today are blown away by ross's work in the same manner. it's a whole new level of comic book art. there was also a novel put out by mark waid that really went into all the details of the story. i would also recommend that.   i could write about books all day, but alas i must be off to work soon. i will write more later.
