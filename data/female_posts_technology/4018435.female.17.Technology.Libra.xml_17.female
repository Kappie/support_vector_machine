We were at chapters for a bit checking out really kool art books and language guides. We stoppe by canadian tire and picked up new pedals and a shift handle for his car. Pretty spiffy stuff i say. I payed him back the cash i owed him and I still gott pay mom back for my hair cut...damn...i need money.              Man I'm tired...to be honest...I think this journal entry is gonna b really short.              I met up with josh tonight after his work. It was really great to see him. He's so cute. He's really interested in cars and we talked a bit about video games. Mostly cars. We couldn't meet up tomorrow night since it was his mom's b'day party. I'll most likely see him on sunday night. I hope i get back from toronto on time that night!              My room is slowly being taken apart...My schedule has been a bit messed up at the moment...yep...lotsa weird stuff going on in my life...Kevin asked me to hang out with him tonight sumwhere far but I couldn't go out that far...i wouldn't be allowed to at the moment.              Omg...I'm really falling asleep... Gotta go to bed. My ribs hurt from last night when tom picked me up from my ribs to pull me outside....i didn't feel the pain till this morning...
