I am talking about none other than CAT! What enrages me most currently is the ease with which people who have been given the power to conduct an exam for an admission to an educational institution behave like mere sadistic wolves…waiting to cause hurt and anguish to innocent people across. I and my sister had been preparing for CAT for almost a year, desperate to get an admission in one of the most prestigious business schools with the hope of a promising future; we had been waiting for this exam. First came the shock of the exam being cancelled and the re-test being announced. Lakhs of students like us budged to it and had no choice but to give their next best shot on Feb 15’Th. Finally the day arrives and we wake up from sweet slumber on a wintry day, taking efforts to get ready for the exam. The anticipation and anxiety surfaces, but there is a hope that somewhere in a few months we would be in a business school. We say to each other we can make it and get set to go! All set, the reporting time is 10.30 on the hall ticket. Not more than a 10 mins drive from our home, we decide to be independent on our bike on a Sunday sharp at 10am. With least similarity in our names, mine was Christ Degree College and hers Mount Carmel as our centers of examination. The fate started playing games beginning with our bike breaking down due to the engine being cold; we decided to park it at a departmental store in the locality and board two different auto-rickshaws. It was 10.15 already. The rickshaw could not go beyond a speed of 30kmph and to my bad luck; the route was blocked completely due to the flyover construction happening at Dairy circle. I had no choice but to take a roundabout behind Nimhans and reach Christ College. I hadn’t reached yet, it was 10.32 am….still on my way. My cell rings, I pick it up to answer my famished sister on the other side , telling me with enormous pain and panic that the Professors in Mount Carmel College are not letting her sit through to the exam, although she was there at sharp 10.32…two mins late to the reporting time. What the heck!!!!!!! I mean TWO MINS IS NO BIG DEAL TO NOT LET SOMEBODY WRITE THE EXAM THAT EVERYBODY HAS BEEN WAITING FOR ……So INHUMANE!!!!!! To add to the anguish I reach my center Christ College ten minutes late and the people out there were appreciably courteous and concerned. I couldn’t believe that the professor took me to the hall, gave me water and asked me to stop panicking…That is what you call understanding and humanity. I called my sister again and inform her that I was allowed for the exam. We are twins, have been studying together in school, have been doing things together and are probably more attached to each other than other siblings……Have been dreaming to get into the same college after a gap of studying separately for six years. What brings anger and tears in my eyes is that, she didn’t expect IIM’s but had been eager to get into SP Jain and other colleges. Having no maths-background since 10’th she didn’t hope much, but had hopes of getting into some good business school for her MBA. She worked hard; she was always punctual…and never erred in life in terms of her career and academics. How can somebody deny her the right to write an exam just because she was just a couple of mins late to the reporting time? The exam started at 11am, and with sadness gripping her she withdrew the struggle and came back and didn’t get back home in an effort to vent out what she felt like. No one but her knew what she was going through. My exam was a waste of all the effort put in a whole year with the least concentration I could muster. I had to, but sit and give my exam with no choice. This has left such a bitter aftertaste. Had people in Mount Carmel College been more sensitive and more humane towards such genuine cases, things would have been different and would have made a big difference in a life of another young aspiring girl!
