But, even more important is the fact that I have already found so many ways that it can help me at work. Windows Journal has already proven to be an incredibly useful tool. I am a list maker. I know that's not hard for any of you who actually know me to believe.   But I can write my lists in journal and edit and update and reorder, and it keeps up with me. And the handwriting recognition is amazing. Even when I scribble - which I have been known to do - And I happen to be doing now. This post is being written in Word with the Tablet PC Input Panel in Writing Pad mode.   So, the next time I meet with a department to discuss new development on the website or building out any of our other software products, I won't be using a whiteboard or using an easel and giant post-it notes. I'll hook this baby up to a projector and save our notes and immediately send an email with the outline of what we need to build.   And as I was thinking about how much this new toy is going to help me, I realized I still have 2 other toys still in their respective boxes that I can now play with, since my project from hell is over...  Coming soon... my reviews of TiVo and XM radio.  :)
