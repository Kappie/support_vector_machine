Also because it makes me feel superior.  All good reasons, don't you think?  Not that I feel the need to justify my television viewing habits to anyone, but it seems that some seem to cast aspersions on those who do indulge in trash TV.  Oh, cast away then I say.  I love it.   Also, I feel it brings people together.  Making sure you regularly view at least one reality television show allows you to converse with a myriad of people from hairdressers, people in shops and the canteen lady.  And even, once in a while, with my own colleagues. I won't go into the weirdness just yet, of the dilemma that is conversing with my various workmates, that's for another time.  Reality TV - it's the new social lubricant.  Try it sometime.
