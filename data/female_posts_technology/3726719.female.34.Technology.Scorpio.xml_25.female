Yep - the little rascals, started the call for food.  Ugh.   Roomie and I both ended up waking up - he went for coffee and I started some breakfast.  Roomie being hung over like he was (is it any wonder with all those pina coladas) ended up crashing on the couch.  I curled up in my room for a bit.   My plan was to get to the boat dock for the day at the lake outing with the work gang by 10:30.  I got up at 10:30.  :D   Still made it there by 11:30 with a stop at Walmart for chips on the way.  Boy is hanging out at the lake a life I could stand.   It was an absolutely perfect day.  Weather more like September than the middle of August.   It was fantastic.  Top it off with a hamburger cooked on the grill, and there really isn't anything better.  I didn't leave until about 4:30.  Of course I could have taken a nap starting around 2:30.  Didn't though.   Got home to get ready for my date to meet Mr. S.  He was cool and let me push the time back 30 minutes.  We met at Cinco de Mayo.  Surprisingly enough, I didn't fall asleep after my first margarita.  As tired as I was, that was surprising.  It helped that Mr. S was talkative.  Cute, entertaining guy.  It wasn't until about an hour in to the date that his conversation got a little bizarre for me.  He is obviously anti-government, which seems a tad strange for an ex-Marine (although that could be the reason).   He's got some pretty out-there philosophies on things.  I got a few good chuckles.  Didn't say much.  There are some people you can't argue or talk reason with.  I'm not sure we'll being seeing each other again.   All in all it was a good weekend.  I have to say I like a little bit more lazy in them though.  :D
