In the past few days we've seen Fiddler on the Roof, The Producers and Paul Mooney Live.  We've visited the World Trade Center site, Grand Central, Central Park (on foot, bike and horse drawn carriage), Battery Park, The Empire State Building and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  We've eaten at more than a dozen restaurants that even Lexi and I haven't visited yet.  All in all I think we had a great time, considering that we had to put up with some thunderstorms.    It's a little hard to process everything and I even skipped editing today to relax after all that activity.  These last few days have shown me that there are some huge discrepancies in how hard it is to do some of the touristy things in NY.  Visiting the WTC site: free, quick and easy.  Visiting the Empire State Building's observation deck: a 2 hour wait on a Monday afternoon with exorbitant ticket fees.  Horse Drawn Carriage ride: $50 and there's always one around the south end of the park.   Broadway shows: varies.  We bought Fiddler tickets 4 hours before showtime with no trouble.  However the Lion King had a 3 week wait for any reasonably priced seats.    One experience I definitely suggest is to see a movie at the AMC 25 in Time Square.  It's a huge glass building and you can chill on the top floor of the theater, soaking in time square for the cost of a movie ticket.  They even have the new ticket dispensers that let you buy a ticket by credit card without waiting in line.  Given Manhattan prices and the lack of soda refills, it's pretty cost effective to chill with a huge diet coke on the top floor and just watch the pageant of tourists, street vendors and natives all flow by.    Gotta go to dinner.  I'll write more about the shows and such later.
