I am going to be a new auntie...to baby twins  - Hailey and Elijah from my little brother and his wife Jen, and also a new sister to an unborn sibling from my dad and his wife Amy. Can you believe that??? - I will be at least 26 years older than my new sibling. WOW! My mom and Johnny bought a beautiful house in Bakersfield, CA. And they have two cute little rat terrier dogs. Brandon just moved back up to Portland and started a new job. Then there's me, in less than a week I will be in Bangalore, India! What in the world will I be doing there??? Have I ever been there? No. Do I know anyone there? No. Oh well...I hope the food will be good. More later....But congratulations to everyone's new beginning!
