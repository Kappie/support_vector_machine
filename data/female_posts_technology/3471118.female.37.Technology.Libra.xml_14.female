He will dwell in the parched places of the desert, in a salt land where no one lives.  7 'But blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, whose confidence is in him. 8 He will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green. It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit.'   Don't try to get through life on your own, putting your trust in your own abilities or things in the world around you. You won't be very successful and will have a lot of adversity to deal with as a result.  Put your trust in God and trust him to help you through your life.  He will not only help you but will make you successful and prosperous.  You'll be able to live without any fear, knowing that he's going to be taking care of you.  Like the previous reading, this is just a good thing for me to remember in general. Putting my trust in anyone isn't the easiest thing to do and the fact that it's God doesn't make it much better, although I know it should.  I am doing better about it, but keeping this in mind will help a lot with that.
