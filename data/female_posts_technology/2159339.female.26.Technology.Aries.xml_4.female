Because my cigar broke on the bus and i haven't had a chance to get a new one and someone just mistook my costume for 'a russian'. I'm Fidel, god damn it! Can't you see the Cuban flag on my pocket?? Arg.  Oh, and batty, i'm sorry i missed the seven oh seven. I hit the snooze twice this morning and lagged in a big way. But! I discovered that there is TONS of parking in my hood on weekday mornings. Good to know for next time I sleep over at my imaginary boyfriend's imaginary house and have to drive back home in the morning.   But back to workfools not dressing up when they said they would - WEAKSAUCE!!
