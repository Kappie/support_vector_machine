You really can't have it all... Life is always about trade-offs...  I had money but I had no life.... Now, I am about to get my life back, but then I have to accept that I won't be able to go on weekly shopping sprees anymore like before.  Life is also about choices... I made a choice 4 years ago to pursue the ultimate corporate values of money, power and prestige. Now, I'm making a choice to walk away from the chance of having it all for reasons I alone will understand.  If growing up in this industry means becoming cynical and jaded about life, no thank you. They can keep the money.  If becoming sucessful means having to step on others and clawing my way to the top of the pile of shit everyone leaves behind, no thank you. I'd rather spend my life being an average person with peace in my heart.  I've made my choice. For better or for worse, I am going to live with it.  Besides, happiness, perfection and success is not only found in making your first million before you're 30.  Some of us find it in helping others.  Some of us find it in being good at a craft.  Some of us find it in having the time to appreciate the beauty of life.  If people think I am crazy so be it... I tried and I have no regrets taking this path.  Lest I get misunderstood, I don't think corporations are evil. I don't look down on regular 8-5 jobs. I am just turning away from a career path that was taking my time away from everything I hold dear and changing me into a person I was not.  Everything changes on Sept. 1, 2004.
