They walked to a market, bought some beer and returned to the jail to share it with other prisoners. When the booze ran out, the other two inmates made another beer run to a different store."  OMG!  I laughed SO hard when I read this article.  These guys broke out wearing street clothes, as the prison cannot afford jumpsuits for everyone.  I don't really think it's fair to charge them for escape.  I mean, come on, it was the prison's fault for leaving the doors unlocked.  They DID come back, after all!  They didn't even cause a riot!  These guys just wanted a beer.  I can't blame them; if I were locked up in prison, I think I'd want alcohol too!
