It started with my caterer at V urlLink ienna Bakery  telling me he couldn't understand my secrecy about the event, it's all over the Internet that there is to be  urlLink an acquisition of Force by Motorola.  I told him, "look, it's okay if the Internet tells you, but if I tell you, I'm sharing a jail cell with Martha Stewart!"  Next thing you know I'm buying platters and doilies and balloon arches and renting big platters and samovars and pushing really hard to get checks written (Motorola is on Oracle and Force is on SAP and they don't have compatible cost center numbers, but everyone is really good at passing the buck around here.) This is especially easy since we discovered that at the moment, nobody actually has a boss.  Meanwhile my sister Nancy, who caused so much grief over the years to my family, keeps a blog here too. I follow it once in awhile because it is usually so damned funny. She may be a heartless bitch when it comes to the family (she refuses to meet Jacob, for example, because she "doesn't feel ready to be an Aunt") but she's a good writer. Her entry introduced me to one of the  urlLink funniest websites  I've seen in years, and I was up half the night laughing until I cried. It's not politically correct, but sometimes you just have to have a sense of humor. (Look, I drive a Prius, I recycle, I say "African American" even if I am not totally sure the descendant of African to whom I am referring is actually American or not, I vote Democratic, I was moved to tears by Barak Obama's speech at the Convention on Tuesday night, so how DARE anyone call me politically incorrect because I find the butchering of the English language on foreign-made products hysterically funny. I'm not berating anyone, I just think the end product is funny. And, by the way, while I am on this rant, using a pronoun to describe a group of people is GRAMATICALLY correct, it has nothing to do with POLITICAL correctness. They, they they.)  There, I feel better about that. I guess I'm really stressed about,well, the concept that I have to put on a tremendous party for the people who will probably lay me off when it's done, no matter what a good job I do. It' s a little bit like having to arrange my own funeral because there's nobody in the family competent enough to do it. The weird thing, is, I want to do a really good job. I want to knock their socks off. I want to stand there serenely in a beige suit with a painted silk scarf and have made it look like I can do the equivalent to a wedding for 100 guests in a week all the time. They'll never see my callouses, or, with luck, they'll never see my insomniac stress ravings on my blog, maybe my eye won't twitch. Maybe I should try to get some sleep.
