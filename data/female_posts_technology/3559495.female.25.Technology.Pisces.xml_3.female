I have the necessities and that's about it.    She told me that I shouldn't have bought such a large house.  "It's for a family of 6", she says.  I tell her that I'm well aware of that and was thinking of maybe getting some roomies.  She tells me I'm crazy, and should really think about getting a husband and some kids to fill the house and not roommates.  I don't know if I'm ready for that right now.
