It was a period of sheer toil, in emotions especially.  This time round, it's mama. I was in the midst of paying my groceries from Giant, last Thursday evening, when I received brother's message. She complained severe palpitations during late afternoon. Thank god, brother who'd just ORD, around the nook to bring her to Alexandra immediately.  She seriously need to bring down her HBP count of exceeding 200 (hypertension). Any further increase will equalize to high chance of paralysis *God Forbids*. The experts there too, suspects of possibilty of her heart failing. She's due for her heart check-up this coming Monday.  On the meanwhile, she should be getting ample rest, in the quiet, serene, personal-touch, my-family-favorite-hospital. And this dutiful daughter of hers, will come by everyday, and bring in food, that is non-hazard to her health.  In fact, the night I rushed to see mama, I banged with an old uncle, who performed his Umrah with us. He went there with her middle-aged daughter. His wife, the patient in AH, supposed to tag along, but she's not in the condition to come. Risky. I wanted to come by and visit her, but I did not see the uncle aroud yesterday.  Heading there again, right after knock-off. Hope to see mama better.
