Only strangers were allowed to venture into my sporadic vent-fests.  Then, one by one, close friends were let in, always after serious consideration and risk calculations: each friend imposing a new set of limitations on the contents of my blog.  Once these familiar faces began to roam the pages of my true self - new precaution measures had to be taken - the use of different languages in my blog, my secret "back door", and others.  But all the security measures in the world are not enough when one has a big mouth. And as  urlLink I have said in the past , I I was never too good at keeping my mouth shut.  Well, one of my colleagues was wise enough to put one and one together and found my blog. I am now an open book to one more person.   Welcome to my blog, Leon  (if you ever find the courage to come back here, now that you know I can track the hits on my blog).   For a short while, this door will remain ajar for you and other onlookers to peek in. Until I figure out a way to host my musings somewhere else, think of a new and improved security measure (ideas, anyone???) or just start a new, even more private Blog (until I give that one away, too).   Don't forget to wipe your feet before you step in.
