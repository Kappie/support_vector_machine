Life is dramaless, almost uncanning...it's scary, I don't know what too do. I am in withdrawl. Work is great...but slowwwwwwww, but I am not compalining. Love? who needs it?  Tigger found out he likes the water in the bathtub. He also found out if he sits to close to the edge he will fall in it. He also found if he does it two days later the same results will occur. Cats are smart.  I am on vacation soon and wondering what the heck I am going to do with a week off. I am broke...not complaining, just stating facts yo. So what? Now I have a car and no money. So what? I will sit at home, trying to get kitty off the microphone.  What I wouldn't do to be in a tropical paradise with a pina colada.  Pina Colada this.  Someone write something k.  great thanks Dicks.
