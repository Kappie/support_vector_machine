Now truthfully I'd never thought that there was an actual downtown just a collection of random shops that because of their proximity to each other justified the town calling it a "Downtown"...Anyway, went to go and see  urlLink The Heather Combs Band . She fuckin rocks....Literally. She was kickass. I cannot in words literally express how much she rocked my socks. Nevermind the fact that she played a 4 hour set with only a miniscule 15 minute break. Im thinkin that my $15 investment in her CD will turn round to at least net me a nice little drinking binge someday for the future...
