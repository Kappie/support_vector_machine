It's funny, but that's one of the 3 times I remember us holding hands in public.  I guess I'm still not sure what you mean when you say you're still "figuring us out." You've been saying this as long as we've been together, and I wonder when, if ever, your emotions will resolve. I would hope that after spending a few years together you'd have more conviction about your feelings.  Funny how it seems like as time passes we get closer in a lot of ways, but on some level we get further apart. Is that because we want essentially different things from each other? Or is that because of fear? I'm not sure what you want or wanted from me, but when I'm feeling down I imagine that all you ever wanted was the promise of good sex on a regular basis.  What I want and have always wanted from you has been more that that. I want the promise of the potential for deep love and the possibility of a committed relationship. Of course, I never expected any of this from you right from the start. But I did expect your good intentions and an investment of time and emotion to figure out what we could have together.  I know this is the wrong thing to say, but I really need to know that you love me. If you truly don't know what you feel, then I need to get out of this now. I need to move on and find myself again , I need to live.  Cotton Candy Wishes, Me
