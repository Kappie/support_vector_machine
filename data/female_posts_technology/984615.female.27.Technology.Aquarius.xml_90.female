Regardless:  CORRECTED: U.S. Terror Warnings Lack Specifics - Report By REUTERS Published: July 13, 2004 Filed at 11:55 a.m. ET  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. government terror warnings to local police and citizens fail to give the specific information many authorities say is needed to protect the public, a congressional report said on Monday.  The report follows a series of official warnings about possible attacks -- most recently voiced last week by Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge -- which lacked new intelligence or details on the threat and how to respond.The report by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, was based on survey of 28 agencies and 56 states and territories. Those responding ``generally indicated that they did not receive specific threat information and guidance, which they believe hindered their ability to determine and implement protective measures,'' the report said.  Some critics have accused President Bush's administration of using terrorism warnings as a political tool. Bush has made the fight against global terrorism a major theme of his campaign for reelection.   Only to later yesterday find out that there were terrorist threats Possibly to occur at or around November election dates. Uh yeah. Bush fo sho ain't usin nuttin like terror-ism to git me away from the votin box.   whooo-eee!!!
