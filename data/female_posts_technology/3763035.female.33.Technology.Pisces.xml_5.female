If the weather holds out, might even work on that tan that I don't have yet.  I am Geek shade of Pasty White.  Renee always says that I'm the whitest white woman that she knows and usually chases me around with Sun Block.  It really sucks because Renee is half Indian and tans when she's hit with a reflection.  But I usually don't do the tanning bit because my family has a history of skin cancer if exposed to it too much.  Besides, I just want my legs not to look like white sausage any more.  Great visual, eh?    Tonight is a repeat on American Chopper.  This so sucks.  Everything is a rerun except the movies and usually they are re-makes. And the Online game we play, Asheron's Call 2, is undergoing patching right now. Gah. Okay....I'm bored.  Maybe I'll break out my paints.  Haven't done that in a while.  Let y'all know how it turns out.  But YAY!  It's Friday.
