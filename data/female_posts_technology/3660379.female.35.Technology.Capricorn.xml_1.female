I blame this addiction on the pound or two that I've lost.  Ok, closer to 80 lbs, but, my point is, I LOVE TO BUY NEW CLOTHES, and I am no longer restricted to buying Plus Size Clothes!    Now, there's another reason behind this shopping addiction, as is outlined very nicely by  Prof. Ruth Engs, RN, EdD, of the Indiana University, Department of Applied Health Science,  urlLink  she writes:    "Shopping and spending will not assure more love, bolster self-esteem, or heal the hurts, regrets, stress, and the problems of daily living."  Wow.. is that hitting the nail on the head, especially the part about love and self-esteem.   Because of various events in my life, such as divorce, a change of jobs, and failed friendships, I do spend a lot of time alone.  However, I'm really going to try and start connecting with people.  How am I going to do this, well, I have no clue yet, especially, because I do tend to be shy around new people.  So, if you have any suggestions, please let me know.  For starters, I'll use this blog to at least organize my thoughts, and try to start connecting with something or someone besides the mall.
