This is the Mysore Palace, Tipu Sultan's home back in the 1700s! Tipu Sultan was the king of So. India during that time. Its a beautiful palace and it lights up at night - with over a million light bulbs, very Burning Man 'esque. Tipu's great-great-great grandchildren still live somewhere in the palace.
