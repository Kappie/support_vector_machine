Los Angeles, CA   The drama of Virtual WCM's missing PDA came to a startling conclusion at approximately 10:30 pm PST last night.  After two hours of rigorous house cleaning, multiple phone calls crying to parents and a severe bout of paranoia, Virtual WCM located her missing PDA in the strangest of places - high atop her bookshelf, seemingly out of reach.    When she confronted Gandalf about how the PDA came to be on the bookshelf, she was startled by the kitten's frank confession.  "Listen. God told me that if I didn't destroy the PDA it would take over the world's computers and turn into a giant Rosie O'Donnell-like amorphous blob.  I didn't want that to happen.  So I took the PDA and hid it from you.  I was all set to knock the PDA off the bookshelf, destroying it forever, when I had second thoughts.  I knew that you would never think to look there, so I just told God that I had destroyed it and left it alone.  Can I have some tuna now?"  Appeased, Virtual WCM let Gandalf off the hook, although she did withhold canned food until morning.  "I just don't understand what makes Gandalf think that God is talking to her," mused Virtual WCM, "I mean, does she think that because she's named after a wizard she can really do magic?"  We may never know.
