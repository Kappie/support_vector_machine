I love Van Gogh's color choices, and his brush strokes really help create a mood.  There was a really sad painting of a man with his face in his hands.  It's cool to go to a museum with someone who actually knows how to look at art academically.  He's taken a bunch of art history classes.  Apparantly ART101 has an entire lecture on Mondrian.  I think I may have slept through that one.  (I PDFed the class.)  Anyway, I'm totally inspired to start drawing again.  It's been a while since I've been doing any serious painting, so I think I need to draw first and slowly get back on the horse.  Tonight I have to start the packing process for a trip to Boston on Thursday.  I haven't even started my lists yet.  Lots to do!  If a girl "swoons" what is the male equivalent?  Drools?  Feel free to write in suggestions.
