Theseare some of my favorite websites in the political vein:    Michael Moore:  urlLink http://www.michaelmoore.com   Al Franken /Air America Radio:  urlLink http://www.airamericaradio.com/pub/globalDefault.htm   Jim Hightower:  urlLink http://www.jimhightower.com/   MoveOn.org:  urlLink http://www.moveon.org/front/     Other:   urlLink http://www.toostupidtobepresident.com/    urlLink http://www.markfiore.com/animation.html      and, for the motherload:    urlLink http://www.linkcrusader.com/anti-bush.htm    Something to really think about:   urlLink http://www.alternet.org/story/14399        That's enough to get you started! More to come...
