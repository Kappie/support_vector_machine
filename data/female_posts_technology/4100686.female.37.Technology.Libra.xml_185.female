Maybe...  urlLink The Hypothetical Iraq Webloggers Council?  Of course, these are not the only options,  urlLink many  political  urlLink  parties  abound.  The choice is yours!  (If the "other" option is selected there's a little box there to enter "others" name in, thanks.)  Hmm what else, oh yes, i'll leave the PollMonkey ballot form up till the end of the week, see right -->  All ballots confidential.   urlLink
