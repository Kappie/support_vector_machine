I did the 2 shakes fruit and veggies during the day – except for the ice cream Lynda brought! Then for dinner I had more fish with beans and rice, and salad. (I was starving yesterday.) After dinner I had some sorbet, then a few spudz later, then 2 packages of melba toast! I was so hungry, I just couldn’t stop eating. I didn’t work out, as my body is still fighting back from my ab workout on Sunday, but I did get in some quality relaxing time. I am going to el gym tonight though. Back to the plan…back to the plan…
