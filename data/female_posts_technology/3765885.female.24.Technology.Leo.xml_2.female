Got for myself a denim skirt from Mango, and a blouse from Zara... and happily I skipped home to head for the pool! Weee~~~ finally... a chance to regain my tan!!! This is soooooo exciting... Dropped my shopping at home and packed up for the pool... The sun is shining so brightly! Perfect day for a nice tan! Off to the pool I went... and WALA!!!!! To my surprise... the pool is closed! CLOSED ON MONDAYS! arggg... there goes my swim... my tan... my perfect day!!! ="(
