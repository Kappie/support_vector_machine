I made it by the skin of my teeth.   Iwas a textbook drug addict. I startedsmoking pot at age 14. Bythe time I graduated high school, I was smoking it everyday.During that time, I took LSD/mushroomsmany, manytimes. By age 18, I moved on to bigger ( not better) things.I started snorting cocaine. I dropped the marijuana  stayed loyal to coke for another year or so.The part I didn't know was the reason I was doing this. I was clinically depressed I was using drugs to self-medicate.  When I was a kid, I was very afraid of needles. That fear was long gone by age 19 whenIstarted shooting coke on a semi-regular basis. But, with coke, there was one major problem - having to come down.When the money ran out  the drugs were gone for the night, the feeling of depression would be 1000 fold.   All of this was leading up to the big one. The drug that would become my whole life. The drug that took me from a contributing member of society to a thieving, sometimes homeless, suicidal, family-estranged, diseased junkie.   More to come...
