He stopped and looked around before climbing the backstairs of one of the taverns.  Truan guessed it was the Red Bull but he wasn't sure since most taverns looked the same from behind.    Truan climbed the stairs quckly and quietly.  He didn't trust him not to lead him into trouble.  The King's guards have wanted him for a long time and he wasn't about to be handed over like a gift-wrapped horse.    "This way.  Your uncle is in the last door by the stairs on your right.  I will stay here and guard the doors."  The dark spectre waved toward the said door.    Truan approached quietly, glancing up the hallway and behind him.  The place lacked lights which created many shadows for which Truan was very grateful.  He knocked quietly on the door.  Suddenly it opened.  A hand reached out, grabbed his shirt and pulled him in, closing the door behind him.  Truan felt crushed against a large chest in a large bear hug.  "Come, Come.  Sit, have a drink."  A deep growl said.  Truan was suddenly let go and pushed towards a chair.   He glanced over his shoulder at the big burly man.  It must have been a long time because he didn't remember his uncle looking like that or even that tall.  Truan sat down on the edge of his seat, ready to run for the door or for the window which ever way was clear.    "You might not remember me.  It's been at least ten years since I saw you.  I remember you was about six when I last visited the castle.   I, of course was heartbroken to hear about your father and mother.  I loved them both dearly.  Of course I felt even worse when I heard that you also was killed.  It wasn't until a month ago that I heard differently from a letter sent to me by some woman named Martha Wettle.  Of course I rushed back to the city to see if I could still locate you that you was still alive in the streets."  the big burly man sat down and poured himself a drink from a pitcher on the table.    For that matter the room was sparce.  A bed against the far wall opposite the door and a table with two chairs  in the middle of the room was all that decorated the room.  Truan studied the man to see if he found anything he recognized.  He remembered his uncle had green eyes and so did this man.  He could vaguely remember that his uncle was tall with dark hair the same as this man.  He didn't know what to believe at this time.    "I know that you don't trust me.  You probably don't remember much of me but let me see if I can tell you a few things that only a member of the family would know."  All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003
