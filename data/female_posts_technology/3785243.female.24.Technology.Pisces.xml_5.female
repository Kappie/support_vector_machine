Being a party of only oneself tends to let you do that.  However, I can't help but point out this bit of silliness from the Kerry side of the voting population.   urlLink Bluetooth Users Against Bush   Basically, the site tells you how to use cellular phones and bluetooth enabled PDAs to make political statements.  Unfortunately, I cannot locate a bluetoothusersagainstnader.com or bluetoothusersagainstkerry.com site, otherwise I would post those too for objectivity's sake.  However, according to this source, they have inspired another site,  urlLink Blueroots.org  where you can start your own bluetooth campaign for your personal pet issues.  -- Aeryth
