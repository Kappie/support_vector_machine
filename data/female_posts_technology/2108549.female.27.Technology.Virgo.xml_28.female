Not a bad day all in all, went and had lunch with M.A. Afterward I was supposed to go meet with my sponsee but she cancelled so Freedom and I headed over to the park so he could get a little fresh air and exercise. Went through Sam's Club to get the pictures and now I'm home.  I'm so tired lately, I'm hoping tonight will be a good sleeping night.
