Prior to that, there had already been information flying around. 1 to 2, 2 to 4. It came to a point where I felt overloaded with 'secrets'. Like a over absorbed sponge, information got leaked out. Who got the right version of the rumour? I don't really care. I only want to know who get retained. After much speculation, we were surprised that the company could only afford ONE headcount. Although I've lucky-guessed it, I'm still quite taken aback that my dept got none.   The company did not do so well for Q2, CEO was quoted "disappointed" to the sales result. Although Asia Pacific did extremely well, it wasn't enough to cover for US/Europe. Initially my mgr seem to be hopeful, and very eager to meet the VP to try to bargain for at least one 'slot' for my dept. After the release of the CEO's stmt, his hope vanished. Now, their concern is to keep the current heads. Finger crossed that there won't be retrenchments.  It was quite a dramatic week I'd say. Speculations and expectations. It was so exciting! But at the same time upsetting. For one, I felt sort of betrayed by a fellow colleague.   This colleague had knowledge of another avail. vacancy, and it's not hopeful for my dept but he chose to keep mum. I can't blame him. It's his nature. But to think I had worried for him, called him up to let him know of the job vacancy and to be told that he had knew about it couple of mths back. Bastard! I was such an idiot at that point. I was still thinking, "oh good.. u had been considered. so you have chance.." instead of "u knew! and didn't tell me?!". My processor is too slow, needs an upgrade! It saddens me. I thot we started out as a group and we'll watch each others back. I'm so wrong. Then again, it's fortunate that there's not knives or daggers sticking out from my back.   Some kind of a team I have. The interns at the other dept are so much more mature. Mine will compete, get jealous, retain information, make use, blah blah blah. That's prob why I made good friends out of those at the other dept.   Now that the whole saga has settled down, I finally had time to sit here and type my blog. It had been a great year. Made some great friends, learn some new things (about weird, strange and scheming people), boosted my resume with a MNC name, gained exposure.. Can't wait to find out what I'll land myself next. =)
