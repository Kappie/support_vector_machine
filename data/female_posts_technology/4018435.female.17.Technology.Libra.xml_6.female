Of course I'm not in the greatest mood because of so many different things, but i'll have to do what everyone is telling me to do. Forget about the person I love because they don't seem to be worth it. IF they can act as though I'm not important to them, then I shouldn't let them or their stuck up family win. I should show them how strong I am and that I can succeed to a higher level then   ANY   of them ever could in their antisocial and money obsessed lives.   This is the begining. Although I have not yet finalized that this relationship is over...he is making it seem that way. So I should prepare myself now.  I'm hoping that this journal will be a fresh start so that I don't have to think of too many bad memories, but to keep track of the good ones. Of course I'll write about my horrid days and issues that really piss me off, but this is for my own good. Life's too short and I should remember the best of it...even if it means getting over heartbreak over and over again.       Today my brother tried to cheer me up and took me out to eat. It was great cuz I got to tell him about a few funny things and he laughed at me really terrible jokes. He's become one of my best friends. Working for the same company at a different location is halarious. When I need to call his store to ask if they have something our store doesn't, people look at me funny when I said "Hey big bro" or "Can you check if you have this item for a customer?....Aww! Why not!?" Of course he's joking. We always joke about how if we ever worked together, work would never get done cuz all we ever do is talk and laugh and make crack jokes and act like hyper children, meaning we'd never get anything done in the store. In some way's it's kinda good that the company wont let anyone with any family or dating relationships work together. Cuz whew, everyone in the company is either related or is dating someone within it.  I bumped into Kelly at the mall. Can't wait to hang out with her tomorrow for a bit. Hopefully take stuff off my mind. I'll be helping her and her sister prepare for their other sister's baby shower. Wow, can't believe the baby's almost here.  What I'm really looking forward to is seeing Heather this weekend. She's so hard to get a hold of, but hey, I know she doesn't do it on purpose. She's on of those people I'd love to hang out with more though. She was gona for teh first part of summer and on Monday she'll be leaving for about a month...*sigh*  Shawn's leaving for Winnipeg tomorrow/this morning. It's almost 3 am... and Shane has summer school and will be working at rogers all day-every day when he's done. There aren't too many people that I'm close to anymore and I feel as though I have no one. I gotta stay strong.  Yup, gotta hold my head up high.    There's a possibility on me going to the phillipines with my mom for a few weeks. Damn, i'd love to go cuz I've never been in my entire life (other than going when my mom was pregnant with me). The question is, will I be able to last there with my breathing problems? I'm hoping to talk to my doctor about this first and then see if I can go or not. Also, I wont be back for the first week of school. Meaning I gotta figure out how to work that in. Arg...That's okay...all the first week of school is is shuffling people from class to class anyways...   So here I am again....The Lonewolf...I'm lonely...and I miss him so much...If only he knew.  I gotta stay strong. If it ends here, then I have to end it right. The proper way. It can't end the way it is now.   Well, there's my first ramble. I hope I can stick to a routine to write in here at least every few days at the VERY least once a week.  From the depths of dispair....The Broken Heart -Lonewolf
