Your feet are extended by at least 1 full inch. So far, the only thing I can do with these shoes on is turn on my computer while sitting in my chair. (I do not have to stoop below my desk and manually push the power button.) I'm sure there are other hidden functions that these shoes can perform. I will wait and see.
