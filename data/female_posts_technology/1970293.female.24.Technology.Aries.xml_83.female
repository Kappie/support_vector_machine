The last time they were loose on the lands they destroyed everything, farms, crops, animals, and people. They left no stone unturned in their wake." The dragon turned his eyes toward the stars.  "Why is it so hard to believe that the Drakken are here in the forests?" Bardric looked at the dragon.  "Because when we banished them from the lands into their own country, we put enough magical resistance on the borders that no one could enter or leave that country. With the Drakken here, it means that the magical barrier is down when it should have lasted as long as the world lasted. I would like to know who did it because the Drakken have no magic to even have tried to destroy that barrier. At this time we can speculate that it was a powerful wizard or sorcerer."  "I can help figure out who did it then since I know most of the wizards in the business." Bardric slowly closed his eyes as Trellian kept watch for the night.
