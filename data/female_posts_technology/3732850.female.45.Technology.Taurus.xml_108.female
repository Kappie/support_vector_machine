She writes about the treatment she gets while living where she does, and how it makes her feel less like a human. She explains how she spends a typical day, either in bed or watching T.V. Anna explains what happens when people die and how it's just like another day for the workers, and she also tells about the comforts of the wheelchair.  I like this essay because it's not a essay thats all complaining. As a reader I can tell she's not complaining, she's just trying to open others eyes as to how she feels and how she's treated now that she's in a nursing home. She tells about her world before and how it is now. I can tell she excepts why she's there, it's just hard to except how she's treated.
