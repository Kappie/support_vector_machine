We all have a voice - even if no one is listening.    I'm a rambler - what I ramble about will generally depend on what goes on in my own life.  Or perhaps what bugs me about the world at large - and trust me - I'm a girl who has an opinion about everything - so you've been warned.   .  Hopefully this site will be fun and therapeutic.  And if you are at all entertained - bonus. :)  Just remember - sometimes I'm a "stream of consciousness writer"- so if I ramble (and I will) - that's just part of who I am. :)  And remember: Just for Today, Be Happy :)  cutesox
