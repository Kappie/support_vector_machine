I wondered a lot about if my kids felt okay with me being with another man. I know that that they didn't want me back with their father.    Then, I thought maybe I should tell him I don't want anything the do with him and to leave then on the other hand he was a good man, he listened to what I had to say and he didn't tell me that I was stupid or that I couldn't think that way. I wanted to be with someone and then I wanted to feel the freedom I never had with my first husband. I lived like a prisoner.    I wanted to share my day with him and then I thought we could just be friends and how does a man and women do that my ex use to say that was impossible. It think people can have a friend that is the opposite sex without being lovers.
