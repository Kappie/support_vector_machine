My doctor just knew where to press to make it hurt.  Anyhow, I am now the proud owner of some really great anti-inflammatories and muscle relaxants.  Here's hoping that they work, and that they work well, because I've got painting and hardwoods to work on this weekend!!!  On a different note, I have an addendum to my list of things never to say to a sonographer.  Actually, it might be more of a rant.  IF you are coming for an obstetrical ultrasound, and you bring your spouse along, that's completely fine.  But, when I ask you (you, being the pregant woman) to slide your pants and underwear down past your bum (and we do this so that we can ultrasound your cervix, and get a good look at the baby's presenting part, whether it's head or bum), PLEASE, please, PLEASE, could the husband/spouse/father of the baby, please keep the "Well, that's how we ended up here in the first place!" comments to yourself!  I have NO desire to hear the story of your child's conception.    Okay, nuff said.  -J.
