They aren’t wearing enough clothes for it to be someplace where castles are cool (well, Greenlee always has on too many clothes for my tastes and Ryan not enough). I like my castles with snow and kilts. Mouthbreather:  This here castle is real fine. Like in that movie about Harry. You know, I could’ve been in that movie, I’ve got a bigger brow than that lame ass kid they picked. And the eyebrow to match.  Greenlee: Uh huh. Listen, do you think Kendall is on her way to stalk me at this very moment? I planned all this because I just love a good hair pulling fest in an exotic location! Mouthbreather: (whines) Greenlee! Forget her! It’s all about me. Hey, lets make out so people we don’t know and will never see again will think our fake getting married is for real! Greenlee: Jesus wept they are really not paying me enough to make out with you, you brain damaged monkey. FINE, I’ll just pretend you’re Kendall. When’s she getting here anyway?  Kendall and Simone (who’s sporting something extra fruity by the way) are in the PV private jet.   Simone: Do not let this plane take off so you can stalk Greenlee! I’m right here and clearly I’m more than willing to keep you entertained. Kendall: Gah! I must have Greenlee. Those arms, that lip gloss, she makes me crazy. We are taking off. You can come along or get off the plane. Whatever. Simone: Yeah! The plane should take off now. We can get drunk and make out in the air. Kendall: Why would Greenlee leave town without first giving me the chance at a colossal slap fight? Is it still sweeps? Do you think there’s a catfight planned for when we get there? Simone: Stop the plane! What if Greenlee slept with Mouthbreather? Ew! Kendall: Then she’s been very naughty and she will be receiving a spanking the moment we arrive! Now  get me a drink!  Simone: Yes ma’am!  At Jacks’ groovy pad for wayward lesbian moms, little boys with hair extensions who need acting lessons and all manor of wacky daytime high jinks: Tad: Erica is a nut ball. She’s in Las Vegas acting like she’s 12, it’s 1980 and Dallas’s Larry Hagman is the epitome of cool. And very possibly she’s freebasing.  Bianca: I hate my mom! My girlfister tried to tell me Erica was an 170 year old minor demon with a contract that predates the birth of christ stating she can come up with any freak show fairy tale story line she feels like and we all have to go along with it! But would I listen? Hell no! I was too busy with the rack checks!  Jack: Now, now precious, we have no idea what’s going through your mothers’ head at this time.  Bianca: Going through her head?!  Are you kidding me?  Have you even met the woman? Her head is merely something to attach her wig to! And possibly, she’s freebasing. Tad: Amen to that sister!  In Las Vegas: It’s not really worth discussing except to say that when Bobby tries to take away Ericas’ bloody Mary flames shoot out of her eyes and that, ladies and gentlemen, is why Bobby has only little patches of hair all over his face.    At the Hospital: Huey Lewis (aka Edmund) pitches a colossal hissy fit and chucks a bedpan at a male nurse. I really have no idea why he was pitching one I just know I was sad because he was not singing “I want a new drug” at top volume. Um, Anita witnessed all this. Isn’t it about time for her to “comfort” Bianca again?
