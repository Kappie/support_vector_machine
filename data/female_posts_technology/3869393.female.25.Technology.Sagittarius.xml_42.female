It's not as though that hurts her, but the way in which people then start to ask questions, and one suddenly begins to wonder if there is something wrong with themselves!  Painful a thought, but thats an insight into my life at the moment!  This morning, got a call from my schoolmate from Dubai, she's getting married this month, and wanted some help with regards to her makeup and jewellery etc.  I kindof was modest and told her that I exactly aint the right person to ask, coz I've never been thro' the routine to give expert opinions....odd, but thats the truth..as much as I am a good mix and matcher wth regards to stuff, when it comes to marriages, jewellery, makeup and sarees...hmm....dont think I'm up there still.  Nevertheless she insisted, and I said okay, and began to give her some pointers.  But then, since one cant exactly give a makeup routine or jewellery combination without knowing the sarees to be worn, I had to listen with great intent on the saree combinations too.  This was probably the worst thing which I needed to hear about!  I had to listen to saree combinations, for which occasion, who purchased them, etc.  Man, this was utterly painful, and completely ironic....I should have been in this position now, choosing stuff for myself...haha...and what do I get to do, I have the opportunity to instead do it for my friend and her to be sis in law.   Life can be ironic, but this is probably the worst thing I needed at the moment.  I really dont want to think about marriages, but all I have around me, people who remind me of the same, relatives who give proposals and unknown people asking questions to my parents as to why their 25 yr old beautiful daughter aint married!  This pain is something a little too unimaginable for me right now, I know what my parents are going thro'..but why cant people understand what I am going thro' before they keep jumping the gun, make statements  comments and open up my excessively bruised wounds!  This brings me to the question, which I have really been asking myself, Why is marriage such an important aspect for others with regards to me, but of absolute and complete hatred for me???
