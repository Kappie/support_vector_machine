Ron is cream cheesing a toasted bagel.  ron: good morning me: grunt.. me: thanks for the bagel.  ron: is that how much you like on there? me: yeah. now hurry it up. i'm technically still asleep. ron: we don't pay you to sleep. me: actually you do. it's in my contract. ron: that explains a lot with the kind of work you've been turning in. me: i'm not taking this crap. i'm going back to where people like me.  walk back to my cube where justin is blasting on my dinky computer speakers.  jann (50-something Fijian cube neighbor, my work mom): turn it up, tania (i mean abby)!  justin: Go on and just cry me a river, girl!
