What it boils down to is the hospital fucked up and do not want a law suit so they are trying to pin shit on me.  I need a new job so bad.  I am thinking about going back to administrative.  I know I went to school for neurodiagnostics but the jobs are slim and few so I need to make some sacrifices.  I think I am just going to have to send my resume all over the place because this is ridiculous. I need a Mon-Fri 9-5 job. I like working my hours at the hospital though Mon-Fri 7=330 or 8-430. Either way it is sweet.  The only part that sucks is the being on call on the weekends, but it is part of the job.  I love my job and helping my patients but the hospital I work for is horrible and I would never send anyone there.  Pretty sad actually.
