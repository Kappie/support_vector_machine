Wrapping herself tigher, she wished the snow could have waited a little longer.  She didn't mind the snow but sometimes it did cause so many problems.  The snow only had to wait another week or two at the most.  Then it could have snowed ten feet.  She didn't care.  Her pierced through the darkness but still she couldn't see anything.  She waited a little longer.  Finally her shivering wouldn't stop so she decided to go in the warmth and wait.  She hated to wait.  Waiting is the worse thing in the world to do.  There was no more cleaning to do so she wouldn't be able to keep herself busy from thinking.  She sighed as she sat down on the sofa and pulled a blanket on top of her.  She huddled and shivered until she felt warm enough to move once more.  Maybe she should go out a little longer and wait.  All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003
