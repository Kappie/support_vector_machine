I want to live the easy life, when I need something I can just go get it, nothing to big like a car. Just the little things, like if my kids want a big swimming pool I can get it and it won't matter how big it is.  I want to move out of the trailer court and have a pretty big house not to big, I don't like to clean a big house just enough rooms so the kids have big bedrooms and when my step-daughter comes over for the weekend she has her own room and doesn't have to share with my daughter.  I want to travel some day, and right now money is stopping us and if I get a good paying job, then my husband can slow down and be able to spend more time with us. He can have a couple days off or even vacation time, so that we can go out and play like a family should when theres enough money.  I want to be setting really good. I kind of now in some ways, but in other ways we don't, we sometimes live pay check to pay check and I don't want to live that way any more. If my husband got hurt and couldn't work for awhile I might have to quit school and get a job. I want to have enough money so if he did get hurt then we don't have to worry and maybe I can work at home, so I can take care of him.
