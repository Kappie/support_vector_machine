Anything emotional relating to them all comes floating to the surface.  Somewhat like an Exxon oil spill in the heart of the Alaskan waters.  Oily, dirty, smelly and foul.  Nothing good can survive in water like that.   I have lots of people in my life that I don't keep in regular contact with but are still in my heart.  Some going back to before I was a teenager.  The relationships survive, without a problem, us not talking for months and months.  When we get together, its like no time has past, quite comfy with the relationship.  I have others that for whatever reason (usually bad) are no longer in my life and contact from them is unexpected, scary and foreign.  I don't  like  being caught off guard.  I don't  like  being surprised.  I don't  like  the unknown.  And I  despise  being conflicted over how I feel about someone as far as like vs. dislike. I like knowing what is gonna happen next, I like consistency, I like stability.  Mostly though I like knowing where people stand in my heart at all times.   If someone rips something away from me, be it a dream, a fantasy, something material or nonmaterial... I fight to keep it.  I fight until my knuckles are bloody from hanging on to that thing for so long.  And then once I am worn out, tired of fighting, I accept the loss.  Usually not gracefully, usually not without a whole lotta tears.  But I do get to the acceptance part.  I can't unaccept that defeat just because someone wants to return what they took away.  At that point I all the fear of losing it again come flying back up.  Flying up like a blender with the top off on full speed blending tomatoes juice and milk.  It's just not pretty and its truly gross and way too messy.   I'm at the point of fear and hurt and anger and sadness.  What could have been, never really was and what I lost, I never really had.  Wouldn't taking it back then mean that I was backing to holding on to something that wasn't mine and wasn't real?  Sort of like trying to hold on to air.  I've looked over this ledge before, I think I need more than just air to stand on.
