So she invited me to join her in San Francisco for about a week in August. If the air tickets are confirmed, I'll be flying off on 31 Jul and be home 10 days later - 10 Aug. Isn't that great?! Although I've been to that part of America, I didn't mind at all cos the last time I didn't get to see much of SFO, esp the Fisherman's Wharf.   But I feel guilty, that I'm not earning, jobless and still making a such an expensive trip. :P I'm investing about $2-3K into this trip. Really quite outrageous. But if I don't do it now, when will I have the time and company?   Another trip I have in mind is a volunteering program. A grp of 25 will be at Cebu, Philippines for 3 weeks to help them build schools, set up computers, conduct trainings and such and such. It is subsidised for those below 30yrs old so I'll just need to pay $600. Cebu is a wonderful place to dive. It'll be so idea to volunteer and then dive afterwards! *drool*. This takes place in Dec but I have to register by Aug 23. The problem is, can I commit the whole of Dec to Philippines? (It's rather dangerous - lotsa kidnapping of foreigners.) What about work? That's the draw back. I can't commit at the moment. Another obstacle is, going alone. My siblings either aren't keen or can't commit. Same goes for friends. And my parents will NEVER let me go alone, esp to such 'dangerous' place. (Actually, to my mum, everywhere is dangerous. 8-|. Even to Pulau Ubin. She goes on like this, we'll never learn.) This is really a good time. Right age, right attitude.. I just need to make that commitment.  Just hope I'll find a job soon to finance my travel plans. I'm itching for diving already. =P
