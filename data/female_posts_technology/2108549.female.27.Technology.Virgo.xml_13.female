I wasn't and am not 100% comfortable there yet but com'on its only been 1 day. My schedule is gonna be 7:30-4:30 M-F.  Its kinda nice its makes it so I miss a lil of the rush hour traffic.  It took almost an hour to get home tonight for what is usually a 20 minute drive.  With going in earlier it'll probably only take a half hour.  I'm taking  urlLink this picture  with me tomorrow to put on my desk.  I am the only female there and the guys are really really nice, its kinda fun to be treated like one of the guys.  And I have the whole 2 stall bathroom to myself!  :D
