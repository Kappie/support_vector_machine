Yesterday was too damned busy.  Sure we were shorthanding one person with René out at class - but that is really no excuse.  I was amazed that I did 42 calls for the day.  And what's worse is these people were idiots!!  Give them a week or three off during the Phoenix spring, let the temperature reach 90 degrees for the first time this year and their brains go " DUH-UHHHHHHHHHHH ".  Drives me nuts.  Today had better be better.
