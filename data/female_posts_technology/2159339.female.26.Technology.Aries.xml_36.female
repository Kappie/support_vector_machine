I should have minded my own business, but she was really loud and I couldn't help but overhear. She had a Moscow accent, but it turned out she is from the same town that I'm from, a small urban hub in the middle of rural ukraine. I kept hoping she would mention some of the places I remember, but of course she didn't. Instead I found out that her family still lives there and that her brother desperately wants her to move back. Their father remarried and had eight children with his new wife and now can't support them. The girl kept telling her brother (Nikita) that she can't move back because she won't be able to find work and agreed to send money in two weeks. I know things have changed in 15 years, but the picture in my mind is fixed - the marble statue of lenin, the flower booth on the far end of the town square, the bakery with the giant chimneys.
