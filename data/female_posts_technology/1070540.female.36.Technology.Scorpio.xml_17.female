By the time I leave work it is 600-630 and I dont get home til about 630-700.  Then I cook dinner and feed everyone (I usually eat standing up so I can get done faster) then I  make sure homework is done ,bath children,. Pickup the Kitchen  notice I did say pick up and not clean. by the time  i get a chance to go to the bathroom its 11 o'clock at night.  Then I think....  I can clean now...then I am too tired to do it .  My job is so mentally exhausting that It is hard to function when I get home.     I will clean my house,  I do not want to live in a pig stye.  I am so tired of it.  But, when I do get it clean I dare anyone to leave a mess.  I will go OFF>  I know I will.   I think my family is staying sick cause I cant get our house clean.   I want a HEALTHY AND HAPPY family.
