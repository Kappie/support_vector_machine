ALL SLOW.... because they don't seem to understand what's going on .... at least half the time, i could prolly lie to them and they'd believe it. friggin' sheep.       talking that slowly really, really, really irks me. i don't have the patience for this bullshit. i need a new job...       time to make those 'i hate stan' pins :P
