My second thought was that my own comments linked to mine. I immediately pressed the link on my comments to confirm. I was right.   Then I browsed through my own site, even though I know every little word and picture in it, trying to see it as he might see it if he linked through. [I do this a lot, revisit my site after i know someone has looked at it, re-read my post after I know someone has read it - trying to see through their eyes]. I wasn't happy with the fact he might have seen my pictures.   Then I linked to Y's site. It's his blog.  As I was reading his posts - eloquent, meaningful, dramatic while remaining understated - a feeling of inadequateness (?) came over me.  Relief that in my comments I to my album site and not to my blog.   His blog - adult.  My blog - a child's.
