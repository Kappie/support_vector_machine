It's like a tragedy or something if I forgot toothpaste, even though I have like 7 opportunities to buy toothpaste before I ever need it anyway.  It's not like I'm going to a third world country.  I think B packs lighter because chances are if he forgot something, I have it.  Like band-aids are on my list.  And 2 separate purses.  Extra batteries for my gameboy advance (fun on the plane).  3 paperbacks.  I've gotten comments on the fact that I even have a list.  It's sorted by clothing, accessories, health, other stuff.  There's also a list by day of what I plan to where each day down to purse, belt, shoes (need to make sure I pack all the pieces).  And of course there's the list of things to do as I walk out the door: turn off computer, close blinds, drop bills in mailbox, leave rent check written out in apartment in case something happens and I don't make it back to Seattle by June 1st.  I'm really excited for this trip.  There are lots of people that I haven't seen in a year that I'm sure I'll bump into.  And Pat McGee band is playing.  And I'm going to the Triangle show.  I'll have to post some pics when I get back.  But for now, I have to pack!  Only half the items have been checked off the list!
