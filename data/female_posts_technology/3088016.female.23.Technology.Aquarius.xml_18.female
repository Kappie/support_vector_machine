Maybe the truth is actually that it's always been this way and I'm just now starting to notice and be affected.  It's the quintessential  urlLink Dilbert  scenario.  We have the Wallys who show up at 10, leave at 3, and avoid work like the plague.  There are plenty of pointy haired bosses.  I had seven bosses (some pointy haired, some not) at last count.  There are Elbonians, but their homeland is somewhere in Alabama.  One of the Elbonians now works for us.  There is definitely a Carol the Secretary, though my old department was even more chock full of them.  My favorite Carol strip was the one in which the PHB was asked to cover her job for a while, so he offered to call her kids and yell at them for her.  There are a few Dilberts and a few generic characters as well.  If anyone can tell me that their office isn't run the same way, I'd be impressed and skeptical at the same time.    I guess I'm a little like Alice, but I am much nicer than she is in front of people.  I used to think I was more like the naive Asok the Intern, then I wisened up to the fact that we're not immune to office politics.    Politics at the Office  I have gotten some email messages from one co-worker who is keeping up heavily with the labor issue that President Bush is working on.  He has forwarded the emails to a bunch of people at work demanding activism, and every time they're from AFL-CIO left wing nutjobs who spin things so far to their side that they're misleading if not inaccurate.  The former-Elbonian and I discussed today how unfortunate it is that we can't find any news that isn't slanted.    People deal with this different ways.  I tend to balance out my mainstream leftie editori-news with  urlLink Fox  and some occasional discussions by Savage and Hannity on the radio.  On the reverse side, I still listen to NPR.  When I tried to get the Fox take on the labor issue, they had just copied the incredibly biased AP version.  I won't include a link here, because it's not relevant and because I can't find a side of it that reports fact instead of opinion.  I do realize that the conservatives I read are also biased, but I like to believe they're more right [er, correct] than their counterparts.
