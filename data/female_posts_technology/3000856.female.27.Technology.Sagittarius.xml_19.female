I don't have doubts about my talents, but the difference between her and I is crazy! I really feel I would let them down in one form or another. What to do what to do. I guess just be me is all I can do and hopefully that is good enough. I am going to be scared as shit my first show w/ them not because of the crowd but because I will be so worried about what is going through the boys heads during the show. I need to sleep. Lack of sleep makes me get all goofy!
