The reason is because it has finally sunk in that I'm going to see Madonna in 2 days!!  No matter what you think about her, she is a legend.  I admired her when I was a 7 year-old girl, and I still respect her today.  For me, this isn't merely getting the opportunity to see her in concert.  It's much more than that.  When I was that 7 year-old girl, my father promised me over and over that he'd take me to see her.  He even went so far as to say that he had the tickets, and we'd be going that night.  Of course he never had the tickets, and I never got to see her in concert.  This is about vindication and having a dream finally come true.  I will write another post with my review of the concert during the week.
