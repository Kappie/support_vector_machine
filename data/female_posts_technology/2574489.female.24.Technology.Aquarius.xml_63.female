He got me callal lilies for my b-day, delivered to my office.  Well, it bloomed over the weekend and now the blooms are open and emitting heavenly scents that have made everyone in the place come by to take a sniff.    I took pictures so my husband can see them.  Maybe I'll post them later.  I think I'll go around and take pics of downtown too now that I have my digital camera with me.
