I find out Garryis a owner of Chemco now, a company which had sales of over 140Million dollars last year and he has issues helping out his kids? I struggle for grocieries and he buys his step daughter a new car? He has money to go on tropical vacations, but not a heart to meet his grand kids? I am embarrased.       I think I have a brain tumor, so if I drop dead today you all know why. I go for my MRI in September, I wonder if they can bump it up or if I can put my name down on the cancelation list? Waiting isn't fun. Why don't we have more mri machines? maybe i should build one. Hey, I can hook up speakers to my vcr....I bet I could make some kind of machine.        Kit Kats like the new place, they have the run of the house and you can tell they are loving it. baaaa daaaa daaa daa da I'm lovin it. Doyou love it?        We had a weeeny roast last night at lions park, how much fun was that? I learn't that Paul is a gourmet weiner cooker and I am the best at burning them. Amputee made good dogs, but she is patient.        great thanks   dick
