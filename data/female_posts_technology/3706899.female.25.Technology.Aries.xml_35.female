It makes the sock look all pebbly. --I cast on too tight, so the top edge pulls in. --I can't see how this damn thing is going to fit around my pudgy ankle. --This would look so much better in a variegated yarn, since the ripple stitch would be more obvious, but I chose a solid. --I haven't gotten to the heel yet. That's gonna be the hard part. --I can't think of a good way to store needle #5 when I'm not working on the sock. Somehow sticking it in the middle of the solidly wound ball of yarn isn't satisfying me.  Why my sock is good: --No ladders! --The pattern is incredibly easy to remember. The stitch repeat is conveniently the number of stitches on one needle. --Working with DPNs is easier than I originally thought. --I think my tension might be starting to even out. --It's going quickly. With probably a total of an hour of work, I've got over 2 inches done.  Right now, the goods are good enough to outweigh the bads, despite having less of them.
