We have actually started doing some testing - can you believe it?! It has crashed about 3 machines so far. What does the MGR say about that - we'll just send an email out to our folks telling them not to install it since we have it set to download automatically. Yeah that sounds like the most terrific idea anyone in IT every had for warning folks not to install something.  No seriously that is what the boss just told me. I of course shrugged and said, "Yeah I told ya it's not going to be a good one." What else could I say? Ok I guess I could have said - "Told ya so!" But I'm trying to be the better person here. Hey we all have to do some self improvement.  As Jen would say, "Nope, never bitter."  Now go back to screwing off while at work. :)
