I'm cold and it feels like 50 degrees around this town tonight, WTF!!  I want my well deserved warm weather.  Second thing, never have a person that loves to travel, live nears an airport.  It's f'in torture I tell ya!!  Also Summerfest is over and those semi-free concerts I will sorely miss.  Consolation prize - Cats tomorrow night!  This will be a busy week since I have to get all the documentation done so that someone can come into my lab and work.  Well most of it will be done cause there is just too much to document and not enough of my willingness to do it all.  Maybe while I'm gone for a week I'll be able to decide where in the South Pacific I wanna go. I'm still hung up on Fiji but it might not be as remote as I like.  We'll see.  Maybe I'll head for the Cook Islands instead or American Samoa.  Check out The Rock's home.  Wouldn't that be something? :)  Other good news.... My babies got their Lion haircuts and look adorable per usual.  Did I mention HDTV is damn awesome?!  Well it is and HDTV/Cable is damn good too.   Craig if you're reading this, you look damn handsome with those gray-distinguishing highlights.  Just thought I would mention it.  Sorry it wasn't in person but it looks like it will be awhile before the group gets together for dinner again.  Ren faire starts soon so go and have fun somewhat living in the past.   W, keep on truckin' safe.  OK the question is:  Shopping for decorating the home alone or with friends, fun or just something you have to do?
