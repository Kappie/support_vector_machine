All but one of my pins are in Texas or the Caribbean, from people I know, and that Canadian one is an automatic post from the system admin.  Of course, I'm grateful for all of the local people who read my blog.  My hope was that the people showing up to my blog from places like Saudi Arabia and Iceland would also post and that I could really see who's checking it out.  If this is your first and only time reading, please feel free to place your pin on the Guest Map.  If you're here all the time, thanks for coming back.
