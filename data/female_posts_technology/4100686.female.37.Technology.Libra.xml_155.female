One soldier says, at the end of the film, when you get off your couch with your microwave popcorn, you're going to forget about this, but we'll never forget.  "He's not saying whether he's for it or against it. None of the soldiers really did. I think that's the last thing on their minds."  Most, he says, just wanted to go home.
