So what that they went to neighbor Chuck's house - he was kind enough to call me and let me know they were there!   I put one in my walking shoes last night - no hip pain while walking around the house.  I'm wearing one today.  Hip is still a little sore.  I think it's because these shoes have a bit of a heel to them.   So I'm relieved about that.  I did finally get a call about the ice cream cake last night.  I didn't answer the phone, the roomie did.  So of course I blew it off this morning in IM's - it is after all, all good and there is nothing to worry about.  I've had some cake, and learned my lesson too!  ;)  Having a really good hair day today.  Doesn't make up for the yucky meeting this morning.  Something about this time around makes the application process review with developers seem like it's not going so well at all.  I'm bringing the project manager back in on it for assistance.  Other than that, I'm looking forward to walking the greenway this evening - I'll take it easy a bit just to make sure all is well.  It's just going to be so good to move again.
