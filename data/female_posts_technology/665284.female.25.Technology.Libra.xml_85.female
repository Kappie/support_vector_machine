Speak in English even if the person on the other line is speaking in Tagalog.  Health:  Still waiting.  Seems regular, but not right on schedule like it's supposed to.  I am talking about my menstruation.  Friends:  So out of touch.  Sorry.  My life, basically, is boring.  Yes, yes it's a sign that I am getting older :).  I try to put a smile to every day.  I had this idea for an essay about education last night, but did not get around to actually do an outline or organize what I wrote which is just a paragraph long.
