It is probably best to limit discussion of this blog to the blog itself unless you know how to encrypt the spoken word.        Sorry Kate, I didnâ€™t think anyone was listening in the lunchroom. I think we should start making up stories about how much speed we have been doing to help us lose weight, and see how fast that gets around.
