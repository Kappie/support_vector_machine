There is a link under my Lists category to my Netflix queue so the curious can see what my significant other and I are watching.  I've already sent back Casablanca (excellent, excellent movie!!!) and the SNL movie, so the Netflix fairies should be sending Lain shortly.  Lain is a Japanese anime movie that is fairly well acclaimed with tons of Apple and BeOS references tucked in amongst the plot.  I'm considering finding a host that lets me post ASP pages so I can do more fun stuff with this little site.  Any recommendations on a cheap, but reliable host?  -- Aeryth
