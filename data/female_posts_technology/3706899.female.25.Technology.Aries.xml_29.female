So tonight I'm going to: --finish the armhole edgings on Shapely --work on Eros --decide what's going with me on the trip --and maybe start Charlotte  Ambitious considering it's already 8, but since I slept all day (sick, not lazy), I think I have a chance. I started picking up stitches for one armhole before eating chicken soup, so I've got a start.
