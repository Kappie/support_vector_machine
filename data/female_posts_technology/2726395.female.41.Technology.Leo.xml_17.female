It seems this whole year, now it's more than half over, has been about one particular thorn. I have cried almost every night about it. I have been to therapy about it. I tried to travel away from it. Massage it out of my system. Work it out. Hate it out. But nothing is working, and now I am getting angry. I have always been resilient. I got over losing my sisters, my parents' idiocy, a car accident, becoming president of the German School. I have gotten over losing friends to death, to childbirth (Pam has a kid? Woops, she can't hang out with  us  anymore!) to moving away. But I cannot seem to get over Thomas Loecherbach. I have been taken down by a mild-mannered German engineer who wears short sleeve dress shirts on purpose and actually uses the front pocket.   I try to be philisophical about it. I mean, look, it was bound to happen. I knew it was over that night in the Spanish restaurant. When Nancy showed off her engagement ring, and I thought about how three weeks earlier Thomas was telling me he was coming to the end of his rope and was seriously considering ending it, I knew that someone I loved very much had either just made the biggest mistake of his life, or, someone I loved very much had spent the better part of two years lying to me. Either way, I knew I was no longer of value to Thomas.Or maybe I never was.And to find out about it that way wounded me in a way that is taking a very long time to heal.  I wish I could explain all this to him. But you know, what's the point. I keep telling myself, as I repeat these imaginary conversations,  he doesn't care about you. He wouldn't understand anyway. He already hates everything you haven't even said yet, what makes you think he'd listen to you now? Pam, he doesn't care about you.     If I were a different sort of person, I might be vengeful. I might break my promise of secrecy. I might let him know that I know Nancy was married when she got involved with Thomas. Hell, when I think about that now, it's so obvious. But no, no matter how many lies I've been told, no matter what promises have been forgotten, no matter how shabbily he treats someone who genuinely cares for him, I will not betray a trust.   Now I just want this thorn to go away. He's in Istanbul right now and I am still haunted. He's everywhere. In September I am going to have to see him every week. Right now I can work hard and teach myself to hate him, tell myself he's a lying, self-centered adulterer, but as soon as I see him, it melts away. Then I have to work up building those defenses again. I really, really just want the thorn in my side to go away forever, so I never ever have to think about him anymore. I will love him forever. But I just don't want to think about it.
