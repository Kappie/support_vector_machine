           
      my mum calls my work every morning to see if i'm still alive. if i'm on the phone or in a meeting or at a doctor's appointment, she calls my cell phone and leaves messages on both voicemails and then calls both numbers every ten or so minutes. i love mum to death, but she needs to chill the fuck out.
