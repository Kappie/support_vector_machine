A dream filled with chaotic images that caused her to wake up from a deep sleep.  She ran her fingers down his back wishing he was awake so she could tell him about her dream.  She smiled as she remembered a few hours earlier loving him.  She pulled the banket tighter as she wrapped her arms around him.  She gently kissed his shoulder.  He definitely was the love of her life.    She closed her eyes and calmed her breathing.  Slowly she placed herself in a favorite room inside her mind.  A calming and soothing place for her troubled mind.  Soon she dozed gently while thinking of her lover.  She squeezed him gently and smiled wishing for a repeat of that evening.
