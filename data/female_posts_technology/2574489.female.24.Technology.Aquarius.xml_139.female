Well yesterday evening, while it was still sunny we walked through the park near our neighborhood.  We had fun with hubby threatening to throw me over the ravine, me threateningly pushing him too.  These are the days when hubby calls be an angel, cause I'm not easily irritable and witchy with a "b".    Anyway, we're really very playful and silly.  So hubby turns to me on our walk back to the apartment and suggested we start snarling at each other if we meet someone on the path so we could freak them out. I burst out laughing. He is so bizarre with his train of thought. And I am sure he would have done it too if I had agreed. He is that weird... and unique.   I don't know what I would do without him.  I'll definitely miss him when I go to San Diego. I've already booked my flight! Woohoo!  It'll be minus hubby because he didn't think it was worth $300 plus each to spend not even a week there.  Plus there are 2 other people who have already approved for vacation in his department for the same 4th of July weekend.  My mom's not coming either.  Speaking of paying $300 plus for tickets. My grandma paid a little less than $200 for her ticket from San Diego to Chicago through Southwest Airlines. But Southwest has no flight between Dallas to San Diego so I didn't get a bargain. Sucks!
