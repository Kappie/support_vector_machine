Ah that feeling of desperation, of anticipating your next paycheck with double-time eagerness...Been there, done that...we'll get over it.   On another note...   We lost power tonight for about an hour. With the storm raging outside, our little apartment was all peace...no humming air conditioners, computers, or TV. Just candles soflty lighting the room and blanket and pillows sprawled on the carpeted floor.  Hubby and I were alone with no technology to disturb us. And I told him I was glad he was with me.
