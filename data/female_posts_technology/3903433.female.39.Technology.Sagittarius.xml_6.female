What a great group of people, and it's nice knowing there's a growing outrage in this country that's snowballing into, hopefully, more voter turnout at the polls.        urlLink http://www.moveon.org/fox/     Other interesting sites:        urlLink http://www.cursor.org      urlLink http://www.airamericaradio.com/pub/globalDefault.htm
