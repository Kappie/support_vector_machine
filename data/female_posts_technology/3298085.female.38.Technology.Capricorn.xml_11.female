I am feeling real upset right now. When the paranoid stuff starts I get real paranoid about stuff that isn't even true. I don't want to lose Melvin but, if I do I can handle it. I lost my whole family before. So today I should try to show him how much I love him and then maybe it'll work out. This is the most wonderful man of all my life that I have ever known and I love him. Buut things haven't been there best since we found out it was Schizophrenia. I guess while we were dating I should have told him about the "voices" but I didn't. Never thought that I would tell anyone. AT ALL      We have been together just over a year now.
