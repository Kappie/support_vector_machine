Our friends at Band Bitch AKA: Streetteam.net are putting together groups of people in various cities. They are looking for true Flogging Molly fans to help spread the word. They do all kinds of cool shit. Listening parties, bar patrols, record store scavenger hunts etc... If you're into it. Goto their website and sign-up yo help them, help us, help Flogging Molly!!!! urlLink www.streetteam.net   Via  urlLink Side One Dummy
