This week, the prof decided to meet three times instead of the usual two. That's (3 days x 4 hours) + (2 hours of commute/day x 3 days)+ (1 hour of homeword/class x 3 classes) = .... 21 hours!! Good lord, that's more than half of my working hours! I now have a running french commentary in my head as I walk around downtown. I look at someone and mentally tell them that I would like to substitute a salad for the couscous that comes with my braised rabit. Or that they need not bother with the medicine, I'll just stay in bed and drink lots of fluids.  The people in the class are pretty great. There's a mail order russian bride named Anastasia whose husband is american. She's very nice but insists on speaking russian to me even though I make a poing to answer back exclusively in english (or broken french). The's also another girl named Lynn who is a close talker but is bubbly and fun. There are several other characters, but I'll have to describe them some other time. Tomorrow we're going out to get drinks after class. Yay summer! Yay H! Yay to moving to Paris with Batty next summer!
