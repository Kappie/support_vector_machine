When he was young he talked of something he was given by his grandmother at the age of five after finding it "on one of my expeditions in one of her many cupboards."  My three brothers; Ricky, Kenny, Stevie, as they were called then, and I would explore my grandparentâ€™s house and grounds for hours.  There was always something new to discover, some new make believe game to play and enough dirt to cover us from head to toe.  My Aunt Barbara, mother's only sibling, rented a room from my grandparents.  She never married.  We were not allowed to go into her bedroom and I don't believe I ever saw what it looked like.  Years later when my grandparents purchased a different house, she moved out and lived on her own until her early death.
