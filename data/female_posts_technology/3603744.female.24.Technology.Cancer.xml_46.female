ArgHHHH!!! and i need one pronto...  on the lighter side .. i met someone who look like a carbon copy of ashraf sinclair...or is it really him? ntahla ..but thing is aku nampak dier kat pusanika while i'm having my lunch..so it can't be him can he?  oHH..looks like this weekend gonna be hell again....i spend my last weekend all alone..talking and cursing to myself and only god knows what i'm gonna to do this weekend.. seems that everybody evaporate last weekend.. tetiba hilang ..and i'm left alone counting the cracks on the wall.(first count 43, second count 49-maybe i bang the door too hard..)   i know ..i'm pathetic...my life is a truckload of rubbish...
