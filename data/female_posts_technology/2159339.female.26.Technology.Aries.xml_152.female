XX picked me up later and we went to Baker Beach together to spy on the sunbathing nudes. This spell of weather has been really swell. Why be a grouch when the sun warms your shoulders and your bare legs? There's no reason for crankiness when the salty ocean kisses you with it's delicate spray and you can stare openly at gorgeously naked breasts from behind your sunglasses...  But for every trio of sexy women with fabulous tits, there will be 50 tall pale men walking around with a shaved pink weenie and an ugly NASCAR cap. For every boner, there will be an anti-boner. So it is with the laws of the universe. Why is this so?
