He would open my ears to new bands and enrich my life. There were three bands that opened and here's my synopsis:  Restiform Bodies: Crap Irving: Crap Why?: Total Crap  I bear with crap because once in a while an opening band will rock my socks off and steal my heart. Examples: Bart Davenport, The Lovemakers, and Adam Green. If I hadn't arrived early to see these openers, my life would have remained shallow and meaningless. Not true last night. Last night the openers made me question my existence and why was I not snuggled up in the warmth and pillowy softness of my bed? Why... am I here? Why... am I being subjected to this crappy music made by egocentric and charmless indie guys? In the spirit of description and long-windedness here's an elaboration of the umbrella term "crap":   Restiform Bodies : Musically, they were like Gold Chains, but without the balance of a female voice to counter the testosterone. Essentially, RB is a white guy indie-rapper with dexterous and quick rhythmic rhymes. He had good flow, but not much range or performance. He wasn't magnetic or compelling, he was just there. White guy indie-rapper, what is it about you that'll make me take note? What differentiates you from the rest of your brood? It's not that I need a schtick, it's that I prefer to watch people with fire or hunger in their eyes. This guy was able but he didn't have a driving message or a palpable connection with the audience. He didn't need us, and so, it was torturous.   Irving  -- 5 skinny indie guys with overgrown mussy hair and scruffy faces. They started off singing a sweet 3 part-harmony that was fey and soothing, but 8 measures in, they turned it into a screechy wall of adrenalinized noise. Guys. Why do they always have to assert their masculinity? Why do they have to ruin good songs by putting up a wall? Literally and sonically? It's okay to be vulnerable. It's okay to sing sweet songs. I understand what they were trying to do: subvert conventional songwriting structure, continuity, and mood by juxtaposing sweet and light with heavy and charged, but they didn't do it intelligently. It wasn't balanced. They had some songs that were ditty-like and playful, but seriously, they need to practice more. They weren't tight and lacked cohesion. The best description I have for Irving is that they are 3 lead singers in one band. 3 run-of-the-mill, middle-of-the-indie-road lead singers.   Why?  - This band was tight. They were cohesive and focused. I just didn't like their music. The singer is passionate, but the crazy kind where you want to leave the premesis because you will get hurt. He spat a lot when he sang and during one song he went spastic and purposely smacked his head with his fist. He was full of self-loathing rage. Kind of like Oliver from "The O.C." Out-of-control and dangerous to himself and the people in front. Does lead singer also snort coke and tote guns? Where does reality end and TV begin? I can't remember what the music was like. I just remember tuning out and thinking why was I at this show when I could be at home listening to The Unicorns.    The Unicorns  - I endured 3 hours of sonic hooey to get to these guys, and it was worth it. It was worth the 3 hours of wasted non-refundable time. They came out barefoot and dressed in pink stage costumes. The keyboardist had a pink polyester cape with brown fur collar with matching pink pants. He wore a white shirt with pink suspenders. The guitarist wore brown pants with a regular belt and a pink fabric belt below it. He had no shirt on but wore a pink tie. The shirtlessness didn't disturb me because he looked like a 10-year old boy: small, pale, and undeveloped. There was a drummer too but he was a putz. I forgot what he wore.  They're fresh-faced and so young. The blurb in the noisepop program said they're straight out of high school, but they look straight out of grammar school. Once they started playing though, I was in heaven. If this is the future of rock, the future is in good hands. They're babies, but they're precocious, wise, sentimental, and enormously talented. Seeing them was like witnessing history. I was in the front row and they were alive and energetic and present in every song. How can a sound that's so relevant and versatile and perfect come out of these babies? Why is it that these Canadian boys can let down their defenses and sing without contrivance or a sarcastic sneer? There was no posturing, just silly fun, and great great music.
