For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. 53 For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality. 54 When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: 'Death has been swallowed up in victory. 55 Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?'   I don't like how Paul writes. His stuff is always hard for me to make sense out of, and the learning Bible isn't much help.  Not all Christians are going to experience death, but we will all be changed in an instant at the end of the world when Jesus comes back.  He'll sound a trumpet and the people who have died will be raised, and Christians' bodies will change from mortal to immortal.  Then a saying (a prophesy?) will come true, and Christians will be victorious over death.  Death won't be victorious, and will have no sting, because we will have our immortal and imperishable bodies for eternity.  This is like what the pastor was talking about a couple of Sundays ago, about what will happen when Jesus returns.  I didn't realize that was going to result in us having physical bodies in heaven.  I thought it was just a spiritual thing.  I wonder what happens to people who get cremated, then.  I don't guess it matters, though, God can still give them their bodies back.
