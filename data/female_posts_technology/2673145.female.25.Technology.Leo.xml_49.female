Not much excitment since u already know the story. So the good thing about the show is its humour. The lead actor and actress were pretty great. Act well and were funny. And I also impress with how they merge/morph 'cartoon drawings' to real life scenes. I guess since the show has really lean plot, they had to get in famous people.. such as Samo Hong, Olwen Willson and his brother (who's so cuttteee!), Kathy Bates (as Queen Elizabeth), even Richard Brendson(boss of Virgin Co.) had a split second act in it.   I rate this 2.5/5 bcos of Jackie.. don't like him. 8-|
