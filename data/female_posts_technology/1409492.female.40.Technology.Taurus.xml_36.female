Sprinkle on some Kung Fu for extra flavor. Kurt Russell and Dennis Dun make a cute twosome, too.  9:  Ron Livingston and Damian Lewis   urlLink Band of Brothers   Especially Episode 10, where Nixon offers Winters a peace time job at his father's plant. Simply adorable.  8:  Ralph Fiennes and Angela Bassett   urlLink Strange Days   Her brawn and his brain. I wish more movies had this kind of spark between the leads.  7:  Christian Bale and Emily Watson   urlLink Equilibrium   As with 8. the scene where they barely touched fingertips had more electricity than some all-out naked pretzel sex scenes I've seen.  6:  Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas   urlLink Strange Brew   I don't think I have to defend this one.  5:  Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer   urlLink Pulp Fiction   Nor this one.  4:  Tim Roth and Gary Oldman    urlLink Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead   Both of these guys play Evil Bad Guys so much, it was a shock to see them play such sweet, goofball losers. And they are adorable together.  3:  James Marsters and Sarah Michelle Gellar   urlLink Buffy the Vampire Slayer   I should also mention David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson here. The chemistry of both of these couples added a strong layer to both of their respective series. Alyson Hannigan and Alexis Denisoff make an awful cute real-life couple enough to deserve honorable mention.  2:  Chow Yun-Fat and Danny Lee   urlLink The Killer   This movie has been celebrated for its homoerotic undertones, almost to the same point as  the Lord of the Rings  (which I left off the list for being too obvious). Still, thier relationship is wonderfully poignant.  1:  Ben Affleck and Matt Damon   urlLink Dogma   Lots of jokes about these two have all ready been made. I'm not joking though, I think they do their most watchable work opposite each other.  Good Will Hunting  and  Jay and Silent Bob  deserve mention here as well.
