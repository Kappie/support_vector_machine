According to  urlLink American Airlines , it should arrive sometime after 11:30. Dang it, I'm getting all twitchy! I had been playing  urlLink Button Men , but I've caught up on all my open games. If the flight was on time, I would be leaving for the airport soon, but now that would be silly. I suppose I should get myself something to eat. I had been delaying supper with the thought of grabbing a bite together once he arrived.  *sigh*  I'll guess I'll just sit around reading, knitting, and/or websurfing to pass the time.
