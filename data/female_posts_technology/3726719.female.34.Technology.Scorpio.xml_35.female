Evidently I was not all that observant to my surroundings either, because the word "lazy" was thrown at me quite often as a kid.  I heard it in my head last Saturday.  I heard it when I didn't get up before 8 a.m.  I heard it when the cats woke me up and I stayed in bed.  I heard it when I finally got out of bed at noon.  I heard it when I sat on the couch and ate "brunch."  I heard it when I laid on the couch and flipped channels.  I heard it when I didn't take a shower until 6 p.m. that night.  I stomped it out every time I heard it too!!  I am not a lazy person.  I work hard.  I keep my home mostly clean.  I do the dishes, wash the clothes, pay my bills.  I am a very responsible adult.   Who would have imagined that it would take 20 years for me to let myself relax without guilt.    My life is my own and I have every right to be as busy, or as not busy, as I want to be.  It's okay for me to lounge around in my pajamas if I want to.  Yes, I'm working on convincing myself as much as I am just telling you about it.  Turns out I'm pretty good at being lazy when I apply myself!!
