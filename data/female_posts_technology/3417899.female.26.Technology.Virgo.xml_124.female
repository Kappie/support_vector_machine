The impact shocked me for a few seconds while the realization of what happened cristalized: a suitcase had fallen from the overhead compartment - right on my face. I could feel one side of my nose swelling, and a scratch near the corner of my eye burning.   For a few seconds I held my face - almost as if I was afraid to take my hands off. I heard someone mumble "oh..shit"... I waitied a few seconds for my eyes to stop burning, then I took my hands away, mumbling "I'm fine, I'm ok"... I was almost expecting a crowd on people boarding the plane to be looking at me, expecting to see if I was ok (too much to expect?) - I was certainly expecting whoever caused the accident to be around apologizing for what he/she had done and making sure I was fine. Neither was true. (I wonder what stung more - the pain of a 22" carry-on suitcase hitting my face or the fact no one bothered to see what damage was caused and if I was ok).  Aside from the pain, I was also worried about my looks. I know, I am vain. (Well, to my defense, I have meetings lined up all week and I don't want a huge purple mark on my cheek, a swollen nose or a gash near my eye).   I went up to the stewardess and asked for some ice to minimize swelling and told her what happened. And yes, I shed a few tears. What? It hurt! I saw myself in the mirror and shed a few more tears over the bump that was forming on my forehead and on my nose.  It's been a few hours now, the swelling has subsided (although I still have some ugly reddish marks on my face) and my bruised ego is back to normal.  Another stewardess has taken down my details as she needs to file a "security report" for the airline (strange... what for? in case I sue? could I sue?).   I look around the people sitting near me - which one of them was the one? How could someone just drop a suitcase on somebody's face and then just walk away as if nothing had happened? Don't people have a snse of decency anymore? A simple " I'm sorry "...? Feels like freakin; New York.
