Salah Abboud al-Jabouri is known to have  urlLink served as governor of Anbar province under Saddam and was a senior commander in Saddam's military.   The Fallujah Protective Army is expected to keep Fallujan insurgents in check.   urlLink Back to Iraq  has as comprehensive a post as any other news outlet, best i read.  Footnotes  1). US administrative references to armed opposition has shifted from phrases implicating the former Baath party; "remnants of Baathist Regime" to; "Insurgents". Previous ascertains that fighting was occurring between (liberating) US forces and (resisting) remnants of Saddam's army are now thrown into a questionable gloom. Former members of Saddam's army have now been recruited to engage in battle with, um, former members of Saddam's army.  2). Some Iraq bloggers earlier this week have already expressed reservations re re-baathification.  3). Reasons for going to war. Checklist.  ~  WMD; none found, so far. ~  Regime change; regime re-installation, as of April 2004, commencing Fallujah. ~  War on Terror; very successful, top marks, war now in full swing.  Update;   urlLink war now in full swing.  More  urlLink headlines.   4). Flag ~ flagging.  5). Iraqi POW's ~ can of worms. Prediction; will try to find person with can-opener and hold accountable for as many PR failures as possible.  6). Not a very good month.
