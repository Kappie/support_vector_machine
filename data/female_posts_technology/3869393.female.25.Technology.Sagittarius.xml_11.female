Belief : This is not blind belief but a belief which comes out of understanding the person to the extent that there should not be a reason for the other partner to even wonder if there is an underlying meaning to something and takes things at face value.  3.  Ego : If there is an ego in any relationship between two people, only one thing can be a sure thing in this....the relationship is heading straight down the drain.  In a relationship, the mere thought of an ego cannot exist and one needs to bare their soul to the other person.  One can never think in terms of "I", every thought has to be "us" or "we"!  4.  Boundaries : Boundaries fix the end point of your relationship.  Love is boundless, so by putting a boundary for the same or a timeline, one would be curtailing their feelings and allowing time to take a precedence over love.  5.  Past : Past plays a very important role in any relationship.  One needs to make peace with their past before moving to any other relationship.  Without accepting one's past, one always carries the baggage forward and messed the forthcoming relationships.  Then comes the comparision factor, which wrecks any relationship.  Each case is as unique as a finger print.  Comparision will only bring to light the strains of the past.  6.  Time out/ Breaks : This can be a plus as well as a minus in a relationship.  Minus in the sense that people make misuse this time to check out other options and then take a call on the current relationship.  This in reality does not help, but infact confuses the situation and adds a new dimension to ones' already confused mind and soul!  The plus of taking a break/ break, allows one to take a step back and understand the beauty of the relationship.  One never understands the beauty of a relationship while in it, its only when one takes a step back/ out and looks at things from an outsider perspective does one feel ready to accept the pitfalls and the compromises both partners have made towards the relationship.  7.  Coaching : As strange as it may sound, coaching is an essential part of a relationship.  Without the process of continous learning in the relationship, the excitement in the relationship is lost and what one has is just two people trying to cling onto each other because they are not prepared to let go and give each other space to understand themselves and their partner.  Coaching becomes extremely important in a relationship especially when the relationship is moving through a period of turbulence.  It is in period of turbulence that one should not take a decision to step away from the situation, but instead try to guide the other person to the shores close by.  This process of marooning a person in the time of need, infact turns out to be the first steps of moving away from the partner. The relationship needs to be given the time and space to grow, after all its' like a baby which needs to sit up, then have a steady head, then turn over, then crawl, stand, walk, etc.  Each step has an unique joy and moving thro' each level is what brings the two people together.  8.  Anger  Aggression : When one is trying to work towards building a relationship, being aggressive and trying to force an issue will never help.  There is a saying, "time and tide waits for none", exactly on those lines, when one tries to shift gears in a relationship before it is ready to move to the next level, the relationship heads no where, and infact move down a gear in reality.  Controlled aggression is the way to building a relationship.  Anger will never help in exhausting the pain, its only sweet words or atleast words said in a diplomatic manner which will help.  A person blinded by anger never gets to understand the true meaning of ones' thoughts, and as result never conveys the meaning which is actually intended.  As a result, all the good thoughts and intentions, goes down the drain!  9.  Commitment  Consistency : This is an important key to unlock the box of happiness in any relationship.  Once this is broken, there is not a locksmith in the world which can find a key to match that particular lock.  Unflinching commitment, even in the worst of the circumstances is what gives belief to one's partner and more than anything makes one's partner actually show more love and affection towards them.  One has to stay consistent in a relationship.  In a relationship between two people where there is no blood relationship, its the words and actions which bind the two people together.   Words and actions once executed will always leave their scars on a relationship, atleast in the subconscious mind.  10.  Respect : The most important aspect of any relationship is the respect which the concerned have for each other.  Respect governs the heart and soul. Respect is the corner stone, once lost, takes a very long time to be earned!  I personally believe that relationship between two people who are not connected by a blood relationship is always a fragile one.  Without a good understanding of ones' partner on a deeper and not superficial level, the relationship has no binding at all.    Any building needs a strong foundation......no use of having the strongest pillars, best of the concrete, best of the architectural designs.......reinforcements will never help!
