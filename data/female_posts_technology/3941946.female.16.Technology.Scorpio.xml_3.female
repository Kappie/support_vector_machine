I wonder how long will god be able to give me an opportunity to basically breathe.. talking about death scares me coz, perhaps i'm afraid of dying, maybe becoz i have not achieved what i want in life and if i were to live for just a while, then i earn nuhting and i'll got to hell. i dont want to go to hell. but anyway even if i die today, or while i'm typing this, who cares. heh. guess what? i shaved both sides of ma side hair and i look like shit.shit happens. basically what i typed today and now is just shit. i miss my mother. well when she's around i rarely cherished her. talked to zach on the phone and we had a bloody looong talk, he's ma bro. zach told me he wanted to just give away 50 bux for ma books but nah, buat ape nak susah kan member, i'm pawning one of ma ring, limit2 dapat gak bayar buku, beli extra pe shirt ke... bleh gak beli specs. hah, dream and dream. ni lah kehidopan, either u want to believe in ur dreams or not. i write quite long today eh? biaselah kalau orang dah merepek they can go on and on and on.. yeh.. bottomline:shit happens but u got to runaway from it by building dreams. paham? k, detailed eh, its like u got to have a dream, be it yg munasabah atau yg tak munasabah(tapi jgn jadi pantat..dream to make love with beyonce tu bukan dream bodoh..) dream to achieve something secretlie or openly and then u'll just work for it. my dreams? heh. i'll update in ma next entry. so see u soon.
