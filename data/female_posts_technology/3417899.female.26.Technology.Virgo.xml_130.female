An article in today's Yedioth Ahronot newspaper refers to the book and quotes from it - while reiterating some of the discrepancies I found so unsettling when I was reading the book.   Here's what Mr. Moore had to say (in the book) about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and his proposed solution:   1. Congress should inform Israel that it has thirty days to end the bloodshed in its/our name- or we cut off the entire $3 billion. Individual terrorism is bad enough, but state-sponsored terrorism is truly evil. I understand that the world will always have the occasional lone crazy with grievances he feels compelled to avenge with violence. But for the Israelis, a group otherwise good and intelligent people, to collectively enforce a system of terror against another group simply because of their race or religion is unconscionable. And you and I and millions of other taxpaying Americans put up the money for Israels unconscionable actions- actions that could not exist if each of us wasnt having 4 cents taken from out paychecks today and every day to buy bullets that go into the Israeli guns that kill the Palestinian children.   2. If it wants to keep receiving our tax dollars, Israel should be given a year to work out a plan with the Palestinians to create a nation called Palestine (formed from the West Bank, Gaza, and some strip of land that connects them). This new nation of Palestine must then present a Constitution that not only prohibits any form of aggression against Israel but also guarantees full democratic rights to every Palestinian man, woman, and child.   3. The United States will then give Palestine DOUBLE what it has given Israel in funding (for a permanent peace, Id gladly give up my portion of this- pennies a week). This is not free cash for corrupt public officials like the ones we have in our country. This is Marshall Plan-style direct aid that builds roads, schools, and industries that provide decent-paying jobs.   In his open letter to Arafat - Mr. Moore reflects on the "fact" that 1 million Jews, representing 1/3 of the Israeli population, had recently participated in rallies for peace and in support of Arafat.  He also refers to the "fact" that if the Palestinians were to go on strike, the Israeli government were to fall on it's knees as it is dependent on Palestinian cheap labor.   Many readers, magazines, and TV anchors have commented on this - and while the opinions are divided amongst those who support these ideas and those who don't - the majority seemed to think some of this was feasible.   Does anybody else care that  the facts  in his book don't make sense? As Yedioth Ahronot correctly pointed out: There was never a rally with 1 million participants in Israel. 1 Million is not one third of the population. When the book was written the number of Palestinians working in Israel was very minimal and close to none - certainly not enough to "bring the government to it's knees".   How am I supposed to watch a so-called documentary, so praised by everybody, when I know this guy makes up whatever facts are convenient for his story to make a point?
