There might not be enough room for that many folks but there's enough work for it.  I'll be calling in dead instead of tired soon cause I'm just beat tired.  So I'll call in dead. LOL  Hence the plan. hehe  Plan:  work slow.  Be behind in almost everything.  Terrible I know but I have to do something during this growth spurt.  I'm done ranting again about that place.  John was sweet enough to call and join him and others to see The Village.  Not as spooky as I would have thought or seen in all the previews.  There were surprises tho.  The exposition is towards the end of the film, which is very different from others; similar to Sixth Sense. (Not seen signs so I can really say.)  The only thing I can say that won't spoil it - Adrian Brody plays a great nut case.  Seeing Little Black Book tonight.  Ron Livingston is in this one.  He's hot, in my opinion.  Enough rant - question time:  If you were terminally ill, would you stay were you are, deal w/ the treatments or move to be isolated?
