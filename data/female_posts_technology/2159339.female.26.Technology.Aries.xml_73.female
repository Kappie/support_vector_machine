TFF are an acoustic duo comprised of two scrawny tall-and-skinny-white-boys with charmingly crooked teeth. They play country-ish music and harmonize in soft voices like The Kings of Convenience. The guy on the left had longish stringy hair and wore a beat-up trucker hat, old tattered clothes, and worn-in cowboy boots. I couldn't tell if he was a country-tinged hipster from Oakland or a real deal Southern boy. His face and his character lacked hipster self-satisfied irony and smugness. His dress did not seem studied and their music wasn't tongue-in-cheek or contrived hee-haw country, but simple and sincere. Another charming thing about them was when the guy on the right would mess up on his guitar parts and grin in embarrassment.   After their set I bought a CD from the guy on the left and asked, "Where are you guys from?" and he said, "Oakland." And I said, "I was wondering whether you guys were from: Oakland or the South." And he said, "Well, I'm originally from Nashville and Nick's from Albuquerque, but we're in Oakland now."  Their CD cost $3 and it's well-worth it for its DIY whimsy. The holder is half of a taped-up envelope and on the back the song titles are handwritten. On the front is an authentic old-timey black-and-white photograph secured with photo corners. Each CD has a different picture. Dude-on-the-left asked me which picture I wanted, and I said, "I want one with someone wearing old-timey glasses!" He flipped through all of them and gave me one that had a bespectacled dad playing with a baby.
