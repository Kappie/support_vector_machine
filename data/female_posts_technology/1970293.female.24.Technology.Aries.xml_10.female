You are a friend in times of need, a lover when I need you most, a provider for your family, a husband to keep me safe, a father for your adoring baby, a man for the woman in me, an adviser  when I need advice, my rock when I need strength, my tree when I need roots, my wizard when I need magic, my jester when I need a laugh, my future when I need hope, and my dream when I am asleep.  You are my everything.  When times  get tough, and  you had enough, please remember these words I say to you:  I pledge to you as on our wedding day my living and dying, I shield your back as you would mine, your name is the name I cry in the night,  and your eyes  I smile into in the morning  I pledge to you the first of my meat  and my drink the honeycomb  will taste sweeter, coming from my fingers.  I shall not disparage you nor you me,  and I shall honor you above all others, telling no strangers of our quarrels.  In times of heated discussion, I will try to hold my temper, as I hope you will too.  This is our vow to each other forevermore.  Always my love,  my darling.
