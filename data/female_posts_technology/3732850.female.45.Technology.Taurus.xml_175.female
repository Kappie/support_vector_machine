This girlfriend and I had a relationship for five years and we were very committed to one another.  Eventually, I ended up taking a job in St. Paul and because of this I was forced to move. Our relationship continued for many months after, but it was very hard. We only got to see each other on the weekends so we always made the most of it. We would go shopping and out to eat all the time. On many of these ocassions I purchased things  for my new apartment. I still have many of them to this day.  One such purchase was a hollowed out clay cowboy boot, my girlfriend helped me find the right fake flower arrangement to put inside. I still think of her everytime I look at it. I can still picture her arranging the flowers.
