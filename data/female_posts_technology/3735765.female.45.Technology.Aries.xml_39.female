Anyhow, they told us about how my brother had taken her to the prom in High School...and about 12 years later, they are happening to meet up with one another once again.  Who would have thought that someone who lives in NY could meet up with this TX gal after not seeing her for more than 12 years?  It must be fate.    The sparkles in their eyes, the friendly banter they had going, the caring actions they did for one another was fabulously grand and, hopefully (don't want to jinx them though) this might lead on to a longer relationship???? Only time will tell.  In the meantime, I am keeping my fingers crossed....they are such a cute couple.
