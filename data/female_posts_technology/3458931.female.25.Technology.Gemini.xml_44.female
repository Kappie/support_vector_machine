We met at a Saint Cinnamon downtown; there was live music there too so that was cool. I delicately picked at a cinnamon bun with a fork while he sipped on a coffee and we chatted about various topics. I think I did most of the talking, but then I don't think there would have been any conversation if I didn't. He seemed nice enough, and knew a few people that I also know, and he had a nice smile. On the downside he didn't seem to have an opinion about anything, or have any passions...maybe I just didn't find the right topic. Anyway it might be nice to catch a movie or some pool with him sometime.   Now here's my dilemna, what is supposed to occur at the end of a first date? Does the no kissing rule still apply? Should there be a handshake or something? I ended up just kinda staring at my feet for a minute and then turned on my heels and walked to my car. I'm not sure if that was the right thing to do? Anyway he's still talking to me so I couldn't have done THAT bad.
