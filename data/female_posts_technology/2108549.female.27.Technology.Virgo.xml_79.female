And even better to get out of the shower into big fluffy new towels!    This weekend I am hanging curtains and curtain rods, getting an alarm installed in my truck and unpacking.  Uneventful to some but fun to me. Hopefully I'll even get a working phone line.  Doubtful but I haven't given up hope yet!
