Now my husband is a great sneezer.  He must have sneezed 30 freaking times last night.  I ignored him, or tried to.  But 30 sneezes is hard to ignore.    When i came in to work this morning, B starts going on about calling in sick together again.  I give him a look and he follows it with admission he probably won't do it.  Whatever.  I've only got today and tomorrow to tackle until the weekend.    Very happy with myself.  Am now ready to do my first two labs for school having finished the first set of objectives last night.  Felt very productive.    Disappointed my friend Tony again for forgetting a DVD he's been bugging me to bring.  Sorry, Tony!  Will/must remember to bring it for our dinner tomorrow night.  Must dust, vaccuum (sp?), and do the laundry before next week.  Hope my laziness won't kick in again and leave them all undone.    Oh and internet connection is now up at home!    -
