I went out to dinner with my family, and ordered salmon. No appetizer, no alcohol. But then.... dessert.  Oh dear god. I don't know why I ordered it, I didn't really want it, but for some reason, eating chocolate mousse cake seemed like an easy way to make the family time pass, lol.  It even had whipped cream with it guys, and I ate every last bite. I tried to make up for it by going to the gym, but somehow I don't think half an hour on the eliptical burned that bugger off. After I ate it, I was like, "why did I even do that, I feel gross and bloated." Lesson learned, I guess.      So today I'm going to the gym again, and I'm going to try and get some weights in as well. I'm so tired though, that I might not want to stay that long.       This has nothing to do with this, but I would like to point out how irritated I am at the fact that there is no hot water in my building again today for the SECOND day in a row. I had to bathe with boiled water like some sort of pioneer. Note to self, shower at the gym tonight.
