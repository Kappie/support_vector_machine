Anyone spoken to Uncle Leong lately?   Well, on my part I've been settling into the new job and now trying to plan my exit strategy.  Seems a bit fast but somehow just can't seem to get used to this environment.    Oh yah.. got a new gmail account as well... 2 weeks ago I was busy clearing up my yahoo email and suddenly I get 100mb free from them and annuder 1gb from gmail.  Anyway if anyone wants one I still have a few invitations left.  Just let me know.
