Ok that's better.  Did everyone have a good weekend?  Do anything exciting?  Watched "13 Going on 30" on Friday, went shopping Saturday.  Saturday night went to a birthday party at which I drank too much.  Sunday slept in, no hangover just exhausted, did laundry, watched some TV and went to bed.  Too late obviously.  That was the extent of my weekend.  Now I need a nap, or another day of weekend.
