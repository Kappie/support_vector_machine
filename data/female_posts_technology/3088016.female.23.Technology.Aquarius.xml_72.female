I do believe that the  urlLink one he found  is, indeed, the camera I fell in love with on the commercial.  The discouraging news is that this camera costs about $500, not the affordable range as I had figured.  I'm certainly not in $500 worth of love, so chances are I won't be buying this thing.  For that kind of money, I want to see Steven Tyler just like the ladies in the commercial did.  I don't know why I had estimated it so cheaply; after all, why would Sony spend all that money to promote their low-end camera?  The good news is that Wayne said today that I can use his sometimes.  Since "sometimes" is all I really need to spend with a camera in tow, this plan works out for me.       Result: I'm giving up on wanting a camera for now.  I've gone through this with laptops, too, and still don't have one.  Maybe next I'll focus my futile attentions on  urlLink XM Radio .
