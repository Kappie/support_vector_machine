It is time, but first I need to explain how Shannon and I met to help a bit w/ this situation.  Shannon and I met under very strange and hurtful circumstances and I always thought if we could build a friendship out of that we would always be friends.  We met at the end of July beginning of August sometime.  I was dating someone who shall remain nameless and he walked in w/ this girl.  Of course my first reaction was (what the f..?) He assured me they were friends from way back and she was having man troubles.  Yeah little ol naive me! The next time I saw her was at this persons show. She came alone so I walked up to her and we started talking.  She was very sweet and we hit it off right away.  Well after many beers and lots of dancing, turns out we were both sleeping w/ him w/ in days of eachother and he was telling each of us the same f.ing stories.  Man it hurt, but for some reason we leaned on eachother and got over it fast.  During the process of all this we found out we had much in common. I realized through all of this that she had been cheating on her now fiance and was still very much hung up on this person, but I was not going to judge her.  She was a great person regardless. (in my eyes anyway) This whole situation pisses me off cause she is upset w/ me cause I lied but she has done it many times to me, friends and her fiance.  When he was on a ski trip she was hangin w/ someone she probably should not have until 4 am and I know if her fiance found out.  (OH SHIT) is all I have to say. Anyway, maybe one day her and I will talk again.  I still love her and want to be her friend  even though others tell me I don't need friends like her and she should have been by my side regardless.  I don't know maybe that is the case, but I still don't hate her.
