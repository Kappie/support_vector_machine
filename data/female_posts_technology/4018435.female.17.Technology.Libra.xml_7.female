I put my online journal here so that people could get a piece of my mind and what's going through it, although I haven't been putting in ANY of my deepest darkest thoughts. Let's start with this. This is for you to read and to keep to yourself. If you have something to say about what i wrote, make sure it wont piss me off.    That's right, the intense dark shadow that I have not seen in a long time is back. For the first time in a very long time i felt it's presence (I don't care if I can't fucking spell). This means that I saw my future again. That's right. It's a future without my dearest friends. Why? Gee...look what's happening. But let's be real. I should be able to cope with the little BS going on around me. I'm usual understanding when it comes to reality. Wait a secong...I'm cracking up. That means I WONT be able to handle diddly squat all right now.  You, you and you! I can't talk to you anymore. No I WONT talk to you anymore because it hurts to talk to people that are a bunch of bullshit liars. IT's one thing to lie, but for crying out loud! WHAT the hell are you peopel doing!? Stay away from me! That's right, I can't handle your crap! "He's not my friend!" my fucking ass. That's exactly why you love talking to him all the time and you care abotu his every fucking oppinion. Uh huh! SURE BUDDY! Oh, what's that? Can't live without me!? FUCK YOU TOO! You're the one that left!  YOU! I CARED FOR YOU! But Nooo you're too fucking special! YOU! You'll never be there for me no matter how much I want and need you to! YOU! I'll never be good enough in your eyes! YOU! You stabbed me in the back! YOU! You're a fucking hipocrit! YOU! I would have been a good friend if you acted like a better one to me! YOU! So what if I don't have a car! I'd walk in the freezing cold to spend time with you! YOU! I stuck up for you! You NEVER stick up for me!  I really can't handle anyone anymore. Like my vision always told me. I'm supposed to get away from it all. No matter what anyone says, I'll be alone and I'll be on my own. That means I'll have to fucking reach my dream by myself. No real support. Can someone please tell me what a friend is!? In the past 3 weeks, I've started hanging out with people I barely know or just met and they've proven to be such great people to everyone; themselves, to me, their friends, their family, strangers! WHAT THE FUCKING HELL! Is there something wrong with me!? YES! My friends are great! But I"M NOT! I'll leave them alone. I'll let them be joined at the hip and let them ignore me without giving them a second thought. FORGET IT! I'll get to the top without anyone!  It's just like i said. I'll dissapear. Someday I'll come back to step on those who crushed me...but what's that!? I believe in karmha! So I CANT step on you! not literally! I'll just crush you but letting you see how I'll be after all of you fucked over my life! I'm tired of helping people! But I can't help it! Do i get anything in return!? Oh sure...lots of stuff, but what about the things that AREN't materialistic! Read that NO MATERIALISTIC friendships.  What the fuck was I thinking!? A thank you dinner for my friends!? WHAT FRIENDS!? Thanking them for what!? Leaving me alone in my thoughts and when I cry or when I need them!? YEAH! Tha;ts what I'm talkin bout! THOSE PEOPLE!  My parents wanna know why I don't wanna celebrate my fucking 18th b'day party!? BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE NO FUCKING POINT!? Who's gonna be there!? My friends don't ask to change their plans to be there for their friends like I do! WHY did I WASTE MY TIME!? No one knows what kind of party I would have wanted. The people i would want to be there wouldn't be there! Maybe they don't exist...maybe that's why they never show up when I need them most...  So I sounds  crazy and fucked up now right? well guess what EXACTLY! Go on with your fucking life without me...wait, why am I telling you this? YOU'll DO IT ANYWAY!  Just make sure you shoot yourself when you see that I get sumwhere sumday and you don't.   There is no such thing as a friend. Only people who play with your mind and emotions. That's right.
