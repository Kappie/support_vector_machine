I go to work feeling shattered. On this day last year everyone is quiet, but for the sound of news presenters and the silent patter of millions of hits on web news sites.  Everyone, everywhere, in every country, city, town and offbeat track is waiting. Some are waiting for their cue. Demonstrations have been organised to synchronise with the day the first bombs fall on Iraq. In something of a ripple effect, a bomb drops on Baghdad and thousands of placards flap across the globe, like butterflies, like migratory birds preparing to take leave, an evacuation of the soul.  On this day last year rationality deserts us, all.   urlLink Radio  in Iraq, about this time last year.  At some stage on this day last year I shuffle through old things, looking for a song, I find it  urlLink Sinead Oconnors Drink before the War   (ever noticed how everyone sings differently those lines "So stop,  something something, something  not gonna  something "? Mine is; "So stop, you bastards are not goin' t' heaven") This time this year I dig out Ben Harper;  Ben Harper Amen Omen  What started as a whisper slowly turned into a scream searching for an answer where the question is unseen  I don't know where you came from and I dont know where u'v gone old friends become old strangers between the darkness and the dawn  Amen omen will I see your face again amen omen can I find the place within to live, my life without you  I still hear you saying all of life, it is chance and is sweetest, is sweetest, when at a glance but I live I live a hundred, a hundred lifetimes in a day but I die a little in every breath that I take  Amen omen will I see your face again amen omen can I find the place within to live my life without you  I listen to a whisper slowly drift away silence is the loudest, parting word, you never say I put, I put your world into my veins and now a voiceless sympathy is all that remains  Amen omen will I see your face again amen omen can I find the place within to live my life, without you  Amen omen will I see your face again amen omen can I see your face again amen omen can I find the strength to live, my life
