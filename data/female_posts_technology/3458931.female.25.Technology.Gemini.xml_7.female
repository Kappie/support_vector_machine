He didn't know if it was really love, and he said he couldn't move our relationship further because he was afraid to. I have a daughter, so I come as a package deal; a ready-made family if you will. That is what he couldn't deal with. He thought it would be better for us if we just ended it now.  He couldn't see himself changing, and didn't think it fair that I be made to wait.  He seemed genuinely distraught during the breakup. I've never in four years seen him cry until then. Though every possible emotion I could have been feeling was hurling through my mind at the time, I remained calm. I tried to understand where he was coming from, what he was feeling. Perhaps I could accept it so easily because it what he was saying was so honest. He said he didn't want to loose me as a friend. I told him he should take some time apart from me and my daughter and focus inward on himself.   So that is where I am now. I guess you could just call it time apart, but it may well turn out to be final. I'm not ready to tell any of my friends or family, even my daughter, that the relationship may be over. Until I am sure things are finished with us I'll journal my thoughts and feelings here.
