She called forth on the gods and the goddesses to do her bidding.  She realized it was wrong to do harm onto another but she felt such hatred and such pain when she looked at him.  She could no longer help herself.   She wanted him to feel pain.  Pain that would last for the rest of his life.    Suddenly she just sighed and threw the energy into the cosmos.  She just couldn't do it.  She was not that sort of person and she never would be.  She combed her brown hair back behind her ears and turned away.  "Wait, Gwen."  A male voice said suddenly behind her.  She turned back to see who called.  It was him.  Oh dear.  Why goddess is he calling for me?  He finished speaking to the other man and walked towards her.  She melted.  Not again.  She couldn't handle this again.   "Where are you going in such a hurry?"  He asked as he slid his arm around her waist and led her away from the room.  "I thought I would leave the room before I became sick and embarrassed myself in front of everyone."  She said bluntly as she tried to slide away from his arm.    "Why do you hate me so much?  You're the greatest thing that has ever happened to me and yet I feel strong emotions coming from you.  I want to feel strong emotions from you but loving ones, my dear."  He said smoothly as he tightened his hold on her.  She knew she was in trouble of falling for him again.  He just had such killer looks.  Looks that any woman in her right mind would fall for.  Dark hair, strong features, strong build, and a rich velvety voice.  She knew it.  She did it again.  She would hate herself later but what could she do?  He was her absolute dream guy.  "Why do you pursue me so much?  I have shown nothing but hatred for you and yet you keep pursuing."  She turned and faced him.  Of course bad idea because now she felt the full force of his charm.    "Because you have my heart and will always have my heart.  I love you for you are the treasure of my life."  He said softely and pulled her into his arms.  "I am sorry for leaving you so long.  I had problems that had to be resolved but I am back now.  I hope that I didn't lose you but can take up where we left off before I left."  "But the rumors said that you left for another woman.  That you didn't know how to get rid of me and just left."  She said quickly not wanting to believe his tale.  "Oh is that what you believe?  Let me tell you that there has not been another woman since I laid eyes on you.  You have stolen everything from me and I am glad of that.  I feel so complete when I am with you.  Those rumors are a lie.  There was trouble on my estate.  My stable caught on fire and I had to over see the cleanup.  Luckily all the horses made it out safely."  He said grimly.  "Oh I am sorry.  I knew I shouldn't have believed those girls."  She said angrily.  "I am glad that you are okay and that your horses made it out safely.   She hugged him tightly as she realized what she almost had done to him.  She had let her emotions get control of her and she knew better than that.  After leaving him until dinner, she strolled around the garden.  Why did she believe those rumors so easily?  Something was afoot.  She noticed one of the girls across the garden.  She strolled over.  "Hello Cynthia."  She said in a nonchalant voice.  "Oh hello Gwen.  Have you heard that he is back?"  Cynthia gushed with unsupressed excitement.  "Oh no is he back."  She pretended to not have seen him yet.  "Oh yes he is.  I heard that he is looking for another woman.  Maybe you should stay out of sight."  she seemed to gush again.  "Strange.  I heard that he had to return to his estate to clean up his stable that had caught on fire."  Gwen said as she picked a pretty blue flower to smell.  "What?  That can't be.  You must have misheard."  Cynthia said quickly.   "Why don't you just stop the act and get away from me?  I no longer want to hear your lies.  I know that one of you girls are jealous of what I have with him and now it is time for you to stop playing your games."  She demanded before flying off toward her room.  Hopefully that will put an end to all the trouble.
