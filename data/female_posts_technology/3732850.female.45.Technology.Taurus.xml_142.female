They must be someones great-grandparents or relative.  The questions that the author asked "who it was that sold a family treasure...?", ".... a relative who can not name the face or family?" were very intriguing and brought even more questions to my mind.  Ithink of my grandmother who has pictures from a hundred years past of her great-grandpartents and those of my grandfather as well when I read this essay. To her the pictures mean so much. Every time that we are together, she has a new picture that she has found or figured out just how they are related to her children and their children. However, I feel callous at times when I am not that interested because I can tie no personal memories or attachments to these people.
