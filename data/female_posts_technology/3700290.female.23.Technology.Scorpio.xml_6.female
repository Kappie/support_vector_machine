I surfed into flowerpod again and surfed into other people's blogs. My heart just raced when I saw the picturesque designs that they had for their own website. It reminded me of my own self a year ago...busy toying up my free site whenever I have the spare time to do so....   It seems that these days I am too engrossed in studying that I forgot this passion of mine. I realized that I still like web-designing very much though I am not very good in it. I conclude I am an introvert..and a homely person. I don't need to talk much...except that I always need to get my hands or brains moving. You can easily see my confession from my interests: web-designing, maths, cleaning up my room, photography, reading, surfing the site and watching tv...hahah   Talking about TV dramas, I simply love to watch TCS 8 9 pm show...tian yan mi yu...nice nice...The serials is very sweet and for the first time, I love Fiona Xie's acting. Well, in factit is the show thatI form a better impression of her. I love her haircut, her clothings and last but not least, to be the blessed girl in the show. Isn't it fortunate for her to have threeadmirers showering with loveand at the same time, have a virtuous mother to care for her?   *Smacks* Janet! You should wake up from your daydreaming and start revising!
