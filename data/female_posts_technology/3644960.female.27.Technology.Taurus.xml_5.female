     
      Some days there are just too many disconnected thoughts floating between my ears.  I feel as if I may loose some important tidbit of information unless I write them down.  I'm all about lists, a wishlist for books I want to read, a list of places I want to see in my life, a grocery list.  This blog is my laundry list of lists.  I feel an innate need to share my thoughts with others.  To somehow validate and record my ideas on the off chance that there is someone out there who can find a use for them.   This blog is my way of appeasing the voices in my head.  The voices whose life's goal is to be shared with others.
