Yes, my husband and I have just purchased our first home.  And with that comes the anticipation and excitement of finally being able to make something our own.  However, the dread and fear of packing also rears its ugly little head.   I really shouldn't complain.  It is truly a privilege to be in a situation where you can buy your own home.  And, the new methods out there are fantastic...no need to have that huge bulk of money saved up anymore, provided you're not a credit risk!!  But the waiting...Oh! the waiting!  And again, I shouldn't complain, but I am so anxious and excited to get back into the house and see what it looks like.  I truly can't remember!  Our possession date is July 15, which isn't far away, considering as how we closed the deal last week.  But I've got so many plans for the house!  I suppose it could be a case of "cart before the horse" syndrome.  Before I go and buy the paint and picture myself living in a dream home, designed the way my husband and I want it to be, I need to finish the packing, and prepare for the move.  My husband, David, works night shifts.  I suppose it would be fair for me to say that I've got big plans for him when he wakes up.  Poor boy!!  Well, I'd best close.  Things to do!  -J.
