In an attempt to compensate for the over-convergence thing going on with my eyes, Walter (Dr. Choate to those who haven't been going to him for 16 years now) has put me in a bifocal contact lens. Yes, I'm feeling old as the hills. Since I'm not a candidate for the muscular surgery (eyes are not actually crossing, just working like they are), we have to adjust and compensate for the over-convergence in order to prevent the double vision.  So, these new lenses have the distance correction I need, and a little bit of reading assistance. I'm trying to adjust. The right eye is not as sharp as it was. I'm not having double vision either, so that's good. I go back in a few weeks for a check up and a further plan of attack. I'll keep you posted.  Which brings me to the laws of attraction. Even with the new lenses, my ability to see a person and feel/or not feel an attraction factor hasn't changed. Where does it start? Is attraction learned as we grow up, or are we born with an instinct for what's pleasing to our eyes? What maks a person that upon initial meeting is simply plain, and later becomes an attractant? Are we wrong to keep searching for that image that sparks our passion? Or is it better to get to know someone and let the attraction build?  And why is it that for the most part the people attracted to us, we are not attracted to in return? And do the "beautiful people" have depth of soul and character?  I ramble on this topic because of the men I've met lately, none has sparked my attraction. They have all been very nice. Easy to talk to....okay I could talk to a light post. There's just no giddy excitement. You know what I'm talking about. The kind that makes you smile a lot, and all "shaky/tingly" on the inside. While I think I've got the potential for some good friends, I don't feel drawn to anyone as a potential lover. There are 2 men I would like to imagine kissing a lot - neither one of them is interested in me. Sigh. It's aggrevating.  I wonder if I'm looking for too much. I wonder if I'm just being shallow. Okay so I'm not being as shallow as the roommate...he won't even hang out with the women if their butt is too big.....I'll at least still go hiking or to a movie with the guys. I'd like to look forward to spending some time with someone....not just resigned to "it's better than hanging out by myself." When I'm like that, it really is better to hang out by myself.  So I'm continuing to meet and talk to new people. Hoping to meet the next person to make me gulp and my heart to skip a beat. I think Mr. B set a bad precedence. Is it too much to ask that I meet another great love of my life!?!?!?
