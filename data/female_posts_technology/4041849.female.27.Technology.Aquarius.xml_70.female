DID I LOOK DESPERATE? even if i did need help, what did he think he was going to do? damn. i should've told him i needed to pick my mom up in chino hills and could he please pick her up for me. that miserable little fuck. i hate old guys. anyway, i told him, "no. i'm waiting for my ride. thanks." (damn, i even said THANKS! that's big for me.) anyway, the asshole actually looked disappointed. what a jerk. he waited around for what felt like 5 minutes. it was prolly only 10 seconds, but when someone is just sitting in their car staring at you, it feels like forever... and then he drove away finally....  now, in all fairness, i'm sure he was just trying to be nice... and he doesn't know what a bitch i am... so he probably thought he was doing the right thing... but, i was certain i wasn't giving off that whole damsel in distress vibe... and i don't need his fucking charity. i don't know why it bugged me so damned much. it just did. i hate people.
