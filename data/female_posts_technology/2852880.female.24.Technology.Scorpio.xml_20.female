Then I drank a little more than I should have, but not enough to forget that I was pretty much on my own at The Ballroom in Fremont.  Not a place where you want to be on your own.  Everyone pretty much coupled off and I tried to be cool about it.  I sort of went into the dance floor and danced by myself a little bit.  But that's kind of depressing. So I got another drink since drinking kind of occupies you for a little, but I knew I had too much so I switched to water.  I was no knowing at all what to do with myself when this guy kind of did the little head tilt towards the dance floor.  He looked harmless enough, so I shrugged and went in to dance.  It's nice to feel wanted.  Coincidentally, his name was Angel.  A little angel being sent to make me feel better.  After a few songs we went our separate ways back out to the bar area, where I was once again all by my lonesome.  I realized I was having negative fun, so I headed for the door.  I was feeling a little bad about not saying goodbye to anyone I came with.  Lucky enough, I passed one of them getting a drink and told him I was on my way out.  He didn't seem to upset about me leaving.  :-)  Anyways, I went home and threw up all my alcohol and went to bed.  I was still really hungover in the morning.  Today I found out that somebody egged my car.  This is the second time in like 3 months.  I wonder if I did something mean to somebody in my apartment building without knowing it.  I hope not.  I'm going to report it to the building manager this time.    Three weeks into my pilates workout program and I seem to have gained an inch on my waist.  I have lost 4 pounds, though.  I'm not sure what's going on.  I think it might be the pizza and chips.   I hope to figure out my life in the next few weeks.  That's a pretty big thing to do.  I think I just need to commit to something and let myself go along for the ride.  I'm seeing B on Friday.  We're going to Blue Man Group.  I'm so psyched!  I'm going to bring my new fancy purse.  --K
