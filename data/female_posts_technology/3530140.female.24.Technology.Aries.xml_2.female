I was engrossed in CNN Saturday afternoon as White House correspondent after correspondent recalled their memories of him. I was touched. I didn't even know him, yet there was something about him that hit home.  He was the first president I recognized and admired. This is not because I knew what voodoo economics meant at the age of 6 but because he held a position of influence and in a way, reminded me of my grandfather. Reagan had amazing charisma, contagious charm, and added a political flavor as an American Cowboy -- the heroic definition of good vs. evil. At the end of his days, I'm sure all of those memories were unreachable to him. Sad.  Perhaps that is what bothers me most. My grandpa forgets things from time to time. We all do and it doesn't get any better the older we get. I realized about a year ago, how little I actually knew of the history of both sets of grandparents and even my parents. You hear stories as you grow up, but half listen. They seem to mean more now. I sometimes worry that I won't have enough time to collect those stories and ask questions. It's a valuable resource you can't afford to lose, but often forget you have access to.  I actually have a piece of Reagan memorabilia. My grandparents saw him when he was in North Platte and brought me back a red bandana souvenir. I remember thinking that was the neatest thing in the world. It's a memory that will always link the two together. Maybe it is another reason why I think of Reagan kindly.  Here's to you, Dutch. Your legacy is forever. Warmly, Pinkie
