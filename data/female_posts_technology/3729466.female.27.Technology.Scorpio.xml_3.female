I have been analyzing all I have gone through with my friend and my boyfriend and I believe I have learned a big lesson. I have learned that keeping my mouth shut is the best thing I can do. Being quiet will bring me to success. Being quiet will make my life better. This blog is helping me to succeed in keeping my mouth shut. I am not telling people I know about my life; I am telling to a diary, a diary that doesn't know me. So, whomever reads this won't really bother me because I don't know the person nor the person knows me.  Anyway, it is Friday and the weekend is here. I have a bunch of work to do this weekend. I am taking Summer classes and it sucks! Time is too short and I can't get most of my work done! But after I graduate in December, things will be much better! I can't wait.
