After driving for 22 (plus vat) years secondhand cars that I keep for ages and ages (this one 6 years, one before 11 years) I was quite giddy when my husband agreed to let me have one with only minimal nagging.    On the other hand, what the hell have I done? Why have I committed to spend so much of my hard earned dosh when my other car was perfectly fine, old, admittedly, but fine.     The ashtray wasn't even full.
