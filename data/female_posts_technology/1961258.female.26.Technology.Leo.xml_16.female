I feel better about myself since I'm not snacking all the time on junk food or whatever. Although the meals today make me feel like a bad day, they are normal by everyone else's standards but I don't feel right eating 'so much'.   Lunch (4pm)  - rice (1 cup max) with sambal, 1/4 egg + choc milk  Tea (5 - 6pm)  - roti canai with kurma  Dinner (9 pm)  - pizza, 9" or 12" thin/homemade crust .. chicken  garlic (3 slices of varying size) - Coke (1 can)  Snacks (after 10pm)  - chocolates (4 cubes of Swedish choc) - Mentos (some) - Digestives biscuit (1)  The pizza thing at the end of the day was a little overboard .. 3 slices but at the very least they were NOT Pizza Hut sized. And the chocolates .. hmm ...   I weighed myself this morning and the old scale said 167 - 168lbs which is amazing. The digital scale says 77.1 - 77.2kg which is around there or 170lbs (depends whether it's 2.14 lbs or 2.2 lbs per 1 kg). I am so happy to be BELOW 170! Now my next mini goal is 160lbs by the end of May. It's quite a lot, but I think I can do it!
