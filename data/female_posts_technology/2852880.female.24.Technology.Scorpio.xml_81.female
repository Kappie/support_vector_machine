I've seen it on commercials a lot lately. It's this shaving gel called  urlLink Veet , and you use a razor-shaped piece of plastic that has no blade. It cost less than $10 so I figured, why not. I find shaving to be really annoying, so maybe this would be better.    Well, first I check the ingredients and #2 is urea. Yuck! Whose?! I read the precautions and it says " Failure to follow use directions and precautions may result in chemical burns. " Ok...but now I paid money for this stuff so I decide to trudge on. It says to do it inside an empty tub to avoid spillage on carpet or clothing. Geez. You're supposed to try a patch out and wait 24 hours to make sure you don't have any allergic reactions, but who wants to wait that long? So I spread the gel as evenly as possible on both legs. It says to wash hands immediately afterwards. I'm a little freaked out as it is, and my hands are starting to tingle so I don't really get as much gel on as I wanted, but I move to the handwashing phase. Now you leave it on for 3 minutes. But how much time did I spend washing my hands? I decide to wait 2 minutes 30 seconds. Then you're supposed to try a spot and see if the hair removes. I try and no dice. Then I realize, I did the other leg first, so I try that, and it works. Sort of. I work on that leg and realize it's taking me a long time. Uh-oh. It says all over the bottle  DO NOT EXCEED 8 MINUTES . Now I'm frantically fake-shaving this gel off. I miss lots of spots. Hair is sort of coming off. Time is ticking away. My legs feel kind of weird and I decide to bail out and turn on the shower. It doesn't seem to rinse off. There's still a film on my legs. I try soap. More soap. Eventually I just dried them. Now I'm not  allowed to swim, sunbathe, or use astringent lotion for 24 hours . This is INSANE. I'm supposed to wear a short skirt tonight. Ack!  I'm going to have to put the Veet away with the other nightmare products such as Instead. They should really put a message on the label that says " Not for paranoid people. "
