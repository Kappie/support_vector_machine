He's so funny and charming and full of good vibes and just an unparalleled raconteur. He came out with an acoustic guitar and a bright red sari-like scarf draped around his shoulders. He sang a tune, then told a story about how Mike Watt, who is currently playing with the Stooges, was told by Iggy Pop that he couldn't wear flannel if he was going to play in the Stooges. Mike Watt says what should I wear then? and Iggy goes do it like I do, go shirtless and Mike Watt says I haven't played shirtless since '81 but he decides to do it anyway. And Ben Lee says if Mike Watt can do it, so can I, and he puts down his guitar and takes off his shirt. Then he wraps the sari around his shoulders again which covers himself up almost completely, picks up his guitar, and proceeds to play.  He was joined by a sweet-looking gal named Lara on keyboards/bass and Jason Schwartzman of "Rushmore"/ Phantom Planet fame. I know earlier that I've stated that Jason Schwartman is a fugly dude, but I'd like to take this opportunity to rescind that statement. His characters onscreen are detestable, but in person, he's a wonder and kinda cute. He alternated between the keyboards, bass, and drums and was a non-spotlight-hoggy guy, not saying much and hiding under his green baseball cap. And when he drummed, he'd do that cool drumstick twirly-spinny move even though he was playing with  urlLink splashsticks .  Mid-set Lara prompted Ben to "Make [Jason] laugh!" and Ben started strumming his guitar and singing:  We've been on the run/ Driving in the sun/ Looking out for #1/ California here we come/ Right back where we started from/  And Jason hid beneath his hat, embarrassed, while I cheered, because he was singing "California" by Jason's ex-band, Phantom Planet. It's also the theme song to "The OC." But enough with starstruckness, Ben put on a great show and he played a lot of songs from his first album, including two of my favorites, "Away With the Pixies" and "Pop Queen". In all the shows that I've seen him play starting from, like, '95, he has NEVER played "Away With the Pixies." It was a real treat.   The opener was Sean Hayes, who I assumed was the actor who plays "Jack" from Will and Grace, but he's actually a local folkie-Americana singer-songwriter. Same name, different guy. He was good, but didn't appeal to me. He was neither painful nor delightful.
