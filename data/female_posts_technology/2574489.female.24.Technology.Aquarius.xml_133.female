I got bitten by fire ants, got my skin torn off, all on the same foot. I skinned my elbows. I found out that I am not as fearless as I used to be when sliding down slides, jumping off diving boards and swinging off bars.  But boy, did I had a great time!   Saturday night, we got invited to go Sunday to a local lake.  Woody and I hemmed and hawed and I'm not sure why. Maybe because we liked having our weekends planned and we had planned to stay in and do nothing?  Then we reasoned, why do the same old thing?  So Sunday morning we got hot dogs and hot dog buns,chips, drinks and paper plates and cups and a tube of sunblock.  We were going to get some sun!  We had a great time with our friends. I got what I called a "pre-tan". Not quite a tan. We gorged on burgers (our friends brought them), among other things.  I overcame my fear of this bar that swung over the lake and that people jumped off of.  Okay, it took a lot of convincing, and of a kid coming by saying even his four year-old brother could do it, but I did it too!
