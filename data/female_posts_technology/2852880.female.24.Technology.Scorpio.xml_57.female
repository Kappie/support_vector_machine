It was so much fun, the story was good, and the kids clapped at the end of the chapter.  They all said Ew! and Yuck! at a part when something was "as red as blood."  It was great!  I got a new look from blogger.  What do you think?  I switched comments to use the ones that come with blogger, so I no longer publish the old ones, but I might find a way to get them back.
