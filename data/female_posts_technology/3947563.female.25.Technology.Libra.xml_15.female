Not too bad, but after that I fell asleep so there wasn't really much of a workout yesterday.  Today, I didn't eat breakfast, had a shake for lunch, ate an apple, and then for dinner had tuna,(no mayo), salad, lite cottage cheese, and some melba toast. Then later I had some more melba toast and some grapes and strawberries. Unfortunately, after that, I again got taken in. By a square of leftover pizza. Still, all things considered, it could be MUCH worse. I squeezed in an hour long workout - Sweatin' to the Oldies,lol - and had no coffee.   However, my less than perfect feeling comes from the fact that today I went to buy a bathing suit, and had to buy it from the  plus sized section . That is the first time I have ever had to buy a plus sized anything, and it was not a good feeling. Up until now I've been holding out that I am the only one who sees my chub. Apparently the good people at Wal-Mart see it too.  My boyfriend called earlier from Blockbuster, and asked if he should get candy, and I had to remind him that I was on a diet for the millionth time. Now he just came in, and put an Oreo ice cream sandwich in front of me! He says "Oh go ahead, have it." GRRRR. I got this body by 'Oh, go ahead, have it.'  Hey, I made him put it away though. So help me, I will not eat that thing, even if it means I have to throw it off the balcony. Wish me luck...
