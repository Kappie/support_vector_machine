For a person who didn't keep a diary for the fear of someone finding out what really went through my head this my friend, is a big step.  Looks good so far. Spent ages picking out colors...(whaaaaaaat?!) and other 'useful' things like picking a nice title for the blog(typical fears of being associated with an 'uncool' blog title..:D...HEY! atleast I'm honest...sniff)....but then again that would totally depend on one's definition of 'cool'...  Ever watched 'ewoks'?...one of my favorite cartoons. Worshipped wicket and totally identified self with Kneesa....and for those of you who know me personally..NO the physical aspects have nothing in common...(HUMPF!)...  Just recovered from a very bad bout of illness and am a shadow of my former self!...In addition I was victim to a certain 'accident' that left my nose in need of plastic surgery....sniff! <ouch>....(naah...it's fine...just hurts when I twitch my nose..<ouch>...shouldn't do that)...so there...that my friends has been the kind of luck I have been experiencing. But did I cry?! did I fall!!? did I scream "kill me now and put me out of my misery??!(yes)....NO!...I hung in there,sipped my 'jeevani', rubbed my nose and said "Bring it on!"....  So there...!!
