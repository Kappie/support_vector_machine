We were quite surprised that it took us 6 hours when it was only 4 hours when we took the bus and ferry afterwards. It was a rather tiring journey, contrary to what we thought. Lucky we popped the sea sick pills.   We can't do much after we checked in. Most of us were tired. However, time is precious, we immediately went for a game of golf after a 30mins 'power' nap. Usually you require "handicap" or "PC" (provisional cert or card, dont know. haha), but the resort allow non-handicap golfers if you pay RM$30. So I went for the experience. For the record, I've never been on the greens. Have been playing only at the driving range where you just keep hitting balls. And I haven't been to any courses, so it was rather fruitless and tiring 2hours. After that, it is affirmative that I need lessons. Haha.   It was almost 8 when we cleaned ourselves and head out for dinner. I guess it must be the holidays, most of the restaurants at the resort were booked out. So we had to settle for a yucky buffet bbq dinner that cost RM$54 per adult. That night, we plotted to get the 2 kids to sleep early so that the adults can have some booze and card game. It worked!  Day 2 was spent at the pool side and the beach. It was so sunny and hot that we can't stand sun bathing for more then 30mins, lieing still. But we still get a pretty good tan anyhow.. and I'm peeling already (1 wk later). We played pool, cycled, watched the monitor lizards and it's dinner time once again.   We went to the pool one last time on the 3rd day. And spent the rest of the day waiting.. queueing.. sweating. The custom and ferry terminal was so chaotic. There's no proper instructions and they can't speak much English. Lucky we have our BIL (he's a Malaysian-Chinese and speaks fluent Malay). We thot the ferry is due to leave at 2:30, but we board at that time, and depart at 3. Horrible organisation. By the time we reach Singapore, it was quarter past 9.   My poor niece must have been sea sicked. She threw up twice, the 2nd time was when we were waiting in the line to get off the ferry. Her mum was carrying her and none of us had hands to search for plastic/paper bag to contain her puke. Some passenger's luggage was on the aisle and had some of the puke and she went, "my bag!!!" unsympatheically. Some other passenger quickly pass some tissue for us. So kind of her. (She probably know how it's like to be a mother.) When my sis sarcastically offered tissue to the "my bag" lady, she rejected with a sympathetic look after her husband mumbled something to her.    Conclusion, no more long distant ferry trips. And enough of family trips for now.
