He was 'free' again on Saturday, but went away to a bike rally with the mad one (leaving me to suffer motor-mouth all on my own). They returned Sunday lunchtime and then he went out with his 'mates'.  He actually managed a whole 9 hours before he was caught doing exactly the same as before, and he's grounded yet again.  I really don't know how to get through to him to make him realise what a total prat he's being, but while I try to work that one out, if anyone would like to offer me a good price on a secondhand 12 year old I may well consider selling him.
