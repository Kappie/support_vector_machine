My heart is full because of the following reasons:  *It's fun to talk and giggle about boys again! (Thanks booboolina!) *Hapa Hotstuff who is the biggest metrosexual I've ever laid eyes on, smiled at me. I gave him the indifferent-chin-thrust while my face turned red. *Yesterday night, my mom reminded me that she still wants to take me to Argentina this summer! "Make sure you have enough vacation time," she said. *A weekend jaunt to NYC is in the works with Green Marble and quite possibly Dear Abby. *Yesterday night was the first practice of my brand new possible band. Keep your fingers crossed for this one! *Out of the six jobs I applied for, one called me back! Cross your fingers on the other hand!  Jeez louise, I am brimming with exclamation marks. But another thing that makes me feel a load better is XX bashing. This makes me feel most excellent when I ask his close co-workers what went wrong and two of them said separately and with these exact words: "He's a dog." Gross! I had sex with a dog! I accidentally had a beastiality!   I'm so glad I can laugh about it now. The only reason I can laugh is that I deleted him from my IM buddies list. That was the only way he was contacting me. Now, I have barred all contact. Everytime I'd see the window with his name, it was like a heart attack. Could this be the one? The one where he says he's sorry? No, it would always say something anti-climactic like, "Do you have fill-in-the-blank's CD?" Groan. Who needs the undue heart duress? Not I. Everytime he'd IM me, the fluffy world I was regaining would crumble. A mundane question would make me silent and moody and sad again. Who needs that? Not me. Especially not from a nasty mangey dog!
