It took 15 minutes for me to convince the folks at kaiser to give me a goddamn appointment with my incompetent doctor. "Well, how bad IS you breathing problem?"..you can't be serious. Oh, but they are. So while batty jacks off and writes on-line porn, I will be concentrating on staying alive until 4 pm.
