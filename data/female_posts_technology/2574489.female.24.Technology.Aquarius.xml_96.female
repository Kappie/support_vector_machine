This is when the minor glitches began.  The attendant said all she needed from our printed out tix was the bottom part with the barcode.  So we helped her tear off the bottom.  Jen held onto hers, and Rhy, deciding we did not need the rest of the paper, crumpled and threw mine and his out.  We didn't think anymore about it.  That is until, we got to the entrance of our section and found another usher there. We looked at each other.  We went up to her and asked her if Jen's paper ticket was enough to get us in.    "No, you each need a ticket stub to get in."  Yikes! We doubled back, hurried to the West Entrance and dug through the trash bin and found it.  Whew! That was close.  The concert started and I took liberal pics of Tamia and then Missy who put on such a good show.  No, they didn't allow cameras but I snuck mine in.  During the intermission, this big black girl started doing the equivalent of the otso-otso and all sorts of other dirty dance.  People started throwing money at her and a bunch guys started dancing dirty with her.  This only happens in America, I swear.  So I took a picture.  And that was when my camera got confiscated.  Shyet and double shyet.  So I have no pics of Beyonce who was beautiful and who was carried into the stage on a platform covered with white cloth like royalty.  Her voice was phenomenal and her showmanship just very good.  My favorite was her first performance when she sang Baby Boy and shook her booty.  Well she shook her booty the entire time but Baby Boy is my favorite song.  Anyway, maybe it was just very good to me because I have nothing to compare it to.     I got my camera back.  They did not delete the pics, thank goodness.  Will post pics soon.
