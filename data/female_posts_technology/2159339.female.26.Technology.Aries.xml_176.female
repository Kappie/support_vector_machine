Well, mainly cleaning up and putting things up and making it look like it's been that way all along. At work people are stopping by to tell me that they will 'round up the gang and come by'. What does  gang  mean? M says it will be a rager, but I refuse to call it that. REFUSE! It will be a nice, intimate gathering of all of our closest friends, neighbors, families, co-workers and random people off the street. Tonight is the purse party and house clean-up/craft corner. Batty and I came up with the same idea (separately!) to make little magnets out of candy pictures, so it might actually happen.  Oh man. Friday afternoon and there's no way I can get any work done. Instead, I'm listening to the Magnetic Fields and talking to my Fijian neighbor about fabric and making CD mixes in my head. Tomorrow is the sewing class and party shopping and party.
