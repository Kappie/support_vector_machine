And not just for me; when I attended The Humanities Center in St. Petersburg, FL, the July, Sept, and Nov 2003 classes all had nearly 30 students, forcing the school to divide each class into two groups. Many in my class came from an IT background, which I think was a huge reason why more than half of our class graduated with excellence or honors. The class after me, Jan 2004,  seems to have shrunk back down to a normal size; I suppose the worst of the offshoring is over because I'm noticing companies finally realize offshoring isn't quite the silver bullet they thought it would be. Also, there is still a shortage of talented IT professionals who truly understand what they are doing, especially in the OO and AOP worlds.  I'm sure a lot of people wondered why offshoring happened: corporate greed, the fact that automation leads to replacing humans with technology, etc. Here are a couple other thoughts:  1. I worked abroad at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo back in 1996 and have kept touch with a few friends; one friend was surprised at what a far-reaching impact offshoring had on the US IT business. I asked why, and she said there had been no impact in Japan, simply because few Indians speak Japanese. Projects that are offshored require translators and that doesn't seem to work at all.  I'd always looked upon the English language as an awesome example of global glue. Our wedding in 1999 was a mini global gathering; I'm Asian, my husband's Dutch. The guests were roughly 1/3 Asian, 1/3 European, 1/3 American with a smattering of Middle Eastern, African, Canadian, and Carribean people. And yet, in spite of that variety, everyone was able to communicate with one another - in English. I'd always thought the US had an edge over continents that consisted of a multitude of countries with different languages and different cultures. Not only do you have to get your work done, you have to expend energy translating everything into different languages. What bursts of creativity are hindered because of the delay or barriers to cross-pollination in communication? But when it comes to offshoring, this has definitely bitten us in the butt. India was once an English colony, so most Indians speak English as a second language. We are literally at the mercy of anyone who is English-speaking anywhere in the world willing to work for less.  2. The healthcare crisis gives a whole new shade to offshoring. I'd always thought large corporations were greedy (and granted, they probably still are), but the cold hard fact is places like India have a national healthcare system in place. So not only are the salaries there lower, but corporations don't have to foot the bill for healthcare. When you listen to the Democratic convention and learn that Starbucks pays more for healthcare than for coffee, or Ford pays more for healthcare than for steel, then my friends, the system has failed. It's time to get off the grid (and looping back, that's another reason for the career change; I'm hoping to enable others to get off the grid). Were I a large corporation, I would be forced to make the same hard decision, for offshoring is the only maneuver that makes economic sense, given our healthcare crisis.
