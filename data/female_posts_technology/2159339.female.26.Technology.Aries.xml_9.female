Sometimes in life we must puff up our own chests and bray like mad donkeys and document our own histories. This is one woman's story. (Mine.)  Yesterday when Abby and I were driving back from chowing down on Ethiopian food, I smelled something weird in the car, like burning rubber, so I said, "Do you smell that? It smells like burnt rubber or like someone's brakes are on." I looked over and on her dashboard I saw the "BRAKE" light illuminated so I said, "Oh,  your  brakes are on" and cool as a cucumber I released her emergency brake which was still erect like a penis between us.   Ladies and gentlemen, that is my humble tale... I congratulate myself on my keen olfactory sense unrivaled by any other superhero, except, perhaps, Superdog.
