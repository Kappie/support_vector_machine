I’ve found the perfect cheerleading outfits for my disturbed fantasy slash nerd festival costume.  urlLink http://www.cheeretc.com/stockcheeruniforms.htm  They’re cheap (trust me, they are. You should see what the other places wanted. And none are to be had locally. I’ve spent weeks stalking school coaches, dance clothing stores and former cheerleaders current dance clothing store clerks), they look good (albeit only maroon and not maroon and gold but more on that later), they come in all sizes, and they even have the mini skirted version I, sadly, require. But, and here’s where my plea comes in,  you have to order six sets to order at all!  There is no way I personally need six sets of cheerleading uniforms. Not to mention the cost involved.  (I mean, I guess I could be a cheerleader for the next six halloweens. Sunnydale high, Heathers high, 90210 high, etc. blah blah blah. But what if I lost weight in the next six years. Or, god forbid,  gained  weight? And I’d be really, really old by the time the last one got worn as if I’m not too old already for all this shit. And the cost! Pah! Never mind, no, I cannot purchase six sets.) I need five of you to help me out. I’m pretty sure two of you are already willing. That leaves three. Help me out,  Puleeeezzzzeeee.  I’d like to think you’re going, “Oh ha ha! That wacky Valerie, she’s disturbed in an obsessed yet amusing and mostly harmless way and so what the hell. I’ll play her little reindeer games. And I can probably use the uniform later for (insert your own fantasy here).”  Instead of going, “Oh ha ha! That wacky Valerie, she doesn’t have the sense god gave a goose. Why isn’t she in therapy or heavily medicated or something. I think I’m just going to sit back and watch her little drama crash and burn and then she’ll have to make her own outfit and she can’t even sew so that’ll be even better. Honey, do we have plenty of film in the camera?” There must be five of you out there that like me enough, right? I’ve been told on rare occasions that people like me. I know for a fact that geriatrics like me. Small children and pets do not like me, they simply fear me. Luckily none of you are small children or pets. And if you’re a guy and you’re reading this, don’t let the fact that you are male deter you. I suspect you have lovely legs, all long and perfect for a pleated skirt. I couldn’t figure out the cost of the chest patches cause, you know,  math . But I know I can make maroon and gold chest patches out of felt. I may suck with the needle but I’m golden with the scissors and glue. Then that would be the gold on the, mostly, maroon uniforms. Really, ask anyone that attended the 2nd Harry Potter movie with me. I made the most amazing maroon and gold scarf out of felt. It looked just like the ones the kids in the movie were wearing.     Ok, so I’ve calmed down some. Just think it over. It’ll be loads of fun,  really . You know you want to help.
