She ran her fingers through her long brown hair as she waited for his answer.  Her avatar looked like her real-life self but a little skinnier in certain places.    The virtual reality, VR for short, club they meet in was packed with other avators.  Everyone out looking for a wonderful time away from being their selves.  Music playing loud to create a personal atmosphere.  Avators dancing on the dance floor while others congregated around the bar on the side.  A few sat at the tables in the back where they were sitting alone in a corner to keep everything private.   He smiled.  "Of course I dare.  I am going to place the note so far deep in your system that it will take you a week to find it."  His avatar was tall, dark and handsome unlike his real-life self in which he was a little overweight from sitting and usually dishevelish from not paying attention to his image.  He lived on the west coast in California working for a mojo corporation called Green Genesis.  Even he didn't know anything about the corporation only that it paid him to keep the systems up and running.   "Then let the games begin, my over-confident friend.  Let's see who can place the note first and then lets see who can find the note placed on our systems."  She lived and worked on the east coast.  Pennsylvania to be more precise.  She worked for a corporation called Omikron Logistics.  All she knew that it was some sort of research company that worked with the government sometimes.    She met him about two years ago at a VR convention.  They both had to attend and their tables were placed together so they talked during the slow periods.  They met again in the VR club and started the game to keep things interesting.  Since they both work as system administrators, they keep each other on edge with the game they play.  They hack in each other's system and place a hidden note.  They race to see who is the quickest in hacking and finding the note.  It helps them find holes within their security plus gives them something to do while they work the night shift.     All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003
