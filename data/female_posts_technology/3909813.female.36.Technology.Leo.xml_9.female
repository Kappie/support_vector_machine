This is so insane.  To make matter worse, my son has been grounded and it is insane that his friends parents are questioning our parenting skills, and basically we are punishing every one of my son's friends because my son is grounded.  OH MY GAAAAA.  Is it unfair to say that I really don't care what his friends or their parents feel?  Footnote, my son is in a band, and let me say, behaved in a very inappropriate manner, hence the grounding.  The band is suffering.  Should I care?
