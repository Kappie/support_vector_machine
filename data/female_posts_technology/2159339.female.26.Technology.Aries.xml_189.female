Well, she will fall in love, get dumped, hide in room to watch the dumper drive away, feel really low, then have her teeth cleaned and go on a job interview that goes really well. That's what's in store for her. For more predictions on the 26th year, tune in next month.  Speaking of birthdays, over the weekend I wrapped a box for someone's birthday. The box is well-wrapped and there is one pink ribbon adorning it. That is all that we will speak of for now, as the walls have ears and the Windows (Microsoft) have eyes.
