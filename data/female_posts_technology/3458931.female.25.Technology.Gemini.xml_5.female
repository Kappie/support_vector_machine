I saw an interesting article and wanted to email him about it because no one else I know would "get it". I keep hoping for the phone to ring or for there to be a knock on the door. I want to tell him how wrong this is, how we're so meant for each other. I feel so pathetic, like those wussy lovesick girls who write really crappy poetry.   I think the website is helping, it's hard to tell. I can be fine for a while and then an instant later be in pain again.  I have so much to do right now, I need to find the drive to get it all done. I'm taking a night class at a local university and have a mid-term exam tonight, and a project due on the weekend. I'm moving in less than a week and have to get my things packed. On top of that I have a full time job and a daughter to raise. Normally I can handle it but this whole situation is starting to make it overwhelming.   My friend is watching my daughter tonight while I'm at class. She lives right across the street from M. I wonder if he'll see my car while I'm there, I wonder if he'll see me. I wonder if I'll catch a glimpse of him, I wonder if I could keep my composure if I did. I wish I could make this insane little trains of thought go away.
