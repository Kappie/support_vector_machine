I know, it sounds kinda corny...but watching the mothers and doctors really drove home both the resilience and the fragility of life.  Some babies were normal and healthy, but others had problems that made birth very difficult.  One little girl with Spina Bifida had a sack of spinal fluid on her back that forced the doctors to perform a C-section.  They didn't want to break the sack and harm the baby.  Another little girl had a portion of her small intestine that developed outside her belly button.  Both babies underwent surgery and both came out happy and healthy.  Amazing.  Without modern medicine those babies would have died.  Life is too miraculous to be taken for granted.
