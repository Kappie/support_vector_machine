I was packing my lunch this morning and checked the calorie count of my TV dinner.  790 calories...I was taken aback.  A closer look at the package revealed it was a Hungry Man tv dinner with  "1 lb. of food!" .  Sheesh, what did I get myself into.  And I didn't have enough time to prepare anything else.  For lunch, I heated up my 1-lb. tv dinner, carefully scooped out the mashed potatos, the apple cranberry dessert and felt better.  It has 3 pcs. of chicken.  I have one left and I ain't touching that thing.  But I will grab a couple of these fries my friends' offering me....
