I wonder if the things I knit become imbued with the programs I watch while knitting them. For instance this last scarf would have quite a bit of  'Law  Order' in it, so hopefully the wearer will not feel the need to go out and commit a crime, but perhaps feel more of a need to fight for justice. I hope so.  I'm hoping that the ones knitted during Sex and the City result in people getting laid (or at the very least being able to afford a pair of Manolos).  Oh, the Google stalking thing? I came across this term while reading another blog a while ago, and thought 'heh, what sort an idiot would do such a thing'.    Clearly, me.  Here's the  urlLink beginner's guide  to Google Stalking   I love that there's a guide.  Who was I stalking may you ask? Sure, go ahead.  It was a bit of response to a group email sent out, one name looked unfamiliar, could this be the long lost school friend Mr Some Sort of Potential Paramour had been talking about?? Yes! It was!   No more than two links later, there she was. Excellent! I was actually more proud of my internet search abilities than anything else.  Of course, the social ramifications of what I had done failed to register just then. They did later.  Yes, I am psycho freak stalking poor defenceless people on the internet due to insecurities and clearly not having anything better do to.  How did I become this person? Why did I become this person?  I blame the media.  And Google's comprehensive search capabilities and ease of use.
