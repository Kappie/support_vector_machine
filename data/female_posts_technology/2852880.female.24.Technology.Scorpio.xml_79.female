I didn't know what to expect and when I walked in there was a big group of people doing this complicated but really cool dance. I was like, woah, I've got some catching up to do! Then I saw all these other people waiting on the side and realized that our class hadn't started. Turns out that was Hip Hop 4 and we're in Hip Hop 1. It actually wasn't very hard to pick up at all. I would even think about trying Hip Hop 2 except for one thing. In the warm up, you have to dance across the room "freestyle." I suppose I'm freestyle-challenged (read: I look like a freakin' idiot). Luckily, most people had similar issues, so I think I sort of blended in, but that was the hardest part. The fact that you have to be travelling across the floor while hip-hop dancing was just not natural for me. Once we got to the actual dance, it was much easier. Matt and Karen did a good job and we all had the dance figured out. I'm definitely glad I went!
