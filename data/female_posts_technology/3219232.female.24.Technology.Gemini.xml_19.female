I asked for it and well-I got it. My personal life has been quiet lately. Guess I got tired of the drama so I don’t get myself into crazy situations anymore. Or perhaps, I’m just getting older. I know what’s possible and what’s not. I now know what I want and what I can’t have. I’m more realistic and somewhat jaded. There still is a glimmer of hope that resides inside but it’ll take a lot before it surfaces again.
