The pages come up almost instantly, the interface is a whole lot friendlier than Yahoo, and it has up to 1,000 MB of storage.  That's right, 1,000!  I believe that Yahoo and MSN currently offer about 4.    I'll start using this more often so that I can do my job as a beta tester and test it out.  Feel free to  urlLink send me Gmail .
