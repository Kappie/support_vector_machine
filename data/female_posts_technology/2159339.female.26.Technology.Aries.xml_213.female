I will tell you the sordid details later, but it's my right to do some bashing to regain some self-esteem. (I rise by stepping on others, right?) Here are the things I won't miss:  * Fatty fatness * Incessant Snoring * Overall Hairiness * Quadruple Wattle * Small Penis  I am actually in great pain and my nose is permanently tingling from all the crying, but I'll be fine. I've got great roommates, good friends, money in the bank, er,  credit on my cards , and I live in a 1st-world country. Plus, my mom is still alive and I have a magnificent family. And shoes. Boys may come and go, but great shoes are forever...  Plus, I'm going to Coachella with Abby.  To get me through this heartbreak, I have pinned Bart Davenport to my sweater. He will ward off anymore deranged rockabillies from sniffin round my cooch.
