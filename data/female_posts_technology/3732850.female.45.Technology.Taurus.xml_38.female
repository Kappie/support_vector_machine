Sometimes a rock chip when meeting a car or behind a truck flying at the window leaves an impression. I wonder what glass in made out of? I would think they would make a windshield strong enough to withhold a rock chipping the window but I suppose going down the road and this rock is flying up at sixty miles an hour, it's just lucky the whole window didn't shatter. I still can't figure out this one break in my window. It is on the passenger side and is spreading out like a spider. The only thing I can think of is a baseball hitting it. There was an auction and I noticed it after the sale. Now the one crack in the windshield is cutting across getting close to the driver side. I have had people tell me that it looks like a break from the inside or the sun can do that to a window. I had to laugh. How cn the sun have done it when I had my car parked in the shade? The day was very hot. I guess to find out, I will never really know what happened, just that I need to get it fixed. It is still on the passenger side slowing innching its way to the driver side right where it is eyesight level. The crack coming across is by the mirror now and I'm hoping it will bend downward instead of hit at eye level. I don't want to get stopped for this cracked window. Someone told me once that the state trooper will do that. I would think it would need to be pretty bad for that to happen and with most of this in the upper right hand corner of the passenger side, I would think this isn't as serious as other car windows that I have witnessed in parking lots or the grocery story lot. Some cars don't even have a window. Other cars put up cardboard. Some cars use cheap plastic and some cars don't cover the window at all. I'm happy with the car I have now. I find myself grateful for the one I have when I see others driving cars worse than my own.
