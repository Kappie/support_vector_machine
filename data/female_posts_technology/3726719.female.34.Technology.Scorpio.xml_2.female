It's strange because of what experience has brought it about.  See I have this roommate.  He's a cool dude that moved in about a month ago.  We each have our own lives, so we don't see each other constantly.  We even occassionally hang out.  I consider us pals.  He can install cat doors and I can teach him about  urlLink Financial Peace  budgeting.  It's a win-win situation.  The strange thing is the overwhelming sense of loneliness I have felt since he moved in.  I never would have imagined that the presence of another human being would cause such a thing.  For the most part, it's not a noticeable presence, this "loneliness."  Other times, it's all encompassing and the world I see around me is through the haze it's created.    Now the frustrating part of this phenomenon, is that I am not typically a sad, depressed, or negative person.  My tendency is to be cheerful, lively, and enthusiastic...yes even when I'm alone.  It's the cheerleader in me I guess (and yes this is a personality aspect that really gets on some peoples nerves).   So for a woman like myself, who is basically cute, somewhat intelligent, career satisfied, a new homeowner, and financially responsible (most of the time), it's sobering and confusing to be consumed by a feeling like loneliness.  I'm surrounded by people all day long.  I have many friends that I love.  And I'm wondering if a part of me is still preoccupied with that bill of goods my generation of little girls got sold by Disney.  You know the one....sweet girl, handsome prince, love everlasting, happily every after.   I wonder if humans really have the capacity to truly love someone not their offspring.  I mean thinking of the marriages I know of, there's exactly 1 that I would call successfull and happy for both people.    And there's the spiritual awareness in me that's going "hey wait a minute...we're not suppose to need someone else to be happy."   To that I say "well, I am happy.  I am a complete human being.  What's so wrong with wanting to share that with someone else?  And is it so wrong to hope that in that supportive, loving, best friend, partner relationship there is great sex?"  Of course I'm unable to answer myself.    This leads to wondering if I'm just expecting too much.  I've been told by friends that I'm high-maintenance or picky.  Is it really too much to ask for an intelligent man, that I have some attraction for, and vice versa?  Is responsibility that hard to come by?   Is it over-zealous to want good conversation and mindless couch cuddling with the same person?  And is there a decent man out that, that isn't attached, that could get past the not-so-perfect exterior to the adorable light that's inside?  I have yet to meet a person or read a book that can provide insight into these questions.  If I believed the magazines and television shows, I'd believe that no man could ever want to be with me until I was a size 2 (which I've never been), had perfect teeth, perfect skin, bigger breasts, a cuter nose, wore skimpy clothes, begged for sex multiple times a day, and didn't ever want to talk about how I felt about anything.  I'm not falling for that one.  I can't believe that we are all so shallow.  Or are we?  So I work, live in my house, and occassionally post an online personal ad to find someone brave enough to meet me for coffee or a drink.  I've met several nice guys.   Some I still talk with every so often.  For the most part, there's no chemistry, no interest, no understanding, and a regret for the time wasted not doing something more entertaining.  I'm not simple or uncomplicated - I'm mulit-faceted.  It's not the easiest thing to be around I suppose.  I'm looking to meet someone that's got depth and isn't just surface - and who can enjoy being around me.   From the present moment, seems like I need to chaulk it up to "not in this lifetime" and be content to become an old woman with 20 cats.  I'm not content with that thought.  So I'll keep living...and occassionally searching....usually always laughing.   It's still confusing though!  :o)
