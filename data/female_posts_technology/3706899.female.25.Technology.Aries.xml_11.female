Next up is my first foray into circular knitting...a simple roll-brim hat in Lion Brand Wool-Ease Thick and Quick Denim Twist.  It's a strand of slate blue and a strand of navy twisted together.  I'm going to be knitting a lot of blue accessories between now and the beginning of next hockey season.  That way I'll be the girl in the spirit section wearing a different handknit hat or scarf each home game.  Yes, I'm a nerd.    I'm also participating in a Booga bag knitalong starting...soon?  I'm using this yarn for the bag:   It's Noro Kureyon #124.  Yummy.  Also, stay tuned for Kool-Aid dying, socks, catnip mice, and a whole bunch of other stuff in the near future!
