I was famished so we stopped by to have breakfast. When we reached the custom, it was almost 8 and there was already a traffic jam. I guess everyone was taking advantage of the long weekend to go somewhere. Precisely why we got up so early - to avoid the jam!! But we end up being stuck in it for 3 hours or so. Originally a 3 hrs road trip to KL (at a conservative 120km/hr speed) became 8 hrs, thanks to the jam when entering M'sia and Kuala Lumpur. Well, even the locals drive to KL from other states.  While we were speeding, our driver was in a daze when he over took a traffic police and sped up. Of cos we were asked to pull over and the local police threatened to issue a summon. We knew he wanted $ and the market rate is RM50. So driver bargained with him, "Sir, help me reduce lah." "How much you want me to reduce?" "50?" "(roll eyeballs) aiya, 50?! no lah!" "ah? then? 100?" "ok lah. ok lah." After that, driver was very awake and learnt from his poor negotiating skills.  This trip was quite impromtu. It was impossible to find any hotels. Even the most lousy ones were full! (Including those that are haunted. : ) Lucky for my sis' great network, we bunked in with her friend's friend's condo for a night. We were lucky to find a place to stay, for free too. We counted our blessing when there were three mattresses and water (not hot) to wash up. Good thing we had taken precautions. We brought our own pillows, cushions and warm clothings for the cold night. It was dusty and quite dirty but it sure beats sleeping in the car.  When we were packing and going through our stuff the next morning, we realised that 2nd sis' passport wasn't stamped by the Malaysia custom on entry. This will cause a lot of troubles as we read from previous reports on the news. It usually requires some under table $ too. This was the first time the "passport-in-charge" forgot to check for entry stamps when we pass the custom and it had to happen to be the first time one passport didn't get stamped. We called the tourism board and were told that it "shouldn't be a problem". We wonder since we had the impression that the Malaysia bureaucrats are difficult. When we reach the departing custom, sis was directed to another office. As the computer had her entry record, and she still had her custom "white-card" that had a entry stamp, the officer just made a note and stamped her passport for exit. *phew* It wasn't as bad as we thought.  Interesting experiences. Lotsa lesson learnt.  This will be the last time we make last minute travel arrangements.
