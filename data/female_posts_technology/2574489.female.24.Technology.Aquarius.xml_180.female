This ensures that anything you need will be cross-referenced and minimizes the chance of you forgetting things.  2. Do NOT, like me, ignore your husband's encouragements to write up that list and as a result forget things. Like your digital camera to capture all the nice moments with your family, a toothbrush, other necessary toiletries, and most important of all, underwear.  3. Do wake up with plenty of time for you to get ready and make sure you have everything ready with you.  4. Do NOT, like me, keep hitting the snooze button so that by  time you finally wake up, your family is knocking on the door ready to go to the airport.  5. When your husband says, "babe, you better drive on the way to the airport cause I don't want to argue about my driving", take the wheels and drive. Or shut your mouth.  6. Do NOT, like me, ask him to drive anyway and then proceed to be a back-seat, or in my case, a passenger driver. At least we didn't part angry and upset.   7. If at all possible, pinpoint the exact gate you're heading to. It will avoid arguments on the way to the airport.  These are just some of the things that went wrong in my departure. I'm back to reality now, but will write more details about my trip later. And oh yea, I missed blogging and reading up on my blog lists!
