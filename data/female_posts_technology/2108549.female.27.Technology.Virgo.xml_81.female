It was a very eclectic group, all of having little to nothing in common other than sobriety.  Or in my case,  the desire to get some sobriety.  I didn't know then but 3 of the people in that group would later save my life.  I ended up staying with 2 of them, living with a third for a bit until I took care of her house when she moved.  At one point I could picture each and every one of these people as if they were people I had met in person. We were and I suppose still are, the Richard Cranium family.  We even made a family tree. I was, of course, the baby of the family and at 21 was by far the youngest.  Well 2 of them are getting married. Its a marriage we all have been waiting for and I am so happy for them.  And they have asked me to be the flower girl.  *dances in a circle*    It will be interesting but I can guarantee one thing for sure...  I ain't wearin' pink.
