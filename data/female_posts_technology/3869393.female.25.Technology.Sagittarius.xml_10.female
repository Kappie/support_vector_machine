The muggy weather coupled with a feeling of emptiness overtook me last night.  All I did was watch the ceiling for about 2 hours and then I guess the feeling of emptiness overtook me and I feel asleep.  Hardly 3 hours later I woke up again to the splatter of the rain on the window pane.  What a beautiful sight, complete black and empty all around and only the moon kissing against the stars and the smell of wet sand overtaking my senses.  Watching this sight for a few minutes and I could only remember the time when I had gone for a drive down the ECR, it was raining heavily, so the car had to pull over for a while and wait.  It was so pleasant to see the rain splatter onto the wind shield and run down the same. The clean green leaves and the swaying trees in the rain...gosh, still remember that sight as it was yesterday.    Once again, sleep over powered me and I slept for 1 hour this time, only to be woken up by the noises of the bed creaking.  Woke up at 4am this morning....loitered around the house and finally gave up trying to sleep for that night.  Got ready for the gym at 5am and then went and spend some time with my grandparents.  Different feeling to spend time with them in the morning...fresh and easy. Began my walk to the gym this morning, was quite a pleasant feeling,clear and crisp air blew past me and the heaviness began to lift up and out of my system.  Once I got to the gym, things became a lot better, worked out real hard....gosh, the pains of overweight!  Was feeling a  little low before getting to office this morning, dad wasnt around in town today to talk to,and mom aint really ready to listen to my blabber.  So just had to lock my thoughts away, keep a smile and head to office.  Office has been quite depressing so far....quality issues are bobbing me down big time and the feeling of emptiness is now starting to grow back into my system.  Pre Jan 03,my life was perfect, not a level of commitment, unhappiness, anger, etc to deal with and now its a pack of emotions rolled into a jigsaw puzzle which seems to have enough of pieces missing!  When will I find the missing pieces????  I wish I had some idea about this...:(
