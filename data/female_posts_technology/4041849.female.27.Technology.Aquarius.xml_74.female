SHUT THE FUCK UP, PEOPLE... IT'S REALLY NOT THAT FUNNY.      damn. they're still fucking laughing. and it was... 3 minutes ago.       if it's the funniest damn thing you've ever heard, stop, go home, rent yourself some richard pryor. or if you're easily offended, try robin williams or wayne brady. they're not as funny, but they're sure as hell funnier than a stupid ringtone.
