And when you finally get the fuck there, your ass know you wish you were still happily living off Mommy's allowance.  If it isn't one thing, it's another. I've just come from a dentist appointment to find that I have to pay $700 out of pocket for a procedure. I'm behind on some payments I need to make--renewal of my Cotsco membership; renewal of my AAA membership; paying my goddamn $40 library fine so I can get my read on. I have to literally count every penny and I'm so sick of this shit. But of course I didn't mention that I went out to eat three times this weekend...why? Because that makes me fucking happy. But I don't want to be grown folk and pay a $700 dental bill. Fugged up isn't it?  The biggest thing on my mind is my considering dropping out of the housing market. I just feel like I need to wait. I can't afford a $1300 or $1400 a month housing expense. I don't want to pay that. I can't pay that and travel. I can't pay that and do dinner club. I can't pay that and go see Amel Laurrieux at the Carter Barron or Earth, Wind and Fire at Nissan Pavilion. Blasphemy! So I may wait until I don't have to pay $10K above someone's asking price just for the privilege of living in their shithole that they barely bother to clean. The housing market is some bullshit right now and I'm tired of it. So I'm a homebuyer drop-out.  I've been mean to men lately. A dude came up to me that I do remember seeing somewhere and asked me if he knew me from somewhere. He parked his car to come inside and talk to me and I dissed him hard. He just looked young and full of games and I wasn't interested. I need a MAN to come with the real. Someone on my level. I just feel like I'm going to be mistreated or he's going to be on the DL or something. I'm just in a bad place with men right now. I'm not really interested. Or the ones that interest me don't even look my way. So I think I should just take a sabbatical. I only mildly miss the ding-a-ling. And with these men out here, you gotta worry about dying over that or getting some shit up in your snatch that you can't get rid of. I'm just not feeling it right now.  I had a strange dream the other day during my long catnap that Tyrone of all people called. Then later that night, I was at CVS and I was doing my credit card. I happened to look up for no reason at the cashier's name tag. It read "Dereck." Sigh. WTF? Coincidink?  I am looking forward to a fab-u-lous summer though. It would be nice to have a freak-a-leak so I can be "working that back...don't know how to act..." going slow motion on that niggra. I gotta lot of pent up energy to unleash on the next victim. It's just at a low roar right now. I need someone to reawaken it in me.   Other than that, summer summer summertime is looking alllllright. I got some fun things planned and hope to do some more. I also decided that if I don't get the house this year I'm going to Vegas for New Years Eve and maybe hang out in LA. Shit, I'm not wasting a year of not traveling for a house I never got.  This was a fugged up entry. I'm in a strange place...
