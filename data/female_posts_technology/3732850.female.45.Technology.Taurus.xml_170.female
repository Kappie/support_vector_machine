Reading his words you see the contrast between Chief Seattle's people, "My people are few" and the Big Chief at Washington's people, "His people are many".  These are statements, facts without emotion, passive.  He uses powerful imagery throughout like, "day and night cannot dwell together".  Even though the title is "We May Be Brothers", by his question "how then can we be brothers?" and all the other differences, I wonder if he was saying here that it would be impossible.
