An email was distributed this week from the Public Affairs officer at our workplace.  The subject line was "Free Ice Cream" and it called for all employees and contractors to come to a certain conference room and recieve free ice cream in exchange for a phone call or letter to their Congressional representative about an issue they are trying to push into legislation.  I can think of several things that are wrong with this.    First, I feel patronized with the ice cream offer.  Do they really think they have to bribe people in that way, or that it will work on anyone?  Second, the workplace is not the right environment for politics.  If they regularly read my blog they'd know this.       When it comes from an official company representative, it's coercion.  If someone at our office were so inclined and sufficiently offended, a decent lawsuit could be made of this.  I'm not going to bother.  Third, I understand exactly why this proposed legislation is in the company's best interest, but it's entirely possible that it's not in every contractor and employee's best interest.  There are people who work for the company who make a great deal more than I can imagine to live and work in Washington and lobby Congress all day long.  I'm not one of them.  This whole thing was in bad taste.      I was entertained that they didn't seem to get the response they had hoped for.  After the "campaign" was over, the PA lady came around with a cooler giving out free ice cream.  I declined, saying that I was on a diet, but twenty minutes later a fudge bar landed on my desk anyway.  I forgot about the diet and grudgingly ate their fudge bar.  It was good.
