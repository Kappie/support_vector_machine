I thought that this would be a good forum to tell the good and the bad of dating.    The following questions are examples of what I feel might be helpful to other daters.  Where's a good place for a first date?  What are your dating nightmare stories?  Do you have good ideas for meeting new and fun people?  Do you use an online service?  What are the best ones?  Do you have any tips as to the best way to fill out the online profiles?  How do you transition from the cyberworld, to the real world?  There are probably others I haven't thought of.  I'd like to add links, but I am waiting to get feedback from others before adding them.  Thanks for taking the time to read my blog, I look forward to hearing your thoughts!  Angie
