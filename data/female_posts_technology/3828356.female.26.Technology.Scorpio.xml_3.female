Not to mention the fact that my husband and I have spent the past 4 days cooped up in our new home, doing a bit of a facelift...yes, I particularly enjoyed it when I was sanding plaster down, and it was sticking to my sweat. Perhaps it's a new beauty treatment??  And speaking of sweat...I never knew the places my body could sweat from. Have any of you ever experienced sweat forming on the fronts of your legs? Well, it happens. Thank goodness for my ever trusty "d0-rag", because it absorbed all of my forehead and head sweat and kept if from running into my eyes.  However, on the bright side, we got pretty much all of the work done that we wanted to. The living room and dining room are freshly painted, the bedroom is freshly painted, the living room carpet and bedroom carpet have been ripped up and removed, and the hardwoods have been re-done (the simple way - with a kit, no sanding...that will happen later). And, I think it all looks pretty darn cool.  However, I think that air conditioning is definitely on the wish list.   In the mean time, I'm completely exhausted and ready for bed. Rejoice, for tomorrow is a brand new day, back at the grindstone we all love to call "work".  -J.
