That's six entire non-working days. Our plans for Argentina got scrapped because of my aunt's cancer, so I asked my mom if she would give me cooking lessons. She agreed. I asked her if she would help me differentiate between meat cuts and show me how to select a ripe mango. I do not know these things. One time I bought her some coconuts and she smirked because they were "bad" coconuts. How was I supposed to know that I was supposed to shake them? And pretend I DID shake them, what was I supposed to listen for anyway? This summer, this knowledge will be mine.
