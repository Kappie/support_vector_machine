Gosh, i don't want the subjects test. i want fucking general test only!!!!!!!!! shit! i may have to just take freaking computer science subjects test. other disappointment: there is no October test, just November and so on. barely get my scores in at end of December.  Did i do something i wasn't supposed to? ok besides the little stuff, i meant something really Mean to someone? Why is this happening to me? ------------------------------------------ since i'm all angered, i mind as well degrade myself and show my weakness. I am so freaking upset and i guess jealous. i have not been so fucking jealous since the younger years. i'm going back to the ex-friend who out of nowhere is getting paid more than me now and she only has a high school diploma (barely).  my boss offers me a job as management BUT i need a degree (which i do) AND the fucked up part is that the low end starts at $23.41/hr. the high end starts at $29.88/hr. And when i say offered, i mean nothing fucking official. haven't seen it yet and its been months.  now, my ex-friend(no life, no ambition, no education, no experience (under my terms), no professionalism ) gets a job that requires ONLY 5 years of experience in a general area AND HS diploma. I could've easily applied for it but being i am still fucking waiting..... anyhoo, she gets paid $22/hr. ALSO, she was picked over someone with more experience and education, now theres MIS-Management for you. They picked her because she kisses ass and they know her more than the other person.  this makes a fucking joke of me! working my ass off to get this job that someone with the heart and brain of an ant can also get. When does paid for performance come in? for work? for life? God, how does that work in with life? Satisfaction/goodness for efforts/hardwork you put in.  HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN? WE WORK FOR THE SAME COMPANY. HOW DOES ONE JOB EXPECT MORE AND PAY JUST AS LESS AS ANOTHER WHICH EXPECTS LESS?????? HOW!!!!!?????  thats where my jealousy stems from. besides that, my ex-friend is going to love being closer to me so she can torment me. i hate it. i could easily file a sexual harrassment lawsuit on her. i've got one proof and one theory. damn bitch!  okay, hows that for honesty? am i really jealous? i'm confused. i think i am a little bit, just a little bit jealous but more upset because she gets to torment me and upset at the system.  I AM BETTER THAN SHE'LL EVER COME CLOSE TO.  God, give me strength to not allow this person to annoy me in the early dawn of my sleep and make me have to get up and blog.  okay-i'm feeling better now, i'm going to breathe and never mention this again on here. it will all be over as soon as i discuss it with my boss. i really am better. the curse words tend to give off more heat than intended. but is that really true? hmm. okay, no more about this.
