I was surfing few days ago, looking at what kind of courses, qualification I can do. By the end of that day, I selected BSc of Psychology and Dip. of Physiotherapy. After hearing my sis' opinion, I feel Physiotherapy will help me find my passion. As some might know, I'm really keen on Bio Science. *wink*  I contacted the incharge at NYP on the Dip of Physiotherapy. The min requirement is "A" and even thou I've a BSc, I am lack of Bio background. He informed me of an accelerated program at the Nursing dept which is suitable for "pple like me". It is very subsidised and I can receive allowance throughout the 2 yrs course. At the end of the course, I'll be 'employed' by a local hospital. (Bonded I believe).   Nursing was what I've been thinking but family members are against it. And i don't think I am up for the 12-hours shift either. Haha. However it has a lot of avenues that you can specialise in.   Physiotherapy really sound good to me. Even if I want to try NYP (for 3 yrs), I'll have wait until I finish my 2 yrs bond with EDB (i'll be 27-8). By the time I can practise physiotherapy, I'll be 30 - 31. If I choose this path, I'll want to go towards research and eventually PhD. OMG, then I can stop speculating if I'll ever get married. Hahhaa. This path will be putting my 7-8 yrs of Comp Sci to waste. All that money, time and sleepless nights put to waste.   Alternatively, I can go oversea again and pursue a Deg in Physiotherapy. And move on to Masters and PhD. But where to find sponsors? Where is my golden tortise??   So for the time being, I'm stucked with my contract. Maybe I'll take up a part time job to save up for further studies. Maybe I'll look at what part time Masters I can take, but that might be a waste of money if it's not put into use. Maybe I'll think about what business I can do and look for investors. *wink wink*  The paper chase is so tiring.
