My jaw just dropped.  She played piano at an old Church that I had attended while living in The Woodlands.  I got to know her through my late husband who sung in the Choir that she accompanied nearly every Sunday and special events.  I continued to have opportunities to get to know her a little better as I met her in other activities at the Church as well.  I had told her (for example) that I, too, had loved to play the piano but I didn't have the opportunity to play it since the time that I left home for college (many, many, many moons ago).  She offered to teach me to bring back my "swing" in the piano, if I would find a piano of some type to practice upon.  Our paths would cross often here and there, and she would ask if I found my piano yet?  Sometimes, she would add that maybe I could just practice on the piano at the Church sometime.  Other emotions resurfaced as I began to think about her kind heart and how she accompanied the choir who sang at my late husband's memorial service.  It meant so much for me to have them there at my late huband's memorial service, especially since singing in the Church was a passion for him.  My husband will have been gone to be with the Lord in just a few months from now (on November 11th) for two years.  I didn't think I would be quite so affected still from my husband's own death.  It clearly is something that I will have to continue to deal with for many years to come.   Dear God:  Please sound the trumpets for Laurie who so passionately played in the Church for you and make room for her to play for You in Heaven.  Please wrap your everloving arms around her, remove any degree of pain or suffering that she had endured here on Earth, and make room for her to play for the angels who sing for You.  In Your name, I pray.  Amen.
