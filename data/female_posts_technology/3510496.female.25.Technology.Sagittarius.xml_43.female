First and foremost let me touch on types of pasta. The very common ones that are very well known among us are macaroni (long/short cut tubes) and spaghetti (fine/medium rods). But do you know that they are 300 different types of pasta. New shapes are being designed and named everyday. Hmmmmm ... perhaps I should designed and named my own pasta.  Here are a few of the many pastas:  Penne  (my favorite): feather-liked tubes, small pasta  Fettuccine : medium ribbons (mee-kuning, bit-flat version)  Linguine : long-flat ribbons similar to fettuccine  Tagliarini : thin ribbons (Italian rendition of beehoon)  Tagliatelle : broad ribbons (Italian rendition of kuay teow)  Lasagne : sheets of flat rectangular pasta  Orecchiette : ear-shaped pasta  Lumache : snail-shaped shells  Lumaconi : big shells often stuff with fillings like minced meat  Eliche : spirals  Bucatini : long, medium tubes  Cannelloni : large, thick tubes  Ditalini : short tubes similar to macaroni  Farfalle : bow-shaped  Fusilli : long-twisted  Picking up above pasta from supermarket is no hussle. But take note of this tip. Pasta are not meant to be eaten over-boiled. The best way is, to let the water boil, then plunged in the pasta. Not vice versa. Add some olive oil to give that pasta some 'glossy' look. Do sprinkle in some salt, because pasta are naturally tasteless. The wonderful thing with pasta, you can even bake or fry it.  Picking up ready-made pasta sauce from the shelves is also no hussle. But I can guarantee it's no hussle to DIY too. But remember this rule, thick sauce for thick pasta, thin sauce for thin pasta.    Bolognaise   (basically its tomato and meat sauce - SIL's recipe)  total time: 2 hours 30 minutes | serves 4  2 tbsp of olive oil 1 small onion, finely chopped 1 clove of garlic, finely chopped 250g of minced beef 1 medium tin of tomato puree Fresh tomatoes, cut(optional, for those who prefer more sour-ish) Few tbsp of grinded chilli (put more for more spicy-ness) 2-3 fresh basil leaves Sprinkle of rosemary herb Sprinkle of salt Sprinkle of ground black pepper  On a big saucepan, heat olive oil and saute in the onion, garlic and grinded chilli. Add in the minced meat and cook until it turns color. Dissolve in the tomato puree and stir in for a few minute before putting in the fresh, cut tomatoes. Put in the basil, rosemary, salt and black pepper. The best is to cover and simmer (cook in lower heat) for 2 hours.  Served on drained pasta. Compliment it with grated Parmesan cheese.  Some other pasta recipe, some other time, ok? Mama Mia!!!
