For dinner I had Boston Bluefish (really cheap fish) baked in a sauce I made from canned, diced tomatoes, some green beans, red peppers and onions, and salt and pepper. It was really good, although I made it a little too spicy. With that, I had half a cob of corn, half a potato, and some salad.   Later, for a snack I had some melba toast, lite cottage cheese, and some grapes.       I  drank MORE than 8 glasses of water yesterday, took my multivitamin, and did 20 minutes of random muscle work with one of those big elastic bands. Ask me to demonstrate what I have dubbed the “Really Painful Outer Thigh and Butt Exercise” haha. No seriously, it’s hot.          I     also heard (try this at your own risk, because I haven’t tested) a recipe for fat free, carb free mashed potatoes. Sounds ridiculous, no? Well, apparently, it’s because instead of potatoes you use cooked CAULIFLOWER. My friend said it tastes EXACTLY like mashed potatoes. Apparently you put cooked cauliflower, butter-flavoured cooking spray (which sounds narsty, I’d use margarine,) skim milk and salt and pepper in a blender and go nuts. It sounds gross, but maybe I’ll try it sometime this week.         Also, I found this:   urlLink  http://www.timhortons.com/english/images/CanNutritionGuideE.pdf             It lists the calories in everything at Tim Hortons. A medium one cream one sugar coffee contains 78 calories, so I’m assuming a large double double is at least 4 times that....Yeah, 312, that's about what I thought.         Happy reading, and don’t quit! You’re doing great. Harshala, where is your post girl??
