Besides, just being able to sort through e-mail has helped, and if I cancelled the meetings I've already made people reschedule twice one  more  time, they might decide to have them without me.  And that would mean someone making a decision without my input, and we all know that wouldn't fly (at least with me).  ;)  Busy weekend already - Daisy's 30th birthday has finally arrived, and we're going out celebrating Saturday.  Don't know how long I'll be able to stay out, but I can't miss this one.  Brunch Sunday, followed by an evening at  urlLink The Bluebird Cafe , for Jeanne's debut. No - not my sister, the OTHER Jeanne in my life... ;)  Sometime in there, I have a couple of bottles of asti that will make some pretty darn good mimosas.  I think I just planned Saturday afternoon.  :)
