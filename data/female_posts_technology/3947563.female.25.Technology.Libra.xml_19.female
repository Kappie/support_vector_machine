I had a (chocolate!) shake for breakfast, grapes for a snack, another shake for lunch, as well as some salad with low fat ranch, and some various vegetables for a snack. I had NO COFFEE today, and I didn't even miss it. Then, however, Sharron and I went out right after work to go to the batting cage. By the time we got there, it was probably about 6:30 or so, and I was reeeeealy hungry. I should have known that was a bad idea. Normally I eat right when I get home, around 5:30. We did pretty well by going to Subway as opposed to McDonald's or something, but I had to go for the large sub. Brown bread, turkey, (no cheese or mayo,) just turkey, mustard, and veggies. That's not that bad, I suppose, but then when I got home I had about three handfuls of cheerios mix and some pickles. Could bemuch worse, but could bebetter.  I didn't drink 8 glasses of water today, I only had about 5 or 6, but I did get in the multivitamin. I went to the batting cage for a few rounds, and also walked for half an hour. I did it with a 3lb weight in each hand, which I was lifting the whole way. People look at you funny when you're walking down the road doing shoulder presses, but it was a lot more fun to do that than sitting in my apartment going 'I'm so bored!"   Now to get a bit rambly. I had a long talk with Ryan tonight (diabetic and 6-pack endowed,) and he said a couple of interesting things that I think I should share. One being that the sub bread alone probably contained about 300 calories (yikes) and also that I was right in cutting out the coffee. A direct quote: "If you're going to keep having cream in your coffee, you might as well pour it in a baggie and strap it to your thighs, because that's right where it will go." A little harsh, but he's right.  I then mentioned how pissed off I would be if I did this for a full month and didn't lose any weight, and he said, "Well then don't just sit around and wait for it to fall off." I pondered this for a minute, and realized that although it was the simplest concept ever, I had been missing it. Why aim for half hour workouts if I've got enough in me for hour long ones? Why go halfway? What am I waiting for? So although I've been doing OK for this past week (better than I've done the whole rest of my life,) I think it's time to up the ante. Why waste any time, you know? Better to go as hard as you can and see what happens than to fail because you only gave it halfthe effort that you were capable of.  I also want to say I think all of you are doing so well! Harshala, I can't believe you ate so many bananas, and you're doing so well with your midday exercise. And Kate, just remember that every little sacrifice puts you one step closer to your goal. Kudos on the lack of Doritos scarfing. Sharron, way to go on the 6 inch with no cheese. I know you're not a quitter at heart, so as long as you remember why this is important to you, I am certain you will succeed.   We rock!!
