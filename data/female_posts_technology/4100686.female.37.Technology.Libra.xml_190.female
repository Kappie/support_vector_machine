Jeffrey's claim;   Shako-Mako Iraqi News is around ten days old now and it is the ONLY blog where BOTH FACTIONS of Iraqi Bloggers have visited, posted, and given encouragement.  So far Faiza, Raed, Khalid, Majid, and the ITM brothers have stopped by and posted.  It is also the only blog that is half-serious and half-humorous about events on the ground in Iraq.   *Sigh* no Jeffrey, yours is not the only blog, nor the first. It's just that it has taken approximately nine months commenting on Healing, ITM and the Mesop for you to realise that it is possible to read Iraq blogs without taking up arms. Maybe one day you will also realise the fallacy behind the "Iraqi bloggers with/without comments" myth. lol. Check out blogroll to right >  But, Jeffrey does get credit for identifying  urlLink impostors.  Well, there you go Jeffrey, you got a link out of me anyway, there must be something in shameless self promotion after all. Asmar would know.  Oh, Tip Jeffrey: many bloggers aren't as innocent, forgiving and moesque linkers as IBC, you would probably have to link them  urlLink first  before they linked to your blog, esp after emails like that.  For anyone who doesn't know, Jeffrey is not that bad a guy, he has a loyal stable of commenters who have followed him from comments on other Iraq weblogs. Good on you Jeff, for helping to alleviate  urlLink Zeyad's  regular commenter burden.   Update;  The Commissar on  urlLink etiquette.
