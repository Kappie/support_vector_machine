The storm was so fascinating---the sky lit up different colors of blue and green with the lightning--I found out later that those were transformers being hit.  Saw ( met!) Bobcat Goldthwait at the Improv on Saturday!  What a nice person...actually quite shy!  Gina and Duane spent the night with me.  Sunday, G and I went to see "Little Black Book" while Duane stayed in to watch Nascar.  Jim got upset with me for not inviting him over.  I've learned you can't please everyone.  Ed is home, but haven't seen him.
