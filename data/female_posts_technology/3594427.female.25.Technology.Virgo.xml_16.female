So I decided to sign up for yoga classes 2x a week- Tuesdays and Saturdays. I've lost count of how many classes I've gone to, but I have to say it really works! My body doesn't feel so tight anymore and I can breathe easier. Plus, it is a good stress reliever! I'm still not so flexible but I'm getting there.
