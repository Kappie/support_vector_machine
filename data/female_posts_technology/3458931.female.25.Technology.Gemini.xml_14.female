I have pics from the wilderness that I will have to share later on.   I cannot BELIEVE that the Fredericton theatre is not playing Fahrenheit 9/11. God FORBID they play anything controversial in this town! Nonetheless, I will be driving my fuel-efficient Toyota to Moncton to hopefully get a seat at one of the evening showings there tomorrow.
