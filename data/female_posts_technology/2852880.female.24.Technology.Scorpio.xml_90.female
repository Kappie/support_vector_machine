Usually I only have one and that's probably one to many, but I'm having a splurge day today (3).  I heard Kirsty Allie had 14 sodas a day at one point, so at least I'm not that bad but I don't want to look like her either.  And I'm probably burning some of it off with all my booty-shaking in the kitchen.  Lots of energy today.  It's getting really close to the time when I leave Seattle.  14 days left.  That's pretty freaky.  I think the worst part is going to be all the goodbyes.  I HATE saying goodbye to people.  It's like the worst thing ever.  So if you're reading this and you're going to be saying goodbye to me, I think you should just skip it or at least keep it short.  Maybe a good luck and a hug.  Don't be insulted if I'm kind of standoffish during a goodbye.  It probably means I'm trying not to get sad.  It's kind of an emotional time and I'm a pretty dramatic person.  I hope my goodbye party doesn't end up with a whole bunch of sad awful goodbyes because I'll probably be drunk and it's harder for me to mentally remove myself from the situation when I'm drunk.  Maybe I'll just slip out right before the goodbyes start.  I guess that would be kind of rude.  Maybe I can just refuse the goodbyes.  I'll just be like - oh I have a few more days, I'm sure I'll see you again.  Later!
