Soon he was outside the tower. He listened closely at the door. He heard something move inside. He pushed the door open slowly.   "Hello." He said as he looked into the dark room.   "Oh my I have visitors. Come in and have some tea. I hardly ever have visitors. Please sit down." A wizard said across the room in the shadows. He appeared quickly with a kettle from the fire and poured a cup of tea. He pulled out a chair for Bardric.   "Oh I see you are a fellow wizard. It's so nice to see wizards now and then. I wish I could get out more but alas I can't. My work keeps me busy. Busy as a beaver." The wizard said with a laugh.   Bardric looked at the wizard's eyes. He didn't seem quite right. The wizard kept shifting his eyes left and right. He sat down where the wizard had motioned and held the cup in his hand. The wizard sat down across from him.  "So where do you hail from?" The wizard asked Bardric.  "From Tintown. Tell me how long have you lived here? You have a nice tower." Bardric carefully watched the wizard while pretending to drink the tea.  "I built this tower a long time ago. I remember so many fond memories here. Of course I like the solitude for I can concentrate on my studies. Did you know there aren't any bees here? I wanted to have honey but alas there are no bees." The wizard drank his tea.  "Yes I am sorry to hear that. Do you know what the Drakken are?" Bardric asked just on the off chance the wizard could remember.  "Why yes I do. Someone came here a few years back and asked me to do something for them. Of course because I am so nice I agreed. They took me somewhere. I can't remember where though. Anyways they asked me to remove an old spell. I did though it was too powerful I believe. I was completely knocked off my feet. I really don't remember much after that though. I'm sorry what exactly was your question again? I seem to have lost my train of thought." The wizard asked quickly.  "You were telling me about your tower." Bardric said kindly after realizing that was all the information he was going to get from the wizard.
