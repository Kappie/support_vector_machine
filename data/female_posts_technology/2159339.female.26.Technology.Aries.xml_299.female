Here is a  urlLink reference guide  if you are unfamiliar with my donut lingo. Who here doesn't speak donut? Hands!  Yesterday for lunch XX and I went to  urlLink Rudy's Can't Fail Cafe . They were voted "Best Fries" in the East Bay Express and it's a quick 2-minute drive from work, so we figured what the hey. He ordered a Patty Melt and I ordered a Reuben and we traded halves. Each plate came with a huge mound of perfect french fries, crisp and golden. And the waitstaff there are supercute, young, and hip. Confession: I'm in love with my waitress. She was full of smiles and wore a denim mini and metallic silver slingbacks. Yesterday I felt old and tired so it was nice to be attended to by a young girl with good looks and quiet charm. Truth be told, she's probably only a few years younger than me, but sometimes when I feel really bogged down I feel like I'm a 50 year-old woman. My inside age is probably my physical age, but in dog years. So that would make me... hold on... Start/ Programs/ Accessories/ Calculator... click click click... 182 years old. Yup, that's about right.   And since I'm officially old, I'm now on the lookout for badges that will reflect my wisdom and maturity:    "The Diet Starts Tomorrow"   "A Moment on The Lips, Forever on the Hips."   I will also consider these in a tasteful fridge magnet.
