Wormley, Jr. in his essay, FIGHTING BACK, talks of his difficult upbringing as an only child and he still was adjusting, at eighteen, when he was an army private at Fort Jackson, S.C. where a drunken white soldier attacked him during his sleep and the thought of fighting back had not entered his mind.  Later, he was confronted angrily by a young black street wise soldier wondering why he didn't fight back.   In a roadside diner in Virginia, Wormley was confronted again by a drunken white man making derogatory remarks at him. He did try ignore him and move but the man grabbed his shoulder. He pulled him up out of his chair and hit the drunk guy in the stomack, dropping him to the floor.   He thought of how this left him feeling good for the moment and then lost something by leaving him with a hollow feeling afterwards. In his upbringing, he was taught to think more than react. Fighting disgraced his black american population. He had a trace of sadness in knowing he had learned to fight back.  I found this essay sad in some parts. By this I am referring to race. It shouldn't matter what color you are. Wormley was judged by that; his color. I find this wrong. He was trying to do good for himself and drunken white ment were in the wrong by attacking him. They're the ones making white people look bad.
