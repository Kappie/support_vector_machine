Bardric wiggled to get into a more comfortable position while securing his pack and staff.  "Well maybe we should just leave these lands and let the Drakken have them." Trellian said crossly as he flapped his wings.  "I don't think that will solve the problem at hand. We are after all trying to help here not just cut and run. Though it is a nice thought. I would love to visit my tower at this moment even though I hate the thing." Bardric laughed at the thought.  "You're never serious for very long my friend. That could be a dangerous trait." Trellian flexed his wings before taking off into the air.  Bardric swallowed his words until the dragon had smoothed his flight. "Yes it could be dangerous but I also good at escaping." Bardric yelled as he grinned.
