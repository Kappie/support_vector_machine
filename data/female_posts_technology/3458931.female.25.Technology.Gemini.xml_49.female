Two loads of wash in, say, and hour and a half in separate machines. With one set of machines you get a backlog because the drying always seems to take longer than the washing.   I was thinking of going to see the Sunday movie downtown tonight but with Jasmin home that doesn't seem possible. Even with 10 hours of sleep she hasn't been having good days at the daycamp, I hope she has a god day tomorrow, I don't know what I'll do if she gets asked to leave another daycare.   Well I'm off to repair a broken arm on Jasmins' doll!
