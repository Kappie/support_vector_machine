There is one in particular I have been talking to in passing or about work projects -- a man from  urlLink Morrocco , home of  urlLink Casablanca !  Never thinking twice about it, but watching him sometimes while I am on the phone and being quite intrigued.  Yesterday, he surprised me by coming up and talking to me directly.  I was shocked and flattered simultaneously...a lot due to the fact I don't normally get THAT personal with others at work.  My daddy taught me long ago to never mix work with personal relationships....  After work we spent some quality time talking to each other and before we seperated our ways for the evening, he first kissed my hand and reached over for a kiss. WOW!  Am I going to have my own personal  urlLink Humphrey Bogart ?? or, just a short-lived moment??  Stay tuned for more details to come?!?!?
