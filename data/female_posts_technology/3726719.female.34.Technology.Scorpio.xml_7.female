I'm still walking funny with this hip situation going on. I did manage to get a little cleaning done at the house last night. Actually made it to the mailbox on back, so life is good. :o) It's still pretty uncomfotable. I'm hoping the heel lifts I ordered will get here soon. And I'm still trying stretches, though this isn't a pain a stretch is going to help.  And while I'm on that subject....why do medical professionals regard patients as imbeciles? I'm not stupid. I have an incredible capacity for learning. So my xrays looked great. No problems there. There is still obviously a problem with my hip. Okay so maybe something is torn or strained or twisted or something. Talk to me about it. Educate me. Enable me to help myself. Don't just stand there and say "well the xray was fine" and offer nothing else. If you don't know what could be causing the pain, then say so. I'm one of those people that like to take part in fixing what ails me. So emotional, spiritual, physical, or mental, I want a hand in correcting what's not right. I'm a participant in my life! Getting no answers or guidance from someone I look to for both is frustrating for me. And tends to lead me out to the internet, which can be a scary thing! :o)  Okay so off of that soap box and on to another one. Do people have any idea the impact they have when they exclude? Specifically, when I hear people making lunch plans and inviting everyone around me and NOT inviting me, what message are they sending? Is it intentional? Are they just not thinking? Are they making an assumption? Keep in mind that these people are my co-workers and we have gone to lunch before. Often. We get along just fine. So what is the deal today? I can tell you, being excluded does not support that whole team feeling.  Now for a lighter topic....consider me crazy (many people do)....I really want to see the movie Harold  Kumar Go To White Castle. It seems like a really stupid funny, just for laughs kind of experience. Maybe I can catch it next weekend.  As for this weekend, with no exercising currently on the agenda, I'm not sure what I'll end up doing. I picked up Messenger by Lois Lowry at the library yesteday, and still have Mort by Terry Pratchett that I borrowed from my friend Scott. If the sun cooperates, it could be a reading while laying out in my pool weekend.  Now I'm going to go home and hang out with the cats for lunch. Here's to a Fantastic Friday for everyone!
