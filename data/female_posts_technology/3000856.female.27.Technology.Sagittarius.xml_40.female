Sat went to dinner and on my way home Mikee called to hang out.  We went up to the bar where Jen works and hung out there all night getting free drinks and beer. We then proceeded to drink through the morning. Drinking my sorrows away.  I am in this deep depression for the past couple of weeks and it has gotten much worse over the last few days.  I don't know what is wrong me.  John probably thinks I am an absolute nut case.  I have been acting like such a bitch at practice and he is probably tired of my shitty attitude already. I just feel so alone, scared,and helpless.  I have this rough exterior, but inside I feel like that scared little girl still waiting for her mom to come back and take care of her.  Don't get me wrong my dad and my step mom did an amazing job and I love and respect them more than anything for being who they are and doing what they did. I just have this missing link that I am trying to find.  The problem is I think I was a mistake not only to my young parents, but I think god made a mistake by putting me on this earth.  I still have not found my purpose.  I hate who I am.  I sometimes think back when I was 16 and tried committing suicide.  I don't know if I should thank Sean for saving my life or hate him more for putting me through my own hell! I know I can be a better person, better mom, better daughter, better sister,and better friend. I have amazing people in my life don't get me wrong, but I am petrified of getting close to anyone because I 
    ALWAYS loose the people that I care and love more than anything, and I am the person that seems to drive them away! Take me away from all of this pain and suffering in this fucked up world. Make all of this go away.
