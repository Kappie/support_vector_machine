Forget the fact that what most of us are paid isn't much above poverty level, a title makes it ALL better.    But what's REALLY stupid is that it doesn't matter what your title is, you're going to have to do shit that has absolutely nothing to do with it. Now, I am not saying that I am above certain things, but when I am asked to do something that I have NO FREAKING clue how to do, and the person telling me how to do it is the person that is supposed to be doing it, I get pissed off.  Now, you don't know much about what we do here, so I'll give the readers digest version. We are a title research company. We search in the entire state for liens, bankruptcies, foreclosures, etc.  Our clients are title companies, attorneys and banks.  I started here in data entry. I had absolutely no clue what this business was about, and I'm completely serious when I say I was probably here for at least 6 months before I had an idea. (But remember, I can wear JEANS) I still don't fully understand every aspect of it. But that's ok.  Because I am now their "Network Administrator".  Now, I would prefer to not have that title.  That title gives the impression to many that I have some sort of Computer Science degree and that I am well educated in the workings of the computer world.  Well, I don't and I'm not.  What I do have is the ability to pick things up quickly with my technical mind (unusual for many females I am told). And I like computers.  That's it. And my boss figured that out one day after I explained how to do certain calculations in a spreadsheet he was trying to create.  So how the hell did I end up with this title? Back when I was still a data entry peon, and our boss was out of town, one of our servers crashed. The entire office went into a panic. The office manager called the boss. She couldn't explain what was going on other than we couldn't get into "Program X". She went into the server room and told him that it was stuck. Oh dear lord, what will we do?  We can't work, our families will starve, the earth will spin off its axis. She continued to panic. So the boss decided she couldn't handle the pressure of dealing with such a catastrophic situation and told her that she would have to let me into the server room.    *GASP* Are you sure????  There are computers in there!  She may touch one!  Nobody goes in the server room.  It's off limits.    I'm serious. They're funny about stuff here. It's all a control issue. Anyway, long story short, I went in there, rebooted the damn machine, logged in after he reluctantly gave me the adminstrative password, restarted the server and the client, and saved the freaking world. After that I became "Assistant Network Administrator". Now it's my full time job.  That is why I get so freaking pissed when I have to do things that aren't within that realm. As I said, I'm not fully trained in this arena. I know bits and pieces about tons of stuff, but sometimes it takes some real brain power to figure out why the hell the fax server stopped printing or where the hell our emails are going because they aren't going where they should.  So yesterday, I was told by a person in another department, the department that handles incoming client requests, to contact a client because they ordered the wrong type of search. I was like WTF? That's you're fucking job. Ok fine. Sent her an email (because you know people like us hate to talk on the phone). Told the client to order X search instead of Y search for the reason the director of operations and president had to explain to me because I didn't know nor did I care what was wrong with the way she ordered it in the first place. But I kind of had this nagging feeling that what they told me was wrong. I tried to counter with my opinion, but due to my lack of knowledge in the area of searches, my opinion was dismissed. And I got no response from the client. I figured she understood. So today the same person that dragged me into this in the first place told me that the client was still ordering the wrong search and I should contact them again. WTF??? So I did. And I got the response I expected. What I told her was wrong, her boss told her to order the Y search and the reason she gave me was indeed valid. Now I look like the asshole. Fuck it. Forwarded the email back to the director of ops and said you take it from here.    Let me know when the client can't place an order through the web site.  That I can handle.
