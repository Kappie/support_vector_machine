About halfway there we got to watch the sunrise which was pretty, but kind of a pain cuz we were travelling east at the time.  Arrived in St. Ignace around 9 am, bought our tickets, and boarded the ferry.  When we reached the island, one of the first things we saw was a GFS truck backed up to a horse-drawn trailer.  Now that is a strange sight.    Since it was still early and relatively we decided to lose ourselves in the park.  We followed the trails as best as we could, but they were too windy and confusing.  So we simply followed whatever trails we happened upon and enjoyed the fresh air and sunshine.  Walking through the park was certainly a contrast to the downtown area of the island.  It was so quiet and peaceful.  With the exception of a few other walkers, the odd horse and rider, and an occasional bicyclist, it felt like we were all alone.  It was rather nice.   After covering a major chunk of the island on foot we stopped at a little picnic area to eat our lunch.  From there we walked back to the downtown and wandered in and out of the various shops.  And of course we stopped to watch them making fudge.  We bought a sample box, and broke into it while waiting for the next ferry to come and take us back to the mainland.  Back in St. Ignace we wandered through a bookstore, then stopped for a bite of dinner at a 50s style diner.  The strange thing was, the diner had no tourists, it was all locals, even though it was right across the street from all the ferries.    A great, though very tiring day.  I have pictures to share, but I need to download them still.
