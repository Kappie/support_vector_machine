Seeing how I’m a lazy git and all, I’ve simply assembled some quotes from my viewing pleasures for your devoted worship and mirth. And I’ve called it a list so there’s another quota well met. First up, some quotes from Mil Millingtons’ latest. I learned some new bad words and the novel is set in Edinburgh. Hooray! (Oh! Speaking of Edinburgh-‘christ she’s going to force us to strike her about the head, isn’t she?’-It’s official, I’m going back! Double hooray! At the end of the year and if any of you want to come along that’d be swell. I know you won’t want to come you see, so I can make that offer and come off looking all polite and stuff. I don’t care if you don’t come, I’ll be having a blast and you’ll be jealous, you know you will, tossers. New years eve in Scotland, can you imagine? And winter would be the perfect time for all those brewery and gasoline distillery, aka whisky, tours I missed out on last time. Now if I can just convince my friend(s) there that they want to put me up. I can’t very well sleep in the bus station and I’m a bit old for the youth hostel. -and by a bit I mean a great deal-.Wow, that was a rambling mess wasn’t it? Back to Mil.) He manages to work in an Alyson Hannigan reference, which I didn’t include here, but still, that he did so is brilliant. Crazy Brit, he’s obsessed.  1) “London agents-bastards! ‘Oh, so you live up here? How wonderful. Wish I could, it’d be far better for my nerves.’ Twats. They need their shins beaten with a spade.” 2) “If you want to be a statue in Edinburgh, you have to hold  something . I reckon it’s a bylaw.” 3) “A clever tongue is a wonderful gift, so it is…but it always holds the danger of making me come over there and thump you, you wee English bastard.” 4) “It’s a matter of some pride, locally, that Princes Street has the highest mortality rate of any road in Britain.” 5) And several obscenities: A right old cockney geezer. Arse, piss drips and chips! A right slag. Bamstick.  One of the characters in this book is called the Vielfrass and he has all the best lines. To me the name conjures up some sort of prancing, vampire, beerish image. I’m considering taking it as my new nickname, soon to be scrawled in my third grade handwriting on golf balls everywhere. 6) “I am the Vielfrass. Yes, I see this information renders you speechless.” 7) Vielfrass: “I should perhaps state at the outset of our conference that I do not kidnap young ladies plying their ancient trade and cut them into easily portable pieces. How devastating it is to have to mention this.” Oozola: “Pooh! You sure like talking about it!” Vielfrass: “Silence, faithful floozy, or I’ll stab you cross-eyed.” 8) Vielfrass: “My child, if I have to repeat one more thing that I have hitherto made perfectly clear, I shall assuredly beat you.” 9) Yngyn: “Must you inquire into the affairs of every menial in the palace royal? What is it: an ingrained tendency to pry or simple nostalgia?”  I watched an Angel story arch because I saw that Drusilla was going to be in it (and yes, I’m watching them out of order. What can I say, It’s what I do.) and so she was along with Darla. I never liked Darla when she was on Buffy but I’ve got to say she’s much better on Angel. Maybe it’s the skanky haircut but probably it’s just that next to Drusilla, everybody gets a little insane aura working. 10) Dru: “I saw you coming my lovely. The moon showed me. It told me to come into the 20th century.” Angel: “It’s the 21st century Dru.” Dru: “Hmmm, I’m still lagging. (Slams him across the room with a shovel.)” 11) (Dru and Darla are standing in the middle of the street having just had a cat fight and now hugging each other and crying)  Guy: “You two wanna move it out of the street? Why don’t you and your girlfriend take the makeout session on home. The rest of us have lives.” Darla: “Not for long.” (she eats him) Dru: “You’re all new again.” Darla: “Let’s go shopping, hmm?” (They skip off down the street holding hands.) 12) Dru: “Oh, I’m ringing-do you hear it? I’m ringing-all-over! (Darla watches her for a moment then reaches down the front of Drus’ dress and pulls out a cell phone.) Oh, yeah. I forgot about that.” 13) Darla: “Why is everybody trying to make this all about Angel?! I mean, for gods sake, can’t a woman wreck a little havoc without there being a man involved?” 14) Darla: “You know, in a perfect world, Angel would be here right now, helping me burn this city to the ground. But where is he? Probably flogging himself in a church somewhere.” Dru: “Ooh flogging! Ew, churches.” And some fine remarks from Cordelia from the same episodes. 15) Cordy: “Ugh! It’s always the same. A smelly, old abandoned building. Are there no demon hideouts in Beverly Hills?” 16) Cordy: “Earth to retards: If you have an obsession you pretty much squeeze that into your schedule, no matter what!” 17) Cordy: (extra drunk)”Vampires, sloth demons-you know what’s really, really evil?  Tequila !”
