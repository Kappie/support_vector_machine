Until I learn, here's my 100 things, right in the middle of it all:  1. I am impatient 2. I am grateful that my husband is not 3. Impatience is my #1 vice 3. I drive fast 4. I pass and cut off people on the road if they are driving too slow 5. Don't hold this against me, I said I was impatient! 6. I hate people who drive slow on the fast lanes (if you frequent my blog, then I don't mean you) 7. I love to travel 8. I promised myself that before I turned 30 I will visit Paris 9. Now I'm not so sure because I heard that Parisians are rude 10. I don't like rude people 11. I'm a pacifist 12. I like to get along with everyone 13. But I am not fake 14. If I don't like you, I just will not talk to you 15. But I will still be polite 16. I don't like to buy on credit 17. I save voraciously 18. But I still like to spend 19. I wish I had the means to spend voraciously as well 20. I am a real-estate enthusiast 21. I believe in investing 22. I don't have the money to invest yet 23. I am not very religious but I do believe in God 24. I love surprises 25. I love kids 26. I want to name my daughter Yasmine Camille and my son Aidan Adile 27. If you steal these names, you will be cursed 28. I have a loud laugh 29. I have a loud sneeze 30. I can be moody 31. I have hang-ups about weight 32. Intellectually I think it's stupid to have hang-ups about my weight 33. But emotionally, I'm just a girl subject to the media's influence 34. That's why I rarely watch TV 35. Of the shows I like to watch, Friends, CSI and Frasier are my favorites 37. My favorite TV show of all time is a most secret thing 38. I will tell you anyway: it's Buffy the Vampire Slayer 39. I have all 5 seasons on DVD (there's 7 total but only the 1st 5 are out) 40. I am a Buffy fanatic 41. When I watch my DVDs of Buffy, I actually talk to the characters as if what I say will alter their behavior. 42. When my husband watches with me, he laughs 43. He says it is more entertaining to watch me watch Buffy, than to watch Buffy. 44. I had the Buffy  Once More With Feeling  soundtrack but I lost it 45. That made me sad 46. I am a Windows OS girl 47. But would like to learn Mac 48. I want to learn HTML 49. I want to learn Japanese 50. I want to learn Spanish 51. My husband speaks Spanish, French, German, Arabic, English 52. I am extremely proud of my husband 53. I am extremely protective of my husband 55. I am left-handed 56. I like SPAM 57. I like food in general 58. I dislike working out 59. Although after working out, I get that runner's high feeling that workout enthusiasts get 60. I am a little vain 61. Not a lot, because I think it's unattractive to be vain 62. Oddly, I am not that "girlie" 63. I rarely wear make-up 64. I rarely wear skirts or dresses 65. I dress more for comfort than style  66.  Right now, I badly need my eyebrows done  I finally got my eyebrows done 67. I like pedicures, especially French ones 68. I am a bit of a loner 69. I am very much a homebody 70. But I love people 71. I can sit in a park, mall, church, and just watch people 72. I like to think I am not judgemental 73. I love people from other cultures 74. I once sat at an Indian restaurant not too long ago with the following people dining with me: an American, a Chinese, an Indian, a Japanese, a Russian, and a Moroccan, and of course me, the Filipino in the group 75. I love other cultures 76. I once went to party that had the following people: a Mexican, a Venezuelan, a Peruvian, a Brazilian, an Ecuadorian, an African (don't know what country), a Moroccan, bunches of Americans, and me the Filipino in the group 77. I don't think I've mentioned it, but my husband is a Moroccan 78. He is also Muslim 79. Though not a practicing one per se 80. I used to have writing aspirations 81. I get horrified by people's bad grammar 82. I get horrified by my own grammar mistakes and spelling mistakes 83. I was born in the Philippines 84. I'm fluent in Tagalog 85. I moved to Canada when I was 10 86. I moved around in Canada about 3 times within a span of 6 years. 87. I moved to Texas, USA when I was 17 88. So now I hate moving 89. I am extremely close to my brother, Rhy 90. I am also close to my family 91. I have another brother, Jedd 92. He is growing up too fast 93. I am afraid to raise a daughter in the US 94. I think men have it easier than women 95. But I would choose to be a woman any day 96. I think we're prettier, cleaner, sexier, softer, and just make the world a better place 97. Imagine if world just had men (shudder) 99. But if the world just had women, I think we'll be just fine 100. But I think if my husband wasn't in the world, well, I frankly don't want to be in it.  Bow.
