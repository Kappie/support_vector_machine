Sometimes good, sometimes evil, mostly in between. But the characters on AMC are one-dimensional (unless you count bipolar as two-dimensional). I suppose it doesn’t really matter because the people that are going to see this won’t even get it (two of you maybe). Mostly I’m just entertaining myself. Could you do better? Probably if it weren’t for the job and the life and the normal hobbies that fill your time.   Kendall: Buffy-The obvious choice. Bianca: Willow-Perky and the girlfister angle still flies. Brooke: Joyce Summers-Brooke is the only character with an ounce of maternal instinct. Palmer: Giles-The only one with any sense. Greenlee: Glory-A hair flipping, fit pitching, ex god fashion whore. Yep, that’s Greenlee. Mary: Cordelia-Clearly superior at all times. Erica: Drusilla- INSANE . Tad: Xander-Smarty pants. Maggie: Dawn-At first I thought Lily should be Dawn because the kid that used to play Lily became Dawn but then I remembered that Dawn was a key and a key is a tool and Maggie is a huge tool.  Opal: Anya-Entertaining nut jobs, the both of them. Simone: Faith-Have you ever seen Simone pitch one? 5x5. Aidan: Spike-Oh, pretty. And Bonus, smirking accent. Adam: Principal Snyder-Equal parts teeth gnashing and superiority.   David: Wesley-Sneaky, brooding gits. Michael Cambias: Angel-“oh I’m good, oops now I’m evil. Look at me, back from the dead.” Reggie: Oz-Adorable  and  hip and happening. Babe: Harmony-Babe is still in cheerleader Harmony mode. Time will tell if Babe can become vampire Harmony. Ryan: Riley-Big lug head. At least Riley was cute. Maria: Tara-Yeah that’s the best I could do. But you know, nice racks. Jackson: The mayor-I went for the politeness factor. Well, that and the big cheesy grin. Boyd: Andrew-Prancing nancy boy. Jamie: Jonathan-So, so cute. And so, so vacant.   Stuart: Clem-HaHa! Myrtle: Halfrek-Myrtle’s always going on about being from “carny folk”. And a vengeance demon is sort of like a carnival extravaganza.   Liza: Amy-Amy spent most of her time on the show as a rat. Just like Liza. Lena: Kennedy-yum. JR: Warren-Bad hair, pissy attitude, putz. Edmond: Robot Ted-Remember when robot Ted threatened to slap Buffy in the mouth? I keep hoping Edmund will threaten someone, possibly Maddie, that way. Mia: Buffy Bot-Again I say, HaHa!
