It is a horrid accident that happens sometimes. It happens rarely, if the mentor of the youth does his job well. For we, the shape changers, our most horrible crime is to kill a human. We believe our purpose here is to protect the weak bodies of humanity. For the millennia we've been here, that has been our only work and our major principle. We call ourselves  les griffés,  the Clawed  Ones.
