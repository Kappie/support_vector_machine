       
      Since the beginning of May, I've been changing my life around a bit.  In a desperate attempt to lower my chronically high blood pressure levels, I quit my job, and devoted myself to my health and hobbies as much as humanly possible.  (I've since got another job, but I work at home full time now.)    I cut back on soda, chocolate, doritos, sweets, and started replacing as much as I could handle with whole wheat, fruit, jello and low-sugar items.  I also purchased what I feel is the best workout DVD on the planet:  urlLink Paula Abdul's Cardio Dance .    Doing that workout 3-4 days per week and adding some extra walking to my daily activities, I am very proud to say that I have lost 14 pounds in 7 weeks to just 218.  My goal is to be down to 199 by Hawaii, and to hopefully fit into the seat on the long flight to Oahu.  We leave on September 2nd.  I might just be able to make my goal!
