It's not even halfway done, and I think it's almost 3 feet.  So...what to bring?  I should make something out of the 2 skeins of beige-y Koigu I have kicking around.  Gloves?  BTW, I put two more batches of Kureyon up on my give-my-yarn-a-good-home page.  I think if something goes unclaimed for a week, that's when it goes on eBay.  Projects I've neglected the past few days: the sweater and Charlotte.  My friend Tiffany admired my entrelac swatch today (I hung it on my bulletin board, because I'm a dork like that.)  Of course the non-knitter appreciates the most fiddly, complicated thing I've done!  *grin*
