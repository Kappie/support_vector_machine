My earlier entry 'Chronicles from Land of Arabia' had done lots of heart-touching  urlLink   , on the other side of my blogsite. I'd even email this link to the Shahidah's party, while giving an online feedback of the whole trip.   Apologies to the one-third *and most senior* of the 3 Abdul aka Fadly. I don't mean any harm of the statement of chasing-the-dutch-girl. Initially, I came here to delete the statement. But later, I decide, it SHALL stay, for the sake of hilarity. Don't you mind, ok?   And so sorry too, to hear both your film rolls, kaput. Insya Allah, I will upload most of my already well-developed 6 rolls in this website. You choose, we develop, at no cost. Or like my hubby's saying, we 'Chak Kopi'  urlLink    one fine day to view the photos.  My China-man superior is not back yet today as scheduled. I haven't seen him since the day before Vesak Day. I understand he flew off to Beijing, and later Xi'an on the weekend after I flew out. Mystery. Is he still in China? Or, was he ordered quarantine (read: SARS). Or, his airplane got hijacked. Or worst, blasted off  urlLink   . Liza, quit your wild thoughts.  I used this opportunity of being protocol-less, by modifying or rather doing add-ons on this rather mundane site. See the more links, message boards etc. I know, this site won't be frequent as much as the other one. Yet, I love this site more. Strange.   On the meanwhile, stay tuned. And I can't wait to end the day, and finish my readings on Hanif Kureishi's Intimacy.  urlLink
