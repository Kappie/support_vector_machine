Mercifully at 8:30 PM, I was done with the reports I had to finish, so I had enough time to run to the mall and catch Spiderman 2.  I wasn't really expecting much when I bought my ticket. I was just glad that a new movie was opening this week. With Singapore being the most boring place on earth, the only things I have to look forward to every weekend are the new movies. I mean, I enjoyed the first film, but I didn't feel like I would like to watch it over and over again.  I found myself pleasantly surprised that within the first 10 minutes of the film, I already felt a lump in my throat and I struggled to hold back the tears in my eyes. I actually cared about this character- Spiderman! Normally, when we watch films based on super hero characters, we feel no sympathy for them whatsoever because we know they have powers that give them advantages over the rest of humanity. However, Tobey Maguire manages to portray the vulnerability and internal conflict of Spiderman without having to resort to cheap acting tricks lesser actors would use. He shows us that super heroes DON'T have it all.   After the Green Goblin in the first movie, we all ask how much worse could the next villain be? In comes Doc Ock, who is brilliantly portrayed by Alfred Molina. He's more powerful, more brillant and even smarter than Green Goblin. His experiment has even greater potential for destruction. One of the best things I have always appreciated about this series is that the villains are not one-dimensional caricatures of what it means to be evil. They fully explore the possibilities of this one statement, "There is a thin line that separates genuis from madness."   I love this movie because unlike most action films, this one finds its heart in the story and does not rely too much on the improved special effects. Everything in the script is tied so neatly together that there are no loose ends we have to figure out. You know why one character is there and you know the future roles they will play in the sequel if you are familiar with the original Spiderman comic books.  Although this movie has many sentimental moments, it manages not to become melodramatic. They don't extend the emotional scenes beyond the point that would make it cheesy instead of effective. You really see how the characters have grown from the first film. More importantly, the movie emphasizes the importance of choice and responsibility. Too often we blame our situation on fate and destiny forgetting that we are the ones who make the choices that shape our lives for better or for worse.  I'm definitely looking forward to Spiderman 3 now! If it still has the same cast and the same director and the same scriptwriters, I'm sure it can only get better.
