It might work well enough for perfectly groomed actors surrounding a plastic corpse in a fake bodybag, but it does nothing in real life when you're dealing with a bowl of week-old guacamole.   If it was in any other bowl I would toss it. Okay so I took it to the bathroom and started to rinse it out in the bathtub. Unfortunately the fuzzy black stuff that the guacamole has mutated into came off in sheets and started to clog the drain. This is when my stomach started to loose structural integrity and I had to make my exit.  Guacamole - 1 Amy - 0
