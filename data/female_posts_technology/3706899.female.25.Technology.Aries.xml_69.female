I tried to work on F-and-F on the bus trip to Boston, but the seats were way too cramped to work on her with The Boy sitting beside me.  I did start a swatch for the master knitting program...the seed stitch one (#3?  I don't have the sheet in front of me.)  The only reason I could is I bought shorter size 8 needles earlier that day...just for the sole purpose of knitting the swatches :-)  They'll be useful for scarves later.  It looks pretty decent.  I'll probably redo it anyway, because I'm having real problems getting my cast-on even.  You'd think I have plenty of practice now, but the whole time I've been knitting (including the knitting-a-whole-bunch-of-nothing when I was younger) I always used the knitted cast-on.  I could never get the hang of the basic one-needle one...none of the pictures I'd ever seen ANYWHERE made it make any sense to me.  Then a few weeks ago I told myself that I was going to learn it and I was going to like it.  I've nailed the first, and I'm making myself use it every time I cast on for something new, but I still don't have it perfectly even yet.  Which means I don't really like it yet.  (Any tips, anyone?)  Last night I managed to get a few rows done on Charlotte (I've started color 4!) and I started Sarah's HP scarf this morning.  I think I'm also going to make her a condom cozy (a la  urlLink summer Knitty ) in Slytherin colors.  Bwa ha ha.
