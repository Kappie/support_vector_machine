When I got home and checked my mail, my parents had sent me Hershey's kisses for Valentines Day and a cool little silver heart container thingy.  Very cool.  I have it on my desk at work.  I'm pretty much spoiled.    It's been a great great day.  Blue sky and sun all the way.  I have a lot on my mind and it's all good.  I'm feeling very optimistic.  There's so much I want to say that I feel like I can't because this is public and I didn't make it anonymous.  I guess I'll have to keep my private thoughts somewhere else.
