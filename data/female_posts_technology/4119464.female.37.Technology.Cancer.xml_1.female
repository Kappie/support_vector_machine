Myself I will probably panic on Monday morning as I log into my computer for my first shift. In the meantime, it's Friday and that means in a few short hours I get to hang out with the girls for the weekend. YIPPEE!      Yesterday after work, we changed and went to the beach with my sister and her kids. We hung out there for a couple of hours and then went out to eat. A couple of truths about that are: 1. I love the beach...but hate the sand in my shoes afterwards (and the many other places I find it). 2. I love not having to cook when I've had a long day....but, for the most part, I hate take-out food.      It's the weekend and there's a lot to do around the house. We finished papering and painting the kitchen last Tuesday but I have not had a chance to get everything back in it's rightful place. I intend to put a lot less back then was originally there and intend to trim in other areas as well including the computer room and the living room.       Another truth, the amount of work that gets accomplished around my home is directly proportional to how nice it is outside and/or how many children are hanging out in the living room. However, I love hanging out on the deck while the kids play in the yard and do not consider that lost time at all and I also love having the kids in the house doing crafts, playing a game, dancing around the livingroom taking turns doing kareoke or just watching a movie. So if we spend quality time together, chores get put off and the furniture accumulates a little extra dust...so be it.    It is suppose to rain so we might actually get some things accomplished around the house and if not we'll have fun ignoring the work. Thanks for reading...that's all I have for today.
