So I guess that I one less thing that I have to worry about now. I do apologize.   Well I had my weekend all planned out and then they called. They being Duane's parents. They want to come up and see the kids. I had plans with the kids to go to mom's camp for the weekend because Duane is working. But no they want to come up on Sunday and get a hotel so the kids can swim indoors at a pool instead of enjoying the beautiful weekend that it is suppose to be. His mom won't come to our house because of the dog. We have lived in the house for almost a year now and she had only visited twice, once when we moved in, and they stayed at a hotel, and this was before he got the dog, and they said Christmas eve night at the house and left at 9:30 on Christmas morning. They also came to Fredericton on other time and didn't even come to the house at all. Oh Dave, duane's dad came up for Madison birthday party and she mom just conveniently took a shift at work on the same day so she didn't have to come. It makes me feel like our home is not good enough for them to come and spend time with us there we either have to go to their home in saint john or meet them somewheres in Fredericton. All well, I guess it is less time that we will spend with them. I guess that was another rant for the day.   Well we are still going to go to the camp on Saturday and come home Sunday afternoon and meet up with duane's parents, thank god he is off work at 5.
