It's either he exists, but is probably gay or probably married. Or maybe he doesn't exist at all.  After my friend  urlLink Cecil  pointed out that my dream guy is defintely gay, I decided to test out her theory. You know how Blogger can link you up with people with the same interests as you? So I clicked on one of my favorite films and found a list of people who also had that same film on their own lists. I clicked on one of the profiles and voila, of course the person turns out to be a gay man who absolutely enjoys baking.   Everytime I tell my sister that I am interested in someone she automatically tells me, "I bet he's gay!" My boss here in the office is afraid to be seen hanging out with me because he's afraid of being mistaken for a gay man. That's because he just assumes that every single guy I hang out with is probably gay. I also have a reputation even in the Singapore office that I don't really know any straight men.  I don't care about what other people think about me. What is important is my friends know who I really am. I really just don't discriminate against people. If they are friendly, good and smart, it doesn't matter who they are or where they came from.  I'm still hoping to find my dream guy one day. If I never do, it's okay. Being alone isn't so bad. I believe the greater tragedy in life is choosing someone only because he was available and convenient. I don't want to spend the rest of life with a guy wondering if there was someone better out there for me. If I am to love someone again, I have to love him unconditionally, but hopefully not blindly anymore.
