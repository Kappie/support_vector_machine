It's basically a restaurant/bar in a movie theater.  They purchased an old mall-based movie theater, took out every other row of seats and replaced them with bar tables.  They have a full menu (mostly bar food like sandwiches and appetizers, but to their credit, a huge selection of pizzas) and a wide selection from the bar.  Where else in Houston can you drink beer and watch a movie on a full screen?  If you know of a place, comment here.    One of the best/most inconvenient things about the Draft House is that they don't allow in anyone under 18 without a parent.  That's for any movie, including Shrek 2.  The problem is that no matter how old you look, you get carded to get in.  I went earlier in the day yesterday to buy the tickets, figuring that we'd save ourselves from standing in the long line.  They would sell them to me, but I couldn't take Wayne's ticket because I didn't have his ID.  We just left them there and picked up later.  The good thing about this system, though, is the lack of unsupervised teenagers running around the place acting unruly and being noisy.    So how was the movie, you ask?  Well, I was told that movie was supposed to contain a lot of naked men.  While this didn't turn out to be the case as much as I thought, I wouldn't take children to see it just because of the suggestive content.  It was actually pretty good.  The historical element was nice, because if you've read The Iliad, you can tell where they're going with the storyline.  I like Orlando Bloom, but they make him look like such a little brat in this movie.  My criticism there is that the directors didn't spend adequate time building up the love story between Paris and Helen, then we're left wondering why it was worth it for the two nations to go to war.  There were other love stores which I believe were better told in the movie - Hector and his wife, Achilles and Briseus.    Overall, it was worth the $7 to see the movie.
