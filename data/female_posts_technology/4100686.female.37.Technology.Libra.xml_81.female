I stare at the ceiling and wonder if it is worth getting up. Iraq braces itself. The world braces itself. I remember people staring listlessly at news stands, public transport is very quiet, only the clatter of heels on peak hour station platforms, a glazed and news fatigued population on its way to work. The day the UN resolution is abandoned a stealthy silence falls, an unreality bomb drops on the western world. Most of us become small mammalian creatures scuttling towards our small securities, our burrows.  On this day last year, in a southern hemisphere city.
