She was 100% "daddy's little girl".  Not having a dad - I can't relate.  But, I was so touched at his funeral.    First of all, the place was packed.  Standing room only.  Everyone who knew him came.  How wonderful it must be to know someone you loved, was loved by so many others.  He must have been an amazing man.  The out-pouring of love was phenomenal.    I was doing just fine - no tears - until Cindy went up to the podium to speak.  Woah, Nellie - that's when the water-works started.  Hearing how much she loved him and was feeling his loss, hit me really hard.  Cindy's little brother spoke too.  He was sweet, and funny. It was amazing that they could make us laugh.   They , the bereaved - making  us  laugh.   Their whole family was amazing.  They had a capacity for humor which is rare.  It moved me that even through their tears, they were able to laugh,  and  make us laugh with them.  Very special group of people, Cindy's family.    I must admit to being just a tiny bit jealous of the relationship Cindy has had with her father, and her extended family.  She knows who her 4th and 5th cousins are. :) Which I find amazing.  I know who a couple of second are. But I don't think I could name more than two.  Not growing up in a close, loving family environment like theirs - it's hard to relate.  But I know that it is something rare and special they have.  I really wish my own dad could have been a part of my life, growing up.  So, I could have some of those same strong feelings that Cindy has.    Something else very special about this family is their relationship with God.  Everyone of them, knew that the deceased was close with God.  They had his worn, highlighted bible to prove it.  .  But it wasn't just that - he showed it by actually walking that "path" the clergy is always talking about.  By the amount of love he showed his fellow man.  Not just the love he showed his family.    Everyone who knew him, loved and respected him.  Also, his family felt assurance, that while he isn't with them anymore - He is now with God.   I haven't encountered that before - Complete assurance that your loved one has moved to a better place.  They were sad.  Very sad - but happy at the same time.  Happy that he was with God.  I tell you what... I felt challenged by it.  Challenged to better develop my own relationship with God.  To walk with love.  To be more like Cindy's dad - whom I never met.  But I wish now, that I had.  Have a nice weekend - and do something nice for someone else!!! cutesox
