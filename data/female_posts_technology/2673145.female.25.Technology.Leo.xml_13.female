Its cheaper and there's more designs of billabong, rip curl, quiksilver, rusty, roxy, stussy, mooks, etc.  some locals are very persistent to do biz w u. some are really nice and friendly. however  most of the salegals i encounter w are unfriendly, lazy and they show u faces. but the guys are friendly and didn't mind making the many trips to the store room. overall, i find the locals in bali are nicer then in most places. (although they keep thinking we are japanese, indonesian.. only one got it right by speaking Mandarin to us.)  it's a short trip. not fantastic but a good break. i'm so broke that i'm sticking to my $2-lunch for as long as i can.
