I figure if I link the food blog to this one, I'd be more accountable.  Well, we'll see.   The food blog is designed to point out flawed patterns in my eating, the end goal being establishing healthy eating patterns.  Again, we'll see.  ***Edited to Add***  Sorry for the original misleading title. I honestly don't know how to cook well. I know 5 recipes that I recycle. I'll post that if you guys want.:)
