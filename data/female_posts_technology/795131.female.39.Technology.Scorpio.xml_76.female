I don't think I look any different, but I do feel better! I've been attending American Sign Language club at a local Barnes and Nobel on Friday nights. I figure if I learn and retain 3 new signs each time, then it is definately worth the 60-90 minutes I spend there.  We took our kids and a neighbor girl to see Harry Potter on opening night a few weeks ago. In spite of the fact that the place was packed with families with kids, we got stuck sitting behind this angry, childless, 20-something year old girl who kept turning around and complaining only to ME that she just couldn't enjoy this (children's!) movie because my 5 year old son was figiting in his seat and asking us pretty much the same questions about the movie I could hear coming from all the other children the whole time. My husband laughed all the way home about her, but I fumed for 2 says straight!  I've also tried to go back to working at Sams Club on week ends, and I've tried to apply to other stores such as Target and Barnes and Nobel, trying to pay off the huge dental bill our family has run up over the last year, but no one is hiring at the moment.   Both kids are in a local YMCA day care at a local middle-school for the summer. For once they're both in the same place, and my 5-year-old son's behavior has matured so much in the last few days, now that he's surrounded all day by older kids and not by toddlers and other pre-schoolers!   Last week end we drove to Green Bay for my husband's 42-year-old female cousin's wedding. We drove 7 hours in a total thunderstorm with monsoon-like rain, thunder, lighting and sometimes even fog. That drive normally takes 5 hours or less. The best part of the wedding was the scandalously dressed under-age teen age cousins, looking like the Hilton sisters! I'm so old, I can litterally remember them when my husband and I were first dating, and they were babies.   It's mid June! We should go to the beach! I live near 2!
