Anything else (Coupling, Six Feet Under) would require that I have a satellite dish.  I would need an American dish (slightly illegal) if I wanted BBC America  HBO - which I do.    The reception in Toronto is better than in Mississauga.  In Miss. I would have to move the antenna each time I changed the channel.  In TO there are only a couple of channels that I need to adjust for - one is the WB out of Buffalo.  The WB is bad reception because it's not being broadcast in Canada, TO just happens to be close enough to Buffalo that we can "eavesdrop" on their station.  And I did a few years at university without cable.  In NS you only get three english channels: CBC - which was too fuzzy to watch, Global and CTV - these two would *fuzz out* if a big truck drove by   I do watch my fair share of TV, though I watch less and less all the time.  I hate all those reality shows.  Even Canadian Idol (sorry Mum.)  And there haven't been any good new sitcoms in years.  Just crap.  Once I discovered "Joan of Arcadia" I never missed an episode - though sometimes I would set the VCR to tape it. I don't have a VCR since I got my own place all I have is a DVD player, so I'll miss some episodes in the fall.  I'll just have to read the recaps on TWoP then.     Here is what I try to watch on a regular basis:   Joan of Arcadia  - my theology degree pulled me in on this one.  I like seeing how the depict God without really tying it into (one) religion  The Simpsons  - but I don't worry if I miss a new one, they will be in syndication forever.  I'm sure there will be a 24/7 Simpsons channel  Gilmore Girls  - I just started watching last summer (a few repeats) and caught the new season.  After the season finale, I am officially hooked   Shows I will watch if I feel like watching TV and none of the above shows are on:   CSI, CSI spin-offs  - Miami is good for a laugh - I really dislike David Caruso and his character, but Rory Cochrane is kinda yummy; NY - I'm not gonna bother; Original - has gone downhill lately  Alias  - the first season was fantastic, the second season started out okay and then faded.  Was there a third season?  That's how boring the few episodes of S3 I saw were   Shows I download, but don't feel guilty about because I have paid them money in some way:   Coupling  - I own the first 3 seasons on DVD, and will buy the fourth once it becomes available.  I don't think season 4 has aired in Canada yet - it's not finished airing in the UK  Six Feet Under  - I rented the first season on DVD and will be renting the second season soon.  I haven't actually downloaded any episodes yet, but season 3 started recently, so I may  Gilmore Girls  - For the season finale the Canadian carrier (Global) was a week behind the US carrier (WB) because of a documentary they aired.  I couldn't make the WB watchable on the night they aired it so I downloaded it over the weekend (instead of waiting until Wednesday on Global) and watched in many times.  Then I watched it when Global aired it.  So I haven't really paid money for this show, but I only downloaded one episode and I am still subjected to their advertising when I do watch
