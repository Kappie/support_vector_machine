Partially because I become bored with it, but mostly I just don't have the time. Lately I've been flipping furiously through techie books in order to quickly pick up new concepts for a project. Usually that kind of learning is fun. However, lately it just seems to add stress.  My journey to Barnes  Noble today has sparked a desire to do more personal reading this summer. Lately I've felt like this horrible let down to society because my repertoire of books does NOT include many of the classics. There are so many fantastic novels out there that I haven't even touched. I'm almost embarrassed because of it. I don't count the required readings in high school and college, as if some of those are noteworthy any way. Reading for enjoyment and reading because you have to are two different things. Anyway, Barnes  Noble is running this fantastic book deal for many literature classics. Buy 2, get the 3rd free. I love a good deal! So, for my reading enjoyment and curiosity, I've picked up the following:  Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe The Time Machine and The Invisible Man by H.G. Wells Beginning J2EE 1.4 (Ok,ok. I couldn't resist the Java book. It was on sale!)  My current problem is deciding on which one to read first. I'm stuck between Chuck Dickens and Wells. I highly suggest taking up on this book offer. It ends July 1st. Run to a local Barnes  Noble near you! They're everywhere. Just like Starbucks.  Enjoy the moment and seize a good book. Challengingly, Pinkie
