My bag is on my lap, left hand holding a biggie size Coke and my right holding a paper bag that contains fries from McDonald's.  Squeezed like that and maybe looking harassed while drinking and eating fries, I sighed in relief when one on my left stopped at City Hall.  More space for me and my bag and my elbows.  I hoped that no more passenger will hail this fx and squeeze in to make us four again, but then I thought that maybe it's the driver's first drive this morning so it's a pity if he doesn't earn and I said okay fine God's will.  Right God?
