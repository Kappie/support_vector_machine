I found it interseting how first of all the Hindu Man's crime was never menntioned. I think that made one to wonder if a crime had even been committed. As the writer uses extreamly descriptive words he leads us with him on that fatefull morning that a hanging occured. WE are able to follow the superintendants every step of the way to the final hanging. I do wonder what signnificance the stray dog had to the man and the story. I think that the writer was trying to make a connection to animals and humans in pain.
