Today I was talking to my Mum on the phone and realized we are very different (and she's a little odd.)    We could have a great run if we were on Broadway.  Here are the players: Mum - the one who raised me all by herself for 13 years (and did a bang-up job!) Dad - he's actually my stepdad, but he's the only one that counts little Bro - not really little, he's 23 now, just little to me Nannie and Papa - Mum's parents Two aunts - Mum's sisters One uncle - married to an aunt One almost uncle - in a long term relationship with the other aunt One cousin Assorted aunts, uncles and cousins on my Dad's side - I'll go more into that later Biological father's family - not major roles, we call him "Jo=Jo the sperm donor"
