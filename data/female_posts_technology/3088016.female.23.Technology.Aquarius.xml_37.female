How sick is this?  I can't even stand to eat something that I knew was alive a few hours before (see Crawfish Boil post).    I like the  urlLink New York Press   urlLink idea  the best: take off the rubber bands and make it a fair fight.  If the man gets the claws off without losing one of his own, the lobster loses.  If the lobster gets in any shots, then he gets to die the humane way in a boiling pot of water.  This kind of stuff would make me want to be a vegetarian... if I didn't like meat so much.
