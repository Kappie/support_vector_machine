Dunno why I did but I think it was a God thing. We had a great time. I was in charge of the Bounce House *wicked evil grin* for the first couple hours, managed to go on *big kid* Slip-n-Slide twice. I quit after hitting my face on the ground. Ouch! We had a BBQ, great worship music, Ju and her friend La and her kids and well, basically a bunch of kids I know and love were there. Had a great time with everyone. TONS of fireworks at the end.   Basically a mmmmmmmmm yes, good day. :)  Happy 4th Everyone!
