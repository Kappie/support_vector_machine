I know I don't look like an ogre, but I want to look better anyway.  That's the one hand.  On the other hand, I love food.  I mean I love it.  I already restrain my appetite, but if I knew I could eat anything and not gain weight I wouldn't. I love the way food looks, smells, tastes.  I love seeing the different variety of it, and when they touch my tongue, it is bliss!  I  wish  I didn't have this clandestine affair with food but I do!  So therein is my dillema. It's like a constant tug-o-war.    And tonight my appetite won.  Cravings ignited by  urlLink Toni's  recent blog about junk food, specifically, Filipino junk food, I finally relented to my cravings and drove out of my way after work to the Asian store we usually shop at.  I didn't even get a cart and good thing too.  The lack of a device to place my snacks in limited how much I could carry, thus limiting my purchase.    Here's a pic of my stash:     Still no Chippy! No Chiz Curls either.  All I could luck out on was Clover Chips (Ham n Cheese flavor) and Nagaraya (Garlic flavored).  I experimented with the party mix (Thai brand and has seaweed wrapped around some of the mix).  Everything else is tried and true.  I bought two bags of Grill-A-Corn, which I imagine is what Oishi's Oheya tastes like, but I'm not sure.  They didn't have the Oishi brand name.  Hubby and I already finished one of the Grill-a-Corn bag....Okay, I finished it.
