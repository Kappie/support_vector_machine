Of course, the question arose because I'm dating someone new, but also things have been happening to people I know that contrast each other and have weird timings.   Two weeks ago, one friend that is in a rather idyllic relationship for the past two years (July 2002) with a real sweetheart mentioned nothaving a shiny bobble on her left hand. (Note: she wasn't complaining, just mentioning as part of another conversation.) These two really do seem "perfect" for each other. In the past two years, both have really grown as individuals and at the same time grown as a couple. Pretty awesome. Yet still a naked third finger.   The next day I went to lunch with afriend that has barely knownher husband for two years. They met in February/March 2002, dated 6 months (he's a pilot, so has a weird travel schedule), he got sent to Kuwait for 6 months with the Army Reserves but 1/2 way through came back and they got married (October 2002). So in Feb/Mar 2003, about a year after they first met, her husband returned.   What a contrast. Not that one relationship is better or stronger than the other.It's just odd how two different relationships move at such drastically different paces. I hadn't thought about it before, but the timing of the two conversations made the timing differences stand out.   I would definitely say the love is there betweenboth couples. But that takes me back to the question of what is love......   Background info on my neighbors -- they've been living together for a year. The guy in the relationship has been more the guiding force in the relationship. He was the one that wanted them to move in, he's been the one talking marriage andasking about different ring styles, etc. She defiantly reciprocates the emotion.They had know each other for years before the relationship developed and it seemed very strong.  Last week, she came by to tell me they were moving. The prior Sunday he confessed that he had been seeing someone else since February. She said he came home from work (a paramedic/fireman) kissed her and said he loved her and took a nap and when he got up told her it was over. He said he wanted it to work and that's why he wanted them to get a dog together (so they would be a family), but decided he would rather be on his own.  Damn.   When I went back to work I was e-mailing with a former co-worker who has been married for TWELVE years and has for kids (but seems like it's nothing to have that many kids, she seems like a kid herself), who said she's leaving her husband. He knows and they are still living together while she saves money to get her own place. Once she does, they'll each take two kids and keep trading off (she laughed too). The kids are like 10, 8, 5 and 2 (the 2 y.o. was after a tubal ligation). She said it had been coming on for 8 years. She loves him, but not in that way. That seemed like a tight relationship. I remember one time he came to pick her up at work and we were talking about him running off with someone famous (can't remember who) and he said he's rather keep his wife and wouldn't want to trade her for anyone else. He didn't say it in a sappy way, but a content, happy way. Every now and then they would do super sweet things for each other -- little gifts, flowers, etc. That made it seem like a really awesome relationship. And now it's ending.....   I guess there is no guarantees in the world. And feelings/emotions change. So what's the point?    In Steel Magnolias, when Shelby was talking about her illness she said "I'drather have 15 minutes of wonderful than a whole lifetime of nothing special."  She's got a point there....   A former co-worker that was in her late 30s and not married had the attitude of "I'd rather never be married than be divorced."  She's got a point there.....
