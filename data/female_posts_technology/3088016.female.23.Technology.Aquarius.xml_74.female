Wayne has a digital camera that I figured we'd take to major events; problem is, I don't really get to play with it.  Lately, he doesn't either.    I'm soliciting all of your help.  There was a commercial yesterday that I saw on TV - must have been ABC during The Bachelor.  There were several women "doing lunch" at a fashionable little cafe, when they all go nuts and knock tables over because Steven Tyler of Aerosmith walks by.  One woman keeps her composure long enough to snap a photo of him with her very sleek, thin (size of a thin pack of cigarettes, maybe) digital camera.  She then proceeded to shows the picture to all of her girlfriends with the extra large view screen.  I can't remember the name of this camera, but it looked nice, and I somehow got the impression that it would be affordable.  If you see the commercial, please write down what kind of camera that was and let me know.   Wayne tells me that my purchasing style goes something like this:  "I don't know what it is or what it does, but it's pretty and shiny and I must buy it."  He's right.  I know it was pretty and shiny and that I want it.  Next, I need to find out what it was.  What it does (as in specs and features) will come later.
