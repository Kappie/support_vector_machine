She brought up the files and looked closely at them.  As far as she could tell the Genesis Project had something to do with viral warfare only it's been tested here in the streets.  Interesting.  Maybe not interesting since most of the victims die.  TKS.  She remembered when that particular virus ran rampant through the streets, killing children and elderly as well as a few in the middle.  If she remembered correctly it was raging one day and the next it was over.  She read a little further.  It says that as soon as the test had the results, the company released an antiviral to kill the virus.    She realized that she shouldn't be seeing this document.  She shouldn't have it.  She put the head gear back on and went to the VR club.  Brett was no where in sight.  Quickly she scanned her system and found a foreign object in one of the offices.  She quickly ported herself there.  Brett was there stashing the note.  "Brett."  She said as she entered the office.   "Hey.  That's cheating.  You're not suppose to come after the note until you hacked my system, left a note, and met with me in the club."  He said accusingly.  "I have a problem and we must speak on a secure channel.  Follow me now."  She grabbed his arm and took him to a room she built for herself that only she herself could enter.  "I hacked into your system or at least I thought it was your system.  Brett, I must know.  Do you actually administer all of the Genesis System or do you just administer the public part?"  "I think I just administer the public because I noticed a few systems running into my system and was told to never touch those that they had someone else to administer to those systems.  Why?"  Brett sat down on the sofa watching Kat pace the floor.  "I think I hacked into one of those systems.  I now have information that I shouldn't have and I don't know what to do."  She ran her fingers through her hair and kept pacing.  It seemed the only thing to keep her calm.  "What kind of information?  May I see it."  He asked as he stood in front of her to stop her for a moment.    "Yeah, just let me bring it up."  She walked over to a blank wall and gave a few voiced commands.  Soon the wall was covered with the document.    Brett read quickly through the information.  "Do you know if anyone saw you enter and leave the system?"  "No, I have no idea.  I felt someone coming but I left so I don't think they know who I am but they probably know by now that someone was in that office.   They might be able to trace me.  I don't know."  She ran her fingers through her hair and started to pace again.  "Kat."  Brett quietly said as he watched her pace back and forth.  "You know what you should do, don't you?"  "Leave.  Hide.  Disappear?"  She stopped and looked at him.  "Yes.  I think you should go somewhere where you have never been and hide.  I don't want you to be hurt.  I know what the corporation is capable of.  I found that out a few years ago.  I will take the first flight out of California to join you.  We'll think of something but hold on for now."  Brett said quietly as he pulled her into his arms and held her.    "Wait.  Do you feel that?"  She pushed him away and went to her security systems.  "We have to get out now.  They're coming."  "Who is coming?" Brett rushed over the systems.  "I see the Omikron and Green Genesis logos on those men so I guess we are both in deep shit.  Come, lets go out  the rabbit hole."  She rushed over to the desk and moved it out of the way.  "Rabbit hole?  What?"  Brett confused followed her.  "Alice in Wonderland.  Rabbit hole."  She saw the confusion on his face.  "Nevermind I'll lend you the book later.  Let's go."  She jumped feet first down the hole and back into reality.  Quickly she threw her gear down and grabbed her personal effects that she would need like money and credit cards.  She took the back way out of the building avoiding the elevators and main hallways.  She grabbed the monorail to the next city.   Maybe she should hide in the country but she would look out of place there.  She lived in the city for most of her life.
