Understand that we try ... let me take that back - I try to be a peaceful individual. However, people get drunk and try to get "boudy body bot" it. I have the ability of easily ignoring when people get stupid. Unfortunately,Trish did jump in to my defense and ended up hurt. We both took care of them however, and they look alot worse off, U'all wish her a quick recovery. To broken ribs are no joke! Love ya! Feel better!
