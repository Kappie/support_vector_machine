"If you do away with the yoke of oppression, with the pointing finger and malicious talk, 10 and if you spend yourselves in behalf of the hungry and satisfy the needs of the oppressed, then your light will rise in the darkness, and your night will become like the noonday. 11 The LORD will guide you always; he will satisfy your needs in a sun-scorched land and will strengthen your frame. You will be like a well-watered garden, like a spring whose waters never fail.   A continuation of a previous Isaiah reading, and says very similar things.  Pray to God and he will answer you. Ask him for help and he will provide it.  I think the "yoke of oppression" is supposed to be our sinful nature, so do away with that, don't be accusatory or judgmental toward other people, don't talk maliciously about them, spread rumors, or gossip, take care of people who need it -- people who are hungry or who need someone to stand up for them -- do all that and we'll be able to show the world what it means to be Christian, how our "light" (through Jesus) shines from the inside out.  God will guide us to where we need to be and will take care of our needs for us.  We'll have strength and we'll be able to flourish in whatever we try to do.  More good things to remember about how to behave, what to do, and how God will take care of us if we do these things.
