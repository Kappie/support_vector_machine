She didn't like this particular mission in such a small town.  These people did not deserve this sort of terrible act that she had to deliver.  She looked to her left at the tall solemn elf standing beside her.  His silver-blonde hair lay past his shoulders waved softly in the wind unmasking the sign of his heritage, his pointed ears.    The elves have always helped her on her missions.  He was the newest in the long line of succession.  The last one had to leave to return home so he could die within his homeland.  They sent his one in his stead.  She hoped that he wouldn't have to stay his whole life with her without his family or friends.  She sighed.  So many are committed to her and her missions.      At least this particular elf considered himself to be very modern.  The first day he chattered her ears off before she could get in with a reply to answer his questions.  He didn't always obey her but asked questions first to understand the situation.  She liked him.  There have been a few elves that she couldn't get along with and she would have to send them home.    "Well, let's go before I change my mind.  I really don't like this particular part of the journey, Lleywyn."  She said to the elf as she led her horse down the hill towards the town, the elf falling into step behind her.  "Tell me, Katlyn, exactly why are we here again.  I know you mentioned about watching over a little girl but why?"  Lleywyn asked as he walked beside her.  "We need to make sure that no one kills her before she is able to do whatever she has to do.  I am not even sure what she has to do myself but she has to.  I don't even know what the little girl looks like but I am sure we'll find her.  At least we always find the person."  She replied thoughtfully not completely sure of this particular mission herself.  Something keeps nagging her about this girl.  Something just doesn't seem right.
