Plus, I haven’t seen a “split screen phone conversation” in months, have you?)  I’m thinking a theme is in order (I’m all about the themes these days aren’t I?) Or, actually, a “character trait” drinking rule may be what I mean.   Every time Maria shows up and shoves her bodacious ta-tas at someone, take a drink. (What this really means is “every time Maria shows up”. Period. Because those ta-tas are automatically gonna get shoved.)  Whenever Erica a) flips her hair, b) changes her wig, or c) changes sides in the middle of and argument, take a drink.  Every time gauze is used over the lens…no, wait. That is too confusing. Just commenting on the gauze over the lens will be enough.  Every time anyone tells Kendall that they support her and think she is great or brave and strong then switches to calling her a back stabbing, greedy bitch in mid conversation, take a drink. (It’s also ok to take a drink if this is reversed and they start out calling her a bitch then switch to telling her she’s great.)   Whenever Aiden mentions that he saw David pouring scotch into a potted plant, finish your beverage completely. (You may think you’ve heard the last of this. You haven’t. There will be a trial. There will be flashbacks. There will be sweeps.)  Every time Ryan takes his shirt off, leave the room for more cheese or another beverage or to smoke or to go to the bathroom. If he is also doing pushups, do all of the above.  Whenever you can see Boyd’s lip liner line, take a drink.  When Maggie opens her mouth and the stupidest shit imaginable comes out, take a drink. If she ever says anything relevant or profound, quit drinking for the remainder of the episode. (Trust me, this will never happen.)  When Juan Pablo speaks, mute the TV, re dub his lines, then take a drink.  Are we drunk yet? I mean, I’m feeling a bit woozy and I’m just writing the stuff   If any of the following people are involved in a slap fight, a cat fight or even some hair pulling, take  several  drinks-Greenlee, Kendall, Lena, Anna (shut up, I know she’s gone, it’s  my  fantasy), Maggie, Bianca, Maria, Liza. (I am seriously obsessed with girl fights these days. What is my damage? Jeez.)   If anyone at all has a particularly amusing or clever line and at least one person watching the episode laughs out loud, take a drink.   When Michael shows up in undead zombie mode (are undead and zombie repetitive?) take a drink. (Trust me, he will be back. There will be Halloween. There will be bad dreams. There will be sweeps)   Even though they’ve forced Mary down, she’s not out yet. She still has the most amazing insults, at least 4 per scene. Whenever she gets a good one off, drink up.  When Opal swoops into a scene sporting some atrocious get up (which is always), drink up. But if for some unfortunate reason she and Mary ever have another cat fight, game over. Turn the TV off and go read a book or something.   If anyone ever arrests, slaps or insults Simone or Mia, take a drink. (Again with the slapping)  If we ever get the truth as to what happened the night Michael disappeared, finish off the bottle, flask, six pack etc. of whatever you’re drinking.  At the end of the episode you are watching, weep drunkenly for Anna being gone.
