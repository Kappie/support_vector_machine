I think I have been able to do it cause at the moment I have like $8 to my name, which means I can't take any money out of the bank machine, the stupid things only give out $20's. But I have eaten a lot healthier and have been tracking everything. So far 2lbs have disappeared, I am sure I will find them sometime. :)        I had two awful sleeps this week. Duane was off for two days and home with the kids all day. I told him not to ever take any days off when I was working nights again. I probably had like 4 or 5 hours sleep those two days he was off. He was constantly yelling at the kids or the kids were playing really load or the they would get the dog going and he would bark. So today I had a great sleep. Just me and the dog. I got home from the gym at 8 and fell a sleep on the couch for an hour or so and then moved to the bed. I woke up once to let the dog in the house and then didn't wake up again until 5:45. It was great.
