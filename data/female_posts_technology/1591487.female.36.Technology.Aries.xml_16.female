Obviously I don't have anything better to do than to obsessively check whether there is any new email on the server. And boy, am I disappointed when there isn't. This happens about, oh, a million times a day.  Additionally, I'm disappointed when I don't get any Instant Messenger messages either, people should know that I am sitting at my computer waiting to be messaged! Clearly, the reply to an instant message takes any precedence over any actual work being done.  Although I do admit to a certain level of pathos when I send an instant message to someone who is less than three feet away.   I unravelled about a week's worth of knitting the other night, I should have known better than to start knitting to a pattern I knew would not fit me. It seems that patterns are only tailored to Very Thin People living in Thinland.  I could have kept knitting I guess, however, I don't know that many small children who I would feel would like to wear a black jumper with scarlet feathered edges.    I may have to see if I can purchase a Knitting for Lardies pattern book over the net.  There's bound to be one somewhere.  Look! A weekend is looming, which is wonderful.
