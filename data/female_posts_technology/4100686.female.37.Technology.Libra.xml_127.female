This song was originally banned in the US, but Sarah Jones revolted, took the case to court, and won. Now the song is free to air, not that you'll be hearing it much, these days. Sarah Jone's lyric's reference her contemporaries indiscriminately, her voice expressively dripping with sarcasm and ruthless with disillusionment over the west's later 20th century sexual revolution.  Probably you may need to exercise the subversive cells in your brain to relate this to blog counting.    urlLink Your Revolution  ~ DJ Vadim feat Sarah Jones 1999  Your revolution will not happen between these thighs Your revolution will not happen between these thighs The real revolution ain't about booty size, The Versaces you buys, Or the Lexus you drives. And though we've lost Biggie Smalls,  Baby your  Notorious revolution will never allow you  to 'lace no lyrical douche  In my bush. Your revolution will not be you killing me softly with fujees Your revolution ain't gonna knock me up without no ring and produce little future M.C.'s Because that revolution, will not happen between these thighs. Your revolution will not find me in the back seat of a jeep with L.L.  Hard as hell,  You know "doing it an' doing an' doing it well",  You know "doing it an' doing it an' doing it well" oh no, u no Your revolution will not be you smackin' it up, flippin' it or rubbin' it down Nor will it take you downtown,  For humping around Because that revolution will not happen between  these  thighs. Your revolution will not have me singing "ain't no nigger, like the one I got" Your revolution will not be you sending me for no drip drip V.D. shot Your revolution will not involve me "uh' feeling your nature rise"  Or helping you fantasize Because, that, revolution will, not, happen between these thighs O no, not between these thighs, o no My naked brother, your revolution will not make you feel "a' bombastic"  "And really fantastic" And have you groping in the dark for that rubber wrapped in plastic, a' a' You will not be touching your lips  To my triple dip  Of french~vanilla butter~pecan chocolate~deluxe Or having Akinyele dreams, mhm A six foot blow job machine, mhm You wanna subjugate your Queen, aha. Think I'm gonn' put it in my mouth just because you made a few bucks? Please brother, please Your revolution will not be me tossing my weave  And making me believe  I'm some caviar eating ghetto Mafia clown Or me giving up my behind  Just so I can get signed  And maybe have somebody else write my rhymes I'm Sarah Jones, not Foxy Brown You know I'm Sarah Jones  Your revolution makes me wonder; where could we go,  If we could drop the empty psuedo-props and the ego We'd revolve back to our roots, use a little common sense,  On a quest to make love, De la soul, no pretense.  But, your revolution will not be you flexing your little sex  And status to express  What you feel  Your revolution  Will not happen between these thighs, Will not happen between these thighs  Will not be you shaking  And me *yawn* faking,  Between these thighs  Because the real revolution That's right, I said the real revolution You know, I'm talking about the revolution  When it comes,  It's gonna  be real It's gonna  be real It's gonna  be real  When it finally comes  It's gonna be real
