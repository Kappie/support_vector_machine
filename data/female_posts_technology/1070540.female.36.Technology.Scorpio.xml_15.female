My darling husband is so sweet,  besides being so patient with me, he has been holding me so tight, and even laying his leg across my stomach to put pressure on it to keep the pain from being so bad!!!!!   I know I have the sweetest husband alive!!  I do love him so much.     I have to put in an insert concerning my DR appointment.,  I can tell the meds he put me on are working,  I am trying to hard to catch up on the house and things so I can finally be caught up and continue to keep a clean home.  But we have been through alot lately, and my poor baby keeps getting sick and my sweet hubby even broke his leg....GOODNESS!!  I feel so bad for them.  The older kids have been ok.  Kimberly was put on some meds for ADD but I do not like that at all.  Austin has been acting up, but he is still so sweet.   He wants to live with me so bad just like his sister.  Terry jr, well he really tries hard to be good, but sometimes he has to let go.   I think its the BIG brother syndrome.  I am so happy I have 4 wonderful children.
