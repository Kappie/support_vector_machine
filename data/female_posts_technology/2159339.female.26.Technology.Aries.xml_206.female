All the bands were queer-identified, so Mission lezzies galore in da HIZZY! Too bad I don't like to eat pussy, because it was a veritable fest of lovely lesbionics. Did I ever tell you that I'm a wannabe lesbian? Lesbians are rad! The only thing stopping me from crossing over to lovin ladies is my infatuation with certain boys and my desire to fondle them.   urlLink Paradise Island  is a one woman band, namely, Jenny Hoyston, the singer of Erase Errata. I recognized her voice right away so her disguise of a bear hat didn't fool me. It was just her, an acoustic guitar, and a drum machine. Her post-punk singing is honed, but she needs some guitar lessons. She's got an album out already! Holy cannoli can a name get you a record deal! Call me old-fashioned, but I think record deals should be for those who can play their own songs. But I enjoyed her set very much. I'm just jealous that she has a record out and I don't.   urlLink The King Cobra  were awesome. Even though their bassist stayed home, the two chicks on stage rocked it. I had a gut feeling once they started, that they had to be the chicks from The Need. It was the stop-start angular drumming and the sputtery singing style of the drummer/singer. I knew it had to be her because she looked like she'd been drumming for decades. She was so self-assured and had no need for audience attention. Then at the end of the show I saw tattooed on the knuckles of her left hand: N-E-E-D. Yes! I am their new best friends!!! I loved The Need, and now, I love The King Cobra! Go lezzies!  Tracy and the Plastics I saw open the Electroclash tour, and she/they blew me away. It's only one singer, "Tracy", but she interacts with two alter-egos ("the Plastics" on a video screen, "Nikki" and "Cola"). In-between songs, they'll have actual conversations. And they're all so funny because they talk in exaggerated valley girl accents... like ME! And I love the music. It's electronic, but totally danceable and catchy, like The Faint. And the lyrics are sometimes abstract, sometimes heavy. This time around, the video girls even harmonized with Tracy when she sang! God, I love it!
