You are right to assume that I would be checking my email every 10 minutes on company time, because that's exactly what I've been doing...Yes, let's plan something. How about for Friday? I'm currently battling microorganisms that have made my throat and lungs their home, but will probably prevail by that time. I'm thinking sushi, but am open to other new  exciting possibilities.  Glad to hear you passed for a 'real' climber. You seemed pretty confident in your climbing ability and confidence is usually the best disguise for inability. Kidding of course. I'm sure you kicked some ice mountain ass.  OK. So if not friday, then any time next week would work as well. Just let me know what works for you.  ~A  ***************  From: 'Marcus' To: 'Abby' Date: Mon, 12 Apr 2004 11:43:36 -0700  Hey A-chan, Since you are probably on line, surfing sites of personal interest on company time i thought this would be the best way to reach u. Back home now, ready for feasting and debriefing on my experience as an undercover field operative. My cover was never blown, people actually believed i was a competent climber so i was able to gather lots of sensitive intel from my unsuspecting contacts.  getbacktome, cheers ml
