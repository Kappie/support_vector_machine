I mean, those of us who don’t like football, we’re a small, disturbed, antisocial lot and prefer enjoying our anti superbowl activities without fanfare. Me, I’ll probably have a Buffy fest or a charmed marathon whilst painting my nails. And drinking beer (duh). But absolutely no chili or hot wings (standard football viewing consumables, so I’ve been told) because, yuck. Hey, and you know those people who say, “Oh I don’t care about the game I just enjoy watching the commercials or the half time show or both.”? Yeah, I don’t even want to go into their issues. Commercials?  Good lord.  Anyway, back about a gazillion years ago, before I gave up trying to pass myself off as considerate and easy going, I agreed to attend a superbowl party. I was told there would be a movie shown for the non-football-caring humans who were coming. The movie turned out to be Jerry Maguire. Now how was I supposed to choose between the lesser of those two evils? “But doesn’t Renee Zellweger cancel out Tom Cruise?” you might be thinking. No, she does not. Throw in that melon headed creepy kid and Cuba Gooding jr. and she so cannot redeem it. There would have to be, like, 30 people that rock in a movie with Tom Cruise for it not to blow. (Ok, Legend was a good movie but Tom was nothing more than a prop really and it had the lord of darkness, fairies and he was sporting a mullet. In fact, I believe Tim Curry referred to him at one point in the movie as “that mulleted fairy “. Or, perhaps not.)  I think I ended up getting drunk and mocking every one at the party, every one in the movie and everyone at the superbowl.  In that order.   Show me the money, jeez. Show me projectile vomiting. Oh! I just remembered another lovely superbowl party incident. This happened about four years ago, before I stopped trying to pass myself off as a delight to spend time with. “Let’s go to this great superbowl party, we’ll only stay a few minutes”, and “lots of amusing people will be there” were grunted at me as I was being shoved into the car. So, now, what part of an hour and a half with a room full of non alcohol consuming, mullet sporting, diet coke-heads staring at the screen like beady eyed, slack jawed lumps witnessing the second coming constitutes “great”, “a few minutes”, and/or “lots of amusing people”? Yes,  exactly.    “I’m worth a million in prizes”-Iggy Pop   I was blasting this a teensy bit too loud and blew out one of my speakers yesterday so I thought this an appropriate quote. And also,  obviously , I am.
