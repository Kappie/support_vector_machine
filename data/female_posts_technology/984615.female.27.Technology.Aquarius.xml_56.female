I took him to the airport today, and although I am going to see him again in about a weeks time...now that he's gone I'm crying like a silly bastard. I know that we'll keep in touch, and that there is no doubt in my mind that we'll always remain friends, its just the idea that I don't get to keep something special with him that no one else had. I got to live with him. I got to be a part of the paddy-party 24/7. damn.   I just have to keep reminding myself that I'll see him in 10 days time. 10 days time. 10 days time.
