It was one of the smaller single-person models that you can use inside.  I decided to try it out one night with a workout.  It was a warm evening, and it was starting to get dark.  I had just gotten home from work, and I was in a great mood.  I was definitely ready for some jumping.  So I went to the computer and put on my "Psych Up" playlist nice and loud.  I began to dance around the apartment, threw off my shoes and started jumping away.  Waving my hands in the air, like I just didn't care, if you know what I mean.  I was having a great time but it was getting warm, so I stripped down to my bra and undies.  That was much more comfortable, and more good songs came on.  I continued to jump and sing and dance around getting a great workout.    I was spinning around in circles when I happened to glance outside.  My jaw dropped as my hand went to my mouth.  A small crowd had assembled outside on the sidewalk.  They booked it as soon as they saw me look.  And while cracking up, I ducked as soon as I recovered from my shock.  It was pretty funny.  When I slowly peeked out the window next, I saw that a couple of them had returned, waiting for the next show.  They didn't get another show that evening.  The lesson:  Remember to close the blinds before jumping on a trampoline in your underwear.
