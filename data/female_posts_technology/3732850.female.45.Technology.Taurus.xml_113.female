I'm sorry she's not appreciated, she chooses to have these feelings on the basis of her mate. I have not, and do not condone the way the author speaks in this essay because she obviously thinks she is much more than equal to a male. She has deffinatley made some bad decisions in her life if she thinks that all of the things she describes are of herown responsibility. She makes me mad to think that there are people out there that have no respect, either for themselves or their mate. I believe that a relationship is a 50/50 venture and that in itself deserves respect.
