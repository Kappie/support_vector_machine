Hurry get the bags packed, God sometimes I feel like a yak, With bag on shoulder, and baby in arm, Run out the door with no yarn.  Drop baby at sitter's, And calm the motherly jitters, Rush to class, To be an ass.  Rush home, a husband to awake,  Drop him off at work for his sake, Rush back to class, To only be last.  Get the child, Cranky and wild, Later a husband to get, And maybe I'll finally sit.  All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003
