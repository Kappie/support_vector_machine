I was stoned out of my mind because when I got home from work I ate a small pot brownie leftover from Jason's (Green Marble's bf) foray into the "medicinal" culinary arts. When XX called to ask if I was ready, I said, "Sure, just knock on my door." But in my paranoia I asked, "But how will I know that it's you?"  "I'll do 'Shave and a Haircut'." "Okay."        "No, Indian!"   "Indian?" "You know,  KNOCK -knock-knock-knock- KNOCK -knock-knock-knock."   I laughed for a long long time. I can't tell if it was really that funny or if I was just really stoned.  The Juxtapoz event was full of artful-looking people. Fashionistas and fashionistos. Hipsters, mods, rockabillies, gothics, and all sorts of stimulating eye candy. I was high on pharmaceuticals so it was fun to look at everyone and what everyone was wearing. There was a small cabin built inside the space that had some art pieces hung up inside. In general, there wasn't that much art, like paintings and drawings, to look at. The real art that night was the people that came and turned out.   Everyone looked fantastic and great to see and observe. It wasn't full of models, but just regular weirdos styled and coiffed and dressed to the 9s. It was pretty laid back too. People didn't look at each other with haughtiness or condescension, but with curiosity. I feel like a pansy for saying it this way, but the gaze that night was one of respectful awe, much like how you'd approach viewing a painting or a sculpture. Perhaps everyone was so starved to see art that instead, we turned our sights on each other.   There must still be bud in my veins.
