I hadarranged a surprise bridal party for my sister. I hired a couple of male strippers. What can I say except - HOT!! Best bling I ever spent. She had a great time and everyone at the party had a great time. I am thankful to have a sister.  Greg and I are moving forward in this "relationship". We've both been kind of slow about it but I can feel that things are picking up between us. The stress of our jobs takes its toll though. I don't know of many relationships that can endure that.   We played tennis last Sunday night. In return I promised to learn to play eq. We'll see how this goes. It's something that he enjoys and he did try to play tennis so I will try. We've got a big weekend planned. I am looking forward to it. He was out of town last week so I am enjoying having him around again...  Feels like the real thing - could it be?
