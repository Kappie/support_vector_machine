I can't help thinking that if I had watched 2 Days in the Valley before the other two, I would have enjoyed it more. But the other 2 were so much better and of course, had much more depth to them.   I love Keisha Castle-Hughes, the little girl who played Pai in Whale Rider. What a natural! For those of you who have not seen it, be advised, this is not for the special-effects lovers, nor for the fast-paced, blockbuster type movie goers. But definitely well-worth watching.  As for Monsters, Charlize Theron definitely deserved the Best Actress award she won for this role.   That said, Sunday was a day spent almost entirely in front of my Mom's PC, which suffered when their house got hit by lightning weeks ago. Connecting via their Ethernet cable, they get nada, no response from their ISP provider (They have DSL). Connecting via a USB connection, it is not as fast as they are used to. I spent hours and still couldn't get it to work optimally.  I'm so sick of that PC. And I feel bad for my mom cause she's always having all sorts of PC problems. Oh, well, we'll have another go at it...some other time.  Thanks Mom for treating us to Red Lobster and Chinese food!  It's back to work tomorrow. Yuck!
