A girl descibed as 'mousy' interviewed on Wednesday, five thought-provoking days after my follow-up email to HR about how much I want to switch into this group. Maybe I have pigeonholed myself as an admin and they will never be able to see me as an associate. This weekend I will kick job search into high gear. My fat bitch bosswill be here on Monday which will make me want to get the fuck out of hereeven more. To make matters worse I have the case of third eye - a giant zit on my forehead! Perhaps I will document it with a photo later.
