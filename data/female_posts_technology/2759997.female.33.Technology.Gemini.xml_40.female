Ignore this if you already know me or don't care to -- this is for those who have asked for a little more background on me:  Born: May 24, 1971 in Dover, DE Grew up: Delaware to Illinois ('81) to New Jersey ('84) to Indiana ('87). College:  Indiana University, Bloomington IN Currently: Nashville, Tennessee Work: IT Product Manager for national non-profit organization Married: Not presently (was previously, not against the idea in the future) Children: None that I'm aware of  ;)  Seriously - despite what you may think, it's HARD to talk about one's self...  So I'll add to this as I realize what "important" factoids of my life I've missed.   Update:  urlLink Official Blogger Profile.
