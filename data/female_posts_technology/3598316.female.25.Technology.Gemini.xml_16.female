Yesterday I went over to help out and today I can still smell the stench. The poor girl was ripping out carpet and moving everything upstairs all by herself.  What an overwhelming experience. And we had yet ANOTHER storm last night. The thunder was so loud it was setting off car alarms. I was up from 2:30 - 3:30, then again at 5 to reset my alarm when the power came back on. What a crazy night.    I discovered that KOTO has good Tuna sushi, and that eating big pieces of raw tuna actually tastes good.   June 24 moving day....anyone interested?  maybe i will just strap my stuff onto my back and drag it over. (guilt trip working ?)   great thanks
