But today he held the door for me even though I was far away. He looked at the book I was reading and said he owned it and had been meaning to read it. He asked how it was and I said voice, tone, style. Then it was over. I think I'm in love with him again. In honor of my renewed vows of crushiness, I will slack off. Or jack off.
