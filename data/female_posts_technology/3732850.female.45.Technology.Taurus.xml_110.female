The woman in the essay is sharing how she feels to have everything taken away from her. TO be put into a place where she is forced to have a roommate and when there is nothing to live for anymore. When she was counting the minutes till lunch i thinkthat it was the writers way of really making us see howlife was for her in a nursing home. I dont think that i could be happy in a home. I am a free spirited person and i dont want anyone to take that away from me. They cant.
