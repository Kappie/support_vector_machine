If all goes well, I'll have a nice supply of herbs all summer, and if all goes very well, I'll be able to harvest some tomatoes. (I'm not sure how well tomatoes will grow in containers, but it is worth a try.)  I have a few avocado pits in water that are sending up shoots. I'm hoping to get a decent avocado plant or two from them.  I've been thinking I should dig out my sprouting jar and buy some seeds. I used to grow alfalfa sprouts all the time, but got out of the habit when the jar was boxed up for an apartment move. I was reminded of it when I saw a book on sprouting a the used book store yesterday.
