Checking out some  urlLink Yahoo venues  after checking my  urlLink Yahoo ,  urlLink GMail ,  urlLink Earthlink  and  urlLink DonEasy  email earlier this morning and discovered that I can also  urlLink write Movie reviews  through there.... and, we all know, that I am loving to write so much that I am seemingly turning into a bloggerhead ... hee hee....  I (pant, pant) must t y p e my blogggggggeerrr....(zzzzzzzz)...... (even if it is 2am when normal people are sleeping!!!) just kidding....  Even so, I have made an attempt at a review on  urlLink Finding Forrester  earlier today before heading off to work.  Let me know what you think.  Would I make it as a movie critic?  Does it inspire you to aspire to see the movie????  Any suggestions for future reviews????
