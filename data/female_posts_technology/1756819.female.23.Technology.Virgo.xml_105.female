I had to clear my room for my new furniture :)  I got a new bed, dresser, night stand delivered on Saturday morning.  So now after 4 years of sleeping on a mattress on the floor, I finally have a real bed!    Saturday, after the guys arranged my furniture I headed south to Mike and Sandi's for the day.  We went out in the boat, swam for awhile then had a fish fry and fireworks.  It rained for a bit, but otherwise the weather was great.    Sunday, bummed around at home.  Didn't feel like going out in the rain to watch more fireworks, so stayed home and watched Independance Day, and Cold Mountain.    Monday, went down to Chicago, ate an excellent lunch at  urlLink Big Bowl , walked around, shopped, had some good coffee at  urlLink Moonstruck , went to the Sears tower, zero visibility, stayed on the ground, wandered around Chinatown, came back to GR.
