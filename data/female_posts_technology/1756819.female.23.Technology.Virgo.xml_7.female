Last night I went to Best Buy and bought myself a digital camera to replace my old one.  Unfortunately they did not have the camera I wanted in stock, so I have to wait for it to be delivered to my house.  I got the  urlLink Canon SD100 .  Since my old camera was broken, I haven't taken any pictures in a while, so it will be great to have a camera again :). -- And a pet update...my sister's cat just had kittens...again.  Five little balls of fluff.
