The people I know who did actually has the last name of Friend, so it makes it even more interesting.  I used to watch this show religiously, and have fallen out in the last few years.  I can't remember the last time I saw an episode the actual first time it aired.  That said, I really want to see the final show.  If you taped it (hint, Trip) please let me know.    The reason I fell out of the whole FRIENDS routine is that it's too long of a commitment to keep up with a show for ten years.  An entire season of a regular show is tough.  I've turned to  urlLink The Bachelor  to solve my TV dilemma.  With only six or seven episodes per season, it's perfect for someone like me with a short attention span.  I am absolutely addicted to this show.  I either watch an entire season or none at all.  Wayne is a sweetheart and actually tapes my show for me while I'm in class, then I watch it when I get to his place afterward.  This Wednesday there was a tradeoff and I had to watch Star Trek Enterprise to get him to watch it with me, but it was worth it.    This show, the Bachelor kicked off the witch that everyone has hated from the first episode, and the one that is probably thrilling the producers and bringing them ratings.  She is a complete nightmare.  At the end of the episode, she promises that "This isn't over" and they show clips from the next episode her stalking him on his dates with the other girls.  I don't get the compulsion to embarrass oneself in front of the whole viewing audience like that.  Reality TV, in that way, is made up of a bunch of wackos.  Still, I won't pretend I'm not entertained.
