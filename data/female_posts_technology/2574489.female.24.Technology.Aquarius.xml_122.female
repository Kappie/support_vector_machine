I'm also looking forward to this:    Kill BIll Vol. 2!  The DVD for Vol. 1 is already out, but I'm gonna hold off until they come out with the boxed set.  Oh and a little tidbit: Quentin Tarantino is coming out with a Vol. 3...of Vernita Green's daughter in Vol. 1 seeking revenge for her mother's death. Ain't it cool?  But apparently it won't be for quite a while...he said about 10 yrs. Oh my, I'll be in my 30s by then. (For those wondering why I don't just get the pirated DVDs of both, I say I HATE pirated DVDs. Their quality is always poor and they never have any of the exclusive contents the authentic DVDs have.)   Another tidbit, Tarantino is going to be a judge in American Idol sometime soon. Probably this week's show. I'm gonna make sure I watch it!  Downtown where I work is also holding the Main Street Arts Festival this weekend and we're going to that too. Last year when we went was a blast.  That's one thing I love about where I work. I go out the front door of our building and walk into all sorts of events held throughout the year. I'll make sure to take lots of pics so you can all be a part of the experience.
