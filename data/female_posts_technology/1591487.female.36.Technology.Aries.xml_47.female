A weekend spent in the nation's capital was delightful, catching up with friends was fantastic, eating three blocks of Lindt chocolate and one block of Green and Blacks organic chocolate was not.  Well, it was fantastic in the delicious sense, but not so fantastic in the glutton sense.  I think I might have to come up with the supermarket tour of the world, I can't tell you how much I love wandering about supermarkets in foreign lands, to me they epitomise the local culture.  Where else would you find what makes a community tick but by what they buy to eat?  Canberra residents clearly like good quality chocolate, well the particular area I was staying in anyway.  The Lindt section was extensive, so of course,  I bought a selection of the Lindt under the guise of giving them as gifts to those back home.  Sorry kids, no gifts, I ate the gifts.  They were delicious.
