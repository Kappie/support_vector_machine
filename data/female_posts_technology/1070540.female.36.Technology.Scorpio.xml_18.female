Sad thing is...I didnt feel like he wanted me.  this has really made me upset.  He laid next to me and masterbated....I normally do not care.  But this nite...I really wanted him.  I get up early so I laid down knowing he needed to have some unwind time.  Then he didnt really go to sleep until it was time for me to get up.  I am not really taking this personally..But it does hurt my feelings...I want my hubby to lay next to me and hold me all night.  Guess I am selfish for that.  But I dont like this feeling that he does not want me.  It really makes me feel awful.  I have been feeling bad since gaining some weight. (but I am working on that)....But I know he still loves me...I just want him to desire me.
