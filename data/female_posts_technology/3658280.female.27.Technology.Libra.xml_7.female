I'm sure I could come up with little mind-numbing piddly busy-work kinds of things to do, like alphabetizing our software or re-coiling extra network cables, but I can only do things like that for so long. I've been deleting old email addresses from our client web site. Look up the client, see if their active, if not, deactivate them on the web. Whee.  I could be doing so many things at home. The garage is so unorganized now it makes me cringe each time I walk in there. I could shampoo the carpet, even though the dog's leaking situation still isn't fully under control. (I adjusted her medication yesterday, I have to give it about a week). Speaking of the dog, I could give her a bath. I could be cooking a fabulous meal for my live-in to enjoy when he gets home from work. (ok, that's a stretch - but I could at least try). I could start filling my scrap book that I bought at least a month ago. Live-in likes the grass all nice and neat, I could mow that.   These are the things I would do if I didn't have to sit here on my ass all day long, bored out of my skull. Worst part is, unless one of the technologically challenged individuals here downloads a virus or installs a hotbar for me to remove, I won't have anything to do until Tuesday, when my boss returns with more not-so-exciting projects for me to put off until the next time he goes on vacation.  I know. I should find another job. I thought that for a while. But then I remembered how I just LOVED my last job when I started there, and how OH MY GOSH I could work here forever, and I just LOVE my boss and blah, blah, blah. Nope. Changing jobs won't help. You know why I took this job? Because I could wear jeans. Yep. That's what sold me at the interview, that's why I took such a pay cut to come here. Jeans. How cool to work in an office and be able to wear JEANS every day! Now I don't really care. So I know if I leave here, in 3 more years (seems to be my limit), I will be bored and ready to move on. Might as well stay bored here than take another pay cut.  I can't help it. I am not career oriented. I work because I have to. People will say, "Oh, but you'd be so BORED if you didn't work." Bullshit. I would find things to do. I would start by doing all the things I don't do now. Because now, by the time I get home from work, I don't feel like it. All the things I think about on my way to work that sound like such a good idea at the time, but take too much of my precious time by the time I finally get home that I don't want to waste time on them.   Does that make any freaking sense at all????  I don't want to waste time doing things I want to do because I don't have a lot of time to do them? So I sit my ass on the couch, watch TV, have sex if I'm lucky, fall asleep, and start all over again the next day.  At least I'm getting sex....
