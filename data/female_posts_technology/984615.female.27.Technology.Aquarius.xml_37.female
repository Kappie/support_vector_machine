You'll just have to scroll down through them if you want to see the results... They were from a recent trip I took for New Years to Vegas with my chicas.....the only one that is really worth any time to look at is the "finale"  Otherwise if you want more your're going to need to  urlLink e-mail me ....and if you show me yours I'll show you mine.... ::wink, wink::
