Dunno why I'm so happy...slept well I guess, and the pressure is off (sort of) at work.  Oh, and I have a short week this week, that could have some bearing on my mood.  I'm taking Thursday and Friday off this week so my roomie and I can drive to Ontario to visit my folks, and take care of some business in TO.  So, three days and I'm off on a four day weekend, woo hoo!  So I'm happy, all is right with the world.  Yesterday was fun.  Went to church in the morning, and was actually on time for a change.  Went to lunch at the Olive Garden with DC and Guam.  Took a nap (gotta love Sunday afternoon naps).  Saw Luther with Guam and Vbijl.  Good movie, I enjoyed it.  The theatre was surprisingly packed...a couple of church groups I think.  After the movie went with Vbijl to  Kathy (sp?)  Cathy and Pat's for dinner, then went to Billy's to hear the  urlLink Red Elvises .  I don't normally go out on Sunday nights, but this group was well worth it.  Not sure how I would describe their music style, but it's fun.  When you first see the group come out on stage, you know its gonna be a blast.  One guy was wearing a gold suit, another a red sparkley suit with 3" platforms and a top hat, another a animal print suit that looked sorta like pjs.  The instruments were great too, I loved the accordian, and one guy was playing a guitar that was a huge triangle.  Their songs were all sorta wacky and joking around, and you could tell that they were enjoying themselves too.  The music was right up my alley :)  The only downside is that you come home smelling like stale smoke, but *shrugs* what can you do...you can't win em all.
