Inday Badiday's  Dolphy interview is in the background here inside the rentals.  I called my Dad before going to mass this morning. Told him that I love him and miss him. I also asked him if he's really going home next year, but he said that he is still working on his papers and that it's hard to go out and come back in the US right now because of the  911  incident.  Kasama sya sa wish ko.  I guess hindi ko na ie-expect na matupad sya this March pero malay natin.  A woman answered the phone when I called his apartment.  I wonder who she is...  Pagdumating dito sa Daddy, date kami.  May mga itatanong at sasabihin ako sa kanya.  Ikukwento ko sa kanya ang taong unti-unting minamahal ko.   Miss na kita, Dad.
