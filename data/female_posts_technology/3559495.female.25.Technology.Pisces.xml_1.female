I'm glad now that I didn't go.   I'm disappointed, yes but I couldn't date a married man.  It's wrong.  If I were married and my husband were dating other women, I would be devastated.  This is a downer.  He has such strong magnetism.  It's that smile.  He's very attractive.  I was and am very attracted.  That removes one person from my thoughts.  Now there's just the guy at work.  I know for a fact that he's single.  So this is where I have to stop thinking about him.  Him the exciting one with the fabulous smile.  Stop.
