The bulk of the video (shot right down the street from the  Chunksaah Records office) was done on the Asbury Park boardwalk just north of Convention Hall. You can check out some behind the scenes photos at the Chunksaah Archive Gallery.  Also, former Sticks  Stones and Zero Zero guitarist and one time Bouncing Souls collaborator  Mike Cavallaro (a.k.a. Johnny X)  has turned his attention to his other love: comics. Here's an update from Johnny X:  This weekend, June 26th and 27th is New York City's annual MOCCA cartoon art convention, and I'll be there at my table, with both issues of "66 Thousand Miles Per Hour" and some freebies I've made, tucked away in some dark corner of the Puck Building on the corner of Houston and Lafayette streets. There is so much great art and cool things going on every year at this thing, don't miss it if you're in the area. See you there, Johnny X  Via  www.punknews.org
