'Easy as pie' is another one, have you ever made a pie? It takes frickin' ages and is not easy, especially making the pastry, it's difficult, it's tricky and time consuming. 'Easy as pie' - my arse.  'A walk in the park' - what's that about? A walk in the park can be quite arduous, especially if there's creatures around, like spiders and flies, and especially if it's hot.    Conceptually incorrect cliches are very annoying.  Although, really, I'm probably the only person I know who uses them. More fool me, eh?  I don't know if I've made a dumb decision.    I withdrew from a job application that I had probably a pretty good chance of getting. It was the travel thing, not the fact that it was a longer than normal journey to and from home (which was also a factor), but the notion of travelling round the state and possibly, country, made me think about the impact it would have on my life.    I just wasn't prepared to do it.  I think it would have been different if I had been younger and more gung-ho about these things, but I'm just not anymore.  I've come to the realisation that in my dotage my aim for calm and serenity has resulted in me searching for stability rather than chaos and whatever notion constitutes 'excitement'.    The things I find exciting are much smaller now, I think.  While I absolutely love the concept of travel, I'd rather do it on my own terms - for enjoyment,  and for me it's always been about the journey, if I had to work at the end of it, I'd just be focussing on that and not on what's happening on the way there.   I've never had any delusions about travelling for work, I've seen it around me with colleagues and it seems the gloss fades very quickly.  So that's it, really.  I made a decision and have to stick with it now.  God forbid, I should decide to make a stinkin' pie.
