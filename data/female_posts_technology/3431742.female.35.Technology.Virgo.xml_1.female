I didn't push the issue since I was fine about having a warm apt almost all year round.  Warm good.  COLD bad, very bad.   It only sucked when it was REALLY warm.  The room with the wall airconditioner was cool but the bedroom would be warmer than toast.  Some nights that was hell but w/o covers it's not too bad.  So any, it should be installed this weekend or next week sometime.  Had fun making a cheese cake last night.  It baked pretty well.  New recipe that i've been wanting to try.  Tried it this morning.  WAY chocolatey sweet.  Awesome for those chocolate chravings.  Helped out a friend this morning.  Never knew ripping up carpeting would help in getting out so much agression.  Thanks buddy.  Anytime you need help again I'm more than willing.  OK now about the class w/ no license.  I was under the terrible impression that after taking this class I would be a licensed bartender.  Nope.  Now it looks like I have to go to the city and pay 45 bucks to get the damn thing.  I thought paying the 25 bucks for class meant that I get the license after or something close to that. I suppose I was having a major blonde moment when Jen told me the other part of the deal but I so don't remember hearing the other part.  The really hard part is finding the time to get downtown or whereever I have to go to get the damn thing.  I mean the fees paid out isn't a biggy since those can be made up with one night of working.  I guess another mental health day is needed. hehe  Few major fun things coming up.   urlLink Summerfest   Going at least 3 or 4 times.  25th to see  urlLink Rufus Wainwright    urlLink Joan Jett  on the 28th.  4th has  urlLink Indigo Girls .  29th  urlLink Kenny Wayne Shepherd .

Other fun events:   urlLink Dining out  night - June 10th.  Heading out with Jen, best friend from High School and her hubby, and a mutual friend of us all.  We just haven't picked a place yet.  Well after a full day of events I was really beat.  Took a great nap and woke back up around 830.  Damn cell phone.  Did anyone ever say that power tools were a great reviving tool?  I just did! :)  The question for the posting is this:  Did you ever leave a gathering cause the conversation weirded you out?
