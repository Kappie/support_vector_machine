I saw someone's blog on the internet and it was surprisingly interesting even if they're not a celebrity or anything.  Weird, ha! No history, just plunge right into what I'm doing:  I'm sitting at work, getting paid for doing nothing! Hah  It's the 29th of December and people are still on vacation, we're not getting any psychologists or technicians or students or teachers to call us with their problems.  I'm Tech Support for a software company.  Anyway, we had a five day weekend and then no calls at work...kinda nice....but-- we (as in my husband and I) have a lot of work to do at home.  We just moved to a new apartment. And man, it took three f$$$ing days to get 90% done. I didn't mind the packing, its the moving and unpacking that bothered me.  So, I offered to set up our bedroom and bathroom and lingered there until he had finished the living room (the boxes in the living room overwhelmed me--seriously, we had a fort going on there). and by setting up the bedroom I don't mean putting together our bed. I mean, I put sheets on the bed, put up our clothes in the closet, put toilet paper roll on the bathroom toilet paper holder thingamagig.  And I think we blew our budget for this month on eating out...hey! you try finding time to cook on moving day...it's impossible!  We still have to clean out the old apartment or we'll get charged up our butts...you better believe I'll make like a Mister Clean and get that place spotless....La na akong pera (I have no more money)!
