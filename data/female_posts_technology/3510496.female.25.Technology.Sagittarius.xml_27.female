The L-room has been practically the most 'comfort' zone for us to do almost anything around there (excl. bathroom and kitchen activities) e.g. ironing, reading.  Just last night *almost every night* we had dinner *plus other meals* in the L-room, in-front of the TV. Poor dining table abandon. It's pretty routine every night. If I cook dinner, we shall have early dinner, in the L-room in front of TV, clean-up, shower than perform our maghrib and isyak. Otherwise, if not cooking (e.g. ta-pao, complimentary from mama/mil), we will have late dinner after isyak, but still in the L-room in-front of TV.    urlLink    Is this healthy? *shrugs*  urlLink    I hope things will be different by the time our day-bed (mama calls it kerusi ambin) and coffee table comes in.
