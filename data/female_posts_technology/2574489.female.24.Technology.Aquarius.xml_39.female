I came home tonite after having done the groceries and was putting away food in the fridge when I saw our clear plastic jug filled with white stuff.  I'm thinking, curdled milk, coconut milk, what is that white stuff?    It was leftover rice.  He stored our leftover rice in a clear plastic jug.  I wrote on our eraser board:  please don't put our rice in clear plastic jug again, because...well, its just weird!   2. Husband, as mentioned above, is a great sneezer.  And not just when I've gotten him sick.  Once, back when we were in college, he regaled me with tales of his allergy attack in class.  He started sneezing and the whole class counted each sneeze...he sneezed once, twice, three times....by this time the whole class was amused....four times, five, six....the class started getting excited --will it break a record?---seven, eight, nine....the class started counting out loud as a group....ten, evelen....sixteen sneezes!    The class went wild, they hailed him a hero, a god! They carried him on their shoulders, out the classroom door, out the school building singing "for he's a jolly good fellow".    Okay, maybe the last part never happened.  3. Husband will insist we do not clean up after ourselves when we eat in fast food restaurants.  He believes if we clean up after ourselves it will steal jobs away from the low-paid workers who work in such restaurants.  We have to do what we can to make them indispensable, he insists.  This fact obliges me to make sure I carry all our after-eating trash to the trash bin myself.  4.  Husband always insists we are broke.  Even when we have money.  When I try to tell him how much money we actually have he'll stop me.  He wants to always think we're broke.  He doesn't want to feel like he can spend whatever we want because we have money in the bank....okay maybe this is actually a good idea.  5. Husband wears underwear for multiple days until I threaten to take a match to said underwear, then he changes it.    Odd husband, loving husband, lovable husband. =) -
