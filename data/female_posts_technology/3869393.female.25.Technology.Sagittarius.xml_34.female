Today, after many days of controlling myself, I decided its' time to take courage and visit his blog and actually find out if he is posting stuff, or just reserving stuff for his "better" half! Well, I was pleasantly surprised to see that he was actually pouring his heart out into a blog, just like me.   Quite a funny thing happend then, I was actually planning to write a blog today on astrology and draw instances from predications made by astrologers, his and mine, and I found a blog on the same topic in his. Haha...I guess we always have been jinxed when it came to the thought process.  As I was going thro' the blog, there were a few thoughts which came to my mind, and thought hey, okay lets post some comments, but what do I see, his comments option aint working...hmm..so much for the best software solutions!   Anyway, so I thought okay, maybe its' done on purpose, anyway, which ever the case is, I thought I'd post my comments on this page itself, since most of it pertain to me....hahaha...the ghost of chennai! ;)  1. Pain has a beauty about it, it comes when you least want it, and when you cant take it the most! Its' when one survives thro' this pain that they become a greater human being! There seriously aint any fun in shying again from this pain!  2. Astrology:  Haha..this probably is the biggest irony. A few days ago I had a little bit of any insight into this first hand, and really one cant say if it works or not. Btw, his astrologer said that if he got married, it would be of his choice, yeah..obviously this can also be interpretated as, even if an arranged marriage it's really the girl and the guy who have the final say! Jokes apart, astrology has its own way of governing our lives, as much as we hate to believe it, some stuff comes true, some wrecks our lives, some bring us sweet memories, etc.   3. Me, the wrecker: This probably is the best compliment I have got for days about myself. Well, for whatever I did do to contribute towards messing things up, I have taken responsibility for that, but there is little or not reason which I see where others have taken responsibility and shown magnanimity to accepting the same. Each of my blogs have been steps which I have taken towards punishing myself for whatever mistakes I may have commited. I know myself, I have been true to myself always and forever!  4. Forgetting stuff....hahaha..this is probably the icing on the cake. I was planning to write a blog on friday on how ppl, especially guys seem to be able to walk away from relationships without having any feelings towards what has been lost. Infact, if I remember right, that was the day I spoke to a few of our common friends and discussed this issue. Quite surprising ...but yet another misconception! Anyway, one thing which is clear for me is that....my memories are ones which I will always cherish, its' god given stuff...I had some of the best times in my life....sweet memories can never be forgotten or ever erased!  5. Misconceptions: So much for thinking that the other person was out of it!!!! Hahahaha...nice joke....memories cant even fade away too easily....its a very tough job..and more than anything one needs something must more herculean to be able to battle past one's memories!   6. Second phase of life...Arranged marriage...hmm...commitment, oops...words a normal sagitarrian will shudder to even mention...but then as a human being, one has to say the words one day!  7. Big yet small world...we all live in a big world..and yet it is small coz everyone finds a way of relating to each other..and more than anything....time has it's own way of bringing ppl to terms with it's twisted sense of humour! Paths will cross, destiny's path is something which is decided, its more a matter of choosing to walk on the road or on the footpath!
