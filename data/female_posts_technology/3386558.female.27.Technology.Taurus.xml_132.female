March 10, 2001       I've written so many things in so many other voices that sometimes i forget that i am a person, too. a person with genuine feelings and a sex drive the size of the state of texas. for so long, i've been this girl or that for whichever piece i've been working on that i've managed to overlook the fact that i'm a girl, too. that i'm not a character, not a "she", but me. living, breathing, fucking lil' ole me. "so what do you want?" you may ask. you know, it's been so long since i've been asked that that i've forgotten the answer.          July 26, 2001       So i have pointed out to myself that i'm getting no where fast. years have swept by, and i find myself standing still. well, tomorrow is going to be a better day. a more beautiful and vibrant day. a cleaning day, a cleansing day. a day to wipe away all the years of accumulated dust and find the beauty, shining beneath. and why? why? what's so special about tomorrow? why, it follows today, and "today is the day we break free," according to Poe. that's singer, not literary genius. i know i've said it before, but i'm hoping to never say it again... today is the day i say goodbye to old ghosts.          July 27, 2001       took the pictures down yesterday. took them out of the album as well. put them in a box with the paper roses. even took the drawing down off the wall. unbelievable feeling after. the tension left my shoulders, my chest. have been talking about getting rid of these things for years now, but never once even reached for them to put them away. extemely pleased with myself. spoke with jessica yesterday and admitted i was ready to leave it all behind. don't want to see or speak to him anymore, don't want to speak ABOUT him anymore, for self-preservation. taking down the pictures...THAT pleased her. said i sounded healthy. ME = HEALTHY? is that possible? i'm wondering if there is going to be pain. There was some that night, but it was so tolerable that i fell asleep. me, the insomniac, who can't sleep because she's always thinking and worrying about something, was so upset i just passed out? that doesn't fit me, as much as healthy does not suit me. but maybe things are changing again. maybe my body is starting to age and is tired of the boy/girl games and my mind has decided to follow along. one can only hope. whole hours have gone by that i haven't thought about him. joyous. not to say he doesn't invade my mind at times. obviously. he is now - i'm writing about him. i realize it may be a somewhat painful and tedious project - weeding him out of me.          July 28, 2001       just had a drink by myself at a bar for the first time (i was looking for my sister, but alas, she was not there). very uneventful. watched old couples, new couples, people hooking up and felt extremely small and meaningless. realize how much i miss having someone next to me, their arm circling my waist, whispering vulgarities into my ear. sometimes it's painful to see two people close and happy together, and i secretly wish them unwell. yes, it's selfish and a bit adolescent of me, and the phrase "misery loves company" i guess pretty much coins me. it's sad, walking through life thinking you need someone to share it with you in order to be happy. that idea doesn't appeal to me, but the fact that it's always thrown in my face leads me to believe that i NEED it.           July 31, 2001       so there were two ways this could have gone: we could have had the "pissed off, leave me alone" ending, or the "i'm so happy...i've been trying to make this happen" ending. i'm vying for the latter, but alas, it looks like plan A is in the lead. Here's the situation. Harry and I hooked up sunday night, (and monday morning, and monday aftertoon), and we had hours of glorious fun, on both parts. the problem: who wanted to tell kim. we were both worried about how she would react to this little freak occurence, so we chickened out of the direct approach and just had harry answer my phone when she called monday afternoon. he said she had no reaction, but she also decided she didn't want to speak with me. i went to go see her after i dropped him off and she was distant. i finally asked her point-blank how she felt about it all, if she was cool about me and harry. she says, "what about you and harry?" she was making it difficult; whether on purpose or not, it was painful spelling it out for her. she just shrugged it off, but she's been distant and i'd say almost cold since. i thought maybe she would think it's cool, but that's not the vibe i'm getting from here right now. i have no idea what to do at this point. (to read what kim actually was thinking at that time, go to   urlLink  kim-land-ton-ville    and read the entry called "dexter and greta" dated july 29, 2004)          August 3, 2004       finally talked to kim. everything seems fine now. chris was right; she just needed a few days. she actually sounded happy to hear from me, which is cool. we talked for a while about the concert tomorrow and upcoming concerts we may want to go to when jess comes home. maybe she'll want to come to the savin rock festival on sunday with me and harry as well.      Genius called me drunk last night, talking incoherently. said he'd call back in an hour so i could decide if he was ok to drive, so i stayed up till 1am, and, of course, he never called. sometimes i wonder why i care so much. sometimes i wonder if he calls just to make me worry. i don't think i'll ever fully understand him.      Talked to harry a couple of times yesterday. it's cool to talk to someone new, but i get the feeling that he may be too good for me. he genuinely cares about people, his friends, especially. he tried to take care of everyone. i just can't be that selfless. i feel like i'm too prissy for him. i hate being like that.           August 6, 2001       the dave concert was cool. kim and i had a pretty good time, minus her getting nauseous because of the crowd. met up with harry after; we had some fun. on sunday, we all went to the savin rock festival on west haven beach. me, harry, kim, kaylee, casey, mike, haileigh, and kalen. the kids had a great time, so did the adults. casey thinks harry and i should hook up; kim almost busted a gut laughing about that one. she seems pretty cool with everything now. she's just going through a think right now. she just wants to be happy. i don't think that's too much to ask.
