I am positive my neighbors think I'm nuts.  This morning, Peach called and invited me over for coffee, and when I told her I was still in my PJs and she said it was no big deal, I put on a pair of sandals and left.  Getting home at noon still in my PJs probably didn't raise my credibility with the neighbors.  Not to mention I was carrying half of Peach's wardrobe (when I mentioned I had no idea what I was going to pack, we raided her closet and solved that problem).  The couples' shower for my brother and his better half went well.  My contributions to the buffet went over more than really well.  I've often thought maybe I should take food that no one likes to these things, so I'm not asked to bring stuff in the future, but we all know I'd never stand for that...  Got to catch up with Cutter, my bro's best friend since adolescence.  I was telling Peach earlier that it's hard to believe that I can have an adult conversation with the guy that used to torment me, but I did.  When the shower was winding down, Cutter asked where we could go and have a beer and hang out, so I took him to E.  Of course, all of the regulars (at least the ones I would want to see) were either still at the shower or home, but we had a nice chat.  I guess I didn't figure that even though he was my brother's annoying friend all those years, he has known me over half my life and knows me better than most.  So the two of us solved all the world's problems over a few pints and called it a night.  Heading to San Francisco for my conference I missed a month and a half ago - and looking forward to some time away.  Although, I guess I better get upstairs and get in the shower and pack, unless I want to spend the entire week in my PJs.
