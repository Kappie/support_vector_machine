I have no reason why…I’d like to blame it on the non-existent quarter life crisis…I’m going through a clean up phase…I do it every so often ..it requires a lot of thinking and harsh actions on my part… but I think it’s healthy…It’s where I try to remove myself from all the negative people in my life… for example, you were introduced to someone by a friend and then u became friends with that person cuz hey it so easy to make friends these days..but let's now say your new friends only uses u .. as perhaps a time pass, because you have a car, or maybe cuz of your ability to do their homework, and the list can go on and on..all my life I’d had these people randomly enter my life and in turn I’d be blinded by their presence and motive ..these are the people that end up hurting your feelings in the end run ….over something extremely stupid.. they're beyond piety and cruel.. and I certainly don’t need them in my life.. so I stop talking to them .. I know that’s shady of me ..but seriously my parents didn’t create me to have some 3rd world retard use me like the last sheet of toilet tissue…I’m better then that…anyways…went to see hum tum last night…it was a cute movie and the sub titles were decent…I had a good time…however I was a bit disappointed with that saif boy…he seemed to be having a bad hair day through out the movie…oh well plus that rani chick did a great job…over all I’d give it 3 out of 5 stars… went to the gym later ..i missed my training appointment so I rescheduled for Saturday ..ended up sitting and sweating my *ss off in the steam room.. I felt so clean and relaxed when I left….for dinner  mom and dad had the nerve to order pizza not just any pizza but FAMOUS PIZZA..i mean they know I’m tryin to stay away from that stuff like that ..anyways I bought home some veggie soft toco’s it tasted like crap…I went to bed pretty early last night... I was quite amazed .. and I actually slept well probably cuz I exhausted myself …Well as for today it’s 8:29am..and I misplaced  my swipe card again ..so the people at my sister company had to open the door for me .. I have to find that bloody sucker..i know I usually put it in my back pocket of my jeans … lets c if it turns up… I’m such a dodo… I feel a bit sick today… my throat has been bothering me since I got up… it feels heavy and scratchy.. I already took one of those super strong cough drops and it not helping…I refuse to go to a doctor…I hate those guy..they never have anything good to say… oh well… I have this weird feeling that my younger sister (age 13) skipped school today…I mean check this out..her bus leaves at 8:00 and she was still in her PJ’s at 7:45 ..she hadn’t even showered ..FYI: my sister takes 45 min showers..I managed to get out a scarastic "get dressed u gonna miss the bus" ... and she replied like back like a total blonde "like nah I totally showered at night, i'm so gonna change my clothes and jet on outta here...DUH!!STUPID!!" Is it me or was her damn bus goin to pick her up in 15 min… I don’t know …that girl is way to weird for me… cuz I swear yesterday she told me talking a shower at night is so beyond totally gross…great my lil sister has turned into a hypocrite …hopefully she went to school..and I’m just over reacting… Had a very interesting convo with daddy dearest last night…he asked me if I was considering goin to Indian to find a hubby..i laughed and told him what do u think..i thought that would get me out of the discussion and I can leave his presence ..but it didn’t work this time..he shot back “it not what I think it what u think that matters”..i knew this was goin to be a long *ss convo..i decided to make myself comfortable on the couch…I told him that I don’t think India would be a logical choice for me..i’m a weird type of ABCD..don’t get me wrong I’m American and was Borned in the states and I’m hella Confused …and yah I’m Desi…but I have a fobby part to me too…I luv garba..and bhel puri…and steaming hot somosas..i don’t eat meat…I’m don’t have a personal issue with god..i don’t mind goin to the mandir…however, I refuse to go to Sunday school…I’m a weird one I know..lets see.. I left the whole "find me a guy thing" up my parents and friends I refuse to dress skanky and go to clubs and bars hoping to get a permanent man in my life..with that approach one will only get a hangover, smelly cigarette hair and a one night stand…I think that whole approach is cheap and sleazy and I refuse… I’d luv to meet someone in the mandir, or a library, park perhaps, I’ll can even do a coffee shop… I could be reading the devil wears prada..and he could be reading the latest john grishim novel.  Wow what an amazing scenario…not ever goin to happen but it was a nice thought…all over a cup of low fat tazo chai latte hold the foam easy on the cream with a dash of cinnamon.  Yup nice… oh well .. got to get back to my tea…talk to yah all tomorrow…SMOOCHIES…   Question Of The Day:  Which drink do you prefer? Sex on the Beach or Flaming Organism  I’d prefer Sex on the Beach…Flaming Organism is a bit too HOT!!! for me…Naughty Naughty…lol
