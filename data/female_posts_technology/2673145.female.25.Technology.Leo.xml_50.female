I think they are both great! :) I totally dig spidey's great body.. awwww.. =P~  The plot for Spidey 2 is better, graphics is also more natural, and the special effects are awesome. (I hope I didn't over rate it.) The only thing is, there are so many screaming females! I can picture the comic book with a square of cartoon dedicated to a screaming lady on the street. There are like almost 4 or 5 of them in this movie. A few corny scenes but I just brush it off with "comics" effect. There's a particular scene when Mary Jane was being lowered down to safety and her dress with a super high slit was taped down so that the wind won't blow off her skirt to reveal too much. Pity. Hahha..  And I don't understand why the gal sitting next to me keep giggling at everything! When they kiss, when the mean guy said something, when spidey puts on the mask, this and that. Siao ah! It's not a comedy show you know, even thou it's a adaptation of a comic.. 8-| Gals..
