Apparently, I offended my colleague, Leon, (yes, the same Leon from  urlLink my airport story ) with my comments (or ignorance) on Communism in China and whether or not religion can be practiced there.  While the contents of the argument merit a post of their own - as it certainly is an interesting subject that I know way too little of - I feel compelled to write about  how   the discussion was held and how it deteriorated (as opposed to  what  the discussion was about).   The discussion began by Leon's mentioning of a certain fact, which I then questioned. My questioning the facts were not an attempt to disqualify what Leon was saying or to judge him in any way - but rather as an honest expression of wonder at the fact itself. In my mind, this was said (or meant to be said) in astonishment, or in marvel - as that fact negated what I had heard (or thought I heard) before.   And Leon was offended. As a result, he snapped back at me, angry that I doubted his knowledge in the matter (which is undoubtedly more than mine as he himself has been in China and is married to a Chinese girl, while I know nothing of this matter), and the discussion that ensued was strained, to put it mildly.   I am not worried about where this leaves Leon and I - eventually, I made my intentions clear and we got back on track. But this incident has left me with some troubling thoughts: How is it possible, that in some cultures (Israel, Venezuela) people think of me as a most tactful person, so diplomatic - in fact - that I am always brought in to arbitrate arguments or represent matters objectively, while others (USA) I always seem to get into trouble for being tactless without the slightest intention?   Is it my choice of words? My tone? Is it my body language?   I understand that a sentence such as "Oh really?" can be interpreted in many ways - depending on context and tone. It can be casting a doubt on the legitimacy of something, it can be wonder and and awe, etc.. Could it be that the same exact tone means one thing to Americans and another to Israelis or Venezuelans?
