Basically, hubby believes that I can lose more weight if I do resistance training as opposed to doing more cardio-burning activities.  After my umpteenth (I love this word) complain about my weight he turned to me seriously. We were in my car, having just parked in my parent's driveway, and he was about to rush into the house to pee, but he held it for this momentous occasion.    He said he swears to me that if I did what he told me to do in terms of how to work out, I would lose weight so much faster. After seeing my skeptical look, he made the statement more attractive.  He bribed me with another Coach purse if I do what he wants me to do for 2 mos.  Basically, work out four times a week of 1 hour resistance training. I can do cardio if I want but it's not important, and it shouldn't cut into my resistance training.    I said...hell yeah!  The new plan starts as soon as he writes up the sets of exercises he wants me to do.  I get my purse at the end of the 2 mos. after starting.  He will monitor me through, well, nothing.  Since he can't work out with me (he's not a member of the gym and he has no interest in signing up because we have a free gym at the apartment), we will do an honor system he shall trust me to be honorable in sticking to the terms of our agreement.....I don't think there's any way I can lose, eh?   ***  On another note, concert at 7 pm tonight (after a pesky hospital visit for x-rays)! Oh yea! Unbelievable but this is my  first concert ever .  I am so excited.  Note to self: do not forget camera
