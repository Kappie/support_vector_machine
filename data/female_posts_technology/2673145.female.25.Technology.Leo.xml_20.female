It was a simple lunch at the Seah Im Food Centre - the hawker next to the WTC bus interchange. The area is now better known as Harbourfront. Joanna and I arrived 15 minutes late because of some slight delay in my office. Remy and Rachel were waiting patiently at the bus interchange when we reached. After a brief exchange of casual handshakes, we proceeded to look for an empty table. Rachel being the resourceful one found one within 5 minutes. Its no mean feat considering the hawker was full of hungry patrons hunting for empty seats.  Without further ado, we consolidated our orders for lunch. Once again it was helpful Rachel who 'volunteered' to buy Nasi Ayam for Remy and myself. She returned with three interesting versions of Nasi Ayam, namely Black Pepper, Sambal and Rendang styles. Remy had the sambal while Rachel opted for the rendang. I chose the Black pepper one which was so-so in taste. Jo happily helped herself to a plate of spinach noodles which were green in colour. After food, we chit-chatted over teh terik. It was quite a relaxing moment catching up over a glass of hot tea on a rainy afternoon. Unfortunately our reunion was short-lived. We parted ways shortly after the rain stopped. I can't help but look forward to the next meet up session. :)
