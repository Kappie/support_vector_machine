For now, I have just grabbed one of the Blogger templates and I'm satisfied with it.    Part of the minor changes I have made to the code is adding a contact link.  I have already taken heat over the grilled cheese comment (Anna, I did not mean to offend the grilled cheese enthusiasts), so the email address should provide people with some recourse to air their grievances or make suggestions.    I'm happy to report that a link to my blog has been added to my friend  urlLink Kelly 's links section on his.  Kelly has readers he's never met who tune in often enough to find out what he's thinking.  Go read it - his stuff if more interesting than mine - but don't forget to come back.
