I still have some work to do to prepare for this class, and I have a feeling I'm going to get snowballed. I've also stopped seeing my atlas orthogonal chiropractor for months now and my back has gone back to being a little messed up. That's because I've noticed if you mix too many modalities - chiropractic, craniosacral, rolfing, etc. you often don't know which modalities benefit you the most, and sometimes they clash with each other! Especially when you have one person trying to address a problem from one angle and another addresses the same or different problem from a different angle. Also, I've found two very good craniosacral practitioners in the Tampa area but they use two slightly different flavors. The one therapist who is the reason for my career change said Upledger uses indirect techniques, which means manipulation toward areas of greatest ease, to effect a release. Direct techniques, which she uses, mean manipulation to areas where clients don't like to move, to allow them to find a way to release. Which system works better? I don't think either because they've both worked for me, with the right practitioners. And they've both NOT worked for me, with the wrong practitioners. I do feel each technique is better suited to different situations. If I have a client who's more liable to self-heal given the chance, I might try indirect techniques. If someone is stuck and can't get out of that predicament himself, I'll try the direct techniques.  Of course each side poo-poos the other, which I think is not right. The direct therapist says: what are you going to do, just sit there waiting for something to happen? And the indirect therapist says the direct methods are too heavy-handed (which, given the right practitioner, I have not found that to be true). One thing is consistent with both practitioners (and even skilled students who have done craniosacral work on me): I fall into a deep slumber and miss everything!  I'm just thinking out loud as I begin hashing together material for my business website, TouchRelief.com. It's already up, but I'm thinking of a number of important additions. It's funny how, when you're not inspired, you could grind your gears for hours and get nothing done, no matter how hard you try. But once that pump starts to flow, it's impossible to stop it, and you have to write stuff down otherwise it stays in your head, floating around, gumming up the plumbing... I'm in the latter state right now, exhilarating since it's been awhile since I've been this inspired.  The inspiration is also coming from working on my business plan, which is shaping up nicely.
