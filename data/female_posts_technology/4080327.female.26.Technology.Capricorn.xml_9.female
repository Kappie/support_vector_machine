I want it in today", "Pauline, is it ready?", "No, this is not what I want. I want it to be in this way", "Pauline, can you add something to this for me".... and it goes on.  Anytime soon, I will be having a heart attack or maybe a nervous breakdown.  Why don't people plan? By planning, they will have everything ready and not do things blindly.  I really hope I won't be the one having a nervous breakdown.  Signing off...
