I realised its 1 June, and my sick computer that I promised to fix since Jan is still covered with dust. I will get to it soon, I have to, and I will do that.. this weekend maybe? Hehee.. Such a procrastinator.  On the subject of the matter of the heart, there seem to be new developments. Nope, no new guy (before you start speculating). Previously, I was afraid of falling in love. I don't know if I will ever, and if I should because I was afraid of the pain I might go through (as much as i enjoy pain haha). However, along the way (in the past 6 mths), I opened up my heart and mind again. I don't put a permanent "No entry" sign to love. Should love find me, I'll be ready to ride the emotion rollercoaster. And that kind of mindset still stands.   When I said developments, I was referring to a greater subject of love - marriage. With the change of time, society changes. Although weddings touch me (always sob at weddings.. :~( ), increasing divorced couples made me lost faith with marriage. These days, signing on the dotted line, vowing "till death do us part" do not mean any binding agreement or contract anymore. The couples are not promised of anything. (Maybe they should revise the wedding vow.) To me, marriage is only for the purpose of having children - starting your own family. Having said that, it doesn't mean that I won't consider marriage. I just have to be prepared, mentally and financially that the marriage might not work out. It is just how it is in the society now. Mankind have different attitude now. I may be able to be sure about myself but I won't know about my partner. People changes (I finally had to accept that) and s/he might not be the same person when you first met. I think I've also lost faith in man. Hahaha  My sis' advice - be in as much relationships as you can. Get broken hearted, it's ok.   She's right. It sort of prepares you. Then I'm dead!! I'm into my 26th years and I only have...have...*counting* 1 relationship!! ONE! Uno!! Satu!! 1!! From the look of it, I don't think more will be coming. Should I say it's just fate, or it's the way my life is, or it's the way how I lead my life? Even if I extend my options to the same sex, I still won't have that kind of 'fate'. Trust me. I know me, I know my life.   Well, of cos I can do something about it. Go out, get to know more people, widen your circles.. yeah yeah yeah, but not now. It's not my prioity now. (Does that sound like a procrastinator to u?)  So what's the conclusion? Take it as it comes (seem to have bcome my motto). You can never be prepared of whatever challenges that may hit you. In time of crisis, what do you need?   1. Time. To sort out the mind and emotion.  2. Friends/Family/Confidant. Someone you can unload to. Someone who can help you see out of the picture. You know, it's hard to see when you are in it. (See point 5) 3. Money. When you need to drown your sorrows, you gotta need money to buy those booze!! Hahha..  4. Self esteem. No matter what happen, don't forget yourself.  5. ME!!! =)  [If you are reading this, it means you belong to my exclusive club and hence this 5th point will be applicable to you. *wink* You need to know that I'll be here, if you need me. I may not do wonders but I'll do within my means.]  p/s: This is a super long blog. By the time I'm done, I'm no longer alone like the first paragraph. Haha.
