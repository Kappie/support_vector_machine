I tried to escape but he caught me and gave me one.  Karen and I arrived in style to the new Seasound Lounge.  The layered fluffy skirts were a big hit.  We ended up at the Down Under and danced a little bit.  I met two guys named Beau and Fritz.  I was sure their names were fake.  I met them when I went to the bar to buy a drink.  I put my fake Coach purse up on the bar and they both seemed to look at it and then made some comments.  It sounded like they were talking about real vs. fake and some sort of rating.  And then I saw them look at a few other girls.  I asked if they were rating people's purses and they were like no...boobs!  Then one of them said it was ok because they were married.  I asked if they were from San Francisco but they didn't get it, so I explained that's where gay marriages happen.  They were like OH NO!  Not to each other!!  I finally got my drink and told them I hope they find what they're looking for.  Caroline wanted to meet them so I did an intro then went back to the group.  Later they walked by and sort of looked at Karen so I introduced them and Beau said he knew her.  She didn't recognize him but then she figured it out.  Turns out he works on Windows Messenger.  Small world.   I let Sharalee's friends pick out my shoes, so I ended up with silver sparkly ones.  At the end of the night my feet were in pain.  Karen's were too.  (Is that grammatically correct?)  So we waited on some big rock while the guys bought us hot dogs.  Pretty cool.  I never did pay them back.  Karen runs with very nice gentlemen.  I assumed they were with her. :-)  While we waited for the hotdogs, a random Mexican serenaded us.   urlLink Click here to see the pics .
