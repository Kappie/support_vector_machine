I don't care if monday's black  Tuesday wednesday heart attack  Thursday never looking back  It's friday i'm in love   Monday you can hold your head  Tuesday wednesday stay in bed  Or thursday watch the walls instead  It's friday i'm in love   Saturday wait  And sunday always comes too late  But friday never hesitate...   Dressed up to the eyes  It's a wonderful surprise  To see your shoes and your spirits rise  Throwing out your frown  And just smiling at the sound  And as sleek as a shriek  Spinning round and round  Always take a big bite  It's such a gorgeous sight  To see you in the middle of the night  You can never get enough  Enough of this stuff  It's friday  I'm in love      i'm such a cheese.
