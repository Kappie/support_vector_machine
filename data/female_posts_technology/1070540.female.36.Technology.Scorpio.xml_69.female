I must get them, I know we do not have a cruel god, and that he will allow me to have my children of whom I love so much.  This week has not started out great, Ken and I have money problems, but it is something with alot of work we can over come. Notice I did not say Ken and I were having problems, just that we are having money problems.  We both want the best for our kids and us so we will get over this. I am not sure 100% how, but we will.  Its great to feel as much love for Ken as I do, I just wish I could really show him how much.  I do not understand my feeling of scaredness that I have when it comes to showing him that.  ON the way home frm taking Brian to witch, I had a lot of time to think,  I want nothing more and nothing less than to be with Ken and the four kids.  I know life is never going to be a piece of cake, but noone ever said that it would.  I wanted to call him up and tell him what I was thinking and how that I was feeling, It had such a hold on me,  I cried and cried, not really from sadness, but just because I love that man so much, I want to show him in everything that I do and say, and I am not good at that,  I really want to grow old with him (ok if you ask him, I am already old).  I never really thought about that with butt head.  But I think about that alot about Ken, I really want to grow old with him.   I came home for lunch today, not really planning on anything but seeing my hubby before he goes to work.We ended up making love, and I ended up crying.  I am truely scared that I am going to fuck up one of the best things that has ever happened in my life. I have one more dream of which I will not mention, but if this dream ever comes true, then I can tell you , that I know I will feel whole!  People say love is grand, but knowing you are loved is totally AWESOME.
