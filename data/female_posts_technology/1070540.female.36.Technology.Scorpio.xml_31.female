I can iron.  I dont mind helping me match since I cant see some colors....But it makes me feel so Inadequate when someone has to come into my house and do something I should be doing.  I have tried to be nice about it... and I did not mean to get ill, I could not help it,  I just wanted to cry.  It makes me feel that I am not doing what I am suppose to be doing and that I am a failure.   I have said this...over and over again...but yet noone cares.  It makes me think also that they do not like the job that I do when I do iron (which is every day but weekends) .   AND.....I NEVER!!  let the kids leave without combing their hair and brushing their teeth!   What it looks like when they come home from school I cant help.   Well I am done steaming....Its not really steaming its just that my feelings are really hurt.  I mean hurt bad.
