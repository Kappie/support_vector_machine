I can muse on cancer, but that'll be too depressing. Let me just say that the worst part of cancer is being mentally present, lucid, and acutely apprehending the deterioration of your own body.    Sat  -- Abby picked me up and we went thrift shopping in Redwood City. We went to Stacks pancake house and I tried to like pancakes again. Semi-successful. Then we went to Nordstrom, then Haight St. Between us, 4 pairs of shoes were bought.  I will not tell you the ratio of how many shoes to which Apple because that would only embarrass someone who is not myself. ;) At night we collaborated on an evening meal which consisted of runny polenta(me), chicken with basil and mushrooms(me), and a fresh salad(she) and roasted vegetable medley(she). After dinner I met up with W-gal and R-dude at the Quasi/ Sleater-Kinney show.    urlLink Sleater-Kinney    urlLink Quasi  @ The Fillmore 05-22-04    The music, fantastic. Janet Weiss, mesmerizing as always. Time magazine once named Sleater-Kinney "best rock band" and it's easy to see why. Janet Weiss is a phenomenal drummer, Carrie Brownstein has got some dextrous guitar fingerwork, and Corin Tucker, what a voice! And they all do double-duty: both Janet and Carrie sing back-up and Corin plays rhythm guitar. They are really good at what they do. I think they're not more popular because they're women, and their music is an acquired taste. It's a little inaccessible because it's not instantly catchy or toe-tappy. When I first listened to them in 1997 (Dig Me Out) I had to get used to Corin's wavery almost-operatic voice and their unrelenting self-seriousness and the challenging song structures. But once you get used to it, it's really rewarding. They can play, and they're not apologetic or deprecating about it.  During S-K's set, I kept smelling grilled meat and onions. ???   Quasi is a drumming showcase. Sam Coomes, the singer/ keyboardist provides light pop fare for Janet Weiss to spectacularly drum to. That's how I see it anyway. I pay no attention to him, only to her, for she is amazing. (The local opening band was Whysall Lane. They were alright. I'd seen them before opening for Erase Errata.)   ***    Sunday  -- Had brunch at Miss Minnie's with Abby and LingL. I had a peach puree mimosa. I'm making conscious efforts to drink more, to decide whether I even like to drink. I didn't before, and now with the influx of fruity girl-oriented soju drinks and delicious cocktails like sake martinis, I'm reassessing my stance. When I was with Dizzy D, he was an irresponsible drunk to the embarrassing point of being obnoxious in front of my friends and in restaurants, peeing on sidewalks, puking, not being able to get home, and passing out in our hallway. To every yin there is a yang, and in that relationship he was the selfish, puerile drunk so I had to be the mature responsible sober one. This is no longer the case, as I am a free agent now.  Afterwards LingL and I went to the Lumiere to see  urlLink The Saddest Music in the World  which was almost a waste of time. It's an arty film done in a German expressionistic style, but it was bad. I almost wanted to walk out because the dialogue was weak, the acting mediocre, and the film just plodded along without any depth or meaning. It was visually very appealing, but tedious because it was bad in all other aspects. It was neither sad, funny, or engaging; it was very bland and lacked chemistry between the actors and a core of cohesion. In the evening, Abby and I had a Sex and the City marathon. We watched all the episodes of the current season just released on DVD. I cried 3x. That show is very moving at times.  And that was my weekend.
