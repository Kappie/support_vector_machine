When I came home from work today, he was doing markedly better.  Last night, I found (quite easily, by the way) some message boards for Betta owners that is regularly moderated and has some fish experts.  No one has seemed to be able to diagnose what had been wrong with him yet, but I read several people talking about keeping their fish warm and keeping water movement to a minimum.  These are two things I had been doing wrong, so I turned off his filter and turned on the light to warm him up a little.  I actually got to sleep in my own bed tonight!    I know, this seems like a lot of trouble for a fish, right?  Well, it is - but if I'm actually able to kill a Betta, which are supposed to be resilient fish, then I'll never forgive myself.
