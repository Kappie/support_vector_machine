Does he not leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it? 5 And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders 6 and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, 'Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.' 7 I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.   We're the lost sheep, God is the shepherd.  He's gone out searching for us, and when he finds us it's a joyful thing.  It's a lot easier to rejoice over finding something you lost than it is to rejoice over something you always had and never lost.  You appreciate those things that much more.  So when God goes looking for us, and finds us, and we go with him, it makes him much happier than it would if we'd never been lost in the first place.  Maybe this explains why he made us sinners to begin with?
