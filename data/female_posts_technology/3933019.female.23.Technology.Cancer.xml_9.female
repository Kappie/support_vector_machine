The first one i came across was  urlLink Reshma's   . Had me hooked. I realised, here'a wonderful medium, just to let your thoughts flow and write and write and write.    As a kid, i loved to write.Somewhere down the line, maybe when i got to college, i lost the habit.Once i started browsing thro blogs, i began to think, hmm...why not me!!   So, I owe it to Resh, that i actually started blogging, and i'm glad i did too!!! I mean, i've really re-discovered the joys of writing!!! Boy!! Am I glad!!(I hope i'm not the only one who's glad!! :o))   Many bloggers i've seen are writers/wannabe writers. But i'm a software engineer. (What else can a Bangalorean be?!! hahaha!) A misfit?? Nah, i'm determined not to let that show!! Wellll, i'm trying atleast!!
