Dead skin cells, I mean.                        "Most humans naturally shed up to 3 grams of dead surface skin a day, some males make an extra contribution of 0.3 g/d in the form of dust from electric shaving. Although it may seem contradictory, it has been found that frequent showering increases skin cell shedding. Other research indicates that the majority of dust in a domestic bathroom is dead shed skin cells, especially after energetic towelling.

What I hate is when it scatters in closed places, i.e. fully-airconditioned homes, the metro, airconditioned buses. And people think it's just dust from the air, but it isn't. It's DEAD SKIN CELLS.      "Skin is alive. It's made of many thin sheets of layers of flat, stacked cells in which you'll find nerves, blood vessels, hair follicles, glands, and sensory receptors. Older cells are constantly being pushed to the surface by new cells which grow from below. When the old ones reach the top, they become wider and flatter as they get rubbed and worn by all your activity. And, sooner or later, they end up popping off like tiles blown from a roof in a strong wind. In fact,  every minute 30,000-40,000 dead skin cells fall from your body!  In approximately a month's time, your body has made a whole new layer of skin cells! "-->   urlLink  http://yucky.kids.discovery.com/noflash/body/pg000146.html
