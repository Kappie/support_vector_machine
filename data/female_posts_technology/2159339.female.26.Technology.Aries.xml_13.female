This is my first corporate job and I have many qualms with my occupation, but what I've been pondering lately is this: how is it that I've worked here for one whole year, and just recently I've become friends with someone truly awesome who's only two cubes away? Where was he for the last twelve arduous months?  I think it's that I have hipster anxiety. I can talk to anyone except really cool-looking people. I assume that they think they're better than me or too cool to talk to me. Which, in the throes of my brand-spanking-new friendship, is completely untrue. I think he's just shy so I assumed he was a snob. I'm really shy too so I'm sure he thought I was the same. It all boils down to why I hate corporations: you never really get to know the people you work with. Not like a small business anyway. I miss getting to know people really well and really liking someone and really hating someone.   2. Getting old. Yesterday, Sunday, I drove with my mom to visit three people: my dad, my aunt, and gramma-and-grampa. My dad is officially in a nursing home now. I hadn't seen him since he was transferred and he is skinnier and has random cuts and scabs over his body. He was wearing a diaper and wasn't wearing his bottom denture so his lip was sunken in like an old man. Though my mom cooed and clucked over him, I didn't feel pity. Something else that's been on my mind lately is how I would like to be unborn. How I would like to age backwards and essentially return to the womb, helpless and dependent, fetus, embryo, then nothing. I think that idea is actually what life is. Seeing my dad in an infantile state further convinced me of the cycle. You return to nothingness, but instead of reverting backwards, and reliving exuberance and happiness, you must progress forward through pain and loss of strength, both physical and mental. You become enfeebled, but instead of being surrounded by happy faces and people eager to caress your hands and cheeks, you're surrounded by tired nurses and resentful family that visits only on occasion. That is what you must endure to return to the nothingness.    My aunt has cancer and gramma-and-grampa are hooked up to feeding tubes. The grandparents haven't spoken for years. My grandma had this huge blackhead on her cheek and my mom picked it out. In Vietnamese they called it "chung ca" which literally translates to "fish's egg". If I was given the honor to name a blackhead in Vietnamese I'd call it "cut ca" which would literally translate to "fish's fece", because that's what it fuckin looked like. I'd be fuckin pissed off if I was fuckin 90-something years old and I was still getting pimples.  3. Depression. I told my mom I was depressed and that I was starting therapy next week. I didn't tell her before, because she's got enough troubles with my dad, aunt, and grandparents and all, not to mention her own ailments. She was very concerned and told me that I should come over for dinner more often and that she would do anything to help. I said I'd be okay and that the doctor will probably just prescribe me some meds then I'd return to normalcy. But, really, I don't need pills. I just need a new job that makes me feel needed. I'm not needed here because any monkey can pass out pens and post-its. I need to work for someone who needs  this  monkey. Preferably someone with an afro.
