But what if the person I choose doesn't return the feelings?  I have to look into it further.  I couldn't go through with a date that was planned. He went out with his friends instead.  I chickened out!  Nervousness got the best of me.  I hope he isn't mad.  I'm certain that he's disappointed.  I'll deal with him tomorrow.  I'll ask to go for lunch.  He's not too far from downtown.  Might be faster to walk than take the train.  I did chat online with the guy from work today.  He added me to his yahoo account.  I was stoked!  I guess that's a good sign.  He's more open on chat than in person.  Chat is probably more comfortable since you don't have to look at the person you're chatting with.  I wonder if conversation will change tomorrow when I see him.
