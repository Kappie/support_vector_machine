Before I went on the pill, I had 5 weeks of play before I had to deal with "Aunt Flo" and now, it's 3. That's annoying, getting my period every three weeks instead of five. That's friggin SEVEN more periods a year! Seven more periods of (suggested) abstinence! I brought up Seasonale with Abby, and she said the only drawback is that you wouldn't know you're pregnant til you're well into your second trimester. Ew. That is a drawback. Fetuses are gross. An interesting  urlLink article  states:   "Giving birth is the primary biological goal of the female body and without modern contraceptives women would be having a lot more babies and a lot less bleeding. Women in 1900 had around 150 periods in a lifetime; women today have closer to 450."  Very interesting. I would like to read more from opponents of this new pill, but a scientific-based piece, not religious or personal opinion.   But, much like people jazzed about Lasik or Botox, I am wide-eyed and eager for Seasonale. Because I hate periods! They ruin cute undies! And stain cute penises!!!
