Dad, brightened my day with his e-mail even though it's about the remittance that he sent.  Not that the remittance is not important.  It's just that he does not send personal mails as often as I like.  He's mostly busy with work I guess.  Nakahiligan ng mga officemates kong babae ngayon ang mga articles sa  urlLink Peyups   Ano daw ang  Italian Chandelier ?  Hmmm...dapat nagre-research ako kung pano ginagawa yung teddy bear e!  Ayun!  Imagine this.  Girl on bed facing roof.  The guy is the bed and the girl lifts herself up and down.  Kung ayaw nyo mag-imagine, click this  urlLink link .  I know, I know.  This is not teddy bear manual.  Whew.  Malamig kasi dito sa office.  Kauulan lang, see?  5:20 PM.  Serious na ulit.   GSC Quotes of the Day   "Akin okay lang kahit bastos"  - Tina to Jaz regarding e-mail   "Bakit bigla akong nawala, Jaz?!  Wala akong vacuum cleaner!"  - Shai to Jaz regarding e-mail   "Bakit 'Getting up immediately' requires 36 calories?"  - January referring to an e-mail forwarded to her about the number of calories burned under header POST ORGASM   "Mahirap tumayo afterwards kasi nga pagod ka nun e"  - My reply to "Getting up immediately"   "WHAAT?!"  - LOL.  Funny!  Kasi naman pumasok si Alex sa kwarto at sabi nya "Magre-resign na pala si Jing!"  Reaction namin "Uh...ano?"  So sabi namin labas sya ulit para masaya at saktong okay ang reaction namin isa balita nya.  Labas naman daw sya.   Hehe sabi nya corny na daw the second time around pero labas pa rin sya.  "Magre-resign na pala si Jing!"  Ang cute!
