"this is the way it goes... sometimes you're flush and sometimes you're bust; and when you're up, it's never as good as it seems, and when you're down you think you're never going to be up again. but life goes on, remember that."   For more of Poch and her wit/thoughts/angst/etc., well....she has to be your friend too!  Lucky me! Wooooohooooweeeeeeeee!
