(Brittany Murphy playing Courtney Love, Abby remarked astutely.) Watching Brody makes me long for Courtney Love. Courtney circa 1994. Courtney before she became a C-list drug-addicted attention-seeking wash-up. Geez, Courtney, get it together! Learn from your imitator. Get off the drugs! Take care of your kid! Play some good music! Brody started out as a Courtney-wannabe, but if she keeps at it, she's gonna exceed Courtney herself. Courtney, Courtney, where did your love go?  With me at the show were Abby, W-gal, and R-dude. The entire gang was there. We were there to be pushed to the side by the enormous violent mosh pit. Holy Hay-zoos am I getting old!
