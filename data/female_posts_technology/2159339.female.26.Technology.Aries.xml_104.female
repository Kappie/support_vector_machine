With dental bills piling all around my room and the credit card balance slowly creeping up instead of working its way down, I realized that the days of spending money recklessly and treating myself to takeout three times a day must stop. Along with that, I decided that some weekend work might be necessary. So I worked two shifts at the International Art Expo. Easy money, fun people and free lunch. And I got to run around the exibit hall and look at the most amazing paintings and sculptures I've seen in a while. Made by people with actual talent and not just hipster art fucks wannabes. That gave me one day off, which I spent working on the damn slipcover (it's almost done)...and hanging out with Dave, Ari, Batty, Green Marble and their big ass extended family. There was tons of food, wine and I think I heard some singing around 2 am...Today, K and I are visiting our former place of employment since Wendy's family decided not to have a funeral and we need closure. Then off to school for chem lab.   Mike is back in two weeks. I'm mostly looking forward to it and a little bit not. I don't want the petty fights but I want the other stuff - the home-cooked meals, movies, hikes and the..um..good stuff. I will book our flight to the Grand Canyon today. This means that I must start training tomorrow in case my donkey rental plan doesn't pan out. Crap. I hate excercise.
