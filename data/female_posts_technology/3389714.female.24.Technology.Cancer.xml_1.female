I don’t know y… I was up talking to friends till midnight… and had a blast…once I hung up the phone .. I decided to wash up for bed … came back to my room and got this sense of pure loneliness.. it was the worst feeling ever… I didn’t know what to do.. didn’t want to cry didn’t want to mope around feeling sorry for myself… seeing the room that I resided in made me feel that I lost myself in the past few years … I got into bed and attempted to think about happy thoughts.. but I couldn’t .. just couldn’t shake that lonely feeling … then I thought I’d think of names of all the people that really luved me .. I could only at the time name one .. GOD.. it was scary I know that there’s a lot of people out there that I’d like to think give a damn about me ... but my mind froze .. I began to think does god luv me .. I don’t even know him..never met him..yet I think he luvs me .. yah I know I was at my all time low .. perhaps it’s life takin its weird toll .. I need a serious vacation… Been stressed a lot .. it hard adjusting to change .. it can seriously do a number on you … I’ve decided from this point on I’m goin to make an extra effort telling my family and friends that I luv them..sometimes only actions don’t count ..i think sometimes people need to HEAR that they are luved … I know that I surely do…   Something to think about: When was the last time someone told u they luved u .. and u felt warm inside..u believed it ..it wasn’t just to be nice .. when was that last time?  PS: i'm seriously craving ... green skittles ... yummy...
