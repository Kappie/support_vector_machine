Vicki, Steven Taylor, Jamie McCrimmon, Deborah Watling, Zoe Herriot, The Brigadier, Sarah Jane Smith, Leela, K9 with Romana II, Tegan Jovanka, Nicola Bryant, Bonnie Langford, and finally Ace.  Billie Piper has a lot to live up to with so many great assistants.  I must confess my favorite assistant is Ace maybe because she didn't act like a normal assistant.  She was always going around blowing things up and saying "Wicked!" and "Ace" which enhanced the show.
