Entertaining guests always makes me a bit more active because I want to ensure they have a good time in SF. On Friday night we had drinks at the Hukilau with Green Marble's crew and on Saturday, we ate sushi at No-name, went to Japantown, caught the  urlLink Triplets of Belleville  at the Red Vic, then went to a party at my cousin's house.    My cousins were hosting a Mexican-themed party at their triplex/compound. (I'm really into that Mexican dish where it's meat and corn on the bottom and a layer of cornbread is baked on top? What's that called? Cuz I really like it.) My cousin, Duck-duck, likes to cook and her food is always delicious because the ingredients are fresh and she provides a smorgasboard of variety each time: there was that cornbread dish, enchiladas, carnitas, grilled chicken cubes, and all the fixins  plus  artichoke dip. For dessert she made rhubarb crisp and baked a mocha cake in honor of Abby's bday. She put candles on it and we processed into the living room singing "Happy Birthday" and it was funny because Abby was singing and looking around to see whose birthday it was. When she realized we were singing to her, she was really embarrassed. Hee-hee! Abby and I went home around midnight and fell asleep watching SNL.   On Sunday we went to see  urlLink 13 Going on 30 , which is actually pretty good for what it is. Afterwards we split up to spend Mothers' Day with our mommies. More on my mother's day later. Next show we're going to, as Abby is back in the fold:  urlLink The Distillers  this Thursday night.
