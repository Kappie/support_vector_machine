Seems to be an occasional activetopic dalliance, it usually shows up again, eventually.  Secondly, off topic as it might appear;  An email arrived on Friday, from a woman in Italy with a screaming baby and a job and not much spare time, and she ended her message with this expression, an expression just asking to be blogged;   "in the wolf's mouth and in the whale's bottom" (translation from Italian, meaning good luck).   I think it is may be one of those phrases where you throw up your hands in the air, tossing all three caution, hope and gravity to the wind at the same time.  And then you just smile, because luck ran out years ago, and it's the only thing left to do.
