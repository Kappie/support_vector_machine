Mom and Dad have agreed to help me with the downpayment, with the additional stipulation that this is the last time I get to borrow big money from them.     Yesterday I wrote up my offer at lunch. I think I was pretty reasonable; I asked for appliances, window coverings, and that the oil tank be topped-up. I bid a number a bit below the asking price. By dinnertime the counter-offer had come back: all appliances, window coverings, whatever oil is left in the tank since they just topped it up two weeks ago, and they only upped my bid by $1000! OMG I was jumping up and down when I heard that!!! I think I really lucked in there, but I also have to give credit to my realtor. Apparently the owners were somewhat attached to thier stove and washer/dryer; but my realtor convinced them to give me a break since I'm a new homeowner.     One big hurdle left to go; financing. I see the mortgage broker today after work and should know by weeks-end if I'm approved. Wow then it's inspection, lawyers, and I have to find a boarder for the third bedroom. I think I'm going to make a deal with my friend D to come live with us, and only ask for enough to get by comfortably.     Wow this is a lot to absorb in a short period of time! Everything seems to be on an upswing now for me, I'm a lucky girl.
