Due to time difference, lots of fans complain of the unstrategic times the matches shown 'Live' (6 30 hours and 8 30 hours SG time). One of them is  mon frere  who bears an excuse to Mama that job-hunting will resume after this competition is over.   Even, my non-watcher of football hubby, has been dilly-dallying the time around to drive me to office. Come on, hubby. Admit it. You must be ogling at those hotbods of the hispanic ladies who are cheering for their countrymen.  urlLink     Well, I myself admit admiring those beautiful chicanos flaunting their beautiful bodies in bikini-tops. The climate in Peru is known to be HOT, compares to Portugal I guess.  Rest case for fever 1.  With all the much talk about fondue, I manage to drag hubby out after yesterday's dinner for it. The last 'fondue' experience I had (if you may call that), was helping Mama doing the 'London Almond' cookies many, many Hari Raya ago.  We hit HD in Thomson's Plaza, ordered the fondue set to be shared, and a cup of bailey's coffee for hubby. We were 'dangerously poking' our 'catches-4-the-day' and dunked them into the 'boiling mud' with the skewers that set 'roaring' eyes  urlLink    from the passer-bys. But we the 'dangerous' couple couldn't care less and continued our 'vicious act'.  Later, we went to 'peep-peep' into the a dance studio, which I was forced-sent 10 years ago, all in the name for NDP  urlLink   . We had joy, we had fun under the sun. And I remember that was the time I met my one and only Chinese boiiiii-pren that I had, who were one of the 'Monkey-Monks' from CH. hihihi *coy*
