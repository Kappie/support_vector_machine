Which is weird, because that is not a mental state I frequently find myself in at any time of day, let alone in the wee hours of the morning (my few conscious 4:30 a.m. states are not usually sober ones).  So I ate breakfast, read a little, went to the gym, started some homework, and it was kind of nice to have an early start on the day, but there's no way those extra four hours made up for being fucking exhausted from 11:00 onwards.
