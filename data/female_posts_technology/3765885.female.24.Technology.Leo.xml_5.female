First time ever in my entire life... i had so many people to celebrate my birthday for me... and 2 birthday cakes... 2++ to be precise... and 200% improvement from the 0 cakes the past 2 to 3 years... its been so long... i can hardly remember. contrary... no cake on birthday itself... =( everyone i know were busy asking what i did on my birthday.. did i celebrate with my bf... but sad to say... no... i din... i spent the morning sleeping... downloading stuff... scrubing the pot which was charcoal blank cos i forgot that i was heating something up in the kitchen... and stuffing myself silly with steamboat stuff... what a way to spend an off day... let alone a birthday... gosh... on a happier note... i get to rest and relax on my birthday... no work units... the celebrations were pre and post... no actual... except for a little steamboat dinner with mum and sis... really wonder why i had taken the day off... no one to go out with... dissappointing... 3 years and 2 days of my relationship.. going strong... i guess so... or maybe... getting too used to it... still can't believe that it has been so long... all the ups and downs... amazing... maintaining a relationship is difficult... i wouldn't even want to think about marriage... oh my god... that would be more then just a challenge... not exactly the best birthday i have... but it was definitely good... with all the frens and colleagues and teammates who remembered... a big  THANK YOU !
