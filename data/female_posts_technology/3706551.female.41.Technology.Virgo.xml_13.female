I was at my friend's house yesterday and we talked about my current relationship with my husband.  During the conversation, my friend told me of a dream she had the night before that involved her ex-boyfriend and domestic abuse.  I feel very responsible for bringing up dark memories  experiences that are deep in her subconscious, yet come out in her dreams.  I feel that I have indirectly hurt her, and that hurts ME really badly.  I would never want to cause her any pain.  She is a dear friend, and I owe her an apology.  As well as a "cease and desist" from any further dialog regarding relationships from hell. Here's to SWEET dreams .... not dark ones :)
