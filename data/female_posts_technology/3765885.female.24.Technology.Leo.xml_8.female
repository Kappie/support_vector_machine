My Sony CyberShot. Finally a digi cam I call my own!!! *MUACKS* *MUACKS* Haven't really had the time to learn to use all the functions yet... but not too bad... manage to read parts of the manual and figured out how to do basic and simple photo taking. Gonna be using it for my convo photos! And of course... more and more photos as the days go by...  SAY CHEEZEEEE~
