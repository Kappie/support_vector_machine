You see, next weekend is Princeton reunions, and each year you need to look better and better.  The catch is that you need to look good while wearing orange and black.  I have a few outfits that should do just fine.  I even bought some orange flip-flips with heels.  Those were a mistake.  Who would buy flipflops with heels?  Ummm...me.  I don't recomment them.  But they were on sale!    Anyway, when I was trying on a blue/green skirt at Urban Outfitters, I was trying to move quickly, and I accidentally zippered my skin.  Ah!  That hasn't happened since I was a toddler and wore those one-piece pajamas with the feet.  Anyway, the big question was how to get free.  Do I painfully unzip?  I sort of tried but it was hurting and then somehow it just freed itself.  The morale: take your time in the dressing room!  Today I had my very first pedicure.  Can you believe I'm almost 25 and never got a pedicure?  Well I guess that's just the kind of person I am.  It always seemed like a waste of money.  Until today.  It was worth every penny of the $15 it cost.  And such a good color!  A nice dark red.  Overall, I'm very happy, and I think I'll be a returning customer to this place in Kirkland.  I never really liked my toes until today.  Now they're so fun!  They totally massage your feet and calves with lotion, so it was very lucky that I had shaved my legs this morning.  After the pedicure, I went down to the Kirkland waterfront to read and show off my toes.  It was overall a lazy, but good day.  Now I gotta grab dinner and get to Sopranos.  It's the second to last episode of the season!
