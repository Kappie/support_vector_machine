I'm not going to say "we" got a puppy, because he is mostly my dog, and I seem to be the one going out to take him for a walk all the time. We've only had him for a day, but boy, am I so excited!  He is a salt and pepper Miniature Schnauzer, 13 weeks old and I am keeping myself awake worrying about him (cause he sleeps most of the night).  I felt really guilty about leaving him in his crate today, especially since all the books I read (I did some major cram sessions with puppy books before getting him) say that he shouldn't be left in a crate for longer that 4 hours. Today hubby took a break from lunch to give him water and walk him but he won't be able to do it everyday. Sad. Everyone at work who's had a puppy before and who have dogs, tell me they'll get used to it and that's how they did it. I'm still sad. If only I worked closer to home!  So yeah, this is a majore development. My very first dog! I named him Toby and I will post a picture of him soon.  ***  On that note, I'd like to thank everyone's warm response to my previous post. To answer some questions:  Writing this post just felt really revealing. More revealing than anything I've written before. But I wanted to share my feelings, and wanted to write something as a tribute to my wonderful husband. He read it and appreciated it very much!  We've bene married for less than a year now, our 1 year wedding anniversary being on November 22nd. I would have liked our wedding to have been in August too but it didn't work out that way.  To everybody else, my usual routine is to go through each comment and reply to it, but forgive me. They've piled up without me replying every so often, and I am so sleepy now, even as I write this post. I read every one of them though and wish to thank you all for all the positive responses.  Thank you all. Now, I MUST SLEEP  ***  Coming Soon:  Bedroom Fortunes...finally an update!
