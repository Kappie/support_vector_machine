I ate too much breakfast. My ankle is still swollen. I havn't been to the gym in 4 days.   Positive? Yes please.  I got some much needed exercise this morning. My car should be sold soon. We need the rain to prevent draughts like last year. I was starving when I got to work and Trina had breaky waiting for me. I need to be easy on my ankle and knee and not being at the gym has allowed me to rest up.   You pick which version you like...I don't like either.
