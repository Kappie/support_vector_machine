We are talking about SANDWICHES here  . My MOST FAVORITE packed-meal, because it's the easiest meal ever. Stuffed, grilled, fried or baked. No matter how you slice it, SANDWICHES are a quick, satisfying solution for any meals. They're simple to make, kids-friendly, and always a hit. You don't have to limit SANDWICHES to ONLY lunchtime. When it comes to dinner issues, what should matter to most of us -- ease of preparation, a healthy, well-balanced plate -- the midday staple might just be the perfect rush-hour solution. I know, I know. Asians, typically wants to see rice on their plate as staple need. But you know me. Very un-favorite of eating rice.   If you need convincing, I think start today, and a few days onwards, I shall share a few SANDWICH, handheld meals in this blog, that should do the trick. Perhaps next time if people ask, "What's for dinner?", just tell them: LUNCH.       Salmon Club with Avocado Butter     total time: 15 minutes      | makes 2 sandwiches   Salmon is my hubby's FAVORITE-est of all fish, and FAVORITE-est eaten raw. Not for me though. And I love my sandwich to be either on 9-cereal or Light-Rye bread. You can kindly pick up both from Delifrance, and kindly request the loaf to be slice.   1 ripe avocado, pitted and peeled  Juice from half a lemon  2 tbsp of unsalted  pepper  butter  1 tsp of grinded oregano leaves ( kapur  from co ... yet again)  1 1/4 tsp of salt  1 8-ounce salmon fillet, sliced into 3/4-inch pieces  6 slices of 9-cereal/Light-Rye bread  1 1/2 cups of lettuce   Place avocado, lemon juice, butter, oregano and 3/4 spoon of salt in a food processor (blender). Pulse until nearly smooth, about 30 seconds. Set aside.   Place a medium nonstick skillet (fry-pan) over medium heat. Coat with a bit of cooking oil. Sprinkle the salmon with the remaining salt and place in heated skillet. Cooked about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate.   Assemble 2 sandwiches, using 3 slices of bread per sandwich. Alternate the bread, avocado butter, salmon and lettuce. Could secure with toothpicks before serving.   Happy Trying! Tomorrow another SANDWICH recipe!
