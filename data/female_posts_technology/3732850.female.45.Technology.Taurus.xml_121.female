Fighting back for so many is just an instinct that is done before thought has a chance to take place. Wormley however was raised to think before he acted. I really liked this essay for pointing out that fighting back may not always be the best answer. Sometimes thinking your way through a situation may lead you to a better result and feeling about yourself.
