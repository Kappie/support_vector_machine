When the father gives: the father is happy, the son is happy. When the son gives: the father cries, the son cries.    In those hours of the night  / Translated by  urlLink Michael B. Smith  with minor creative changes by myself for rhyming purposes. (Original can be found  urlLink here )  In those hours of the night, the hours very late ,  When it is quiet, With only the faint sound of the A/C,  They arise within me, all those thoughts— of forbidden trait—  And the repressed, numbed urge awakens within me.  And in those hours of the night, then, at last I have permission  to stop everything, and return to myself for a brief rite,  And from within arises a distant, hidden recollection,  Of everything that was - perhaps, and of all that happened - but not quite.  And then, in those hours, the true hours of the night, I want it so much, and it is hot and it's ablaze ,  And all the urges gush into those letters that I write,  And then morning comes again, and the urges go away.
