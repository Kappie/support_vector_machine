If you know that it will leave a deep wound, would you still fall in love?   If you have not loved, have you been missing out? If you had a choice, would you fall in love again? Why do you fall in love? Why do you take the risk? Why would you cry when your love leave?   Maybe my heart is too fragile to take the risk. Maybe I'm a coward. Maybe I'm not adventurous. Knowing the pain, I shut my heart. Am I bluffing if I said I did not shut it? This is probably why I won't be surprise if I'll be single for life. I wonder if I'm too picky or I'm not daring. Either way, it doesn't matter. Love can be given away in many ways.   No matter how you love, you will cry. So love with all your heart. Dry your tears, mend your wounds, get on with life. This is the road you choose. Enjoy the roller coaster ride.   "I'm so tired of being here. Suppressed by all my childish fears. And if you have to leave, I wish that you would just leave, cos your presences still lingers here. And it won't leave me alone. These wounds won't seem to heal. This pain is just too real. There's just too much that time cannot erase. When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears. When you 'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears. And I've held your hands through all of these yrs. But you still have, all of me...." --  My Immortal , Evanescence
