Let's go back a bit to set the tone of this story...I recently treated myself to some new workout clothes; a flattering sleeveless navy-blue tank top and white shorts. I bought the white shorts specifically because they were so impractical, don't ask what strange thoughts rambled through my mind that day!  So I arrive at the ball field in my stylin outfit, what a gorgeous hot day! I cross the street only to be met with a small ditch between myself and the ball field. I was so pumped to do well at practice I didn't notice the bit of water that lay just around the roots of the tall grass until I was right on top of it. Trying to dodge the water last-minute I of course slipped and landed in the mud and grass and stagnant dirty water right on my ass. My pristine white shorts were soaked and muddy, and me with no change in the car. On standing up the first comment made, by my coach no less, was "Gees Amy what'd ya shit yerself?". Thus my nickname was decided. With every bit of pride I could muster I continued on with the practice, muddy wet shorts and all. I had a blast.   I was disappointed to see that the downtown clasic movie was not showing tonight, was it not rained out yesterday? Can anyone fill me in on this?  Oh and a special hello goes to space_coyote from paprika! *wink*
