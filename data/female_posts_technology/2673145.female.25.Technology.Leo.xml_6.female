That's something to look forward to. I won't allow anyone to piss me off (which already happened). No one can spoil my holiday week!  So what's in the itinery for you this long weekend? My whole family (the Lims + 1 son-in-law + 1 boyfriend/future son in law + 2 grandkids = 10) are driving up to KL/Genting for the long weekend! Will I happen to catch anyone of you at the 2nd link? ;)
