I got home to my oh so wonderful house, made some notes about updates to my website, ran by the grocery store, cranked wild tunes while making a scrambled egg dinner....and then sat forlornly at my little card table in the dining room while I ate dinner by myself.  I really do detest sitting at a table and eating a meal by myself.  I suppose it's why I've eaten dinner with the television for the past 10 years or more.  It's entirely too much time to think.  Especially when I'm faced with the realization that I am all by myself.  A bit of harsh reality for someone who typically enjoys life and being around others so much.  So last night all the sad pitiful questions, and their mean feeling-sorry-for-myself answers, were floating around in my head.  Sigh....it was pretty pathetic.  As for this morning....well I'm still feeling too fat, not financially successful enough, unsexy, and completely unloveable.   I'm countering that with bright red lipstick and a lime green shirt.....not to mention the anticipation of a margarita outing with some friends this evening.  :o)  Oh...as for the website, well I'm working on that more today.
