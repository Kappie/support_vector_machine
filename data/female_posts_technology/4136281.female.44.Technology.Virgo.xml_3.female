All the guys were working on getting schools put back together today...Matt worked at NV in the Pub to get it back up and networked; will have to set aside some time to see if we can get the OS upgrade done that Sarah requested before schools starts. Bart cleaned up the last of CE, then came over to get stuff that needed to be moved from HI. I was working on getting the Macs at HI hooked up and reformatted as necessary. All that's left over there is the Lab and grades 1 and 3. Craig was working TS and took a machine over to NV for me....seems that we are doing OK hitting the high spots, so far. I will be up half the night finishing up the email stuff for the subs....not enough hours during the day and it needs to be done before Thurs, cuz they need to get their info for the treasurers office.  Marching Band is going great for NV....the drum line is kicking major butt and they and the drum majors could be the thing that puts Band over the top as the best thing about football. Gene B is doing cool new stuff for halftime and the drum line got extra rehearsal before regular band camp; which really seemed to get them pumped up for the season. personally, can't wait till next week to see them on the field again....I know it will be awesome!!!  Be back later.....bye!
