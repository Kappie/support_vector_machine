This part is "showoffs always run the risk of being thought immodest, of being harshly viewed as...well...showoffs.  This brought me back to high school where a classmate of mine was the one showing off. This was especially true in volleyball and it didn't help that the coachshowed favortism toward her. This gave her more room to show off with spiking the volleyball.  She was good at everything. She had good grades, voted for as homecoming queen, well-liked and popular, also a showoff. She was a big time showoff and everyone in our class knew it. There was no competing with her. She was known to many as a class pet to most of the teachers.  Now older, I see her showing off is not as bothersometo me as itused to be in high school. I think being older has changed my perspective as shejust has more money and is spoiled.   The old version I find her being the teacher's pet in almost every class. The new version is I still find her snobbish, at times. I find herto now be activein enjoying life and helping out society in a way that makes her feel a part of good in herself such as painting smiley faces on kids at the carnivals or Sunday school teacher and helping out with vacation bible school.   Ithink we all find our way of showing off from time to time, sometimes in a goodway and sometimes not in a good way. Most of us, I think, just want someone to appreciate us for who we are. Some of us are more modest in our showing off and some of us seem to flaunt showingoff more than others. I tend to find myself in the modest part where my classmate is the one to flaunt herself.
