I had some orange sorbet afterwards, and damn was it good. You know what's neat? I don't really feel like I'm dieting. I just feel like I'm eating more normally. Meals instead of random food that I grab.  Also, the weekly weigh-in results suggest that I have lost more weight! Between one to two pounds. I can't believe it, I hardly exercised at all this week. Also, here is something REALLY neat....I thought my stomach has been getting flatter, so just for shits and giggles I measured.  Unless I'm measuring differently than I was before, I have already almost lost an inch from my waistline. I doubt all of that is fat loss, some of it can probably be chalked up to the random bloating and shrinking that women go through, but still, that's impressive. I think I've also lost almost half an inch from each upper arm as well. I didn't measure anything else, but my pants are fitting better all over. If I keep it up, I might just surpass my own expectations, and frankly, that would be GREAT. Talk about motivation.  So the plan this week is not going to be as ambitious as last week. I think I should stick to aiming for at least half an hour five times a week. Basically that means trying to do something almost every day. I am going to the gym tonight. I plan on doing 30 minutes of cardio, and hopefully 30 minutes on the weight machines if I can figure out how to use them!  I hope everyone is as excited as me to keep going!
