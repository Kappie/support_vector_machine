I was the only person on the 7:07 downtown express in a costume, let alone a costume with bloodied baby parts and hairy chest. The baby is Kuato, leader of the resistance, and I am his host, "George". This is from the movie Total Recall, starring our governor. I was the only one on my BART train too.  At work, it is a completely different experience than at your office, A. There's a voting ballot for best costume, so everyone parades up and down, walking in and out of cubicles, visiting and voting. It feels very neighborhood-like today, with people milling about and smiling and chatting. The only thing missing is alcohol.  About 30 people dressed up, but there's a lot of inter-department decorations with eyeballs and spiderwebs. The people who dressed up REALLY dressed up. Here are some notable co-workers: HULK HOGAN, Cruella de Ville, Bride of Frankenstein, and Nina fuckin Hagen! NINA HAGEN!! Oh my lord, I wish Halloween was everyday. I could almost say that I love my work today, but my supervisor is negating my festive mood by reminding me to fold those invitations for the mailing. She's reminded me three times already. I can only write this because she's upstairs getting her check.   I'll write more later. One more positive thing about this holiday at this douche-y job: pizza lunch!  Hang in there Fidel. It's hard to be a revolutionary-cum-dictator.
