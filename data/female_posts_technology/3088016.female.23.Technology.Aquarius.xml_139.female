When asked if I thought we had ever gone to the moon, I, without hesitation replied that I believe we went to the moon. I am not naive, I know that many events in our history did not occur exactly the way that our history books said they did. I know that it really wasn't the tooth fairy that left money under my pillow. I don't think that our government, even if they wanted to, faked us out and staged the moon landing.    This is a link to the article that refutes the hoax claims on the NASA website: urlLink http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/News/2001/News-MoonLanding.asp   I am only looking at one side of this issue today. Please let me know what you think!
