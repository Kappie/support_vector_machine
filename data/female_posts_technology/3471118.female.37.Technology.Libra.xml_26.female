God has a purpose, and it isn't going to be thwarted.  Rain and snow come down from heaven, nourish the earth, and create food for eating and profit -- it has a purpose.  God's word is the same way.  He's not just putting it out there for no reason, he's giving it to us so that we can do what he wants us to do with it.  That purpose is going to be achieved, it's not going to be thwarted.  And his purpose is for us to have inner joy and peace, knowing the truth of God's word, and to spread the message to other people.  All of God's creation will benefit (and rejoice?) from our doing what God wants of us.  It's good to remember that God has a plan, and it's going to be followed to the end, exactly the way he wants it to, and nothing that we or anyone else does can stop that.  That gives me some confidence to know that I don't have to be in control of every little thing.  What God wants to have happen is going to happen, and what he wants not to happen, won't.  I just need to trust in him and do my part, which is what he wants of me.
