The birds were donated to the Parks and Wildlife organization in Quezon City.  For those looking for Chinese or Japanese cds and tapes, go to  Mei-Ah  located along Ongpin in Binondo.  Heaven.  And speaking of  Binondo , you should check out the great  fountain  in front of the  Manila Post Office .  Hehehe.  Best if you visit at night.  The most wonderful display is there.
