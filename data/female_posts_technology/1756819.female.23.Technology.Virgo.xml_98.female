Now I'm torn, I thought Florence would be a nice place to live, but now I think that I would prefer Paris, or maybe someplace in the French countryside.  We didn't spend any time in the country, but what I saw from the train was absolutely gorgeous.  I just loved the little towns nestled into the rolling hills.  Plus it would be the perfect opportunity to work on my french, not to mention the cute french guys ;)  The ones in Spain aren't bad either, but its a lot more difficult to talk to them (not knowing Spanish).  But now its back to reality and the regular grind.  *sigh*  Vacations are never long enough.
