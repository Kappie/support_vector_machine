He went to work one day and never came home. I will always remember that morning. I awoke earlier to study for an exam I as writing that morning. I noticed smoke out the front of my living room window and then received a phone call from my grandmother asking if dad was working today. I replied yes, why. And she told me that there was an explosion at the refinery. I instantly knew something was wrong. Duane showed up to pick me and Madison. My dads parents were suppose to watch Madison well I wrote my exam and we were dropping her off. I expressed my concern to him and told him I had to leave and go to see what happened. He kept reassuring me that no one was hurt as that is what the radio was stating, however I knew deep down that that was not true and I found out I was right as soon as we drove into my grandparent hacketts yard. My cousin and uncle, who works with dad, were there. My cousin broke the news to me. It was horrible. I will never ever for get the feeling that I experienced that morning as soon as I seen the smoke and knew it was from the refinery.  Questions we ask, and still no reply  One's like "what if", "how come" and "why"  But time nor words could ease the pain Because each year on this day We re-live it again A thousand tears and more we shed,  A thousand words, left unsaid  All of a sudden you were taken away  And nothing could've prepared us for that day.  Deeply missed, day and night,  Always in our hearts,  only gone from our sight.  Love you always dad.
