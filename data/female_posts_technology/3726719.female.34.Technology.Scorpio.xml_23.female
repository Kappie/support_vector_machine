I ws tossing around the idea of completely getting rid of my home phone now that I have Comcast.   I'm bailed on that idea....I'm piggy backing the home and cell phones for a bit.  After a phone call I got tonight, I might decide to ditch the home phone soon though.  More on that later.  The best news of the day?????   My new palm pilot finally got here!  So did the case for it!!  It's charging as I type and I am so ready to be synced up again.  Boy did I miss it.  Remember the recent post where I expressed disappointment in J for not calling me on Saturday?   Well, I had a voice mail message from him when I got home for lunch today.  Called him back.  He said he tried to call me a couple times and didn't leave a message.  He thought I had caller ID and would see that he called.  He asked when he would get to see me again.  With this weeks work schedule I told him it was very unsure.  He said he would call me in a couple days.  See...had it not been for the phone call I got this evening, I would actually be pleased about this.  Alas, I'm wondering what kind of person J really is.  The phone call was from a woman claiming to be J's current girlfriend of 3 years.  Nope, you never really do want to get a call like that.  UGH!!!!!  :o)   She wanted to know if I would stop calling J, where he and I met, etc.  And I really wouldn't have doubts about him except for one thing - I've only ever called him on his cell phone.  You pretty much have to be around that phone to get my home number.   Which tells me he's either lied to me or is being horribly stalked.   Whichever, I'm pretty sure we can write Mr. J off very soon.  Since I've deleted my online personals profile and account, I'm left with one potentially promising man.  Mr. B.   We traded some IM's today.  He asked me to e-mail him one of the pictures that was posted on my profile.  Still seems like a basically sane person.   We'll see how that goes!
