I feel so bad because I'm SOOOOOOOOOO FAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and everyone else is so tiny and beautiful .. and they have a guy or guys look at them. I look like a mom (a 30 - 40 year old mom who's had like 5 kids). I'm only 25 and look like this already .. what happens when I get there? Well I won't be a mom because no man will ever want me .. right .. who would want to sleep with something like this, case in point my ex boyfriend. So yeah I think there's no reason for me to lose weight. If I DO lose weight that would mean I'm changing who I am and i don't want to do that. What if I meet a guy and i'm all tiny and nice but then when my weight goes up, he'll dump me (because real love like in the movies does not exist). I am so sick of living like this. I am so sick of life.
