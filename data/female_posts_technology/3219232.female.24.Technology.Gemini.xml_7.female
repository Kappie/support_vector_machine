So my answer would be that some people turn their work into their lives. It becomes so boring that they would have to add spice into it. So the spice would have to be gossip. It’s like the work place becomes a soap opera or some tv show and the gossip is the story line. Work can only be interesting if it’s your passion and that if you’re a workaholic but to a lot of people it becomes routinary and boring. So gossip adds the humor, the drama, the conflict and to sum it all up, it adds excitement. It’s terrible if you become the subject of the nasty rumors around, but I tell you, every person is a subject at some point. Gossip circulates and everyone gets picked for a story line or two.
