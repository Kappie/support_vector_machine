First, a responsible thing:  I purchased a copy of " urlLink The Complete Idiot's Guide to Personal Finance in Your 20s and 30s ."  If anyone needs this book, it's me, but I needed it about five years ago even more.  They should issue one copy of this book with Baby's First Mastercard that we all start getting applications for when we're about twelve.  I remember myself at 18.  "What's this?  A thousand dollars in free plastic money?!  And I can pay it back whenever I feel like it?!  Let's go to bartending school!"  Just like that, $700 gone.  As you can see, I've long been a subscriber to the  It's Shiny and I Want It  buying philosophy.  To my benefit, I'm getting better, though not as quickly as I would wish.  Now, the irresponsible thing:  I noticed that my debit card was gone.  Not in my wallet.  Vanished.  I tried to mentally retrace my steps, particularly when using the card.  I could clearly remember going to the ATM on Sunday.  I took my money.  I took my reciept.  I don't remember taking the debit card.   I figure they cancel each other out, so I'm about even.  In an effort to do something effective, I have spent the past two hours organizing my bedroom.  Still don't feel any better about losing the card.  Tomorrow when I go to the credit union and ask for a new one, I'll see if they can give me two backups, just in case.
