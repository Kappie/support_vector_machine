To try to describe the works I saw today simply lead to sensory overload all over again. So many many many colors and images and sights and sounds of the museum, the smells of the visitors, (not all good) it was just SO intense.  And something I wouldn't trade for the world.    If someone told me a year ago I would be in SF twice in one week, viewing  real  art each time, I would have said they were crazy. While art is still like many subjects in my life, I am sorta kinda starting to get it.  I definitely know what I like, definitely know what I don't like and the millions of works that lie between are eye candy right now.    It was just amazing. The day was so awesome, wonderful sights, wonderful company, wonderful conversation.  Just enjoying life with a couple of friends.  I'm not sure it gets much better than that.    I am so very tired though and that extra hour of sleep tonight is going to be put to good use!
