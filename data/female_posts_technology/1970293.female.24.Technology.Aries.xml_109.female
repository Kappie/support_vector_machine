Deep in the woods hidden in a small glen, Morrigan and her mother danced and sang around the fire celebrating the new year.    A hand reached through the brush and slowly pushed it aside.  A face appeared in the opening, watching the celebration with avid interest.  Slowly the young face smiled and disappeared back into the woods.    A few hours from dawn, Morrigan and her Mother put out the bonfire and hurried back to the hut to clean up.  They could not be seen like this or the villagers would suspect something was wrong.  Morrigan tingled inside from the celebration.  She knew she wouldn't sleep the last few hours of the night but sit and daydream for a while.  She hurried and changed her clothes, washing her skin before putting on her plain clothes.  She put her colorful celebration clothes away until the next festival.  She mixed the concoction that would return her hair back to the dull brown color that hid her fire brilliance hair.  Her mother did the same with her hair and her clothes.    Soon the sun would be up and things had to be the same as yesterday.  Morrigan hated this hiding but there was nothing she could do.  Suddenly there was a scratching at the door of the hut.  Morrigan hurried with her hair to allow her Mother to finish hiding everything.  She walked over to the door with a fear in her heart for it was still quite late for someone to be calling a social call.    She opened the door slowly.  She looked at Aidan leaning against the door.  "What are you doing here at this hour?"  She asked quickly as she glanced back at her Mother before glancing back at him.  "I couldn't sleep.   I was just wondering if you were up yet so we could go for a walk in the dark."  Aidan asked quietly as he nodded a hello to Morrigan's Mother.  "Oh okay.  Let's go for a walk."  Morrigan grabbed her shoes quickly, smiled at her mom before gliding out the door.    "Let's walk over here for a bit away from the village."  Aidan quietly used his hand on her elbow to guide her way over the rough ground.  "Tell me what's going on, Aidan."  Morrigan asked after a few minutes of hushed silence between them.  He was her best friend who always seem to be there when she got into trouble.  There had been times when she used her craft accidently and he always seemed to be there to guide her way out of the trouble and back to her hut.  He was several years older than her sixteenth year.    "I saw you and your Mother tonight.  You seemed so different with your red hair flowing down your back instead of this dull brown.  I never seen you so carefree before."  He smiled as he pushed her down on a large rock and sat down beside her.    Morrigan gasped quietly.  "Aidan, what exactly did you see tonight?"  Morrigan had to know his thoughts about tonight.  "I saw you and your Mother celebrating your Samhian.  I know you are both witches so don't worry.  I knew since the first time I saw you get angry with one of the other children and fire lit up your green eyes.  I won't tell.  I'll protect you if anyone found out.  You know that don't you?"  Aidan said quietly looking into her eyes.  "Yes I know that you would protect me.  You always seem to be there whenever I would get into any sort of trouble.  How do you feel about me being a witch?"  Morigan had to know.  "I don't mind you being a witch.  It is your heritage after all, right?"  Aidan asked as he watched the sun slowly rise over the horizon.  "Yes it is our heritage.  Every woman born in my family with red hair has the ability for the craft.  Usually it's mother to daughter but every now and then a woman will have more than one daughter with one powerful daughter and the other with no abilities."  Morrigan had no idea why she was telling him the secrets of her family but she was so she hoped she could trust him.   To my husband
