I have never read a book about the Pakistani way of life and it is just so interesting.  ***  Two days ago, I promised my husband I would wake up early in the morning and cook him a Filipino breakfast, as in, SPAM dipped in egg and fried ;b, plus sinangag na kanin.  I failed to wake up early enough (8:00 am). Yesterday morning, I got up at 8:50, took a quick shower, peeked into my husband's slumbering figure and told him that it would help a lot if he fixed me my lunch.  So he got up and cooked bacon and toasted bread, and also fixed me my lunch.  I thanked him profusely.  As I was about to leave, he looked at me.  "That was a really good Filipino breakfast!" he joked.  My husband, the joker.  Last night I told him I'd try to wake up this morning and again try to cook him the egg-dripped fried SPAM but this morning I failed again!  ***  I've been trying to read some new people's blogs but I can't seem to get into them.  I don't know why. I can't possibly have tapped all the good blogs out there.  Is it possible I'm blog-saturated because of the ones I already visit?  I'll have to ponder this some more as I continue surfing the net.....
