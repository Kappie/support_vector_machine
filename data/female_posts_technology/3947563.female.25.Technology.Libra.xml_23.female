I had a shake for breakfast, an apple for a snack, another shake and some broccoli and cauliflower for lunch, another apple for my snack, and then the same chicken and potato for dinner. I mixed things up a little by trading beans for corn on the cob tonight though. Oooh ahh, ha ha. I also had some salad with my dinner, which I must say was a welcome addition. I love salad.I had a cup of this cheerios mix stuff tonight for a snack, which Mr. Label says contains about 162 calories. I gave in and had a coffee today though, bad bad. I'm sure there is a good 300 + calories in a large double-double you know. From now on, it's tea with milk and sweetener. Forget the food, the coffee will be the hardest sacrifice for me.  I am sure getting sick of apples though. I have changed up tomorrow's menu a little bit. Also, I did well for water and vitamin today, that makes 3 days in a row. That might be a record.   I even squeezed in TWO workouts today. I did pilates before work this morning - which was probably a waste of time because I was so sleepy and stiff - and went for an hour long bike ridetonight at a comfortable pace. I also returned my library books. That has nothing to do with this, but I'm just so proud, lol.  Does anyone else find they are thinking about food a lot? I constantly seem to be thinking about food or exercise or drinking water. I guess it's good so I won't forget, but my brain is tired.  Actually, I'm tired! Goodnight! And keep it up girls, everyone is doing so good. We passed hump day!
