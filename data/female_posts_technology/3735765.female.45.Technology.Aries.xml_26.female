Guatemala is a beautiful country -- beautiful mountains, beautiful Mayan temples/pyramids, beautiful culture, and so much more.  I loved meeting the people there and I missed not going again this year due to my own financial situation this year; however, I have many photos that were just amazing and memorable that I reflect on often.  I have many tapes that I recorded sounds and voices of meetings and discussions that we had during our mission trip.  I hope to be able to get them slowly translated through the Monday Mission Minute series I will do on this blog site.  I really am looking forward to sharing reflections and transcriptions with you.  If I can figure out the photo inserts on these blogs, I shall be sharing those with you as well.  The trip involved meetings with other preachers and Church programs,  CEDEPCA ,  CESSMAQ , a women's coop making Guatemalan fabrics, a Mayan Priest, and many noteable villages.  The trip was sponsored by the  Presbytery Mission .  It was a trip that I will certainly never forget the faces of the people I spoke too and saw.  I am looking forward to sharing with you my memories of the Guatemala trip.  I wish I had known about these blogs back then; I would have certainly created my Guatemala diary log back then... :)  Hasta la vista!  ps  I have decided to make this series its own blog at  Bluebonnet Missions !  Look forward to seeing you there!! :)
