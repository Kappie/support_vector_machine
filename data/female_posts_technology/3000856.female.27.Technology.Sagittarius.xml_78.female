I think I have way too much on my plate right now, and I want alot in certain areas of my life and I am not getting them right now. I really need this vacation coming up.  I think if I did not get this vacation that I would end up having a nervous break down or something.  Sounds sad but true.  Leaving for FL on the 19th and wont be back til the 27th! THANK GAWD! Still looking for a job, still hoping we find a drummer, and still stressed about things I should not be stressed about. Have to go see a chiropractor, I was told that that would actually help my illness.  Don't know how true it is but I will try anything.  Collen has been sick he is complaining that his head hurts really bad.  If this is not better by Sat I am bringing him in.  He has always been a healthy child.  He was in the hospital when he was 3 for scarlet fever and they thought he had a bacterial infection. That was scary. They had my poor baby in a bubble away from everyone and everything just in case that was the problem.  Gonna get some stuff done b4 I leave.  Leaving at 1 today. YEAH! Oh yeah, Collen, me my dad and mom are going to see Harry Potter at the IMAX theatre on Sat morning.  He will love that! OK Tootles.
