He also realizes that he made a HUGE mistake in letting this awesome Chick go for some psycho crazed baby-wanting nut.  It only took him over six years to get there.  Maybe it was turning 40 that did it.  Found that to be interesting when he told me all that.  Doesn't mean that I have any feelings for a human suit container for water, tho. :D  Other thing I learned was that Todd L was damn cool!  He watched my babies while I was in the Great White w/ the fam.  He also gave me 4 tixs to Irish Fest.  Now I just have to find 3 other folks that want to go, not on that Sat night.  I have a bit of time for that, so put it on your calendar.  Todd came over every night and spent time w/ Midnight.  He (Midnight) is such a social pig but I'm glad he's back to being nice to folks.  Little girl...well maybe she'll follow her brother on this like she has so many others of his good/bad habits.  Thanks Todd!  Learning that I can type 3 different types of directions in a total one days' time can happen.  Yikes that was so not fun.  I still have to document more of what I do.  Man that sucks most days.  The upside, well that I can do that and get all the details in w/o too many revisions.  Damn I'm good! ;)  South Pacific is just so vast, beautiful, and loaded with possibilities of all sorts.  Sorry I keep bringing up the SP but man...until I book something, I'm pumped and ready to just fly there tomorrow.  Ah..deal with it, as some friends would say. :)  My dad (g-dad that is) was reading some of the books I brought up and he couldn't figure out what island HE would go to.  Agreed w/ me that Fiji might not be the place for a single girl to go at any time, unless it's one of the more exclusive/expensive resorts.   Family, I believe, should be taken in small doses of less than a week.  Especially when there are kids involved.  Don't get me wrong.  I love kids, niece and nephew included but there is something to be said for quiet nights, peaceful fishing times, and sleeping in late.  Well the above leads me into the fam vacation week of well...last week.  I'll give you the doses of that at another time.  Trust me there's more.  Lots more. :)  Here's what I want to know.  Was thinking lately what others might decorate room with as in furniture, paint and wall hangings.  Let's start with the most used room - the Bedroom.  What?!  We sleep most of our lives say the stats anyway.  So what's in your room?  (details please)
