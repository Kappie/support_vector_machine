This is why I've always disliked parties.  I love the concept of a party, the organisation, the food, the careful selection of the music. But the reality is quite different.  Getting a group of disparate strangers to stand around chit-chatting is a lot more difficult than you first think.  I just can't do it anymore.  The thing though, is that in a desperate attempt to be a 'party person' I end up doing the most talking, however, the talking consists of an endless barrage of questions from me, and then, not actually listening to the answer because I'm inside my brain desperately trying to come up with the next question in a vain attempt to keep the conversation flowing.  It's quite a sad spectacle to watch.  I'm sure people are relieved when I get up to get a drink or attend to some alleged 'urgent' incident in the kitchen.  Sometimes I just go to the toilet not because I have to, but just to get away.  Isn't that awful? Surely I have the makings of a sociopath.    This is why I like functions with a focus, rather than the aimless 'party' or 'get together'. This is why I love a quiz night, or a games night, or a poker game. You need a focus, something to get excited about. Competition does it for me. And if there's a reward involved, then even better!   And with that thought in mind, here comes the Christmas season! It's not as far as away as you think.
