It's my birthday tomorrow, and I think that suddenly I should be doing something about being single and 36.  Somehow, though, after spending the past ten minutes (and believe me, ten minutes is the absolute maximum amount of time I'm prepared to put any effort into remedying this situation) I've come to the conclusion that had it not been for some comments aimed at me in the past couple of days by well-meaning family and friends (well, I'm assuming they were well-meaning, come to think of it, I don't think they were well-meaning at all, but rather blunt and not a little mean) I'm thinking 'Fuck that shit'.  Honestly, I can't be bothered.  Is that bad? Why is that bad?  It's not as if I've had any fantastic role models for blissful relationships around me.   How could I, when just today, I had my mother moan to me about my father's perceived 'annoying' behaviour (Ma, I love you, but it's been 45 years, he's NOT going to goddamn change NOW. It's not as this stuff is NEW!) and then in the same breath, without even blinking, say 'You really need to find someone and get married''?What the?  The whole thing makes me cranky.  Huh, 'what's new', you might say?  I don't understand why it bothers people so much, this single-dom. I wonder if they think it's catching, like some creepy disease which will render everyone alone, a little bit crazy, and wanting many, many cats as pets.  It's not as if I don't know the consequences of being by myself forever.  I'll just get myself one of the groovy alarm things to hang around my neck, you know, those big alert necklaces that look like the clocks that Flavor Flav from Public Enemy wears.  I'll be hip when I break my hip! (ha!)  I know, ultimately, the people in my life want me to be 'happy', but clearly, they can't see the forest for the trees.    Oh, feel free to dismiss these ravings as cynical bitterness, but you know what? Tomorrow, I'm 36. I couldn't give a shit what you think.  :)
