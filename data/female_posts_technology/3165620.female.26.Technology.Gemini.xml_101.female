I did a mobius scarf (I still wear it in winter)and a klein bottle hat (rather pathetic looking, unlike his) before he ever learned to knit, but now he has far surpassed me in the geek knitting department. He has knitted a really freaky projective plane hat! I'm going to have to try that one out, myself.
