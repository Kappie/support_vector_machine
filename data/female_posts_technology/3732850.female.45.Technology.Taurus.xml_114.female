His idea is when do we retaliate and what does it take for us not to retaliate? I think that retaliation is something we all fight as a silent battle within each and all of us. I know I do. I am made fun of, talked about at worked, teased, and meant to feel bad. This man feels the same way because of his color. He is proud of being black but everyone else is scared because of his color. People are afraid of the unknown. This man was the stronger man because he didn't fight back the first time but when he fought back the second time he felt ashamed because he had let the monster fighting inside out to show his true feelings of what he feels about people who retaliate against black people just because they are black.
