Two days worth because, again, I'm playing catch-up...  Remember the things the Bible teaches and the things God wants of you. Put them into action and he'll reward you with a long and prosperous life.  Keep love and faithfulness to God close to your heart so you don't forget them or God and can keep him a priority in your life.  Trust God, his promises, and his teaching -- don't rely on your own worldview or beliefs or understanding of life, rely on what you know from what the Bible says.  That way you can stay on the right path, and that too will give you a long, healthy, and prosperous life.  Honor God, live the life he wants you to live, and you'll receive blessings beyond measure.  If you start to have bad times, don't show resentment toward God.  He might be trying to teach you something, but it's being done with love, the way a parent loves a child.  If you can remember all this and have the wisdom and understanding of God's teaching, you'll have a long, prosperous, and blessed life.  Part of this reminds me of what you hear all the time about people who go out of their way to help other people.  People who always give of themselves, who everyone knows they can count on and trust to come through.  Those people always seem to be the most loved, and when they have hard times and need people to come through for them, the response is overwhelming.  I think that's part of what these passages are saying.  Do what God wants you to do, stay on the right path, show love to him and to other people, and the reward -- either from God or from those around you (which is also from God, really) is going to be more than you could imagine.
