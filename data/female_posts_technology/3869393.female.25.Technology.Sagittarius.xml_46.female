Well, no choice really, need to visit the doctor today and check out whats really wrong with me.  I have this fear which is growing in me, dont know really how to put it.  Did a round of checkups yday, and was quite weird, well..hopefully I will get some answers today.  Need to run thro' the usual bunch of tests...dont even like the thought that I need to give blood....hate the sight of it..and the sight of needles, man, thats enough to freak me out completely!!!  Just hope this entire thing just blows over really fast, and I am perfectly back to normal health soon...dont want to look like a zombie on the move!
