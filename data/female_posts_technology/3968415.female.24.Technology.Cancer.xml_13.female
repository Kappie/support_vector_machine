It was a pretty small wound, so after the bleeding stopped, i kinda ignored it.  Nonetheless, the area around the wound became a little red and puffy on Fri. And at the back of my mind, i was thinking about the possibility of infection and even worse, tentanus.  Did some reading up on tentanus, ====One of the questions=====  Was the cut or puncture from dirty or contaminated objects, such as rusty nails or objects in the soil or did a puncture go through a shoe, especially a rubber-soled one? (Note: you will need a tentanus shot if you have not had one within 5 years (for a major wound) or if you had not had one in the last 10 years (for a minor wound).) If yes to one of these symptoms described above, please see your doctor. ======================  Was feeling ok till abt 9+ pm at nite, when i started feeling weak and a little feverish. I mean a lot of thoughts were running through my mind.  Will the doctor laugh at me cos the wound is so small? Am i over-reacting? Am i jus sleepy? Will it be too late if i dun do something abt it soon?  In the end, i decided to pop over to the docs anyway. Afterall, better be safe then very sorry.    ~jab~     *ouch* and no.. the doc didnt laugh at me
