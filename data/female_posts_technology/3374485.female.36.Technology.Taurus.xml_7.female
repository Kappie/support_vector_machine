After breaking two windows and belting the door with a piece of 2 x 4. Now I believe in instinct - when I parked (right round the corner in a dark side street well away from my street)I thought, don't park here - something will happen. But I parked anyway, ignoring myself. And look what happened. Mr Sam and I managed to replace the windows ourselves (Â£15 from a scrapyard owned by Mr next door but one - great neighbours!)but I now propose death by beheading for car vandals. SLOW beheading. With a blunt knife.
