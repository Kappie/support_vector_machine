Last night I tackled the pies.  I've never made a pie before so I wasn't exactly sure what to do.  But I followed the directions in the cookbook for apple pie and it seemed to work out ok.  I was surprised at how little actually goes into a pie crust, only flour, salt, shortening and water.  That's it. So I mixed and rolled my crust according to the recipes suggestions.  Now I just hope for the best.  I'm hoping my crust will be flaky and not hard or dry, or soggy.  We'll see when I bake it I guess :)    The pumpkin pie was easy.  I bought the crust and all you have to do is mix everything together, dump it in and bake it.  Couldn't be much easier than that.  Baking is fun, tonight I'll mix up the dough for the rolls and set it to rising.
