As I began the quest for the same, I was remembered of my days at my previous office. Those days when I used to sit for hours together and work with him and set up the intranet and then the online survey system. Cant forget the day when we founda bug and spent over 3 hours trying to find the error..gave up and later I found out that we had made an error in the setup. Quite a funny error which we made, but then the final product was a major success. Something I guess my previous office is now utilizing to the maximum ( thats ofcourse if they have the brains to understand its purpose...).   Anyway...so began my quest to figure out a survey program today. Sat for 2 hours this morning, couldnt find a single program to meet my expectations...guess I had too high ones coz of the last one which I set up at my previous office...no Idea. During the process I bumped into the software in PhP ESP easy software. Man, all the work which we did in setting this up, the ridiculous statements ppl made when we ventured out on this, etc...man, what memories. Had a look at the demo and thought how nice it would have been had I got some idea as to how to set this thing up. No one around here understands the meaning of PHP itself...quite sad...but then I guess thats something one will need to live with here. As I sat going thro the demo, all I could see was the work we did to fix the survey, get this moving...and there I lost all hope of figuring out how to install this....Man, I would need to learn PHP itself to figure this one out...  So I guess my search for another software for survey management will now begin again....wonder if there would be anything to meet my expectations....????
