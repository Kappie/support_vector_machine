A few tears, but no drowning, no flailing, no embarrassing moments (besides the crying in front of strangers thing... ugh) -- and except for when it was all over and it seemed half the church was commenting on how terrified I looked.  I'm just glad it's done and went better than I expected.  Thank God for Bobby bringing me to the pool to practice yesterday!  If not for that, things most definitely would not have gone smoothly.  In fact, they wouldn't have gone at all.  I wouldn't have been able to do it.   urlLink Bible Gateway : MATT 7, 1-5 :   1 "Do not judge, or you too will be judged. 2 For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you. 3 Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? 4 How can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? 5 You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye."   Fairly obvious, this one.  Don't be a hypocrite and go around judging other people unless you're perfect yourself.  However you judge someone, you're going to be judged in the same way, and with the same harshness, yourself.  If you have things you need to change about yourself, your own sins, shortcomings, etc., don't go judging other people about theirs unless and until you've taken care of your own.  I think I'm doing a lot better with this, actually, and trying to be less judgmental about people.  I especially never want to come off as holier-than-thou, so I think I'm really trying hard to keep my own issues in mind before I jump on someone else's.  I'm not perfect, but I do think I'm getting better, so... that's a good thing I guess.
