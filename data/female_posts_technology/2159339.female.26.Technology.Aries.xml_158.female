I've been trying to slowly ease myself into it by having a cup once in a while at home when Batty makes it. But this shit's strong and I drank a lot. I feel funny. I want to jump out of the 17th story with my umbrella because I'm sure I will land safely. I told one of the managers about my coffee binge and he said he'll check up on me in an hour. Good, I thought he was mad at me after I made fun of his outfit last Friday. There are tingles that keep going up and down my spine. ANd my legs feel hot.   Oh. Typing is more fun on coffee. O..  I'm going kayaking/camping this weekend. It's just going to be me and M since no one else can afford it/wants to go. It will be our version of Survivor, I told him last night: only one of us will come back alive and it won't be him.   Lunch in 10 minutes with bosslady. Please god don't let me make an ass of out myself as I suspect I will.   Oh. Shakey. I'm shakey. Will drink water now.
