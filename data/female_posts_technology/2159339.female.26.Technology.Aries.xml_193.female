Hot tears over crumply mouth, lump in throat, and immediate clogged nose will not get me any dates anytime soon. I don't care. Then when Mr.Hottie, my confidante, asked me casually how I was doing, I burst into tears in his office. He offered me a tissue and I had a therapy flashback. I'm a mess.   I have also turned into a psychotic. I saw Fucko leaving the building so I went upstairs to a secret room on the 3rd floor to watch him pull out of the parking lot. It was a nice day so he had his window rolled down and he was tapping his hand along to the music. Then I saw him check his phone. What does this mean? He's happy-go-lucky and carefree. He's waiting for some new girl to call him and be wonderful to him without the neuroses. I don't know. What I do know is that I felt so pathetic standing there in the secret room, my heart pounding, and more tears coming on. I just wanted to see him. So I saw him. But at what price? I'm now, officially, a creepy stalker.
