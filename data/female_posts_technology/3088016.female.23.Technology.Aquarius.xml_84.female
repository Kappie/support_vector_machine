Still, the lack of chewing power meant that even if my diet wasn't restricted to soft foods, I had to practice automatic portion control because it takes me so long to eat.  Even though it's had results for me, I wouldn't recommend the Wisdom Tooth Diet to anyone.  It's very expensive.   This week, I'm actually going to start light exercise again (walking, Yoga, elliptical) and deliberately watch what I eat.  It would be nice to keep up the results.  The funny thing about the nine pounds is that I don't notice it very much.  That's strange, because I'm petite to begin with and nine pounds is a notable portion of my body weight.  That worries me that it's going to bounce back, so I'll have to try extra hard to keep going in the right direction.  The  urlLink Slim-Fast  shakes have helped while I was out from surgery, because of their convenience.  Thankfully, I'm starting to like them.
