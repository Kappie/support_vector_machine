She sits next to the window with the blinds down.  I can see the outline of buildings.  It's 5:35 pm and the sky is dark.  On my left is a silver Verbatim cd copy of the album Bling Bling.  I burned a copy earlier at the request of Ms. J.  Under this are two more cds from CDR King containing recently burned copies of Smallville season 3 episode 4  5.  Under that is an envelope containing pictures of our October visit to Baguio.  My first time.  Before these are my Publishing Digital Video book, steno pad, Reader's Digest, Chinese in Three Months by Hugo, cellphone, tissue paper, scratch papers, three identification cards and a red pen.  Under these is a slip of paper with the meaning of ambiguous taped on the table.  Then there's my Alcatel phone logged on to 5508 and my big black bag which is, as usual, open.  On my right is a red thermos mug.  A gift from the boss last Christmas.  There are two plastic Nemo fishes in front of said mug.  One is Dory, the blue forgetful fish which they sometimes call me here and the yellow fish whose name I do not know.  I have two dead fishies on my desk.  They are here because I can't stand the sight and knowledge of them adding to the clutter at home.  Then there's my bear figurine where to my delight sometimes contains candy or chocolate courtesy of whoever is  galante  that day.  Mouse and StarFile where I keep some cds, other documents, Pentel pens and kikay kit.  Re-reading this I proceed to arrange my things into a semblance of order.  My eyes went to the fishies.  And away.  Can't decide what to do about them.
