Since last I saw her, a couple days ago, her face has become more gaunt and her breathing familiar. Familiar bad. Familiar in that  I've heard this breathing before  some months ago when my grandpa was dying. Heavy labored breathing followed by periods of no-breathing-at-all. And right when it's long enough and still enough for you to think, "Is this it?" you see a hand move and the breathing continues.  Afterwards we visited my aunt who is looking painfully thin. She was cheerful and even cracked a joke about death, much to the consternation of GreenM. It makes me sad to see my wonderful and kind aunt become weaker and more skeletal each time I visit. But she is so unselfishly generous that she makes light of things to keep visitors in good spirits. Even though she's in great pain, she makes jokes and talks about the future. Here's a bit of the conversation we had, last time I talked to her on the phone:  Aunt: So what are you going to do this summer? Me: I asked Mom to teach me how to cook Vietnamese food. I'm taking every other Wednesday off from work to go over to her house and  go grocery shopping. She's going to teach me how to buy food and cook it. I think it's time for me to learn. I don't know anything! I only know how to make fried rice. Aunt: (chuckling) Slow down! Slow down! I'll teach you how to cook. Listen, when I get better I'll teach you how to make  Canh Rau Day  and  Ca Gem !  Me: (voice cracking, swallowing lump in throat, faux-cheerily) Ok!  When I hung up the phone, I cried a little because I knew she wasn't going to get better and that she'd never teach me how to make my favorite meal. Then I got mad because why didn't she teach me these things when I was young and she was healthy? Why's she offering now when it's TOO LATE?? Then I got a little sad again. Then I felt okay.  So no Montreal for me. My mom says we'll have to postpone our trip together until things stabilize.
