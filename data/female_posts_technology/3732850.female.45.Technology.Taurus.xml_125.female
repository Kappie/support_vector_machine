I think there is one great part to this essay that describes this very well. “Even without respect to religion, the idea of suicide has been abhorrent throughout history. Some societies have imposed severe penalties on the families of suicides in the hope that the individual who sees no reason to continue his existence may be deterred by stigma his self-destruction would inflict on loved ones.” I feel this is the point that he wanted to get across.
