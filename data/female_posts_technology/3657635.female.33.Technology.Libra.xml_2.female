And why can anyone use a freakin turn signal when they're turning or changing lanes?  Ok I feel better now after getting that off my chest.  Today is Thursday and I hope it's better than yesterday.  Yesterday was good all except for the A/C flying out of our 3rd floor apartment window. It's now in A/C heaven if that's where they go after they commit suicide.  No one is to blame, except Chris thinks it's his fault.  The damn thing was missing the side skirt pieces and it wasn't really secure in the window, not to mention it didn't work half the time, always freezing up.  We're just glad the kid from the second floor wasn't outside playing....moral of the story screw the a/c to the window sill!
