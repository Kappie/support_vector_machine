I mean if u had slogged ur ass off for the last 2 years, happened to be damn unlucky to miss ur first pay increment in the 1st yr cos of wage freeze, and had delivered 2 succesful projects one after the other, you would think your bosses will reward you with a fat pay increment..    Noooooo.. it has to be a small little token of appreciation , 14%!!    i mean with such a small base pay.. any tiny amt will add up to 14%. Comeon! Who else you know is an IT professional takes home less than 2K! I am disgusted! And now with a 14% increment, it tips it slightly over 2K!    *gasp* thanks.  *rolls eye*
