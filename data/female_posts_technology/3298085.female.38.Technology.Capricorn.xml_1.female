I thhought I must've forgotten to take the med...boy was it bad. But I took a little more. It was like not being on any medicationexcept for the paranoia. It was bad. Abilify has the least side affects and the best outcome but I have side affects. I vomited some blood andmy stomach still hurts. I know it is probably an ulcer. I haven't seen anything on side effects yet...if ya'll see anything let me know. Side effects to me...these things just seem stronger-- Stomache hurts, sleep less..but it seems to suffice, eyes blur.. I mean really blur up. . panic attacks pretty regular... and really strong..I get real scared..like something isn't at least once every 2 days. BUT I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE WAY THIS DRUG HELPS ME. I feel "REAL" again. I don't feel like a whole other world is beating medown all the time. I don't have to protect everyone I love from the voices. Or the hateful, disgustiong, things they say.    I am so tired.... :) I worked 13 hours today. And closed the store on my first day. And I did it. Always knew I could work and be proudagain. Ya'll I won't ask Melvin to help me with money much unless I work.Good night.
