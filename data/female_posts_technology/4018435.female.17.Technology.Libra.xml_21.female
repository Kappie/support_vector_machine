I just hope Kevin cheers up for different reasons.         At first, the music was a bit bland and it wasn't loud enough. There were so many teeny boppers there I was kinda afraid hehe. All of them were short and hadn't hit puberty yet. Wow, I actually got to feel tall for a night! Yay!         Later on was a lot better. Amanda ended up dancing and getting to know a guy and I started to dance and talk to someone really cute. He seemed like such a sweet heart. I hope I get to talk to him again.            We had a hard time getting a hold of drinks before we went, so we ended up trying my mom and dads whisky. Oh...did that hurt...it was a hell of a lot stronger than i thought it was. I ended up stopping after a couple. Amanda kept going and Kevin downed some when we got home after dancing. We took pictures before and after we went and we caught a bunch of boring/weird things of us on video. Thanx for buying me a new tape for my camera Kevin!          Today I worked for a few hours and had some fun learning a thing or two about stuff I could do to get me bonus points as an employee. I'm really getting use to how long and how often I go to work now. In fact, even though I always knew i had a great job and loved it, now I can say I REALLY REALLY love it! There's something about it that I've gotten use to. I'm really feeling more comfortable being myself at work now. It's better than having panic attacks at my old job, that's for sure. The crazy thing about today? I went to work with abosolutely no make up! Funny, 2 years ago you would have had to hold me down with a couple wrestlers on each side of me to get me to wear make up. Nowadays, I'm your average girl putting on make on when i go out someplace. Of course I still refuse to wear mascara...           Well, I'm going to go sit outside in the warm sun right now. Maybe I'll draw or read while I'm out there. I wonder if I'll like this book that Heather's telling me to read. Hm...maybe I'll do  what I was doing earlier when I came home from work. Maybe I'll sit down in the back yard and take in the beauty around me :)                      Holding On, Moving On...  -The Lonewolf
