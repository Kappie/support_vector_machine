As far as I'm concerned, a great career move for Matthew Lillard would be decapitation.  Does anybody want to see Norm Macdonald in anything? At all? I'd like to see somebody toss him into the gorilla cage at the zoo and see how funny he can be. He screams "actor" with the same conviction with which Richard Simmons screams "straight."  It appears that James Van Der Beek has spent the post-Dawson's Creek years receiving electroshock therapy.  In "Mr. Wrong," director Nick Castle combines two things that don't go together: romantic comedy and an episode of Bugs Bunny. After directing this and the awful "Major Payne," I think Nick should be required to sit in on all the screenings of his next movie and take questions afterward, such as this one: "Can I beat the shit out of you in the parking lot, or should we get it over with here?"  Vertical Limit: . Climb, climb, climb, avalanche, climb, climb, Nitro-Glycerin explosion, climb, climb, awful dialogue, climb, climb, helicopter, climb, climb, cool action scenes that were shown to death in the previews, climb, climb, random death, climb, climb, credits. I just saved you 7 bucks.  I've always contended that Chris O'Donnell has the screen presence of a fried egg, and his performance here has done nothing to change my mind. Also on hand to humiliate himself is the formerly reliable actor Scott Glenn, who plays a gruff old mountain man looks like he's made of burlap. But the true standout of the cast is Robin Tunney. If there is a more vacuous and vacant actress currently alive in this world, then I'm Fred Gwynne. From her roles in The Craft to End of Days to Supernova, she is consistently and irretrievably awful. In Vertical Limit, she plays a climbing expert (excuse me while I snort Pepsi out of my nose) who spends the entire movie literally freezing to death, and Tunney can't even blow a nasal snot bubble convincingly.  Whoever thought Matthew Lillard should do Shakespeare has severe brain lesions. Whoever thought Alicia Silverstone should sing on camera is on drugs I never knew existed.   I feel bad for Jean-Claude Van Damme's proctologist. If his acting is any indication, it must take a lot of time and several hydraulic tools to get that guy's ass cheeks to separate. He walks around like he's some kind of frozen treat: Jean-Claude on a stick. You could sharpen a pencil if you got close enough to jam one into his rear end. The only thing stiffer than the guy's strut is his personality, which has all the flexibility of Margaret Thatcher at a rave after five double espressos.  This film is so bad that it actually casts doubt on the significance of Dylan's music career, because anybody whose soul is full of this much pretentious bullshit would barely be able to hold his own in a karaoke bar. If you didn't know that Dylan was more full of himself than a naked Tommy Lee on a heroin binge, you're about to learn.  Now, I don't know if they were paying Isabella Miko by the word or what, but all she does is scream and run around topless at the slightest provocation. I'm not sure this qualifies as acting so much as appropriate Hollywood party behavior, which may explain how Isabella got discovered.  Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy have better chemistry than Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Besides, Zeta-Jones could give Melanie Griffith a run for the "Please Stop Acting Before I Choke on My Own Tongue" award. She plays the part like a 15-year-old who's just learned she isn't getting the Beemer for her sixteenth birthday.  I'm going to find Ted Danson and kick his ass for not beaning Shelly Long with a shot glass during "Cheers" and eliminating that particular Hollywood plague at the source. The fact that the film studios haven't figured out yet that Shelly Long shouldn't be allowed in any more motion pictures is reason enough to hope for a massive earthquake that sends Hollywood to the bottom of the ocean floor.  The Corporation seems like the brainchild of 3 movie execs who aim to conceive a movie while completely high on marijuana. How’s THIS for a recipe? ”We take The Firm, that Cruise flick that’s ripped off more often than a hotel bathrobe, mix it with something old like The Stepford Wives, throw in a few pointless sex scenes, hire one of those 90210 freaks, and get Roger Corman to sign the check! Andrew Stevens will direct. He’d direct rush hour traffic for two donuts and cab fare. Oh, and call the Mom from ET. We need someone to overact and humiliate themselves badly.” ”Which 90210 kid? The short little Michael J. Fox clone, or the tall brooding James Dean wannabe?” ”No, I was thinking that bland lifeless blonde one! The one that’s NEVER BEEN IN A MOVIE before!” ”Ian Ziering???” Does he have an agent? Does he even have a phone?”  Speaking of stupid, has anyone else noticed that Tara Reid is so artificially tan that she looks like one of the Oompah-Loompahs from "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory." Her eyes appear so freakishly bright because of her unnatural skin tone that even when I close my eyes now, I can see the spots burned into my retinas.  The director of this movie is David Zucker, the guy who made "Airplane." It's hard to imagine what this guy has done to himself in the last couple of decades to become so unfunny, but my guess is that it probably involved Christian Science and LSD.  Here's the exact moment when I knew "Die Another Day," the 20th James Bond film, was going to get nuked: Madonna's cameo appearance. And it's not like the woman just walks across the screen and you say, "Oh look, its Madonna." No, she has a speaking part with actual full sentences. I don't know where the definition of "kiss of death" is in the Hollywood lexicon but "Madonna has a speaking part" is an indication that you're getting close. This woman couldn't be stiffer if she had an icicle in her rectum.   Sofia Coppola wrote and directed this film, which means twice the failure. Her direction reminded me of her acting in "Godfather 3," a performance that had every critic in America pondering whether she'd look better in a Burger King or a McDonald's uniform.   New tagline for marketing campaign: "Better than 'Gigli'!"  Forget the "Saturday Night Live" curse; how about the "Friends" curse? Death would seem a welcome release compared to a life of starring roles in such gems as "Ed", "The Pallbearer" and "Fools rush in." Memo to Matthew Perry (and all the "Friends" for that matter): more Vicadin, not less.   Putting Winona Ryder in an action thriller like "Alien" makes about as much sense as letting Marlon Brando lead a Jazzercise video. Her character is about as interesting as a pound of alien dung.  Never mind that casting Ben Affleck as a street tough and Jennifer Lopez as a lesbian stretches believability more than casting John Goodman as Peter Pan. Welcome to Hollywood and the Anne Heche-ization of lesbianism. Not only is lesbianism a transitory sexual preference, to be waved around like a Chanel purse, but it's also a great marketing tool!  I just can't emphasize enough how bad it all is. I mean, it's such a disaster it may resurrect Lawrence-Hilton Jacobs' career. He'll be able to defend himself by saying "at least I didn't make 'Battlefield Earth'," and executives will have to acknowledge that he has a point.   "Bad Boys 2" is a 150-minute life-sucking experience. It's like that scene in "The Princess Bride" where Prince Humperdink turns the machine up to "50" and sucks 50 years of Wesley's life away.   I don't know where anybody got the idea that Chris Rock could act, but the guy is making about as much progress in his new career as Corey Feldman is as a pop singer.   Since I can do no public service by discussing this film, I'd like to offer some guidelines for filmmakers who consider endeavors of this nature in the future.  1.	No more film adaptations of bad American sitcoms.  2.	Should, by some oversight, such a film adaptation be made, original cast members may not appear in them -- not even in a pathetic "hey look, that guy is still alive" cameo.  3.	If such a film lasts longer than 85 minutes, the filmmakers shall be considered to be in violation of the audience's basic human rights.  4.	Producers are prohibited from casting any of the following people in a speaking role: Tom Arnold, Jim Varney, Ed Begley, Jr., any current or former cast member from Saturday Night Live, any person who was part of the '80s Brat Pack, any member of the Sheen or Baldwin families, Fran Drescher, Florence Henderson and Shelly Long. Especially Shelly Long.  Any violation of above rules will result in the filmmaker's compulsory attendance at next year's Academy Awards ceremony, where he will have his head chopped off onstage in a gala musical tribute to mediocrity.
