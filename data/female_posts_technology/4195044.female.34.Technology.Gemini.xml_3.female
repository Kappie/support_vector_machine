Good riddance... at least for the time-being, hehe.    On to the OGRE...    I am seething in anger towards the ogre   urlLink Microsoft  ! My   urlLink HP   laptop is barely 2 weeks old and is already suffering from dementia -  Memory Dump . The processor can´t stop groaning forever, all because of the pathetic  Microsoft IE  eating up the system. I know it´s new, so it must have the bug crunch and even if you install the software patches... these updates by the way like a neverending cycle, produces new sets of bugs! Chicken and egg situation. I really don´t know what to do. Stayed up last night till 1:30AM fixing it, well Dutchman did it for me. Dutchman can´t even view the errors! We have done the  RESET  countless times, still it remains the same, unyielding. When he deleted the IE in the taskbar, the system quickly went back to normal. But what is a person without the soul? The hardware is nothing if there is no software!  Given the chance, I would kick Bill Gates´ass for monopolizing the desktop software consumer market. I hope tonight the laptop will do some miracles... if not, I am resigned to re-install that despicable  Microsoft XP Pro ! :-(
