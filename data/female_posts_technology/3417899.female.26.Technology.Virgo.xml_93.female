He recently returned from a long trip overseas, and was catching up with friends. He hasn't seen them in 4 months. It was a happy reunion. Noisy.   Then he receives the call. My grandfather is on the other side - out of breath, almost out of his mind, crying. He is feeling terrible, worse than he's ever felt - he says. He is dying. Please come. Fast. Fast. He is dying.   I can only imagine the next minutes. The good grandson dropping everything, dashing to the car. Speeding through stop lights, heart beating fast, hands shaking. Bursts into the small apartment, runs into the bedroom.   My grandfather is sitting in his bed. Still alive (well, as alive as he'd been for the last few years). He's had a nightmare.  He just had a nightmare.
