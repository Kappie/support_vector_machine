I mean, I quite like the music and all, but do they have to decimate the English language in the process?  I don't know, whatever happened to respecting grammar and the proper meaning of words.  Sometimes, I find myself saying 'what was that again?'.  Fortunately, I'm not interested in going to the particular establishments advertised on the dance music radio station, because I would totally turn up at the wrong place at the wrong time, because I didn't hear the details properly.   Also, those events seem to be at really inconvenient times, like 2am, which frankly, is ridiculous.  I've always said, I'd love to go to a rave, if only they were held at reasonable times, say 7pm - 10pm.   I feel that I'm falling into the cracks between being young and old.  Especially in terms of having any alliance to a radio station.  I'm finding this dilemma a little bit stressful.  It used to be that one radio station would serve all my needs for music and information, but lately, I find I'm becoming a bit of a radio station slut, flicking between all of the radio stations programmed  into my car radio, all in the space of a 20 minute drive to work.  I think it depends on my mood, although I have found a number of times saying to myself ; 'Golly, what is this noise? I don't understand young people's music!'   And what's even sadder is that even if there is a song I particularly like on any given station, if it's anywhere near the hour, I will immediately feel the need to flick over to the station with the news on, in case I miss anything of great importance.  I'm turning into my Dad, who has to watch all the news bulletins on television every night.  Although disparaged by my mother at one point, who said 'You watch all that news and you still don't know anything'.   Oh well, until someone comes up with a fabulous radio station which plays a mixture of new stuff, old-ish stuff, sing-a-long stuff and a comprehensive current-affairs and news service without any commercials - but only at the times I feel like it, I'll be flicking the dial like a woman possessed.  Sometimes, being in your mid 30s sucks.
