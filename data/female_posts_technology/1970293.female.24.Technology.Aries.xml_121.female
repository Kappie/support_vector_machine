She only hoped no one would realize the girl also had red hair. Red hair is a banner for her family. An unwelcome banner that told all the heritage of her family. Witches. Each and every woman born with red hair and green eyes within her family was a witch. Fortunately there was never more than three or four women alive at one time. They learned to hide it well throughout the decades.   Morrigan, her mother named her for better or worse for that was the name of the goddess of battle. Battle may be what she has to learn to prepare for in the future. No doubt that one day someone will find out that she is a witch and she must be able to withstand the ridicule and hardship ahead.   Luckily her mother was also a witch with red hair and green eyes. Of course her mother taught her everything that she learned from her aunt many years ago. Her family has very old roots that go to the beginning of the new country traced even further back to the old country.  "Witch." The whispers of the town folk behind and even in front of their faces hurt them for they would never mean any harm though there was that aunt whocursed a woman for starting the rumors. But that of course is theexception or is it.Morrigan thought asshe pretended to read a book at the table.   She didn't go tothe school house like the other children.She stayed home to learn the basic subjects as well as wiccan ones. She sighed. Sometimes it was neat to realize what kind of powers she had and then it was horrible to think of how she will be treated for the rest of her life. She wondered how she would have babies of her own.
