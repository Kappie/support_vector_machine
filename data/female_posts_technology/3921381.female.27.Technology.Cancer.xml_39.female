I feel different now.   perhaps the second month, i saw this white figure coming out of the garage as we were coming home. I thought it was my husband and I said something to it. It took maybe 2 seconds for me to realize it wasn't him. But I wasn't scared. Felt like it was watching over our house or us. From that point on, i believe if you saw something at the corner of your eye, you did see something.  Now its different. now i feel something. nothing evil.. i hope. yesterday i thought i saw something and i'm afraid i did.   Why do they hide under the bed or in the closets or in dark places? My sister in law has the gift to see ghosts. She says they sometimes test her to see if she sees them. They would sneak up on her and see if she reacted. Spooky.   She says everything in The Sixth Sense is true. Scary shit, if you ask me.
