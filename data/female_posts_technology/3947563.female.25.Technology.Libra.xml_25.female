So, I've done fairly well... nutrishakes for breakfast both days, tuna and crackers for lunch with a diet pop (cheap AND low in calories/fat), and a low-calorie salad for dinner (w/ grilled chicken on Monday, baked sole last night).   I was having a sweet craving like you would not believe last night, so I made myself a poor man's cheesecake - nuked some frozen raspberries with a few ounces of cream cheese, topped with sweetner and a couple of tbsp of crush cornflakes. Pretty tasty, if I do say so myself, high protein and fibre, too.   I went for a 20 minute walk on Monday night while the hubby was umpiring a baseball game and did 20 minutes of weight lifting last night. Plus 10 minutes of stretching each night and I remembered to take a multivitamin each morning. So far, I'm on track.   HOWEVER, Heather brought her scale in this morning and I weighted myself.. holy schamoley, I'm up to 250! ARGH! Heather, like a true friend, stuttered out something about the scale not being accurate, but I have to admit, I'm not feeling good bout this. Talk about a little bit of motivation. Hopefully, by this time next week, I can weight myself again and see some improvement.
