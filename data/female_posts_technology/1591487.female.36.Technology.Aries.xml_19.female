I almost contemplated driving straight past work this morning and heading onto the Barossa for a lovely lunch in the sun.  It was very tempting, I can tell you.  I'm thinking Christmas, I'm thinking gifts, baking, card-making. I'm thinking - panic.   I think it all started with the David Jones hamper catalogue I've been flicking through. Damn David Jones and it's whole 'Get organised for Christmas early' philosophy.  Christmas 2003 will not consist of icing biscuits until 2am in the morning, wrapping gifts with birthday paper and writing out cards but actually forgetting to give them to people.  By Martha, I will be organised this Christmas!  Although I feel slightly resentful that such a western construct as 'Commercial Christmas' has made me feel this way, even though I know that Christmas is about none of those things ie. biscuits, cards, hampers and that it's fashionable to denigrate any activity associated with 'Commercial Christmas' however,  it is the only time I feel that the excessive use and consumption of fat and sugar in my delicious biscuits is justified.    On a completely different note.	  My new favourite reality TV show is the  urlLink Iron Chef  on SBS.  Those wacky Japanese, such a wonderful healthy respect for the art of preparation and consumption of food.  Apart from that the incomparable English 'commentary' over the top of the real Japanese is rather hilarious and not a little surreal as it's not just plain interpreting but real 'interpreting' ie. acting.  The only negative thing after watching the show is having an enormous hankering for Asian food of any sort, rather than the half a packet of rice crackers I did have which just didn't cut it.
