I've told the story often on this dude but had never actually taken the time to actually read about him.        What the article doesn't tell you is the really fun stuff.  Yeah, he's an English teach in Limerick, but according to one of my flatmates from Trinity College, he also  talks to the faeries in the middle of class !  She would tell me stories about how he would stop in the middle of a lecture and look around frantically and start talking to the faeries that only he could see.        When there was a proposal by the Irish government to join the EU, the one stipulation was that they work on the roads in Ireland to facilitate trade and travel (and if you've ever been on the Irish roads, you know it's needed).  The road was supposed to be widened between Ennis and another town, but a hawthorn bush was marked for destruction.  Eddie stepped in because it was the metting place for two tribes of faeries, and if it was destroyed the faeries would die out because they tribes couldn't meet up before they went into battle together, and it was also dangerous to anyone who would be driving on the roads because the faeries were likely to attack.  Eddie started a campaign, went to the government, and the road was  rerouted  to save the bush.  Ireland is truly the only country I know to stop progress in the name of magic.  But the story does have a somewhat tragic epilogue, and  urlLink here it is (from Eddie's own website).
