It was one of those evenings I wish I could rewind so that instead of going out, drinkingand saying lots of dumb shit, Iwould insteadjust go to my room and clean and pay bills and feel like a responsible adult. I have gotten better at sensoring the random offensive comments that come out of my mouth, but I still have nights like this when I'm having too much fun to care and then I regret it. We went to get Naan 'n Curry on O'Farrell and the whole time Ipoked my fork into the common biryani plate and pick out all the cauliflower because I love it so much and shoveled it into my mouth. I was aware of what I was doing but did it anyway because food overrides my common sense and my desire to act civilized.   Does anyone want two pittbull puppies? Coco, the female, is photographed above (or is it the other one?). I'm helping this guy in my neighborhood get these sweet dogs adopted. They are 7 months old, have had all the shots, are fixed and even have that little chip installed in their leg. I've totally lagged on posting the ad on craigslist - he's probably wondering why noone has called. Resposibilities!! Need to focus on that. No more driving off for weekends or drinking every night.
