That is what I have been preaching to my daughter since she was little.  I have tried to enstill that in her -- sometimes, I think she hears me; sometimes, I think she doesn't; or, perhaps, she is choosing not to listen.  Whatever the case, I am hoping that she learns from her bad choices and thrives on the good choices.  I'll be the first to admit that I am not perfect by any means.  My daughter, at nearly 17 years old now, should be fully aware of that.  I have made no bones about it; however, I have continually moved on learning from those bad choices to get where I am today.  I choose to live for the moment and the future rather than dwelling upon what I have done wrong throughout my life.  If asked, I will gladly share my past with others so that they can learn; however, that is a far cry from dwelling upon it.  In fact, I have been asked to speak on behalf some non-profit organizations to share with others my history so that I could inspire others into knowing that there is hope for change to occur.  Today, from the small Church I attend here, the pianist there is celebrating her 96th Birthday.  Being that I am only 45 years old today, I know that I should have at least another 45 years to go, if not  much, much  more (my maternal Grandfather was 96 years old, my paternal Great-Grandmother was 98 years old, etc. when they died). Here is to hoping and praying that my next 45 plus years are less traumatic and more celebrating of life's good pleasures and moments! :)
