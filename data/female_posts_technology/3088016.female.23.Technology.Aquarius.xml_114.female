This weekend, Australia hosted the premier camel race, the  urlLink Camel Cup Carnival .  The Afghan ambassador to Australia even flew in for the event.    The last camel I saw was spitting all over the enclosure he was in.  He hardly seemed like a majestic animal to me.  I guess this is proof that if you can imagine it, then somebody is doing it.
