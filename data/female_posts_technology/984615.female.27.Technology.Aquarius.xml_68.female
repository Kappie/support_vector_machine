I'm not quite sure if that is good; having been told ad naseum that I MUST feel a sense of loss and greif for those who did suffer innocently at the hands of others.   And I do. However I am more scared that "we" collectively haven't learned from what has transpired. That scares me more than an angry group of terrorists who lash out because it they feel it is the ONLY way to make themselves heard.  And I am still as helpless as I was at 5:45 am PST 9/11/01.
