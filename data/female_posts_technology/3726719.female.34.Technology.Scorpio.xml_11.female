We did "the Walmart run" that happens for me every payday, rented some movies, got shrimp for dinner, and pina colada fixins at the liquor store.   Movies of choice were: Bad Santa (the Badder Santa unrated version), Rundown, and Along Came Polly. Let me just say that Bad Santa is a riot!!! I didn't make it through Rundown. It looked like it had potential, however after several pina colada's I was bored and couldn't focus. I ended up going out with a new friend and talking until like 2:00 in the morning. FYI - airport observation parking lot is just a cool place to hang out.   So Saturday comes along and I had a date to meet someone for coffee. Which I did. Nice enough guy. Turns out he's old enough to be my father!! :o) I've actually put him in e-mail contact with my mother. I think they might have a lot in common. We'll see.   After sitting and chatting for an hour or so, I was itching to be outside to do something. So I went back home and gathered up the roomie. We went to play putt putt. I won...Won't tell you by how much in order to protect the roomie's ego. Since he likes to play pool, and is not familiar with all the places to do that, we went and shot some pool. Okay, he shot pool and I learned how to at least hit the ball! :o) It was a lot of fun and something I see myself spending time doing....Like the batting cage and driving range thing. I'm really into this being active thing!   Turns out that while I was having coffee Saturday morning, the roomie got a call from his ex-girlfriend. Turns out she is getting married. So he was in a reflective, mostly venting mood on Saturday. Why indeed do people do that? Make that "I'm getting married" call to the former spouse or former girl/boy friend? Is it closure, revenge, or just FYI? The scary thing I realized while he was talking (venting) about things, is the similarities between his ex and me. The primary differences are big. There are just some underlying things that she and I appear to have in common. It must really freak him out sometimes. Anyway, after leaving the pool hall we headed back to the house to lounge on the couch and watch Along Came Polly. Cute movie.   While doing that, I ended up with a dinner date....After turning down a movie date. And here is where the entertaining portion of this post begins, because it turned into one of those dates from hell!!   I went to pick up my date, we'll call him Mr. C, because he had been drinking by the pool during the day. Here is where you should know that I thought this was just being responsible on his part. I didn't mind because I'd rather not risk the whole drunk driving thing. Anyway...So I went to pick up Mr. C at his new apartment. We chatted a bit, I checked out his new computer. Everything seemed fine, and I didn't notice any behavior outof the ordinary.We headed to the Green Hills Grille for dinner. Interesting note.....I'm wearing a red sweater, dressy black slacks, and high-heeled black sandals.......Mr. C is wearing khaki shorts, a golf shirt, and sports shoes. Always helpful to coordinate wardrobe before an outing. I felt over-dressed.   So we arrive at GHG and start the parking challenge. Parking is horrible of course, I don't want to have to pay the valet (and Mr. C didn't offer), so he suggests parking in a spot marked for another restaurant. I don't really like this idea, however I went along with it anyway. No sooner did we get inside GHZ and head for the bar than the valet dude at the other restaurant was tapping Mr. C on the shoulder to move his car. Well of course it's my car, so I have to go out and figure out where on God's green earth I'm going to park!   After finding a safe place (posted that parking is okay after 6pm) to park, I went back in and joined Mr. C at the bar for the martini I had requested. We chatted with a couple sitting next to us, and it looked like things would go well. We got seated at our table and were chatting away. At the moment I can't remember what about. It turned into a question of my interest/attraction for him. He admitted his attraction for me (several times). Before answering him, we placed our orders with the Jaime the waiter.   That's when the first ugh hit. I like to know the name of the person serving me food. It allows me to address them by name and just be polite. Mr. C is from Canada, so I don't know if that AND the alcohol impacted his statement to the waiter or not. All I remember is the statement "and don't make it cold because I'm a dick." Before this, Jaime was pleasant and smiling. After this Jaime could barely stand to be anywhere near our table.   So in wording my response to Mr. C, I told him I thought he could be interesting, I thought he was slightly attractive, and that it was too early for me to form an opinion one way or another about any kind of emotional attachment or desire to jump into the sack. I did tell him that I was turned off by the intoxication. See, after sitting down at the table (I sat across from him), it became clear to me that he could barely keep his eyes open. He was practically having to hold himself up. He had ordered us both a martini at the bar, and I'll admit to having concerns about him ordering himself another one. And when I mentioned it, he did say that he had put on his profile "drinks excessively." Oh lord.   And there I sat, trying to keep myself entertained, and him talking so he wouldn't pass out. A family was seated next to us, at a rather close proximity I must say, and I was mortified at his language. The young daughter was practically sitting at our table and Mr. C had no problem letting slip words and topics that were not appropriate. And of course I asked him to watch his language out of courtesy, and what does he do? Get short with me for treating him like an imbecile when I said "please, please." Oh, and then he makes the statement that I look "deliciously beautiful" and returned to talking about 2 previous relationships that ended with the women telling him he was a jerk (hmmmm.....Wonder why). In the midst of that part of the discussion, he mentioned that the only thing keeping him from dating me seriously was the fact that he was still in love with one of those women!! :)) LOL...LOL....LOL   All I can think to myself at this point is, please God get me out of here. So I start Mr. C talking about his family. Oh God - what a mistake. He got on the topic of his sisters not speaking to him. And he doesn't understand why. Brace yourself for this.....He started crying. Yep, all broken up over the sisters not talking to him, determined it must be because they don't like men and he's a man, and he teared up and cried. At this point I'm thinking he needs to check out AA and a really good therapist, because at 42 I'm thinking he should have worked through this stuff by now (I know, I'm harsh).   He finally paid the check...That the waiter had left sitting on the edge of the table like 20 minutes prior....And we left. The brainless twit had the audacity to start rubbing his hand up my thigh as we were driving down the road!!!! I told him I would rather he didn't do that. I thought we were going for coffee, and mentioned Starbucks which we had to pass on the way back to his house. He said he really didn't drink coffee, said he didn't think this was working out, and suggested I take him home. I did not have a problem with that and was immensely relieved when he got out of the car!!   Lucky for me, not so lucky for the roommate, he was home when I got back to the house. I got a hug of comfort for a horrible date, he got entertained by a bad date story, and then I practically begged him to go out and do something with me. I mean he WAS still mopey from the whole ex-girlfriend phone call thing (he ended up calling and leaving her a message that he was happy for her yada yada yada). So he got ready and we went to Silverado's. Yes, it is the most redneck place to be in the city of Nashville on a Saturday night. The music is loud and the dancing is cool. Oh, and they have really cheap beer prices until11.   So we hit the bar to grab a drink and then parked it along the dance floor rail to watch the crowd. I SO want to learn the country dances!! It looked so much fun. I'm scoping out dance lessons in the area because of that. The hip-hop/rock music started up around 11:30. Sweet roomie was awesome and hit the dance floor with me for Yeah by Usher!! When the classic Push It started we took a breather. While waiting at the bar for tequila shots, one of roomie's favorite songs started, so we went out and danced a slow number (he only stepped on my foot once). :o)   A couple dances and a couple tequila shots later, we hit the pool tables. We got in a couple games before roomie had one last beer and we headed for home. Of course, he was still nursing the ex girlfriend call, so we went by Krogers for comfort food.....shrimp, pina colada mix, and Ben  Jerry's.....all of which were finished off (okay not the pina colada mix) while we vegged on the couch and watched Animal House (okay we flipped back and forth between that and Terminator).   Roomie was good and passed out by 2. I was a little antsy, so got online to check e-mail. Had an IM from Mr. C letting me know that I had looked beautiful and he hoped I would find what I was looking for and started chatting with the friend I went out with Friday night...we'll call him Mr. R. Mr. R is just a cool guy and was amused by my bad date story. He ended up coming over and hanging out for a few hours.   Needless to say I didn't get much sleep Saturday night/Sunday morning. I think R left around 6, and I was back up and drinking coffee at 10. I helped the roomie work on some budget stuff, and then we went to Brad  Dena's to grill out. Brad rocks doing steaks on the grill. With baked potatoes and grilled corn on the cob, it was an excellent meal. Before dinner we hung out and were entertained by young master Brandon and the sweet miss Autumn. I whipped up on Dena and the roomie while playing Uno!!! Oh, and the roomie discovered a great appreciation for watching Disney movies from recliner.   And if he's willing to wait about 12 years, the roomie has a ready made bade in Autumn. She hugged on him all through dinner and afterwards. It was too cute.   So, needless to say it was a very full weekend. Which probably complicated this morning. I set the alarm last night, just didn't turn it on. Boy was I snoozing good when the roomie woke up around 8 and started making noise. There's nothing like starting the day yelling a full-throated F*!! Amazingly enough, I made it to work by 8:45 and made my 9 a.m. meeting. And some how I've managed to stay awake during the day, though I will admit that my work accomplishments leave a little to be desired. Hey, at least I voted and provided the world with an interesting blog entry!!   Happy Monday everyone!
