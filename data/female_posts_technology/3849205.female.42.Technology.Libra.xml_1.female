I think there is going to be lots of water. Its supposed to be over 100 for the next 3 days.   I think I will prolly have a salad for lunch and one for dinner. Im not used to that much salad, but I know its good for me. I am going to have to get some more tomatoes and shrimp.   I just really want to post some feelings Im having....Im afraid...I feel like if I dont get rid of this weight I am going to die. I am so inactive and that just has to change. I am trying to work outside more and make herbal beds which is active. I am really going to work on this issue. Im also afraid of failing. There is no denying it...I love sweets and I love carbs. I will sit and eat when I am not even hungry. I have to come to terms with this too. It all has to end. I want to eat when I am hungry and eat things that are good for me.   Its now 10:30pm and I so want to eat. I have made up my mind though that I am just not going to eat after 7pm. I also got a very large water mug tonight that I think holds like half a gallon. I will drink two of those a day.
