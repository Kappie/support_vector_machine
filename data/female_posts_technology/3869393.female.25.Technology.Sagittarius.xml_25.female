We tend to take our blessings for granted, like the story about a homeowner who hired a real-estate agent to prepare an ad to sell his home.   The homeowner was reading the ad in the paper about his home's many attractive features.  He called the real-estate agent to say he no longer wished to sell. When asked what changed his mind, the homeowner said, "After reading your ad, I realized I already live in the house I always wanted to live in."  I guess most people understand the value of others only after they lose or almost lose what means the most to them! The difference in life is made when one decides to hold on to something which means the world to them , fight it out and not be held back by one's ego! It takes a lifetime to get over stuff when you lose something so dear to your heart!
