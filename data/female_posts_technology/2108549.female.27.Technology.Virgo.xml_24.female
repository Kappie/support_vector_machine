Turns out through a snafu on their part, I haven't been insured the last week and a half.  3 hours later it got straightened out but sheesh  its been a while since I have been  that  frustrated. I also talked to M.A. who saw the post on my entry about the painting.  His mother in law is on the arts council and she got him a phone conference with Robert Watson.  I'll have a lithograph of my painting in 7 weeks!  I am way excited.  I can't wait!  That painting did something to me.  And now... I'll get to see it every day!!!!    I also got a call for a job.  I'd be doing tech support for AAA's call center employees.  I go talk to the contract guy tomorrow.  I'm not supposed to go back to work yet but.... in this job market, I can't turn it down if the money is right.  Its temp to perm with a 3 month commitment.  I'll get the work hours and pay scale tomorrow I guess.    All good stuff but definitely not any of what I thought would happen when I opened my eyes this morning!
