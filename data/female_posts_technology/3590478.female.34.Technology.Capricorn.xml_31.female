Wankers, this is pure evil you're dealing with and we are not impressed. (That's right, the royal we.) My advice to you is to watch your back and no matter what anyone says to you, mock. The bigger the mocking  the better. Example: A coworker tells you your car is being towed. Your response should be, "Yeah, I saw that going on when I was in the back seat of  your car  having sex with  your mother . I wasn't terribly concerned you know, because the sex with your mom and all." Or "You need to get those spreadsheets down to accounting before the afternoon meeting."  Your response should be, "Accounting just called. That meeting was cancelled because they're having a funds drive to raise the money for your frontal lobotomy and sex change combo operation. Aren't they a bunch of swell squares?" If anything happens to be true you can always apologize later and explain that you thought it was an April 1st prank. Then do that thing Pinky Tuscadero used to do on happy days.  Now for your amusement I have some prank stories. If you find them offensive know that I chose some mild ones and, Um, be glad. You puny humans couldn't comprehend the truly evil ones. And if you find them evil? Well, "it's obvious day at camp stupid." 1.) In high school my very favorite coconspirator (god he was truly, brilliantly evil) and I were suspected of some crime and were assigned to pep squad trash duty. (They had to start punishing us for suspicions because they could never pin anything on us and pep squad trash duty means we had to pick up trash behind the bleachers after football games. And I think that particular crime was that "somebody" dumped all the PE balls into the creek behind the sports fields. Dodge, volley, tennis, foot, etc. ALL of them.) So while on trash duty we came across a dead pigeon and realized immediately what had to be done. We stuffed it into a McDonalds' sack and hid it behind some never checked out books in the library. (I should explain that the head librarian was not in any way like Rupert Giles and was in every way like a nazi crossed with the grandmother from flowers in the attic. And also she was our arch nemesis.)  Then we sat back and waited. After about two weeks even the teachers were avoiding the place. It was pure luck that arch nemesis was the one who found our treat. Then she took a much-needed 3-day rest. 2.) Arch nemesis story number 2. Natural gas had just come to my hometown and the gas company decided they needed to give a lecture to the high school students in an assembly because, you know, 16 year olds give a rats ass about natural gas. Included in the lecture was a small pamphlet with a scratch and sniff spot which was even less interesting than the assembly. (Unless you were evil) Coconspirator procured a case of the pamphlets and over the next few weeks we would drop a few each day down into the heater boxes in the library. Once we had every pamphlet from that case stuffed into the heaters we sat back and waited.  For winter . You don't have to actually scratch the spot to get a sniff, all you have to do is heat it up a bit. We all know natural gas has no smell, that's why they add the yucky scent. So, imagine 3000 spots of the stuff being heated up all at once. Mayhem ensued and arch nemesis took yet another much-needed 3-day rest.  I was also going to tell you about the prank I pulled on the nerds when I belonged to the live action role playing society and the one I pulled on my sister while she was on her honeymoon but I'm sure you've all lost interest at this point and it's already too long.  Signed, your evil fool Valerie
