In the five seconds or so that it takes to open the email, all kinds of situations are running through my head.  Maybe Opa is in the hospital...he can't have passed away, mom would have called...maybe its Grandpa or Grandma...I hope Ryan and Caitlin are ok...maybe something happened to dad at work...  When the email finally opened (felt like an eternity) I quickly scanned the contents and saw (to my relief) that no family members were sick or injured.  Rather Caitlin was informing me that Pam, our cat and the mother of the cute little kittens, had been hit by a car.  Poor Pam.  She was a nice kitty.  But I was so relieved that everyone is ok.  Moral of the story?  Don't label your email messages "bad news", its just too hard on the recipient's heart.
