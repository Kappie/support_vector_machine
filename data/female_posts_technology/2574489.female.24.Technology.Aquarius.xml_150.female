Since I am not really politically-minded, I don't usually discuss US politics on my blog. If you'd like more than just food-talk, book-talk, and girl-talk to churn your "little grey cells", then follow the link and voice an opinion.   Here's something new about me: I am a sucker for debates. I don't necessarily want to get in the middle of one, but reading or watching a good debate where the debaters are well-informed and particularly eloquent is something I enjoy very much.
