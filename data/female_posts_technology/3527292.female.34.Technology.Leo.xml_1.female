I feel better now that I have an updated resume and cover letter, but still have a constant nagging stomach/head ache... it only gets worse if I think about it.  I need a job.. and quick... but this situation really makes me question my skills.  My brothers says I'm a real tech nerd because I have a blog.  People don't realize how easy some of this stuff is... i guess i don't either.  Leaving work a little early today... need to get jr's hair cut and shop for b-day and grad gifts.  Having dinner tonight with the StonyBrook clan at Olive Garden... sinfully good cliche restaurant.... yummmm
