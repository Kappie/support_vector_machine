He pretended to own a hotel so that he would look like he can afford 50 grand  for their wedding.  After his girlfriend's urging, he took the blind stepdaughter to work in the hotel as a masseuse.    This is not a and-they-live-happily-ever-after kind of movie.  It is sweet and real.  The ending is open-ended, but one that I don't mind.  It is enough.  You tend to dwell on the happy times that they spent together. =)  Directed by Zhang Yimou and stars Zhao Benshan, Dong Jie, Dong Lihua, Fu Biao among others.
