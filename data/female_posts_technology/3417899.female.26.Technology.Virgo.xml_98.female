       
        Now I know how the river feels, when it reaches the sea It finally finds the place it was always meant to be Holding fast, home at last, knowing the journey is through,  Lying here with you - I know how the river feels...   The night has slowly rolled in, these lyrics play sweetly  and I cautiously allow myself to drift... To float to safety...
