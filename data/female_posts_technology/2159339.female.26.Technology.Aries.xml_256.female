I'm not one to blame PMS, so I've determined that it must be due to very specific reasons, which are: 1)me being tired all the time 2)M's ability to create drama though he's not even here 3) mom's reminders of what a good gramma she would be if given the chance 4) not being able to see the people I love (G, Roomies, Fellow Show Hoes, Camp Peeps) enough to balance out having to see the people I don't like (people at work, everyone else) 5)hating my job at least 5 hours a day.   New things are starting to piss me off that I've been able to ignore in the past - my cube neighbor's loud crow-like cackles, the constant interuptions made by the dumb girl in french class, the smell of the man on the bus, waiting for the elevator at my building. I know that life is cyclical and I can't always be jumping for joy, but I kinda want to snap out of it. On the bright side, my bitchiness has made me more assertive and direct. When I ask for things at work, I do so unapologetically, sans lame jokes. And I finally mastered the art of not smiling when I feel uncomfortable. I still feel uncomfortable (around strangers  classmates), but now I just stare at them blankly..which is definitely better.
