At first we may not figure why something not too good happened..."WHY ME?" is our first response. Here' what i have learnt-   If i'd performed better in entrance exams, i would have got into a better college.But some of the best friends i have today, are the ones in made in the college i landed up in. Same goes for them, i see all my best buddies, and wonder what brought us together. Bad marks!?!!! Same goes for the job front too.If i was in a better,bigger,more reputed company, i wouldn't have met the wonderful people who've become very good pals too! Coming to office is surely something i look forward to!!!   So, my reasoning is...if you wait long enough, you'll begin to see the light. It applies to any case, maybe a heart break too. You thought it was the perfect relationship,then things went sour- you sit and mope around for days, months, maybe years too. Ultimately, another person comes along, and you realise, this is it!    Everything, happens for a reason. Only, the reason isn't evident at first. Slowly but surely, things become clear.    Patience and an attitude to accept things as they come is they key.  Have a nice day :o)
