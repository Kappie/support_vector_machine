I'm typing this into Notepad while I'm on hold with my ISP.  The lights are on on my modem, but it just keeps dialing and never connecting.  The recording says that their e-mail server is having trouble, but who knows.  My modem is only 6 weeks old - they sent me a new one when I moved.  I hope it's not fried.    Hip Hip Hooray - it's working again!  We don't know what was wrong, but I do know how to fix it.  Unplug power from the modem, shut the comp down and have another go.
