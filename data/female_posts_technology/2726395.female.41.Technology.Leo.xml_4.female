This is particularly egregious because I also have no patience for other people who are impatient. I'm always telling people, "calm down, there's nothing you can do about it," or, "take control of it and make a plan and follow through, don't just wait around for something to happen," or the one I've been repeating a lot lately to the various male friends in my life: "No, you aren't having a midlife crisis, you have a lousy job. They aren't mutually exclusive."    But when it's my turn to wait, there is nothing that can console me. And right now I am doing a lot of waiting. I'm up for a really good job that is so perfect for me you'd think God heard my prayers. It is in Fremont, it is in my industry, my boss would be in Germany,so I would have to use my German, especially when I traveled there on the company dime, and I would be working while all my superiors were asleep nine hours away. It  just doesn't get any better than that, except that it also pays considerably more than I'm making right now.  They've told me I am the candidate. They have told me they will be sending me an offer letter. Twice now. And so far, no letter has appeared.  The offer was to be contigent upon passing a background check, anyway, which won't be complete until probably tomorrow, or Friday. But I wanted to have at least something on paper that says "you liked me. You really liked me."  I am a theatre geek, I need instant gratification, instant approval. It's why I hated radio and TV.  It doesn't help to know that if I got this letter, there's nobody here to even give notice to until next week.  But I am impatient. As my sister Nancy wrote in her often family-bashing blog, the sign of a true Depper is to be riddled with anxiety, spitting adreneline and desperate for someone other than myself to blame. That sums it up pretty well, except that I am not blaming anyone else. I am impatient because I am impatient. (It suddenly strikes me as funny that Nancy, in her vitriolic attacks upon her own family, points out that she is desperate for someone else to blame because she is a Depper; effectively blaming someone else for the fact she is desperate for someone else to blame.)  I wait also for Thomas, suddenly terribly paranoid and acting like a trapped animal, I can almost see him pacing in his cage. I want to tell him this, but it would do no good. Thomas builds his own cages and he is very good at it. He's also really good at tossing the keys beyond his own reach. That's his neurosis. But I wait for him to calm down and be normal again, wait for him to return to the sweet and gentle man I learned to love like a brother. Wondering if he ever will, or if I can get used to him being as touchy as he is about absolutely everything. And he's probably waiting for me to calm down and get this stupid letter from this company that is dangling it before me like a piece of carrot cake just out of my reach.    I hate waiting.
