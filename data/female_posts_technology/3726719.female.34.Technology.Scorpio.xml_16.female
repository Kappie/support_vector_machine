He and I talk about most anything and have fun hanging out.  We've shared a couple intimate moments.  We are both aware enough to know that those moments were pretty darn good.   So, bucking myself up to be brave and go for it, I posed the question to him "what's the possibility that you would be interested in having sex with me on a regular basis?"  Needless to say I struck him speechless.  He was taken aback enough to laugh.  We are both either dating other people, or online searching for an other people to date in my case.  I think he was hoping it was a joke.  Of course it wasn't.  His concern is that sex on a regular basis would result in caring more and becoming more attached.  We are pretty much not the others ideal.   And we've got a good friendship going, so why ruin that.  I made the point of telling him that nobody ever liked me more or got more attached to me by having sex with me.  And we're friends convenient to each other.  It's just sex right?  Boy did I feel like a fool.  Talk about getting offline as fast as possible and hiding in my room.  And I cried over it.   Cried my eyes out.  Scared because I don't want to mess up a good friendship, humiliated at the rejection, and angry for being used a couple times before.  Talk about wishing you could take a conversation back!  Of course I tossed and turned over it all night last night.  Got to work before 8:00 because I was sleeping so bad.  I feel like I've been hit by a truck this morning.  Hopefully a good yoga workout this evening will help set me to feeling right again.  Speaking of workouts....like that segway......I walked the greenway again last night.  Then after a quick stop back at the house for the walkman, I went back and hit the track at McGavock.  In total I probably got 3 miles in last night.  It felt good to wear myself out.  I'm still sore from the batting and golfing Tuesday night.  That's why I'm thinking yoga for tonight.  The stretching will help work out the rest of the soreness.   And a really cool thing.....after weeks of bouncing between 193 and 200....the scale said 190 this morning!!!  I'm psyched.  As for stitching....there's been none.  I don't feel settled enough to sit down and focus on it.  I don't know when I'm going to get back to it either.  I'm having an eye issue that is concerning me and I think it's part of the reason I'm not stitching.  I'll keep you posted on that.  On the work front....it's gotten very busy for me.  I'm working extra again as we kick up the analysis phase of a new project.  Lots to be done in a short time.   It's fun!  So Seal IV is cranking in the earbuds and I'm going to get back to working away.  Here's to Thursday.  Mel  Update to this post....we've IM'd this morning....my friend and I.  He said no worries, the question didn't make him uncomfortable.  Sigh of relief.  To be honest, there's some disappointment here too.  It would have been a lot of fun on a regular basis.  Ce la vie...more fun for the next lucky stud-muffin that comes into my life!  ;)
