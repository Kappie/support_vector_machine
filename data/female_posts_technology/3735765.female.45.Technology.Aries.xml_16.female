I will be sharing these posts with you on the upcoming posts.  I hope that you will enjoy and share the excitement that I felt as I embarked upon this new journey! :))    It is the night before our orientation and I'm anxious to meet the other folks I'll be going on this trip with.  So far, we have been emailing each other during the past few months.  The countdown has begun as I have also mad my passport application today.  I will finally get to put faces with those people with those people I have been talking to and get some more answers about our trip itinery and journey, as well as tips on dealing with the customs, lores and faiths fo the Guatemalan folks so as we don't offend anyone during our travels and sightseeing.  I pray that people in Guatemala are as excited about us coming there as I am about going there and gaining the opportunity to understand their culture even more!
