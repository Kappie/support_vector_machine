I know that people are loyal to their chosenpolitical parties, but there has to be a point when you realize that your elected (or in this case "selected")officials are no longer worthy of that loyalty. So, what is it? Are the Bushites brainwashed, or are they the largest group of ignoramuses that ever lived? Come on people - WAKE UP!!Look at what your belovedCommander in Thief has done.Unless you're a war profiteer, are you truly better off than you were 4 years ago? Or are you like the rest of us that can't deny the feeling of impending doom. THAT is the legacy of this "president."   The saddest part is that this administration has done SO much damage to us, and the rest of the world, that even if Kerry does win, he won't be able to begin to undo the damage. It is going to take decades, or longer.
