I've never really noticed this before or really looked at the ads.  My post from last night was about my blog template and my blog.  The corresponding ads are for web hosting and some dual platform thing.  Makes sense.   When I was creating the post below about the bunny, I went to the blog I referred you to in order to get the link.  I happened to glance at his ads - noting that the Easter Bunny post has been up for a full 24 hours and is probably being returned in search requests - and saw that they are for Easter Bunny baskets and painting eggs.  It's just a matter of time before mine are for the same thing.    If I'm always griping about Windows, for example, and talking about the wonders of Macs, and there is an assumption that the people who read my blog have similar interest, it makes sense that they would target ads for Macs to people who visit my blog.  Overall, I think the ads are pretty smart, even if they're a little off-target once in a while.
