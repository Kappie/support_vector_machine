We had our dinner in Fish  Co where I was only updated with Shirley's new relationship then. We moved to Baker's Inn to have our desserts and we had a good laff. Sometimes I miss the days when we were back in secondary school. Days were so good then....  ***  I was thinking whether I should be going to take a week's leave to do a crash study at home. After going out with them, I felt that I am really a no-lifer.... everyday needs to study and work...damn sianz...
