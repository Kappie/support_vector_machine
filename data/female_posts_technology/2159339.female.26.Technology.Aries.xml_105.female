Wendy was my boss at the university dental office that I worked at through high school and have been going to every 6 months for teeth cleaning/biopsies/tumor checks/surgeries. K worked there after I quit so between us, we have about 8 years of work invested in "that" place. Wendy was our boss and she was awesome and laid back and generally the greatest bosslady one could hope for. She died of anorexia. It's terrible to think that it could have been prevented, but it's a physical manifestation of a mental illness and unless she wanted to change her eating habits, no one could help her. It fucking sucks. We both have funerals to go to in the next few days.
