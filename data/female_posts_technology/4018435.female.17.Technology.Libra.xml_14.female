Today I basically slept and talked online. I got a message from megan but she was online for a second when I was taking a nap in the basement. Arg! I can't believe I missed it!  got to talk to shawn today :)  I can't wait for him to come home. I want to give him the drawing i did of him in first semester.           Going with Jorel tomorrow to pick up his car FINALLY! Booya! Turbo engine! Yep, he promised I'd be the first one to ride in it! thanx for switching shifts with me kevin! Yay!           Tonight I was hanging with Shane and Kev. We kicked back to some KFC, chocolate bars, Mike, Maltesers, what else...i dunno but i got sick in the end...yep..my stomache hurts...           I sat around today questioning life's beauty and the pain that we also feel. I was thinking deep again of course. It's funny how one moment I believe that life is full of surprises and is absolutely beautiful but the moment that one second change occurs, it's hell on earth... It's a hard thing to do, balancing out your emotions.          I wanna go shopping...i need new clothes to match my new room...I haven't been on a real shopping spree for clothes and not even close for a year or two now...damn that makes me sad. Yeah, I really should stop spending my paychecks so early....           Well....I should go to bed now. got a pick day tomorrow. Kel wants me to go with her to get a piercing...maybe the helix? That'd be kool.  I want my helix pierced too...hm...                                    Life is what you make of it. You take control. If you choose to follow, then follow. If you choose to love, then love. If you choose to fail, then fail. But if you choose to succeed, then try.  -The Lonewolf
