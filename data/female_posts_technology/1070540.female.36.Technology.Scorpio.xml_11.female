This may sound stupid..but I have a toe that I can not feel the tip of.. I thought it was because i was just cold..but I have put on really thick socks..and it is still feeling funny.  I guess if it doesnt get better tonight I will get it looked at tomorrow. I am scared.  I reallly like having this blogger...a place to put my thoughts that no one will ever read.
