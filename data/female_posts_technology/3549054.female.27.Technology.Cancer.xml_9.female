He took a few coins from his pocket and dropped them into the hat. He then took the sign, turned it around, and wrote some words. He put the sign back so that everyone who walked by will see the new words.  Soon the hat began to fill up. Lot more people were giving money to the blind boy.   That after noon the man who had changed the sign came to see how things were.  The boy recognized his footsteps and asked, "Were you the one who changed my sign this morning? What did you write?"   The man said, "I only wrote the truth. I said what you said but in a different way."   What he had written was: "Today is a beautiful day and I cannot see it."   Do you think the first sign and the second sign were saying the same thing?   But the first sign simply told people to help by putting some money in the hat. The second sign told people that they were able to enjoy the beauty of the day, but the boy could not enjoy it because he was blind.  Should we be surprised that the second sign was more effective?   There are at least two lessons we can learn from this simple story.   The first is, "Be thankful for what you have. Someone else has less. Help where you can."   The second is, "Be creative, Be innovative, Think differently THERE IS ALWAYS A BETTER WAY!"
