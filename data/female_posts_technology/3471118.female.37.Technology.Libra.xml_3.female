Unless I go away, the Counselor will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. 8 When he comes, he will convict the world of guilt[1] in regard to sin and righteousness and judgment: 9 in regard to sin, because men do not believe in me; 10 in regard to righteousness, because I am going to the Father, where you can see me no longer; 11 and in regard to judgment, because the prince of this world now stands condemned.   A little confusing, the learning Bible wasn't as much help as it usually is.  It's a little hard to see the relevance to my life here.  It seems to be more just general information Jesus was providing.  Maybe I'm not understanding it completely.  He's saying that unless he "went away" (died on the cross? ascended into heaven?) the Holy Spirit would not come to the disciples, so it was for their good that he was going away.  When the Holy Spirit came, he would rule the world to be guilty of sin, because people in the world did not believe in Jesus.  They would be found guilty in righteousness (and again, I hate that word, it really persists in having no meaning to me) because Jesus was going to heaven with God and wouldn't be able to be physically "seen" anymore (and maybe because of my aversion to the word "righteousness" I don't really understand this verse).  And they would be found guilty in judgment because Jesus was judged and condemned to death when he didn't do anything wrong.  (The learning Bible says this verse refers to the defeat of Satan -- I'm not seeing or getting that.)  So basically, I don't understand most of this.  What I do get from it is that Jesus had to die in order for God to give us his Holy Spirit, which is what allows Jesus to continue to live in us.  And anyone who doesn't have the Holy Spirit is going to be found guilty of their sin, judged, and condemned.  I think that's what I get from it, anyway.
