When I had first read this essay it seemed to me that there was a tone of what is labeled as “man bashing”. In reading it a second and third time, the tone changed. When she says, “As I thought about him while I was ironing one evening…” it sounds as if it is a matter of fact kind of thought. She wasn’t angry or resentful, she was quietly ironing.   Her repetition of the “I want a wife” separates the activities, duties, jobs, and life of a wife. I think that if she didn’t have this repetition that all of these things would blend into one another and lose the effect of exactly how many things a wife does.  I can relate to this essay. This essay is me. I am a wife and a mom. I realized what it is that I do. I know what I do, but have thought about it all separately. When it is put down in black and white, in one essay, it is more powerful. The life of a wife is a tremendous task and I would expect that the burnout rate would be high and if it isn’t, why? I would be interested to know what it was that she felt after the realization of what her life entailed. Did she accept this description and continue to live her life this way, was she angry, or did life change in her marriage and her relationship with her husband, with regards to equality. This essay should be a mandatory read for husbands to be!
