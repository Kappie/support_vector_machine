The next Tuesday we get together we'll be hearing things like, " My old lady  took her girl scout troop to the circus", and " My old lady  got a Sunnydale high class ring because our spaz friend Valerie keeps flaunting hers". Yes, just exactly like that.  Because here in the south that is the proper way to refer to ones' wife. It's what we do (I hope those of you with wives already are writing this down). Twains, 8p.m. If I left anybody off the email list, oh well.  No wait, em, I meant to say, forward this to them (...stupid disregard for social skills). But not if they suck (...rude disregard for social skills).   Big time linkage fun  urlLink http://www.nopantsday.com/     (Andrea 90210 in particular will find this amusing. If only because she's so fond of yelling at me to go put some on.)   urlLink http://www.kirstenjohnson.com/touchy.html     Seriously brilliant yet disturbed Canadian artist. She's based in Toronto but I am hoping to find one of her calendars in Vancouver.     urlLink http://www.mrbrainsfaggots.com/     I've sent this to some of you before but because I'm 10 years old it never stops being funny.   urlLink http://www.cockeyed.com/inside/howmuchinside.html    Fascinating and educational.      Buffy: "There you go, and I double-sized it for ya."  Xander: "Oh, thank you!"  Buffy: "And cut way back on the cat."  Xander: (mouth full) "CAT?!"  Buffy: "Just kidding.  Probably ." -Buffy the Vampire Slayer
