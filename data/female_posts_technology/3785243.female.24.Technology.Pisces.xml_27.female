He rents out vacation houses to travelers seeking a respite from the busy world.  He has a wonderful photo gallery of a Spanish gypsy betrothal, as can be seen  urlLink here .  At the bottom is a photo gallery showing how olives are harvested and transformed into the yummy goodness that is olive oil.  I've been extremely busy and haven't had much time to prepare dinner.  So I've been busy buying crusty Italian and French bread and putting  urlLink Lucini's olive oil  on it.  To make it really good, you can crack fresh peppercorns over it, although the Lucini's is high enough quality and has a bite of its own that that's not really necessary.    -- Aeryth
