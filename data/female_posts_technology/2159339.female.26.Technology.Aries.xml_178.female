I vowed to make this my last shoe purchase  at least  until my debt dips under 2 grand.  But I must say, I'm in love. Sure, they're too small on the sides and too long lengthwise, but the thought of exchanging them for a more 'fitting' pair over snail mail doesn't appeal at all. So I stuff the toe with wads of toilet paper and hope they don't fall off when I exit the bus.
