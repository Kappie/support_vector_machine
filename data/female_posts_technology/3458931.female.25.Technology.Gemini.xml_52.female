Only my town would feature such talent on Canada day: a comedian who read his skit from a notebook, an elvis impersonator, and  urlLink "Pimp Tea" . We also watched the skit by the  urlLink Calithumpians ; I had no idea they've been around for 25 years!  I ate a three-dollar slice of pizza and washed it down with a dollar-fifty bottle of water, go capitalism! I still liked it better than Halifax last year though, much more family oriented.  Just two hours until we leave for the fireworks!
