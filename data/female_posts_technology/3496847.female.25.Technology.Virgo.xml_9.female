I feel lazy on the days I don't run.  Once my running is under control I'll do more crosstraining.  Running is enough *new* in my life.  I don't want to overdo it and give up on running or exercise again.  I want to make a lifestyle change and have a fun hobby.  Running works for me, but not if I go all gung-ho and wear myself out.  Then I just give up and go all lazy.    Since my runs have been getting more difficult, I've decided to break them down by day.  I'll still only post them once a week, but I'll talk seperately about each run and the week as a whole.   Day 1  - today's run was tough.  I had to stop for 15s at 2mins into the last 3min interval.  My calves were killing me, so I did a quick stretch.    Day 2  - better run today, but that last 3min interval was tough.  I read my watch wrong and stopped about 10s too early.  I made up for that by making the last running interval 2mins, not 90s.  I wanted to run until my watch beeped.  I set it for 20mins and count down the intervals from there.  There's a certain satisfaction in only stopping when the timer goes off.   My watch is a Timex  Rush .  It has an alarm, a stopwatch, and 10 pre-programmed timers (1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45mins and 1 hour.)  And the display is a good size.  I can read it with just a quick glance.  It's hard to read in low light, so I might replace it before winter (maybe with a Garmin Forerunner.)  I'd recommend it as a decent beginner's watch.  Okay - sorry for the sales pitch.  Day 3  - I din't make it through the whole run today.  It seems that I've caught a cold.  I'm going to take the weekend to recover.  If I'm not feeling absolutley dreadful on Monday I will try Week 3 again.  I'd like to be confident that I did a good Week 3 before I attempt Week 4.     Overall  - My legs were more sore this week.  It's my calves that kill me.  My quads and hamstrings seem okay, but I walk a lot and I go up at least 6 flights of stairs a day.
