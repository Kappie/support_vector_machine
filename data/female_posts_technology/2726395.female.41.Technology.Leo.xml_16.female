I am in the middle of preparing for what is surely the largest and most important event that I am personally in charge of in my life--the events surrounding Force's acquisition by Motorola--and I have this now. Finally someone is giving me oodles of money and telling me, "you don't even work for us yet, but here's a few thousand bucks, go out and create one hell of a rollicking good time for 100 people. You have 48 hours. GO." And unsaid, "we're watching. If you do a good job, maybe you'll get to keep your job. And then again, maybe not."  I feel like I'm on "The Apprentice." You never saw  their  midnight panic attacks. Maybe it was just me.  I've been reading. 3 of the 4 Dan Brown books, even though I realized halfway through the second one that all the books are exactly alike; Nancy Drew for adult conspiracy theorists. So I thought I'd try something more imaginative--I never did read the Harry Potter series, and I thought it was about time.  But the monkey on my back won't go away. Thomas seems almost like a fictional character to me now, someone I just read about in a book, a character that you really thought for most of the book was a really good guy but turned out to be not so wonderful in the end. A character that you read about and think, 'I never would want to meet that guy, he's too dangerous, a potent mixture of sweetness and vulnerability, intellect and drone, selfish bastard and unfeeling cad wrapped in a delicious sugar coat.' But he will soon be back. He will soon be able to hurt me again. I have to somehow cut off that possibility. I have to find the strength within myself not to ever fall into his trap again, to keep hating him and his evil girlfriend/fiancee/wife/whatever, because if I ever stop, he can hurt me really badly. And I think the only way I can do that is to get away from the German school. And there is really no way out.   No wonder I am having a panic attack. I am a mouse in a maze, and I cannot see which path will lead me away from the traps. Do a good job, maybe get laid off anyway. Take the presidency, Thomas can hurt me. Don't take the presidency, I'm no better than he is, a promise-breaker, a committmentphobe, and, worst, an outcast there.   I feel my super burrito from La Pinata sitting on my stomach like a rock. I  so  need advice.
