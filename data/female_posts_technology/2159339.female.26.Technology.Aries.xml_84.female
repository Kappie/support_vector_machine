She is definitely  not gay, and I'm probably not gay, but if I was drunk and feeling sexy I wouldn't mind making out with her. In fact, I would probably enjoy it. Like I said, she smells nice. But the most important thing that happened on Wednesday is that I emailed XX asking for a ride to the party. Isn't that ballsy of me? Why do I do what I do? Is it because I am the hunter and he is my hot and sexy prey? Not so much because even though he said "No problem" I was a wreck thinking about why I did what I did.   I knew I had to ask him because even though he makes my heart thump loudly in my chest, and my hands shake like a mutha, and my tongue incapable of forming words, I feel like I'm in fucking heaven when he's around.   In other news, Dizzy D and I decided to split up. We're being very Euro about it all. More on this later...
