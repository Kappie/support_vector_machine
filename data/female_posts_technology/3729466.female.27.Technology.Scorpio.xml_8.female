I know I have to keep my feet on the ground and make sure he doesn't hurt me. I need to go with the flow watching out for myself.   We went to the movie this weekend watch Fahrenheit 9/11. It was a movie that made me laugh and made me cry. I can't believe this president of the U.S. I am not from here and I know there is no honest president. The president of my country is very corrupt also, but this one over here....I am telling you...he is such a liar and a cold-hearted man. This war in Iraq was unecessary. Innocent people were killed and they still are being killed. Where is this world going? It is all about the oil and our gas prices are sky rising. Why? Why be so greedy and selfish? Anyway, my opinions about this movie in general are that I would not re-elect this man again if I was a voter. This is not right what he has been doing to his nation. I support our troops, but I wish they would stay home with their family and we would not need this war. The war was supposed to go get Bin Laden and not go to Iraq.   I would recommend everyone to watch this movie. Some people who love this president would not watch it because they refuse to see the truth. Well, I don't care. I watched and I don't like what this president is doing at all.
