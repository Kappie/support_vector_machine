So I just had to tell my boss that I have to leave early to put my kitty to sleep.  Via email, and I still cried.  So then the president of the company comes in to tell me she's sorry to hear about my kitty and I can barely mutter "it's ok, he's old" without breaking down.  So I think I'm going to take a few minute break.  Go outside and clear my head.  Not that I'm very useful right now anyway.  I can't concentrate.  And I am worried how I'm going to get him to the vet because I just moved a few months ago and can't remember where the door for his little crate is.  Guess I could wrap him in a blanket.  But I don't think he'd stay still.  What a crappy day.
