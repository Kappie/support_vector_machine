But I feel like I have to make sure they get fixed.  And it has turned me into a very crabby person. I'm not very good company right now - I'm even getting on my own nerves.   And tonight is dinner with my mother and aunt. That should just about finish me.    I need a beach and the sun and a cabana boy to keep my drink fresh...
