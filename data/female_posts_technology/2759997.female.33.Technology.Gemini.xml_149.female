And I started thinking about what I've been through lately - since July:  Had surgery and was off work 12 days (should have been more)   Introduced my mother and Joe's mom (one of my first post-op outings)   My parents divorced, my father moved out, their house went on the market (and a contract is pending)   Spent 3 days in Denver   Spent 4 days in Las Vegas   My "better half" at work moved on to greener pastures   Good thing there's not much going on now - all I have to do is throw this couple's shower for my bro and his fianc√©e this weekend, go to San Francisco for a conference Sunday through Thursday, head to Chicago Friday, Cubs game Saturday, home Sunday and back to work.  Seriously, after THAT, I hope things calm down. Other than my mother buying and moving into a new house and my brother's wedding (along with all of the out of town guests and family attending the first family function post-divorce...), what  else  could happen in September?  Don't answer that.  Seriously.
