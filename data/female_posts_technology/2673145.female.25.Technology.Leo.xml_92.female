So we cancelled my air ticket and paid a small fee for it.  Last week has been slow at work. Spent my time clearing work, surfing, chatting, dozing and eating farewell lunches and dinners. The director and mangers brought us to Fullerton Hotel's Town Club for a buffet lunch. Food there sucks. Standard price of $30-ish but food is sub-standard. Don't know why my director likes that place. She often suggest to eat there when it's claim-able. Oh, and the head chef is her PRIMARY (elementary) schoolmate. So? Food still sux.  One thing I didn't like about that lunch was all the mentors in my dept were not invited whereas all the mentors in the other dept (headed by the director) were present. My dept were asked to nominate 2, so the team leader went, and asked us to vote for one mentor to go. Such a silly and wierd method. They couldn't decide among themselves so resorted to this voting means. It's like voting for your favourite mentor. But the basis of my vote was who will enjoy the food better.   Even thou the food sux, I still got full from trying a little of everything. On the same day, the mentors of my dept treated us to Gurame at ECP. Food aint fantastic, company aint great. Everyone were full from the buffet lunch to really enjoy the food fully. It could be better.  The next day, a fellow colleague celebrated his birthday with some of us by buying us dinner at Sushi Tei. OOhh.. yuuummyyyy.... I'm still reminiscencing it. Ginger slices with salmon and wasabi is sooo... sweeeet to the palate. (Hungry)  So what's now? I'm going to Bintan with a friend for a short break. That's to compensate for the US trip. Haha. Well, now my sis might have a longer break in between her job. She's planning on a Europe trip to Spain and Paris, and I'm invited!!! Woohooo!! But.. too early to get excited. Nothing is concrete yet. But the thot is exciting! ¡España, aqui vengo!
