 I hate feeling stupid more than anything else in the world.  For some reason, that's my weak spot, and it's not uncommon for me to break down bawling.  It's happened to me during tests, after talking to professors, after almost backing into someone, when someone passing on the street makes a snide remark.  A comment that other people would brush off or respond to defensively just cuts me right through.  
 I'm sure it stems from the fact that my whole life I've sought desperately for the approval of others.  I don't think I'm stupid, but I just need to accept that everyone does stupid things sometimes, and not get so upset about it.
