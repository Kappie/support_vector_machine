So I was giving her a bunch of crap about    that until this happened: Man is attending the wedding of one of his daughters    with his girlfriend. He has an ex-wife but loathes her so tells everyone she is    dead. Ex-wife and girlfriend meet in the bathroom and have a row. Ex-wife    pitches one in the middle of the wedding which is then called off. Oh my god,    never mind my objections, this is EXACTLY like my soap!     2) The golf coven Heather’s here object to slow play (and god knows we can't    play ready golf, that is some sissy American rule). But you've seen me in action. "Where’s my ball? Here, I'll help you find your ball. Oh, I need a mulligan. Oops now I need another mulligan. I have to go to the bathroom. Wait, I need to take a picture." etc. all. So it's nothing but slow play with me involved. We ended up letting four, that's right FOUR, groups play through! It    was the longest nine holes of my life. I think it took 3 hours or something.     3) The Kingdom of Fife is a magical place. Too bad they already have their    quota of fairy princesses. They really do not know what they are missing, not    having me in the position.     4) They have such bizarre names for stuff here that it's no fun for me to use    my nicknames. For example the BQ is the home depot. Which I would refer to as    the homo depot. But why bother? Home depot means nothing so homo depot wouldn't    be funny. Knackered is tired. A 1st story condo is a 2nd story condo, a vest is    a wife beater, mad means insane not angry, pissed means drunk not angry,  a    tattoo is a military marching, drumming thing. Fries are chips (big, soggy and    cold, yuck), if you like-like someone you fancy them, if it's bullshit it's    crap. If you're telling some silly story with facts and statistics you've    pulled out of your bottom, it's crap. (sorry McKenna)    But Africa hot? That's one they don't have and absolutely love.(Although how    the mid to low 70s can be considered Africa hot is beyond me)     5) "Are you going to smoke that fag or play some golf?" (Umm, ok I know  fag   means cigarette but it still comes as a shock the first time somebody  says it   and actually means it). Oh ye of little faith, I will be doing both at the same    time. Could this have added to the slow play? Nah .    6) Luckily the high 5 isn't popular here. It has been pulled on me 3 times    though. So I taught them my special, alternative high 5. They now think it is a    wacky American thing. Ha, ha, I'm making the rest of you look mad too.     7) Everyone I've met has been quite surprised that I liked to drink. They had    heard Americans didn't. But I've proved to them that we Americans are as  big of  drunky drunks as the Scottish. Ha, Ha I'm still making the rest of you look mad.     8) Ok this is odd. Maybe I've missed something in the translation (or I could    quite possibly have been drunk) but my friends here have decided that  Valerie    is my stage name. What the hell?! I've never even mentioned any stories involving stages.     9) When we went to St. Andrews last week we had a nice picnic by the sea and there were some kids splashing around in the water and they were blue. So my friend decides I absolutely have to "go into the ocean" while I'm here. This particular torture is planned for tomorrow.   I tried to explain about my "pool" at home and how it is blood warm. And how, even at 8 at night I can stand around in my swim suit and cowboy hat flicking ashes and skimming leaves and it is still Africa hot. Now did you see the phrase "bloody freezing cold water" anywhere in that story? No, you did not. I didn’t pack a swimsuit either so whatever I wear is bound to be disturbing and not swimming related in any way.     10) As you may or may not know, I am a geriatric magnet. Some people are freak magnets, well the senior citizens are drawn to me. You'll be amused to learn that has not changed one bit here in Edinburgh. All I have to do is pull a map out of my pocket, don't even have to unfold it, and the next thing I know the    nearest little old lady has me by the arm dragging me off to my destination. On the way to the library a few minutes ago I was stopped by a geriatric and told I had, "lovely, just really lovely" legs. The only person that has told me I had hot legs was some 70-year-old grandmother. Yeah, that's lovely all right.     Tee hee, well I guess that's all for now. I will see you all very soon and I’m sure I will have more special, surly Valerie stories for you about my adventures in Scotland.    Love,    Bonny Queen Valerie the Bruce
