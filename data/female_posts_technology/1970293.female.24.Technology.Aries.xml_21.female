This site is a recording studio interested in providing a better way for musicians to play their music by posting their songs on the internet.  The user may listen to the music and if the user wants, pay the recording studio anywhere from $5 to $18 for the music.  Then the user may download the music to their PC for their listening entertainment. The recording studio also offers Shoutcast for winamp.  The website is very well designed and the idea has merit.  So far I have listened to Beth Quist and the music is excellent.  She composes New Age/World music which makes a very interesting sound.  Les Filles de Sainte-Colombe with viol  harpsichord music for the classical genre.  This is very relaxing.  spineCar playing heavy modern rock is metal through and through.  I recommend this music to anyone who wants something different and something a little cheaper than the music they sell today.    All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003
