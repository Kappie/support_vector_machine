My inner child is forty-five years old!    I've never really liked children, not even when I was one. I want things neat, ordered, and adult--fine wine instead of french fries, pina coladas by the pool instead of beach sand between my toes. Now if only my fellow adults would stop acting like such, well, children!    urlLink   How Old is Your Inner Child?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
