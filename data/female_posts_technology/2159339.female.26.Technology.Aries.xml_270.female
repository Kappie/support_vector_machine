Dermacentor Occidentalis      The story of my weekend is that last night I pulled out a big fat brown tick from my head that must have been there since Yellowstone (a week and a half ago). The background of the story is that I've felt something in the back of my head for about a week but thought it was a zit or a piece of gum and had been tugging on it ever since. Yesterday, after taking a digital picture of my head and examining it on my laptop, it still looked undefinable. So I twisted and tugged and pulled until I finally got it out. Upon placing it on my table to examine it, I discovered that it had 8 legs and was moving around. My bro called and offered to take me to Kaiser. But first we went to the bar for J-dogg's birthday. I carried Rick The Tick in a tupperware and introduced it to my friends until it was time to head to the hospital. The doctor at Kaiser was a very nice lady but kept saying things like "Yuck", "Gross", and "I'm sorry I'm not paying attention, I'm just so grossed out right now" which kinda put me off. Then the nurse filled out my chart..."Description: tick bite. Has the tick." Other nurses and doctors came to look at the little guy since, according to one, noone's ever brought a live whole tick in before. They told me I was very lucky to get the whole thing out - usually the head remains under the skin and has to be removed in less pleasant ways. It turns out it was much smaller when it lached on, but my stellar care had allowed it to grow about 5 times its original size. The doc thanked me for donating my tupperware and G  I went back out to the bars.  They're going to run tests on the little guy to see if he carries lyme disease and if he is, then I am too. The chances are small so I'm not really worried. My head is still sore from nursing a bug for so long, but I eat less now that I'm only eating for one.
