I have pictures of each project-in-progress (except for one, but I'll get to that).  First off, Charlotte.  The whole thing:    The edge, with the pink-and-yellow yarn I love in focus:    Now, Broadripple.  One and a half socks done:    Please don't mind my glow-in-the-dark-white leg:    Feather and fan scarf:    And up close and personal with Miss Feather-and-Fan:    Amazingly, the colors in every picture are fairly true.  Charlotte (the full view) and Broadripple are a little washed-out, but what do you expect from a cheap digital camera anyway?  Next one I buy will have a better macro mode, so I can get better closeups.  I don't have any pictures of Kelly's sweater yet (Pinup Queen from Stitch N Bitch, if anyone's wondering) for two reasons.  One, it's an inch of 2x2 rib.  Not the most exciting picture in the world.  Two, I left it at a friend's apartment, so I couldn't take even a super-boring picture of it.  Kelly's seen it though, and she approves.
