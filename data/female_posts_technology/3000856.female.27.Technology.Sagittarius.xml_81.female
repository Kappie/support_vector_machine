I wanted to make a phone call but decided I probably should not cuz I would have gotten one by now if it mattered. I leave for Boston at 4. Yeah it is finally here! Thank goodness the political convention is over. I am packed and ready. Woo hoo! I bought a little mp3 player for the 2 hr plane ride and I am bringing my lyrics and music to work on also. I hate flying, I am a really bad flyer. LOL Ok well I will post either Mon night or Tues to let yas know how everything went. Laterz!
