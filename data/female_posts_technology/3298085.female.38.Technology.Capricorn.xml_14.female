( sarcasm totally)  Today after being told to stop taking the meds, and then I decided to just take half and come off easy...I had awaken to a more swollen tongue and a few hours later my left side began to shake.  From my neck down. I almost thought it was a seizure. The Benedryl is not working for the swollen tongue. It may not be an allergy. We will see. and then an hour or so later I had another left side spasm. It is Uncontrollable but suddenly in about 2 minutes it stopped. So I get to talk to my doctor a nice loooong conversation. I am going to research more.....
