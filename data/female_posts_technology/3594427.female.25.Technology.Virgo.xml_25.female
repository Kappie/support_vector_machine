Before anything else, please congratulate me for finishing my Level 1 of Conversational Mandarin Chinese. That doesn’t mean I can already speak Chinese, but I can understand some of the words already. Plus, I can already count and sing “Happy Birthday!” in Chinese.    Last, last weekend, I ended up camping out at my friend’s house and watching movies the whole time. I started my movie marathon on Friday night, by watching “Mean Girls” with a couple of people. Then on Saturday, I watched “American Wedding” and “40 Days and 40 Nights”. On Sunday I decided to watch “Sense and Sensibility” for the nth time. I didn’t mind because it is one of my all time favorite films.    I thought “Mean Girls” was going to be the typical teenage film where silly girls chase after dorky guys. I was surprised when I actually enjoyed watching the film. It was funny, smart and actually had something to say how bad teenage girls can be to each other. Actually in real life, this also applies to how grown-up women behave especially if they are working in corporations. Hahahahaha!    An interesting point the movie raises is how smart women have to pretend that they are helpless in order to get a guy interested in them. I never really got that about men. They always need to feel like they are in control of the situation or know more than others. Oooppss….I think we better change the topic before I start complaining about guys again.    After watching the movie, my friend invited me to camp over at her place. So the next day, since we were both really tired, we just decided to stay at her place and watch DVDs. I ended up watching “American Wedding” and “40 Days and 40 Nights”. I needed to watch movies that didn’t really require me to think. I wasn’t able to catch them in Manila because at the time they were showing, I was too busy preparing for my relocation to Singapore.    I never really liked the “American Pie” series. I guess I’ve never really been comfortable with typical “guy humor”. I don’t think you need to make jokes about sex all the time just to get some laughs from your audience. I ended up watching the first 2 movies because people were always dragging me to watch with them. By the third film, the jokes have become too stale and lame so I was bored within the first 30 minutes. Plus the story was really muddled up. The writers had no idea if they really wanted to go for the shock factor again or if they wanted a wholesome family film. The audience ends up just as confused as them. Even if I didn’t really find the film funny, I watched it because I just wanted to see how the whole series ended. Honestly, I thought the way they closed it was just too sentimental for me. I guess I just can’t relate with the idea of settling down for good with someone since marriage is definitely out of the question for me at the moment.    “40 Days and 40 Nights” was another movie about men, but it had a different premise. The lead character played by Josh Hartnett decides to become completely celibate for 40 days as his sacrifice for the Lenten season. Of course, he had to be Catholic because Catholics seem to have the most guilt about sex as compared to most other religions. It wasn’t such a bad film. I’ve just never been a fan of Josh Hartnett because I think he’s handsome but boring. Also I just didn’t see the big deal about not having sex at all for 40 days. Some people can go for years without it. Well, I guess I also would not be able to understand his situation since I’m not a guy.    The last movie I watched from my friend’s DVD stack was “Sense and Sensibility”. It’s still one of my all –time favorite romantic films, so there’s really no point in my writing about it. I loved the way Emma Thompson adapted Jane Austen’s book for the big screen. I could totally relate with Kate Winslet’s character. It was actually after watching that film that I decided she would play me if my life were made into a movie. Then there’s Hugh Grant, who will always be the perfect guy for romantic comedies because you can make him do ridiculous things, but he’ll still always be very charming.    So that’s how I bummed around for one whole weekend.
