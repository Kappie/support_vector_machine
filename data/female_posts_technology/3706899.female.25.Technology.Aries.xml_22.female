I'm having so much fun stringing the beads onto the yarn *eyeroll*  Last night I finished a bucket hat out of Noro Iro, and now I just have to block it. I should have distributed the decreases better on the brim rather than pair them up next to each other. The brim has an odd point on it now. Other than that, I haven't finished anything since last entry. Le sigh. I've been so depressed I haven't even felt like knitting.
