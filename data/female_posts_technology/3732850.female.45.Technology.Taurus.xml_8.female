I give more effort on my writing now that I have a teacher that cares to help me and others that have troubles writing. I don't like to write, but I feel comfortable writing now.  I can decribe things alnog with keeping it short. I have a different outlook on writing, but I still wouldn't want to do it for a living! I actually look forward t0 coming to class, when you have teacher that is tough but also caring it helps the writer. Then , you have more confidence about yourself on writing a paper or essay.
