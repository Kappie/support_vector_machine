Many times, (especially in the summer) it was my job to cook dinner because my mother would work. We would have to have everything done in time for me to get to hockey practice.I found our meals to be very rushed, if I was to have any dinner around 5:00p.m. or 6:00p.m. at all. Alot of times I would have to wait until after hockey practice to have dinner, and then we usually picked up something from a fast food place.
