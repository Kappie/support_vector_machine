Sold out with not an empty seat in sight, both bands took the stage together at 7:45pm.  They played until 8pm, when Chicago said goodbye for a while and EW took the spotlight until 9:30pm.    Phillip Bailey is a fantastic performer and has wonderful vocals, what amazing talent!  I can honestly say I have heard one song by their band, yet I still say they rival most of the bands I know of in a live performance.  The energy and emotion coming from their performance is intoxicating.  At 9:45p, Chicago took the stage and it was quite funny watching the audience decide whether to sit or stand.  EW gave such a hyped performance that had everyone dancing and grooving, standing and cheering with all their might!  Yet when Chicago came on things mellowed out dramatically... nobody quite knew what to do!  The original members are still playing the horns, but of course there was no Peter Cetera to sing original vocals.  Instead the vocals were done by a few new hotter, younger guys that did an okay job of it.  Around 11p, EW came back up on stage for the finale songs.  They went back and forth like the opening sequence, helping out on each other's songs.  The final performance was Chicago's "25 or 6 to 4" which is one of my favorites.  Overall it was a great show!  A little note about the Dodge Theater:  Don't sit in the 11th row.  Along all the floor sections, the first 11 rows are all on the same level as the stage, with the 12th row (and higher) elevated one step for each row.  Sitting in the 11th, I had to look through 10 rows of standing, dancing people to try to see the folks on stage who were basically eye level with me.    Although I was only 60 feet away, I barely had a view the entire show, thanks mostly to the 6'8" giant sitting a foot in front of me.  (Being 5'4" myself, I got some good looks when he was leaning over to whisper to his wife.)  The row behind me was a good foot above my head, and couldn't care less whether we were sitting or standing because they (and everyone behind them) could see right over the first 11 rows of heads with ease!  While I'm at it, I should also tell you not to sit on the balcony at the Dodge Theater either.  Not only is it so high it's like an oven in the building, but when Blue Man Group was rocking hard, so was the balcony.  We all thought we were going to crash at any minute, and I got sea sick with the movement all night long!
