The few things that were really there in common were, the 9 pills, which is now up to 10 plus some weird syrup which tastes like a cross of complan and bricks...the thinking mode for the weekend...and one injection...hahaha!  Well, things kindof got started on saturday when I watched this movie called Chalte Chalte, quite an ironic movie about this guy who seem to do everything wrong with this girl, she marries him, and he continues to let her down.  Whatever he did, he did it wrong and earns her anger and heartbreak.   The biggest joke is that the woman knows that he wont change and yet goes back to him just becoz he begs!  Man, this is the heights of stupidity!  Where is the sense of remorse or atleast a show of reason to change for your partner!  Anyway, movie apart this kindof set my thinking mode off.   I needed from fresh air and my parents were kindof busy, so I decided saturdays I will head to the park close by and do some serious work there....so it was for the next 1 hour, I headed to the park and did some thinking in the walk mode.  For that one hour I just analysed my life, where I stood, what I had lost, what I had gained, what I needed to do, what I needed to shed.  Ofcourse, before I realised it began to get dark and needed to head back home, so had my exercise for my mind and body really...Was supposed to head to the beach in the evening, but due to the arrival of my uncle and aunt, just headed the club.   At the club, my next level of thinking began, and there were just two questions which came to my mind.... 1.  What makes me a woman who can swing to any extremes to make people happy? 2.  What sort of a family situation will make me bring happiness to people around me?  To answer these questions, I took out a piece of paper and began to write a long open letter about these two areas.  The more I thought, the more the thoughts kept flowing.....and what do you know, before I knew it the stress began to go sky high and my legs started to go numb slowly.  Thank god for me, was heading back home by the hospital, so took a shot and then headed home.  Obviously, in this condition no one would allow me to sit and do anything, so was packed to bed at 9 pm...boohooo!  Sunday...hmm...different issue altogther, woke up at 9;30am, and decided I was gonna relax and totally chill off.  Spent some time with my uncle and aunt, initiated work on a few pending orders, and then headed to have an oil bath.  Gosh, never realised to what extent I am a "hot" person..;)  hahaha...well, got the ordeal over with shikakaai....more in my eyes ..hahaha...and some sambarani......hair smells really odd now!!!  Then sat down for lunch at 2pm, boring lunch...hardly felt like eating, so skipped most of the stuff.  Then sat down with my parents and finalized the house plan and gave it to the architect for his expert comments.   Just hope this house comes out well, have done most of the design work in this...and should have one awesome room in the first floor, more like a studio for myself, with french windows and a painting area......and a nice bathtub to doze off hahahaha...with a good walk in wardrobe...hmm..that reminds me ..need to do some big time shopping....hardly been to spencers oflate....or maybe I should head to T Nagar or Pantheon road and pick some hip and low cost stuff up...hmm.....need to ponder over this one!  Seriously need to re stock my wardrobe....its got too boring..too many blues, greens and pinks...need to add some variety....maybe some reds, purples and browns...hmm.....maybe silver.......got this nice salwar from my uncle, a beautiful black with gold work.....looks gorgeous....need to re stitch some areas...too large for me...hahahaa!   Other than this, it  was one boring time with my aunt, hunting brides for my cousin..hahaa...had my grandparents bugging me to check out some guys...but I was like, hey, am the kid of the family, spare me....the queue is jammed in front..;)  Good joke, bu they refused to buy it..hahaha!  One thing is for sure, this weekend was quite an interesting one, very introspective, enriching for my mind and soul and more than anything, gave me a sense of direction for my artistic side!
