A friend just bought some foresty land up north (somewhere near Napa) so I'm going there for a couple of days. Also, my French class ends today and the HTML class ended last week, so I am finally responsibility-free.   I have started looking for another job. The promise of switching groups is still out there, but who knows how long they will dangle the carrot in front of my nose and my relationship with my boss is deteriorating fast. I'm trying to be 'pro-active' despite really really hating that word and reeeally hating the job-search process.  I saw my gramma over the weekend. When I came in to her cramped apartment, there were about 4 candy wrappers on the table and she was chewing on a piece of chocolate. Gramma, spit it out!, I said as I extended my hand, prepared to catch the piece falling out of her mouth. But she didn't spit anything out. She said that she wanted to overdose on sugar and die. Death by chocolate is odd but possible for gramm since she is extremely diabetic. She said she was feeling weak but then regained incredible strength as she proceeded to undermine every aspect of my life.  M is flying me to Missouri in September so that we can drive back together. It's been a month since our last trip and I've managed to accumulate a whopping 4 hours of vacation. Hopefully I will have enough by then. Or we'll get into a fight and the trip will get scrapped. Or I will quit/get fired and have unlimited time off.  Yesterday I took a sick (of work) day and went rock climbing with Marcus and Tomomi, a Japanese girl staying with him for two weeks. It was incredible - I learned to tie all the proper knots and belay others. This is what I would do daily if I ever met and married a rich man and quit my job. We went to get pho afterwards and then Tomomi and I did a little shopping. Today is the french presentation and I haven't even read my lines, much less memorized them. Better do that now.
