In it, I was in a doctor's office, explaining to him my concerns regarding a lump on the left side of my stomach. He looked at me sternly and said "It's either a baby or cancer. Only time will tell". In my dream this made perfect sense so I went to my dream home and waited for 'it' to grow. About 5 seconds later I felt a little baby kicking at which point I thought to myself that regardless of whether I opted for the baby or an abortion, a miserable experience was ahead, so I might as well raise the little bastard.   When I wake up I wonder if having pregnant dreams is my body's way of telling me that there's a little M junior in the oven. Kind of like when I tell myself to wake up at 6 tomorrow and my body wakes me up on time without alarms. Because that (along with eating buffalo wings and cookies every day) would explain my recent weight gain. Despite being 25, if I got pregnant now, it would still feel like a teenage pregnancy. Luckily, M offered to punch me really hard in the stomach if that were to ever happen.
