Hannity doesn't waste any time before pulling some serious punches at the liberals.  Of course, if I had expected him to I probably wouldn't have bought the book.    Maybe I'll donate it to the  urlLink UHD library  when I'm done.  The closest thing they have, using a 'Hannity' keyword search, is an Al Franken book.  Most people there have no idea who either of these people are.  It'll probably never get read, but I can say I tried.
