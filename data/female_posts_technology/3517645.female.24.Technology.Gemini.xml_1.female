I did some weeding in the garden and got ready to go out with them. The camp was great. We went to the beach. The kids love playing in the sand and building stuff well I laid out an got a tan. Harley was really good when we were down the beach unlike last time when he kept trying to sneak off over to the other camp to see the dog that was there. Harley loves the water. We through sticks for him and sometimes he just wades around. Everyone was up there and the kids had a great time going to visit everyone.   On Sunday night we went swimming at the hotel and then had supper with duane's parents. It was ok, but I could have been doing other things around the house, like cleaning up.   I went to the dentist on Monday, she said I had beautiful teeth and then hung out with duane's parents at the mall. The bought the kids some new sandals and sneakers. Which saved me some money.
