Make sure to see them next week with Home Grown! Fenix played an hour long set with a mix of songs from both CDs plus a reworked (and awesome) version of O'Bleek from their first EP. They sounded really good, especially since they only practiced twice in 3 years a week before the show. Unfortunately they couldn't do an encore because of time restrictions getting ready for the second show. The second show hellogoodbye opened and the kids were singing along and dancing. A bunch of them had been to the BBQ and Kickball game that Hellogoodbye hosted before the show. The second Fenix show blew away the first show. They played a longer set and the crowd was singing the words to every songs REALLY loudly. The band seemed to have a good time. Thanks to all of the people who flew in from NY, London and Japan for the show! It was awesome to see everyone out there and brought back good memories since Fenix Tx were the first band we ever signed.  By the way, Fenix Tx made a LIMITED EDITION, hand silk-screened poster (on card stock) for the show. They look AWESOME. They sold 100 out of the 150 at the show, and all of the guys in the band signed the other 50 to sell on our store, so check it out. They also made shirts for the show, and we are selling the remaining shirts on the store as well. Both items will be under the autograph and special items section of the store.
