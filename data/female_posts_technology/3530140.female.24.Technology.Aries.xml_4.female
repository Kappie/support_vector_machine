While I'm on the subject of catching up, I took the advice of a friend and rented Sex and the City, Season One .. for the first time. Ever. I had no idea what I was missing. It's the anthem for women singletons across america. So maybe I don't live in the glamorous New York City. And maybe my Manolo Blahnik's are actually discounted Franco Sarto shoes at DSW. Perhaps more appropriately stated, my life melodrama is ..and the City. The sex part seems to be obsolete. It's an equal trade for five dollar Starbuck's coffee ice cream and a queen sized bed all to myself.  I'm content. My date this evening is sleek, sexy, and obeys my every command. I'm in love with my laptop. And as I sit on my patio composing this blog, I feel content. I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be. So here's to all the women and their personal version of Sex and the City, Celibacy and the Farm Town, Singletons and the Married...  Thoughtfully, Pinkie
