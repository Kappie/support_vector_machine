The Iraqi team showed some awesome team work, and managed to scored, Emad Mohammed, Howar Molla, Yonnis Mahmmod and finally Salih Sadeer.  The match ended 4-2 to iraq       The Iraqi fans at Greece didn't stop supporting the players along the match, and they were so maniac :P  One of the fans raised both the Iraqi flag and kurditsan's flag to show unity of new Iraq :)  Best wishes to our team for the next match against Costa Rica P.S: what's wrong with other members here, no one write sport articls here :P
