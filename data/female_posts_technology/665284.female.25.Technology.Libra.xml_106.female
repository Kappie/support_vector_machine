I imagine myself walking in the park, snug in a thick comfortable coat, the birds flying overhead, sun shining and leafless trees around.  An impromptu  urlLink Qtek  training happened today.  I am glad to be away from my seat and learn to operate a new gadget.  I hope they issue us a unit or two to familiarize ourselves with the features.
