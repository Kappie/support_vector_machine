One good bit of news (for me) - the cable service we're switching to will carry BBC America. Maybe their WB station will carry Angel. One can only hope.  The best thing about Winter is it is a time to look forward to Summer. Namely, Summer movies.   Actually, I was watching the Superbowl last night and I saw the ad for  urlLink Troy . I know most women are going to go to see either Brad Pitt or Orlando Bloom. I like Pitt as an actor and am not really attracted to him. Bloom is a puppy. Eric Bana is playing Prince Hector so I'm there, even though I know my Iliad so I know what happens to him. Kudos to Russell Crowe (another actor I like but am not particularly attracted to) for bringing back Swords  Sandals epics.  urlLink Gladiator  rocked.  My other favorite actors all seem to be in independent movies, which means since I live in East Bumble Alabama I will have to wait until they show up on DVD. Damian Lewis is in one movie that might get main stream release this year:  urlLink An Unfinished Life . Unfortunately, the movie stars Jennifer Lopez so it might get shelved because of all the backlash against her.  And a quick editorial note: I happen to like her as an actor. I really enjoyed  urlLink Out of Sight . And I happen to like Ben Affleck. I'm sorry and embarrassed for both of them. What a fuckarow (thank you, Jason Lee).  Anyway, so that movie might sit and rot on a shelf for a while. Lewis has a small role in it as Lopez' abusive husband. Hoo boy, he gets to mistreat another woman! Fortunately, he's also in  urlLink Brides , about an American photographer that falls in love with a Russian mail order bride (not his) while on board a ship. This is one of those small independent movies that will never make it to the theater, though. Bitch. But, hey! He might actually get to kiss a woman instead of hit her this time! (The woman he kissed in Band of Brothers doesn't count; he was just being polite.)  Everyone else's mainstream work is a year or two away. Most notably, Ewan McGregor reprises his Alec Guinness impersonation for one last time in  urlLink Star Wars Episode III . He gets one independent release before then,  urlLink Young Adam . The American version does not have Full Frontal Ewan in it so I'm hoping they will reinsert (*snerk!*) the footage for the DVD release.  Jason Isaacs will reprise his role as Lucius Malfoy in  urlLink Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  in 2005. In the meantime I will have to hunt down a freaking Canadian release;  New France . On the plus side, Tim Roth will be in it, too. He's been way Missing In Action for too long. Like Isaacs, he tends to get typecast as a bad guy. Last seen monkeying around in Tim Burton's  urlLink Planet of the Apes .  Christian Bale will be in  urlLink Batman: Intimidation  as the caped crusader. All the movie websites are gushing about how great the script is. Apparently someone did push the reset button so we can all safely ignore all previous Batman movies (whew). How spiffy: Michael Caine is playing Alfred - that should be fun! And Cillian Murphy, who had a tackle display in  urlLink 28 Days Later...  is playing one of the bad guys.   Since it won't be released until 2005, I will have to settle for  urlLink The Machinist . I have to dig up a comment by Jennifer Jason Leigh about Bale's diet for this movie.  Of course I'm looking forward to  urlLink Spider-Man II . I'm not a Tobey McGuire fan, but he did a great job in the first movie.   What a wonderfully shallow post. I blame the pseudoephedrine.
