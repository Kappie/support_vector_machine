Salem Lights : dirgy and distorted. very tight. v.good. but not for me because there were no melodies and no hooks. lead singer reminded me of singer from Guided By Voices because of his puffy curly moptop   The Demons : i got to BOTH early, and these dudes totally stuck out, walking around. they were completely rockabillied out:  rolled denim cuffs, pompadours with sides slicked back, chain wallets, coasters,  grommeted belts, and cowboy shirts. and they had a suspiciously large amount of male jewelry: pierced ears, big silver rings. they looked like a 50s gang the way their style was clonish and cartoonish... a big gay gang. and they were all very handsome: strong jawlines, aquiline noses, symmetrical faces. Where were they from? why were they dressed so similarly? were they a boy band? were they homos?   The answer: they're from Sweden. Ah, I SEE. They were not homos after all, but EUROS. I was excited, because I love The Hives and The Sounds, but The Demons... were just okay. They played fast rock that bordered on punk. But their songs were too long. Each song should not have exceeded 2 minutes, but they did, and that sucked. Though they made me laugh because occasionally between-songs they would whip out a comb from their back pocket and comb back the sides of their hair. It was so West Side Story and so, so gay. I mean,  Euro .   Starlight Desperation  - I'd seen these guys open for The Kills a few months back and I remember being bored by the self-indulgent posturings of the lead singer. I was annoyed by his swagger and hip swiveling. This time around, I really enjoyed their set. They were as tight as can be and fun to watch. I don't know whether it's been my subjection to so many bad bands, but Starlight Desperation was like a fresh Q-tip in my dusty ears. The guitarist on the left was pale and waxy like a corpse. The singer reminded me of Bon Jovi with his tousled shaggy hair and chiseled features but W-gal saw him as Mick Jagger. He does have a big mouth and big lips.   Detroit Cobras : I thought they were awesome: swampy and soulful with a sexy hip-shakin booty-jigglin lead singer. She reminded me of Bette Midler the way she'd sass the band and the audience, but the difference is, she wasn't cheesy. She called us motherfuckers and rolled her eyes a lot. Maybe too much. Turns out she hated San Francisco, hated BOTH, hated the audience, thought we were zombies, and finally, declared the show terrible and stated that the shows they play in SF always fall flat. "The San Francisco curse" she called it. She had a great low smoky voice and she could really belt out the songs, but to insult the people who are your bread and butter? That is uncouth. I went with the intention of buying some CDs, but decided against it in the end because I felt jilted. I also thought about how I just dropped $200 on Coachella tickets.
