She was totally suprised and our barbecue chichen wings, hamburgers, hotdogs, and deer sausage didn't turn out too shabby. We had a lot of people who helped warm up the karaoke, the bacyard deck's hard wood floors with our gettin the groove on, and we also  helped irk the neighbor by having a no-rules volleyball game in the backyard (after we had a lil bit of liquor in us...just a lil bit).  Sunday, we headed over to the downtown's Latin Festival, meeting up with the b-day girl herself and her family.  I love these downtown outdoor events!  Here's hubby buying us some chicken fajitas    Sombreros anyone?    Here's some very well done graphics on the side of a car exhibit    This just caught my eye    The happy couple...hubby's chewing on some fajitas there    Our friends' lovely daughter getting ready to climb the wall    She reached the top!    I love my camera. These moments are nice on memory but I really like them preserved to look back on.   I'll post a link to the rest of the pics later when its not so 2 am-ish in the morning. Heh..
