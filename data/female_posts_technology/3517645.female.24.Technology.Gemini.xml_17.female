We are now half way through the work year (our company year starts in febuary) and I have only completed 2 exams. This is due to the fast that we are running out of certification exams to write. We are only allowed to have so many people per team to have certain exams, for example there can only be 4 people on a team that are MCSE certified. This Friday I will be attempting for my third exam for the year. It is a new Microsoft Security exam. I am not very confident that I am going to pass, the only reason I am writing it after studying for only two weeks, although I have had 8 weeks, is because my boss insists that I take it because I am past my due date. Even though I went on vacation and only got back two weeks ago. And of course I am not going to and should be expected to study well I am on vacation, that is what it is for to get away from it all. Anyways I am not sure what this rant is about, I guess I am just tired and bored. And do not want to write this exam and have another fail on my record.
