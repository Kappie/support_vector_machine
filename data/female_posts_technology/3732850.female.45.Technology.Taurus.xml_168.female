At the beginning the author led me to believe that he was only pointing out the differences between the two peoples and their ways of life. I was not excited to read on at that point. After continuing to read, I really got sucked in by the way of thinking that this man had about the differences in the two peoples. I really like how it ended by expressing how the two peoples differ in their view of death and how he, the author, believes that his people will always be around even if they are dead. His writing gave me a very ominous feeling.
