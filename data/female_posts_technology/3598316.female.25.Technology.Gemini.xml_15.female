It's been really hot and humid here, a nice change for Alberta. The garden I planted has turned out really well...the peas are growing like mad. Not that any of you care about that.       Does anyone remember the cartoon   urlLink  Babapapa   ? What about the show   urlLink  Jeremy the Bear    ? I need to get my hands on a Babapapa episode.      Going to Calgary tomorrow....yay me. =( Flight leaves at 7am....not fun, but I got my review today which was surprisingly impressive, so I guess I have nothing to worry about going to the Calgary office.      This summer has flown by, perhaps it's age. I look back to the summers of midnight dips in Manmade lake, stonehouse bar, golfing ranges and lots of fishing. Watching bad tv until 3 am knowing you don't have to get up becuase you are on summer vacation, or playing scrabble with your best friend listening to Ben Harper while drinking cheap wine. Those days are over. Now the highlight is watching trailer park boys on Sunday nights and going to DQ on a regular basis, packing and moving, working and missing the bus. It's all over my friends. Oh wait....there is one good thing, Goat Cheeseapps and virgin pinacoladasat Ric's....compliments of Donny boy!! Thanks Don!        Great thanks, Dickmiester.
