If anyone has video of this we would love to host it on the site please send it our way.  Here is the official statement from Finch on the throwdown.  "To anyone who either witnessed or heard about today's incident at the Rolling Rock Town Fair. While we were setting up, one of the members of Disturbed, Dan Donegan, was harassing us from the side of the stage. Before we were to play, Randy (our guitarist) walked over to Dan to explain that the comments he made a few years ago were a joke, and to give him a friendly handshake. Dan proceeded to assault Randy and Disturbed's singer, David Draiman, attacked Mike Herrara (our drum tech) which caused a fight to ensue. We want everyone to know that Finch did not start this fight. However, we do not take kindly to being assaulted or having our lives threatened. We would like this little conflict to be resolved as soon as possible, but we will not give in to bullying bands threatening us or our fans."  Via  urlLink punk news.com
