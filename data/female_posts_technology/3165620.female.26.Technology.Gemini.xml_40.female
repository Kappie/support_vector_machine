Maybe if I actually had color schemes or something I wouldn't need much room, but trying to use the space to say things like "We don't have a dining room table yet so we don't know what size/shape tablecloth we'll need" seems to strain the system.  I put a comment under Living Room Decor that I am fond of dark green. It's hard to get dark shades of green. More often you run across washed out shades like seafoam, or overly bright shades like lime. We're registered for blue plaid flannel sheets. I was more into the solid hunter green ones, but Buck isn't keen on dark sheets. I let him have this one since I already own a set of queen-sized plain cotton sheets in a nice dark green.   Anyone who reads this blog,  please  do not try to figure out some sort of decorating scheme from the registry. We just aren't that sort of people. Sometimes I wonder what life would be like if I were...  I was talking to the caterer today and told her I like green, like in ivy and stuff, so I'm thinking that will probably be the main non-white color involved in the wedding decor. I guess maybe I can check "Pick some stupid colors, already!" off my to-do list. (That is an actual quote from my Outlook task list.) I figure green will provide a good color to go with whatever sort of flowers we pick.  I have no idea what sort of flowers to get. I know that Buck is not very fond of chrysanthemums, and he likes roses (probably because that is what he buys me sometimes). I wish we could use peonies, but they'll probably be out of season by then. How long are the peonies in bloom, anyway? (I'm not about to pay way extra for out of season flowers that no one will notice.)   I'm thinking I might forgo the bouquet toss, since there hardly is anyone to catch it. On the other hand, those few ladies might still want to go for it... Perhaps I should get some feedback on this.
