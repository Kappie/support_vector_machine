I am talking about the Japanese game of strategy.  This is probably the game that I see sometimes being played by men and boys using  tansan , other bottle caps of the same color and plywood with intersecting lines.  Then again, maybe not.  Anyway,  urlLink Toriyama World  hosts a manga scanlation of  Hikaru no Go  which is about a boy and the game of Go.  They also have a link explaining the concept of the game and from there I was able to get to another site dedicated to the game.  It is basically about defining territory and capturing prisoners.
