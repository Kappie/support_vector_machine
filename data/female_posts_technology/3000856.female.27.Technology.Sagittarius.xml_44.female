Found out even though I am leaving the hospital I was supposed to get another raise, but because I had been reprimanded earlier this year I lost it.  Fucking bullshit.  Yeah I got reprimanded cause I was right and the Dr was wrong (literally) I did so much research after that happened and he was very upset so went over my head, and even though I was right..... I got bent over cause I challenged a DR! 
Hung out w/ my sis and the kids last night.  For once I didn't have anything to do.  There is a shocker.  I could have hung out w/ John but because I was on call I could not go that far from the hospital.  Amazing how dedicated I am to this place knowing they have screwed me time and time again.  Going to hang w/ my sis tonight.  Joe is gone w/ my dad up north and she hates being alone.  Man I love it I don't know why it bothers her so much.  So we are gonna chill.  Wow a whole weekend of just chilling, I don't know if I can handle it! Going to my parents tomorrow for a bbq.  I should probably go buy my mom something for Mothers Day.  I am a terrible daughter.  That's about it, gonna finish some bills and get the f   out of here! Laterz
