Spanish was spoken mostly in the rural regions; no  urlLink ESL (English as a Second Language)  classes were taught while I was in school; however, by the time I moved to  urlLink Austin ,  urlLink Texas , and substituted through the  urlLink AISD (Austin Independent School District) , it was clear that Spanish was becoming more prominent as they had  urlLink ESL Programs  in all the schools within the  urlLink AISD  system.  That being said though, I returned to  urlLink San Antonio  in 1997, I discovered that, while waiting in the lobby of my bank the Hispanic influence had become even stronger.  I picked up a brochure while waiting in line for something to read, only to discover that it was written entirely in Spanish!  Additionally, I discovered that the Hispanic population had become so strong that the job hunting process was stymied by the employers asking, are you bi?? (and they meant, "are you bi-lingual??).  Job hunt after job hunt after job hunt during the last subsequent years (more than 7 years now) consitently turned me down because I wasn't bilingual.  Suddendly, I was on the recepient end of being discriminated against.  One of my greatest pet peeves is that, if they are suddenly going to make it a requirement for employees to be bilingual, then they should be offering "SSL" (Spanish as a Second Language) to help those who never took Spanish and/or need to brush up on it (like me) because they never used it on a regular basis throughout the years for free  -- just like they implemented the  urlLink ESL Programs  in all the schools within the  urlLink AISD  system.   Being back in the Austin area, I may have found an answer to a free program being taught in  urlLink Round Rock ,  urlLink Texas .  Their Senior Center is offering free classes -- just pay $8.00 to the annual membership of the Senior Center AND about $10 for the workbook.  Not a bad deal!! :)
