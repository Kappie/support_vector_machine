On Saturday morning 9am, we headed on out to  urlLink Petaluma  to meet up with friends from work. One friend actually flaked because she needed to sleep in after a hot date Friday night. Aaah, i'm sure that was more exciting than the hike. The plan was to drive down to  urlLink Point Reyes National Seashore  in convoy this time - lesson learned after the last hike. The group lost 2 people the last time - it was moiself and the friend who flaked (haha, it figures). There were 4 cars, 11 people. It took us 30 minutes or so to get to the park. We decided to take the Bear Valley Trail which was pretty easy. This trail took us to the coast about 5 miles (8 km) to Arch Rock. After the first 3 miles, I was almost sure I could walk forever in this pace and weather but coming back of course I felt my back legs starting to get sore.   urlLink    The Hikers  I was extra excited this hike because my boyfriend Budz finally get to go (after months of prodding). He almost always have this lame excuse not to go because of work or have to go see his mum and sis as our friend Jay would say. I can't blame him though, he has a wonderful family (almost just like mine, tee hee). But hey, how many people do you know actually loves to hang-out with the fam every week? I bet ya can still count 'em with your fingers if you're lucky and with your toes too maybe. Most people I know always seem to stay away from their fam. I did, but that's a different story morning glory.   urlLink      The weather was perfect. It was overcast and cool. The trail was easy and mostly flat. I like trails that work you up to sweating like a pig sometimes. I don't mind little hills and steep upgrade as long as you get a break once in a while. It keeps the hike a little bit exciting. It's also nice to see plants and trees I've never seen back home. Ferns however are pretty common. I like it when they just cover the ground - probably what a fern farm would look like I thought. Growing up in the tropics, one will find the usual banana trees, coconut trees or bamboos. And the "no or low humidity" aspect always makes a world of difference.   urlLink    Budz in Bear Valley Trail  We saw an occasional deer family grazing around the bushes. There was also a little bobcat running around. I finally saw a gofer. This one was quite brave, popping his head out for minutes at a time...interesting. I've always seen the holes on the ground but never the creature underneath.   urlLink     The trail ended on Arch Rock overlooking the Pacific Ocean. It was a beautiful scenery and a perfect spot for our picnic lunch. After working out an appetite and now the belly is full...and you can hear the sound of the ocean on the background and the waves crashing below...I should have brought a hammock, Budz sighed. The thought of hiking back another hour and a half seemed the least exciting.   urlLink    here's looking down the cliff   urlLink    Arch Rock  It was really not that bad. The hike back offered a sort of different view and scenery almost. I have to walk extra fast this time for a pee break. It's one of the bummers with outdoor activities especially if you're a girl. The perfect bush to hide seems always hard to find. By the time we were done Budz was aching for some hot bath and massage. Well, guess who's giving that tonight. I'm sure I ain't getting any this time but I'm keeping a raincheck.   urlLink     We finally got back home around 3pm. It was hot in  urlLink Santa Rosa , we hit the 90's (32 C) this weekend. We decided to kick back a little bit and planned to see a movie later. The place we're renting right now does not have an A/C so the movie theatre is the next best place to hang-out on hot summer days.  Then Barbi, Budz daughter, came home. Boy, did she have some exciting stories to tell! He was quite a young dad when he had Barbi, he was 21. Barbi just turned 20 a couple of months ago. She is such an adorable, cutest, littlest petite, lovable bubbly blonde I have ever met. Anyway, she and her friends went out to see an apparently "outlandish modern punk rock burlesk show" by the  urlLink suicide girls  Friday night. We thought half-naked sexy tatooed girls sounds interestingly exciting naughty fun. I have never seen a show like that ever. We're thinking of checking it out next time they're in town.  We decided to to see  urlLink Bourne Supremacy  instead of the  urlLink Catwoman  (my  urlLink tomato-meter  says it's rotten, the movie was rated so low). We sneaked in some hotdogs, sodas and munchies. Yah, we're pretty cheap like that, haha! We refuse to give our hard-earned $$$ to the concession stand. The movie was great. I haven't read the book so it doesn't really matter if they totally changed the plot (so I heard). It had one of the most exciting car chase I have seen, what a ride!  We had a pretty good day and the weekend wasn't even over yet...
