In my opinion, I would always think of Buffy every time I saw him as the Doctor and that could distract me at first.  I am sure that I could get used to the idea but I wonder.  He is a really great actor especially in his role as Mr. Giles, Librarian and Watcher on the show.  As the show progressed he becamse a father figure for Buffy and then later he became a character who lived in England.  At that point he was no longer one of the main characters but someone who guest starred on the show for a few minutes.  As Giles he really added to the story line at the beginning.  He was the true leader with his books and plans and Buffy was the one who acted them out.  I guess they had to show that Buffy could be on her own and make her own decisions and plans without Mr. Giles.    I just can't see him as the Doctor though even though he is a great actor.
