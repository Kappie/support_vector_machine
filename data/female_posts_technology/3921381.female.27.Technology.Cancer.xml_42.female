Be careful when dealing with others, as a miscommunication is very possible. So long as you keep your eyes and ears wide open, you should be able to calm a storm before it gathers momentum. Others may seem aloof, but realize that it may just be that Cancer sensitivity coming to the forefront. Since family is important at this time, rather than letting your feelings be hurt, retreat instead with the ones you love. No one else really needs to know about your internal conflict. Put it behind you, and move forward."  only rare occasions when horoscopes sometimes do match up with your life.
