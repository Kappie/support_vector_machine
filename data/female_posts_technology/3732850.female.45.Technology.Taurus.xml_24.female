I was full of many emotions from proud, amazed, anxious and wishful but not sad.    I am so proud of my daughter and all of her accomplishments. From her athletic accomplishments to her academic accomplishments. She has experienced some difficult times along with the positive ones but she has learned to persevere. She hasremained a very humble person even though she has so much to be proud of.    Amazing is another word that comes to mind. All of my children have amazed me with their unique personalities and qualities but somehow she is different. She is so thoughtful and compassionate towards others and yet she is still able to meet her ownpersonal needs emotionally. She knows when she needs time for herself but manages to balance those needs with the needs of others.    I am anxious for my daughter because I worry sometimes that sheis missing out on the "fun" things in life. She worries about things that most people her age don't think about. She worries about finances, family obligations, her siblings and her father and I.I remind her often that it is my job to worry about those things, not hers.    I am wishful when I think of my daughter. She has the world by the tail and I wish that when I was her age, I could have been so sure of myself, so independent, so goal oriented. I wish that I had the passion she feels for life and everything in it at such a young age. I will miss her terriblywhen she is away at college, but she is ready to move on to bigger and better things and I can't wait to watch her fly.
