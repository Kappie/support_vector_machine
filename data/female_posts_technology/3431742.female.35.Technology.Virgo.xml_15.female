Hell if I know what the heck IPR is.  I've shipped all kinds of computer equipment to England in the past and was never asked for IPR before.  Of course, I called Airborne/DHL.  They didn't even show it was in Midlands, England as of yet.  GREAT.  Well as of this morning, at 6 am our time, it's showing up there as out for delivery.  The site doesn't but when I called, it was.  Ah.  Received the DVD I was waiting for.  Dinner for Five.  I can't wait to have a Dinner for Five night.  For those that know about the show are more than welcome and for those that don't, you can come too.  Now I just have to figure out when I'm going to have the party.  Suggestions?  Sat was a long day for me.  My boy woke me around 4 am. Yeah I was not happy but I couldn't exactly roll over and fall back asleep either. :( So I was up.  It was also bad day due to allergies.   Got up and did my normal dosage of allergy meds.  So glad that they are not a prescript one.  Did the dutiful oil change on the car.  Granted it was 1k over the recommended 3k limit but at least I got it done.  Had a changed to watch my cute little nephew play baseball.  He's pretty good when he pays attention.  He was being a bit of a slug going on and coming off the field.  Daddy you better start training with that boy! hehe  And yes I took a nap.  It was longer than usual but then again I normally don't get up at 4am on Sat.  Went to Pridefest Sunday.  Yeah this was a day where Summer showed up.  It was bloddy hot!  I wanted to go earlier but shit, there was no way I was going near the lake before 3pm.  OMG was there a ton of goodlooking boys.  Granted most of them were with other boys but it was good eye-candy for me.  Um...Most of the girls had all kinds of face piercings. Yuck!  Was cool to just walk around and see what they all have there for food and goods being sold.  Thanks to my friend Todd for the tixs!  So that's the weekend in a nut shell.  Now I look forward to the Dinner on Thursday.  It will be at PizzaMan.  I hope that is a groovy place for everyone.  Remember to eat out that day - it's Dining Out for Life night so find a  urlLink restaurant .  Now the question de'jour:  Ever want to talk to someone cause you like the sound of their voice?
