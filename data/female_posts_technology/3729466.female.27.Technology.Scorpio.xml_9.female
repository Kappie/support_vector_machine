I know that and what I don't know is why I am still in love with him. I don't know why I am still spending time with him. I might be wasting time in my life, but I am also married. I am separated waiting for my stupid husband to give me a divorce. So I have nothing much to offer him anyway. I can't promise him anything anyway. I must go on with this until who knows...when I am divorced then I will make a decision. I will decide what to do with this man. I don't want to be waiting on him. He might never be divorced and if he does, our life won't be open to the world, it's still going to be a mystery. He won't ever stop seeing his wife because of their baby. Do I want that? Plus, he won't stop talking on the messenger with his girlfriends. He has over 100 girls listed on his messenger. He said he will stop talking to them if we are together, but I am sure this is bullshit. He will be talking to them behind my back.   So, there are a lot of stuff that I know is true and I don't care about any of that right now. I know I am true to him and to myself and that is important. I will wait for his love and dedication to me only. I am sure he loves me and I have been the best thing in his life. He won't find no one like me. I am sure! I can feel that. I can feel that I am really really good to him and he doesn't want to lose me!  Enough of that for now...hehehe I will be back with some more...these are just some thoughts of this wet morning down here....
