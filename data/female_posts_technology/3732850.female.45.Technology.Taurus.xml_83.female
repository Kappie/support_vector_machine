I am a prisoner. I am the soul person responsible for this miserable crime. My crime is leading a life that I can’t seem to break out of. It is a life of being alone, sad and with drawn from the world of a normal person. This life is a cell; I live in it and hide behind it. My cell is the cell of not a normal person would want.   My mind stirs thoughts of being normal. My face has scares from the beatings I took as a child. My dad would get mad when he was drunk and he would beat me til I bleed. The day I became a prisoner and was put in this cell is when I killed my father. My father came home drunk that day and was filled with anger and he went right for me, but this time I took one of his guns and shot him several times til he fell to the floor.    This day I became a prisoner, my miserable crime of killing my father wasn’t a crime but a defense of not getting beat another time. My cell is ten by ten and has a toilet and a bunk bed in it. I sit in my cell day after day and think of that day I became a prisoner. I ponder how I can break out of my cell and think how nice it would be to lead a normal life. But, while I sit in my cell I hide behind these walls and I feel alone, not just not having another inmate in my cell but feeling alone from not being able to experience a normal life.   Ten years have went by and the warden came to my cell and told me I was free for my case was reopened and I was free because I killed my father out of defense. My cell is just a cell now and I am free to be normal now. It is great to be free but I still feel alone because I am scared for life.
