And just so people will know what I’m talking about, this is what I did at the gym today replete with urls (all exercises are done with 3 sets of 20 repetitions unless noted otherwise):   Lat Pulldown  80 lbs   Seated Cable Row  70 lbs.   Back Fly  10 lbs -  or more properly rear lateral raise, which is NOT a back exercise.    Preacher Curl  50 lbs  wrist curl  8lbs 3 sets of 15 reps  Barbell curl  45 lbs – except I’m not using an EZ bar like in the picture; I’m using a flat bar.  I also did Back Hyperextensions (15 lbs) but I haven’t found a good photo of that yet.     James Lileks writes a funny, interesting blog.   Who is he? I don’t know but I found him through other blogger’s websites. He’s responsible for composing that remix of Howard Dean’s “YHEEARG!” speech. Hey, I was reading him before his 20 minutes of internet fame.  His site has more than this bleats; I especially hurt myself reading/looking at his collection of truly awful men’s fashions:  The Dorcus Collection .
