I think I was obsessing over fonts and thinking that if I had a different font my posts would perhaps be more concise, clever, a little wittier and certainly more relevant. Shyeah, right.  Anyway, thankyou to lovely  urlLink Cousin Peter  for his original blog template and inspiration (this is fast turning into an Oscar speech, quit it).  Good old Blogger really, for making it so easy to look clever (HTML-wise, that is).  Anyway, the bottom line is that only the template has changed, the content clearly hasn't and I guess you can expect the usual drivel.  I'm so apolitical, it's not funny. With an election looming and all sorts of talk of Free Trade Agreements and the like this week, I guess I should be taking more notice, but I don't. Is that bad? Is it un-Australian not to care about politics, no I shouldn't lump a whole nation in with my own apathy. That's not fair. It's just that the blandness (read 'right winged') state of politics at the moment, just doesn't cut it for me, I'm afraid.  Initially, I was a tiny bit interested when Mark Latham came onto the scene with the potential for a bit of bluster and ruddy-faced Labor gung-ho, but that's kind of disappeared hasn't it? It seems he's had his initial political fiestiness kicked out of him in the 'be nice, don't make a ruckus' mode of campaigning favoured these days. Yes, just a bit like the American style of campaigning perhaps? So I guess the Free Trade Agreement doesn't exclude our own election.  Anyhoo, I bought an inordinate amount of cheese today. No, seriously I did. I bought two lots of fetta, a 'new' kind of 'smooth' cottage cheese, some cheese slices and a tub of cream cheese. I wonder if I've got some weird calcium deficiency thing going on and it's subconsciously made me stock up on the cheese.  Perhaps it's all the pseudo-ephedrine I've been taking in the form of cold and flu tablets (because I have a cold and not for fun, I might add). Here's a tip though, dont' take cold and flu tablets on an empty stomach, just so you don't freak out your family by going pale and nearly passing out over coffee and biscuits and frightening the small children.
