The one last night on the ceiling of my bedroom, directly over my head while lying in bed - get the fuck out of here I said. Clearly, at that point my ability to communicate with spiders telekinetically was on 11, because it crawled towards the air conditioning duct and disappeared. However, do you think I could still sleep? I kept waking up every 15 minutes imagining that it had come back again and was crawling over my head.  Asshole spider.  Then, the huge motherfucker on the wall near the toilets at work - YUCK.  I went to the toilets upstairs instead.  And dammit, there's nobody around to get rid of it either. So I guess, I'll be going up and down the stairs quite a bit.  And then there's the one that's living in my stinkin' car.  It's been there for about three months now. It lives in the side mirror, although I"ve never seen it.  I've taken that car through the carwash about ten times, and each time, lo and behold its once again made its intricate web all over my stupid side mirror.  What is the point? What are you planning to catch there, idiotic spider? Another car?   How stupid are these spiders? Really. Charlotte's Web was clearly a load of shit. Now, don't get me wrong, I loved that book and I loved Charlotte, but honestly, a COMPLETE work of fiction.  Tell me, there's a whole fucking world of trees and bushes and plants in parks across the whole world to live in where nobody would bother you, but yet, you choose to make your home in someone else's home who clearly hates your guts and the inevitable is that you're going to get squashed unceremoniously, either by a shoe or a broom, or either have the bejesus sprayed out of you by some hideous chemical.  Surely the spider community would have cottoned by now? Why can't the outdoor spiders tell their friends 'Hey buddy, I wouldn't go in there if I were you'.  Maybe the inside spiders are suicidal and want to be killed? Which would make me feel a lot better, although how would they feel when they encounter the nice people, the pseudo-Buddhists who put them in a jar and then take them outside again.  When this happens, do you think the suicidal spider is thinking 'Oh, man! Now I have to try and get inside all over again, why is this happening to me? I really want to kill myself now!'  What is going on?  I blame the media and hormones in the chicken.
