(there is a greater possibility that I will get responded/printed to)  so am I bored. No more IM'ing allowed at work, and now I find that I have nothing to do. It makes for a very, very looooonnnng day.  maybe instead of sitting on my ass and complaining. I should try to work. Novel idea, though it is, it still feels pointless...futile, and generally useless.
