Story is she's an ex, was at the house last night to pick up some stuff, got the wallet and phone without his knowledge, and is wrecking havoc.  We'll see what happens. I told him I would give him the benefit of the doubt at this point and that I am definitely on guard.   He says he'll call me tomorrow to talk about his making me dinner this week.  Important note for the fellas:  THERE IS NO 2/3 DAY CALL RULE!!  If you go out with a woman you like, call her the next day and tell her that.  If you sleep with a woman, call her the next day.  Even if it's to say never mind, at least let her know.   Oh, and most importantly.....DON'T DATE WOMEN MORE THAN 10 YEARS YOUNGER THAN YOU!!!  You'll only regret it, and the worthwhile women won't want to deal with you and the drama of the little girls that won't let go.
