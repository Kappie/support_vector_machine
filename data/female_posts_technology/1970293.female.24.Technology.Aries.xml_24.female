It is the first full moon of the spring.  Time for the celecbration to bring in the summer and everything that goes with that responsibility.  The elves thrive on challenges especially the caring of the trees, plants, flowers, and animal life.  Of course it was getting harder and harder with the meddling of humans always in the way and always going about their business when it wasn't their business!    Timp chuckled over that thought as he settled back against a tree and waited for the festival to begin.  This is the best time of the year when the elves could gather, eat and dance the night away under a bright full moon with the crickets saranating.  It was a wonderful feeling to be united once a year.  He glanced over at the elven maidens across the clearing.  Such beauty in the face of such a challenge this world brings to the elves.  He wondered which beauty might be interested in him.  He sighed.  He should be realistic.  Beauties such as these are never interested in him because he wasn't really a wonder worker.  He was just a watcher.  His job is to watch the humans and to learn as much as possible of their movements and their characters.  When he would find a human who might be a likely candidate to help the elves, he would return with the information for another elf to act in his stead.    He swept his golden brown hair back over his shoulder and leaned against the tree, crossing his feet at the ankles.  His golden eyes wandered over the crowds noticing the different elven clans that had gathered this year.  Even though most clans joined in the celebration, he knew that some never joined or chose not to join due to some inner family politic.    He noticed that the GreenLeafs and the BlueWaters clans had not arrived this year.  It was probably due to the heirs marrying someone else last year instead of marrying each other.  He heard that their excuse was that they didn't love each other so the clans blamed the other for this horrific consequence.    He shook his head.  What utter nonsense, he mused.  From watching the humans, he gathered much information in their interactions.  He agreed with some and others, he thought the elves were better but some times he wondered if there was more than what he was seeing.  He never had a chance to actually talk to a human but maybe this year he might.  He raised his eyebrows at that thought.  It might prove an interesting year.
