What you surround yourself with shapes you and you begin to adapt what you surround yourself with. I've often wondered if this is true? The thoughts in Psychology circles vary and often vacillates between environment, genetics and a mixture of both as being the major determinant of a person's character.  On one hand there are multiple studies of twins separated at birth ending up with similar lives. Same occupation, same name, same habits, even their spouses sometimes ended up being very similar to each other. On the other hand you see so many stories of children from bleak backgrounds overcoming their environment to make a success of themselves.  My psychology teacher back in college once said, that a person's character was akin to music. Music is produced by an instrument as well as by the musician playing it. Now, how do you measure how much of the music is the instrument, and how much the musician?  It is impossible.  I like to think that people can rise above their environment. Without this belief, you leave people with no hope. If all you have been taught is suffering, and all you've been surrounded with is pain, then what's the point of struggling to make something of yourself?  I believe that people can overcome their backgrounds and once a person can think logically, that person can also think critically and not just go on thinking what they've been exposed to.   What does everyone think? What is it ultimately? Nature versus nurture? I like to think that we're like music.
