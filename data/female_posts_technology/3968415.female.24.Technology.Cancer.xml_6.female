In my previous projects, I owned portions/ modules of the project.  My first project,I was the APL and owned 3 modules.  My second project, i owned another 3 modules.  And this one, i basically owned nothing. In this phase, I have no role to play. I am not in a position to push the messed up project. I dun feel that i am contributing to the progress. I am not used to take on such a passive role. This is driving me mad.   Feeling a little lost. I am basically working on MISC items.   Should i "jump ship" to another project to take on a bigger role?  I feel like i am stagnant-ing here.I might just rot and vegetate.  I mean what am i to write in my appraisal next year.   I dun want to be like those forgotten workers -->Swept under the carpet and FORGOTTEN!    *I DUN WANT TO BE FORGOTTEN*    ~fear~
