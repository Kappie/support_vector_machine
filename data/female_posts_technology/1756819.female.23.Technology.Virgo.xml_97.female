All the wives were like extreme Martha Stewart's, immaculate houses, always cooking and cleaning and waiting on their husbands and children hand and foot.  At one point Nicole Kidman's character bakes about 5,000 cupcakes because she is trying to get into the whole 'Stepford thing'.  Another great one is the book club.  The woman read a book about decorating for the holidays and the entire discussion is centered around how you can use pinecones in your decorations.  Completely ridiculous :)
