Early evening with the sun just starting to say good night and the animals are going to sleep or waking up was her favorite time of day.  She sat down on a rock beside the stream.  She took a deep breath and looked around.  This time is often called the gate between worlds as though there were different worlds that one can move between from one to the other.  She smiled at that thought though she couldn't deny the fact that sometimes weird things seem to happen at dusk.  It seemed the world was holding its breath during the eerie silence.  She sighed before getting up and filling up the bucket with fresh water.  Her light auburn hair slid slowly into her eyes blinding her vision.  She shoved it back just as she saw a deer heading down for water on the other side of the stream.   She froze even though she sat in an awkward position holding a bucket in the water with her back arched.    It was so beautiful with gold brown hair and big brown eyes.  It was a doe.  Tran looked into the forest to see if there was a fawn but she couldn't see any.  The moment between the worlds passed and the night grew darker.  She was sorry she had to move and startle the doe but they would be calling for her soon if she didn't head back now.  She slowly picked up the full bucket and swiveled on her feet.  Watching behind her, she moved slowly away and the doe seemed to either not notice or not care.  After putting ten feet in between, Tran moved at a more normal pace and kept close watch on the darkened path ahead of her.  She didn't want to lose her water and have to get more which would make her very late indeed.     To Eris
