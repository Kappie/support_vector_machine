I really wonder how the people with hundreds of invitations manage to get it all done! I suppose they have invitation assembly parties or something, justifying their absurdly large number of attendents. (I find myself thinking of the wedding Buck and I went to of a coworker of his. She apparently invited 350 people! Dude!)
