Snatches of conversation, the beep-beep of vehicles along Gil Puyat, the sway of branches ahead, the multitude of colors.  I feel the muscles of my face lifting.  At that moment I was happy.  Lost.  Invisible.  Content to be part of a streaming body going god knows where.   "Quite early on I discovered the overlooked space open to those of us with a silent life. I didn't argue with the policeman who said I couldn't cycle over a certain bridge or through a specific gate in the fort - I just stood there, still, until I was invisible, and then I went through.  Like a cricket.  Like a hidden cup of water.  You understand?  That is what my brother's public battles taught me." - Kip,  The English Patient  -
