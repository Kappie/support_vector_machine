Then comes the "shaz and waz show" (yuck whatta name!) where people are actually asked to poll for the PYT they wanna see during the lunch break...   i mean...WHY??? they're here to pull the men, surely. MEN?? But when did men ever need to be forced to watch cricket? Not the ones in the sub-continent atleast. So what purpose do they serve?? Men will watch cricket anyday ,pretty women or not. Don't tell me they're here to draw in the women. Please!       I'm a huge cricket fan but the minute i see these PYT's in designer costumes haw and hum in front of the camera, i'm surely inclined to change the channel. Gimme the game please.I wouldn't have a problem, in fact i'd love it if we have knowledgeable women doing live commentary while the game is on. Not the way it is right now.   So...what's the deal,why really?? It cud be:    a) To attract men who don't watch cricket...hmm..distant possibility? heck no!   b)To keep the cricket fans glued to the sets even during the break. hmmmm?? that must be it....      Whatever the reason,point is the game is gettin too commercialised. A request : Please leave test match cricket untouched .Please . Its our only hope. Its all we got. Amen.
