I didn’t eat anything else until supper time. I had some strawberries and raspberries, and then chicken souvlaki with no bun, and some rice and tomatoes. I ate some more melba toast later and a piece of cheese. I did two pilates tapes back to back, so that makes for about 50 mins. of exercise. I did not, however, drink enough water. I woke up this morning with mega pasty mouth. Oh, and I should point out that late Saturday night I ate the stupid ice cream sandwich, AND some licorice. I do feel guilty, but it was so good.           I really beat myself up about it on Sunday, until I realized – that’s the only “junk food” that I had for an entire week! Even though I made little slip ups here and there, I am still proud of myself. I worked out five days this week, which is at least two more days than I would have without you guys. Thanks!          This week I have decided to replace the breakfast shake with a coffee (since I wasn’t eating breakfast before this) to cut out some calories. I also think I’m going to try and up the workout to at least an hour five days a week instead of half an hour. My new motivation is having to wear a bathing suit in front of coworkers in less than a month. (Camping trip.) No offense, but thank heavens Bryan isn’t going! He doesn't need to see my chubby thighs.        Hey, guess what!! My weekly weigh-in suggests I've lost 2 lbs!! Woo hoo!
