Clemens asked to leave after arguing call Story  --> Houston  Astros  pitcher  Roger Clemens  was asked to leave a youth baseball game over the weekend for arguing a close call that went against his son's team. Photo gallery urlLink Week in baseball   urlLink   Clemens was at the game Saturday watching his son, Kacy, compete in a 10-and-under game organized by Triple Crown Sports when Clemens contested a call at second base that went against the Katy Cowboys. He spit sunflower seeds at an umpire's leg and was asked to leave, said Jim Carpenter, a field supervisor with Triple Crown. "I supported the umpire's decision and he (Clemens) respectfully left," Carpenter told the Craig Daily Press. Katy lost the game to the Bakersfield Curve, 11-5. Triple Crown Sports features a franchise system aimed at pitting top teams from across the country against each other. Clemens' agent, Randall Hendricks, did not immediately return a call Monday. Clemens has racked up 322 wins and 4,240 strikeouts in his 21-year major league career.
