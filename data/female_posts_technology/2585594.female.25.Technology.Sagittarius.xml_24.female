I get out my digicam and video the morning-after scene. And then Diane gets up and goes to take a shower as Jaz comes out all fresh, albeit having slept at 430 am. And the time is just 8 am, or probably a few minutes earlier. Hehehe.  So people get up, and start having breakfast (tira-tira from the night before). I take my shower, and when I come out, everyone's up. Sleep overtakes me and I lie down to nap for a while. I wake up and the house is abuzz. Everyone's ready to go and Hensy goes 'Allan, ligo ka na, 1030 na.' I sit up and say 'Ha? E naligo na ko, kanina pa no.' Hehehe. And then everyone helps clean up the mess we made and the mommies in the house (i.e. Diane, Barre, Denise, and me) make sure no things are left behind by people. And then we leave. Mammee Barre and Daddy-O Hensy decide that lunch will be at Barley's Creek (place suggested by snowboarding coach Dave the night before).   But before we head on up there, we look for a place to do our snowtubing thing. We go to Alpine Ski blah-blah place. And we see that there is no snowtubing going on there. However, me and Babygurl find that kids (yes, kids --- ages 3-6, we're guessing) are snowboarding and skiing down the slopes and we say 'Kaya rin natin 'yan o' and started blaming the condition of the snow on our snowboarding slopes the day before. We are laughable heheh. But then we leave because every single person's body is aching fromt he day before. And then we head to barley Creek for lunch.  Sidebar: Everyone is hungry but no one gets food, all in anticipation of a sumptuous lunch. But Mammee could not wait, and finally overcome, had to take in something. So she went for some leftovers. And as she offered some to Daddy-O, we got to the place. Hahaha. Blame it on Mammee's low EQ, she said.  Lunch was very good (i say this in comparison to yesterday's lunch ha, which was blech cafeteria food). took a few pictures outside, and headed for the car. But no! Steven almost goes into another van, filled with Americans. He mistakes it for ours. Nyahahaha.   And then came the snowtubing place. We parked, passed by the tunnel (very, very cool, if I may say so) and we are transported to snow's version of Christmas. Hehehe. We sign the forms, pay our dues, and are divided into 3 groups. The other 2 groups try the family tubes first, btu my group (Daddy-O, Babygurl, Teban, and moi) go off into the single snowtubes. It was a blast!!!!! Ang saya-saya (clap-clap-clap, in the tradition of Mads). After 3 successful times (except for Babygurl who kept slowing down or stopping on her slope), we decide it's time for the family tubes. While at the line, we see the other folks single tubing, one by one, and we try to identify who's going down. And then, we see someone who (a-la slow motion on tv) t-u-m-b-l-e-s a-s h-e-r t-u-b-e c-o-m-e-s o-u-t f-r-o-m u-n-d-e-r h-e-r. Oh no, I was thinking it was Mads. And if my eyesight served me right, the person tumbled once in the air, and tumbled again on the ground before she caught ehrself. And then, she stood up, and went over to her naughty tube and walked down. As she stood up, all four of us said 'A, si Poch'. hehehe. It was awesome. Something to tell her kids one day, I bet.  And so we snowtubed once. And the exhiliration from the speed! OMG!!!!! Grabe, wala akong masabi.   And then we had an idea. Race!!!!!!!!!!!  We challenged the other group --Mads, Cha, Barre, and Poch. Game daw, game. Hehehe.  As we went up, my group was stategizing. And the other group was, well, having fun. And we had another brilliant idea! Video the slide! And so we did. We told the 'pushers' our plan, and they said 'okay'. One, Two, three, GO! All four of us faced the front of the snowtube, and when the tube went sideways, we all jumped to face the new front of the tube. It was soooo funny because we were so caught up in the moment. And we won, but we found out that Poch had made a scene while they were going down..... Cha, Mads, and Mammee Barre were all at the front of the tube to make it go faster, but Poch was at the back, clinging for dear life and screaming, 'Ayoko pa mamatay, tumalembang na ko kanina!!!! Ayoko na tumalembang'....... Hahahahaha. Everyone was laughing while Poch was on the verge of crying from her near-death experience. And so they switched Poch with Xian. And we still won!!!!!!!!!  The third time, we exchanged slopes, because they said our slope was steeper which resulted in us going faster. We begged to disagree. But the 'pusher' made a mistake and it was a false start, and so we didn't have much push so they won. Blagh! Two out of three still makes us a winner! Nyahahaha.  And then we were on our way home. Denise gives us the low-down of what she does and does not like in a man. And then some. Hehehe. Alternating between sleep and wakefulness, we got back to Arlington and said our goodbyes. All of our bodies aching like hell, but all of our memories intact.   Nice one!
