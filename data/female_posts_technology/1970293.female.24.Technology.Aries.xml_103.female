A little less threatening and more welcoming with a little sun filtering through the trees and the sounds of the animals foraging for food.  "Morning."  Morrigan said as she stretched slowly.  Stiff from sleeping on the hard ground all night and from running for the last few days.    "Morning, sleepyhead."  Aidan came over and kissed her on the nose before handing her some nuts and berries.  "Strange thing.  I found the nuts and berries on some leaves this morning."  "The elf must have spoke true last night about helping us though I doubt the elves left the food.  Most likely it was one of the other fair folk.  We must leave some token of our appreciation."  Morrigan smiled as she chewed on the nuts.    "So we are granted sanctuary while we stay in this forest as long as we obey the laws. So tell me Morrigan.  I have been meaning to ask.  Can anyone learn the craft or are only certain people allowed?"  Morrigan watched Aidan stretch his arms to the sky hungrily gazing at his body.  "Anyone can study the craft.  Like if you wanted, I could teach you the lore and you would be able to create a globe of light like I did last night."  Morrigan answered quickly before eating a few berries.  "Okay but why are you so special since anyone can learn it?"  Aidan looked intently into her eyes.  "Because my family are considered natural witches.  While it is nice to know the lore it isn't needful for us to perform magical tasks."  Morrigan finished by gathering their belongings together.  "I was wondering if you could teach me the craft.  I mean I doubt I will ever have the power you have but I would like to understand it better.  I mean I heard all the stories so I am sure I have a few biases but learning will clear any ignorances up quickly."  Aidan said as he took his pack from her and squeezing her hand.  "I would love to teach you the lore.  The first part is very easy of course.  It's all stories about the fair folk and the beginnings of the craft.  But for now, let's reach our destination before the fair folk shoo us through the forest for taking too long."  Morrigan giggled as she suddenly tagged Aidan and took off running.  "Catch me if you can."  Morrigan heard Aidan laughed before pounding after her.  She giggled and spoke the words of camouflage.  She slowly faded into the background until to the untrained eye, she was gone from sight.    She watched Aidan stop suddenly and look around closely.  "You're cheating."  Aidan yelled as he turned in a circle looking for her.  She tapped his shoulder, giggling as she hopped out of the way.    Suddenly she felt his arms around her squeezing her tight against his body.  "I got you now, minx."   "How did you find me?"  Morrigan asked breathlessly.  "Remember I used to hunt for the village plus I have very good eyesight and hearing."  Morrigan turned in his arms, spoke the words to undo the spell, watching his grin spread wider as she appeared before him.  "I should have remembered that but at least now I know the ability of spells working around you."  She squeezed him tightly.  "We better be moving though.  All too soon it will be dark again and we must reach that cabin the elf spoke about."  They walked for a long period of time before taking a rest to eat and drink from a small stream that passed through the forest.  The cool refreshing water seemed to revive their energy, helping them to continue their journery for a few more hours.   Nope
