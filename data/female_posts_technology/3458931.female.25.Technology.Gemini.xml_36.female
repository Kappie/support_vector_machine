On Friday I packed the camping gear and headed out to the cottage. With my aunt, uncle, and two cousins visiting sleeping space in the cottage was at a premium, so Jasmin and I setup the cots and sleeping bags and slept in the tent. Our supper on Friday was interrupted by a local woman who wanted to ensure we were aware of the bears in the area, and for us not to have any food with us in the tent. Needless to say my sleep was a bit restless. My dad made us feel a bit more secure by ensuring the fire outside the tent was smoldering and smoking for most of the night, and mom supplied us with pots and spoons to bang for scaring away any clawed invaders.      It was terrific to see my aunt Judy again and converse with someone within my own family interested in environmental and social causes. We shared opinions on home schooling vs. the public system, and protesting with action vs. protesting with intellect.     On Saturday I made Chinese food for the whole gang and the four younger girls in the family entertained us with a movie they had made. Maybe I'm getting old and sappy already but hanging out with family was pretty cool.     I had to leave today with some very stern words for Jasmin, as she's been acting up aggressively towards my brother. I don't know how we're going to control this, I don't know if the drugs are making it better or worse. I'm going to have to make another call to Dr. Stickles, and perhaps make a plea to mental health to get Jasmin to see a professional sooner than planned.  Oh, and I think my cat has a limp. Is the weekend really over?
