First let me say that I really like Ben Affleck as an actor.  He has done pretty good work in the past, and I enjoy the film projects that he has worked on.  I even liked seeing him as part of Project Greenlight.  To see what really goes on behind the scenes to make a movie, even a low-budget film, was fascinating.  I wonder what it would be like to play no-limit Texas Hold'em with Ben.  I have a hard enough time playing poker against Grandma, because lying is just not part of my psyche.  I've been watching the World Series of Poker for about five years now, and soaking up all the suddenly-popular World Poker Tour and Celebrity Poker Tour and all those other poker shows.  I really enjoy gambling.  But what would it be like to sit across the table from Ben Affleck?  An average person, or one who has never made it to the final tables, would probably be intimidated.  You know that he knows how to play, you know that he has money to burn and that he's just doing it for fun.  For a pro, who plays for a living, it must be frustrating.  Here comes this guy, lots of money to kill, just out for a nice time.. tromping and stomping all over your hard work.  I guess this doesn't apply to just Ben, it would be any celebrity or famous person who has lots of money.    Of course, the likes of Stan Goldstein and Phil Helmuth have won plenty of tournaments and I'm sure they have lots of money to buy in to $10k and $25k tournaments.  But this, not acting, is their job.  It is how they make their living.  I think I'd feel a little squished if a celebrity came into my line of work and started doing it better, beating me at my own game... Literally.  Well, good luck Ben.  I hope you make it into the final few tables in Vegas next April, because I'd love to watch you play in the winner's circle!
