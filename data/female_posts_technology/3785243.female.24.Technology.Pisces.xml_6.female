I've been really interested in the culture of the Middle East (particularly Morocco), and thought I would include a contribution from this area of the world.  Many thanks to  urlLink this source  for posting and providing samples and a nice analysis of the themes in such beautiful poetry.  -- Aeryth  FAREWELL, by Ibn Jakh (11th century, Andalusian)  translated by Emilio Garcia Gomez  Cola Franzen.  On the morning they left we said goodbye filled with sadness for the absence to come.     Inside the palanquins on the camels' backs I saw their faces beautiful as moons behind veils of golden cloth.     Beneath the veils tears crept like scorpions over the fragrant roses of their cheeks.     These scorpions do not harm the cheek they mark. They save their sting for the heart of the sorrowful lover.
