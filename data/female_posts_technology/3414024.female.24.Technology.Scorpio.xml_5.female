Menu for the last two days: Strawberries  Snow Peas Broccoli Sprouts (radish  clover) Avocado (today only)  None of this is eaten cooked, and although it ideally would be organic- it isn't.  For a little bit of back history on why I choose to torture myself this way ;-) I've been quite active the last three weeks running anywhere from 4-8 miles a day, and cycling hard for an hour or so on occasion... And it came to my attention that though I was looking a bit different, I wasn't necessarily seeing the results as quickly as I'd like. Now, I do realize that there are a number of drawbacks to whatever it is here that I'm doing. Firstly, a noticeable decrease in my available energy. I basically snack all day, eating when I'm hungry (which is about every two hours, and it takes me a good half hour or so to nibble a handful of broccoli, a 1/2 cup of sprouts, 3 snow peas, etc). The reduction in energy I'm assuming is largely due to the lack of complex carbohydrates that I typically ingest on a daily basis. Fair enough. Now, what I keep forgetting about is that when you drastically change your diet to include easily raw and/or organic foods (read: non-toxic) foods the body will start eliminating said toxins from the body thus imparting upon yourself bouts of horrid yuckiness. By stating this I'm merely trying to imply that I don't feel so good.
