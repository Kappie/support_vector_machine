Today I looked at some pictures from my cousin's wedding and I look like a gothic clown. My bangs are black, stringy, and in my eyes and I'm wearing all dark clothes except this incongruously bright pink and white vinyl flower pin attached to my sweater. It looks like a cheap clown ploy, like it will squirt water at any minute -- black, inky, gothic water. I would be very happy if instead of my image being represented by this horrific monstrous strangely-dressed woman, I had a "Prince" symbol. He's not using it anymore because he's going by his name, so I figure it can crop up in pictures to represent something new, namely, me.  2.  The banana picture.  On Friday, I was in a weird silly mood so I just marched over and stuck it on his cube wall. He seemed pretty jazzed about it and he didn't kick me out or stab me or stomp me into the ground. He did not spit in my face or slap me either. He actually took it and hung it in a more prominent position: on his banana tree. That sounds kind of perverse, but it is one of those kitchen apparatuses that you use to hang your bananas on. It is a base, a shaft of curved wood, and at the tip is a hook where you hang your vagina, er, bananas. It is very Ron Popeil-esque. Why he has it on his desk is not a mystery to me, but a profound head-and-heart-spinning wonder. If I didn't hate being in this office so much, the sight of a banana tree on a desk would make me giggle. So now when I pass by and see my drawing displayed so openly, I feel a tinge of glee and pride to see a part of me accepted into his cube, his office-life. That is 40 hours of the week. That is 40 hours a week that he gets to gaze upon my most righteous depiction of a bunch of bananas.
