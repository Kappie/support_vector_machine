This evening I noticed some kind of bizarre red rash that looks and feels like a sunburn, except only in one oval on my shoulder.  It's about 4 inches by 2 inches.  I had elaborate plans to use the gym membership my loving boyfriend got me and work out tonight, but the rash is irritated by the clothes that I would have to wear exercising.  There's no way I'm going to put myself in that much discomfort.  I don't even know what to put on this thing to make it better.    My friend John crossed a Turkish bridge from Europe to Asia yesterday and  urlLink is writing  about touring ancient ruins and artifacts.  I'm talking about a rash.  Hardly compares.
