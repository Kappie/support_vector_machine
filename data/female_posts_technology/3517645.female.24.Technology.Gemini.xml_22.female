I tried to stay up to watch the Amazing Race, which comes on at 11pm, but there was a thunderstorm and the rain was insane, which made our satillite go out of wack so we couldn't get a signal anyways. so off to bed I went. I had a good sleep until about 1am, then the kids both came in and it was all down hill from there. I am sure they had a great sleep all cuddied between duane and I. The lightening last night was pretty cool, especially when I drove across the bridge to get home from work. I love thunder and lightening storms. In saint john we hardly ever got them, but here in fredericton at least once a week you see lightening.   I am now studying for my next exam. Only three more and then I get a bonus, whoo. But what sucks about getting the bonus it that the government takes almost half before I even see it. which is crazy cause I have to work hard for that bonus. all well that is the way it works and we can't do much about it.
