       
      We're down to 7 working days until our live date (although I don't think the term "weekend" will have much significance, other than dress code), so I doubt I'll have much time for blogging in the next week or so.  Just giving advanced notice so I don't get overwhelmed with guilt and feel the need to apologize later...
