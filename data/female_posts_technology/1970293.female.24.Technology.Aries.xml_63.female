Her skin the color of sand and her hair the color of wet sand when first touched by the morning sun.  Her lips full and dark like a sand dune at night with the moon shining brightly.  He blinked as he felt his horse slip on loose sand.  He pulled up on the reins slowly the horse until he caught his balance.  He knew he looked like a shadow to anyone who saw him crossing the desert.  His dark horse matched his dark clothing and hair.  He was a true desert nomad.  His desert rose would have the only chance of settling him down for any length of time.  Why else would he be rushing back to her soft golden arms.  He urged his horse on.  His hooves kicking up the sand behind causing a dust cloud that followed behind.    He thought of holding her slender body tightly against his.  She was the only beauty that would ever warm his blood like she.  Even the desert couldn't stir his blood like she.  She was his soul, his life, his heart.  He would die if she ever left him for how could he live without his source of life.    All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003
