This weekend was a short weekend for us because he didn't stay with me Saturday night and Sunday all day. He came to my place around 5 pm on Sunday. Then he laid down on the sofa and stayed there most of the time while I was doing some school work. We watched 2 movies I went to get him at blockbuster, ate dinner and went to bed around midnight. I never go to bed early when he is there. He stays awake late every night. I can't go to sleep because he has that TV on volume high. Men....they are all the same...but I can't live without them...I love men! I love my man!  Anyway, not much to say. One thing he did yesterday that I didn't like, but it is my fault, is that he logged in into his messenger and one of his girlfriends was online with a message, "Visit my website!". Curious like he is, he clicked on it and there it was, this girl's website with her pictures like a model, a trying-to-be-porn-model. Then I was telling him that he likes her and that he tells her she is beautiful...and he told me that was not true...and we almost got on an argument...I am so stupid. That was my moment to tell him to go home and use his computer to see that type of crap. But because I am better than this shit, I decided to shut my mouth and go to sleep. His time will come. My chance to be through with him will come. I am sure. I am patient. I am going no where. He can't go anywhere. I am getting stronger and learning each day.  Let me get back to work...
