They were holding a sale for items that were in storage.The owner stopped paying their storage fees, moved, or the item were repossessed for inability to pay rent. I came across a picture of an older lady. From the looks of the frame and the clothes that the lady wore, it was from the seventies. I wondered too if she had had family or had passed away and this was what was left of her. I felt saddened at the thought of this picture sitting up against the table, on the floor, dirty. Where were her daughters and sons? Why would they let a picture of her mother lay there like that?    When Julie mentions “If they had family – that’s the one that sticks in my throat- if they had family, could they be this forgotten, this neglected”, this saddened me. I am from a close family and this made me think that I am fortunate and blessed.    The last paragraph brings to my mind how we sometimes will judge others, come to conclusions, and stereotype or assume things before we know and see the whole  picture .
