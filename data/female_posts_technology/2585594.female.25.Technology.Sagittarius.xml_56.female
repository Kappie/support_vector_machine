Only I know that I have become a topic. A TOPIC.   Not a person, but a thought put into words. That's all I am, apparently.  In one, I'm one of the really genuine girls he quickly  fell in love with; in the other, I am the evil witch who pretended to be the fairy-tale princess; in the last, ... well, that's for me to know and for you to find out (ha ha).  Anyway, nobody really cares what they think of me except me so it's not such a big deal for you, I know.   Five minutes from now, when I kiss my boyfriend, I really won't care too.  Feisty.   Rarrr.
