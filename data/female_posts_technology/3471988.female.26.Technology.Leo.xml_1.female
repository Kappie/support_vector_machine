At the moment, Bangalore has a very pleasant weather and, I am sure that you will enjoy it, which probably will suit you anyway!  Southern India almost always has a much better weather and less polluted when compared to the likes of North India. However, I do not know whether you have visited India before. If this is your very first visit to India, for a start, you might find it culturally shocking, and also the sea of people...! But, you will surely get to know of the various traditions, practices etc being followed here. Of course, you will also love the spiritualistic part of life here..I am sure!  And, what about the food here...its gorgeous, you will love all the authentic Indian Spicy Food! and you can enjoy your Beer as well... :)  You will never be among strangers here. Bangalore is one of those cities in India where you are treated in a very homely manner, people are quite hospitable and will go out of their way to please others, especially westerners just like you. I hope to tell you more once you reach Bangalore!  Activities, you can do whatever you want to, like long-walks, visiting places (there are lots of historical, ecological places that you could visit)based from Bangalore, and of course, you are surely invited to visit my own home for some sumptuous south Indian Food.  I work as an Associate Consultant for a UK based software company called RebusIS that recently opened their branch office in Bangalore.Previously I was based near New Delhi. I will obviously look forward to having our first "Masala Chai" !  I wish you a pleasant journey to India and once again, extend you a very warm welcome.  PS. once you arrive at the Bangalore International Terminal, please do not worry about the huge crowd at the Customs/Immigration counters...There are not too many, anyway you will be glad to know that there are no mosquitos anymore :) The Airport has now been re-furbished and quite nice too, although a bit small for an international Airport.   Have a good day.  Regards, Gopal  Hi Cecille,  Thanks for your reply and good to know that you will be in Bangalore very soon. Intel is a very good and well known company in Bangalore and is one of the top MNC's in Bangalore. India itself is a beautiful place with diverse cultures, religions and languages. The languages spoken in Bangalore are hindi, kannada, tamil and english.  Bangalore is now becoming too crowded, especially the traffic. It has got a good weather and now a days it is raining quite  bit. Bangalore is known as the garden city as it has got a lot of nice gardens.  Bangalore is also called the pub city as there are a lot of pubs in bangalore. Bangalore is also known for different kinds of hotels and restaurants, mainly chinese, thai, indian, mugalai, andhra you name it you find it here including the KFC and the pizza hut.  New comers like you should be careful while travelling after 9 in the evening and should avoid travelling alone. The auto or taxi drivers will try to fleece you when they know you are new to the city. By the way where will you stay in Bangalore ?  Otherwise the people are very friendly and will help and assist you when ever you need it.    My sister lives in Portland but don't know where exactly as I have not been there and my other sister lives in Dallas. She too is coming to india next week.  I would like the idea to share a cup of "chai" with you and exchange cultures.  My sisters name in Portland is Jennifer and the other is Matilda who stays in Dallas.  Good to know that you are from Philippines as I had a friend too who was from Philippines.  Take care and hope to see you. If you need any help in Bangalore you can contact me on 98440-15737 and I work for a mobile service provider company called Spice Telecom.  Bye for now, Best wishes, Richard
