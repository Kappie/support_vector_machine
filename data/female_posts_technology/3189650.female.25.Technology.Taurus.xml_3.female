      " The next best thing to being witty oneself, is to be able to quote another's wit " -- Christian Nestell Bovee  This happens with me all the time. Every time I chance upon a witticism, I try to file it away in my memory, to be able to sound witty and interesting the next time I am in distinguished company. But as Sherlock Holmes said,  "I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose.....It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before." So I thought that before I forget how to write code (which definitely would be a catastrophe), I had better take out some furniture from the attic and put it on public display.  Disclaimer : I am not responsible for any wear and tear/depreciation in value that may have occured when it was gathering dust in the attic.  There was a graffiti event in office, not exactly free-form, basically teasers people had to complete with catchy one-liners. Some of the funniest ones were:   Venus Dates Sun and says...  ... " you are HOT! " ... " let's go for an eclipse! " ... " give me red! " ... " let's not worry about the Mercury between us! "   No one is listening until you...  ... " stop talking! " ... " scream 'Fire!' " ... " remove their headphones!' " ... " wake them up!' " ... " shout 'Chocos on my desk!' "  Got a funnier one yourself? Doooooo lemme know!  And here 's what R.K.Narayan said while discoursing about restaurants in one of his short essays.  "Written on the epitaph of a waiter, 'God finally caught his eye.' "    Parting Shot  : " Writing is a lot like sex.At first you do it because you like it.Then you find yourself doing it for a few close friends and people you like.But if you're any good at all...you end up doing it for money.

      What's common between The Day After Tomorrow, Lakshya and Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar? Just that I happened to see all three in a span of the last three days.  Bunked work on Friday afternoon to watch The Day After Tomorrow. Did not feel too bad about it because I doubt that I would have achieved much had I been sitting at my desk instead. I love Friday afternoons, at least I can blame the unwillingness to work on the approaching weekend! The story and the characters were cliched (there is only so much you can do by the way of a storyline in a film about the repercussions of global warming), and had it not been for the _AWESOME_ special effects, i would have been really disappointed. But I am sure it wasn't entirely the air-conditioning that sent shivering tingles of fear and cold by my spine more than a few times during the movie. And I guess what will clinch the case for the credibility of the amazing behind-the-scenes work is that I was actually glad to feel the too-familiar heat of the Delhi sun trying to roast me alive when we came out afterwards.   "Thank God for the heat and the sun!"  was what most of us were saying. Temporary madness, you say? I say, I much rather prefer it to the terrifying tornadoes and hailstorms hell-bent on flattening everything in their way!  Lakshya.. saw it for the second time (the first time on 70 mm, can't believe the screen at PVR is that wide though, maybe it isnt! what say you?), and enjoyed it more than the first time, despite the fact that we could get tickets only for the front row and I had to keep looking slightly to the left all throughout to get a good view of the screen(which incidentally made the cozy couple sitting next to me feel that I was more interested in THEM than the movie!). Besides, I discovered why the PVR guys give you a slight discount on the front-row tickets(esp if they are right next to the exit). It is their way of showing appreciation for your bravado, grit and good humor in letting people of all shapes and sizes step on your toes all throughout the three hours or so, who then walk past with the superior expression of dudette-i-cant-help-it-you-know-its-all-your-fault-you-agreed-to-sit-where-you-did-and-heres-another-stamp-for-your-folly-OUCH!-that-will-teach-you-to-sit-on-your-sorry-asses-at-home-the-next-time-rather-than-obstructing-my-way-when-i-go-out-to-pee.   Another highlight of the evening was that Murali Karthik (now don't go, 'Murali who?') was there too to watch the movie. I thought he looked really familiar when he passed me by for the first time and when I zoomed in on the neckband, I knew I was in the presence of one of the men in blue. So, the one upside of getting a seat just inches away from the screen AND the exit was that I got to have a real good look at him twice or thrice, and I must say that he had impeccable manners to not step on my dainty toes either. If you are wondering why I am going on an on about a relatively small fry, it is because seeing a celebrity, however minor, in person brings out the innate snob in me. A whiff of glamour and I am transformed into an ogle. I conveniently forgot the many times when I have passed various kinds of uncharitable remarks about him/the entire team, particularly during tight, everybody-is-on-tenterhooks matches. All I could do was stare and stare and stare and think about the quantity and nature of embellishments I would make to the event before letting everybody in the world (oh well, everybody in my world, that is) know of it. At one point in time, I was even thinking of going up to him and asking for an autograph. But then, better sense prevailed.  Jo Jeeta Wahi Sikandar, well, this is the umpteenth time I saw the movie, and though Aamir Khan,Pooja Bedi, Ayesha Julka and most of the rest of the cast looked too jaded to be still in school, I still couldn't stop myself from having that lumpy, choked-up feeling inside my throat when Aamir wins the race in the end.  And hey, I got a digicam for myself!! YAYYYYYYYYYYY! Its a decent 3.2 meg camera, suitable enough for personal use, and something that I wanted to acquire since a year. Most of Saturday evening and night were spent in examining and exploring its various features and screaming with delight each time I figured out something new. Today was spent in clicking photographs left, right and center, with absolute disregard to aesthetics, and with the sole purpose of trying out as many new features as possible. Considering that I am as good in fiddling with electronic stuff as I am in bungee-jumping, being able to connect the camera to the comp without a glitch and downloading pics from it was the highlight of my day.   Oh, and I had a fright earlier when despite my following the instructions in the user manual to the T, the camera didn't switch on. Several minutes of informed and uninformed opinions from every member of my family, ranging from the helpful ' Let me try once na! ' to the patriotic ' Didn't I tell you not to ask XXX to get it from the UK, none of this trouble would have occured if you had got it from a local shop!'  ensued. Then I decided that we (the camera and I) can't take the abuse any longer. So I called up the friend who bought the camera for me and told him of my predicament. We tried to explore the various reasons the trouble may have been caused due to, and after much brainstorming, decided to start again from scratch and follow verbatim the procedure for switching on the camera as mentioned in the user guide, one step at a time.   After we were more than halfway through and I was getting increasingly despondent because ' I did exactly the same thing yaar! ' (I even thought that there was something to the theory of foreign stuff refusing to work properly here.), my friend goes ' hey, i hope you used the batteries which were in the camera case '. I was like ' huh? what batteries in the camera case? I am using the ones which came bundled with the charger. '. Friend : ' stupid, the ones with the charger are obviously new, uncharged ones, use the charged ones in the camera case '.   I credit him for being able to speak the whole sentence before dissolving into fits of laughter, which were initially  amusing, but when I remembered the fact that my friends possess a phenomenally long memory when it comes to goof-ups like these from one of the gang and that this would ensure that I am the butt of many other chauvinistic jokes for at least a couple of months from now on, my sense of humour took a downward dip and has been steadily diminishing since.  Oh, what wouldn't I give for a bout of selective amnesia, to the people who matter!

      (does this happen with you too?)  I have this maddening habit of misplacing anything "that can be misplaced" (Hima's law : ' Anything that can be misplaced, will be misplaced ').  Be it my cellphone (the most frequent victim), handbag (yes, i am perfectly capable of misplacing something as big as that), an important document(like annual bank statements, ATM and other receipts, client sign-off mails, payslips, tax returns.. ad nauseum), a book/mag i desperately want to read, a dress i want to wear to work next morning(it is another matter that the dress would be in no shape to be thus honoured even if i manage to find it).   So anytime I am in such a fix, I wish Microsoft had come out with a  "Find Critical Stuff You Were Crazy Enough to Misplace and Find It in the Efficient, Scalable and Reusable Way Of The-Saviours-of-the-World at Microsoft"  software in real life too, simulating the cant-do-without "Find Files or Folders" Windows has blessed my PC with.   As it doesnt take much effort, I shall now proceed to enhance this wish into a full-fledged flight of fancy.   Here's how version 1.0 of the FSYWCEM TM  is intended to work:   ('To','And', 'Will', 'Microsoft' and the rest of the sales pitch are very common words and hence were not included in the acronym)  Say the name of the offending entity that had the audacity to disappear just when you wanted it the most. The sound waves reach your brain (which has just been upgraded with a 10 gig processor) via an in-built powerful sensor. Your brain processes this input furiously (Warning : A slightly distracting whirring sound may be heard at this point in time, if the item being searched was discarded before a couple of months or more.) and digs up the location of your lost treasure from its least-used recesses where you banished it with the other presumably useless information.  And the Good Lord Be Praised! A voice booms :(audible only to yourself, whaddya think, or else i would be banned from all public places!),   "The red halter-neck is lying at the bottom of your wardrobe,where you left it at 15.07.2004 01:15:09 IST."   A tad taciturn and rather impersonal, i agree, but hey, it is v1.0 after all! Remember 'good ol' Windows 3.1?   The new and improved FSYWCEM TM  v1.1 shall include :    No need to say the name of the lost item aloud any more and let the others know of your folly!A MORE powerful built-in sensor, which means that a mere whisper should be enough to get it cracking and come up with gold. Particularly useful when your mom demands to know what became of the extremely-wearable magenta-and-yellow kurta your aunt's second cousin gifted you. Or when your best friend wants to know the whereabouts of the Coldplay CD you borrowed last month.    No irritating whirring noises any more, even if you search for that hot mini-skirt you stopped fitting into three years ago.    You can now personalise your messages, to make them really sound like music to your ears. Voiceovers of your fave celebrities available!  So the next time you use FSYWCEM TM , you can hear Andy Roddick or George Clooney or Charlize Theron or Anna Kournikova(or is she passe now?) whispering sweet nothings in your ears.  "Honey, that sexxxyyyyy red sleeveless top you have been worrying yourself over is just two inches from where you are standing.Mmmmm, How I envy it!   Okay, this stupid processor here says I better stick to my lines.Damn it!So go ahead you beautiful thing, and pick it up from the third drawer on the left, its the second one from the top in the last row of clothes on the right.Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, say, how about a date tonight?"     To cater to your self-edifying moods, FSYWCEM TM  v1.1 can also act as a deterrent to further misplacement of things crucial to your existence. Purchase Mrs. Weasley's stinker at a bargain price of just $1.25!  (For the unfortunate ones who don't have a clue who Mrs.Weasley is and who are hence unable to appreciate the previous sentence fully,  urlLink here  is where you can enlighten yourselves.)  Sneak peek of the text available below:  "That damned red piece of _RAG_ you have been turning the _WHOLE_ house upside down for is lying at the bottom of your _DISGRACEFULLY_ dirty wardrobe, where you threw it when you came home _SLOBBERING_ drunk at 3 in the morning last Friday! And while you are at it, I want you to get rid of those smelly socks in the bottom drawer, the porn mags that you thought you had so cleverly hidden behind your soiled pair of trousers, and that reminds me, the next time I see you wearing those, ....."   As you read, our technical staff are working on more threatening and haranguing variations. A beta version may be released by early September 2004.    Desi voiceovers to be added soooon. Big B, Saif, Aamir, Shahid, Bips, Sush, Katrina will now croon for your very own hearing and 'finding' pleasure!    It can also make an ideal gift for 'someone you dont love' (your boss?your mother-in-law?your ex?your ex's current flame?that bitch at work?) with negotiations going on with George "Both-Feet-In-The-Mouth-And-Still-Not-Gagging" Bush, Laloo, Rabri, Mayawati, Atal "Yeh-Achhi-Baat-Nahin-Hai" Vajpayee, Deve "Don't-Wake-Me-Up-So-What-If-Im-On-TV" Gowda, Prabhu "I-Will-Make-You-Wish-You-Hadnt-Agreed-To-Be-A-Guest-On-My-Show" Chawla , Sushma "Rolling-pin-wielding" Swaraj and many more!

      with no reference whatsoever to the amazing line-up of sports events on the evening aforementioned. This is all about, who else, moi!  still interested enough to read on? ah, my faithful reader, 1000000000 brownie points to you!  so what did i do which makes the just-breezed-by Sunday qualify as Super?  ~ met up with my school gang after a looooong month. ~ played Hum Tum's soundtrack over and over and over again on the stereo till the music was pouring out of my protesting (they prefer to call themselves 'discerning') friends' ears! ~ purchased two M(which i know i wont read, dunno why, M used to be real hot with me till about a couple of months ago, and its not that i have mentally outgrown them or somethin, heck, whoever heard of tiring of M?!apart from moi that is..anyways..) and 'Making the Minister Smile' by Anurag Mathur. ~ got myself a half-dozen earrings which are too flashy to be worn to work and which i know i will hate in a couple of days. ~ bought the VCD for 'Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar', hence ensuring three hours of pure and unadulterated FUN the next Saturday afternoon. ~ saw Nagesh Kukunoor's 'anti-slick'  urlLink Hyderabad Blues 2  and nay, i wont desist from voicing my opinion of the movie!passable fare, with its moments.Love kukunoor's sense of humor in situations that everyone can identify with,like interfering parents,in-laws,dilemma about when is the right time to have a kid etc, but i would say he adds more value while being behind the camera than in front of it.Jyoti Dogra, who plays Kukunoor's wife, looks patchy and too old to play the character in some of the scenes.Too much of 'anti-slick' ain't a good thing probably.The movie boasts of some catchy  urlLink tracks  though. one thing though, do guys always talk about their married/otherwise lives in such sexplicit detail??!! Proposed tagline : "Dont bring your libido to work." (Kukunoor mouths it in the beginning, only to be reminded of it himself later when he (almost) falls for his hot secretary. (okay, after that bit of digression, i will continue my honorable intention of recounting the other tidbits that made up my Sunday.) ~ went to Gurgaon, and DID NOT pig out on the varied delicacies offered at the food court, M mall, Gurgaon. YAY! I actually resisted the irresistible, and with the sumptious italian food spread at our table too! i only had some bhelpuri (well, Energy Bhel to be precise!) and apple juice at Amoretto's.Felt so good not to have guilt pangs about my unhealthy eating habits afterwards. ~  picked up a formal cream skirt at the Big Bazaar at Sahara Mall, something i had been hankering after since quite a while, but had never managed to get the all the essentials, read color, length, size (used as a euphemism for width here), right at one place. yippppeeeeee!  ~ laughed more in a single day than i did in the past couple of months.  hence ended my Super Sunday.   How was your weekend, my dear readers? *too pretentious, scratch that!* How was your weekend, my can-be-counted-on-fingertips-of-one-hand and of- course-how-can-i-forget-the-dear readers? *scratch that too, it does nothing for my ego* *clears her throat, tryin to think up of something witty, ah!, thinks that she has finally got it* so how was your weekend, my dear can-be-counted-on-fingertips readers who are so gracious as to leave comments, and my equally dear dozens-and-dozens-and-dozens-of readers who prefer to remain anonymous, but cant do without dropping by faithfully to get your periodic fix? ;) *does wonders for my ego and nothing anyone can sue me on either!* *smirk!*  (is that my idea of wit, YES IT IS!) :P   Play it again, Sam! :  urlLink Counting Crows - Big Yellow Taxi   Say it again, Sam? : "I love you even when you're sick and look disgusting." -  Love Actually 
     
      gobbledygook/wizard-speak/lingua de franca of the African tribe discovered late last night??!! nah, just a slightly-more-abused version of an already much abused language. (gosh, that sounds soooo snobbish even comin from me!)  So how do you succesfully communicate with a person who comes up with gems like : "There are different ways to do this are there" (huh??) "In this particular section is there, multiple client requests are there" (hello?)  By the way, here 'section' is supposed to mean 'session', but it is still  pronounced as 'section'. Confused as to how to know if 'section' is indeed 'section' or if its intended to mean 'session' or some hitherto undiscovered intended usage of the word?? Join the gang! All the three days of a training, which me and my more-than-a-dozen colleagues attended, were spent in struggle to make sense of this gibberish spouted consistently by as our instructor! and what really really shocked me was that the guy is a project manager in some organisation! HOW??!! How do those guys dare let him loose on their unsuspecting clients?!  Game for some other beauties? Read on : "I was not able to make the two machines communicate is there." (okayyyy..) "There is one particular class MQQueueManager is particular class is there." (er, what?) "In this particular section, I need a break is there" (uh, sure) "This can be a particular scenario is there" (by this time, i had got to know the lay of the land enough to nod my head sagely at this 'particular' pronouncement)  and my favourite : "I need a particular coffee after this particular section." (completely incapable of coming up with a smartass remark to counter something as profound as this)  we (me and my more than a dozen colleagues) would have put up with this and some more, had the instructor been in command of his subject, which he was not.So the lack of communication skills was all the more damning. And since I had nothing better to do, I thought I would share my misery with all of you and wrote this in the middle of one of the training sessions on the last day. Besides, this helped to prevent myself from dozing off/screaming out loud in frustration.  NB : The above has been written with no intention of poking fun at any individual's command, or rather the lack of it, of the English language. Any seemingly patronizing/condescending/supercilious comments are due to the pent-up negative emotions resulting from the time and effort spent in trying to achieve two-way communication with a fellow homo-sapien and failing miserably.

        Need an away-with-a-by-your-leave. The darned 'flu has claimed me as its own. Since Friday night (lousy timing, I know).  So won't be visiting blogsville until the flu decides to have mercy on me and leave me alone. Though I know you guys won't miss me too much (in gurlspeak, this is supposed to mean that you SHOULD MISS ME LIKE HELL, as I will!).  Keep watching this space for more rants, er, posts.
