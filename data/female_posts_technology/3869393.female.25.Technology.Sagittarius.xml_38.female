This is quite an ironic situation with me, because technically I really have my hands full with work or some other activity, but my heart simply is not able to give a 100% to it yet.  No yoga classes for the weekend, so had to practise it at home.  This is one good thing which is happening in my life, brings a certain calmness to my life esp early in the morning.  After a really long time, think a good number of years, I woke up at 9:30am...but then courtesy of waking up so late, I have this headache which is totally irritating...hmm, this is the reason why its' said early to bed and rise  shine!   Dont know whether its early to bed or late to bed which really makes a difference, just feel that if I take more than the quota of 6-7 hours of sleep, I feel miserablly off!  My life appears to have become quite ironical.  There used to be a time when people used to pull my leg for going to sleep at 10pm, haha, and oflate my earliest nap time is infact 11:30/12....so much for being branded as an early bird.  So far the saturday has been a touch boring, just watched a hindi movie, Chalte Chalte, will have the movie review up in my movie blog soon.  Need to set up links to my other blogs from this one too, hmm, maybe a change in the look and feel...hmm.... wouldn't it be nice if one could change life's look and feel?
