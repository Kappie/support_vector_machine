Showing Off?" essay is obnoxious in most parts and the only humor I found is where she talked of herself showing off with her poems being published and she wanted everyone to know it. The technique I find Viorst using is a lot to do with repetition. There are many examples throughout the essay that explains this. For example, showing off is mentioned throughout the whole essay. Viorst talks also about the different categories of showoffs, which are the competive showoffs as well as the Narcissitic and sympathetic type showoffs. She uses the word exhulting numerous times such as, "Exhulting is what my husband does when he cooks me one of his cheese-and-scallion omelets and pratically does a tap dance as he carries it from the kitchen stove to the table, setting it before me with the purely objective assessment that this may be the greatest omelet ever created." I feel the repition is distracting.
