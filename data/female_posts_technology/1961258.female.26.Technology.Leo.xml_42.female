It's stagnant some days, dips below some days. But I feel better in my clothing, feel better overall and like how I look. I could be fooling myself, for all I know .. but there's nothing wrong with keeping to the light workout schedule I have (swim 3x a week, 1 hour program) and nothing else. I think I need to step it up eventually but it's only been a week or two.  The Xenical is working .. not in the weight loss manner but .. the 'side-effects'. They're not too bad since I don't eat that much fat - at least I know that I haven't been that bad, and the food I eat although in somewhat large quantities is not high in fat. So I know what I need to work on. It's a great panic button thingy .. exactly what I need when/if I gorge myself - instead of laxatives, which I admit I took when I ate a humongous meal like 2 - 3 slices of pizza.  I'm not sure if what I eat is a lot. If what I think of as a huge serving is actually a normal serving? And then I label the day as BAD and go off and make things worse by saying the day's spoilt so what the heck.  Not much junk food at all lately. Am happy about that.
