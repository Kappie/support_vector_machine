Like the elections, or politics, or relationships, or likes and dislikes, or obsessions and compulsions.  But these private messages....These are waaaaaay weird. Just goes to show that there are a lot of lonely people out there, just reaching out, wanting to be acknowledged.  jigjiggler: hi hows it goin? wanna say i like ur profile and u r very pretty,  zhinesade: thanks jigjiggler: welcome sorry if i was bothering u just showin respect zhinesade: np   ******************************************************** deldar_us: hi zhinesade: yes? deldar_us: hi zhinesade: ? deldar_us: deldar deldar_us: u? zhinesade: what? deldar_us: asl? deldar_us: plz deldar_us: ok  ******************************************************** tony_c872:  zhinesade: ? tony_c872: You're attractive... zhinesade: um....thanks... tony_c872: lol...sure.
