When I went on my honeymoon, there was no question. Back to England. I am proud to have been raised to drink tea with milk and raise my pinky. I speak and translate British-English.  I can do no fewer than six different British dialects. But since I came to work for this company, which appealed to me because of its British sub-persona, my tastes are becoming more continental.  A stoic, bespeckled 27 year old by the name of Harriet, and Robin, her dead-on lookalike for Veruca Salt's father in "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" boss are the cause.  Harriet has never heard of a comma. Robin is the only human being I know who can write copy that reads like it was computer generated.  And they don't seem to know how to say "Hello" in under 25 pages. These people are *righteous* about their incomplete, run-on sentences, too It is *their* language, they should be the authorities on how to use it.  Sometimes their sentences are so convoluted even they have lost track of what they were supposed to be talking about.  It is my job to edit them into something that resembles readability. Not that it matters. I ship boxloads of punctuation over to the UK, and they never seem to open the package.  Final printed material comes back to us that is exactly the same as it was before I spent hours untangling it.  Our company's material is off the Fleish-Kincaid Readability Scale, and there's nothing I can do about it.  Everyone here knows that no one will read this stuff. It's unreadable. The collateral material that is going into my portfolio looks like the Rosetta Stone, only somewhat less understandable.  I am essentially editing and re-writing, literally, for my health. Hail Britannia.  To make it worse, I realized the other day that I couldn't even enjoy the latest Rowan Atkinson movie. And I have always adored Rowan Atkinson, unless he got naked and showed his skinny hairy behind on worldwide TV.  Now whenever I talk to Robin or Harriet, images of Rowan Atkinson's hairy skinny behind pops into my mind. I tried to replace it with Hugh Grant, but he's too skinny, too.  The point is, I shouldn't be thinking about famous British backsides every time I talk to my colleagues. But they talk like they write, and so my mind wanders.  I have comma-less Harriet and Veruca Salt's dad to thank for that.  It's not "whilst," Harriet. You're writing high tech collateral material, not iambic pentameter verse. Not that you bloody know what Iambic Pentameter Verse is. Maybe I'll switch to coffee for awhile.  So now my father is not speaking to my husband, because my husband Mark defended my position about their open-checkbook policy towards my psychopathic sister. Or, at least we think he's not talking to him. It's hard to tell with my dad. He could just be being really quiet.    Luckily my friend and highly patient German teacher Thomas imparted a bit of wisdom, albiet from an unexpected source. "Your story is nothing new," he told me, in his softly accented, quiet, unassuming way. "It's in the Bible. A few times."  Thomas is a religious man, but not fanatically so. He wasn't trying to give me a lesson in religion or suggesting that I turn to God for answers. He was just stating a fact, when we met for quesadillas and something, anything, with alcohol in it.  "The Good Child is often overlooked and scorned in favor of the Evil Child."  I thought about this. I know my Biblical commentary. I've read everything Jonathan Kirsch ever put on paper, and most of the stuff in the bibliographies. I thought about Jacob and Esau, and then how Jacob pulled the same stunt on his own kids.  Thomas was right. Thomas usually is. Unfortunately, the Bible is a bit short on information about how to cope with it, but I think maybe the point is there: This is nothing new. I am not alone. There's nothing much we can do about our parents. It's hard to watch, but I can't do anything about it. Not unlike watching a train wreck. And my sister is the biggest train wreck of them all.  But it's nice to know: the overlooked Good Child usually is okay, except for a couple of biblical daughters who got needlessly sacrificed. And it's happened before and it will happen again.  I'm not alone historically, and I am not alone literally, either. Thanks, Thomas. A few words go a long way. Harriet and Robin could take a lesson from you.  I can look at the bright side. At least my parents aren't British.
