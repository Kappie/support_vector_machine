He's not the little voice on my shoulder, he's not my gentle companion watching summer sunsets, he's not in my e-mail Inbox, he's not moving in the same circles. Yet there he is. He isn't worth this constant melancholy. My time ran out and he coldly moved on, without care of my feelings, and having none of his own.  I thought we had worked it out about three weeks ago, but Nancy is really putting the squeeze on him. There was a dinner last Saturday we were all supposed to attend, but Nancy decided she didn't want to go, and Thomas was noticibly uncomfortable there alone.  But he goes to things alone all the time.  The reason Nancy didn't go is because I was going to be there. And Nancy has taken off the mask and now openly despises me. She is going to make it really difficult for Thomas to do anything that might involve me. And it is working. Since she finds fault in everything I do or say, there is no hope that that can ever change. And she must complain--because now all of a sudden Thomas is finding fault in everything I do or say, and now it's to the point where we can barely even talk to each other anymore. Now Thomas thinks of me the same way that Nancy does. I have no fight with this woman, I did nothing to her, but she destroyed the friendship by making me not worth the trouble to Thomas.  Does he truly feel nothing? Does he really feel no loss of me?  I feel his loss everywhere. I don't know how I am going to get through the school year, with him at my side as my partner in running the German School. My guess is that he will bolt very early. Maybe this will be merciful.  Even my passion for German is tainted, cooled, and I cannot let that happen. I was interested in German long before I met Thomas. But I am starting to care about it less and less.  In fact, part of my melancholy is in NOT having anything beyond family and job to care about. No goals, no ambition to reach, just day to day living.  I would almost rather fight with Thomas than have him be absent from my life.  But I don't get that choice.  Traveled to Germany last month, am going to Chicago in a week or so for Supercomm. Maybe he is not in Chicago. "Why did I have to meet you, love you, why can't I rid you from my mind?"... Was the two years of real bliss worth these last six months of agony?  At least I have the memories, the e-mails. But I guess the answer is no, it wasn't. And that's really sad.  If you're out there, Thomas, and you read this somehow, (I don't know how you can, unless this somehow turns up in a Google search attached to your name, or my name, somewhere, and right now, you don't turn up there) you have to know that you walked away in disgust from someone who really loved you. Perhaps that was the biggest mistake I ever made in my life, trusting you, loving you. Believing you when you said how important I was to you. I heard your tales of all these lost female friends of yours, all of whom seemed to suddenly become demanding of you after a couple of years and then finally, irrationally, decided to drop your friendship. I knew even then that it was a pattern, that the one common denominator in all these women who suddenly became irrational and demanding was YOU, but I was so arrogant, I thought that I would be different. I was just stupid and naieve, what did I know of men like you, who do such things to people, maybe even not aware of doing it? But I so believed in you, in an improbable but friendship that brought me happiness, I was blinded to the obvious.
