Newman's Day happens every April 24th, and to participate you need to drink 24 beers in 24 hours.  People are encouraged to drink one beer an hour all day.  When I say "encouraged", I mean by peers, not by the administration.  I never really participated since I knew I couldn't handle it, and I actually think it's kind of gross to drink beer at 8 o'clock in the morning.  Despite my lame showing, I always loved Newman's Day because it brought the whole school outside all day.  Lots of people skipped classes and carried couches into the courtyards to sit and drink.  There were plenty of people playing volleyball or having a catch or throwing frisbees and footballs.  It was such a laid back, social atmosphere.  Everyone dressed really badly as if they were up drinking all night.  Lots of flip-flops and your occasional girl in a bikini top.  One year one of the couches caught fire and nobody would claim the burnt couch so it just sat in the courtyard for days.  My most memorable Newman's Day experience was in the Joline courtyard where I lived sophomore year.  I was hanging out enjoying the scene and chatting with my good friend Kate.  She was attempting to do Newman's Day and was well into her 24 beers.  Someone came over and asked her to join a volleyball game, so she asked if I'd hold her beer.  I'm standing around holding her can of beer when one of the rent-a-cops on a bike rides right at me.  I was like "uh-oh" and "shit" so I put the can down on the ground.  But he came up to me anyway.  Everyone in the entire courtyard turned to watch as I stood there mortified and frozen.  He asked to see my PUID, and I reluctantly gave it to him, knowing that it has my birthdate on it.  He asks if I realize that underage drinking is illegal.  I say yes sir.  He asks what I'm doing with the beer.  I can see Kate pretending to look apologetic while cracking up a few feet away.  I tell him it's not what it looks like.  I'm holding it for a friend.  He almost laughs at my lame story and walks me to the bathroom where he watches me pour it out in a sink and recycle it.  He writes my name down.   Kate owes me big time.  Nothing ever came of it.  I wonder if my name is still written down on some list somewhere.   The bad list .  Everyone should be on a bad list every once in a while.  I definitely had some beer after that.  Yay for Newman's Day.
