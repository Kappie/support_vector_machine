Sybase is also bonded to EDB in a way so they won't just take advantage of cheap labour. Of cos there's circumstances when the company retrench, re-structure, move out of Singapore, etc etc. In the last staff meeting, the folks up there mentioned that they are freezing headcount worldwide except China n India. They state an example that they do not have intention to keep the interns in US when they can get 2 snr engineers in China/India with that price. Hence I am not holding high hopes that they'll keep us all. (There's 9 of us). After serving this 12mths training, I'll have to serve 2 yrs bond (for EDB) in whatever job that I might land myself in.   It now sound like a sucky deal. Just for the sake of the name ("SYBASE") I sold my life for 3 yrs. Whether or not Sybase wants me, is both good and bad. Afterall, in whatever situation that you are in, it can be viewed as good or bad. It all depends on ur perspective.
