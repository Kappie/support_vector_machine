I dont know why he is so distant from me these last 2 days.  I have tried to show him I love him.  I have wanted to make love to him badly. (Unfortunately he is sleeping durning alot of those times).  I just want to go in wake him up and devour him.  He thinks I do not want him.  I do not know what to do. I do not want to loose my husband, I truelly love him.  I have to figure out a way that he knows all the time that I love him.  Next weekend is our annivserary.  They say the first year is the hardest.  I sure the hell hope so.
