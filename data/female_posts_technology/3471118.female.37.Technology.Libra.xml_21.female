       
      This is my worst nightmare...  I don't want to go to the dentist, so I put it off and put it off until something is wrong and I'm forced to go.  I damn near need a valium just to get in the door.  My stomach is fluttering, my palms are sweating, and I'd do just about anything to get out of there.  I would leave, but I need to know what's wrong so I stay.  The whole place seems dark and ominous.  No one seems to enjoy their jobs very much -- no one is smiling or friendly, they all seem to want to get out of there as much as I do.  I'm taken back to the room but they won't let Bobby come with me.  (I'd actually walk out of a place that did that, but for the sake of the nightmare, Bobby can't come in with me.)  So I have to sit back there alone waiting for Dr. Sadist to show up.  When he does, he's very somber and morose, unfriendly, unsmiling, just as miserable as everyone else in the place.  He looks at me like I'm a nutcase for being afraid to be there.  He's very matter-of-fact about the whole thing -- you need to get your teeth checked, no one likes it, you just do it, so suck it up.  He doesn't understand my fears at all.  He's very swift and doesn't take the time to let me know what he's doing.  He gets annoyed by me hesitating to open my mouth for him.  When I finally do, he starts right in with no preamble or explanation.  He's got that pointy thing they use and he's poking around all over my teeth and gums.  He doesn't talk to me while he's doing this at all.  He doesn't seem to have any empathy about what he's doing, either, he's just poking at me without a care in the world.  He's cutting into my gums, making me bleed, letting me rinse only when he needs to see better.  He doesn't think my TMJ should hinder me from keeping my mouth open for two hours straight while he pokes and prods around in my mouth.  When he's done looking around he says I need a lot of work done.  I have cavities that need to be drilled, I have to have a root canal, need my wisdom teeth pulled, and he's going to do it all right then.  He pulls out a needle the size of my arm and sticks it into my gums without even telling me he's going to do it.  I was going to ask him to use the spray-on novacaine first to numb the shot a little, but I didn't get a chance to ask before he just did it.  It's excruciating but he doesn't seem to notice.  It's supposed to be numbing my mouth but I can still feel stuff.  I try to tell him that but he doesn't listen.  He says it takes a minute to kick in and it'll be fine in a while.  So he starts with the drill.  That is the most miserable feeling in the world.  My whole mouth is vibrating from it, it starts hitting a nerve in my tooth and the pain is horrible.  I start to squirm around because of it and his hand slips and the drill hits my mouth.  Now I'm bleeding and have a hole where there isn't supposed to be one.  He tells me to sit still and keeps going.  He's working very fast, like he's rushed and just wants to finish the job, annoyed by how much there is to do.  The drilling hurts, but the filling is finally done.  Without giving me a minute to catch my breath and relax a bit, he starts in on the root canal.  I've never had one before so I don't know exactly what's involved, but I know it hurts like a bitch.  Then he grabs these big clamp-like things and latches them on to my wisdom tooth and just starts pulling.  It makes me sick to my stomach, the pain is so bad, the feeling of him wiggling my tooth around until it starts to loosen, and then he's in there with that pokey thing again trying to pry the tooth out.  I feel like I want to pass out.  This happens three more times with the rest of the wisdom teeth.  When he's finally finished, he wants to give me a cleaning.  As if I'm not sore enough, he starts in with the scrapy thing, and then the buffer thing, and they're hitting all the work he's just done and rubbing against the sore spots, but he doesn't care, he just keeps going.  He finishes with the cleaning and tells me I can go.  He's got this twisted little smirk on his face while he's writing up the paperwork, which comes to a couple thousand dollars.  I feel miserable and it's a week before I can eat solid foods again.  My jaw aches, I have bruises around my mouth, and I think I'll be waiting another ten years or so before I go through this nightmare again.
