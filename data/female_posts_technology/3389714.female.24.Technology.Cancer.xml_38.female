It was utterly pukingly gross.. then he proceeded to open up his $150 suit jacket and pull out a nicely starched handkerchief.. and arrogantly wiped his snotty hands in a rhythmic fashion… I glared at the sidewalk with my mouth dropped open ..there was off-white colored human mucus splatter all over the curb.. I wanted to hurl in ma car.. I was so embarrassed …knowing for sure the cars next to me saw the desi-dude blow his honker in the most vulgar fashion…this obscene gesture makes all other brown skinned 3rd world people like me look extremely horrific… right now I’m ashamed at the uneducated ways of a H1-visa holders ability to suction out snot form their nose…the US government should not give him a green card with out proper demonstration with power point slides on proper techniques of removing mucus from ones nose in a tasteful fashion….that man was a snot head… shame on you…     Question of the Day…   What was the grossest behavior you’ve ever seen?
