I am sure that she will contribute greatly to the role as Rose Tyler.  She was born in 1982 and soon started in theatre before signing a record deal in 1998.  It looks like she has some experience in acting and hopefully will fill the role with her own characteristics and personality.  Everyone around the world is waiting patiently for the new season and I am one of them.  I also realize that I might not get to see them immediately since I am not from England.  I might have to wait a little while longer before I get to see them.
