I guess the interest also got carried over to movies. That's why last week, I was really looking forward to watching "I, Robot" starring Will Smith.    "I, Robot" presents a vision of the future where robots are a part of everyday life. They become the new servants so that human beings have more time to pursue their more meaningful interests. The robots operate under 3 unbreakable laws making it impossible for them to harm their human masters. Only 1 person has an innate distrust of them and that is Will Smith's character, a policeman with a strong prejudice against robots.  One day, Will Smith is called in to investigate what looks like a suicide by the inventor of advanced robotics. The scientist leaves him a simple program which contains a clue as to what caused him to commit suicide. In the process of his investigation, he discovers the existence of one robot who has the uncanny ability to think for himself and have his own identity. Will Smith's character believes that this robot murdered the scientist. No one agrees with him though and everyone thinks he's crazy. He begins to question the 3 Laws and wonders if it is possible to break them. Many things happen to him that seem to prove his theory. All of which lead to the inevitable confrontation between man and machine.  The movie is very interesting because it tries to raise questions about what it means to have consciousness, how important it is to dream and ultimately, what does it mean to be human? The action is paced pretty well so you never feel bored. Plus, the director doesn't rely too much on special effects and noise because he has a good story to back him up. Will Smith himself proves once again that he really has the charisma to carry a film. He never looks like he's trying too hard. Overall, I had a lot of fun watching this film and would definitely recommend this to my friends to see for themselves.
