Much better than dreary brown.  Last night at GEMs was fun.  I started off with the girls in two lines, facing each other.  One side were mirrors and they had to mimic everything the other side was doing.  Then we switched it around.  The lesson was about being created in God's image and how we reflect God like mirrors.  After our little game, I passed around the magazines with our lesson in it.  The girls were not sitting in their chairs, so I said that whoever is sitting by the time I count to 10 gets a candy.  That worked very well :)  I'll have to remember that one.  Our lesson continued the story about Josie that we've been reading all year.  After some questions we got to the fun part.  I bought some foam and mirrors and foam cutouts.  I made frames for the mirrors out of black foam and had the girls decorate the frames with foam shapes.  Heart, circles, squares, triangles, butterflies, dragonflies, ...  The girls loved doing that, and it kept them quiet.  We finished up our evening singing with the rest of the GEMs girls.
