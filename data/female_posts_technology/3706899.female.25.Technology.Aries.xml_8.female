Though I might pick it up during the UMass-UNH game, as I'm not as excited about that...whoever wins, it'll be a good opponent for Maine tomorrow.  Got my yarn for Kool-Aid dyeing in the mail today. I'll have to wind the hanks later if I need something mindless to do.  What should I start for a project after I'm done with the bag?
