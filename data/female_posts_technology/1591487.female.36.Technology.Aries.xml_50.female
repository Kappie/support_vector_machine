I guess the circumstances warranted, coming home late after work one night and finding a strange lump under the covers of one's bed and momentarily waiting for it to perhaps move. What the hell is that?   It turned out to be the hot water bottle my mother lovingly placed in my bed for me. So an act of love, temporarily turned into an act of terror for only for a very short time.  I don't know, I seem to regularly be confronted with small terrors on returning home from work late on Saturday nights, usually of the creature variety, ie. spiders, moths, mice.   The late night is a lonely time and having to fight off things with brooms and cans of insect spray (sometimes hairspray, perfume whatever is at hand) can be a little bit daunting, especially when you're trying to not wake the rest of the household.  Woe is me, eh?  Clearly, I don't have anything of merit to complain about.  Apart from the fact that I think I've been scorned.  The dictionary definition of scorn is; Contempt or disdain felt toward a person or object considered despicable or unworthy.  The expression of such an attitude in behavior or speech; derision.  One spoken of or treated with contempt  I don't know if what's happened to me can constitute contempt and disdain, which I feels requires some sort of passion on the part of the scorner (me, being the scornee), and there's really been none of that, much more of a shrugging 'don't really care' attitude.  Anyhoo, I've always loved that saying 'hell hath no fury like a woman scorned', and basically that's true. Although being  passive aggressive, my 'hell' has pretty much been internal and lots of fantasising about potential vengeful acts and witty sayings. But of course, none of this has eventuated in real life, and I've spent quite a bit of time moping instead.  I guess it's winter,  and it's okay to mope in winter, I have all the accessories of moping, the aforementioned hot water bottle, pyjamas, big fluffy bed socks, a really droopy cardigan.  It's actually quite easy to mope with such attire.  I figured I could take up smoking, I think that smoking is a good moping activity.  While ultimately not good for one's health (I don't know the health merits of moping, I think as it doesn't require much physical exertion, it could be classed a sort of meditation), people who smoke always seem to have that pensive quality when dragging on a ciggie - although in reality it's probably the high from the nicotine rush.  It is difficult to mope at work though. Which is a bit frustrating, as dealing with people tends to negate any moping activity. For which I'm feeling slightly resentful and grateful at the same time.  At which, on cue, here comes someone now who needs some help and clearly, my allocated moping time for today is done.
