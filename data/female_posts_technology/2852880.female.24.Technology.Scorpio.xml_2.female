I should definitely workout more often.  Right now, I'm wearing this babydoll tee that is white with light-blue shoulders and it says Princess 33 across the front.  There are even some sparkles and rhinestones!  It's fabulous.  I wonder how many shirts I have that I've never worn outside of my home.  Must be in the dozens.  I had some great King Salmon tonight.  Probably the best I've ever had.  It was at Cutters downtown.  This nut allergy thing is a real problem, though.  I had to ask 3 times about nuts because I asked about the meal when I ordered it and they said it had no nuts, but it clearly had some nuts on it when it arrived.  The waiter felt bad.  It's a nut-filled world out there...  Just booked my next trip out to see the big B.  Not for 4 weeks though. What's a girl to do??  Rafael's wedding is coming up on May 1st.  I hope I'm invited And Guest.  The whole And Guest thing is interesting.  I mean, I haven't been great about being in touch with Raf, so I'm grateful that he even invited me.  But I'm just not sure I'll know anybody else, so it would be great if B could come.  Either way, I plan on going.  It should be a lot of fun, and I'll probably be skipping P-town reunions this year since it's my 3rd and that's a pretty awkward one.  Time for bed!
