As well as, I feel if I am drowning within mylife. I will try to put on a happy face, and try to go through the motions. If unsuccessful, please don't ask me what is wrong or tell me that its going to be ok. I am not in the mood. If today I could be invisible I would. If you can treat me as if I am not here, I would appreciate it. Thank you!  ..." to sleep, perchance to dream, aw that is the rub, for in that sleep of death what dreams will come"...HAMLET
