The US president, George Bush,  urlLink said  what he thought too. In Memoriam, this day in  urlLink 1998.  On this day last year, a baby girl is born. A mother thinks of naming her  urlLink Nouria.   On the eve of death, life. At the close, dawn draws dusk behind it, a shroud without sentience. The sun unforgiving, the moon impartial. Life taken, life given, in vane.
