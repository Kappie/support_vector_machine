Really, honestly, disgusting. I always thought I looked okay but today I took a good look at myself .. and I'm not okay. I never quite stood in front of the mirror and took a good look, i haven't done that in awhile ... and wow, I am back to being such a big gross fat girl.   I have not been working out, at all. I keep on saying, I'm too tired from a long day at work .. and put it off for another day when 'I've got enough sleep' (or something). How pathetic. I know that once I start working out, even 3x a week .. it'll help. I'm now about 40% - 41% bodyfat which is really truly gross. Although I have always been chunky as hell - even when I was at 145lbs I was 30% or so. So .. hmm .. i don't know what to do with myself. I am so sick of being fat and it's such an easy solution. Eat less (which is working btw) and exercise.    Plus I find out that a Size 12 US is NOT a good thing. It's sometimes a Size 14 UK but usually it's a Size 16 .. which is so not right. When my lingerie arrives, I doubt I'll be able to fit and that'll be depressive as hell.  My bum and upper thighs, back of my thighs .. are like THE most horrible things I have ever ever seen. They're gargantuan. Not to mention my almost bat-wings. I keep on torturing my body like this .. put it on, take it off, put in on but even worse (fat distribution) .. repeat.   I don't know where my energy went. When I lost it the first time, all I did was work out every single day - walk throughout the neighbourhood .. at least 20 - 30 minutes. Then later in the afternoon do my old staple of Cindy C's Shape Your Body (the first one which is not a favorite of most). And I lost it all, which is all this right now in about 2 months.   The next milestone is 165lbs .. I'll try to reach that by mid-May .. solidly hit 165lbs. Then on to the next 4 or 5lbs. I am so discouraged and inspired in a way .. I saw this woman's blog .. and she went from 165lbs to 128lbs in 8 weeks .. 35% bodyfat to 18%! Wowza. That's 5lbs per week .. is that even possible?!
