Note that we don't live together, I'm just there most of the time.   Anyway, about the church.  About a year ago, I started to notice new construction going up on a beautiful gothic-style church on the campus of  urlLink St. Martin's Episcopal  at the corner of Woodway  Sage.  Keep in mind that this is one of the most affluent areas of Houston, and the parishoners certainly look the part.  It's no surprise that they came up with the money for this big gorgeous building.  Since it opened on Easter this year, I have been wanting to go in there.    urlLink     urlLink    Not knowing what time it started and having already slept in until almost 9:00, I missed the early service.  I could also not attend the late service, because Wayne would be coming back and we didn't have time.  Instead, I attended an interesting adult lecture class on Islam - but clearly from the Christian perspective.  It's been a while since I've been to church, and even longer since I've been to one that I liked.   This church was nice, and the people seemed friendly.  On the way out, even though I knew I could not stay, I walked through the main worhip hall of the new church and grabbed a program.  It was absolutely beautiful.  I saw and heard the organ that they had talked about on the web site; it consumed the entire front wall.  There were stained glass windows everywhere.  I made it a point to come back next week and bring Wayne as soon as he was done with training.   One reason I haven't found a church yet is because I have a serious bias about church singing.  I know that some singing is inevitable, and that it's intended to praise God; I understand all of that.  I just don't like to sing.  I especially don't like the Christian-rock style singing that they have in some contemporary services.  Not my style.  The church I went to growing up, when we went, was Catholic.  Given that the Episcopals are supposed to be Catholic-Lite, I think I will be able to identify with their worship service.   After Church I went back to Wayne's, where I waited 15 minutes outside the gate without a remote and not knowing the new code.  Since I had asked Wayne a week ago to find out the new code or get me a clicker, I greeted him in a bad mood when he came home just after me.  Even though I felt I had a right to be annoyed, I immediately regretted being grumpy with him.  I'm still learning when to pick and choose my battles.
