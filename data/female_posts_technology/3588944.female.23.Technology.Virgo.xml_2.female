Back then, homework was actually hand written 99% of the time *gasp*  Yes, it's true!  Anyway, my outlet was that of a personal diary on floppy disk.  I would keep the disk with me everywhere I went so nobody (my mom) would find it, and anytime I needed to vent, I would find the nearest computer with a disk drive.  Back in the day, I was very poetic, and very emotional, so poems took up about 40% of the disk space I used.  Don't worry, I won't subject you to my recent lame attempts at poetry. You see, I have no motivation anymore.  I don't have the over-exaggerated emotions of a teenager any longer.  I have settled and am very happy with my life.  So now what do I write poems about?  Work.  Sleep.  Money.  Butterflies? Nothing poem-worthy.  I used to write about those fleeting crushes I had, and how broken hearted and yet so in love I was.  I look back on these entries now, and find an endless supply of amusement.  I used the word "love" in every other sentence, even though I didn't know what it meant.  I liked a different boy every week.  And sometimes, more than one!  Funny how life can change in a few short years.  I will go on more about this at a later time.  Although this is my first entry, and I have so many years to catch up on, I have so much less time for it now.  Work beckons me back to reality.  And so, adieu...
