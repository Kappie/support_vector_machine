I surely have my work cut out for me. What's gonna happen to Jetless? WHO FUCKING KNOWS! Cause I am so tired of flaky people who like to take their bad attitudes and inappropriate behavior and dismiss it and take no responsibility for their actions. Hmmmmmmmmm......I wonder what that could mean. I don't want that project to be over, but in all reality it is presently going nowhere. We have not practiced in almost a month! Always something. Maybe we will find a drummer and come together as a band. Stranger things have happened. LOL So Dena (sister from Cali)is coming in on July 16 and staying through the 29th! This will be the first time we ever met! Nerve wrecking. Kelly (other sister from Cali)is coming in around X-Mas and Ray (bro from Cali)well I will probably meet him when I go to Cali next summer. This will be another chapter in my life. Ok busy day at work today, must get crackin. Laterz
