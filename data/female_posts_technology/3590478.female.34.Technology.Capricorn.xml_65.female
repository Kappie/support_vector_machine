Real note: Still expecting one unit against this PO which will never arrive thus assuring that this PO will go past due and we will receive an email every week or so from company* asking us why we cannot repair this unit. We are clearly inferior for being unable to repair a non-existent unit and should be punished because the packers and counters at company* miscounted and mispacked. (*I removed the real name of the company. As highly unlikely as it may seem, someone from that company could one day stagger across my blog and then where would I be? There's a company location in Dundee Scotland. And sometimes I dream that someday, after annoying and alienating  all  of my friends here, I might just pack up and go work for them there. And acquire a whole new set of friends and potential dates to annoy and alienate. It’s good to have dreams. It‘s what separates us from marsupials and non opposable thumbed mammals.) Pretend, in my head, note: Still expecting one more GD unit against this GD PO which will never GD arrive thus assuring that this GD PO will go past due and we will receive a GD email every GD week or so from my GD crack head contact at GD company* asking us, in a completely confused, hand wringing GD way, why we cannot repair this GD unit. We are clearly inferior for being unable to GD repair a GD non-existent unit and should be punished because the GD packers and GD counters at GD company* were freebasing and couldn't anymore care less if they shipped us 108 or 109 GD units than if they shipped us GD flammable lard*. Jackasses. I'm tempted to box up my JarJar Binks stuffed animal(who wears a diaper, a tube top and birth control frames and overlooks my desk and helps me think) and send him to them telling them they sent in a wrong part number. (*I guess all lard is flammable. I guess I should grade the lard. I should have said, food grade, combustible engine lard that burns with a white hot light.)
