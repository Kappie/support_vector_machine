It's been a good four and a half years, I've had lots of good times and made lots of good friends.  But I regret not having been involved in more extracurricular activities.  Granted I do have a moderately difficult major, but I certainly haven't spend all or most of my free time studying, I've spent my free time wasting time.
 Usually I'm all about wasting time.  What brings up these regrets is that lately I am seeing all kinds of things I'd like to be involved in, but it seems silly to join up with less than two months left in town.  If I had more time here, I would join the College Democrats and Habitat for Humanity, and be outdoors more, and attend more lectures and concerts.  And I'm seeing more and more that what I thought was a boring little rural town is actually full of fascinating people with fantastic recreation opportunities.  There's a whole side of this town that I never bothered to find, because I was sitting around with my friends trying to figure out something to do that was free.  
 A couple cynical asides: 1) Maybe I only feel so eager to get involved since I know that my imminent departure makes it impractical, i.e., if I  were  going to be around for a couple more years, I'd just find other reasons to sit at home instead.  2) I experienced an ideological shift in the latter part of my education that makes me a lot more likely to want to join the College Democrats, so maybe my only problem is that the shift didn't happen earlier.
