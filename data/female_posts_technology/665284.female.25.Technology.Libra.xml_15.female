Where was my sense of direction?!    Saw Megatrade Hall 1. It was full of furniture so I though "If Mega 1 is herrre, then Mega 2 is waaay over therrr."  Right.  So I went. Like two times.  Like I made the 5th floor building A  B an excercise field when Mega 2 was right beside 1! *slaps forehead*  But Php150.00 is 150.   Sbarro  na yun noh! Spent two hours going round and round the place, checking and admiring the entries, looking at the coveted mangas that cost nearly Php1,000.00 for gosh sakes!  Chatted with some friends who were there, had the first ish of  urlLink  Culture Crash   signed by  Memer  and dedicated to  *urhm*   She might kill me.  Memer's secret priestess *grin* and I even conspired to take away  Tammy Tamaraw   Oh, well better luck next con.  Just the enjoyment on my friend's face convinced me that C3Con was, indeed, successful.  More power Culture Crash!  Oo na. Sayo na si  Jedd .  Pagtityagaan ko na lang si  Dante . Move over  Mina.   You understand don't you   dear?
