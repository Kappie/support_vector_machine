Any of you in the audience who use the Dell website, who use Windows XP, or like the bleeps, bloops and beeps in OS 9 and OS X have these people to thank.  It's interesting to see how MS and Dell went after this company to do their design after Frog did work with OS 9.  Monkey see, monkey do?  ;)  -- Aeryth
