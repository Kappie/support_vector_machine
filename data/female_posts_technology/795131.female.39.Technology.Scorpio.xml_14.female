In a few months we decied we couldn't justify spending almost $50 a month just for tv, so we called the cable company and told them to cut us back to this $10/mo local channels cabled to your home package. So from then on, we just got a bill for about $12/mo...but continued to receive most of the basic channels all along! MTV, Catoon Network, CNN! We were so lucky! But last week several of those channels stopped coming in! And we knew we could not call the cable company to complain about it, because we weren't paying for them. Times are better now, so we called them and said we want to order basic cable again, which now turns out to included Noggin and BBC America! Yay! Well channels 29 - 65 still don't come in, but at least now we could legitimately complain about it! A cable guy came out and said that there is a tree branch interfering with the cable. Xcel Energy is going to come tomorrow to safely remove the tree branch and repair the cable line, apparently. Yes, in this world at the brink of destruction at the hands of Dub-Yah Bush, I am still wanting my MTV! Go figure!
