I have many a soapbox, and do tend to ramble when triggered.  :o)  What you can expect to see her more often than not is an update on my cross stitching, antics of my cats, my reviews of books/cats, or just generalized commentaries on the silly nonsense that goes on in a day.  So, have a fabulous Wednesday and I'll be blogging with you soon.  Melanie
