(her second album was really, really good - she has replaced beyonce as my favorite chanteuse of the moment) i'm just saying that the songs should have something different about them. something. anything. a different beat or a different melody would be nice...      "artists" with songs that sound the same:   5. britney spears   4. phil collins   3. green day   2. 311   1. R.E.M.
