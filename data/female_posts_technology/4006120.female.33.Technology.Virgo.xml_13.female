Yeah, that's what happens when you get a buzz-on. The movie was lame, not worth-seeing in the big screen, wait for it in cable or something, you don't really miss anything. I say not even the good actors like Sigourney Weaver, Adrien Brody  Joaquin Phoenix could make me appreciate it. Lame!  However, the movie made me think of something else though. Every single time I see  urlLink Joaquin Phoenix , I can't help but think of the coincidences or similarities I have with him and his late brother River. First off, his brother River Phoenix and I share the same birthday, Aug. 23, 1970. No big whoa but I don't really know any other celebrities  (dead or alive)  who's born the same day as me, so...  Secondly, I always wondered if Joaquin's scar on the upper lip was congenital, an inborn scar like mine or if it's from a cleft lip repair surgery. Like a good celebrity stalker, I tried to find more information on his possible congenital deformation online, but no dice. I did not have a cleft lip nor a cleft lip surgery but I do have an inborn upper lip scar and a crooked nose - a nasal deformity associated with incomplete unilateral cleft lip maybe or something like that I think.  Oh well, lame movie alright but at least it still made me think in some other weird ways.
