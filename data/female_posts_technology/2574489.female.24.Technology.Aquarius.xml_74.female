After seeing him, we drove out of our way to satisfy our cravings for the best fajitas we've ever tasted.  Brother's Garcia is a family-owned restaurant that we use to frequent when we lived around the area.  We were sad that the old owners were gone as they used to greet us with a familiar smile whenever we would come.  But after asking our server he informed us that the business was still in the family and that the old owner had sold it to his brother, the guy who had seated us.  The rest of our Saturday was spent indoors, vegetatin in front of the television.  Then on Sunday, we woke up rather early to meet with my parents and brothers at church.  After that we went to Benihana Grill and Restaurant.  Our chef, Zu Hap, was great.  He flipped eggs and bowls of rice while he cooked our food right in front of us, although he couldn't actually perfect that rice bowl flip trick.  We then sauntered to the closest mall and laughed our heads off as we browsed at Neiman Marcus.  My mom, who is not averse to buying pricey things, almost had a heart attack at the $1000 Prada bags we came across.  We visited Bebe, and my Mom gave bought a Bebe shirt for my b-day gift.  I bought my parents this cake they've been wanting from Corner Bakery, then went to parent's house and watched ASAP. Some obeservations:   Vilma Santo's son Luis aka Lucky is not that cute   Kristine Hermosa's outfit was  baduy    I didn't recognize as many people as I thought I would   I know that Mahal and the other small person is supposed to be funny, but they actually make me sad   Woody enjoyed the Viva Hotbabes, hehe   The show made me want to have tight abs   :p   -
