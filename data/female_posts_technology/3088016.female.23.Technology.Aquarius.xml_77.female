I won't spoil it for those of you who want to watch it, but I'm satisfied with the way it ended.  That could be a spoiler in itself.   There were one or two seasons when I watched the show every single week, and I liked it.  I know that I could have downloaded this episode for free, but I wanted to have the official one because I have given serious thought to collecting them all, starting with season one.  Over the next year or two, I could watch every episode.  Does that make me strange?  Maybe I should just invest in the "Best Of" DVDs.  It would be easier and cheaper to do this with Will and Grace, which has a lot less seasons to keep up with.    Some people I know say they don't watch TV, and I can understand not being around enough to catch any shows.  Having the DVD is so much better than watching the show, though.  It's commercial-free, pausable/rewindable comedy with a thirty minute resolution to every problem.  Easily watchable entertainment.    Speaking of my one show that I do watch, there are two hours on tonight of  urlLink The Bachelor .  The regular hour is The Women Tell All and the second is a regular episode.  Judging from the spoiler last week they're going to bring back one of the chicks who was kicked off and let her stalk the bachelor.  This disappoints me, because I was so happy with my illusion before that I don't know for sure that the show is staged.  If it goes the way I expect, I'll know it is.
