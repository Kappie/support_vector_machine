I cleaned house, got my oil/oil filter and air filter changed, and did the groceries with hubby, as well as worked out.  Yay for me!  I just need to catch up on my school work and I'll be up to speed on everything.    I also did my year-end financial report and have come up with some embarrassing facts about our spending habits and some goals to remedy it, neither of which I will elaborate on.  There's one other major thing hovering on my mind: how to fit our finances to make do with 3 trips coming up within the year and early next.  The plan was to go to Las Vegas on November, and to Philippines early March 2005.  The third trip was the trip we forgot, to California for my Lola's 75th b-day in July.  Woody and I are planning to tighten the belt considerably to double up on our savings.  I celebrated this plan by buying a pair of heeled sandals from Aldo =).  God please, give me the strength to say 'no'.  No to dinners out, no to movies, no to shopping, no to a brand new computer....NO TO A BRAND NEW COMPUTER!?!  Oh, my, it's gonna be a long year.
