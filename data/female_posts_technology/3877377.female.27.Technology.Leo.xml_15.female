There's some silly subplot about rival gyms, a dodgeball tournament, and Ben Stiller's package, but at the forefront is a charming story of a young man coming to terms with his identity as a pirate. Learn and grow with Steve as he realizes that he has to be true to himself, and that no matter what you look like on the outside, if you feel like a pirate on the inside you have to make this noise every 30 seconds: "Arrrrrrrrr." Hell, Steve, we could have told you that. Like any good pirate story, and I'm not really giving much away here, Steve receives his booty in the end.   I only hope that all the "Steves" out there find some strength and hope in this film. You are not alone!!   **Here's where I'd do an ASCII graphic of a skull  crossbones if I had 17 hours.**  May the wind always be at your back, and your rum bottle always be full.
