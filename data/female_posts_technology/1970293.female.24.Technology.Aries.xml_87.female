The wizard leaned over the dragon and peered intently into the smoke but couldn't see a thing. He grabbed his hat as it started to slip from his head.   "Well I was thinking of dropping you off so you could sneak around and take a look." Trellian yelled back as he banked to the left.  "And where were you going to drop me off at?" The wizard grabbed on tight again as the dragon finished banking. Suddenly the dragon dropped twenty feet in free fall before catching some air with his wings to slow down the fall. Slowly, steadily the dragon fell until he was close to some branches of a large oak tree.  "I was thinking of dropping you off here for a while and I can pick you up later if you like." The dragon hovered in the air beside the tree.  "Thanks for asking me. Next time give me a little more advance notice so I can tell you that I am not a monkey!" Bardric muttered as he grabbed his pack and slung it across his shoulder while holding onto his staff. He flung his leg over and jumped into the tree.   "Well you jump like a monkey so maybe some of your ancestors were monkeys." The dragon said blandly without breaking a smile.  "Just make sure you can pick me up later. I would hate to stay down here with strangers since I hunger for your company." The wizard called back as he agilely climbed down the tree soon to be lost from sight. He proceeded slowly the closer he moved towards the forest floor just in case of trouble. He definitely didn't want that. He noticed that it was very quiet. No birds or squirrels chittering or chattering.   After he was about twenty feet from the ground, he stopped and listened. He couldn't really look around since he was still pretty high up in the tree and covered by the green leaves. Silence seemed to the forest's song today.
