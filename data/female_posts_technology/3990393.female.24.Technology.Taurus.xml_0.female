While on our way home (heavy traffic as usual), momc was complaining of being caught in the middle of 2 vehicles coz she needs to be careful of both sides of the car..then I wondered if the inventor of the car already considered everything (such as the side and rearview mirrors) when he created it.  Then momc said that she was more impressed and amazed at the discovery of electricity and communication eqipment (such as phones, radios and computers)..how the former can bring light and power to things and the latter be so small yet so powerful that people all over the world can get connected in a single click or push of a button. And then I just kept on enumerating other amazing inventions and discoveries such as the rocket spaceships, airplanes, satellites, elements, atoms, medicines..and I just thought, wow! man is great..
