I've been noticing more  more positive signs about the November election. Except for one Bush sign on my block, and a smattering of Bush bumper stickers here  there, for the most part all I see is major support for Kerry - yeah!!  However, there was one news item this week about Kerry that irked me. He was asked: knowing what we know now about Iraq, would he still go to war...he said yes.  Yes?! I doubt that he thought that answer through. I think he was worried about the ignorant red-neck vote when he answered that question. I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt on that one.
