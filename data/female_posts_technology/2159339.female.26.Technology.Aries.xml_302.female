The back used to stick straight out like a chick (God bless Asian hair) but now it does this bend thing where if a boa constrictor coiled itself around my neck it would not disrupt the back of my hair at all.   If a boa constrictor should coil itself around my neck, I would jiggle my goods and sing, "I'm a... Slaave 4 U!"
