I think Tony Soprano is softening up in his old age.  Kind of like Bill Gates did when he had kids.  Either way, the show is still good.  I like the way they show the human side of everyone.  A lot of that stuff actually seems realistic.  At least realistic enough for me.  I saw Mean Girls yesterday, and I thought it was really funny.  Some of it reminded me of the kind of stuff I'd pull in middle school.  In particular, we did a lot of the three-way calls where the third person didn't know that someone else was listening.  We did it mostly to guys.  I remember asking a guy "Do you think Amanda is pretty?" while she was listening to every word.  Luckily, the guy said "I guess so."  We'd also fake "beeps" (call waiting) a lot when we wanted to politely get off the phone.  I had brunch with CJ today at the Jitterbug Cafe in Wallingford.  We talked about life plans, specifically how much separation we'd want between work and life.  I don't want work to be the reason I get up in the morning.  CJ wants his job to be such that it is intermingled with his everyday life.  I think it really depends on what kind of job you have.    To bed, I said!
