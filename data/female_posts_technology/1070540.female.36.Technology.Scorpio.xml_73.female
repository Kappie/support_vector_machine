I try to lay down with him but I dont want to wake him up.  I am kinda getting sexually frustrated right now as well and that does not help.  I cant seem to satisfy myself and need him.    I have started my excercise and I hope to start setting up a routine. I am trying very hard to set up a routine for me so I can be more organized. You cant tell it yet but it is working.   I have a goal to loose 3-5 lbs a week and when I get down a little smaller than the size that I want I will start beefing up my excersise so I can tone up very well.  I am extremely excited about becoming fit.  Today after excercising I felt very energetic and felt so good.  I only had 4 hours sleep but still am not tired.  I love this feeling.    I cant wait to lay next to my husband while he rests and feel his arms around me, his head resting next to mine where I can feel his breath upon me. Feel his naked body against mine so cool, so soft, his legs wrapped around mine. holding me tight. Holding me, keeping me safe, loving me while he sleeps. I love this man so much.    One day he will realize that I love him way more than he realizes. Way more than he ever thought I would!
