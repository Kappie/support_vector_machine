She placed too much of her time into this life and she wasn't about to lose it.  She could remember each of her deaths as if it was only yesterday and each one worse than the one before.  Dying old would be something different and something she yearned to experience one day.  It seems her soul had a mission that wouldn't be complete until everything clicked into place.  Her soul lived a thousand lives.  Each death began a new life in which her work would start over again.    Of course since the elves have found out that her soul has never died, they have been committed to help her in her mission.  At least the elves had long lives.  Since she always came back as a mortal, often she would have three or four different bodies before a new elf came to replace the old.  It was nice to have that steady influence within her chaotic life.  Often she yearned for a normal life in which she could marry, have children, grow old, and die.  Maybe someday she would experience that dream.  She looked at Lleywyn.  Unfortunately he was an complication within her life at this moment.  She could see that he fell in love with her the moment he saw her.  Well truthfully, she had feeling for him too but she squashed them back into a dark deep place because this was no time for her to feel those sorts of feelings.     They entered the small town and seeked accommodations for their stay.  The town definitely had a picturesque quality about it.  She also noticed that no one was about.  It was only three in the afternoon.  Plenty of time before the last meal of the day.    "How does this town feel to you?"  She asked the elf his opinion.     "It's too perfect.  There is secrets here.  I also feel that some are dark and others are not.  Not a very happy town."  Lleywyn replied after a few minutes of silence.   "That is exactly what I feel.  This is not good.  I feel that we are too late or perhaps almost too late.  Lets walk through the town quickly.  We need to find the one."  Katlyn said quietly and vaguely.  She definitely didn't want to give too many details just in case someone over heard their conversation.
