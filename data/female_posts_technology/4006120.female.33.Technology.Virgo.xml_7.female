And more pics of Baby Bro's bday party earlier this month from my friend Janis in LA. Will post 'em later...  I remembered dozing off to sleep with John Kerry's speech last night.  No, it wasn't boring. It was good. I was just tired. ( "I don't want to claim that God is on our side. As Abraham Lincoln told us, I want to pray humbly that we are on God's side."  )  That was a good line.   The painters are here. They are going to re-paint our pink kitchen today. Gotta run...
