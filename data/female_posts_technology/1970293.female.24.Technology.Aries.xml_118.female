She sighed inwardly as she counted out loud for him to follow.  He couldn't even keep his eyes closed for more than a few seconds.  "Tom, look at me.  What are you thinking about?"  She finally demanded.  "I was wondering how much longer we'll be.  I have so much work to get started on for tomorrow."  He said quickly.  "Homework hour is not for another thiry minutes.  Right now you need to be working on breathing in a pattern and clearing your mind.  If you do not learn this you will be considered hopeless as a page, a squire, and a knight.  Do you want to go home in disgrace?"    His eyes widened.  "I didn't realize that.  I thought this was some stupid exercise that my father is making me do.  I never thought I could be sent home if I don't learn to control myself.  Is that really true?"    "Yes it is.  They told that you had to learn to be patient and calm.  It was up to me to settle you before the real training begins.  Now we'll stop for the night but think of your actions.  We'll start over tomorrow night with something different."  She stood up and wiped her pants off and turned toward the castle.    "Alecka, I'll try harder tomorrow night."  With that announcement he was off for the dormitories in a dash.  She shook her head.  She had no idea how to keep his attention on this task.  She definitely was going to have to start with minutes and build the way to longer intervals.  He just had too much energy to be constrained in any manner.  Tomorrow was looking more and more like torture.
