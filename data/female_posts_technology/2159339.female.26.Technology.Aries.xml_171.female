Not that I'm irresponsible - I've always been able to find a replacement job within a week or two. It's just that this is my first 'career' job and I thought I could make it last at least a few years. But it looks like that won't happen.   I found a couple of teaching jobs in japan. Those are still pretty easy to come by. Maybe after my least runs out, I'll run away again. No northern village this time. Tokyo or Nagoya or maybe Kyoto.  Somewhere where the demographics include at least 5 people in my age bracket.   I came to the conclusion that I don't want a career. I want to bounce around for as long as I possibly can. Maybe I have some sort of a job ADD.  Ok. Back to the ol' database. Snooore.
