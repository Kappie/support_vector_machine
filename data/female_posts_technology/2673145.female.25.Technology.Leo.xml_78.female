The journey was alright, slept most of the time.  Sis' friend, Raph picked us up at the bus station and went straight to savour the local delights. When we were done with our breakfast, Raph was already planning where to for the next meal. Well, before coming, Sis told him that our objective was to eat.   After checking into the hotel and freshening up ourselves, Raph brought us to another round of eating. We were so stuffed after that and requested for some 'tourist visits' to the famous temples in Penang.   We decided to skip dinner and meet Raph for clubbing at night. In the meantime, we did a quickie at the nearby shopping center and bought a bottle of orange juice. We were quite disappointed that we couldn't get any bargains. But it is also due to the fact that we were all tired from the journey.  We napped for 4 hours and almost wanted to give up clubbing and carry on with the sleep. Glad we didn't. We went to two clubs and one of them was having ladies nights (on a weekend!?). I thought a little village like Penang won't have too great a nightlife but I think it was better then in Singapore.   Next morning, Raph met us at 1030 and we continued with our eating expedition. After breakfast, we were planning to take a scenic drive up to the mountains and the beach but decided to give up when the traffic was really slow. We shopped at another shopping center and got a better 'returns' this time round. After more slow traffic, we made it back to the hotel with 4 really full bladders. We relaxed and chatted in the room before making our way for dinner again. We had the apportunity to explore other parts of Penang apart from the beach and the town while driving to the seafood restaurant. Pity, the restaurant was full and we settled for a simple chinese restaurant further down the road.  That night, we sang our lungs out until 1am at a karaoke lounge next to our hotel. With coarse throats, we went back to our room and pack for our departure the next day.   Raph insisted on bring us out for a last breakfast before our coach leaves at 1030. It was really sweet of him to help us scout for coach back to S'pore since Monday. Our Penang trip couldn't be this great without him.    I use to think that Penang is a country-side-village. But it looks like Singapore 10yrs ago. They are developing, slowly. There are places that are run down, dilapitated and flirty. But there are also developments to improve on them. Of all the Malaysia states, I prefers Penang.   At the end of the trip, on the 10 hours ride home, we pondered about friendships. My sis asked me to join some social club to get to know more friends. Cos we realise that I don't have many, and can count on maybe just one. But isn't one better then none? Anyhow..I don't want to think about this. I have my own mind and plans. I will do what I please, when I'm ready.
