Kev and I were really bored tonight and we drove around kitchener to find something to do...we ended up finding nothing and did our usual filming around and in the car thing. We stopped by jack astors for our food and then went back home with really bad stomache aches. Ugh... it hurts...  Earlier today I went in to work, thinking that I started at one...boy was i stupid...i didn't work at all today... I could have slept in... but nooo I got my ass up and went to work and got laughed at..yeah I laughed at myself for it. It proves that I love my job too much. I worked two hours for free and then went out for lunch with Kevin and hung out at the mall.  Later on we hung out at his place and talked online to people. I met up with Mike at McDonalds when I Told him to meet at Mac's corner store. lol...Anywho, i let him borrow ogr battle 64 last nght and he gave it back to me today. When he went home after i saw him today he was going to talk to his parents. I hope it went well.  I gotta work again tomorrow. We're all planning on getting together for a game of Outdoor manhunt. I hope I can get a hold of a lot more people. It'll be great playing out in rieverside park while it's dark out. Just like in gradeschool...heh.  I'm out for the night...I need sleep for tomorrow.    Open your eyes and you will see everything.  -The Lonewolf
