A current issue of Time costs 90 to a hundred in stores.  Orient Pearl, where I purchased the magazines, houses computer shops, pirated cd and secondhand book vendors.  It's in recto next to National Bookstore.  Do you subscribe to magazines?  I hope that I'd live in my own apartment on my 26th year.  That's next year.  These days cellphone loads can be had for 30, 60, 115 apart from the usual 300 and 500 from prepaid cards.  Instead of buying cards, your nearest sari-sari store or budy can send your phone text and call credits via text.  My officemate who knows this guy introduced us to this little business.  I ended up buying John the sim card (150) and automatic load (500) for selling.    One of my favorite appliances is the television.  It broke yesterday.  Just a small part.  The main switch.  Sharp service man came over today.  I left money for mom to pay for service and when I called this evening John said that we paid double what we expected because a part really had to be replaced.  Luma na talaga kasi.  Heard of Vienna Teng, Dad?  She's good.  I was at the Music One record bar the other day and her album was featured in one of their listening stations.  I hope to buy her album this coming payday.  If not then after bossaManila.  How's Tito George and Kuya Not?  How are the lovebirds?
