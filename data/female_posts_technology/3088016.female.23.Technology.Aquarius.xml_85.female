Of course, we had to park a couple of miles away in someone's front yard (you think this is an exaggeration, unless you live in Houston or you've ever been to this thing).  While we were looking for a place to park, Wayne spotted a huge turtle sitting on top of a car, with people taking pictures of it.  Something you don't see every day.  Once we had parked and were walking toward the parade, we saw a sign posted on a light post that read "Lost: Large 30 pound Tortoise."  Even stranger.  We had seen the turtle, but now it was gone.  Who has pets like that?   There was a little bit of everything and everyone at the parade.  My favorite car was  urlLink this one , solely because they had a live duck in the front water pond who was eating and enjoying the parade.  I also voted for it because the creators are a bunch of high school students, and winning a $1500 prize would mean something to them.  Several were political entries, most of which were either anti-Bush or anti-American.  Some were of local issues, like the  urlLink Bayport expansion .       My favorites were typcially the animal entries.  The one of the  urlLink rescued German Shepherd  was also cute and almost got my vote.  Unfortunately, we didn't bring a camera to take pictures, our M.O. since most of the training rides for the MS 150.  It was a typical outdoor festival scene.  People were selling worthless stuff and food was bought out of taco trailers.  There was one of those guys who does paintings of the stars and moon entirely with spray paint and a few tools like coffee cans and razor blades.  It's interesting to watch, but I can't see putting up one of the pictures in my home.    To see all of the pictures, go  urlLink here .
