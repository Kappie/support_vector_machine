I will have to go tomorrow after work. Have a busy schedule this week.  Collen and I went to see Spider Man 2. It was awesome! Can't wait till 3 comes out.  Trying to figure out plans for Boston. Sean needs to let me know when he is taking Collen and I will go from there. Yeah, can't wait. Dena comes in a week from Fri. I am nervous about that. Trying to make plans to show her around Chicago.
