Nothing like seeing chrome in HDTV baby!  The up north deal is that I had to ride up w/ the g-folks and ride back home w/ the bro, my mom and the niece and nephew.  Figured the ride back wouldn't be so bad but of course the ride up will kill me.  At well it almost did.  G-folks like to preach and are major control freaks.  They suggested, before I moved into my small apt, I should move in with them.  Um...yeah, hell no!  They thought it would be a great money saving move.  I'm thinking ... NO FUCKING FREEDOM.  They try to reassure me that I can come and go as I please.  Yeah, right.  That's why they call every other day to find out what I've been up to.  Oops...that was a side rant, sorry.  Anyway, they complained about the bro and his icky g-friend.  Oh what they don't know.  So most of the ride was that then it was where I might travel and I shouldn't go alone or I should go to Aussie instead.  How does "parking my butt on a beach and chilling out" convert into I should go to Aussie?  I figure if I go to Aus then I really can't park my butt on the beach.  I have to check out the towns, shopping, museums, and people.  Well we get to the cottage, my stomach is upset, I'm going to puke, and I have to help unload all the crap.  All I want to do is change into jammies and relax.  Nope almost everyone else wants to do something.  After a few minutes no one but the kids want to do something.  For the week we caught about 150 fish.  Mostly Blue Gills, a few small mouth bass and sunfish.  Bro cleaned ‘em up and fried a small amt of ‘em on Friday.  It was very cool!  Kids had a great time too.  They actually wanted to stay up there for another week.  Ride down, my stomach was upset again.  Can’t anyone understand that taking turns and hills faster than 10 mph is bad on this girl?!  What the hell.  I’ve only told them for the last two years about it.  I slept most of the way back cause of the tummy.  The kids were fine watching their DVDs, well until they fell asleep too, from Rhinelander to the meeting of I-94 and Hwy 39.  I was the first to be dropped off.  Cool with me.  I didn’t do anything when I got home anyway, other than eat some junk food to settle my tummy.  Babies were very happy to see me.  I now had cat appendages the rest of the weekend.  It was pretty cool.  Next Room:  Kitchen – What do you have in there and what color is everything?
