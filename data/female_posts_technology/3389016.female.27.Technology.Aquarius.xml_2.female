Once we got to the ship they took pictures of us for out ID cards (god I looked awful!) and got us checked in to our rooms we were then informed that we would have to leave the ship in two hours at 6pm since there was a black out. (I still haven't slept at this point) I check into my room get totally unpacked, moved in, and take a shower. I am on my bed counting my new monopoly money and Mohammad (the front desk guy)  Joe knock on my door and tell me that I have to change rooms and I only have 5 min to do it, since the ship is evacuating. So we run down the hall with my clothes draped over their arms (I am in heals) to my new room and I have to leave immediately to meet everyone out side. I forget to bring my ID and my jacket (lack of sleep). Now I have to figure out how to walk across a gangway riddled with holes in heals, lets just say I was getting laughed at and I hadnï¿½t even been visible for more than 5mins. I find out that we are going go-cart racing at an indoor track down the road. It is so cool when we get there (remember I am in heals). The track is pretty complicated with tunnels and bridges. We sign up for the race and I have to wear a very smelly jump suit and drive in high heels but somehow I manage to race pretty well. I am all hopped up on RedBull and ready to go. My highest score placed was 7th. I had a lot of fun waving at everyone while I was driving. I can't believe that they let us drink and drive (I love this country). We also had a barbeque that we got to cook our own meat on the grill. urlLink
