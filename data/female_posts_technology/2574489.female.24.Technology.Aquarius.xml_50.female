Yesterday, when S rolled it around the office and offered each of us a slice, I declined.  I puffed up my chest with pride. I declined cake!  I am a good person.  But this cake. This Tres Leches Cake.  It is  malo  or bad.  It purrs at me whenever I grab something healthy from the fridge.  My apple.  My bag of mini carrots.  My chicken teriyaki.  It purrs:  "Me taste so bueno.  So bueno.  Eat me, por favor. I only want you to eat me."   It morphs too.  The original icing on it said, "Good luck on your Wedding Day, C!". But the icing has been smashed, cut here and there by those who gave into temptation.  It now has the first initial of my name.  It is  malo !  I shut the fridge quickly, but I know its still behind there.  Lurking.  Waiting to entice me.
