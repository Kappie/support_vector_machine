I tried almost all of them from size 39 - 41 (I have no pride, and I was getting desperate.)    I don't  need  new shoes, I  want  new shoes.    I have hundreds of shoes/boots/slippers, I really don't have room for the ones I've got, but I wanted more.  I  needed  more. I couldn't find any for me at all, so I did the next best thing and bought my daughter some.    My husband thinks its an obssession, but its not, it's my hobby, you know.
