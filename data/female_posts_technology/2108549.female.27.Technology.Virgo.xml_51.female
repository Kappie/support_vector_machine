Next week I'm scheduling it.  The flip side though is that I am grateful to have a life back.  After I started seeing M, I gave up a lot of it to sit and wait for him.  I lost touch with a lot of people and stopped making plans I should have made.  When he and I split up, I was left with nothing but a lot of time on my hands.  Moderation though is obviously a lesson I haven't learned yet!  :)
