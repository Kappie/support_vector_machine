I didn't work out because I was still feeling lazy and sick. Then yesterday I slept in till like, noon, ate a stale bun at some point, then had a gross burger king chicken salad for lunch, some melba toast for a snack, and then lemon pepper salmon for supper. Mmm so good. Just the fish, this tomato saucey stuff, some grilled veggies, and a baked potato with margarine. I didn't work out yesterday either, but I was up hanging out outside until like 4am, so hopefully that burned a few calories.      So far today all I have eaten is some cottage cheese and a fruit to go. I plan on having chicken, a potato and some sort of vegetable for supper, and maybe I'll go for a walk. I'm feeling better, but I'm really tired. Wonder why, lol.      I finally bit the bullet and signed up for a gym today. I now have access to all City of Mississauga community center gyms and pools. I think it's going to be good. I will prefer working out with old people than muscleheads, lol. I am really going to have to step up to the plate if I want to make my goal....there are only 19 days left!
