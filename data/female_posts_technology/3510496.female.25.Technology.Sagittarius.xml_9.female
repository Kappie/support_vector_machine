Hubby always overcome his indigestion by drinking Ginger-O, very, very pure ginger extract. No tea, no yum-yum, no moo-juice. Suppa-Pure.   Do you exactly know how long it takes to digest various foods?   This is taken from some old encyclopedia.   Rice ............... 1 hour  Milk (raw) ......... 1 1/4  Milk (not raw) ..... 2  Apples ............. 1 1/2  Eggs (raw) ......... 1 1/2  Eggs (boiled) ...... 3  Beef (roast) ....... 3  Bread .............. 3 1/4  Carrots (boiled) ... 3 1/4  Butter ............. 3 1/2  Cheese ............. 3 1/2  Fowl (roast) ....... 4  Cabbage ............ 4 1/2   Hmmmmm ... it seems uncooked food takes shorted to digest. So go raw?       Greek Melt      total time: 25 minutes | makes 2 sandwiches  This is my 1st sandwich recipe using Pita bread, and using Feta cheese, Greek's white cheese. You could pick up Feta cheese in major stores like Cold Storage (recommends: Railway Mall  King Albert branches because of its very wide cheese range).  The beauty of this sandwich is that it can be knife-and-fork affair (putting the toppings on top of the flat pita itself) or, a movable feast by putting the fillings in the pita.  1 pint of cherry tomatoes, halved 1 tbsp of olive oil 1 tsp of salt 4 ounces of Feta cheese 2/3 cup of plain yoghurt Juice of 1/2 lemon 2 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced 1/4 tsp of chili flakes (like the ones they have in Pizza Hut) 10 ounce of cleaned Spinach (Popeye's strength food! 2 pitas  Pre-heat oven to 200 degree celcius. Toss the tomatoes with 1 tbsp of olive oil and 1/4 tsp of salt. Arrange the tomatoes cut-side up, on a baking sheet. Bake until they are just softened, which may took about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk together the Feta, yoghurt, lemon juice and 1/4 tsp of salt. Set aside.  Place a medium skillet over medium heat. Add 1/2 tbsp of olive oil over to the skillet. Add the garlic and chili flakes. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is softened and just turning golden. Add the spinach and remaining salt. Cook, tossing occasionally, until the spinach is just wilted, about 4 minutes.  Place the pitas in the oven and heat until lightly toasted, about 2 minutes per side. Then fill/top cooked spinach and baked tomatoes in/on pitas and drizzle with yoghurt-Feta sauce.
