It even looked like it would be hard to do in the store--imagine trying to stuff a pillowcase that's thirty times larger than you are.  But I thought I'd try it.  There were a few unexpected surprises. For one, I really thought that the thing would be sewn up on three sides, open on one, with some sort of zipper or buttons or something for closing up the patient once you got the thing installed.  You can imagine my shock when I discovered there was only a tiny opening at one end with two buttons on it--far too small to fit the duvet in without ripping it to shreds. Mark and I looked at each other, and then Mark wordlessly left the bedroom.  I thought I would turn to the Internet for installation instructions, since the box helpfully came with none.  All I could find were humorous pieces about how difficult it is to install a duvet cover, but nothing in them which shed any light on how to get a 9 x 9 duvet into a 3-foot opening.  I look at all the stores, I look at the pictures of duvets with covers on them, and I think, "somebody knows something...but they're not talking."  I imagine a secret society of insiders who have The Knowledge.  Nobody's sharing. I bet the Fab 5 know, I bet Kai can whip one of those puppies on in two seconds flat. But alas, I am female and have a sense of style, so they would have no interest in my case.  And I think, is there no more human decency?  Speaking of human decency, or lack thereof, my psychopathic quasi-suicidal sister got outed, and not in a good way. She planned the whole "suicide attempt" in order to bilk my parents out of money. Terrible thing to discover about one's own family, but it's better than not finding out.  (See post one for sister's suicide saga.) My parents are having a hard time with the news, but I think they do believe it.  So I didn't save anybody's life the night of the 14th. I've spent the last two weeks trying to convince my parents not to hand over their life savings to a psychopath, and have been met with every sort of reaction from suspicion that my motive in keeping them from being bilked is for my own financial gain, accusations that I am being a prima donna because my youngest sister is the focus of attention, that I was trying to prove my parents were stupid, anything except that I was trying to protect them from falling into the grasp of a diagnosed psychopath so they wouldn't end up completely impovershed in their old age. My only motivation. Protect parents from predator.  The only  reason I even tried to prevent my sister from killing herself in the first place is so that she wouldn't hurt my parents, and because it was the Right Thing to Do.   You know what I think?  This, coupled with a couple of other incidents with some other people, has led me to believe that human decency is so rare that people cannot even recognize it anymore.  Everyone sees conspiracies in everything. I guess you could say it was my own lack of faith in human decency which led me to uncover my sister's plot. Even I couldn't take a suicide attempt at face value! But I have recently been told that gestures of friendship I have made towards someone were met with suspicion and revulsion--"why would she compliment my two-dollar Target earrings? Why does she notice my outfits? What's she trying to get? Why do they always invite us to things?"  This person was incapable of recognizing overtures of friendship, because she automatically assumed there was an ulterior motive.  What is WITH people these days?   Yes, I notice two dollar earrings, if I like them. I don't withhold a compliment if I suspect something wasn't expensive, what a thing to say!  I compliment people when I genuinely like what they're doing or wearing, because I know I enjoy compliments myself, and would like to be able to give that feeling to someone else. If I think someone looks slobby and can't seem to understand color matching or personal hygene, I shut up.   I make overtures of friendship towards people I like because I like them.  I steer clear of people I don't like. And because if I waited for people to be friendly with me I'd end up living alone with six dozen dachshunds.  It is so sad to me that people cannot even recognize who is a friend and who is a foe anymore.      I understand, it's true that there are psychopaths in this world who are friendly and nice and are out to bilk every last dime out of you ("cashews," my friend Dave calls them--nuts who are trying to get cash out of you) and you have to be careful in this world, but I think it may be possible that there are other people out there who also believe that someone just genuinely wants nothing from you but to be your friend, and to have a freind in return.  Isn't there?
