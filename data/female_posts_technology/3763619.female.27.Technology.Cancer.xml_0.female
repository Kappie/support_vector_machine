I was so glad to get away from the high school years that I never thought about the possibility of going back to them one day.  There are endless comparisons between the two:  - stupid rules that no one wants to follow  - cliques are prevalent (It is easy to point out who was the popular kid in school and who got booked in the hallway.  People still gravitate toward the former and make fun of the latter in the workplace). - gossip (aka the rumor mill) -etc.  It's kind of funny how things don't really change at all as time goes on.  Life is cyclical, and you just have to hope that the next time you are faced with a similar situation, you will know how to handle it.
