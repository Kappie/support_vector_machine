 I'm sure this is one of those things that like everyone on the internet already has seen, but honestly, I was in tears.  My personal favorites:  urlLink Bean and Mushroom Salad  (salad as in jello salad, horrifyingly enough),  urlLink Inspiration Soup , and the incomparable  urlLink Frankfurter Spectacular!  (exclamation point mine, but really it needed it, no?)
