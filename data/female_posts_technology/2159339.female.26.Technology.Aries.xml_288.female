We cancelled our plans to see a movie with friends last night so we can go home and crash, but instead stayed up until midnight with maps and guidebooks and laptops spread over my bed, looking up routes and campsites. There are still phone calls to be made, information to be gathered, and rules to be agreed upon, but overall I think we're in good shape. I'll even admit that despite my initial hesitation, our little excercise in cohabitation is going rather well. Sure, he sleeps in until 11 and then takes another nap at 4, but as a result of all that rest he is very responsive to my naggy demands, like taking my car to the shop or picking me up from work. And, at the risk of sounding unfeminist, it's nice to come home after work and have someone else make decisions regarding dinner and evening plans. This definitely makes me see the appeal of a housewife.  He asked me the other night whether I think we'll be together forever. I stared at him with a crazy bewildered look in my eyes (which he couldn't see because it was pitch dark) and told him that since he is essentially leaving me to go live on the other side of the continent, no I don't. I reminded him that we're breaking up next Sunday. Which makes me a little sad, but, as has been done before, I will get used to the life of a singleton and fill my time with things more productive than snuggling all day with a boy. Let's see...studying for the GRE, my design  HTML classes, fruit picking with roomies, consuming huge amounts of alcohol with roomies, going to baseball games with Ira, sewing, cooking, and if I still have time left after all that insane productivity, visiting moms and pops and dog Oscar at the 'moms' compound on the other side of the park. Sigh..
