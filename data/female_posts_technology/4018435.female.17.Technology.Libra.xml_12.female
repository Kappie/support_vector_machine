Gotta love the turbo blow off valve...omg...i love that sound...I'ma get me one when I get a nice car...       Let's see....who did I see today out of nowhere? Lisa stopped by my store. HAven't talked to her in a while. Miss that chick. Um...Meggo surprised me when she came in with Ian at my store. I didn't know that she'd be back from vermont so soon. Who else?....ah yes...I saw mike...       What was i saying to Amanda? That's right...I told her on msn just now that now matter how much i hate a person, It kills me to see them breakdown...Yeah...I have a soft heart...sometimes too soft...so soft that I forget about how badly I'd get hurt...I wonder why i care for peopel so much sometimes... When I saw mike breakdown i couldn't let go of him...I can't believe that he thought we would still be together these past 3 weeks...How could he? He left without telling me, he was back on sunday...he didn't call me...And today, Kevin and I were driving around with the movie camera and we suddenly turned onto mikes street and I Shoed kevin where he lived. I saw mike's car had moved from his usual parking spot...It broke my heart that night...remembering that night and what i saw hurts me now...How he lived as though I weren't alive...It hurts..It hurts...It kills...but I'm living on. I'm trying..Yes, I'm taking deep breaths and remember how beautiful life is without remember people like Mike's parents...and i recall his brother telling the world about mike and my personal life...yeah...i'm not a big fan of that kid anymore...not at all... Mike has to remember that he makes his own decisions...and if he thinks his father is a wonderful man for telling an innocent girl crying on his doorstep to leave (no matter what the circumstances are)...then he's cold hearted and brainless. I've never met such horrible people in my life...and I feel terrible for saying that, but it's entirely true...       Cold hearted...brainless...selfish...rich...rude...snotty...narrowminded...conceited...those are the words that remind me of mikes family...  On a happier note for now...I'm looking forward to seeing my best friend shawn this weekend. I'm looking forward to talking to Megan tomorrow. I'm looking forward to seeing Heather when she gets' back and I'm looking forward to hearing from Josh when he's back frmo new York on saturday.  Yep...I'm still cleaning out my room. Almost done...Anyone got any boxes for me?...I can't wait for my new bed set...I'll finally live in my dream room and I'll be able to sit, relax and think in the atmosphere that I remember from my old house...    Your life is what you make of it...You are in control...  -The Lonewolf
