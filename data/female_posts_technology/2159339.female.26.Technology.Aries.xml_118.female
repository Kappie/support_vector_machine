           
      I just got this in my work email (it's from a word processor):   In order to serve you better, I’ll be off at 5pm to fetch my stylish new lenses (the better to see your typos and grammatical horrors with).  As they’re progressive lenses, I’ve been warned that I will likely be missing curbs, steps, and corners of walls for the next few days as I adjust from the 20-y.o. tortoise-shell atrocities that currently adorn my visage.  Then again, this sort of careening is nothing new for me.  See you (better) tomorrow…
