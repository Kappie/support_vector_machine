Getting ready for the journey ahead.  They chant songs.  There's a brotherhood among them, you can tell.  The camera lingers on each one of their faces, some of them smile or wink, or give the "thumbs up". Others look pensive or somber. Tired.  Then they jog, adrenaline pumping, behind their commander. Running in the rain, hours on hours.  Some faint. Others help them get up, make it through.  Their commander is tough, but encouraging.  The cameraman alongside capturing moments of weakness, and moments of courage. Camera bobbing along, covered in raindrops. Moments of deep camaraderie.  Then the ceremony. The tired soldiers, standing proud.  The camera once again, lingers on their faces: their eyes filled with strength and satisfaction. And admiration for themselves. Their comrades. Their commander.  The commander stands in front of the platoon. He speaks - a speech filled with patriotism and idealism. A speech inspiring and touching and moving and energizing. The soldiers watch him speak with adoration.  Goosebumps.  Then HE walks amongst the rows. Shaking their hands. Pinning a pin to their lapel. They thank him.   I watch with tears streaming down my cheeks. Watch them and a shiver runs down my spine.  My little brother. The commander.  My little brother.
