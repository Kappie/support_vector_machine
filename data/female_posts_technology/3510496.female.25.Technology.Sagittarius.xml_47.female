Anyway, 2 of the weddings were attended by PILs, so we simply  kirim .  Made our way to Bedok, to catch the one-sixth of the After-Sixsters' wedding, who's also a  urlLink blogger . She's wedded to a former poly-pal. I managed to meet the very pleasant  urlLink Ummi Nazif , but sans Baby Nazif (uwekkkkk, I very the  semangat  to play wip him you know).  Tapi sempat Ummi dia tarik I bergambar .   urlLink     Am still awaiting for pics taken at the groom's side.  Hubby willingly 'released' me to 4 of my girlfriends, who already planned to 'kidnap' me for the most-unwilling-to-watch-movie, The Village. I was seriously contemplating to 'escape' from the 'kidnappers', due to the rave of not-so-good reviews of the movie. But I can say, it's pretty wide off the mark.  It's definitely a better instalment than earlier Shyamalan work, The Sign. It's like watching Blast From The Past plus The Others plus Ali Baba  40 Thieves plus Little Red Riding Hood plus Twister. Ask me why, but it's simply my sensations, go and watch it, and you will know it.  (Spoilers ahead, but not so much lahhhhh)  - Good guys in yellow cloak, Bad guys in red cloak.  - Bad guys went around painting all doors in red ( kan dah cam crite Ali Baba )  - So, red, is the colour of curse, and disallowed in the village. Guess all the villagers were amissing red strawberries, red roses, red wine. So what happen to the redheads (Hihih...)?  - Adrien Brody, played a retard, was one of the guys in the red cloak (Hahah!!! now you know)  - Shyamalan made a 'cameo' appearance, but you better watch close, because most  potek  ones couldn't get him.  - Joaquin Phoenix died, despite his sweetheart's effort to brave through the  eerie  woods, and  cross the century , to get medicines for him.  After the show, Fiza dropped me at Haig Road, where hubby was waiting to pick me up. It must be the 'freezing' cinema that sent me off to hunger again, that I dragged hubby to sit down in the nearby hawker centre to have  yong taufu  and  mamak -style chicken chop.  Later we decided to catch the fireworks at Esplanade  . But  goondu  us, joined a could-be-few-hundred  goondus , hung around indoor stadium. At almost 8.40pm, the fireworks start to blast. We should know better, definitely that is not the strategic place to catch the Esplanade Fireworks. Thus, we could only hear the sounds of it, and remnants of the fire sparkles, which was of course block by the sporadic of condos there. If you were there, you could definitely see the chaotic turn, when hundreds of  goondus  raced to respective vehicles. It's useless. There's massive jam, everywhere nearby.  So we decided to hit Home Sweet Home, and choose School Of Rock, as our DVD-night. Roll the tape, please!    Anyway, it's past 12am. Happy 39th Xin-Jia-Po!!!
