Growing up she was a happy little girl that enjoyed how she lived; it wasn't because of money either, it was because her family worked together and supported eachother, she worked for the things she got, and it was a feeling of accomplishment to her. After reading this essay it didn't make me wish I had more, it made me wish that I had what she did. I have lots of respect for people who work for what they get.
