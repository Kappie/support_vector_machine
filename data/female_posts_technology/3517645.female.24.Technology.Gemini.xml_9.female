The kids didn't get a lot of the funny parts but they still loved it. Dylan would just laugh because everyone else in the theatre was laughing. It was cute. When we got home I noticed that Duane did actually paint some of the kitchen and he did some laundry, I was amazed, however the living room was twice as messy then it was in the morning before I left for work and he left food at and the dog go into it and made a mess all over the couch. It is weird no matter how much he does around the house I still always find something to point out to him that he didn't do right, one he left the paint can open and two he missed some places when he was painting like behind the frig and stove. So I just went to bed.   I got up late for work, 6:10. I am usually at work by 6:30. I jumped in the shower really quick, go dressed put the dog out and ran out the door. What a great way to start the day. Even though I went to bed at 10, I am still extremely tired. You ever wake up and just know it is going to be one of those days.   God I hope today goes by fast.
