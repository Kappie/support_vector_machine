I just think to myself "I don't really want to do that to my body", and it's gone.  For breakfast today I ate peeled baby carrots and onions (yum) with my green tea. Lunch today is a beautiful salad with:  mixed spring greens red and green peppers purple cabbage cucumber a couple cherry tomatoes shredded carrot sliced mushroom purple onion  Dressing: sesame seed oil  raspberry vinegar
