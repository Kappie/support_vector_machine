Didn't get anything since I don't need any and the prices are comparable to the ones in Singapore. Parents and some of us went to the 'red light district' to buy dinner while me and 2 other sis stayed behind to babysit the kids. It's suppose to be great hawker food there but it turns out to be quite expensive. It's quite yummy thou. My mum got scared by the rowdy environment. Apparently, 4 drug peddlers were trading near our flashy red car. My folks were not in the car but standing close by to keep watch. Just in case they dump some white powder under the car. I guess they just used our Singapore registered license car as a decoy. Or the red car is too flashy.   The 2nd day, we drove towards the Genting Highlands for some gambling. The trip up was winding but interesting cos we took a wrong turn and end up at the deserted scenic road instead of the expressway. After lunch, we split up. Some went to gamble, the young family with 2 kids went to the theme park, and my 2nd sis went to the Starbucks with her laptop to do her work and dozed. I tried my luck at the "Money Wheel" (wheel of fortune sorta thing) and won 75 ringgit. Actually I should have stopped when my winnings were 200RM but greed got the better of me. It was time to go and I collected my 75RM profit. Hehe.  We checked out of the service aptment on Sunday and drove towards Singapore. On the way, we dropped by Malacca to visit my bro-in-law's sister. Actually, he wanted to visit, we just tag along. We had a yummy lunch before setting off on a 4 hour ride home.   Still haven't had enough of gambling, parents, me and 3rd sis pull out our chair and started a game of mahjong. Dad wanted to recoup his loss at the casino but in the end, my 3rd sis was the lucky one to win $20 from the 3 of us. I'm sure we'll have another round one day. I can feel the gambling bug is still inside us. Haha.  For some reason, it seems to be a tradition for most family to gamble during Chinese New Year. I guess it's when families come together, eat, drink and gamble to entertain themselves. And 'they' say its the luckiest to gamble during the Chinese New Year.   I'll upload the photos as soon as I've got the time to do so. Hehe. =P
