And yes.  I realize that that sentence is grammatically incorrect.  And frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.  Whooo-eeee!! Crusty?  Maybe.    So, picture it.  Sicily, 1917.  Well, actually, Saskatoon, two weeks ago.  I had my weekend off, and Friday, my back started giving me a load of grief.  By Sunday, I was flat out, in bed.  Monday morning, I tried to earn my hero cookie and go to work.  I sat there, had my morning "coffee" with the gang, and was promptly sent home.  Thank you Robaxacet, you're a Godsend!!  The next day, I was much better, just having twinges.    Well, guess what.  Sunday, July 4th, the same thing.  Twinges.  Monday, I actually EARNED the hero cookie, and walked around the office, looking like Quasi Moto.  I'm certain that my patients thought I had been afflicted with some sort of disease.  One of my co-workers told me that I was walking around like someone had stuck a pickle in my bum!  Then, to top it all off, a migraine came to town.  I know, bitch, bitch, whine, whine.  But it really sucked!!  Today, I had to travel out of town, and again, I'm looking like Quasi Moto.  But whatever.  I will survive.  I will get better.  This won't stop me, and it sure as heck won't get in the way of my house painting that is coming up!  If anyone has some good backache remedies...wait a minute...someone would actually have to READ this to suggest any.  Never mind.  On the upswing, I finished my day early, so I dragged Dave, my husband, to Home Depot, where we checked out paint chips.  I think we've decided on some colours.  The dining room is going to be Tomato Red.  The living room is going to be done in a faux finish, called "frottage".  The base coat is called Del Sol, and the "frottaged" part is called Marigold Blossom.  It's an orangey-yellow color.  Very warm and inviting.  At least, that is what I think.  Well, enough whining for today.    Have a good one!  -J.
