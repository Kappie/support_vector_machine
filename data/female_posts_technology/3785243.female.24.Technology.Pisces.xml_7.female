Unfortunately, I am not able to link to her short stories, as they appear to be still under copyright.    However,  urlLink here  is an article containing excerpts of her writing, so you can get a taste of her writing style.  Her books are treasures and good reads, as she does an excellent job of crystallizing people's characters in words, as well as capturing the essence, both genteel and less refined, of the Deep South.  -- Aeryth
