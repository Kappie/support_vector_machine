EE were so talentedly avant-gardly angularly noisy. It was one of the last shows for Sarah Jaffe, the guitarist and the rightmost girl in the above pic. Why's she leaving? What, is she allergic to adulation? success?? acceptance??! popularity??!! Crazy american. The club was packed and swampy and when the show was over, I bought their first CD, Other Animals.  Openers:  urlLink Whysall Lane  - solid pop with Asian frontman. Hooray!  urlLink Tussle  - Indie-rave music. Repetitive instrumentals that last, like, 7 minutes. They put up a screen and projected tie-dye imagery. As Summer on The O.C. would put it: "EW!"
