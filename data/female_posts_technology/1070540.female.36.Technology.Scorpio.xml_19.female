Mawmaw called to see how Mymommie was doing.,...and how was her heart.  I told her that I think she is doing ok that I havent heard from her.  She started talking about what happen the other night and How she was told it was Mine and Misty's fault for taking the kids over there.  Well I told her it was my fault I am the one who asked Dad to watch the kids.  I am the one who was suppose to bring them over. If I knew what was going on then I would have not let my 4 children go.  I told her that I did not know what to say when the boys asked my what a Whore was.  She asked how Ken was...I told her that after the argument that him and mom had I was very worried about the both of them.  WEll the next thing I know I am getting another phone call from MOM......asking what did I tell MawMaw...well come to find out that mom told mawmaw she didnt cuss in front of the children and I let the cat out of the bag when I mentioned what the children heard...I didnt mean too...then she said why did you tell her what went on at my house..I didnt I just said they had an arguement.  Well Mom told me that she was going to tell Ken what a lousy DAD he is and that I am the one raising Brian.  That is not true.  Ken does alot with all of the kids and she has no right to say anything like that about my husband.  Well when I said yes he does do things with them she named off stuff a mom would normally do anyways....uugghh...THEN in the car Mawmaw called....She said she just got off the phone with mymommie and they had it out cause mawmaw told mymommie that she must not really love ken and brian and us because she is dragging us in it and hurting Ken in the process.  She then said that she told mymommie that if she is not careful about what she says around Brian then all that we have fought for will be gone.  That Stacey will find a way to take Brian away.  Then she said mom told her that if she called the HRS right now..that they would take all 4 kids away.  (this is not true.  i have been working real hard on getting caught up on all of this.) But me and my big mouth repeated what Mawmaw had said.  And Kimberly heard it.  The first thing Kimberly did when she got in the house was start throwing up.  It made her so upset. I asked her what was wrong and she asked me who would call the HRS  and make them take them away from me and Daddy (that is what our daughter calls ken).  I told her not to worry about it cause it would not happen...But I hated to see her have that reaction. I do love my family and I love mom and Dad...but why ...I dont understand any of this.  I am not going to question it I am not going to mention it to Ken....cause I dont want him any sicker than he is...but it does seem that I may have to start posting here alot to keep me sane.  I dont want to go off on anybody messing with my family.  But I will.  NOONE is going to seperate us 6.  THIS IS MY FAMILY and I will fight anyone who wants to tear us apart.
