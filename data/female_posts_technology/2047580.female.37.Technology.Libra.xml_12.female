The Mexicans eat a lot of fat and also suffer fewer heart attacks than the British or Americans.   The Japanese drink very little red wine and suffer fewer heart attacks than the British or Americans.   The Italians drink excessive amounts of red wine and also suffer fewer heart attacks than the British or Americans.   The Germans drink a lot of beer and eat lots of sausages and fats and suffer fewer heart attacks than the British or Americans.   CONCLUSION: Eat and drink what you like. Speaking English is apparently what kills you.  I wonder where do Australians fit here. I guess with the British and Americans.
