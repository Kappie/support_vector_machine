I know, the possibility of a sports-related bonding moment ("I like basketball too!  WE like basketball!") may be very tempting indeed, but have some consideration for those poor lanky souls who never succeeded in the one pursuit where abnormal height makes you a god.  They really don't need another person reminding them.  Side note:  when said tall person answers "no", responding with "well, you SHOULD" does NOT help.
