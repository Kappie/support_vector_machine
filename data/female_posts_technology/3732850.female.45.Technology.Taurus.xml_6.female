Then, they can buy everything that they want so that they can fit in with the rest of the crowd. If you asked some of your adults they would say "NO". I think money honestly changes people more then making them happy.    I don't think money can buy happiness what happens when you run out of money. I would say if anything it changes people in the way they look at society. You have those that were kind and happy with where they are and then they get more money then they had before they think they're better then the next person. I only want to live comfortable, I wouldn't want more then that. I'm happy now and I don't think I would be happy with more money. I like the idea that I earned the money to buy what I want.
